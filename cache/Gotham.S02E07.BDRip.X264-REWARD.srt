1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,630
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:05,924
That's for Reggie.

3
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:07,592
<i>Now, I don't know
what you want with Master Bruce,</i>

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,429
but I'm certain that his life's gonna be
a damn sight better without you in it.

5
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:14,933
I would be honored if you would
consider endorsing me for mayor.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,602
If you can give me your word
that we won't have to face it alone,

7
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:18,895
you'll have my endorsement.

8
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:21,064
It's been some time
since I had a meal like this.

9
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:24,609
You should come over more often.
We can, like, hang out or whatever.

10
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:25,777
I'd like that.

11
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:27,195
Let go of me, you freak!

12
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:28,530
Listen to me!

13
00:00:28,697 --> 00:00:29,906
I did it for you.

14
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,243
Kristen?

15
00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:36,788
And I've been following
the goings-on at Wayne Enterprises.

16
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:39,374
- What have you learned?
- That your father was a good man.

17
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,419
But in spite of that,
bad things happened at his company.

18
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:47,048
You were looking for Penguin's mother,
weren't you?

19
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:48,591
I have to obey him in all things.

20
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:52,887
Penguin has brainwashed this poor soul.
Can we help?

21
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:58,935
I'll leave you two to it.

22
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,983
<i>Father Creel.</i>

23
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:09,654
- Do you have the Wayne boy?
- Not yet, but soon.

24
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:10,822
I found your mother.

25
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:13,408
- Where?
- In a warehouse down by the port.

26
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:26,671
You're sure this is it?

27
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:28,173
<i>I'm sure, boss.</i>

28
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,216
Once my mother is safe,

29
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:32,844
we go after Galavan and his sister.

30
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,264
They're going to pay
for what they've done.

31
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:44,481
Mother?

32
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:46,816
Mother!

33
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:51,696
You're okay. Thank God!

34
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:55,867
Oswald? Is that really you?

35
00:01:56,743 --> 00:02:00,997
Your sweet face. Like a vision.

36
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:03,625
I'm taking you home. Okay?

37
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,710
No, no, no, no.

38
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:15,053
And there I was thinking you understood
the meaning of consequences.

39
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,055
Consequences, yes.

40
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:20,850
I assure you
that my understanding of consequences

41
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:24,229
will be made quite clear
once my mother is outside.

42
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,397
But we've had so much fun together.

43
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:31,528
My sister gets attached to her playthings,
so I must insist she stay.

44
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:33,947
And those bolt cutters, useless.

45
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:35,573
<i>The only way out of there</i>

46
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,243
is with this.

47
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:41,913
Very well.

48
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,083
Butch, shoot them both in the head
and grab the key.

49
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,919
- Oswald!
- Mother, I'm sorry,

50
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:50,797
but what they've done to you
will not stand!

51
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:57,136
I gave you an order!
Shoot them both in the head!

52
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,181
<i>Oswald!</i>

53
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:04,853
No.

54
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:07,480
No, no, no. That's not possible.

55
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:11,776
You have to obey me. You have to!

56
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:15,989
That time has passed. They fixed me.

57
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:19,826
Tabi is well versed
in the protocols of conditioning.

58
00:03:19,993 --> 00:03:23,413
There's always a trigger word
implanted during the process.

59
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:26,541
All I had to do was
get Butch to remember what it is.

60
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:29,294
I'll admit, it took a few tries.

61
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:31,629
And now,

62
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,465
here we are.

63
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,430
Please.

64
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,809
I can still be valuable. You'll see.

65
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:47,395
I so wish that were true.

66
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,564
Then kill me if you must, but let her go.

67
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,650
I'm begging you.

68
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:55,320
Doesn't look like begging to me.

69
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:58,239
Indeed. Half-hearted at best.

70
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,370
Please.

71
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:07,206
I'll do anything.

72
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:12,754
- Perhaps she has served her purpose.
- Mmm.

73
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:15,131
Don't pout.
You still have the former mayor.

74
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:18,009
He's so dull. He just moans all the time.

75
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:37,153
I told you everything would be okay.
Didn't I?

76
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:38,947
And it will be.

77
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,082
<i>No!</i>

78
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:50,917
No!

79
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:01,886
Oswald? What is wrong?

80
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:04,681
You look so sad.

81
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:10,395
Nothing's wrong, Mother. Nothing at all.

82
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:14,899
We're together now.
That's all that matters.

83
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:17,068
That's all that ever mattered, right?

84
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,153
Ever since

85
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:22,782
you were a little baby.

86
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,577
My little Cobblepot.

87
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,331
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,084
This is my fault.

89
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:36,462
Please forgive me. I'm so sorry.

90
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:39,007
For what?

91
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:43,261
You were always such a good boy.

92
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:51,102
Huh! No.

93
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,321
Kill him. Dump the bodies

94
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:05,199
anywhere.

95
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:10,413
You don't have the stomach
to kill me yourself?

96
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:14,667
No wonder your family was run out of town.

97
00:06:15,752 --> 00:06:18,629
You come from a long line of cowards!

98
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:24,510
Fine, fine.

99
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,520
Any last words?

100
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:36,314
Yes.

101
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,525
I am going to kill you.

102
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:42,278
Oh, God!

103
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:57,043
<i>You are a psychopath!</i>

104
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,380
I am not the man that you think I am.
I would never do anything to hurt you.

105
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:11,766
<i>Rise and shine.</i>

106
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:15,603
What are you doing here?

107
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:18,022
I banished you for good.

108
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:20,650
Almost. Love of a good woman and all that.

109
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,612
Though we both know
how that turned out. Yikes!

110
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:28,199
That was an accident.

111
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:30,326
I'm not that man.

112
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,246
I'm gonna make this right.

113
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,206
See, I knew you'd wake up all boo-hooey.

114
00:07:35,373 --> 00:07:37,250
<i>You probably have half a mind
to turn yourself in.</i>

115
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,085
Luckily, I have the other half.

116
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:42,547
- Do you like magic tricks?
- What?

117
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,049
Of course you like magic tricks.
After all, I do.

118
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:48,511
Well, guess what.
I can make a body disappear.

119
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:01,190
Where is she?

120
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,153
Where is Miss Kringle's body?

121
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:07,071
Open the envelope.

122
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:13,494
<i>"I hid her body
while you were catching some Z's.</i>

You went to my work last night?

126
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,798
Well, technically, you did.

127
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:28,467
I was just in the driver's seat,
so to speak.

128
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:32,263
How? You're a figment of my imagination.

129
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,474
A projection of impulse. Nothing more!

130
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,310
That is uncalled for.

131
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,395
Uncalled for?

132
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:45,651
You hijacked my body while I was asleep,
and you stole my dead girlfriend!

133
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:51,199
Okay. Yeah, it's true.
But I'm doing this for your own good.

134
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:55,661
If I was you, which, again, I sort of am,
I'd get cracking.

135
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:57,538
You do want to find the body first, right?

When are we gonna unleash a little hell?

There will be plenty of time
for unleashing hell and parties,

Young Bruce has become fond of you.

00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,584
Looks like you backed
the right horse. You trust him?

164
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:29,255
A Gotham politician?
About as far as I can throw him.

165
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:32,925
But if he gives the G.C.P.D.
what it needs, he's all right by me.

166
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:38,180
You know, Selina said Penguin was behind
the Wayne Enterprise fires.

167
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:39,432
So?

168
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,392
So first he's going
after mayoral candidates,

169
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,311
next thing you know,
he's burning down buildings?

170
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:44,562
It doesn't make any sense.

171
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:48,149
Guy's an abacus of crazy.
Nothing he does surprises me.

172
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:55,906
What the hell happened?

173
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:59,160
Penguin. He tried to kill our next mayor.

174
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,376
Mr. Cobblepot knew that
I was poised to win the election today,

175
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:09,920
and he came to me seeking an alliance.

176
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,881
And you refused.

177
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:15,217
I politely declined, yes.

178
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,844
So he stabbed you in the neck?

179
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:20,264
That seems like a pretty extreme reaction,
even for Penguin.

180
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:23,768
We've been trying to build a case
against Penguin since I got here.

181
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,020
We assume that he's behind
the earlier attacks

182
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,688
on the other candidates as well.

183
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:30,274
And this is the second time
he's tried to kill me.

184
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:31,609
The man is a menace.

185
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:34,612
And one that I fully intend
to put behind bars.

186
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,364
I assume you have something for me.

187
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,325
Arrest warrant for Oswald Cobblepot,

188
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:43,829
as well as search and seizures on
all his properties and known associates.

189
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,499
Quite a list. We'll get right on it.

190
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,334
- Anything else?
- Yes.

191
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:51,921
In light of recent events, Judge Turnball
has declared a state of emergency

192
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:54,548
and granted the Mayor's office
additional powers.

193
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,008
Meaning what exactly?

194
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:59,220
The moment I'm sworn in,
I'm implementing a curfew,

195
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:02,348
and I'm ordering your strike force
to begin door-to-door searches

196
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,643
until Mr. Cobblepot is apprehended.

197
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,396
You're talking about martial law?

198
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:12,691
We're talking about bringing
a dangerous fugitive to justice.

199
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:16,529
We'll be acting within our legal rights.
Am I right, Mr. Dent?

200
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:17,947
Absolutely.

201
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,741
You'll have our full support, sir.

202
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,159
Thank you, Captain.

203
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:23,828
Captain Barnes.

204
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:27,164
Detective Gordon.

205
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:30,584
You seem hesitant.

206
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:32,503
Cautious.

207
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:37,466
You told me we needed to use
every method at our disposal

208
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,135
to go after men like Penguin.

209
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,011
Men who don't play by the rules.

210
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,055
Desperate times call for a strong measure.

211
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:46,183
I have no problem going after Penguin
with everything we've got,

212
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,686
but if we start kicking down the doors
of average citizens

213
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:51,564
and policing through fear,
we're no better than he is.

214
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:53,858
People still need to trust us.

215
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,276
And they will.

216
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:59,864
Because at the end of the day,
all people want is to feel safe.

217
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,368
Just remember, Detective,

218
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:06,620
you came to me.

219
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,750
<i>Congrats, Mr. Mayor.</i>

220
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,304
<i>It is official.
Theo Galavan will be the Mayor of Gotham.</i>

221
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:26,390
<i>A crowd has gathered outside,
and the excitement is brimming.</i>

222
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:29,268
<i>And in just a moment, we'll also
be talking to many of the supporters</i>

223
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:31,937
<i>that gave up their time and effort
to support--</i>

224
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,068
- What do you have against the front door?
- Nothing.

225
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:42,156
It's the ape who opens it
who I could live without.

226
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,326
I haven't seen you in a month.

227
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,536
Selina, what are you doing here?

228
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:49,914
You wouldn't believe the week I've had.

229
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,083
This friend of mine, Bridgit,
decided to build this fire suit.

230
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,544
- Selina.
- Some people just don't...

231
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,131
Whose is that?

232
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,342
Sorry. I got lost on the way back from...

233
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:04,678
Hello.

234
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,181
Hi.

235
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:12,520
Silver St. Cloud,
this is my friend, Selina.

236
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,523
Selina, this is Silver.

237
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:16,857
Nice to meet you.

238
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:18,984
You too.

239
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:21,570
Are you staying for lunch?

240
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,030
- No.
- Please say you are.

241
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,866
I just moved here
and don't know many people.

242
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,953
Bruce, go tell Alfred
to set another place for lunch.

243
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:32,122
Come on, it'll be fun! Go, shoo.

244
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,591
While it's just us girls,

245
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:45,302
let me give you a little advice.

246
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:48,889
You come around here again,

247
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,142
well, that would be bad

248
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,437
for you.

249
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:58,107
Who the hell are you?

250
00:14:58,274 --> 00:14:59,858
I'm Bruce's friend.

251
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,070
His only friend.

252
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,911
And you're a piece of gutter trash.

253
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,247
Now tell me something.

254
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:16,959
Would anyone miss you
if, one day, you were just

255
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:18,919
gone?

256
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,881
I didn't think so.

257
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:25,217
<i>I told Alfred.</i>

258
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,264
What are you guys talking about?

259
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,141
Nothing.

260
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,351
Just girl stuff.

261
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,398
<i>"You'll need a helping hand."</i>

262
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:42,234
<i>"Look for her initials
down at the G.C.P.D."</i>

263
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,195
<i>"Look for her initials
down at the G.C.P.D."</i>

264
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,950
"Look for her initials
down at the G.C.P.D."

265
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,619
Kristen Kringle, "K.K."

266
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,829
K.K., K.K.

267
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,006
<i>No!</i>

268
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,258
Come on!

269
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:52,096
<i>Hey, Mike,
can you give me a hand with this?</i>

270
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,555
<i>It's really heavy.</i>

271
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:09,279
Putting Penguin in the crosshairs of
the G.C.P.D. will drive him underground.

272
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,990
We can't kill him if we can't find him.

273
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,161
We won't have to find him.
He's going to deliver himself to us.

274
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:18,122
And why would he do that?

275
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:22,626
Penguin's rage
will consume his better judgment,

276
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:26,463
leaving him with an insatiable craving
for revenge.

277
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,508
All we have to do is keep him hungry

278
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:31,969
and then invite him to dinner.

279
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,098
And then I get to kill him.

280
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:37,725
Yes, kitten.

281
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,729
Then you get to kill him.

282
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,902
<i>I'm eager to get to work.</i>

283
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,488
<i>I'd also like to address
the recent attempt on my life</i>

284
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,574
<i>by the man known as Penguin.</i>

285
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:57,995
<i>It is true that he attacked me,
and as of now, he is still at large.</i>

286
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:01,039
<i>Men such as Penguin
will no longer be tolerated.</i>

287
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:05,502
<i>These are men who scurry from
the light of decency like cockroaches.</i>

288
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:09,506
<i>Men who not even a mother could love.</i>

289
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,936
He dies. Tonight.

290
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,196
<i>Yeah, got it.</i>

291
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,573
Gilzean's holed up
in a booze joint downtown.

292
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,033
- Penguin?
<i>- Mmm-mmm.</i>

293
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:39,578
And get this. Word on the street is
Gilzean's started his own crew.

294
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:42,664
Sounds like they had a falling out.
Maybe he's ready to talk.

295
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:44,041
Yeah.

296
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,418
Hey. I heard about
what happened to our new mayor.

297
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,545
- Never a dull moment, huh?
- No kidding.

298
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,589
You left your keys again this morning.

299
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:51,965
Oh.

300
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,510
What's this one?

301
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,553
A key to my apartment.

302
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,515
- Oh.
- I'll be in the car.

303
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:01,892
What? It's just a key.

304
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:04,061
Yeah, I know. Uh...

305
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,355
Do you want a key to my place?

306
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:09,024
Not even a little bit.
Wait, do you have a place?

307
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,359
I think so.

308
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:13,153
Sorry, caught me off guard.
I guess I do spend most nights there.

309
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,740
Which I love. What I don't love
is hauling ass out of bed at 2:00 a.m.

310
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:19,743
when you come home from a stakeout
smelling of chili dogs.

311
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,913
I love to watch you squirm.

312
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,665
I was not squirming.

313
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:26,166
A little squirm.

314
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,007
I had no idea we were entertaining today,
Master Bruce.

315
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,219
Anyone else popping by?

316
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:39,012
<i>No. Thank you, Alfred.</i>

317
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,139
This is marvelous, Alfred.

318
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:44,309
I fell in love with Lapsang Souchong
when I lived in Fujian.

319
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,936
Driving through the Wuyi region,

320
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,313
all you could smell is the burning cedar
they use to smoke leaves.

321
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,859
Right. Well, technically,
it's, uh, pinewood, Miss,

322
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,944
but I appreciate the enthusiasm.

323
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,285
That smell really does slap you
in the face, doesn't it, Alfred?

324
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:05,664
So, Selina,

325
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,624
<i>tell me about yourself.</i>

326
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,459
Any family?

327
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:12,212
You really buying her act?

328
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:14,631
I beg your pardon?

329
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,135
Let me ask you a question.

330
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:22,222
- How long have you been a two-faced slut?
- Selina!

331
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,974
No, seriously, what are you after?

332
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:27,769
It's the money, right?
I mean, it's not his wacky sense of humor.

333
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,897
- I think I should go.
- No, wait.

334
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,356
Is that a tear?

335
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,318
You're good.

336
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:37,112
I'm sorry. Goodbye, Bruce.

337
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,239
Silver.

338
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,618
What did you just do?

339
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:47,289
I know you're not the best judge
of, like, you know, people,

340
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,666
but that girl is bad news.

341
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,543
I just did you a favor.

342
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,171
I want you to leave.

343
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,468
Fine. Whatever.

344
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:00,719
Maybe you're right.

345
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,848
Maybe I'm not the best judge of people.

346
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:10,437
Because all this time,
I thought you were my friend,

347
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,816
but clearly you have no idea
what that means.

348
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,343
"I'm tired of hiding
and want to be free.

349
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,305
"To locate her body,
find the two things missing from me."

350
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:49,726
Back of her head kind of looks funny.
It's like the top of a pencil.

351
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,396
Why are you doing this?

352
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:57,067
Because it's fun! And it's good for you.

353
00:21:57,234 --> 00:22:01,530
How is it good for me to be tortured,
to be driven insane?

354
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:06,368
I'm trying to show you who you are.
How have you not realized that yet?

355
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:11,289
Though, to be honest, I'm surprised
you haven't figured out this riddle yet.

356
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,749
Should I have made it easier?

357
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,626
You could start by using proper grammar.

358
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:17,462
A period at the end of a sentence is...

359
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:20,716
<i>M,</i> period, <i>E,</i> period.

360
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:24,219
Oh, God! M.E., medical examiner.

361
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:26,096
You didn't!

362
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,597
I did.

363
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:41,153
I say we wait and see
if someone can walk us inside,

364
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,030
<i>try and keep things civil.</i>

365
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:49,036
Did I tell you
I was thinking about getting a cat?

366
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:51,455
What?

367
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:55,083
Hey, how are you? Why don't you
get your head in the game here?

368
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,334
I'm sorry.

369
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:57,919
It's just...

370
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,797
Do you believe Galavan's story?

371
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:04,760
Questions like that are above my pay grade
and below my sense of wonder.

372
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:06,094
Penguin's a pragmatist.

373
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:10,223
Hitting Galavan for refusing an alliance,
that doesn't get him anything but heat.

374
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:12,392
So what really happened, do you think?

375
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:15,645
A few months ago,
nobody knew who Galavan was, right?

376
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:17,647
Now all of a sudden, he's mayor?

377
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:22,110
Doesn't happen by accident.
It takes planning and it takes help.

378
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:26,448
Guys like Galavan are born on third base.
Stealing home is practically a birthright.

379
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:28,325
Think about the timing.

380
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:32,162
He shows up
just after Mayor James disappears.

381
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,791
A massacre at the gala
turns him into a hero.

382
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:38,835
Penguin's assassination attempts
on mayoral candidates

383
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,421
launched his campaign.

384
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:44,341
Everything that's gone down
up to this point,

385
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:46,384
you could argue was orchestrated.

386
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:49,596
Look, what you're talking about
is Machiavellian-level crazy,

387
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:51,848
even by Gotham's standards.

388
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,225
Yeah.

389
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:58,897
Here's our door pass.

390
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,861
<i>Yeah, so your mother tells you.</i>

391
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:07,906
Yeah, his mama
stopped talking to me ages ago.

392
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:09,157
Oh, finally!

393
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,995
- Hey, hey!
- I wouldn't.

394
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,039
Oh, come on!

395
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:17,541
I really wouldn't.

396
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,046
That's a lot of firepower there, Butch.

397
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,882
You expecting company?

398
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,926
Neighborhood ain't
what it used to be, Jim.

399
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:29,219
Where's Penguin?

400
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:31,304
How should I know?

401
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:34,099
You're the boss's lapdog
and you don't know where your owner is?

402
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:37,561
I ain't nobody's lapdog, not anymore.

403
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:38,895
Prove it.

404
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,398
Tell us why the hell
Penguin went after Galavan.

405
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:43,567
I ain't telling you anything.

406
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:47,028
And unless you have a warrant,
I'm gonna have to ask you boys to leave.

407
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:51,741
Yeah, see, the thing is our newly elected
mayor kind of wants results on this.

408
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,828
So we drag you in, chances are,
that's where you're gonna stay.

409
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,914
<i>I'm here for Gilzean.</i>

410
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:04,588
Anyone who leaves now, leaves alive.

411
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,426
<i>Any who stays, dies.</i>

412
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,805
<i>You have 60 seconds to do the math.</i>

413
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,307
Sorry, Butch.

414
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,186
Seriously?

415
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:22,105
No honor among scumbags, huh?

416
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:24,232
Hey, don't shoot. I'm out of here.

417
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:34,492
What are you doing?

418
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:37,287
You tell us what the hell
is going on with Penguin,

419
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:38,788
or we leave you with Zsasz.

420
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:39,956
You can't do that.

421
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:42,167
- Bullock?
- We can totally do that!

422
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:45,921
Galavan was telling Penguin what to do.

423
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:48,089
Knocking off the candidates,
torching the buildings,

424
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:49,674
it all came down from Galavan.

425
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:51,468
Why the hell was Penguin taking orders?

426
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,803
Kidnapped Penguin's mother.

427
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,972
- He was keeping her for leverage.
- Kidnapped?

428
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:00,060
Jim? I think we need to go.

429
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:02,479
I didn't think Galavan
would actually go through with it...

430
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:05,774
Go through with what?
Go through with what?

431
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,740
G.C.P.D.! Put down your weapons!

432
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,675
We're outmanned here big time, partner.

433
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,844
Yeah. But not outgunned.

434
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:36,721
Oh, hell yeah!

435
00:26:58,493 --> 00:27:02,038
<i>I'll take that as a no.
See you later, Butch.</i>

436
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:11,506
That's a new one.

437
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:15,385
You think he was telling the truth?

438
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,637
Nobody's telling the truth.

439
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:19,389
This is Gotham.

440
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:29,816
Bruce.

441
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:32,235
What a lovely surprise!

442
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:36,281
Hello, sir. I was looking for Silver.

443
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:38,408
She's here.

444
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:40,910
Seemed a bit upset when she came in.

445
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:42,495
Yes, sir.

446
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:45,790
A friend of mine stopped by the house
while Silver was there. They--

447
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:48,918
Say no more. I was your age once.

448
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,754
Your feelings do you credit.

449
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,963
I never met your father,

450
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,675
but it's clear that he instilled in you
a sound moral compass.

451
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:57,761
He did.

452
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:03,308
You know, we're both very alike.

453
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:10,106
Born into wealth and privilege,
yet forced to walk our lives alone.

454
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,901
Haunted by loss.

455
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:16,905
<i>Driven to prove ourselves worthy
of those who came before.</i>

456
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:21,159
Be careful, Bruce.

457
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:24,871
That way of thinking,
the need to fill the void,

458
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:26,915
it can consume you.

459
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:28,958
Does it ever go away?

460
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,211
No, but

461
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:35,924
you can find closure,
a way to move on without letting go.

462
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:37,592
How?

463
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,762
Well,
I don't want to make any promises,

464
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:43,807
but when the time is right,
we'll talk again.

465
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:52,816
I, uh, need to get ready for the party.
Excuse me.

466
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,321
I knew you'd come.

467
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,083
No one is to kill Galavan but me.
Understand?

468
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,626
Boss, I got what you're feeling.

469
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:14,921
A mother's love, it's the most beautiful,
most simple--

470
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,172
Gabe!

471
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:19,759
Cops aren't gonna let you
within 100 feet of Galavan.

472
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:22,720
Let us whack him for you. Please?

473
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,180
No.

474
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:26,141
He's mine.

475
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:31,521
Now, let's get dressed.

476
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,691
We've got a party to attend.

477
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:37,235
Listen up, people!

478
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,366
Our newly elected mayor is going ahead
with his victory celebration tonight.

479
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:48,246
He will be exposed, he will be vulnerable

480
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,333
and he will be protected by you,

481
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:55,587
the brave men and women
of this police force.

482
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,423
You all have your assignments.

483
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:02,218
Detective Gordon here
will be running point. Detective.

484
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:08,892
Penguin has already made one attempt
on Galavan's life today.

485
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,894
We should be ready for anything.

486
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:15,064
Let's show this city
what it means to carry a badge.

487
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:16,566
As you were!

488
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,746
I want check-ins from perimeter teams
every five minutes.

489
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:32,040
Martinez, how's the Avenue looking?

490
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:36,669
All clear. Sniper teams
alpha and bravo report all clear as well.

491
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:38,630
Copy that.

492
00:30:39,422 --> 00:30:40,632
What'd you find out?

493
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:43,092
Spoke to the super
at Gertrude Kapelput's building.

494
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:45,595
Turns out, no one has seen her
for two weeks.

495
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,597
Timeline matches Gilzean's story.

496
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:51,518
Maybe, or maybe the old broad's
on a sunset cruise. Hmm?

497
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:55,772
You know, there's something
that Gilzean said that I can't shake.

498
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:57,982
He said he never thought
Galavan would go through with it.

499
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:59,275
Go through with what?

500
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:02,987
I don't think Gertrude Kapelput
is on a cruise.

501
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:05,114
Ladies and gentlemen,

502
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:09,869
let me be the first
to officially introduce you

503
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:13,790
to the Honorable Theo Galavan,

504
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:15,917
the new mayor of Gotham!

505
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:12,056
Ed.

506
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:13,558
Oh, my...

507
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:15,018
What are you doing?

508
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:17,979
Dr. Thompkins. Hello.

509
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:19,188
Uh...

510
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:23,484
I'm just double-checking notes
for a Jane Doe case I'm working.

511
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:24,736
Do you need help?

512
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:27,113
No. No, no, no. She's all gone.
Uh, she's...

513
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,534
I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm all done with checking my notes.

514
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:33,369
Uh, what notes?

515
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:37,790
It's all up here.

516
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:41,711
Do you realize that by assigning
simple mnemonic devices to case files,

517
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:43,421
you can produce recall capacity

518
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:46,215
equal to that of photographic
or even eidetic memory?

519
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,302
- Ed, what's going on?
- Okay.

520
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:50,553
Sorry.

521
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:53,056
Um, truth be told,

522
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:57,560
uh, I was hoping
to run into you here. Alone.

523
00:32:58,144 --> 00:32:59,729
It's Miss Kringle.

524
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:03,232
Just...
We had a fight.

525
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,445
I'm sorry.

526
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,741
Every relationship
hits a rough patch now and then.

527
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,577
And you've been so supportive.

528
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:17,705
And I was hoping that maybe
we could go grab a coffee,

529
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,290
and you could give me some advice.

530
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:21,334
Do you want to finish up
what you were doing first?

531
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:24,045
No, no, no.
No, I can come back another time.

532
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:26,381
It's not like they're gonna
go anywhere, right?

533
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:27,548
You'd think so.

534
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:29,092
Yeah, okay.

535
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:39,936
Detective Gordon.

536
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:42,313
<i>Okay. That's it, sir. Perfect.</i>

537
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:43,564
Thank you so much.

538
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:47,527
I, uh, heard about your shootout today.

539
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:51,572
Something about one of Penguin's
former lieutenants. A Butch Gilzean?

540
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:54,617
Some men ambushed us
as we were questioning him.

541
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:55,952
He escaped.

542
00:33:56,869 --> 00:34:00,123
Did you get anything out of him
before the attack?

543
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:02,709
No.

544
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,128
It's a pity.

545
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:08,464
Well.

546
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:12,885
<i>Mr. Mayor!</i>

547
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:17,682
<i>Detective,
I have a large group of men</i>

548
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:19,517
approaching from off the main road.

549
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,238
I have eyes on the target.
Appears to be Cobblepot, sir.

550
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:35,783
Hold your fire.
Perimeter units, prepare to engage.

551
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:40,329
The target is down!

552
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,331
Martinez, I said, "Hold your fire!"

553
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:43,583
<i>It wasn't us.</i>

554
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:45,668
We have an unknown shooter on the roof.

555
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:48,588
<i>I repeat, we have an unknown shooter
on the roof.</i>

556
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:02,727
Martinez, is Penguin dead?

557
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:07,774
No. It wasn't him.

558
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,401
Find the other shooter and find Penguin!
We need him alive!

559
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:15,573
<i>Detective,
all the targets are dressed as Penguin,</i>

560
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,284
and all are heavily armed.
Positive ID is impossible.

561
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:23,456
Martinez, you're clear to engage.

562
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,958
All perimeter units,
crash our location now.

563
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:55,738
Drop it.

564
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:59,283
Turn around. Hands above your head. Now.

565
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:03,162
So forceful.

566
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:06,207
I like a strong, confident man.

567
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:27,436
<i>Help!</i>

568
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:31,232
Oh, my God!

569
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,860
We got to get you out of here.

570
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:36,821
Radio his driver. Have him pull the car
around to the back service entrance.

571
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:37,989
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

572
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:39,782
- Cover us?
- No problem.

573
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:52,295
<i>Remaining
officers, stay inside and clear the lobby.</i>

574
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:54,630
<i>Confirmed. Primary is on the move.</i>

575
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:56,799
<i>Initiating exit plan
near the south entrance.</i>

576
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:59,468
<i>Roger that. Detective Gordon is en route</i>

577
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:01,220
<i>to the rear entrance with the Mayor.</i>

578
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:04,140
<i>Need their limo
at the back service entrance, stat.</i>

579
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:06,392
<i>Copy that.</i>

580
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:12,023
Get him out of here!

581
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:16,986
Down!

582
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:21,782
Hello, Jim.

583
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,328
Please step aside.

584
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:27,330
You know I can't do that.

585
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,124
You would if you knew
what kind of man you were protecting.

586
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,959
Shoot him, Detective.

587
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:36,505
Oswald, listen to me.
You have to put the gun down!

588
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:40,468
He killed my mother, Jim.

589
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:42,678
I know.

590
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:49,852
Detective Gordon, I am ordering you
to put that man down now!

591
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:52,396
He had her murdered in front of me.

592
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:56,776
I held her, watched her die.

593
00:37:58,277 --> 00:37:59,862
Do you know what that's like?

594
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:02,615
It changes a person.

595
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:04,325
<i>I'm sorry
about your mother, Penguin,</i>

596
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:09,038
but I'm gonna need you to put the
shotgun down on the ground slowly. Now.

597
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,752
One of us is going to die tonight.

598
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:16,796
<i>I have made my peace with that.</i>

599
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:20,091
I suggest the new mayor does as well.

600
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,259
Don't make us shoot you.

601
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:25,054
Shoot me, and you have no idea
what his endgame is, Jim!

602
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:29,934
And you should,
because it concerns someone you know,

603
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:32,186
someone you care about.

604
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:34,146
Shoot him.

605
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:36,607
Duck!

606
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:49,954
Jim! Oswald!

607
00:39:04,802 --> 00:39:07,179
Penguin smashed the Mayor's ride
through the main checkpoint.

608
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:10,516
The good news is, with the gunshot wound
to the shoulder and the APB,

609
00:39:10,683 --> 00:39:12,101
I doubt he'll make it out of the city.

610
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:14,061
He won't be trying to make it out.

611
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:20,234
We lost more people tonight, good people,
including Martinez.

612
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:22,820
Sometimes, the good guys have a bad night.

613
00:39:22,987 --> 00:39:24,280
This ain't your fault.

614
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:25,740
I know.

615
00:39:27,158 --> 00:39:28,492
It's his.

616
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:33,205
My ancestors were swordsmiths.

617
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:38,419
They knew that to make good steel,
it had first to be forged.

618
00:39:39,587 --> 00:39:41,505
I look at tonight...

619
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:46,635
<i>I look at tonight as a baptism of fire.</i>

620
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:50,097
<i>A fire from which we will emerge stronger.</i>

621
00:39:50,264 --> 00:39:56,312
<i>Our resolve forged
to bring about a new day in Gotham!</i>

622
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:03,652
I've felt pretty alone since moving here.

623
00:40:05,738 --> 00:40:06,989
Until I met you.

624
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:12,119
But I don't want to come
between you and a friend.

625
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:14,038
You won't.

626
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:16,207
Selina is never going to like me.

627
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,168
I don't care.

628
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:22,838
I like you.

629
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,564
- Detective Gordon.
- Mr. Mayor.

630
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:43,109
You catch my speech?

631
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:45,111
I think I've heard enough speeches.

632
00:40:46,362 --> 00:40:48,322
I had high hopes for you.

633
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:52,284
I thought you were prepared
to make the hard choices,

634
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:56,539
to do whatever it takes
to rid Gotham of its monsters.

635
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:58,874
I am.

636
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:01,710
I've just decided

637
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:04,713
I'm going to start with you.

638
00:41:09,218 --> 00:41:11,178
Dangerous words

639
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:15,141
when addressing the man
who now controls this city.

640
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,563
Desperate times.

641
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:23,732
They are indeed.

642
00:41:56,265 --> 00:41:58,350
I want to know why you did this.

643
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:02,646
When Dr. Thompkins walked in the room,
how did it feel?

644
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:05,941
I was terrified.
She could have discovered the body.

645
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:07,776
But she didn't.

646
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:09,945
You got away with it.

647
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:11,780
That's not the point!

648
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:14,700
That is absolutely the point!

649
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:19,455
You can still feel the rush, can't you?

650
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:22,458
Coming so close to getting caught.

651
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:25,669
Knowing what you
would have been forced to do

652
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:28,130
if she had discovered the body

653
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:30,841
discovered what you had done.

654
00:42:31,008 --> 00:42:33,719
The pulse of that moment.

655
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:38,641
Standing at the edge of uncertainty
and peering into the void.

656
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:43,145
Now tell me. How did it feel?

657
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:54,198
Beautiful.

658
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:05,811
