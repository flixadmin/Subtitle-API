00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,967
Peter.

4
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,563
Your mama wants to speak with you.

5
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,806
Come on, Pete.
Take these fool things off.

6
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,883
Why have you been fighting
with the other boys again, baby?

7
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,686
Peter?

8
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,369
They killed a little frog
that ain't done nothing.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,526
Smushed it with a stick.

10
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,201
You're so like your daddy.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,843
You even look like him.

12
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,202
And he was an angel.

13
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,331
- Composed out of pure light.
- Mer?

14
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,403
You got a present there for Peter,
don't you?

15
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,924
Of course.

16
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,201
There.

17
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,723
I've got you covered, Pete.

18
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,969
You open it up when I'm gone, okay?

19
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,044
Your grandpa...

20
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,611
Is gonna take such good care of you.

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,560
At least until your daddy
comes back to get you.

22
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,401
Take my hand.

23
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,646
Peter.

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,321
Pete, come on.

25
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,364
Take my hand.

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,447
Mom?

27
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,810
No! No! No! No!

28
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,246
Mom! No!

29
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,925
- Come with me.
- No!

30
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,804
No!

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,731
You've got to stay here. Please.

32
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,241
No...

33
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,090
Okay?

34
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,680
No.

35
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,964
Mom!

36
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,520
Drop it!

37
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,080
Uh, hey.

38
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,841
- Drop it, now!
- Hey, cool, man. No problem.

39
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,922
No problem at all.

40
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,285
How do you know about this?

41
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,930
I don't even know what that is.

42
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,521
I'm just a junker, man.
I was just checking stuff out.

43
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,121
You don't look like a junker.
You're wearing ravager garb.

44
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,520
This is just an outfit, man.

45
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,045
Ninja turtle, you better stop poking me.

46
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,201
What is your name?

47
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,282
My name is Peter Quill, okay?
Dude, chill out.

48
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,051
- Move!
- Why?

49
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,083
Ronan may have questions for you.

50
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,641
Hey, you know what?

51
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,888
There's another name
you might know me by.

52
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,528
Star-Lord.

53
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,841
Who?

54
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,201
Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw.

55
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,722

- Move!

57
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,130
Peter?

58
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,081
What happened?

59
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,682
Hey, uh... uh... I...

60
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,443
- Bereet.
- Bereet!

61

you should have delivered him
like we was hired to do!

You're the only one I'm being soft on!

My government
knows no shame.

110

You Xandarians and your culture
are a disease.

You will never rule Xandar.

No.

Master, he is a thief,

an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord.

117
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,360
But we have discovered
he has an agreement

118
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,285
to retrieve the orb
for an intermediary known

119
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,930
as the broker.

120
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,522
I promised Thanos
I would retrieve the orb for him.

121
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,206
Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.

122
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,482
Nebula, go to Xandar
and get me the orb.

123
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,406
It will be my honor.

124
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,567
It will be your doom.

125
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,326
If this happens again,
you'll be facing our father

126

without his prize.

127
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,770

Just like you.

129
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,891
But I know Xandar.

130
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,650
Ronan has already decreed that I...

131
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,801
Do not speak for me.

132
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,282
You will not fail.

133
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,650
Have I ever?

134
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,531
Xandarians.

135
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,847
What a bunch of losers.

136
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,369
All of them in a big hurry

137
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,523
to nothing at all. Pathetic.

138
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,961
Look at this guy!

139
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,610
Can you believe they call us criminals,

140
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,603
when he's assaulting us
with that haircut?

141
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,930
What is this thing?
Look how it thinks it's so cool.

142
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,561
It's not cool to get help!
Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.

143
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,643
Look at Mr. Smiles over here.

144
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,001
Where's your wife, old man?
What a Class-A prevert.

145
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,209
Right, Groot?

146
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,801
Groot?

147
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,723
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot.

148
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,087
- That's disgusting!
- Mmm.

149
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,488
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it.

150
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,686
Why are you lying?

151
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,131
Whoop.

152
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,242
Looks like we got one.

153
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,405
Okay, humie, how bad
does someone wanna find you?

154
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,044
40,000 units?
Groot, we're gonna be rich!

155
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,371
- Mr. Quill.
- Broker.

156
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,721
The orb.

157
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,762
- As commissioned.
- Where's Yondu?

158
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,609
Wanted to be here. Sends his love.

159
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,721
And told me to tell you,

160
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,081
that you got the best eyebrows
in the business.

161
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,327
What is it?

162
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,448
It's my policy never to discuss
my clients, or their needs.

163
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,522
Yeah, well, I almost died
getting it for you.

164
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,610
An occupational hazard,
I'm sure, in your line of work.

165
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,561
Some machine-headed freak,
working for a dude named Ronan.

166
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,883
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill.

167
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,047
I truly am.

168
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,804
But I want no part of this transaction

169
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,803
- if Ronan is involved.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

170
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,961
Who's Ronan?

171
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,408
A Kree fanatic,
outraged by the peace treaty,

172
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,769
who will not rest
until Xandarian culture, my culture,

173
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,041
- is wiped from existence!
- Whoa, whoa!

174
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,531
- Come on.
- He's someone

175
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,120
whose bad side I'd rather not be on.

176
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,810
What? What about my bad side?

177
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,251
Farewell, Mr. Quill.

178
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,925
Hey, we had a deal, bro!

179
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,081
What happened?

180
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,244
Ah, this guy just backed out
of a deal on me.

181
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,482
If there's one thing I hate,
it's a man without integrity.

182
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,330
Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.

183
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,081
You have the bearing of a man of honor.

184
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,328
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.

185
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,050
People say it about me, all the time,

186
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,685
but it's not something
I would ever say about myself.

187
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,681
Ooh!

188
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,601
This wasn't the plan.

189
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,560
Ah!

190
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,322
Put him in the bag.
Put him in the bag!

191
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,727
No! Not her, him!

192
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,291
Learn genders, man.

193
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,011
Ow!

194
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,849
Biting? That's not fair!

195
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,969
Take it easy!

196
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,726
Ow!

197
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,364
Fool. You should have learned.

198
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,289
I don't learn. One of my issues.

199
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,650
What the...

200
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,003
Quit smiling, you idiot.
You're supposed to be a professional.

201
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,805
You gotta be kidding me.

202
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,609
Ooh. Hey!

203
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,726
I live for the simple things.

204
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,087
Like how much this is gonna hurt.

205
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,002
Yeah. Writhe, little man.

206
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,605
It'll grow back, you d'ast idiot.

207
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,210
Quit whining.

208
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,809
<i><font color="#80ffff">Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.</i></font>

209
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,005
Aw, crap.

210
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,565
By the authority of the Nova Corps,

211
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,449
- you are under arrest...
- All right. Come on up.

212
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,761
<i><font color="#80ffff">For endangerment to life
and the destruction of property.</i></font>

213
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,929
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

214
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,289
- Star-Lord.
- Oh, sorry. "Lord."

215
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,522
I picked this guy up a while back
for petty theft.

216
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,085
He's got a code name.

217
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,207
Yeah. Stay out of the way.

218
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,169
Come on, man. It's a...
It's an outlaw name.

219
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,969
Just relax, pal.

220
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,247
It's cool to have a code name.
It's not that weird.

221
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,245
Fascists.

222
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,841
<i><font color="#80ffff">Ronan is destroying</i></font>

223
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,127
<i><font color="#80ffff">Xandarian outposts
throughout the galaxy.</i></font>

224
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,205
I should think that would call for some
slight response on the part of the Kree.

225
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,006
<i><font color="#80ffff">We signed your peace treaty,

<i><font color="#80ffff">What more do you want?</i></font>

227
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,164
At least a statement
from the Kree empire

228
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,481
saying that they condemn his actions.

229
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,081
He is slaughtering children.

230
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,607
Families.

231
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,047
<i><font color="#80ffff">That is your business.</i></font>

<i><font color="#80ffff">Now, I have other matters to attend to.</i></font>

233
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,601
Prick.

234
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,210
Well, some good news.

235
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,449
It looks like we've apprehended
one of Ronan's compatriots.

236
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,081
Gamora.

237
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,166
Surgically modified
and trained as a living weapon.

238
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,800
The adopted daughter
of the mad titan, Thanos.

239
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,369
Recently, Thanos lent her
and her sister Nebula out to Ronan,

240
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,729
which leads us to believe that Thanos
and Ronan are working together.

241
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,084
Subject 89P13. Calls itself "Rocket."

242
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,725
The result of illegal genetic

243
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,330
and cybernetic experiments

244
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,680
on a lower life form.

245
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,804
What the hell?

246
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,725
They call it "Groot."

247
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,326
A humanoid plant
that's been traveling recently

248
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,609
as 89P13's
personal houseplant/muscle.

249
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,765
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

250
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,004
Raised from youth by a band
of mercenaries called the Ravagers,

251
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,924
led by Yondu Udonta.

252
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,570
Oh, I'm sorry.

253
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,610
I didn't know how this machine worked.

254
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,842
What a bunch of a-holes.

255
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,846
Transport all four to the Kyln.

256
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,088
I guess most of Nova Corps
wanna uphold the laws,

257
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,608
but these ones here,
they're corrupt and cruel.

258
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,002
But, hey, that's not my problem.

259
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,730
I ain't gonna be here long.

260
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,282
I've escaped 22 prisons.
This one's no different.

261
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,771
You're lucky the broad showed up,

262
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,080
because otherwise, me and Groot

263
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,963
would be collecting that bounty
right now,

264
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,963
and you'd be getting
drawn and quartered

265
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,087
by Yondu and those Ravagers.

266
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,367
I've had a lot of folks
try to kill me over the years.

267
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,205
I ain't about to be brought down
by a tree and a talking raccoon.

268
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,321
Hold.

269
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,360
- What's a raccoon?
- "What's a raccoon?"

270
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,720
It's what you are, stupid.

271
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,645
Ain't no thing like me, except me.

272
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,606
So, this orb has
a real shiny blue suitcase,

273
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,729
"Ark of the Covenant,
Maltese Falcon" sort of vibe.

274
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,651
- What is it?
- I am Groot.

275
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,450
So what? What's the orb?

276
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,728
I have no words for an honorless thief.

277
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,127
Pretty high and mighty
coming from the lackey

278
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,406
of a genocidal maniac.

279
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,403
Yeah, I know who you are.

280
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,482
Anyone who's anyone
knows who you are.

281
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,170
Yeah, we know who you are.

282
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,766
- Who is she?
- I am Groot.

283
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,808
Yeah, you said that.

284
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,000
I wasn't retrieving the orb for Ronan.

285
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,810
I was betraying him.

286
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,962
I had an agreement
to sell it to a third party.

287
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,291
I am Groot.

288
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,684
Well, that's just as fascinating
as the first 89 times you've told me that.

289
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,842
What is wrong with 'Giving Tree,' here?

290
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,287
Well, he don't know
talking good like me and you.

291
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,445
So his vocabulistics is limited
to "I" and "am" and "Groot."

292
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,170
Exclusively in that order.

293
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,527
I tell you what,
that's gonna wear real thin, real fast.

294
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,361
Hey- put that away!

295
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,802
Hey!

296
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,121
Listen to me, you big blue bastard!
Take those headphones off!

297
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,930
That's mine. Those belong to impound.

298
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,923
That tape and that player is mine!

299
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,484
<font color="#ffff00">Hooked on Feeling,
Blue Swede,1973.</font>

300
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,050
That song belongs to me!

301
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,724
- You first! You first!
- Murderer!

302
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,731
Coming for you first, Gamora!
You're dead!

303
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,044
You're scum! You're scum!

304
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,209
It's like I said,
she's got a rep.

305
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,169
A lot of prisoners here
have lost their families

306
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,402
to Ronan and his goons.

307
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,686
She'll last a day, tops.

308
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,086
Murderer!

309
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,920
The guards will protect her, right?

310
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,367
They're here to stop us from getting out.

311
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,443
They don't care
what we do to each other inside.

312
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,082
Whatever nightmares the future holds,

313
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,881
are dreams
compared to what's behind me.

314
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,770
Check out the new meat.

315
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,606
I'm gonna slather you up
in Gunavian jelly,

316
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,046
and go to town...

317
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,489
Let's make something clear.

318
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,689
This one here is our booty!

319
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,203
You wanna get to him,

320
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,529
you go through us!

321
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,681
Or, more accurately,

322
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,561
we go through you.

323
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,364
I'm with them.

324
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,610
I hate you.

325
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,926
No cell's gonna protect you for long.

326
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,691
You're dead!

327
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,241
Dead!

328
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,960
Take her down to the showers.

329
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,129
It'll be easier to clean up
the blood down there.

330
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,206
Quill, where you going?

331
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,567
Quill.

332
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,363
Quill!

333
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,922
Gamora, consider this a death sentence

334
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,208
for your crimes against the galaxy.

335
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,486
You dare?!

336
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,569
You know who I am, yes?

337
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,566
You're Drax.

338
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,802
The Destroyer.

339
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,961
Quill!

340
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,963
And you know
why they call me this?

341
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,691
You slayed dozens of Ronan's minions.

342
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,250
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,

343
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,688
and my daughter, Camaria.

344
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,289
He slaughtered them where they stood.

345
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,009
And he laughed!

346
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
Quill?

347
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,286
Her life

348
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,048
is not yours to take.

349
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,051
He killed my family.

350
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,721
I shall kill one of his in return.

351
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,367
Of course, Drax. Here, I...

352
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,760
Quill! What are you doing?

353
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,448
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.

354
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,724
I'm your only hope at stopping him.

355
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,649
Ah!

356
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,371
Woman, your words
mean nothing to me!

357
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,046
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Oh, crap.

358
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,362
You know, if killing Ronan
is truly your sole purpose,

359
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,400
I don't think this is
the best way to go about it.

360
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,523
Are you not the man
this wench attempted to kill?

361
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,926
Well, I mean,
she's hardly the first woman

362
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,041
to try and do that to me.

363
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,369
Look, this is from
a smoking-hot Rajak girl.

364
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,966
Stabbed me with a fork.

365
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,088
Didn't like me skipping out on her
at sunrise.

366
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,686
I got, right here, a Kree girl
tried to rip out my thorax.

367
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,888
She caught me with
this skinny little A'askavariian

368
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,041
who worked in Nova records.

369
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,730
I was trying to get information.

370
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,529
You ever see an A'askavariian?

371
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,409
They have tentacles,
and needles for teeth.

372
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,801
If you think I'm seriously interested
in that, then...

373
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,366
You don't care. But here's the point.

374
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,924
She betrayed Ronan.
He's coming back for her.

375
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,686
And when he does,

376
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,123
that's when you...

377
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,771
Why would I put
my finger on his throat?

378
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,247
What?

379
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,521
Oh, no, it's a symbol.

380
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,884
This is a symbol
for you slicing his throat.

381
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,368
I would not slice his throat.

382
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,165
I would cut his head clean off.

383
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,408
It's a general expression
for you killing somebody.

384
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,085
You've heard of this.
You've seen this, right?

385
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,640
- You know what that is.
- Yeah. Yeah.

386
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,404
- Everyone knows.
- No, no.

387
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,484
What I'm saying is,
you want to keep her alive.

388
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,567
Don't do his work for him.

389
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,962
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.

390
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,162
- That was my favorite knife.
- Listen!

391
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,403
I could care less
whether you live or whether you die.

392
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,285
- Then why stop the big guy?
- Simple.

393
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,080
You know where to sell my orb.

394
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,481
How are we gonna sell it
when we and it are still here?

395
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,801
My friend Rocket, here,

396
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,646
has escaped 22 prisons.

397
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,481
Oh, we're getting out.

398
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,484
And then we're headed straight
to Yondu to retrieve *your* bounty.

399
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,281
How much was your buyer
willing to pay you for my orb?

400
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,801
Four billion units.

401
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,525
- What?
- Holy shit.

402
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,487
That orb is my opportunity to
get away from Thanos and Ronan.

403
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,441
If you free us,

404
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,845
I'll lead you to the buyer directly

405
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,649
and I'll split the profit
between the three of us.

406
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,484
I am Groot.

407
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,961
Four of us.

408
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,122
Asleep for the danger,
awake for the money,

409
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,201
as per frickin' usual.

410
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,646
<i><font color="#80ffff">You have been betrayed, Ronan.</i></font>

411
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,844
We know only that
she has been captured.

412
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,922
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

413
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,369
<i><font color="#80ffff">No! Our sources within the Kyln say
Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.</i></font>

414
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,091
<i><font color="#80ffff">Look, your partnership with Thanos</i></font>

415
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,004
<i><font color="#80ffff">is at risk.</i></font>

416
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,487
<i><font color="#80ffff">Thanos requires your presence. Now!</i></font>

417
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,126
With all due respect, Thanos,
your daughter made this mess,

418
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,725
and yet you summon me.

419
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,723
I would lower my voice, accuser.

420
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,882
First, she lost a battle
with some primitive.

421
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,769
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

422
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,651
Then she was apprehended
by the Nova Corps.

423
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,643
You are the one here
with nothing to show for it.

424
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,805
Your sources say that she meant
to betray us the whole time!

425
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,166
Lower your tone!

426
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,361
I may be your...

427
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,451
I only ask that you take
this matter seriously.

428
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,281
The only matter
I do not take seriously, boy,

429
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,966
is you.

430
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,206
Your politics bore me.

431
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,443
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

432
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,242
And, apparently, you alienated
my favorite daughter, Gamora.

433
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,809
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

434
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,689
if you bring me the orb.

435
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,080
But return to me again empty-handed,

436
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,604
and I will bathe the starways
in your blood.

437
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,809
Thanks, dad. Sounds fair.

438
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,851
This is one fight you won't win.

439
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,764
Let's head to the Kyln.

440
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,486
If we're gonna get out of here,

441
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,360
we're gonna need to
get into that watchtower.

442
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,200
And to do that,
I'm gonna need a few things.

443
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,804
The guards wear security bands

444
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,327
to control their ins and outs. I need one.

445
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,165
Leave it to me.

446
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,170
That dude, there.
I need his prosthetic leg.

447
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,930
- His leg?
- Yeah.

448
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,162
God knows I don't need the rest of him.
Look at him, he's useless.

449
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,641
All right.

450
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,044
And finally, on the wall back there
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

451
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,202
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

452
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,410
There's a Quarnyx battery behind it.
Purplish box, green wires.

453
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,642
To get into that watchtower,
I definitely need it.

454
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,165
How are we supposed to do that?

455
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,527
Well, supposably,
these bald-bodies find you attractive.

456
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,250
so, maybe you can work out
some sort of trade.

457
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,481
You must be joking.

458
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,369
No, I really heard
they find you attractive.

459
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,090
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

460
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,606
and it's in the middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

461
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,445
It's impossible to get up there
without being seen.

462
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,567
I got one plan,

463
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,768
and that plan requires
a frickin' Quarnyx battery,

464
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,921
so figure it out!

465
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,126
Oh!

466
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,283
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

467
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,283
Now, this is important.

468
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,930
Once the battery is removed,

469
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,446
everything is gonna slam
into emergency mode.

470
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,251
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,

471
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,210
so you definitely need to get that last.

472
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,042
Or we could just get it first
and improvise.

473
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,202
- I'll get the armband.
- Leg.

474
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,281
<i><font color="#80ffff">Prisoner,</i></font>

475
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,245
drop the device immediately
and retreat to your cell,

476
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,329
or we will open fire.

477
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:47,291
I am Groot!

478
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,805
Fire!

479
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,767
All prisoners return
to your sleeping areas.

480
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,765
You idiot!

481
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,605
How am I supposed to fight
these things without my stuff?

482
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,325
The animal is in control.

483
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,528
Fire on my command!

484
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,325
Creepy little beast!

485
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,963
Oh, yeah.

486
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,729
You need my what?

487
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,405
- I'll need this.
- Good luck.

488
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,971
It's internally wired.

489
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,770
I'll figure something out.

490
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,884
Drop the leg!

491
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,566
Drop the leg
and move back to your cell!

492
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,811
Rocket!

493
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,001
Move to the watchtower!

494
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,007
You!

495
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,604
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!

496
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,122
It was one time, man.

497
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,451
We need all available guards
in full combat gear...

498
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,926
Whoa!

499
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,330
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

500
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,487
Why is this one here?

501
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,520
We promised him he could stay
by your side until he kills your boss.

502
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,920
I always keep my promises,

503
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,650
when they're
to muscle-bound whack-jobs

504
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,360
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.

505
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,410
Oh, I was just kidding about the leg.

506
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,640
I just need these two things.

507
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,409
- What?
- No, I thought it'd be funny.

508
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,561
Was it funny?

509
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,404
Oh, wait, what did he look like
hopping around?

510
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,448
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!

511
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,600
How are we going to leave?

512
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,045
Well, he's got a plan.

513
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,920
Right? Or is that
another thing you made up?

514
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,485
I have a plan! I have a plan!

515
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,250
Cease your yammering

516
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,970
and relieve us
from this irksome confinement.

517
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,485
Yeah, I'll have to agree
with the walking thesaurus

518
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,404
on that one.

519
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,960
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

520
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,841
It's just a metaphor, dude.

521
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,850
His people are completely literal.
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

522
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,570
Nothing goes over my head.

523
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,803
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.

524
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,326
I'm gonna die surrounded by
the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

525
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,851
Those are some big guns.

526
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,321
On my command!

527
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,241
Number one!

528
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,201
Rodent, we are ready for your plan.

529
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,124
Hold on!

530
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,969
Number two!

531
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,649
I recognize this animal.

532
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,961
We'd roast them over a flame pit
as children.

533
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,320
Their flesh was quite delicious.

534
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,601
Not helping!

535
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,761
Number three!

536
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,651
All fire on my command!

537
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,161
Three!

538
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,846
Two!

539
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,441
One!

540
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,609
He turned off the artificial gravity,

541
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,728
everywhere but in here.

542
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,323
I told you I had a plan.

543
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,280
That was a pretty good plan.

544
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,721
Huh?

545
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,886
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.

546
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,925
It's the Milano, the orange and blue one
over in the corner.

547
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,764
They crumpled my pants up into a ball!

548
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,922
That's rude! They folded yours!

549
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,123
The orb's there. Let's go.

550
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,891
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

551
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,689
That bastard didn't put it back.

552
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,686
- Put what back?
- Here.

553
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,569
Get them to the ship. I will be right back.

554
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,246
- How are you gonna possibly...
- Just keep the Milano close by.

555
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,606
Go.

556
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,046
Go!

557
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,169
Ah, my neck!

558
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,360
Well, how's he gonna get to us?

559
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,568
He declined to share
that information with me.

560
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,641
Well, screw this, then!

561
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,568
I ain't waiting around
for some humie with a death wish.

562
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,926
You got the orb, right?

563
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,690
Yes.

564
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,051
If we don't leave now,
we will be blown to bits.

565
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,121
No!

566
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,202
We're not leaving without the orb.

567
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,171
Behold.

568
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,768
This one shows spirit!

569
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,724
He shall make a keen ally
in the battle against Ronan.

570
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,321
Companion, what were you retrieving?

571
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,124
You're an imbecile.

572
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,641
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

573
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,160
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?

574
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,846
You can't take apart my ship
without asking me!

575
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,843
- See, what is this?
- Don't touch that!

576
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,921
It's a bomb.

577
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,001
- A bomb?
- Yup.

578
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,804
And you leave it lying around?

579
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,530
I was gonna put it in a box.

580
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,727
What's a box gonna do?

581
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,042
- How about this one?
- No! Whoa. Hey!

582
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,201
- Leave it alone.
- Why? What is it?

583
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,770
- Shut up.
- Hey!

584
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,127
What is that?

585
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,011
That's for if things get really hardcore.

586
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,726
Or if you wanna blow up moons.

587
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,290
No one's blowing up moons.

588
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,522
You just wanna suck the joy
out of everything.

589
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,802
So, listen, I'm gonna need
your buyer's coordinates.

590
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,130
We're heading in the right direction.
For now.

591
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,680
If we're gonna work together,
you might wanna try trusting me a little bit.

592
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,285
And how much do you trust me?

593
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,450
I'd trust you a lot more
if you told me what this was.

594
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,284
Because I'm guessing
it's some kind of weapon.

595
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,726
I don't know what it is.

596
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,121
If it's a weapon,
we should use it against Ronan.

597
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,203
Put it down, you fool!
You'll destroy us all.

598
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,321
Or just you, murderess!

599
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,084
I let you live once, princess!

600
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,288
- I am not a princess!
- Hey!

601
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,001
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!

602
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,247
We're stuck together
until we get the money.

603
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,528
I have no interest in money.

604
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,960
Great.

605
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,323
That means more money
for the three of us.

606
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,567
Mmm?

607
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,729
For the four of us.

608
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,201
Partners.

609
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,884
We have an agreement,

610
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,000
but I would never be partners
with the likes of you.

611
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,084
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.

612
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,448
And Quill, your ship is filthy.

613
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,605
Oh, she has no idea.

614
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,202
If I had a black light,

615
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,760
the would look like
a Jackson Pollock painting.

616
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,129
You got issues, Quill.

617
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,441
I swear.
I don't know where they went! I swear.

618
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,686
If he knew
where they were headed,

619
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,960
he would have already told us.

620
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,001
Yeah.

621
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,561
Ronan,

622
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,803
the Nova Corps sent a fleet
to defend the prison.

623
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,881
Well, then,

624
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,249
send Necrocraft
to every corner of the quadrant.

625
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,802
Find the orb. Any means, any price.

626
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,371
And this place?

627
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,000
The Nova can't know what we're after.

628
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,409
Cleanse it!

629
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,441
Do you got any other
cute little buggers like this one?

630
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,441
I like to stick 'em all in a row
on my control console.

631
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,922
I can't tell if you're joking or not.

632
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,202
He's being fully serious.

633
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,601
In that case, I can show you...

634
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,561
But first, you gonna tell me
what this orb is,

635
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,847
and why everybody cares
so damn much about it.

636
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,164
And then you gonna tell me,

637
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,448
who out there might wanna buy it.

638
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,251
Sir, the high-end community is a...

639
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,288
The high-end community is a...

640
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,126
It's a tight-knit...
Tight-knit...

641
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,081
The high-end community
is a very tight-knit...

642
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,645
I cannot possibly betray

643
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,884
the confidentiality of my buyers!

644
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,447
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?

645
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,525
Carina.

646
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,726
Yes, master.

647
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,804
Your people do have elbows,
do they not?

648
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,731
We do, master.

649
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,850
Then use them.

650
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,565
I don't have to remind you

651
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,689
what happened to the last attendant
who disappointed me.

652
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,651
<i><font color="#80ffff">Do I?</i></font>

653
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,484
Chop, chop.
Our guests will be here soon.

654
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,886
Heads up! We're inbound!

655
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,561
Whoa.

656
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,321
What is it?

657
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,328
<i><font color="#80ffff">It's called Knowhere.</i></font>

658
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,370
<i><font color="#80ffff">The severed head
of an ancient celestial being.</i></font>

659
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,569
Be wary headed in, rodent.

660
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,883
There are no regulations
whatsoever here.

661
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,130
Hundreds of years ago,
the Tivan group sent workers in

662
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,806
to mine the organic matter
within the skull.

663
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,087
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid.

664
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:39,127
All rare resources, highly valued
in black markets across the galaxy.

665
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,087
It's dangerous and illegal work,
suitable only for outlaws.

666
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,969
Well, I come from a planet of outlaws.

667
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,681
Billy the Kid,

668
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,808
Bonnie and Clyde, John Stamos.

669
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,490
It sounds like a place,
which I would like to visit.

670
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,607
Yeah, you should.

671
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,127
Excuse me.

672
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,567
- Watch your wallets.
- Can you spare any units?

673
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,650
Get out of here.

674
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,848
Your buyer's in there?

675
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,129
We are to wait here
for his representative.

676
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,765
Get out of here!

677
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,127
This is no respectable establishment.

678
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,328
What do you expect us to do
while we wait?

679
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,246
Yes! Yes!

680
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,126
Whoa!

681
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,651
Yahoo!

682
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,364
My orloni has won, as
I won at all things!

683
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,725
Now, let's put more of this liquid
into our bodies.

684
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,851
That's the first thing you said
that wasn't bat-shit crazy!

685
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,289
Man, you wouldn't believe
what they charge for fuel out here.

686
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,601
I might actually lose money on this job.

687
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,410
My connection is making us wait.

688
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,851
It's just a negotiation tactic.
Trust me, this is my specialty.

689
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,883
Where yours is more,

690
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,925
"stab, stab. Those are my terms."

691
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,605
My father didn't stress diplomacy.

692
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,841
Thanos?

693
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,965
He's not my father.

694
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,571
When Thanos took my home world,

695
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,001
he killed my parents in front of me.

696
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,001
He tortured me, turned
me into a weapon.

697
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,525
When he said he was going to destroy
an entire planet for Ronan,

698
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,648
I couldn't stand by and...

699
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,522
Why would you risk your life for this?

700
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,204
My mother gave it to me.

701
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,931
My mom liked sharing with me all the
pop songs that she loved growing up.

702
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,161
I happened to have it on me,

703
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,363
when I was...

704
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,963
The day that she...

705
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,124
You know, when I left Earth.

706
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,280
What do you do with it?

707
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,086
Do? Nothing. You listen to it.
Or you can dance.

708
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:09,882
I'm a warrior and an assassin.
I do not dance.

709
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,201
Really?

710
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:15,570
On my planet,
there's a legend about people like you.

711
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,006
It's called

712
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,566
'Footloose'.

713
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:24,211
And in it, a great hero
named Kevin Bacon,

714
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,762
teaches an entire city full of people with
sticks up their butts that dancing, well...

715
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,923
It's the greatest thing there is.

716
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,324
Who put the sticks up their butts?

717
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,925
What? No, that's just a...

718
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,889
- That is cruel.
- It's just a phrase

719
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,247
people use.

720
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,922
The melody is pleasant!

721
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,202
- No!
- Ow! What the hell?

722
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,725
I know who you are, Peter Quill!

723
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,089
And I am not some starry-eyed waif
here to succumb to your...

724
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,408
your pelvic sorcery!

725
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,000
That is not what is happening here.

726
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,929
Oh, no!

727
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,491
Stop it!

728
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,120
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

729
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,403
This vermin speaks of affairs
he knows nothing about!

730
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,483
- That is true!
- He has no respect!

731
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,007
- That is also true!
- Hold on! Hold on!

732
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,162
Keep calling me
vermin, tough guy!

733
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,402
You just wanna laugh at me
like everyone else!

734
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,131
Rocket, you're drunk. All right?
No one's laughing at you.

735
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,011
He thinks I'm some stupid thing!
He does!

736
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,162
Well, I didn't ask to get made!

737
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,682
I didn't ask to be torn apart,

738
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,763
and put back together, over and over

739
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,002
and turned into some...

740
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,281
some little monster!

741
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,369
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.

742
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,648
He called me "vermin"!

743
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,406
She called me "rodent"!

744
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,925
Let's see if you can laugh

745
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,049
after five or six good shots
to your frickin' face!

746
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,651
No, no, no, no!

747
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,962
Four billion units! Rocket!

748
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,160
Come on, man. Hey!

749
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,201
Suck it up for one more lousy night

750
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,010
and you're rich!

751
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,886
Fine.

752
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,805
But I can't promise, when all this is over

753
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,530
I'm not gonna kill
every last one of you jerks.

754
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,202
See? That's exactly why
none of you have any friends!

755
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,491
Five seconds after you meet somebody,
you're already trying to kill them!

756
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,531
We have traveled,
halfway across the quadrant.

757
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,682
and Ronan is no closer to being dead.

758
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,088
- Drax!
- Let him go.

759
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,486
We don't need him.

760
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,883
Milady Gamora.

761
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,889
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

762
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,123
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.

763
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,404
We house the galaxy's
largest collection

764
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,566
of fauna, relics,
and species of all manner.

765
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,401
I present to you,

766
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,606
Taneleer Tivan, 'The Collector.'

767
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,528
Oh, my dear Gamora.

768
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,721
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

769
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,440
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

770
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,406
We have what we discussed.

771
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,922
What is that thing there?

772
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,809
I am Groot.

773
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,530
I never thought I'd meet a Groot.

774
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,125
Sir...

775
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,083
You must allow me to pay you now
so that I may own your carcass.

776
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,130
At the moment of your death, of course.

777
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,526
I am Groot.

778
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,445
Why, so he could turn you
into a frickin' chair?

779
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,561
That's your pet?

780
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,530
- His what?!
- Tivan.

781
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,881
We have been halfway
around the galaxy, retrieving this orb.

782
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,128
Very well, then.

783
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,760
Let us see what you brought.

784
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,171
Three Quarnyx batteries,
seven cases of cotati seeds.

785
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:07,886
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...
Uh...

786
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,244
You shall send a message for me.

787
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,085
Oh, my new friends.

788
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,569
Before creation itself,

789
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,449
there were six singularities.

790
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,401
Then the universe exploded
into existence,

791
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,608
and the remnants of these systems

792
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,207
were forged into concentrated ingots.

793
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,247
Infinity Stones.

794
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,890
These stones, it seems,

795
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,883
can only be brandished

796
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,522
by beings of extraordinary strength.

797
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,727
Observe.

798
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:52,768
These carriers can use the stone
to mow down entire civilizations

799
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,367
like wheat in a field.

800
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,127
There's a little pee
coming out of me right now.

801
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,166
Once, for a moment,

802
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,370
a group was able to share
the energy amongst themselves,

803
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,490
but even they
were quickly destroyed by it.

804
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,369
Beautiful.

805
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,640
Beyond compare.

806
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,722
Blah, blah, blah.

807
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,486
We're all very fascinated, 'whitey',
but we'd like to get paid.

808
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,765
How would you like to get paid?

809
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,968
What do you think,
fancy man? Units!

810
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,521
Very well, then.

811
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,485
Carina.

812
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,801
Stand back.

813
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,125
I will no longer be your slave!

814
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,725
No!

815
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,121
What the...

816
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,361
How could I think Tivan could contain
whatever was within the orb?

817
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,562
What do you still have it for?!

818
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,971
What are we gonna do,
leave it in there?!

819
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,963
I can't believe you had that
in your purse!

820
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,841
It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

821
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,729
We have to bring this
to the Nova Corps.

822
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,731
There's a chance they can contain it.

823
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,881
Are you kidding me?

824
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,804
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.
Just give it to Ronan!

825
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,200
So he can destroy the galaxy?

826
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,169
What are you,
some Saint all of a sudden?

827
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,289
What has the galaxy ever done for you?
Why would you wanna save it?

828
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,169
Because I'm one of the idiots
who lives in it!

829
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,685
Peter, listen to me.

830
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,969
We cannot allow the stone
to fall into Ronan's hands.

831
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,724
We have to go back to your ship,

832
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,370
and deliver it to Nova.

833
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,921
Right, right, okay. I think you're right.

834
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,645
Or we could give it to somebody
who's not going to arrest us,

835
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,884
who's really nice for
a whole lot of money.

836
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,566
I think it's a really good balance
between both of your points of view.

837
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,721
You're despicable.

838
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,401
Dishonorable.

839
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,041
Faithless!

840
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,330
- Oh, no.
- At last!

841
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,366
I shall meet my foe and destroy him!

842
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,249
You called Ronan?!

843
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:56,129
Quill! Don't you move, boy!

844
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,408
Don't you move! Get out of the way!

845
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,766
Ronan the Accuser!

846
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,366
You are the one
who transmitted the message?

847
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,771
You killed my wife.

848
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,529
You killed my daughter!

849
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,800
I told you, you can't fit.
Now, wait here. I'll be back.

850
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,762
It is Gamora.
She is escaping with the orb.

851
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,210
No!

852
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,321
Nebula,

853
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,810
retrieve the orb.

854
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,243
The stone
is in the furthest pod.

855
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,206
Bring it down!

856
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,241
Ah!

857
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,929
Rocket, keep them off Gamora
until she gets to the Milano.

858
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,481
How? We've got
no weaponry on these things.

859
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,404
These pods are industrial grade.

860
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,760
<i><font color="#80ffff">They're nearly indestructible.</i></font>

861
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:47,047
Not against Necroblasts, they're not.

862
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,164
That's not what I'm saying.

863
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,486
Oh!

864
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,324
Let me borrow your ride.

865
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,923
I don't recall killing your family.

866
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,608
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

867
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:40,084
Quill, I'm trapped!
I can't make it to the Milano!

868
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,721
I have to head out!

869
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,168
Wait! These things
aren't meant to go out there!

870
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,129
You are a disappointment, sister.

871
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,803
Of all our siblings,

872
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,165
I hated you least.

873
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,846
<i><font color="#80ffff">Nebula, please.</i></font>

874
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,644
If Ronan gets this stone

875
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,809
<i><font color="#80ffff">- he'll kill us all.
- Not</i></font> all.

876
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,204
You will already be dead.

877
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:06,769
<i><font color="#80ffff">Ronan, it is done.</i></font>

878
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,807
<i><font color="#80ffff">Quill, come on.</i></font>

879
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,846
<i><font color="#80ffff">Her body mods should keep her alive
a couple more minutes,</i></font>

880
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,002
<i><font color="#80ffff">but there's nothing we can do for her.</i></font>

881
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,720
<i><font color="#80ffff">These pods
aren't meant to be out here.</i></font>

882
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,241
<i><font color="#80ffff">In a second, we're gonna be
in the same boat.</i></font>

883
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,081
Aw, damn it.

884
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,845
<i><font color="#80ffff">Quill?</i></font>

885
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,764
Yondu! Yondu.

886
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,167
<i><font color="#80ffff">This is Quill!</i></font>

887
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,801
<i><font color="#80ffff">- My coordinates are 227K324.
- Quill.</i></font>

888
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,201
Quill, what are you doing?

889
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,805
Just outside Knowhere.

890
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,088
If you're there, come get me!

891
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,290
I'm all yours!

892
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,728
<i><font color="#80ffff">Quill, don't be ridiculous.</i></font>

893
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,448
<i><font color="#80ffff">Get back into your pod!</i></font>

894
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,883
<i><font color="#80ffff">You can't fit two people in there.
You're gonna die.</i></font>

895
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,963
You'll die in seconds!

896
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,441
Quill.

897
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,170
Quill?

898
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,330
What happened?

899
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,528
I saw you out there.

900
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,400
I don't know what came over me.

901
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,203
But I couldn't let you die.

902
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,441
I found something inside of myself.

903
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:36,168
Something incredibly heroic.

904
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,446
I mean, not to brag,

905
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,886
but, objectively...

906
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,047
Where's the orb?

907
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,121
It's... well, they got the orb.

908
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,327
What?

909
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,520
Welcome home, Peter.

910
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,165
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!

911
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,767
Quill just got himself captured.

912
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:27,209
None of this ever would have happened
if you didn't try to single-handedly

913
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,600
take on a frickin' army!

914
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:31,600
You're right.

915
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,402
I was a fool.

916
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,569
All the anger,

917
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,043
all the rage,

918
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,527
was just to cover my loss.

919
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:59,449
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo.
"My wife and child are dead."

920
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,207
Oh, I don't care if it's mean!

921
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,249
Everybody's got dead people.

922
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,570
It's no excuse to get everybody else

923
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,649
dead along the way!

924
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,125
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the stone.

925
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,568
The only chance we got is
to get to the other side of the universe

926
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,529
as fast as we can and maybe,

927
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,989
just maybe, we'll be
able to live full lives

928
01:10:24,002 --> 01:10:26,322
before that whack-job
ever gets there.

929
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,165
I am Groot.

930
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,607
Save them? How?

931
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,525
I am Groot.

932
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,365
I know they're the only friends
that we ever had,

933
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,171
but there's an army
of Ravagers around them.

934
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,970
And there's only two of us!

935
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,240
Three.

936
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,126
Aw!

937
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,561
You're making me

938
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,290
beat... up

939
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,481
grass!

940
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,729
The orb is in my possession,

941
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,365
as I promised.

942
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,045
<i><font color="#80ffff">Bring it to me.</i></font>

943
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:11,528
Yes, that was our agreement.

944
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,930
Bring you the orb,

945
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:17,647
and you will destroy Xandar for me.

946
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:22,362
However, now that I know
it contains an Infinity Stone,

947
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,522
I wonder what use I have for you.

948
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,205
<i><font color="#80ffff">Boy,</i></font>

949
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,966
<i><font color="#80ffff">I would reconsider your current course.</i></font>

950
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,361
Master! You cannot!

951
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,046
Thanos is the most powerful being
in the universe.

952
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,330
Not anymore.

953
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,401
You call me "boy!"

954
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:07,122
I will unfurl 1,000 years of Kree justice
on Xandar,

955
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,807
and burn it to its core!

956
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,048
Then, Thanos, I am
coming for you.

957
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,324
After Xandar,
you are going to kill my father?

958
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,643
You dare to oppose me?

959
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,643
You see what he has turned me into.

960
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:28,964
If you kill him, I will help you
destroy a thousand planets.

961
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,321
You betray me?

962
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,201
Steal my money?

963
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,924
Stop it! Leave him alone!

964
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,402
When I picked you up as a kid,

965
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,881
these boys wanted to eat you.

966
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,481
They ain't never tasted Terran before.

967
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,369
I saved your life!

968
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,602
Oh, will you shut up about that? God!

969
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,081
Twenty years, you been
throwing that in my face,

970
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,891
like it's some great thing, not eating me.

971
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:55,521
Normal people don't even think
about eating someone else!

972
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,166
Much less that person
having to be grateful for it!

973
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,446
You abducted me, man.

974
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,721
You stole me from my home
and from my family.

975
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,008
You don't give a damn
about your Terra!

976
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,808
You're scared because
you're soft in here.

977
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:09,961
Here, right here!

978
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,321
Yondu!

979
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,720
Listen to me!

980
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,041
Ronan has something
called an Infinity Stone.

981
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,969
I know what he's got, girl.

982
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,447
Then you know we must get it back!

983
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,002
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

984
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,209
We have to warn them.
Billions of people will perish.

985
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,931
Is that what she's been
filling your head with, boy?

986
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,121
Sentiment?

987
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:33,323
Eating away your brain like maggots?!

988
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,491
That's it.

989
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,207
No!

990
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:42,761
Sorry, boy.

991
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:46,447
But a captain's gotta teach his men
what happens to those what cross him.

992
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,840
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

993
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,921
If you kill me now,

994
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:57,210
you are saying goodbye to
the biggest score you have ever seen.

995
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,771
The stone?

996
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,488
I hope you got something
better than that.

997
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,291
Because ain't nobody stealing
from Ronan.

998
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,811
We got a ringer.

999
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,371
Is that right?

1000
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,887
She knows everything
there is to know about Ronan.

1001
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,010
His ships, his army.

1002
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,003
He's vulnerable.

1003
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,131
Hey, what do you say, Yondu, huh?

1004
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,761
Me and you, taking down a mark
side-by-side, like the old days.

1005
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:36,561
Let him go!

1006
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,806
You always did have a scrote, boy!

1007
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,691
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.

1008
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,968
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.

1009
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,327
<i><font color="#80ffff">Attention, idiots.</i></font>

1010
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,200
<i><font color="#80ffff">The lunatic on top of this craft
is holding a Hadron Enforcer.</i></font>

1011
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,089
It's a weapon of my own design.

1012
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,366
What the hell?

1013
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,525
<i><font color="#80ffff">If you don't hand over
our companions now,</i></font>

1014
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,007
<i><font color="#80ffff">he's gonna tear your ship a new one.</i></font>

1015
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,924
<i><font color="#80ffff">A very big new one!</i></font>

1016
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,924
- I ain't buyin' it.
- I'm giving you to the count of five.

1017
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,609
- 5, 4, 3...
- No! Wait, hold on!

1018
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,524
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

1019
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,682
We figured it out! We're fine!

1020
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,441
<i><font color="#80ffff">Oh, hey, Quill.
What's going on?</i></font>

1021
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,604
You call that "figured it out"?

1022
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:31,001
We're gonna rob the guys
who just beat us senseless.

1023
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,640
Oh, you want to talk about senseless?

1024
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:35,001
How about trying to save us
by blowing us up?

1025
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,924
We were only gonna blow you up
if they didn't turn you over!

1026
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,809
And how on Earth
were they gonna turn us over

1027
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,521
when you only gave them
a count of five?

1028
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,961
We didn't have time
to work out the minutiae

1029
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:45,121
of the plan.

1030
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,521
This is what we get
for acting altruistically.

1031
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,682
- I am Groot.
- They are ungrateful.

1032
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:50,966
What's important now

1033
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,770
is we get the Ravagers' army

1034
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,126
to help us save Xandar.

1035
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,690
So we can give the stone to Yondu

1036
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,520
who's just gonna sell
to somebody even worse?

1037
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,201
We'll figure that part out later.

1038
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,964
We have to stop Ronan.

1039
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,485
How?

1040
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:03,721
I have a plan.

1041
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:04,801
You've got a plan?

1042
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,321
Yes.

1043
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:07,921
First of all, you're copying me from

1044
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,451
- when I said I had a plan.
- No, I'm not.

1045
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,524
People say that all the time.
It's not that unique of a thing to say.

1046
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,441
Secondly, I don't even
believe you have a plan.

1047
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,331
I have part of a plan!

1048
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,005
What percentage of a plan
do you have?

1049
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,571
You don't get to ask questions

1050
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,320
after the nonsense
you pulled on Knowhere.

1051
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,090
I just saved Quill.

1052
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,161
We've already established

1053
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,924
that you destroying the ship
that I'm on is not saving me.

1054
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,162
- When did we establish it?
- Like three seconds ago!

1055
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,845
I wasn't listening.
I was thinking of something else.

1056
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,520
She's right. You don't get an opinion.

1057
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,001
What percentage?

1058
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,525
I don't know. Twelve percent.

1059
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,965
Twelve percent?

1060
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,086
That's a fake laugh.

1061
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,009
- It's real!
- Totally fake.

1062
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:47,688
That is the most real, authentic,
hysterical laugh of my entire life

1063
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:48,921
because that is not a plan.

1064
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,451
It's barely a concept.

1065
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,601
You're taking their side?

1066
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:52,966
I am Groot.

1067
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,485
So what, it's better than 11%?

1068
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,085
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

1069
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,367
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

1070
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,327
See? Groot's the only one of you
who has a clue.

1071
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,361
Guys.

1072
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,281
Come on.

1073
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,488
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.

1074
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,040
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.

1075
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,363
I need your help.

1076
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,407
I look around at us.

1077
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:23,927
You know what I see?

1078
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:25,881
Losers.

1079
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:32,248
I mean, like, folks
who have lost stuff.

1080
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,482
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.

1081
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,931
Our homes,

1082
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,051
our families,

1083
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,083
normal lives.

1084
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,971
And, usually, life takes more
than it gives. But not today.

1085
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,325
Today, it's given us something.

1086
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,050
It has given us a chance.

1087
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,565
To do what?

1088
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,765
To give a shit.

1089
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,329
For once.

1090
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,522
Not run away.

1091
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,840
I, for one, am not gonna
stand by and watch

1092
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,003
as Ronan wipes out
billions of innocent lives.

1093
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,726
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,

1094
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,848
it's impossible.

1095
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,647
You're asking us to die.

1096
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,209
Yeah, I guess I am.

1097
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,166
Quill.

1098
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,682
I have lived most my life
surrounded by my enemies.

1099
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:54,930
I will be grateful
to die among my friends.

1100
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,163
You are an honorable man, Quill.

1101
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,087
I will fight beside you.

1102
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,805
And in the end,

1103
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,808
I will see my wife and daughter again.

1104
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,923
I am Groot.

1105
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:34,483
Oh, what the hell.
I don't have that long a lifespan, anyway.

1106
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,721
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

1107
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,362
We're all standing up now.

1108
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,808
Bunch of jackasses,
standing in a circle.

1109
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,565
The stone reacts
to anything organic.

1110
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:59,768
The bigger the target,
the bigger the power surge.

1111
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,003
All Ronan's got to do is touch the stone
to the planet's surface and zap.

1112
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,810
All plants, animals,

1113
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,680
- Nova Corps.
- Everything will die.

1114
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,048
So Ronan does not make the surface.

1115
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,968
<i><font color="#80ffff">Rocket will lead a team
to blow a hole</i></font>

1116
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:16,288
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.

1117
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:20,525
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

1118
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,410
Won't there be
hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?

1119
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:26,324
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

1120
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,640
Once they know we're on board,

1121
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:37,122
Ronan will isolate himself behind
impenetrable security doors on deck.

1122
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,646
<i><font color="#80ffff">Which I can disable
by dismantling the power source.</i></font>

1123
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,529
<i><font color="#80ffff">We'll make it to the flight deck,</i></font>

1124
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,604
<i><font color="#80ffff">and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer
to kill Ronan.</i></font>

1125
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:50,243
Once Ronan is dead,
we will retrieve the stone.

1126
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,842
Use these devices to contain it.

1127
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,611
If you touch it,

1128
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,691
it will kill you.

1129
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,443
<i><font color="#80ffff">I'll contact
one of the Nova officers</i></font>

1130

1131
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,681

we're there to help.</i></font>

1132
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,243
There's one more thing
we need to complete the plan.

1133
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,206
That guy's eye-

1134
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,646
No! No, we don't. No, we don't need

1135
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,131
that guy's eye-

1136
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,846
- no, seriously, I need it!
It's important to me.

1137
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,204
<i><font color="#80ffff">Ronan's fleet has been spotted,</i></font>

1138
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,406
<i><font color="#80ffff">and will arrive in T-minus</i></font>

1139
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,164
<i><font color="#80ffff">fifteen minutes.</i></font>

1140
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:31,050
Remember, boy.

1141
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:34,806
At the end of all this,
I get the stone.

1142
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,406
You cross me, we kill you all.

1143
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,371
Let's go get 'em, boys!

1144
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,120
This is a terrible plan.

1145
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,720
Hey, you're the one who said
you wanted to die among friends.

1146
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:20,481
Nova Prime.

1147
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,246
I received a transmission

1148
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,640
from one of the Ravagers.

1149
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,841
He says Ronan's in possession of
something called an Infinity Stone

1150
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:29,325
and he's headed toward Xandar.

1151
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,606
Good God.

1152
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,683
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

1153
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,326
Did he say
why we should believe him?

1154
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,562
He said his crew
just escaped from prison

1155
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,730
so he'd have no other reason
to risk coming to Xandar to help.

1156
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,721
He says that he's an

1157
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:44,807
"a-hole."

1158
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,289
But he's not, and I'm
quoting him, here,

1159
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,607
"100% a dick."

1160
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,046
Do you believe him?

1161
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:55,803
I don't know that I believe anyone
is 100% a dick, ma'am.

1162
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,804
I mean, do you believe
that he is here to help?

1163
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,521
Yeah.

1164
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,090
A fleet approaches.

1165
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,124
They appear to be Ravagers.

1166
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,281
Fire!

1167
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,801
<i><font color="#80ffff">Cover it down.</i></font>

1168
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,883
Submerge!

1169
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,046
Rocket, hurry!

1170
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,766
All pilots, dive!

1171
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,081
<i><font color="#80ffff">They're beneath us!</i></font>

1172
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,331
Evacuate the city.

1173
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:20,962
Our priority is to get our people
away from the battle.

1174
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,001
Forward thrust, now!

1175
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:43,521
Come on!

1176
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,844
Quill! Yondu! Now!

1177
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,650
Aw, hell!

1178
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,245
I'm going down, Quill!

1179
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,164
No more games with me, boy!

1180
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,367
I'll see you

1181
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,249
<i><font color="#80ffff">at the end of this!</i></font>

1182
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,965
There are too many of them, Rocket!

1183
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,449
We'll never make it up there!

1184
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,606
<i><font color="#80ffff">Peter Quill.</i></font>

1185
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,161
This is Denarian Saal
of the Nova Corps.

1186
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,608
For the record,
I advised against trusting you here.

1187
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,125
They got my "dick" message!

1188
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,721
Prove me wrong.

1189
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,089
Yes!

1190
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:24,361
Yes!

1191
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,569
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

1192
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,205
The starboard kern has been breached!

1193
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,691
We have been boarded.

1194
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,171
Continue our approach.

1195
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,606
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

1196
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,411
None of that will matter
once we reach the surface.

1197
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,521
Seal security doors!

1198
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,807
Now!

1199
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,807
Get out of my way!

1200
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,565
Oh, man.

1201
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:06,089
All Nova pilots,
interlock and form a blockade.

1202
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:10,126
<i><font color="#80ffff">The Dark Aster
must not reach the ground.</i></font>

1203
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:23,846
Locked in!

1204
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,846
Locked in.

1205
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,401
We're locked in.

1206
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,887
I can barely see.

1207
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,969
When did you learn to do that?

1208
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:40,364
Pretty sure the answer
is "I am Groot."

1209
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,046
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.

1210
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:50,648
I want you all to know that I am grateful
for your acceptance after my blunders.

1211
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,407
It is pleasing to once again have

1212
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,041
friends.

1213
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:59,010
You, Quill, are my friend.

1214
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:00,286
Thanks.

1215
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:03,211
- This dumb tree, he is my friend.
- Mmm.

1216
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:05,926
And this green whore, she, too...

1217
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,565
Oh, you must stop!

1218
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:13,205
Gamora, look at what you have done.

1219
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,888
You have always been weak.

1220
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,288
You stupid, traitorous...

1221
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,761
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

1222
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,001
Head to the flight deck.

1223
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:30,811
I'll shut down the power
to the security doors.

1224
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,609
Yondu Udonta.

1225
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:44,242
Order your men
to turn on the Nova Corps.

1226
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,565
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

1227
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,529
Time to die...

1228
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,287
Nebula, please.

1229
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,531
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,

1230
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:57,768
enact immolation initiative.

1231
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,805
They're dive-bombing the city!

1232
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,689
Denarian Saal,
should we break formation?

1233
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,490
No! Hold your positions.

1234
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:39,531
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

1235
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:41,324
<i><font color="#80ffff">We'll take care of the people
down here.</i></font>

1236
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,607
I can't believe
I'm taking orders from a hamster.

1237
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,040
Star-Lord.

1238
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:49,521
Finally.

1239
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:56,286
Ah!

1240
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:01,487
You thief!

1241
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,204
You will never make it to Ronan.

1242
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:24,201
Everybody shoot them
before they hit the ground.

1243

Come on!

1244
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:20,522
Finger to the throat means death.

1245
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,771
Metaphor.

1246
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,206
Yeah, sorta.

1247
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:30,521
Oh, no.

Xandar!

1249
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:03,251

Sister, help us fight Ronan.

You know he's crazy.

Get out!

1266
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:38,081
You did it!

1267
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:05,931
I was mistaken.

1268

I do remember your family.

No, Groot!

1272
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:12,206
You can't.

1273
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:13,770
You'll die.

1274
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,163
Why are you doing this?

1275
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,810
Why'?

1276
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,970
We

1277
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:27,441
are

1278
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:29,565
Groot.

1279
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:36,008
I called him an idiot.

1280
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,643
You killed Groot!

1281
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,131
Behold!

1282
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,482
Your 'guardians of the galaxy.'

1283
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:13,040
What fruit have they wrought?

1284
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:17,250
Only that my father and his father

1285
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:20,881
shall finally know vengeance.

1286
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,281
People of Xandar,

1287
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:28,650
the time has come to
rejoice and renounce

1288
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:31,007
your paltry gods!

1289
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:35,162
Your salvation is at hand.

1290
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,445
Listen to these words.

1291
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,204
Now bring it down hard!

1292
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:04,681
What are you doing?

1293
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:07,771
Dance-off, bro!
Me and you!

1294
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,611
Gamora.

1295
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:15,688
Subtle. Take it back.

1296
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:18,361
What are you doing?

1297
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:21,001
I'm distracting you,
you big turd blossom.

1298
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:38,730
No!

1299
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:15,849
Peter! Take my hand!

1300
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:23,282
Take my hand, Peter.

1301
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:25,611
Mom.

1302
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:28,168
<i><font color="#80ffff">Take my hand!</i></font>

1303
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:24,568
You're mortal!

1304
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:26,006
How?

1305
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:28,401
You said it yourself, bitch.

1306
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,847
We're the 'Guardians of the Galaxy.'

1307
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:01,926
Well, well, well.

1308
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:03,561
Quite the light show.

1309
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,524
Ain't this sweet.

1310
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,566
But you got some business to attend to

1311
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:14,166
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

1312
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:18,047
Peter, you can't. Peter.

1313
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:20,248
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu.

1314
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:22,324
I don't know who you're selling this to,

1315
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:24,323
but the only way
the universe can survive

1316
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,164
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.

1317
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,162
I may be as pretty as an angel,

1318
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:33,289
but I sure as hell ain't one.

1319
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,490
Hand it over, son.

1320
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:54,361
Yondu.

1321
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:00,728
Do not open that orb.
You know that, right?

1322
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:03,806
You've seen what it does to people.

1323
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,801
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

1324
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:20,286
It's probably good
we didn't deliver him to his dad

1325
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:21,401
like we was hired to do.

1326
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,251
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

1327
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:32,681
He is gonna be so pissed when he
realizes I switched out the orb on him.

1328
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:37,283
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

1329
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,164
Oh, I know.

1330
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:43,644
But he was about the only family I had.

1331
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:47,607
No.

1332
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,086
He wasn't.

1333
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:39,720
<i><font color="#80ffff">Why would you
even know this?</i></font>

1334
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,765
When we arrested you, we noticed
an anomaly in your nervous system,

1335
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:44,205
so we had it checked out.

1336
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:47,164
I'm not Terran?

1337
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:48,845
You are half Terran.

1338
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,641
Your mother was of Earth.
Your father, well,

1339
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:56,361
he's something very ancient
we've never seen here before.

1340
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:57,920
That could be why you were able

1341
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,241
to hold the stone for as long as you did.

1342
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:02,480
Your friends have arrived.

1343
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:06,321
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

1344
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:09,326
we'd like to express
our profound gratitude

1345
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:11,889
for your help in saving Xandar.

1346
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:16,411
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

1347
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:18,164
he has something to show you.

1348
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,084
Thank you, Nova Prime.

1349
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:33,163
Your wife and child shall rest well
knowing that you have avenged them.

1350
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:34,841
Yes.

1351
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,923
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

1352
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:39,842
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

1353
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:45,285
We tried to keep it as close
to the original as possible.

1354
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:47,848
We salvaged as much as we could.

1355
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:50,286
Wow.

1356
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:51,961
I...

1357
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:55,086
Thank you.

1358
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,284
I have a family.

1359
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,290
They're alive because of you.

1360
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:07,327
Your criminal records
have also been expunged.

1361
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:11,485
However, I have to warn you against
breaking any laws in the future.

1362
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,081
Question.

1363
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:14,401
What if I see something
that I want to take,

1364
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:15,811
and it belongs to someone else?

1365
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,166
You will be arrested.

1366
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:19,481
But what if I want it more
than the person who has it?

1367
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:21,962
- It's still illegal.
- That doesn't follow.

1368
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:23,167
No, I want it more, sir.
Do you understand?

1369
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:24,926
What are you laughing at?

1370
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,565
Why? I can't have a discussion
with this gentleman?

1371
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:28,483
What if someone
does something irksome

1372
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:30,802
and I decide to remove his spine?

1373
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:33,481
That's...

1374
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:36,841
That's actually murder.

1375
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:41,171
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

1376
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:44,164
So... also illegal.

1377
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,007
Hmm.

1378
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:48,807
They'll be fine, Dey.

1379
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:50,681
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

1380
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:51,841
You?

1381
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:58,250
Yeah. Me.

Something bad?

A bit of both?

We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.

1396

Bit of both.

1397
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:28,801
What do you let it
lick you like that for?

1398
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:31,685
