The next time you feel like going out,

312
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,791
don't lie to me.

313
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,583
You'll take me with you
to party until the sun rises.

314
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,125
- Or until it sets again.
- Sure.

315
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,125
Fuck, can't you knock?
What the hell's wrong with you?

316
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,750
Someone stole the gold.

317
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,708
What?

318
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,833
Absolutely not a word about this.

319
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,125
If anyone finds out,
it's over, we're dead.

320
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,625
Son of a bitch.

321
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,666
Come on, let's go! Quick!

322
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,875
[tense action music playing]

323
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,583
Let's go.

324
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,958
[Rio] Shakir,
I just got access to the server.

325
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,375
I'm in, Professor.
We have the traffic cameras.

326
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,750
All right, check the ones on the M60.

327
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,458
<i>They must have taken
the exit at kilometer 26.</i>

328
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,541
Here it is. Exit 26, Madrid-Barcelona.

329
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:18,708
We're looking for three dump trucks,
maybe four, between 10:55 and 11:10.

330
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,291
[Rio] <i>I don't see
any dump trucks taking that exit.</i>

331
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,250
[Professor] <i>Look for
any heavy goods vehicle.</i>

332
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,000
Nothing, Professor.

333
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,708
There's nothing here,
not in those 15 minutes, or the next 15.

334
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,208
They took a local road.
There's no cameras on those.

335
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,750
<i>Any idiot knows that.</i>

336
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,393
- Then there's no way we can find them.
- No, we still have time.

337
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,166
All we can do
is take care of the people outside.

338
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,083
Cincinnati, my daughter, and my mom.

339
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,083
I won't give up now.
I won't throw in the towel.

340
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,625
You already did.
When you put your hands down.

341
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:47,000
You had weapons, men,
a strong position, and you surrendered.

342
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,125
It was a lost battle.

343
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,625
<i>They came in with patrol cars,</i>

344
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,541
special operation vans.
It looked like an advanced party.

345
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,750
Killing 20 police officers
wouldn't have saved us.

346
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,291
They weren't police officers!

347
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,708
It was a fucking illusionist's act,
and you fell for it.

348
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,250
You fell for the same tricks,
the same illusions that you use!

349
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,500
[shouting] Shut up!

350
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,666
[Victoria wailing]

351
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,083
Wait a minute.

352
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,958
<i>It's like Palermo said.</i>

353
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,000
This is the son of Berlin.

354
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:32,625
They're playing the same cards we are.

355
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:34,666
Lisbon was right.

356
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,625
Of course it's an act of illusionism.

357
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,767
<i>It was the case when they stole our gold.
And that's still the case right now.</i>

358
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:44,250
They knew we would check
the security cameras.

359
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,833
It was the only thing we could do.

360
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,375
And that we would believe what we saw.

361
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:53,041
But maybe what we're seeing isn't real.

362
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,041
Rio, check those videos again.

363
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,541
<i>Look for something, a loop,</i>

364
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,083
whatever, for any signs that those videos
may have been tampered with.

365
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,625
The asphalt. It's wet.
It didn't rain today, that's yesterday.

366
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,500
They altered the video even though
they could've went on a local road

367
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:10,958
<i>that doesn't have any cameras.</i>

368
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,721
Why would they go through
all that trouble?

369
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,958
Because they need to.

370
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,041
Exactly.

371
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:19,041
They're going somewhere
they can only get to on this road.

372
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,916
The M60 is a ring road.
They'd never use it to get out of Madrid.

373
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,500
Because they're not running away.

374
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,333
That means they're hiding.

375
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,541
No one's gonna leave the country
with 90 tons of gold.

376
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,416
What do you do when you have
so much money and so much gold

377
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,780
that you can't take it with you?

378
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,433
- What did Pablo Escobar do?
- [laughing]

379
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,166
- What did pirates do?
- They bury it!

380
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,000
That's why they're using dump trucks.

381
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,916
- That's right.
- The gold is underground.

382
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,916
- Correct!
- Where do you bury that kind of treasure?

383
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,750
Wherever it is, they're burying it.

384
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,583
The hole you need to make
to bury 90 tons of gold

385
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:53,833
requires you to move around
so much earth and so much machinery...

386
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:58,541
that we might still have
a chance of finding it.

387
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,375
- [beeping]
- Okay, higher.

388
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,166
Higher, higher.

389
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,083
[classical music playing]

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,458
[both laughing]

391
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:24,666
Attention!

392
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:28,791
I want everyone dressed
as anything but a soldier.

393
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:32,125
A doctor, a civil safety officer,
ambulance driver, whatever.

394
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:34,416
We're going in when they least expect it.

395
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,500
We'll approach the bank under camouflage,
we'll gather troops in the blind spots,

396
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:41,583
and then we'll wait
for a signal from Sergeant Arteche.

397
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,416
- Is that clear?
- [troops] <i>Sí, señor!</i>

00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:55,250
I'm almost at the library.

401
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,458
I'm about to establish contact
with Major Sagasta.

402
00:25:58,541 --> 00:25:59,541
Copy that, Sergeant.

403

[Tamayo] <i>All units get in position.</i>

[Arteche] <i>I've made
visual contact with Sagasta.</i>

409
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:48,833
Mendizábal, status?

410
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:51,541
- We're now in position, Colonel.
- [Tamayo] <i>Copy that.</i>

411
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,708
We're moving!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

412
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:55,791
Suárez, get ready.

Standing by at the blind spot.

414
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,916
- Cañizo?
- Colonel, our unit is set.

415
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,625
Sergeant, all units are ready
and awaiting your signal.

Keep your eyes on the ground!

There's nothing to see here.

[Tamayo] <i>Arteche.</i>

Arteche, what's going on?

00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:30,434
- [Arteche] Another robber just came in.
- [Palermo] Put your heads down.

[Arteche] <i>Stand by.</i>

How's that leg feeling?

Good. I still don't feel anything.

The hostages giving you trouble?

426
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:41,666
No.

427
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,500
They've been quiet.

428
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,791
I came to tell you something.

This kind of sounds like a goodbye.

The Professor lost the gold,
and I really doubt we'll get out of here.

00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,583
Palermo, you'll get me out of here.

433

You promised.

434
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,125
And you'll do it.

435
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:06,958
Maybe you doubt it,

Listen to me. It's not epilepsy, okay?
It might be brain damage.

Possibly a subdural hematoma.
