1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,086
-STUDENT 1: That was Park Wonseok, right?
-STUDENT 2: You mean in the video?

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,462
STUDENT 1: Does that mean he was killed
and that he didn't kill himself?

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,089
-STUDENT 3: Right.
-STUDENT 1: Who did that?

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,799
I could've sworn I saw
somebody kicking him out of the window.

5
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,342
I don't feel safe in this school anymore.

6
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,263
(suspenseful music)

7
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,029
Seok Jaebum?

8
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,822
(breathes awkwardly)

9
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,323
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,159
Uh, I...

11
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,246
Actually, I...

12
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:39,664
Seok Jaebum, was it you?

13
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,332
Are you the one who left the note for me?

14
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,417
Note?

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,880
Oh, right. You're here
because you received a note too, right?

16
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,506
-Uh...
-(door closes)

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,342
(ominous music)

18
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,770
(panting)

19
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,188
(sighs in disappointment)

20
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,149
-(panting)
-Agh, we should have caught him!

21
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,650
That was probably the guy
who left the note, don't you think?

22
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,403
(pants)
Definitely. Seriously, who is that guy?

23
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,197
Do you think he would've shown himself
to me if you hadn't been there?

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,617
-(panting continues)
-Ah, sorry, that might've been the case.

25
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,285
Sorry, I ruined it for you.

26
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,369
-Oh, no, no, it's fine.
-(both pant)

27
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,580
I was in the athletic field,
ditching class,

28
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,290
when I saw you heading
into the shooting range alone.

29
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,000
That reminded me
of the auditorium incident

30
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,002
when you got attacked,
so I followed you in.

31
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,462
I guess I should thank you.

32
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,547
(breathes deeply)
Do you think

33
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,299
that's the same guy
from the auditorium incident?

34
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,842
(exhales deeply)
Maybe it's someone else?

35
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,220
Why do you say that?

36
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:36,763
Huh?

37
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,891
Oh, it's just...

38
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,643
It's just a hunch that I'm having.

39
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,394
(panting)

40
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,480
(suspicious music)

41
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,277
SOUNDS FROM YOUR HEART

42
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,613
-(sighs)
-(door closes)

43
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,954
Ok Chanmi.

44
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,539
I'd like to apologize.

45
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,876
I should've investigated this
as a homicide case from the beginning.

46
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,628
I'm sorry it took us so long
to come around.

47
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,296
You need to find the cell phone.

48
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,715
My older brother's cell phone.

49
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,717
We'll look into it.

50
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,344
In the meantime, do you know of anyone

51
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,054
who might've been on bad terms
with your older brother?

52
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,305
No.

53
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,307
You transferred to this school
on purpose all the way from Busan.

54
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,268
Is there anything
you've managed to piece together so far?

55
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,103
Are you...

56
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,731
asking me if I know
who the perpetrator is?

57
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,359
Now? Three months after he was killed?

58
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,610
Now, after all the evidence
has disappeared and the murderer's

59
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,487
had plenty of time
to hide whatever's remaining?

60
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,656
I understand you're feeling frustrated
as a family member of the victim.

61
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,992
But your attitude is not going to help
this investigation. Wouldn't you agree?

62
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,743
I mean, what I'm asking is...

63
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,453
Chanmi.

64
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,456
You said you noticed someone
coming towards your brother

65
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,458
when you were on that video call
with him, correct?

66
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,253
Yes, I did.

67
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,212
<i>Hey, hold on a second.</i>

68
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,715
CHANMI: <i>We stopped talking
because someone came towards my brother.</i>

69
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,884
<i>It seemed like the phone fell
to the ground.</i>

70
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:56,801
Huh? What the...

71
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,179
Then someone picked up the phone.

72
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,763
I couldn't see their face.

73
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,016
It's exactly the same
as what I told you three months ago.

74
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,100
(sighs)

75
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,102
Do you remember your brother's expression

76
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,979
when that person approached him?

77
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,733
Did he seem happy to see them,
or did he not seem to like them?

78
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,822
I didn't really notice anything
in particular.

79
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,115
(sighs lightly)

80
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,286
I called you in here today

81
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,580
mainly because I wanted to apologize.

82
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,167
Um, if you think of anything that
might be useful for the investigation,

83
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,585
feel free to reach out anytime.

84
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,420
If there's nothing else,
you're free to go.

85
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,255
May I also ask you a question?

86
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,759
The video of my brother falling,

87
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,178
the one that everyone saw
in the auditorium...

88
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,015
Why do you think they chose
to release it now and in this way?

89
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,769
If they had submitted that video
to the police from the beginning,

90
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,812
this case would have been investigated
as a homicide, right?

91
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,565
That's a mystery to us too.

92
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,817
You know that we can't share
any technical details with you, right?

93
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,444
Where was that video taken?

94
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,654
Chanmi,

95
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,530
I want to make this very clear to you.

96
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,282
We will investigate this case
as the police.

97
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,869
Please don't think about investigating
this case on your own.

98
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,708
What's up with you?
Ditching class and all.

99
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,170
We could just talk in the classroom.
Why did you text me to come out?

100
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,672
Osung.

101
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,258
Answer me truthfully.

102
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,552
What's going on?

103
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,013
Did you send Chanmi another note?

104
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,431
No.

105
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,433
You didn't?

106
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,560
I already got what I needed from her
in the auditorium that last time.

107
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,062
What else would I need from her?

108
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,439
I didn't send her another note.

109
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:34,857
Really?

110
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,401
Why do you ask?

111
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,443
Did something happen?

112
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,529
It's nothing.

113
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,863
If you didn't do it, it's fine.

114
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,574
Why are you paying

115
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,951
so much attention to her?

116
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,079
Chanmi's my shooting coach after all.

117
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,596
(keyboard clatters)

118
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,474
Hello, Mr. Jo.

119
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,769
Oh! Our dear Ajung!
You're finally back at school.

120
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,938
-How have you been?
-Oh, good, good.

121
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,607
Ajung, how is everything going
with your debut?

122
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,944
-It's going pretty well, thanks to you.
-If you become a superstar one day...

123
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,697
-(laughs)
-...don't forget about me.

124
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,242
Oh, of course!
How could I ever forget about you, Mr. Jo?

125
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,702
(laughs)
Good, good. You should head to class.

126
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,870
I'll be on my way then.

127
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:29,954
Hey, Ajung.

128
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,457
You already know which class
you'll be joining, right?

129
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,792
-Yes, I do.
-(laughs)

130
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,044
-Head on up then.
-Yes.

131
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,628
(laughs)
Aw.

132
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,089
She's finally back at school. My oh my.

133
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,051
-(indistinct chatter in distance)
-Oh.

134
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,012
-What did Mr. Jo say to you?
-(scoffs)

135
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,265
"Ajung, don't forget about me
if you become a superstar one day."

136
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,850
-(retches)
-(laughs)

137
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,185
Pft, what the heck?

138
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,103
(laughs)

139
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,189
(gagging)

140
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,569
What the...

141
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,695
Hey, Ajung!

142
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,781
(retching)

143
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,200
(coughs)

144
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,451
-Are you vomiting for real?
-(coughs)

145
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,369
(groans)

146
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,412
-Ah...
-(coughs)

147
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,122
-Hey, are you vomiting for real?
-(groans)

148
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,791
Wow, this is crazy.

149
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,750
(retching)

150
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,877
I can't believe you're so disgusted by him
that you're actually vomiting.

151
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,795
(sighs)

152
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,421
(Ajung groans)

153
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,592
I was in the same class
as Wonseok last year.

154
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,011
Do you know who might've been
on bad terms with him?

155
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,805
I'm not sure.

156
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,766
Several students told us
that it might've been you.

157
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,060
That's not true.

158
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,187
I wasn't on bad terms with him.

159
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,689
Didn't you guys get into a bloody fight
first semester of last year?

160
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,400
Everyone seemed to know
since it was a big fight.

161
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,443
Yes, we did fight once.

162
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,529
But just because we had a fight
doesn't mean I killed him.

163
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,780
Why did you two fight?

164
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,532
It was early in the first semester
of junior year.

165
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,118
Park Wonseok came to me
and challenged me to fight him.

166
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,078
So I did.

167
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,415
You're the one
who first reported his death.

168
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,292
Why were you in the science lab building

169
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,337
while everyone else was gathered
at the recording studio in the auditorium?

170
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,714
I told the police
all about that last time.

171
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,174
(scoffs)
I'm sorry.

172
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,177
I transferred here
after the incident occurred.

173
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,304
There's a stray cat that I feed every day.

174
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,724
And that day, I was opening a can
of cat food for her behind that building

175
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,601
when I heard something fall...

176
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,770
Oh, right. That cat.

177
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,189
So after hearing the thud,
you went over there,

178
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,358
and Park Wonseok was already lying there.

179
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,484
Yes.

180
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,403
Was there anyone else nearby?

181
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,030
I don't think so.

182
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,490
I didn't see anyone.

183
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,660
Who do you think
was Park Wonseok's best friend?

184
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,248
I believe it was Gi Osung.

185
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,092
Oh, come have a seat.

186
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,218
(clears throat)

187
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,261
(inhales deeply)

188
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,183
So, were there any human rights violation

189
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,518
or anything of the sort
during the police investigation?

190
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,895
No, not at all.

191
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:00,855
Good.

192
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,064
Stay focused on your studies

193
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,900
even though things
are chaotic here at school.

194
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,401
Yes, Mr. Gu.

195
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,945
Oh, also, why haven't you come by
for academic counseling?

196
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,697
Everyone else has already stopped by!

197
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,032
Oh, I...

198
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,868
Hey. Where do you think
you'll be a year from now?

199
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,663
A college campus,
or a remedial boarding school?

200
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,042
Back in the day, we studied all night
and didn't even go home.

201
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,251
SOOHEON: <i>Where will I be...</i>

202
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,129
<i>a year from now?</i>

203
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:36,599
NEUNGHWA LIVING FACILITIES

204
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,850
(grunts)

205
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,063
How are your studies going?

206
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,272
(laughs)

207
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,150
(inhales deeply)
Mom, whenever I come see you,

208
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,195
why don't you have anything else
to ask me about other than my studies?

209
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,572
Of course. You're a high school senior.

210
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,950
(both chuckle)

211
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,538
Mom, when do you think
you were the happiest?

212
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,373
(inhales deeply)

213
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,749
(sighs)

214
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,502
Hmm, let's see, when was I the happiest...

215
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,837
(inhales deeply)

216
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,383
Maybe it was when you started kindergarten

217
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,262
and your older brother
started elementary school.

218
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,389
What did you like best about that time?

219
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,890
The two of you.

220
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,101
Whenever I looked at the two of you...
(inhales deeply)

221
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,270
...it always pulled at my heartstrings.

222
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,187
(laughs)

223
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,649
Because my kids were starting
new chapters in their lives.

224
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,111
Starting kindergarten
and starting elementary school.

225
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,282
Is raising a child all about

226
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,450
seeing them grow up,

227
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,869
seeing what they end up doing,

228
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,123
and seeing that process repeat
over and over?

229
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,374
Exactly.

230
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,002
My son, you're so smart.
(scoffs)

231
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,379
-(whimpers)
-Mom.

232
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,381
Come on,
why are you being like that again?

233
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,134
It's nothing.
(sobs)

234
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,553
It's nothing.
(inhales deeply)

235
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,054
Sooheon.

236
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,141
As your mom...
(sobs)

237
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,892
...I'm frustrated and heartbroken

238
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,604
that we've ended up like this, but...

239
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,440
as long as you're doing okay, Sooheon,

240
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,775
I'll be fine with it.

241
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,819
No matter what,

242
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,279
I just want you to be happy.

243
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,447
(whimpers)

244
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,906
Do you understand what I mean,

245
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,992
my son?

246
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,452
Don't worry, Mom.

247
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,998
I'm going to be happy.

248
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,083
(sobs)

249
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,210
I'm sorry.

250
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,297
Mom, why are you crying?

251
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,176
-Stop with the tears now, huh?
-(inhales deeply)

252
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,344
I'm fine.

253
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,595
(exhales deeply)

254
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,015
(dramatic music)

255
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,146
(light music)

256
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:04,997
REVENGE OF OTHERS

257
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,672
(motorcycle engine rumbles in distance)

258
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,845
Sooheon!

259
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,431
Sooheon! Hey!

260
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,858
MMA, KICKBOXING, JIUJITSU,
MUY THAI, LOSING WEIGHT

261
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,318
Here.
(gasps)

262
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,364
Oh.

263
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,742
I just occurred to me
that I should thank you somehow.

264
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,661
You let me stay on the rooftop

265
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,870
even though
it might be inconvenient for you.

266
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:45,871
(laughs lightly)

267
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,707
Anyway, for a lot of things, okay?

268
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,418
Drink this. Drink it up.

269
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,128
-Oh, should I open it for you?
-Chanmi.

270
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,547
-What is it you want to say?
-Huh?

271
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,843
It's about my brother.

272
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,471
I received a message
from my brother's adopted family.

273
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,850
They said I can come by
to pick up his things if I want to.

274
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,310
They haven't given you
any of his stuff until now?

275
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,813
I think they're feeling much better now
that they know his death wasn't a suicide.

276
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,523
What do you mean?

277
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,066
(scoffs)
I don't really understand it either.

278
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,488
So... what I wanted to ask you was...

279
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,657
Do you think you could come with me

280
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,659
when I go over there
to pick up his things?

281
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,994
(sighs)

282
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,788
I just don't feel like
I can go there alone.

283
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,665
(tongue clicks)
Okay.

284
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,292
I'll go with you.

285
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,710
Thanks.

286
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,503
No problem.

287
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,591
You want to go now?

288
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,051
Yeah, now.

289
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,220
(door beeps)

290
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,189
(both sigh)

291
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,358
We were very surprised to learn
that someone had killed him.

292
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,068
We're even being investigated.

293
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,112
Well, at least now

294
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,698
we know he didn't commit
the grave sin of committing suicide.

295
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,159
So, Wonseok's soul
will be saved after all.

296
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,118
Amen.

297
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,412
By the way,

298
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,999
how did you know from the beginning
that he didn't commit suicide?

299
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,709
They're twins.

300
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,836
Don't twins have some sort of
spiritual connection or something?

301
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,047
Anyways, I'm just relieved
that it wasn't a suicide.

302
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:20,925
Is this his stuff?

303
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,971
We already took care of his clothes,
shoes, books, et cetera.

304
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,723
So this is the only thing that's left.

305
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,393
But it's locked,
so we have no idea what's inside.

306
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,438
It made us feel uneasy.
Not being able to get rid of it.

307
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,397
(sighs)

308
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,233
Now that it's in the hands
of his younger sister, it's all good.

309
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,401
I'll be off then.

310
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,281
You guys were the ones who killed Wonseok.

311
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,661
What? You're relieved
that it wasn't a suicide?

312
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,413
How could anyone stand to live
with a family like this?

313
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,582
-He must've already been dead inside.
-(gasps)

314
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,043
How could you
even call yourselves parents?

315
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,963
-Your child died!
-My god.

316
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,882
-How dare you, you little punk!
-Just stop, Sooheon. Let's go.

317
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,844
Shouldn't you be eager to find out
who killed your own child?

318
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,848
Shouldn't you want to see the face
of the person who killed your own child?

319
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,184
Even his younger sister is going through
all kinds of trouble to find the murderer!

320
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,978
Seriously, how can
you call yourselves parents?

321
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,062
Huh?!

322
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,272
Sooheon!

323
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,898
(breathes deeply)

324
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,441
Let's just leave.

325
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,569
Please.

326
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,279
(continues breathing deeply)

327
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,285
(dramatic music)

328
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,224
Do you know the passcode?

329
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,979
Should I bring some tools?

330
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,898
If it's not the passcode
that I think it is,

331
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,399
then let's break it open.

332
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,942
In that case, I'll bring the tools anyway.

333
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,986
My brother and I...

334
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,364
were abandoned on April Fool's Day.

335
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,909
During the Cherry Blossom Festival
at Jinhae.

336
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,454
We had always hoped that

337
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,917
what had happened to us
was just an April Fool's Day joke.

338
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,463
So the password my brother and I
always used was...

339
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,049
(inhales deeply)
0401.

340
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,303
Since this passcode is only 3 digits...

341
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,805
(breathes lightly)

342
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,524
(grunts)

343
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,072
-It worked!
-(soft chuckle)

344
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,620
(sighs lightly)

345
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,999
Wow.

346
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,462
(chuckles lightly)

347
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,922
(laughs lightly)

348
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,928
He won this when he was in middle school.

349
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,262
(laughs)

350
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,014
Wow.

351
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,020
We took this when we were
at the orphanage.

352
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,355
(laughs)

353
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,357
(soft laugh)

354
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,488
And this is the pistol I gave him.

355
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,572
(inhales deeply)

356
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,573
(gasps)

357
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,327
These I bought every time I saw a star.

358
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,371
I gave these to him for his birthday.

359
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,791
It was his dream to study
in a military academy

360
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,001
and become a general one day.

361
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,378
Huh?

362
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,587
(clatters)

363
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,424
And this is...

364
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,802
evidence that he had secretly
been drinking alone?

365
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,387
But why whiskey?

366
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,264
I heard it's easier to buy
a bottle of whiskey

367
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,890
than it is to buy a bottle of soju.

368
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,475
You can always pretend
you're buying it as a gift.

369
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,269
Oh...

370
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,198
Sooheon.

371
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,075
Have you ever drunk before?

372
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,744
I know you probably won't believe me,

373
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,704
but no.

374
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,873
Believe it or not,
I've never had it before either.

375
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,458
(laughs lightly)
Do you...

376
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,377
want to drink this together?

377
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,505
Cheers!

378
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,802
(sniffs)

379
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,181
(both slurp)

380
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,517
-(coughs)
-(groans)

381
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,562
(groans, coughs)

382
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,147
(inhales deeply, laughs)

383
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,815
(exhales quickly, sniffs)

384
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,817
-Here, let me pour you another round.
-Again?

385
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,321
(both slurp)

386
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,699
(both cough)

387
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,910
(inhales deeply)
Ah, my brother was a real punk.

388
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,203
(coughs, sniffs)

389
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,788
A high schooler secretly drinking whiskey.

390
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,039
He must've been going through a lot.

391
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,124
If people drank
every time things got tough for them,

392
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,335
every teenager in Korea
would be an alcoholic.

393
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,504
He must've been struggling.

394
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,631
You don't have to comfort me.

395
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:15,427
I already know he was a terrible person
and had a bad reputation as well.

396
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,012
I liked Wonseok though.

397
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,139
He was loyal

398
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,933
and manly.

399
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,518
(laughs)
Stop.

400
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,728
I don't need you to make me feel better.

401
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,026
SOOHEON: <i>It just makes me wonder...</i>

402
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,906
<i>Is that about all
that's left of someone after death?</i>

403
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,282
(sighs)

404
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,412
What do you think

405
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,541
you'll be doing a year from now?

406
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,668
If nothing special happens to me,

407
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,629
I think I'll be a soldier by then.

408
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,339
A soldier? Just like Wonseok wanted?

409
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,133
Yeah.

410
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,346
(breathes awkwardly)

411
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,224
I heard that being a parent is all about

412
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,561
seeing your child grow up,

413
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,230
then seeing what they end up doing,

414
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,860
and seeing what they do after that.

415
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,616
(breathes shakily)

416
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,411
(tongue clicks)
I'm gonna go to the restroom real quick.

417
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,204
(sniffs)

418
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,970
(Sooheon sobbing, sniffs)

419
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,055
(dramatic music)

420
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,064
(sniffs)

421
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,651
(sobbing continues)

422
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,696
(sniffs)

423
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,291
(sniffles)

424
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,545
(dramatic music continues)

425
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,134
(sobbing)

426
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,522
(sniffs)

427
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,526
(sobbing continues)

428
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,998
(yawns)

429
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,846
You should get to school earlier.

430
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,391
And don't drink anymore.

431
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,685
It sucks to see someone cry
when they're drunk.

432
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,229
What's with you? That's the first thing
you say when you see me?

433
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,189
It seems Hong Ajung is back at school.

434
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,649
Can you tell her I want to see her?

435
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,500
I heard you and Park Wonseok were close.

436
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,377
And that you were
in some shooting club together.

437
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,672
But you do realize
your story lacks credibility, right?

438
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,090
What do you mean?

439
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,759
He told you I was his girlfriend?

440
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,761
When you were living all the way in Busan?

441
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,638
Yeah, um...

442
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,057
That's not true.
I wasn't his girlfriend.

443
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,267
What?

444
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,936
What do you mean?

445
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,398
How could I be his girlfriend
when we've never even kissed?

446
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,525
We were never together.

447
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,068
I have a real boyfriend.

448
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,946
That's why I'm telling you
that your story lacks credibility.

449
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,073
Wonseok lied his ass off to you.

450
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:07,909
Hold on.

451
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,079
Then, what's this?

452
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,915
Wow, he must've really tried his best
to fool you even showing you this.

453
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,377
I asked him for a favor one day.

454
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,421
I said, "Will you be my fake boyfriend?"

455
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,131
When I asked him, he said, "Okay!"

456
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,468
Well, I needed a fake boyfriend back then.

457
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,429
As you already know,
I was going to join a talent agency.

458
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:32,434
So in any case, Wonseok pretended to be
my boyfriend at school too.

459
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,148
LAST SUMMER

460
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,232
(birds squawking)

461
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,318
WONSEOK:
<i>I went to Daebu Island with my girlfriend.</i>

462
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,322
Wow, I can see hearts in your eyes.
You're so in love.

463
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,866
-Hey, hey!
-What else did you do with Hong Ajung?

464
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,287
-It's nothing. Ah, it's nothing.
-What? Show me.

465
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,538
Hey, why are you trying
to keep it to yourself?

466
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,207
-Show me, huh? Show me.
-No, it's nothing. You're making it shake!

467
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,084
-It's not shaking. Just show me! Come on.
-Uh, next time, next time.

468
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,168
(laughs)
Hey, stop, okay?

469
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,087
You...

470
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,089
Didn't you and Wonseok go
to Daebu Island together

471
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,548
and have grilled clams?

472
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,591
(scoffs)

473
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,845
I would die if I ate shellfish.

474
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,141
My allergies are so fucking severe
it would kill me.

475
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,769
Jeez, I don't think
I can keep listening to this bullshit.

476
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,814
Was he in a relationship with himself?
Was he a pervert or what?

477
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,234
Hey.

478
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,736
Was that everything
you wanted to know about Wonseok?

479
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,363
Are we done here?

480
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,254
-(indistinct chatter)
-(Ajung slurps)

481
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,800
(slurping continues)

482
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,891
(chomps)

483
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,437
(slurping continues)

484
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,729
(belches)

485
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,649
-You're incredible.
-What?

486
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,902
Didn't you already
have two servings of school lunch?

487
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,113
Did you give up on becoming an idol star
and switch to being a mukbang streamer?

488
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,449
Don't you usually prefer
butter and cheese?

489
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,826
You didn't use to like kimchi before...

490
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,744
(chomps)

491
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,371
I'm surprised too.

492
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,998
The mysteries of the human body.

493
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,000
(chomps, smacks lips)

494
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,504
(sighs)

495
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,048
I'm pregnant.

496
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,759
I'm twelve weeks pregnant.

497
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,512
(whispering)
You're crazy.

498
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,972
(sighs lightly)

499
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,057
That wasn't funny at all.

500
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,642
Let's go.

501
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,854
Excuse me, how much is the total?

502
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,439
It's 21,000 Won.

503
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,066
-Hey, are you really puking?
-(groans)

504
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,320
Are you being serious?

505
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,322
I'm serious.
(gasps)

506
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,948
(thuds)

507
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,825
Oh, my god!

508
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,703
Ah.
(sighs awkwardly)

509
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,999
(singing inaudibly)

510
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,377
PREGNANCY JOURNAL

511
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,009
I took this at eight weeks.

512
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,260
I'm going for a check-up tomorrow,

513
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,762
and I'll have an ultrasound
since it's been 12 weeks.

514
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,306
-Are you really going to have the baby?
-Of course I will.

515
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,724
I have no other choice.

516
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,101
What about your life?
Does your mom know about this?

517
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,978
By the way, who's the father?

518
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,064
This is my life,
and nothing about that will change.

519
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,398
My mom knows about it too.

520
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,401
Who's the father?
I can't tell you that right now.

521
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,903
You're driving me crazy.

522
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,738
Are you going to keep coming to school?

523
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:32,697
Well, I came back to school

524
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,783
because it's safer after
the first 12 weeks have passed, but...

525
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,410
I don't think I'll be able to graduate,
don't you think?

526
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,246
I was thinking I'd drop out
after the summer break this year.

527
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,830
I see you're a planner.

528
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,166
What about the father?

529
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,377
Does he also want this baby?
Can he take responsibility for it?

530
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,504
We're going to take care of it together.

531
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,674
I have a close relationship
with the baby's father.

532
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,133
You're ridiculous.

533
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,178
Is there anything we can do to help?

534
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,388
This is my first time
with something like this.

535
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,349
You see? This is why I like Sooheon.

536
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,643
-He's got the basics down.
-(scoffs)

537
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,436
He's really a decent human being.

538
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,398
Sooheon, I'll let you know
when I need help.

539
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,316
Please just keep this a secret.

540
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,568
Soyeon.

541
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,153
You can prepare a wig, some heavy makeup,

542
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,489
and an outfit tomorrow
so that you can pass as my older sister.

543
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,199
You're coming to the clinic
with me tomorrow.

544
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,409
(scoffs)

545
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,953
(grunts)

546
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,123
(violin strums)

547
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,716
Hold on.

548
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,342
Sejin.

549
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,970
How many hours did you practice yesterday?

550
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:40,056
Oh, yesterday I practiced
for about six hours.

551
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,766
Do you think that's enough?

552
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,561
You won't be able to get into a college
in the US if you don't give it your all.

553
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:48,398
Here. Don't stop here and slur your bow
to make it sound smooth.

554
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,400
Okay.

555
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,693
Let's try again.

556
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,866
(violin strums)

557
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,747
(light music)

558
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,143
HOW ARE THINGS GOING WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

559
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,061
SIX MONTHS AGO

560
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,020
CHANKYU: STOP BEING SO NOSY.

561
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,396
THIS IS THE ONLY THING
THAT BRINGS ME JOY THESE DAYS

562
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,356
CHANKYU: STOP BEING SO NOSY?

563
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,398
PLEASE HAVE MERCY ON ME.

564
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,483
COME ON, SEND ME A PHOTO.

565
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,692
(breathes deeply)

566
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,943
CHANKYU

567
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:39,491
THE CAFÉ WE OFTEN VISIT.

568
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,117
OH THAT LOOKS DELICIOUS

569
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,455
DON'T YOU HAVE PICTURES
WITH YOUR FACES IN THEM???

570
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,665
CHANKYU: THIS IS HOW
WE ALWAYS TAKE PICTURES.

571
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,999
(soft laugh)

572
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,214
(light music)

573
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,727
May I take your order?

574
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,313
Oh, can I have a grapefruit ade?

575
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,272
Oh, also...

576
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,358
By any chance,
do you recognize this person?

577
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,902
Ah, I don't think so.

578
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:19,114
I recently inherited this café
from my older sister.

579
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,448
Oh.

580
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,533
That's Park Wonseok.

581
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,243
Oh.

582
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,245
Oh, Sejin, do you know that person?

583
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,372
Welcome.

584
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,833
May I take your order?

585
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,051
Ah, I was in the same class
as Wonseok in sophomore year.

586
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,177
(breathes lightly)

587
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,929
Our school's so far from here.

588
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,181
How did you end up
getting a part-time job here?

589
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,310
I take violin lessons over there.
I'm trying to get into a conservatory.

590
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,732
Um, I dropped out of Yongtan High
after finishing my junior year last year.

591
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,484
Oh, you dropped out.

592
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,319
I'm heading for the US next month

593
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,739
because I'm preparing to apply
to colleges in the US.

594
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:02,991
I see.

595
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,952
By the way,
what brings you all the way here?

596
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,371
-It's pretty far from school.
-Oh...

597
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:14,043
Well, Wonseok and I were in the same club,
so we would message each other often.

598
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,297
I remembered him telling me
that he used to come to this café often.

599
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,132
(laughs lightly)

600
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,509
Seems like you and Wonseok
must have been close.

601
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,886
Especially if you made it a point
to come here yourself.

602
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,179
(laughs awkwardly)

603
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,431
I also...

604
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,600
still think of Wonseok often.

605
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,854
He used to sit over there.

606
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,357
Since I'm still working here part-time,

607
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,526
I can't help but think of him.

608
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,570
You must have been

609
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,781
really close to Wonseok.

610
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,074
(laughs lightly)
We were close.

611
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,703
He saved my life.

612
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,289
He was really a good person.

613
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,000
He was...

614
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,044
a good person?

615
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,462
Yeah.

616
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,756
Thanks to him,
I was able to stay in school.

617
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:05,011
TWO YEARS AGO, SPRING, SOPHOMORE YEAR

618
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,304
JUNGGYEONG: Hey, Sejin!

619
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,434
(Eunhyuk and Seojun laugh)

620
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,894
-EUNHYUK: Bullseye.
-(coughs)

621
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,106
(breathes deeply)

622
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,693
Hey, is it true
you have two fathers at home?

623
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,947
Is that right? Or was it two mothers?

624
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,365
-(laughs)
-Huh?

625
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,700
If you have two male parents,
who's the father and who's the mother?

626
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,578
-Is the one with the beard the dad?
-Crazy bastard.

627
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,831
(sniffs)
Shit.

628
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,582
Does something smell gay to you?

629
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,751
Oh, did the gayness rub off on you? Huh?
(laughs)

630
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,337
Oh, it looks like
you have egg on you. Here.

631
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,381
Well...
(breathes deeply)

632
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,633
It's a long story, but...

633
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,679
I was adopted when I was five.

634
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,098
I don't even know
what my biological parents look like.

635
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,267
When I was a junior in 8th grade,
my parents divorced,

636
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,185
and my father came out

637
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,604
as gay.

638
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:01,651
Um, I do refer to him
as my younger dad, but in any case,

639
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,403
I live with two dads.

640
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,030
Do you understand?

641
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,657
Yeah.

642
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:17,959
(chuckles)

643
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,169
Oh, my Sejin.

644
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,462
You really worked up a sweat, huh?

645
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,214
-(scoffs)
-It's time to take a shower.

646
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,844
Oh, I heard that gay people
wash themselves with milk. Is that true?

647
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,054
-Here.
-(gasps)

648
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,473
-(laughs)
-(cheers)

649
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,392
-Hey.
-Shit. Damn.

650
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,351
-(Seojun laughs)
-(exhales deeply)

651
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,895
Ugh, something feels off, doesn't it?

652
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,063
Sejin, should we take our clothes off
so we can wash up properly?

653
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,982
Don't touch me, you fucker.
(breathes in anger)

654
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,984
You fucking bastard,
you have a death wish...

655
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,740
-What are you doing, motherfucker?
-Hey!

656
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,159
Stop fucking around and get lost.

657
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,827
What the fuck is he saying?

658
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,038
(scoffs)

659
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,123
Oh, are you guys a couple?

660
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,709
(both groan)

661
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,921
(groans in pain)
You motherfucker!

662
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,381
(scoffs)
Well, shit! Hey!

663
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,216
Who do you think you are? Huh?

664
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,260
(grunts)

665
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,762
-(scoffs)
-(pants)

666
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,972
Okay, let's see what you got.
You little...

667
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,017
(groans in pain, coughs)

668
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,769
-(Wonseok pants)
-Fuck.

669
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:22,231
(Junggyeong moans, coughs)

670
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,861
(groans in pain)

671
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,115
(suspenseful music)

672
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,210
(sighs)

673
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,967
Let's go.

674
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,761
Okay.

675
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,393
(light music)

676
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,776
WONSEOK: <i>The truth is...</i>

677
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,237
there's something I haven't told you.

678
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:11,864
(sighs lightly)

679
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,616
When I was eight years old,

680
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,493
I was adopted from an orphanage,
just like you.

681
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,329
I also have a twin sister.
She's the younger one.

682
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,331
She's still at the orphanage in Busan.

683
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,375
Oh, I see.

684
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,171
This is my sister, Ok Chanmi.

685
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,008
I'm really jealous
you have a younger sister.

686
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,053
-You're jealous?
-Yeah.

687
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,055
Really.

688
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,558
I think it'd be really cool.

689
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,809
(chuckles)

690
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,644
Then let's all hang out together one day.

691
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,523
(chuckles)

692
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,941
Sure, sounds good.

693
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,317
(chuckles)

694
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,495
(sighs)

695
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,466
MOK JEONGHYEON OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY

696
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:29,150
Come to think of it,
I think your boobs have gotten bigger.

697
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,402
(scoffs)
Shut up.

698
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,403
(laughs)

699
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,988
Ms. Hong.

700
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,531
Please head to the doctor's office.

701
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,825
MOK JEONGHYEON OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY

702
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,119
Excuse me.

703
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,497
-It's our turn.
-It won't take long.

704
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,041
DOCTOR'S OFFICE 1
MOK JEONGHYEON

705
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,375
(door closes)

706
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,340
JEONGHYEON: <i>How have you been?</i>

707
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,008
How have you been feeling?

708
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,307
HEAD DOCTOR MOK JEONGHYEON

709
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,600
Why are you so surprised?

710
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,976
How can you be here?

711
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,937
I don't want to drag this on
for very long.

712
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,315
I heard you sued my parents while I was
in the juvenile detention center.

713
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,691
Drop the lawsuit.

714
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,026
Get out.

715
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,152
Get out right now.

716
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,614
I will, once I have your answer.
Will you drop the lawsuit?

717
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,324
(shouting)
Get out! Get out right now!

718
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,327
Get out before I call the police!
Get out! Get out!

719
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,205
Get out, you demon!

720
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,832
-What the heck?
-(Jeonghyeon wails)

721
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm sorry. Please hold on for a minute.

722
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,004
That's definitely Ju Hyeokgeon.

723
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,257
Huh? Do you know him?

724
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,217
I went to middle school with him.

725
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,969
His name is Ju Hyeokgeon.

726
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,513
There was a huge incident.

727
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,098
-Doctor Mok! Please lean back.
-(breathes heavily)

728
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,475
-Doctor! Doctor!
-(gasps)

729
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,352
Jeez, do I have
to make another appointment?

730
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,895
What a mess.

731
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,522
That kid goes into the doctor's office
for a brief moment,

732
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,357
and then the doctor faints,
like what the...

733
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,525
Right.

734
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,360
The victim's mother was a doctor.

735
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,948
Oh, that's right!
The victim's mother was a doctor!

736
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,116
What?

737
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,118
The victim?

738
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,494
ORDER HERE
WE MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY

739
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,122
So, that guy back there
killed the doctor's daughter?

740
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,666
I think it was the second semester
of 8th grade.

741
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,460
Wow, I can't believe
it's already been over two years.

742
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,545
Wow, shit.

743
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,630
Then why is he walking the streets
like nothing happened

744
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,798
when he should be rotting in prison?

745
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,633
A minor never goes to prison.

746
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,843
A minor?

747
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,094
Damn.

748
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,137
(sighs)

749
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,722
The victim was stabbed to death.

750
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,015
Brutally.

751
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,141
So you mean...

752
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,268
the doctor's daughter

753
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,146
was murdered like that
when she was in middle school?

754
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,647
I think he was put on probation
or something,

755
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,317
even after he committed murder,
because he was a minor.

756
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,320
He was in a juvenile detention center
for a while and that was it for him.

757
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,617
(breathes roughly)

758
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,417
(grunts)

759
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,504
So did you say
you're a friend of Sooheon's?

760
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,048
Oh, yes.

761
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,299
I'm the director at this gym.

762
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,842
(surprised gasp)
Hello.

763
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,469
So, you'd like to register
for the beginner class?

764
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,429
Yes.

765
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,472
In that case, there's a promotion

766
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,224
that'll give you
a discount for six months.

767
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,517
That's a great deal for a student
on a budget.

768
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,603
Why don't we fill out a registration card
for the time being?

769
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,231
He can't register, director.
(grunts)

770
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,690
-Why not?
-(sighs)

771
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,776
He's a senior, so he's gotta study.

772
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,153
If you want to learn,
come after you've graduated.

773
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,242
I'll be right out after a quick shower.
Do you want to wait outside?

774
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,326
Sure.

775
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,746
Ugh, that idiot.

776
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,290
He's ruining things again, seriously.

777
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,541
What did I even like about him

778
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,001
to start training him
in the first place? God.

779
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,795
GOGO STADIUM

780
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,547
MMA, KICKBOXING, JIUJITSU,
MUY THAI, LOSING WEIGHT

781
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,175
Fuck.

782
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,930
Look at him.

783
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,057
(spits)
Mister.

784
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,645
(sniffles)
Are you a minor by any chance?

785
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,398
-I'm an adult.
-Okay.

786
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,565
-What?
-Mister.

787
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,734
Can you do me a favor
and buy me some cigarettes?

788
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,363
You insolent punks.

789
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,531
(scoffs)

790
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,117
-Get lost, jackass.
-(all laugh)

791
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,618
Why are you talking to me like that?

792
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,203
(mockingly)
Get lost, jackass.

793
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,038
(both mockingly)
Get lost, jackass.

794
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,373
(all laugh)

795
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,958
-Mister, come here, come here.
-Let's go, let's go.

796
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,376
-Hey.
-It won't take long, come on.

797
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,961
Let me go!
(grunts)

798
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,004
Hey!

799
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,673
Hey, that's Ji Sooheon.

800
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,716
-Leave.
-What's he doing here?

801
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,092
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

802
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,053
-Right?
-Damn, these bastards.

803
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,141
Man.

804
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,560
I could've handled them myself.

805
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,438
What are you doing here?

806
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,943
(upbeat music)

807
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,866
SOOHEON: Woo!

808
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,538
-(laughs)
-Are you having fun?

809
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,083
(Sooheon screams)

810
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,002
(Sooheon laughs)

811
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,550
Woo!

812
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,719
(yells)

813
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,554
Wow! So nice!

814
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,558
(Sooheon grunts)

815
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,186
Hey, that was awesome!

816
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,187
(laughs)

817
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,855
You know, you're a great driver!

818
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,106
When did you start driving?

819
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,900
As you already know,
I can't really remember, but...

820
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,693
I heard I started driving here
since sophomore year.

821
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,362
My dad probably hooked me up
or something like that.

822
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,863
My body seems to remember how to drive.

823
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:26,864
(chuckles)

824
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,032
Want to give it a try?

825
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,450
Me?

826
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,369
I don't even have a license,
and I've never driven before.

827
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,620
You drive a motorcycle, don't you?

828
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,538
But this is different, isn't it?

829
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,124
I'll ask if they can clear the track.

830
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,418
If you're the only one driving,
it should be just fine, right?

831
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,716
(exhales deeply)

832
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,177
(exhales nervously)

833
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,137
Okay, slowly lift your foot off.

834
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,390
That's right, good, good.

835
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,600
That's right.
Step on the middle one there.

836
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:55,768
There you go, left, right.

837
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,770
-Just slightly.
-Yeah.

838
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,355
Not too much pressure, easy.

839
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,940
-(tires screech)
-(both gasp)

840
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,066
What?

841
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,859
Nothing, nothing.
I think I'll be fine if I try again.

842
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,820
Yeah, d... don't step
on the break like that.

843
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:06,821
-Sorry.
-Oh, okay.

844
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,031
-Okay, should we go again?
-Okay, slowly...

845
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,616
You got it, right?
Don't hit the brakes so suddenly.

846
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,660
-Okay.
-Yeah? Now, step on the accelerator.

847
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,161
Good, good, good, good.

848
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,497
You're doing great. Let's go.

849
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,207
-There you go!
-(engine revs)

850
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,751
JAEBUM: Good, that's it.
Wow, keep going on like this!

851
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,129
Keep on, keep on, keep on!

852
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,630
That's great!

853
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,341
(both cheer)

854
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,721
(grunts)

855
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,515
-(laughs)
-(grunts)

856
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,891
-(groans)
-Hey, what was that?

857
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,435
That was awesome!

858
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,811
-You're such a good driver.
-(laughs)

859
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,479
Didn't I tell you you'd be a good driver?

860
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,480
(grunts)

861
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,190
JAEBUM: It always feels nice
after a good ride like that.

862
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,484
SOOHEON: Ah, yeah.
By the way, this car's really fast.

863
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,069
Thanks to you,
I really blew all my stress.

864
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,988
-(Sooheon exhales deeply)
-JAEBUM: Let's come back again.

865
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:51,365
SHOPPING MALL ENTRANCE

866
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,287
JI SOOHEON
SOOHEON, COME UP TO THE ROOFTOP...

867
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,003
You didn't have to
drive me all the way up here.

868
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,755
-Are you working part-time here?
-Yeah.

869
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,507
You should come bowling sometime.
You know I got you covered.

870
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,675
(soft chuckle)

871
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:10,885
You really helped me relieve some stress.
Thanks a lot.

872
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,637
Oh, not at all, it was nothing.
Let's go again when we have the chance.

873
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,432
-I'd love to.
-Okay, then. Take care.

874
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,228
Soyeon.

875
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,813
Did something good happen to you?

876
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,815
-You look excited.
-Well, yeah.

877
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,443
-You're not here to bowl, are you?
-Nope.

878
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,613
Oh, um, come up to the rooftop
after your shift.

879
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,864
We need to talk business.

880
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,408
Business?

881
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,911
There's another kid out there
that needs to be taught a lesson.

882
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,676
(car alarm beeps)

887
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,278
Mother.

888
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,321
Oh, Jaebum, you haven't had dinner, right?

889
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,614
I heard you went to the race track.

890
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,782
Mother.

891
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,577
Did anyone come inside my room
while I was taking a shower?

892
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,786
No.

893
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,705
No one went in there.

894
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,165
There's no one in this house
who would go inside your room.

895
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,001
Why do you ask?

896
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,587
It's nothing. I'll be there soon.

897
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,173
Hurry up, your father will be here soon.

898
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,383
Okay.

899
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,976
JAEBUM: <i>I never leave my key here.</i>

(suspicious music)

901
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,214
(suspicious music continues)

902
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,101
Who is that?

903
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,107
A juvenile?

904
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,068
-A juvenile delinquent?
-Yeah.

905
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,694
He's a piece of shit.

906
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,907
6 HOURS AGO

907
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:30,709
How do you know my daughter Eunjin?

908
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,461
Dr. Mok, did Ju Hyeokgeon come

909
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,756
and visit you yesterday?

910
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,675
Who are you?

911
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,593
I've also experienced injustice in my life

912
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,470
just like you.

913
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,182
It was my younger sister.

914
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,726
Juvenile delinquents deserve
to be punished

915
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,229
to the fullest extent of their crimes.

916
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,898
No one who committed a planned,
brutal murder like that

917
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,068
should ever be forgiven.

918
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,366
(sobs)

919
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:06,870
TWO YEARS AND THREE MONTHS AGO

920
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,333
(suspenseful music)

921
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:31,603
What?

922
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,022
Didn't I tell you not to come here?

923
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,693
Get lost.

924
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,112
Fucking bitch.

925
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,531
-(grunts)
-(groans in pain)

926
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,534
(grunts)

927
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,496
-(grunts)
-(groans in pain)

928
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,831
(screams)
You fucking bitch!

929
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,834
You think you're all that, huh?
You arrogant bitch!

930
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:54,960
-(groans)
-Didn't I say I'd kill you?

931
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:58,714
You thought I wouldn't do it? Fuck you!

932
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,133
(breathes roughly)
Fuck!

933
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,681
(breathes roughly)

934
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,894
(pants)

935
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,733
(gasps)

936
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,072
JEONGHYEON: <i>He stabbed my Eunjin 20 times</i>

937
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,034
<i>just because she refused
to be his girlfriend.</i>

938
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,912
<i>Because she rejected him
in front of the other students.</i>

939
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:31,955
Eunjin! Eunjin!
(sobbing)

940
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,917
<i>Then, as he threw
the knife on the floor, he said...</i>

941
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,210
Ma'am,
report me to the police if you will.

942
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,252
(laughs)

943
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,712
I'm a minor anyway.

944
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,423
What?
(screams)

945
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,342
JEONGHYEON: <i>That he wouldn't be punished</i>

946
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,761
<i>because he was a minor.</i>
(cries)

947
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,018
If you take care of this job,

948
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,687
that'll cover six months
of your mom's bills.

949
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,272
So I have to

950
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,442
make that bastard

951
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,862
kneel and apologize in front
of the mother who lost her daughter?

952
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,283
Let's figure out his route,
then decide when and where we'll do it.

953
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,369
Okay.

954
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,538
Ah, well...

955
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,790
This conversation was much shorter
than I thought it would be.

956
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,502
If you have something to tell me,
don't use your cell phone.

957
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,963
Leave me a note or tell me in person.
Don't forget.

958
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,256
I won't.

959
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,925
-Let's go.
-Oh, wait!

960
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,596
Also, this is something
I wanted to mention, but...

961
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,768
don't you think you were too harsh
on Sa Junggyeong last time?

962
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,729
Yeah.

963
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,731
I wasn't really thinking about it,

964
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,859
but somehow I ended up
going harder than I meant to.

965
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:42,818
I'll be more careful.

966
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,821
Oh, actually,
I'm fine with you punishing them harder.

967
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:49,199
It's just that if the situation escalates,
we'll have to deal with the police.

968
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,284
Sorry.

969
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,743
I'll be more careful.

970
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,954
I didn't mean like that.

971
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,373
(soft chuckle)

972
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,967
When I lose my focus,

973
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,428
I prefer coffee to an energy drink.

974
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,221
How about you?

975
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,974
You should rest
when you're starting to lose focus, Osung.

976
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,476
The coffee's delicious.

977
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,479
-Huh?
-Hey!

978
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,107
Hey.

979
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,152
-Did you get home okay?
-Of course. What about you?

980
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,653
-Yeah.
-Ji Sooheon.

981
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,196
Do you want a cup of coffee?

982
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,115
Thank you for offering,
but I don't drink coffee.

983
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:33,327
Hey, Sooheon,
I have something to tell you.

984
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,579
-Hey, Osung, I'm going to head inside.
-What did you want to tell me?

985
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,715
What's this?

986
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,841
2022 PRO BASKETBALL LEAGUE
CHAMPIONS SERIES

987
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,676
Champions series
for pro basketball league?

988
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,097
-Champions series?
-It's in the first row.

989
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,016
Right behind the bench.

990
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,477
-Wow, this is amazing.
-(chuckles)

991
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,606
Are you free tonight?

992
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,524
Me?

993
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,110
Can I really have this precious ticket?

994
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,654
(laughs)
Of course it's for you.

995
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,572
Am I dreaming?

996
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,366
It's tonight. Can you go?

997
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:16,203
Of course I'm going! Wow, damn.

998
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,204
(chuckles)

999
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,789
Is this a VIP ticket?

1000
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,123
I got it from someone I know.

1001
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,209
-(exhales deeply)
-I thought you might like basketball.

1002
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,211
I'm a huge fan. How did you know?

1003
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,963
(chuckles)
I saw you playing.

1004
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,131
-TEACHER: Don't forget your homework.
-STUDENTS: Okay.

1005
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,676
(indistinct chatter)

1006
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,886
JAEBUM: Hey, Osung.

1007
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,514
I have something to ask you.

1008
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,766
(sighs)
What is it?

1009
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,312
Do you know who this guy is?

1010
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,775
-Why?
-Hey, did you take notes?

1011
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,318
-STUDENT: Yeah.
-AJUNG: I didn't take any.

1012
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,195
Is this the one? That's so much text.

1013
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,030
Why?

1014
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,159
That's Park Wonseok.

1015
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:58,954
Park Wonseok?

1016
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,832
This guy is Park Wonseok?

1017
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,210
LITERATURE

1018
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,013
-Ah, welcome.
-How are you doing?

1019
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,014
How can I help you today?

1020
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,348
Please replace these wheels
with black ones.

1021
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,267
-Okay, so, all of them?
-Yes.

1022
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,435
Okay, got it.

1023
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,562
-Hyeokgeon! Come here.
-Yes?

1024
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:26,898
Go get us some coffee.

1025
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,775
-Why don't we head inside?
-Sure.

1026
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,451
-Hello.
-Hi.

1027
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,119
I'll have two iced americanos, please.

1028
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,412
Ah.

1029
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,122
It looks like your father
has another customer.

1030
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,041
Yes.
(chuckles)

1031
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:47,335
Your father must be happy
to have such a good son

1032
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,379
who helps him with his business.

1033
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:51,757
Hold on.

1034
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,430
There.
(chuckles)

1035
00:50:58,513 --> 00:50:59,639
Thank you.

1036
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,224
(chuckles)
Bye.

1037
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,159
-He's handsome.
-(laughs)

1038
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,535
Looks like he's the son
of the body shop owner.

1039
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,536
Yeah.

1040
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,538
I heard he left to study abroad
and then came back

1041
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,665
because he struggled to adjust
or something like that.

1042
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,583
I see.

1043
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,336
It seems like he's chosen to work
with his father.

1044
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,379
That's a great choice, really.

1045
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,757
If you're going to study,
you've got to excel.

1046
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,801
If you're just mediocre,
it won't make much of a difference.

1047
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,095
You're right.
It's good to learn practical skills.

1048
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,597
He's spending all his time
at the body shop, learning the trade.

1049
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,516
He practices even after work
going home late at night.

1050
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,560
He's a diligent kid.

1051
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,270
(chuckles)

1052
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:57,906
MMA, KICKBOXING, JIUJITSU,
MUY THAI, LOSING WEIGHT

1053
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,950
GOGO STADIUM
MMA CHAMPIONSHIP

1054
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,206
Soyeon.

1055
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,416
Did anything happen at school
while I was gone?

1056
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,210
Wow, you didn't go...

1057
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,630
(sighs)
I have Ju Hyeokgeon's route.

1058
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,341
I think we can do it today.

1059
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,552
Today?
(inhales deeply)

1060
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,428
Can we do it another day?

1061
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,514
Why? Do you have another commitment?

1062
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:23,431
I...

1063
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,350
It's just... I have something today.

1064
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,978
That bastard Ju Hyeokgeon is going
to be alone at a body shop tonight.

1065
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,105
Tomorrow, he'll move to a dorm
to start at a mechanic school.

1066
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,274
Today's our last chance.

1067
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,776
What kind of appointment is it?

1068
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,153
Can you just postpone it?

1069
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,573
I'll postpone it.

1070
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,325
Let's do it tonight.
I'll go ahead and prepare.

1071
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:43,785
Ah, let me take your cellphone.

1072
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,288
I'll wait somewhere far away
from the body shop.

1073
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,415
Wait, let me just send
a text message really quickly.

1074
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,250
IT'S ME SOOHEON...
I'M REALLY SORRY :(

1075
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:53,086
I WON'T BE ABLE TO GO
TO THE GAME TONIGHT.

1076
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,005
IT'S AN URGENT MATTER. I'M SO SORRY :(

1077
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,967
This is the body shop
where Ju Hyeokgeon will be at.

1078
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,886
He'll be there alone
after the business closes for the day.

1079
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:04,097
And here's a transit pass you can use.

1080
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,901
(sighs)

1081
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,077
(exhales deeply)

1082
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,881
The person you dialed cannot be reached...

1083
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,382
JI SOOHEON

1084
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,303
(inhales deeply)

1085
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,223
(suspenseful music)

1086
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,157
(exhales deeply)

1087
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,045
(breathes nervously)

1088
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,505
(exhales deeply)

1089
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:28,098
(rock music playing)

1090
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:50,078
Dad, is that you?

1091
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,463
Who's there?

1092
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,656
(muffled groaning)

1093
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,332
(muffled groaning continues)

1094
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,168
(Sooheon with modulated voice)
Ju Hyeokgeon. Nod if you're listening.

1095
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,879
(muffled scream)

1096
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:47,177
(with modulated voice)
Ju Hyeokgeon. Nod if you're listening.

1097
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,429
(grunts)

1098
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,765
(whimpers)

1099
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,309
(breathes deeply)

1100
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,189
(groans)

1101
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,565
(gasps)

1102
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,525
You know what with these tools,
I can modify your body like a car.

1103
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,737
-Do you catch my drift?
-(breathes deeply)

1104
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:10,408
-(gasps)
-Nip a bit here, tuck a bit there.

1105
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,203
-(groans)
-Break this.

1106
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,955
Cut that off. Isn't that right?

1107
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,336
You brutally murdered Shim Eunjin,
a female classmate,

1108
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,463
two years and three months ago.

1109
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,839
(groans)

1110
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:27,884
You should end up just like her,
don't you think?

1111
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:28,968
(groans)

1112
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,553
Maybe I can just stab you twenty times.

1113
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,347
Wouldn't that be fair?

1114
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,807
(muffled)
Spare me!

1115
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,600
-(muffled groan)
-Spare you?

1116
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,143
(muffled)
Please, spare my life.

1117
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,437
I would if you were a minor.

1118
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:41,940
(sobs)

1119
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,900
But you aren't one anymore.

1120
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:45,819
(groans)

1121
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,739
(muffled)
Spare my life.

1122
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:51,783
-(grunts)
-(Hyeokgeon groans)

1123
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,828
Spare me. Forgive me.

1124
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,788
These are words you should say
to Shim Eunjin's mother.

1125
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:57,956
-(groans)
-You got me?

1126
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,416
(groans)

1127
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,419
This is your last warning.

1128
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,254
Apologize to her
from the bottom of your heart.

1129
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:08,091
Whether she forgives you or not,
you apologize to her.

1130
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:10,301
(groans)

1131
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,598
(breathes heavily)

1132
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,559
(grunts)

1133

-(inhales deeply)
-(groans)

1134
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,688
(pants)

1135
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:27,026
-(breathes deeply)
-(inhales deeply)

1136
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,153
(gasps)

1137
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,029
(groans)

1138
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,365
(sobbing)

1139
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,952
As proof of your promise,
I'm going to take a few of your fingers.

1140
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,412
(groans)

1141
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:38,788
(screams)

1142
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,082
-(shouts)
-(handsaw buzzing)

1143
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:46,004
(muffled shouting)
Please! Spare me!

1144
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,339
(screams)

1145
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,052
(shouts)

1146
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,722
Please, please! Forgive me!

1147
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,183
(groans)

1148
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:00,768
(muffled shouting)

1149
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,278
(muffled shouting continues)

1150
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,873
(breathes roughly)

1151
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,292
(pants)

1152
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,755
(sighs lightly)

1153
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:36,554
(upbeat music)

1154
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,199
Did everything go okay last night?

1155
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:58,409
Everything went well.

1156
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,204
Okay.

1157
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:02,997
Ah!

1158
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:09,712
That bastard

1159
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,257
will visit the hospital today
to apologize.

1160
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,634
Bastards like that really deserve
to die though.

1161
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:17,762
Good work.

1162
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,231
(indistinct chatter)

1163
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,613
DO NOT CROSS-POLICE LINE
UNDER INVESTIGATION

1164
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:38,616
-What's going on?
-Sir, you're here.

1165
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,867
Where? Where is it?

1166
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,619
Over there.

1167
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,666
What is this mess?

1168
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,210
This way.

1169
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:55,842
(grunts)

1170
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,062
(closing theme music)
