1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,800
Hi, guys. I am Tom Holland.

2
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:05,269
I'm joined today by
Tobey Maguire

3
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:06,304
and Andrew Garfield.

4
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:07,972
We just wanted to take a moment

5
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:09,173
to say a massive thank you

6
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:12,210
for all of your continued love
and support for this film.

7
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:13,544
While we were making
this film,

8
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,847
I think I can speak on behalf
of all of us that we knew

9
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,316
that we had our hands
on something really special.

10
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,385
But I don't think
we could ever have imagined

11
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,154
it would have been received
as well as it has been.

12
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,222
So thank you so much.

13
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:27,992
We are just incredibly grateful
that you guys are here for it.

14
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:30,628
Thank you to everybody
for supporting this movie.

15
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,900
I got to show up with these guys
and have a beautiful experience.

16
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:38,269
Andrew, we have
something to tell you.

17
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:38,970
What?

18
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,104
It's important to both of us

19
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,809
that you know this.
Okay?

20
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,776
We love you.
We love you.

21
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:45,576
About time.

22
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,011
I've been waiting months.

23
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:50,014
I've been waiting months
since that day in Atlanta.

24
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,182
-I had it in here.
-Yeah.

25
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:54,052
It took every part of me
not to say that.

26
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,086
This was worth the wait,

27
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:59,559
and I will wait for you guys
for centuries.

28
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:03,027
We come to you now
with revelations

29
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,529
about last week's attack
in London.

30
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,165
An anonymous source
provided this video.

31
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:10,134
It shows Quentin Beck,
aka Mysterio,

32
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,736
moments before his death.

33
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,738
You may find
this video disturbing.

34
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,907
I managed to send
the Elemental back,

35
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,943
but I don't think I'm gonna
make it off this bridge alive.

36
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,011
Spider-Man attacked me.

37
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,246
He has an army of drones,
Stark technology.

38
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,583
He's saying he's gonna be
the new Iron Man. No one else.

39
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,453
Are you sure you want
to commence the drone attack?

40
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,455
There will be
significant casualties.

41
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,890
Do it. Execute them all.

42
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:39,597
This shocking video
was released earlier today

43
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,567
on the controversial
news website TheDailyBugle.net.

44
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,269
- There you have it, folks.
- Conclusive proof

45
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,971
that Spider-Man was responsible

46
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,540
for the brutal murder
of Mysterio,

47
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,708
an interdimensional warrior

48
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,677
who gave his life
to protect our planet

49
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,179
and who will, no doubt,
go down in history

50
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:59,383
as the greatest superhero
of all time.

51
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,852
But that's not all, folks.

52
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,053
Here's the real blockbuster.

53
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,921
Brace yourselves.
You might wanna sit down.

54
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:07,758
- Spider-Man's real--
- Spider-Man's real name is--

55
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,499
Spider-Man's name
is Peter Parker.

56
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,198
What the f--?

57
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,667
That's right, folks.
Peter Parker.

58
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,704
A 17-year-old
high school delinquent...

59
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,874
She knows him.
Are you Spider-Man's girlfriend?

60
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:23,774
...is, in fact...

61
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,042
Are you Spider-Man's
girlfriend?

62
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,411
...the vile vigilante villain
Spider-Man.

63
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,247
Yo, it's him.
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

64
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,782
Please don't touch her, sir.
You're just a kid?

65
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,484
You murdered Mysterio?
Um...

66
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,819
You helped him?
No, I didn't--

67
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,121
Come on, kid,
let me see your face.

68
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,856
He hit me.
Spider-Man hit me!

69
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:39,924
Come on.
He hit me.

70
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,460
All this time,
people looked up to this boy

71
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,561
and called him a hero.

72
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:47,265
I'll tell you what I call him,
public enemy number one!

73
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,201
I told you I never wanted
to do this ever again!

74
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,503
MJ, I'm so sorry,
but I can't see anything

75
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,538
with your hand in my--

76
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,939
Sorry. Where are we
gonna go?

77
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,074
-I don't know. Your house?
-No! No!

78
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,276
My dad will kill you.

79
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,545
What? You said
your dad really liked me.

80
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,882
Yeah, well, not anymore.

81
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,883
Dude.
Dude!

82
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,518
Dude!
Dude!

83
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,855
Dude!

84
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,491
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

85
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,825
No, not really. Uh...

86
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,863
Yo, Peter!

87
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,169
We should go.
We should go. Come on.

88
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,139
You said you don't want
to swing.
Swing me.

89
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,141
Okay. We can take the subway.

90
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,081
No.

91
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,088
Look out!

92
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,829
That was so much worse.

93
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:52,697
Okay. It's okay.

94
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,433
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

95
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:59,170
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, I'm so sorry.

96
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,749
Okay. Okay.

97
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,186
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,355
I just feel so dumb. I didn't
realize you were miserable.

99
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,056
No, it was really fun, right?

100
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,891
That's why they call it
a fling.

101
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,526
-And we flung.
-It was fun.

102
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:23,728
I could've been more fun.

103
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,529
I can be fun.
We'll hang out again.

104
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,101
Like, when do you think?

105
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,235
I should see what that is.

106
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,937
-No, no, no.
-It's what I do.

107
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,239
-He's always coming
and going.
-Peter?

108
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,440
- Peter?
- Oh, no.

109
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,675
- Oh, God. Peter?
- Oh, no.

110
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,311
I don't know what to do.
Peter. Peter.

111
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,380
Oh, I--
I didn't see anything.

112
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,748
This isn't what
it looks like.

113
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,783
No, no, May.
Practice safe--

114
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,119
Oh, hey. You must be MJ!

115
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,022
-Yeah. Nice to meet you.
-So nice to meet you.

116
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,357
Wait, have you
been crying?

117
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,861
We broke up.

118
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,264
Hey, Spider-Man!
Oh. Oh, uh...

119
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,464
Thank you. I didn't know
you broke up.

120
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,699
I thought you were
in love, May.

121
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,534
Can we talk about this
in the kitchen?

122
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:04,835
I should probably leave.

123
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,837
I thought you guys
were such a handsome couple.

124
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,273
It's really about boundaries.

125
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,776
-Let me answer the door.
-Let's go here.

126
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,377
-Is that the door?
-Hey. Is it true?

127
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,779
-I was gonna go, but...
-Not now.

128
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:18,316
I didn't know you were
so awkward about sex, Peter.

129
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,750
This has nothing to do
with sex.

130
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:24,624
- If you wanna go over it again.
- I mean-- What's that sound?

131
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,458
Hey, Spider-Man!
Oh, my God.

132
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,194
I mean, I'm happy to rehash it
if you want to.

133
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:33,831
You take care of your side,
I'll take care of mine.

134
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,034
What is up
with this phone?

135
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,969
Will you get off your phones
for five minutes?

136
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,206
I just wanna talk to you
about your relationship, okay?

137
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:42,973
Peter?

138
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,311
What?

139
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,449
- Is that--?
- Is that here?

140
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,152
Um...

141
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,398
- Yo, Peter Parker!
- Yo, Peter!

142
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,567
Maybe it's not
such a big deal.

143
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,335
Spider-Menace!

144
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,637
Governments around the world
launch investigations

145
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,607
into the murderer
known as Spider-Man,

146
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,942
aka Peter Parker,

147
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,945
aka the web-headed
war criminal

148
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,381
who, for years,
has been terrorizing

149
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,316
the decent citizens
of New York.

150
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,585
Well, now this city
and the world

151
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,986
see him for what he truly is.

152
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,321
New details from last week's

153
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,990
devastating attack in London
have emerged.

154
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,626
For more, we go now to Joint
Intelligence headquarters.

155
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,629
Authorities just a short
while ago confirmed

156
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,298
that the deadly drones used
in the London attack

157
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,601
were designed
by Stark Industries.

158
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,036
Federal agents! Open up!

159
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,539
Federal agents? You stay here.

160
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,673
Department of Damage Control.

161
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,642
We have a warrant
for the arrest of Peter Parker.

162
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,511
- You know the Fourth Amendment?
- Sure.

163
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,212
Unreasonable search
and seizure?

164
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,916
Get in here, guys. Let's go.

165
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,084
I didn't kill Quentin Beck.
The drones did, okay?

166
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,685
-The drones that are yours.
-No.

167
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,288
Well, look. Nick Fury was there
the entire time.

168
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,990
Ask him.
He can explain everything.

169
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,293
Nick Fury has been off-planet
for the last year.

170
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,195
- What?
- Peter! Hey.

171
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,864
MJ! They have nothing
to do with this, sir.

172
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:17,034
Don't say anything
without a lawyer.

173
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,335
I want a lawyer.

174
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,439
Ms. Jones-Watson.
Jones. I don't go by Watson.

175
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,241
Ms. Jones, why do you
want a lawyer if--?

176
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,543
If I have nothing to hide?

177
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,577
Exactly. Unless--

178
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,345
I'm actually
guilty of something?
Mm-hm.

179
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,248
I'm very aware of your tactics
and my rights.

180
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,451
Just answer my questions.

181
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,052
I've seen your file.

182
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,187
You're a smart young woman

183
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,622
with a bright future
ahead of her.

184
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,657
Why would you risk it all

185
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,394
by getting involved with
a vigilante like Peter Parker?

186
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,529
Washington Monument,

187
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,565
Venice Grand Canal,

188
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,466
Tower Bridge!

189
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,835
You know, if I didn't
know any better, Peter,

190
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:55,141
it's kind of like your enemy
is national landmarks.

191
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,110
So sorry to keep you waiting.

192
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,812
Can we get Ned a snack?
Absolutely.

193
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,347
He's been waiting.
I got you.

194
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,349
Dude, I'm so sorry about that.

195
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,418
I'm not supposed
to say anything to you.

196
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,687
Not even a thing.
I just have one question.

197
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,223
When MJ told you
Peter was Spider-Man--

198
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,191
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Heh.
-What's up?

199
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,392
I-I knew way before MJ did.

200
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,294
I was Spider-Man's
"guy in the chair."

201
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,162
I know about those.

202
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,431
Dude, half my guys
are guys in the chair.

203
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,365
Exactly. You would know.

204
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,667
I literally helped him
find the Vulture.

205
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,470
-I didn't know that.
-I helped him hack a suit once

206
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:27,705
and helped him get to space.

207
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:30,474
So in Spider-Man's
illegal vigilantism,

208
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,179
you were his main accomplice.

209
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:39,016
I would like to have my words
stricken from the record.

210
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:39,950
So if you did your job,

211
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:42,920
I wouldn't have to be on
the boat saving people's lives.

212
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,890
I climbed up the side
of the Washington Monument.

213
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,392
Okay, now we're getting
to some facts.

214
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,794
Tell me everything you know
about the Night Monkey.

215
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,329
Here's the funny thing
about the law.

216
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,330
It's usually not open

217
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,099
to random self-interest
interpretation.

218
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,166
Though you and I both know

219
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,335
that hasn't stopped people
like you from trying.

220
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:02,072
So, with all due respect, and
I mean that very insincerely,

221
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:05,809
unless you have some real
specific charges to throw at us,

222
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:06,977
legally, you can't hold us here.

223
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,847
Sounds like someone who's been
through the system before.

224
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,815
I've been arrested
at a couple of protests.

225
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,684
I'm a real career criminal.

226
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,619
You should lawyer up.

227
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,190
Child endangerment's
a nasty rap.

228
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:19,490
Excuse me?

229
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,591
A boy was entrusted to you,

230
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,893
and as his legal guardian,
essentially his mother,

231
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,329
you not only allowed him
to endanger himself,

232
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,631
but you actually
encouraged it.

233
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,233
Who does that?

234
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,634
I wanna see Peter right now.

235
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,837
Stark Industries
was caught in the web

236
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,574
of the Spider-Man-Mysterio
controversy today,

237
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,510
when federal agents
opened an investigation

238
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,912
into missing Stark technology.

239
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,882
Agents wanna know
exactly what was taken...

240
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,984
At least they used
a good picture.

241
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,288
What is happening?

242
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,190
That's great. Thank you.

243
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,959
Well, I have
some good news, Peter.

244
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,293
I don't believe
any of the charges

245
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,662
against you are gonna stick.
Wait, seriously?

246
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,230
I knew it.
Nice.

247
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,865
My God, Mr. Murdock, thank you.

248
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,601
-Thank you, Matt.
-That's amazing.

249
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,935
- You're welcome.
- Perfect.

250
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,570
-However, Mr. Hogan.
-Yes?

251
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,873
The Feds are investigating
that missing technology.

252
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,810
I understand your loyalty
to Mr. Stark and his legacy,

253
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:13,944
but if you were involved--

254
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,679
If I was?
I advise securing a lawyer.

255
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:19,083
I need a lawyer because I'm--?
I thought he was--

256
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,284
You said there's no charge.

257
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,119
I could say
under advisement of counsel,

258
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,321
I refuse to answer
the question respectfully

259
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,990
because the answer
can incriminate me--

260
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,959
It's in Goodfellas. What's the
thing they say in Goodfellas?

261
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,728
I know that's what you think.
Calm down.

262
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,229
Let's hear what
he has to say. Matt?

263
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,965
You're gonna need
a really good lawyer.

264
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,368
You may have dodged
your legal troubles

265
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,602
but things will get much worse.

266
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,739
There is still
the court of public opinion.

267
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:46,612
Murderer! Mysterio forever!

268
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,913
How did you just do that?

269
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,351
I'm a really good lawyer.

270
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,487
We're gonna need
a safer place to live.

271
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,732
Oh. Ah.

272
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,334
How do we--?
How do we--?

273
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,172
Alarm system deactivated.

274
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:18,711
It looks nice.
And this is safe.

275
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:24,682
Welcome to the spiritual oasis.

276
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,450
You like Donkey Kong Jr.?

277
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,518
Hey, man, move!

278
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,852
Stop! Thief!

279
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,288
Move out of the way!
Hey, move, move!

280
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,489
Stop that guy!

281
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,557
Look out!

282
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,491
Stop!

283
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,732
Oh, my God.

284
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:43,701
Hey!

285
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,637
Whoa, what are you doing?
You can't do this anymore.

286
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,205
He's the thief.
You're a child.

287
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,941
Show some respect.
He's not a child.

288
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:51,842
He's 14 years old.

289
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,277
I'm not--
I had a job when I was 14.

290
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,146
-My son is 14. He's a moron.
-Guys, I am not 14 years old.

291
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,615
He's not equipped to make
these kinds of decisions.

292
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:01,285
It's true. Teenagers' brains
aren't fully developed yet.

293
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,620
- He can't even rent a car.
- He doesn't need a car.

294
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:04,888
-He's been to space.
-Thank you.

295
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,658
How do you know they aren't
working together and in cahoots?

296
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,426
Me and this guy?
I don't know this guy.

297
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,228
We don't know
what's in that bag.

298
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,764
We've been in cahoots
the whole time.

299
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,265
Murderer!

300
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,436
Mysterio forever!

301
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,405
Nicky from Jersey City,
you're on the line.

302
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,675
I'm not saying I don't want
to honor the Avengers,

303
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,044
but, you know,
not doing it this way.

304
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,979
Putting the
Captain America shield

305
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,848
on the Statue of Liberty?

306
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,382
Nah, that will look ridiculous.

307
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,119
Leave the Statue
of Liberty alone.

308
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,553
Oh, Happy.

309
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:39,056
Did you send in
your applications yet?

310
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,924
I just finished my MIT one.

311
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,759
-You?
-Same.

312
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,128
Can you imagine if
we both got in? And Ned?

313
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,230
Yeah, but we'd have
to get scholarships

314
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,364
so we could actually go.

315
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,666
You got the scores
and the grades.

316
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,702
You think I'm being
too pragmatic.

317
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,971
No, no, no. Well...

318
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:54,838
Kind of. It's okay.

319
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,874
It's one of my favorite
things about you.

320
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,041
Really?
Yeah.

321
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,077
What are your other
favorite things?

322
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,745
I love your
relentless optimism.

323
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,847
I am a glass-half-full
kind of gal.

324
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,916
I really like how
you're a people person.

325
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,852
I love people.
I love them so much.

326
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:09,586
You like sports.

327
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:10,621
I think the Mets are gonna

328
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,489
go all the way this year.
Really?

329
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,924
What's that noise?

330
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,493
Oh. It's Happy. Look.

331
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:20,499
Gave his room to May
so he's sleeping down here.

332
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,603
I have a weird question. Um...

333
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:30,342
Does any part of you
feel relieved about all of this?

334
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:36,313
Ever since I got bit
by that spider...

335
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:41,251
I've only had one week
where my life has felt normal.

336
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,987
Or kind of normal, I guess.

337
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,291
And...

338
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,024
that was when
you found out.

339
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,227
Because then everyone
that was in my life

340
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,362
that I wanted to know, knew.

341
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,330
And it was perfect.

342
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,402
But now everybody knows and...

343
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:01,373
I am the most famous person
in the entire world.

344
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,640
And I'm still broke.

345
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,213
I'm...

346
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,017
excited to see you tomorrow.

347
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:14,818
Yeah. Me too.

348
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,853
Wrap it up.

349
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,588
You both like each other.
We get it. Hang up.

350
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,557
There's no new ground being
broken. I need my eight hours.

351
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,392
Have you been listening
this whole time?

352
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,528
Hi, Happy.
Not by choice.

353
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,797
MJ says hi.
Hello.

354
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,599
It's back to school, folks.

355
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,167
And in their infinite wisdom,

356
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,902
Mayor Dingus
and the city clown-cil

357
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:36,240
are welcoming back the town's
most notorious costumed killer--

358
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,608
Peter Parker.

359
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,276
Go get them, tiger.

360
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,544
Or should I say "spider"?

361
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:44,314
The crowd has continued
to grow here all morning long

362
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,416
at the Midtown School
of Science...

363
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,485
The crowd seems evenly divided

364
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,054
between supporters
of Spider-Man

365
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,256
and protestors.

366
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,792
MJ! MJ! MJ! We love you!

367
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,595
MJ, are you gonna have
his spider-babies?

368
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,331
Back up. Back up. Back up!

369
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,001
MJ, you know
he's a murderer, right?

370
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,602
Peter. Do a TikTok with me.

371
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,672
-Mysterio forever!
-Do a flip!

372
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,842
-Hey, let's see you and MJ kiss!
-Back off.

373
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:12,643
Who are you?

374
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,478
Ned Leeds.
Spider-Man's best friend.

375
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,779
I'm Peter Parker's
best friend.

376
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,814
You come at my boy,
you come at Flash Thompson.

377
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,117
If you wanna read
about our inspiring friendship,

378
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,985
you can in my new book,
Flashpoint.

379
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:25,656
One spider, two hearts,
a million crazy-ass memories.

380
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,359
Check it out.

381
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,295
Go.
No, I gotta wait--

382
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:31,995
No. Go.

383
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,133
I'll see you inside, okay?

384
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,700
Keep watching Midtown News
all year

385
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,835
as we bring you up close
and personal coverage

386
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:42,506
of Peter fighting
his biggest battle yet,

387
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,777
college admissions.

388
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:53,583
Peter, we would love to welcome
you back to Midtown High,

389
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,252
where we shape heroes.

390
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,754
Yeah, uh-huh. Or murderers.

391
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:58,488
Stop it.

392
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,425
It's an honor
to serve you, sir.

393
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,326
It's not.

394
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,327
Mysterio was right.

395
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,028
Stop. That's all.
Mysterio was right.

396
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,864
Some of the students
put this together for you.

397
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,167
No, you did that.
I helped a little bit.

398
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,637
I tried to stop you so many
times but you powered through.

399
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,772
- He did all of that.
- Did a great job.

400
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,574
I hope you have time
to check it out.

401
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,510
Feel free to walk
or swing through the hallway.

402
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,146
Or crawl on the ceiling
to avoid everybody.

403
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,882
-We all know you can do it.
-I'm just gonna...

404
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:26,750
I know what you did.

405
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,185
Stop. You're
embarrassing yourself.

406
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,020
He's a conspiracy
theorist.

407
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,671
We were lab partners.
Did you know that?

408
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,638
Climb it!

409
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,310
Climb it! Climb it! Climb it!

410
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:12,129
Look at that
sticky bastard go.

411
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:12,896
Freak!

412
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,732
I'm where he gets
all his best ideas.

413
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,701
That's why he calls me
his Spidey mentor.

414
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,573
Peter! Good to see you, bud!
I'll see you later!

415
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,940
Oh, my God, he's so cute!

416
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:27,210
What's it like
being Spider-Man's teacher?

417
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:31,314
Well, Peter's always been
more than a student to me.

418
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:36,820
He's been more like a son.
Who's also my little brother.

419
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,555
So, what do you
think about

420
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,091
these crazy
Mysterio conspiracy theories

421
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,526
that are spreading online?

422
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,528
There's a conspiracy theory
that

423
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,397
Justin Timberlake
was in NSYNC at one time.

424
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,001
And then you look it up,
and, oh, he was in NSYNC.

425
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,002
My ex-wife, for example,

426
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,904
she's been spending
a lot of time online.

427
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,506
And, you know,
the Internet is a wild place

428
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,875
that really beckons
people like her

429
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,577
who are a little lost

430
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,678
and kind of have forgotten

431
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,447
where they came from
and who they are

432
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,516
and that they love someone
very much.

433
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,518
Sometimes you just forget
these things

434
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,556
and you end up in a subreddit,

435
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,958
believing in Mysterio.

436
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,859
Sorry,
what was your question?

437
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:16,726
So you never noticed

438
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,995
he had extraordinary
athletic abilities?

439
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,998
I mean,
it's a science school,

440
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,335
so two push-ups is extraordinary
athletic abilities.

441
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,670
In your book,
you revealed

442
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,139
that the name "Spider-Man"
was your idea.

443
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,908
Were there any others
that you tossed around

444
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,510
before settling on
"Spider-Man"?

445
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,978
Yeah,
there were a few.

446
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,681
You know, "Arachnokid."
"The Bitten."

447
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,249
When I think about it,
there were times

448
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,485
that he was sticking
to the wall,

449
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,521
or he had this stuff
coming out of his wrist.

450
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:48,060
But I didn't really
think much of it. I just...

451
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,894
I've been doing this
a long time.

452
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:51,895
It's just a lot of kids.

453
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:56,066
I noticed that in your book
I'm not mentioned once.

454
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:59,136
No. No,
I'm pretty sure you are.

455
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,670
Uh...

456
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:01,605
I mean, you're...

457
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,673
Whoa,
there are pictures in this?

458
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,209
If that spider had bitten me,

459
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,911
we'd be talking about a
different Spider-Man right now.

460
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:12,182
I think I would have maybe had
a different style costume.

461
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,985
Maybe something
with flared legs, maybe.

462
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:15,819
As sexy as possible.

463
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,288
So, what is
an appropriate text to send

464
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,493
to an ex-girlfriend
in the middle of the night?

465
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,030
You look great, by the way.

466
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,567
Thank you.
You look as beautiful as ever.

467
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,670
What do you say
to the people who claim

468
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,643
that you're not really friends
with Peter Parker?

469
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,446
You know, it hurts.

470
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,850
Because...

471
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,051
You know, I...

472
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:48,685
Tell me:

473
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,655
If the spider
that gave you your powers

474
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,490
were here right now,

475
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,357
what would you say?

476
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,196
Would you say, "Thanks"?
Or, "Thanks for nothing"?

477
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,667
I would say "Thanks."

478
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,832
"For nothing"?

479
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,901
You can catch the rest
of my exclusive interview

480
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:08,471
with Peter Parker
today at lunch, only on MNN.

481
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:12,075
Up next, Lady Liberty is
getting a makeover,

482
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,444
and some of Midtown High's
very own artists share

483
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:17,080
their ideas of what
she should look like.

484
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,649
We'll be right back
after this important message

485
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:23,388
from Principal Morita
about cafeteria safety.

486
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,391
Can we just stay up here
all day?

487
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,061
-It is so crazy down there.
-This one's good.

488
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,562
"Some suggest
that Parker's powers

489
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:36,166
include the male spider's
ability to hypnotize females,

490
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,768
which he used to seduce
Jones-Watson

491
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,205
-into his cult of personality."
-Oh, come on. Stop. Stop.

492
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,943
Yes, my Spider-Lord.

493
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,551
Finally some privacy.

494
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,287
It is so crazy down there.

495
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,955
So I was thinking...

496
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:02,592
when we get into MIT,
we should live together.

497
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,998
-Yeah, for sure.
-Yeah, I'd love that.

498
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,398
This is gonna be us.
Yes.

499
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,333
Minus the Frisbee
and the smiling.

500
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,068
MIT's obviously the dream,

501
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,170
but if we match up
our backup schools,

502
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,239
then either way,
we'll be in Boston.

503
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,408
New school, new town.
I can Spider-Man there.

504
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,610
-They have crime
in Boston, right?
-Yes.

505
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,283
-Wicked crime.
-It'll be like a fresh start.

506
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,750
What's up?

507
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,919
I don't know. I just feel
like, if you don't--

508
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,521
If you expect disappointment,

509
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,624
then you can never really
get disappointed.

510
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,395
Come on.

511
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:40,766
Be a fresh start.
And we'll all be together.

512
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,334
Yeah. No, you're right.
Fresh start.

513
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,671
Yeah.

514
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,606
Fresh start.

515
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,512
First one's here!

516
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,851
It's okay.
It's a backup school.

517
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,187
Peter!

518
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,457
No?

519
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,061
Last one.

520
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,830
MIT?

521
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,536
Uh... Okay.

522
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,080
Okay.

523
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,014
Phew.
Ready?

524
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,684
Jones. I told you to take down
the Halloween decorations.

525
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,419
Actually, that was Sasha so--

526
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,957
Enough attitude.
Just do it.

527
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:40,992
On it.

528
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:42,625
Feel like I'm gonna puke.

529
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:45,328
Don't, because he will
just make me clean it.

530
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,131
This is our only shot.
It's here or nowhere.

531
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,367
Hey. Come on.
Okay. You guys ready?

532
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,470
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, on three.

533
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:56,742
One, two, three.

534
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,332
No.

535
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,733
You?

536
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,335
"In light of recent controversy,

537
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:31,307
we are unable to consider
your application at this time."

538
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,242
This is so not fair.

539
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,078
I mean, this is so not fair.
I didn't do anything wrong.

540
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,046
You guys definitely
didn't do anything wrong.

541
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:42,053
Expect disappointment and
you will never get disappointed.

542
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:45,054
♪ No sleep till ♪

543
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,861
♪ Boston ♪

544
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,098
You guys didn't get in?

545
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,904
Yeah, because we're actually
friends with Spider-Man.

546
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,505
Uh, yeah. I better get going.

547
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:06,075
There's a mixer
for new admissions and--

548
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,177
Sorry, guys.

549
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,913
- Jones, what are you doing?
- Get back to work.

550
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,648
Yeah, I'm coming.

551
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,084
Know what?

552
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,655
I wouldn't change
a thing I did.

553
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,357
Me neither.

554
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,996
Although I do need to show
this letter to my parents.

555
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,601
Um, hi.

556
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,805
Hi?

557
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,472
I'm, uh--

558
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:45,308
The most famous person
in the world.

559
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,678
I know.

560
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,645
Wong. Try not to slip.

561
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:51,249
We don't have
liability insurance.

562
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,251
Is all this
for a holiday party?

563
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:59,856
No. One of the rotunda
gateways connects to Siberia.

564
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,658
A blizzard blasted through.

565
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:06,462
Because someone forgot to cast
a monthly maintenance spell

566
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,497
to keep the seals tight.

567
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,499
That's right, he did,
because he forgot

568
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,801
I now have higher duties.
Higher duties?

569
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:14,170
The Sorcerer Supreme
has higher duties. Yes.

570
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,639
Wait, I thought you were
the Sorcerer Supreme.

571
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,308
No, he got it
on a technicality

572
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,709
because I blipped
for five years.

573
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:23,179
Oh, well, congratulations.
If I'd been here, then--

574
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,213
You'd burn the place down.

575
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,549
You two, no one said
stop shoveling.

576
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,686
So, Peter, to what
do I owe the pleasure?

577
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,755
Right. I'm really sorry
to bother you, sir.

578
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,991
Please. We saved half
the universe together.

579
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,560
Think we're beyond
you calling me "sir."

580
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:38,928
Okay, uh, Stephen.

581
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,364
That feels weird,
but I'll allow it.

582
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:44,968
When...

583
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,837
When Mysterio
revealed my identity...

584
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,841
my entire life got screwed up
and I was wondering--

585
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,077
I don't know
if this would actually work,

586
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,945
but I was wondering if...

587
00:26:55,947 --> 00:27:00,885
maybe you could go back in time
and make it so he never did?

588
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:02,852
Peter...

589
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:05,788
we tampered with the stability
of space-time

590
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,990
to resurrect countless lives.

591
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:10,059
You wanna do it again now
because yours got messy?

592
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:10,994
It's not about me.

593
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:14,063
I mean, this is really hurting
a lot of people.

594
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,366
My Aunt May, Happy,

595
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,667
my best friend,
my girlfriend,

596
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,603
their futures are ruined
just because they know me,

597
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,538
and they've done
nothing wrong.

598
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,976
I am so sorry...

599
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,343
but even if I wanted to...

600
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,682
I don't have
the Time Stone anymore.

601
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,985
That's right.

602
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,889
I'm really sorry
if I wasted your time.

603
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:42,458
No. You didn't.
Just forget about it.

604
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,364
He will. He's very good
at forgetting things.

605
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,633
Wong, you've actually
generated a good idea.

606
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:51,501
What?

607
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,603
The Runes of Kof-Kol.

608
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:54,971
The Runes of Kof-Kol?

609
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,939
It's just a standard
spell of forgetting.

610
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,475
Won't turn back time,
but people will forget

611
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:00,510
you were ever Spider-Man.

612
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,478
Seriously?
No, not seriously.

613
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,280
That spell travels
the dark borders

614
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:06,449
between known
and unknown reality.

615
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,219
It's too dangerous.

616
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,819
We've used it for a lot less.

617
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:12,722
Do you remember the full moon
party at Kamar-Taj?

618
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,826
No.
Exactly.

619
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,764
Come on, Wong.

620
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,101
Hasn't he been through enough?

621
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,275
Just leave me out of this.

622
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,611
Fine.

623
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,880
Fine.

624
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,258
So, what is this place?

625
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,861
The Sanctum's built
at the intersection

626
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:53,329
of cosmic energy currents.

627
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,431
We weren't the first
to seek them out.

628
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:58,668
Some of these walls
are thousands of years old.

629
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:03,272
And they shot an episode of
The Equalizer here in the '80s.

630
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,743
Well, I, um...

631
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,845
really appreciate you
doing this for me, sir.

632
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,415
Don't mention it.

633
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,250
And don't call me "sir."

634
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,152
Right. Sorry.

635
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,789
You ready?

636
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,824
I'm ready.

637
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,962
Nice knowing you, Spider-Man.

638
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,601
Wait, excuse me?

639
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,768
The entire world's
about to forget

640
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,437
that Peter Parker
is Spider-Man.

641
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,905
-Including me.
-Everyone?

642
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,674
Uh, can't some people
still know?

643
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,943
That's not how
the spell works.

644
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,945
And it's very difficult
and dangerous

645
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,180
to change it mid-casting.

646
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,449
So my girlfriend's
gonna forget everything?

647
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,817
Is she even gonna be
my girlfriend?

648
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,353
Was she your girlfriend
because you were Spider-Man?

649
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,856
-I don't know. I really hope no.
-All right, fine.

650
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:57,193
Everyone in the world's
gonna forget you're Spider-Man

651
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,061
except your girlfriend.

652
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:00,897
Thank you so much.

653
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,334
Oh, my God, Ned. Ned.

654
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,802
What is a Ned?

655
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:06,736
He's my best friend

656
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,808
so it's important to me
that Ned knows.

657
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:16,679
Okay, let's not change
the parameters of this spell

658
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,314
any more
while I'm casting it.

659
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,983
Okay, I'm done.
I swear I'm done. I'm done.

660
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,485
But my Aunt May
should really know.

661
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,053
Peter, stop tampering
with the spell.

662
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:26,622
When she found out,
it was really messy.

663
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:30,128
I don't think
I could go through that again.

664
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,094
So my Aunt May?
Yes.

665
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,496
Thank you. Happy?

666
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,330
No, I'm annoyed.

667
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,132
No, it's a nickname.
Harold "Happy" Hogan.

668
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,868
He used to work with Tony Stark,
but then he was...

669
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,739
Could you just stop talking?

670
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,112
Basically everyone that knew

671
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:53,618
I was Spider-Man before
should still know!

672
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,971
Did it work?
No.

673
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,673
You changed my spell six times.

674
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,275
Five times.
You changed my spell.

675
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:22,445
You don't do that. I told you.
And that is why.

676
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,414
That spell was out of control.
If I hadn't shut it down,

677
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,884
something catastrophic
could have happened.

678
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:32,190
-Stephen, listen, I am so--
-Call me "sir."

679
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,293
Sorry, sir.

680
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,360
After everything
we've been through,

681
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:41,664
somehow I always forget
you're just a kid.

682
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,800
Look, Parker, the problem
is not Mysterio.

683
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,903
It's you trying to live
two different lives.

684
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,206
And the longer you do that,
the more dangerous it becomes.

685
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,574
Believe me. I'm so sorry

686
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:55,044
about you and your friends
not getting into college,

687
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:58,347
but if they rejected you
and you tried

688
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,815
to convince them to reconsider,

689
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,887
there's nothing else
you can do.

690
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,956
When you say, "Convince them,"

691
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:10,726
you mean I could have
called them?
Yeah.

692
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,297
I could do that?

693
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,897
You haven't called the...?

694
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,799
I got their letter.
I assumed that was--

695
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,802
I'm sorry.
Are you telling me

696
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:22,939
that you didn't even think to
plead your case with them first

697
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:27,779
before you asked me
to brainwash the entire world?

698
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,483
Well, I mean,
when you put it like that...

699
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,357
Come on, pick up, pick up.

700
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,391
Dude, what? I'm busy.

701
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:44,794
Flash, where's the MIT mixer?
Why?

702
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,195
Because I need
to talk to someone.

703
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:48,831
I'm trying to get Ned and MJ
a second chance at getting in.

704
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,732
What's in it for me?

705
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:52,134
I'm risking a lot
just talking to you.

706
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,503
Okay, I will, um...

707
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:57,840
pick you up and swing you
to school for one week?

708
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:58,741
For a month.

709
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,376
For a week.
Two weeks.

710
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:04,282
Flash, please. Help me.
You know what I want.

711
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,816
Okay, I'll tell everyone
you're my best friend.

712
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,751
Flash, please help me.
Cool, cool, cool.

713
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,486
There's the
assistant vice chancellor.

714
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,088
You can plead your case
with her.

715
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,956
Perfect. Where is she?
She left.

716
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,125
To go where?
To the airport.

717
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,967
Stark network unavailable.

718
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:27,670
Facial recognition unavailable.

719
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,477
Hi.

720
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,347
Yeah, I can see you.

721
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,525
Oh, my God.

722
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,993
-That's Peter Parker.
-Mom.

723
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,695
-Mom, look.
-Mommy.

724
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,832
No, it's Peter Parker.

725
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,741
Hey.

726
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,209
Okay.

727
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,080
Whew.

728
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:19,922
Yeah.
Hi. I'm Peter Parker.

729
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,624
You do know you're
in the street, right?

730
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,859
Yeah, I'm sorry. I really
needed to talk to you

731
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,528
and I know you're
on your way to the airport.

732
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,265
MJ Watson and Ned Leeds are the
two smartest people I've met,

733
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,967
and I'm the dumbest person
because I let them help me,

734
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,969
but if I didn't,
millions would've died,

735
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,705
so please don't let MIT
be dumb like me.

736
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:37,473
MIT is dumb?

737
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,342
No, I'm saying
don't let MIT be dumb.

738
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,812
I mean, like
the dumber version of me

739
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:45,783
that wouldn't have
let them help.

740
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,717
You didn't rehearse that,
did you, Peter?

741
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,821
Basically, what I'm trying to--

742
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:01,699
Why are you running?

743
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:06,402
Oh, my God.

744
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,771
Ma'am, you should get out
of the car.

745
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,609
Everybody get off the bridge!

746
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,276
The door's locked.

747
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,414
Door's-- Hey!

748
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,532
Hello, Peter.

749
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,799
Hi? Do we--? Do I know you?

750
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,834
What have you done
with my machine?

751
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,871
I don't know what you're
talking about. What machine?

752
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:45,574
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

753
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:46,342
It's gone.

754
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,177
Listen, sir,
if you stop smashing cars,

755
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,647
we can work together and I can
help you find your machine.

756
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,784
You want to play games?

757
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,286
Catch.

758
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,038
It's okay. You guys are good.
You're safe. Get out.

759
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,611
You think your fancy new suit's
gonna save you?

760
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,858
Should've killed
your little girlfriend

761
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,695
when I had the chance.

762
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,364
What did you just say?

763
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,336
Looks like we got competition.

764
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:07,525
Peter! Help!

765
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,313
Don't worry, ma'am! I'm coming!

766
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,617
Peter!

767
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:02,678
Ma'am, just stay calm.

768
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,979
Just take
a deep breath.

769
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,817
Are you okay?
No!

770
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:11,289
I promise, I've got this
all under control.

771
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,762
Suit compromised.

772
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,497
Nanotechnology.

773
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:24,033
Ah, you've outdone yourself,
Peter.

774
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,677
I underestimated you.

775
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,346
But now you die.

776
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,227
You're not Peter Parker.

777
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:55,633
I am so confused right now.

778
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:58,634
What's happening?

779
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,971
New device detected.

780
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,375
Pairing new device.

781
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:11,115
You don't listen to him.
You listen to me.

782
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,988
Hey.

783
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,261
Whoa.

784
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,368
Hey. Hey!

785
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,203
Listen to me.

786
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,640
No, not him.
Me.

787
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,912
Ma'am, you okay?

788
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:47,116
Come on, you can still
make your flight.

789
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,452
Peter.

790
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,652
You're a hero.

791
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,721
No. Well, I'm-- No, I'm--

792
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,791
I'm gonna talk to Admissions
about your friends.

793
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,227
And I'm gonna talk
to them about you.

794
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,129
But, ma'am,
this isn't about me.

795
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:04,833
I am going to talk to them
about your friends and you.

796
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,168
Okay?
Really?

797
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,003
And if you keep
your noses clean,

798
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:09,138
maybe you'll have a fair shot.

799
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,074
Here. Get out of the way.
Let me get that man.

800
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,042
Hey! You! I see you.
Come here!

801
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:17,381
That was not okay.
Unbelievable.

802
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,581
Who are--?

803
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,482
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

804
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,584
Until you stop
trying to kill me,

805
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,452
I'm in control, buddy,

806
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,587
of this whole
tentacle situation

807
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,189
you got going on here,
okay?

808
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,625
Now, who are you?
What is going--?

809
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:40,438
No.

810
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,612
Osborn?

811
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,167
Doctor--?

812
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,912
Be careful
what you wish for, Parker.

813
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,047
Let me out of here!

814
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,349
Can you please explain to me
what is going on?

815
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,017
That little spell
that you botched

816
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,586
where you wanted
everyone to forget

817
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:31,954
that Peter Parker's
Spider-Man,

818
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,255
it started pulling in
everyone

819
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,890
who knows
Peter Parker's Spider-Man

820
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:38,460
from every universe
into this one.

821
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:41,396
-From every universe?
-Who are you? And where am I?

822
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,365
I think it's better
we don't engage

823
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:44,566
with them because,
frankly,

824
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,668
the Multiverse
is a concept about which

825
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,371
we know frighteningly little.

826
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,540
The Multiverse is real?

827
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,875
This shouldn't even be possible.

828
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,310
-I thought you stopped the spel.
-No, I contained it.

829
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,446
It would appear
a few of them squeaked through.

830
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,815
After you left, I detected
an otherworldly presence.

831
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:03,785
I pursued it into the sewers,
where I found that...

832
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:06,388
slimy green son of a gun.

833
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,957
Spell? As in magic?

834
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,826
What is this,
a birthday party?

835
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,562
Who is this clown?
What is this madness?

836
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:16,098
Watch this.
Do you know a Peter Parker

837
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,200
-who's Spider-Man?
-Yes.

838
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,935
-Is that him?
-No.

839
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:21,505
See?

840
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,105
Okay, here's what we gotta do.

841
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,741
I don't know how many
visitors we've got--

842
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:28,377
I saw another one
on the bridge.

843
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,980
He was like a
flying green elf.

844
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:34,116
He sounds jolly.
Start with him.

845
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:35,183
I need you
to capture them,

846
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:36,985
bring them here
while I figure out

847
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,320
how to get them back
before

848
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,689
they destroy
the fabric of reality,

849
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:43,191
or worse, Wong finds out.

850
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,060
Uh, Doctor Strange?

851
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:45,928
What?

852
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,897
My friends and I just got a
second chance to get into MIT,

853
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:52,134
and if the school sees me
fighting these crazy monsters--

854
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,769
Hey, watch your mouth.
I'm sorry but--

855
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:57,207
Are you seriously
still talking about college?

856
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:05,115
-Hey, what did you just do?
-This.

857
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:07,783
Hey, you can't just--

858
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:11,486
How did you do that?

859
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:14,091
Lots of birthday parties.

860
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,432
Hey.

861
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:23,799
Whoa.

862
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,701
One shot,
send them here, move on.

863
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,502
You're welcome. Get to work.

864
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:28,203
Sir?

865
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:30,572
Now what?

866
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:33,942
I know this is my mess,
and I swear to you I'll fix it,

867
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,080
but I'm gonna need help.

868
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:37,913
Whoa!

869
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:41,383
I can't believe
I'm in the Sanctum Sanctorum.

870
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:42,551
Neither can I.

871
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:45,087
So how did you know
you were a man of magic?

872
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:47,589
Because my nana says
that we have it in our family,

873
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:49,958
and I get these tinglings
in my hands--

874
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,159
Talk to your physician.

875
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:52,494
- Peter.
- Hey.

876
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,129
-Hey. Hey.
-Hey. Hey.

877
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,397
Sorry for dragging you
into this.

878
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:58,467
Help me find these guys.
You don't have to apologize.

879
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,769
You got us a second shot
at MIT. It's fine.

880
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,205
So how did the bad guys
get here?

881
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:06,274
We screwed up a spell
trying to get you into college.

882
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,909
Wait. What?
You did it with magic?

883
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:10,245
I thought it was
the MIT lady you saved.

884
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:11,346
No, that was after.

885
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:12,681
Let's just focus
on the good news, okay?

886
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,149
No, let's just focus
on the bad news.

887
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:18,487
As of now, you have detected
zero multiversal trespassers,

888
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:23,392
so get on your phones,
scour the Internet, and...

889
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,293
Scooby-Doo this shit.

890
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:27,396
You're telling us
what to do even though

891
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,264
it was your spell
that got screwed up,

892
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:31,500
meaning that all this
is kind of your mess.

893
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,236
I know a couple of
magic words myself,

894
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:37,307
starting with
the word "please."

895
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:42,644
Please Scooby-Doo this shit.

896
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:45,347
You can work in the Undercroft.

897
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,185
The Undercroft?

898
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,091
Badass.

899
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:02,964
About this whole spell thing--
It's totally okay.

900
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:05,367
Wait, really?
Yeah. I mean, I get it.

901
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:09,838
You were just trying
to fix things, and so...

902
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,374
Maybe just run it by us
next time, you know?

903
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,510
That way, when you're thinking,
"I'm about to do something

904
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,913
that could break the universe,"

905
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:22,284
we could, like, help you
workshop something or...

906
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:25,556
brainstorm ideas.

907
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:28,592
Deal.

908
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:30,525
Ned?

909
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:34,663
Oh, dude, I don't care.
It's seriously not a big deal.

910
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:36,665
Um, oh!

911
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,236
A torture rack.

912
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,771
That is a Pilates machine.

913
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:43,905
That is--
The crypt.

914
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,941
Okay, so we get
the rest of the guys,

915
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:48,543
you zap them, Doctor Magic
will send them back,

916
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:50,045
and when we get into MIT,

917
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,481
round of stale doughnuts,
my treat.

918
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:54,216
Let's catch
some Multiverse men.

919
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:57,319
Hey! Who the hell
are these two?

920
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:59,454
My friends. This is MJ.
Hey.

921
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:00,722
And this is Ned.
Hello.

922
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:03,125
Uh, I'm sorry,
what was your name again?

923
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,562
Dr. Otto Octavius.

924
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,500
Wait, no, seriously,
what's your actual name?

925
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:12,868
Oh, is that

00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:15,664
No, no, no. May. We gotta
find these guys first.

952
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,099
Well, finish your mission,
and then come by.

953
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:20,468
We're having
a canned food drive.

954
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,470
- That could work.
- I got one.

May, I gotta go.
Okay.

956
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:25,907
I mean, you can take
the guy out of the chair,

957
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:28,376
but you can't take
the chair out of the guy.

958
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,545
What'd you find?
There's a...

959
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:33,748
A disturbance near
a military research facility

960
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,649
outside of the city,

961
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:36,551
and witnesses say
that they saw

962
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:39,223
a monster flying
through the air.

963
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:42,224
It's gotta be the guy
I saw on the bridge, right?

964
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:44,194
That's impossible.

965
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:47,865
You know him, don't you?

966
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:51,299
On the bridge,
you said his name.

967
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,568
Norman Osborn.

968
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:58,340
Brilliant scientist.
Military research.

969
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:01,243
But he was greedy, misguided.

970
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:06,481
What happened to him?
We tire of your questions, boy!

971
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:08,917
Okay, um...

972
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:11,453
I gotta go. Where am I going?

973
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:12,956
It can't be him.

974
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:15,457
Why?

975
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:19,863
Because Norman Osborn
died years ago.

976
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,531
So either we saw someone else...

977
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:29,304
or you're flying out into
the darkness to fight a ghost.

978
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:56,433
Keep an eye out on the trees.
We don't know where this guy is.

979
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:02,372
I genuinely don't know how you
do this without throwing up.

980
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:20,588
Did you guys see that?

981
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,524
Um, no.

982
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,995
It's-It's really dark.

983
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,775
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

984
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,147
What-What's happening?

985
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,018
Peter, what is it?

986
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,819
Are you getting
the tingle thing?

987
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,122
Is the tingle happening?
Is your tingle tingling?

988
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:05,300
- Are you guys seeing this?
- Yeah.

989
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:06,234
Osborn?

990
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:08,903
No. He was green.
This guy's blue.

991
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:13,176
You wouldn't happen to be from
another universe, would you?

992
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,576
What's he doing?

993
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,611
I don't know.
Looks like he's charging.

994
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:19,349
I don't like this.
Just web him.

995
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,223
Whoa!

996
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:33,995
- Go left! Left, dude, left!
- Left! Go! Left! Yes!

997
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:36,131
- What are you talking about?
- Right.

998
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:38,533
Go to the right! Right!
Right! He means right.

999
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:42,906
-Don't listen to him.
-Guys, this is not helping!

1000
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:52,113
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What happened? Peter? Peter.

1001
00:50:59,056 --> 00:50:59,754
Whoa.

1002
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:04,559
Peter, it's me, Flint Marko.
You remember?

1003
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,161
I'm Peter,
but I'm not your Peter.

1004
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,163
What do you mean,
you're not my Peter?

1005
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:09,564
What the hell is going on?

1006
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:12,067
I'll explain, but first,
can you help me?

1007
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,701
-Okay.
-You try to surround him,

1008
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:17,107
and I'll pull the plug.
All right, let's go!

1009
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:34,255
I can't hold him much longer.

1010
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,393
I got it, I got it!

1011
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,553
Different Peter. Weird.

1012
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:09,559
Thanks. Sorry.
Don't worry about it.

1013
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:19,734
I got my body back.

1014
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,035
Hey, um...

1015
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:23,104
This is gonna sound
really crazy,

1016
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:24,806
but this isn't your universe.

1017
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,274
Another universe?

1018
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,342
Uh-huh.
What?

1019
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:29,310
That's what I was feeling.

1020
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,115
The power, it's different.

1021
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:34,851
I like it.

1022
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:37,552
Easy, buddy.

1023
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,821
It's actually my fault
that you're here.

1024
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,925
Like, the universe or the woods?

1025
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:44,792
I hate the woods.

1026
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:46,594
I meant the universe, sir.

1027
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,396
So, what, y'all
just gonna stand here

1028
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:50,365
and act like I ain't
butt-ass naked?

1029
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,901
I am.
No, no.

1030
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,271
I, uh...

1031
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:08,116
What was that?
What did you just do to him?

1032
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,051
-No. It's okay.
-Did you kill him?

1033
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,153
I can explain everything.
Trust me.

1034
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:13,388
Please just trust me.

1035
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:16,059
I don't trust you.
I don't know you.

1036
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,163
What is this?

1037
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:22,564
You picked the wrong side.

1038
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:26,903
Connors?

1039
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:29,704
Wait. You know this creature?

1040
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:34,309
No, no, no.
Not a creature. A man.

1041
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:35,176
The same universes.

1042
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:37,579
Dr. Curt Connors.
He was a scientist

1043
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,614
at Oscorp when I worked there.

1044
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:41,449
A brilliant scientist.

1045
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:42,850
Until he turned himself
into a lizard.

1046
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:45,420
Then he tried to turn
the whole city into lizards.

1047
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:47,722
-It was crazy.
-It wasn't crazy, Max.

1048
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,091
It was the next step
in human evolution.

1049
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:52,160
-The dinosaur can talk. Right.
-Lizard.

1050
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,229
Speaking of which
what happened to you?

1051
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,497
Last I recall,
you had bad teeth,

1052
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,066
glasses and a comb-over.

1053
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,301
Did you get a makeover?

1054
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:03,171
You know I can give you
a real makeover.

1055
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:04,339
Let me guess, into a lizard?

1056
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:07,075
Exactly.
Would you two just shut up?

1057
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,776
Where are we?
It's complicated.

1058
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:11,479
A wizard's dungeon.
Wizard's dungeon?

1059
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:13,381
There's no real way
to sugarcoat that.

1060
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:15,683
It's literally the dungeon
of a wizard.

1061
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,852
You can keep your magic.

1062
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:21,591
I want a taste of that
new energy I just felt.

1063
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,995
Oh, Peter, hey.
Did those guys come through yet?

1064
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:29,163
There should be
an electric guy and a sand guy.

1065
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:31,733
Yeah, they're all here
and locked up.

1066
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,635
Perfect. I'm gonna just
stay here for a bit

1067
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:35,003
and try and fix
some of this damage

1068
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:36,771
so they don't blame it
on me again.

1069
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,841
Okay.
But, hey, I, uh...

1070
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,977
I couldn't do any of this
without you, so thank you.

1071
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:44,078
Yeah, of course.

1072
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,780
Hey, ask him if this is,

1073
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,715
like, a tree monster
or, like,

1074
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:49,684
a scientist
that turned into a tree.

1075
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:53,957
- It's just a tree, man.
- Just a tree.

1076
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:14,177
- Coward.
- We have a new world to conquer.

1077
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,078
You make me sick.

1078
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,213
Leave me alone, please.

1079
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:22,317
Hiding in the shadows.

1080
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,519
Hiding from who you truly are.

1081
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:28,858
No.
You can't escape yourself.

1082
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:47,108
Hey, May.
Hey, Peter. I'm at work, and...

1083
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:51,045
one of the guys you're
looking for just walked in.

1084
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,955
May? Where's May?

1085
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:02,359
Thank you.

1086
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:06,463
May.

1087
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,564
Ah, hey, here he is.

1088
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:13,536
Norman, this is my nephew.

1089
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,804
Norman Osborn?
I thought that you were--

1090
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:21,342
I saw Spider-Man
in an ad for this place.

1091
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:24,178
And I thought
he could help me.

1092
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,279
But you're not him.

1093
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:28,049
Wait, so you want
Spider-Man's help?

1094
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,253
He just wandered in.

1095
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:35,058
I didn't know
where else to go.

1096
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:38,695
Someone's living in my house.

1097
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,198
Oscorp doesn't exist.

1098
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,135
My son...

1099
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:52,442
Sometimes I'm not myself.

1100
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,276
I'm someone else.

1101
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:57,478
Mm-hm.
And every time he's in control,

1102
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,814
I can't remember.
Who? Who's in control?

1103
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:01,582
And now I'm here--
Who's in control?

1104
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:05,019
I don't know what's going on.
Okay, it's okay.

1105
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:09,023
And I don't--
Doesn't make sense.

1106
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,358
He's lost.

1107
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:15,532
And I don't mean just in
the cosmos. I mean in his mind.

1108
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,734
Are they all like this?

1109
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:20,802
Yeah.
Yeah?

1110
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:22,336
They all have their own

1111
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:23,704
mental or physical issues.

1112
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:27,508
Oh, well, he needs help
and maybe they all do.

1113
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:31,245
Wait, you don't mean--?
No, May, this isn't my problem.

1114
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:33,781
Peter, not your problem? Hmm?

1115
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:37,118
May. Their chance
of getting help is way better

1116
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,153
back where they came from.

1117
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:40,354
Sending them home,

1118
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:42,723
that's the best thing
we can do for them.

1119
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:46,029
For them? Or for yourself?

1120
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:50,998
Look around you.
This is what we do.

1121
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,571
We help people.
This is what's best for them.

1122
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:58,441
Trust me.

1123
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:05,213
I'm now joined by
supervisor Walter Burke,

1124
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:08,115
who was at the scene
of tonight's disturbance.

1125
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:11,452
Mr. Burke, you're saying
you saw Spider-Man,

1126
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:12,487
with your own eyes,

1127
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,956
destroying multiple power lines?

1128
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,792
Uh... Yes. Yes, sir, he did.

1129
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:18,759
There you have it, folks.

1130
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:21,295
Firsthand,
from an unimpeachable witness,

1131
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:24,932
the Teen Terror attacking
our electrical grid.

1132
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:28,035
Yeah, he was talking
to the Dirt Man.

1133
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:28,836
Beg your pardon?

1134
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,805
Yeah, he was talking
to the Dirt Man

1135
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:32,306
before they worked together

1136
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:34,308
to make the Power Monster
disappear

1137
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,511
with what appeared to be
a sparkle web.

1138
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,980
All right. Yep.
Thank you very much.

1139
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:40,014
Well, that...

1140
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:42,283
We'll have to circle back

1141
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:43,651
and confirm this, folks.

1142
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:44,719
I'll talk to my producer

1143
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:48,256
to see if we can find out
what's in Mr. Burke's thermos.

1144
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:53,094
But the fact remains,
Spider-Man is a menace.

1145
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:55,530
We'll be right back
after a brief word

1146
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,532
from Daily Bugle Supplements.

1147
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,401
The only other daily fix
you need.

1148
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:03,072
And we're out.

1149
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,209
What?

1150
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:09,710
I got eyes on him.

1151
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,279
He's with his aunt
and some guy.

1152
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,848
You sure?
They're leaving the shelter.

1153
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:16,019
Okay. Don't lose him.

1154
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:29,263
Thanks, May.
Hope to see you again.

1155
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:33,870
Hey. He trusts you. So do I.

1156
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:37,772
Thanks for cleaning my suit.

1157
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:39,742
I'll see you later.

1158
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,778
-Um, guys, this is Mr. Osborn.
-Hey, it's "doctor."

1159
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:46,581
Sorry. Um, Dr. Osborn,
these are my friends.

1160
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,115
This is Ned and MJ.

1161
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:52,789
Mary Jane?
It's Michelle Jones, actually.

1162
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,959
Fascinating.

1163
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:02,065
Do you think
there are other Ned Leedses?

1164
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:16,779
Octavius?

1165
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:21,749
Osborn?

1166
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:25,853
What-- What happened to you?
What happened to...?

1167
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:29,256
You're the walking corpse.
What do you mean?

1168
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:32,059
You died, Norman.

1169
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:34,030
Years ago.

1170
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:35,529
You're insane.

1171
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:38,966
God, I love it here.
What are you talking about?

1172
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,035
He's standing right there.
He's not--

1173
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:43,971
Dead. They both died,

1174
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:46,509
fighting Spider-Man.

1175
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:50,778
It was all over the news.

1176
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:55,816
Green Goblin, impaled by
the glider you flew around on.

1177
01:00:55,818 --> 01:01:00,354
And a couple of years later,
you, Doc Ock,

1178
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:02,757
drowned in the river
with your machine.

1179
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:04,191
That's nonsense.

1180
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:08,329
Spider-Man was trying
to stop my fusion reactor,

1181
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,764
so I stopped him.

1182
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:14,804
I had him by the throat,
and then I...

1183
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:20,641
- And then I was here.
- Ah, please.

1184
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:23,978
Let me tell you something.
I was whupping Spider-Man's ass.

1185
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,747
He'll tell you.
And then he caused an overload.

1186
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:28,716
I was stuck in the grid,
absorbing data.

1187
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:31,952
I was about to turn
into pure energy, and then...

1188
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:33,788
And then, uh...

1189
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:36,590
And then-- Oh, shit.

1190
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:41,597
I was about to die.
Max, do you know? Do I die?

1191
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,467
Oh, great.
You caught another one.

1192
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:49,236
No, wait, Strange.
He's not dangerous.

1193
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,376
It's okay. Um...

1194
01:01:55,111 --> 01:01:56,043
What is that?

1195
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,879
It's an ancient relic.
The Macchina di Kadavus.

1196
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,548
I trapped
your corrupted spell inside,

1197
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,717
and once I finish
the proper ritual,

1198
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,684
it'll reverse the spell

1199
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:06,754
and send these guys
back to their universes.

1200
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:09,156
And then what? We perish?

1201
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:11,125
No. No, thanks.
I'll pass on that.

1202
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:14,395
Let me out of here. Peter!

1203
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:19,500
Strange, we can't
send them back. Not yet.

1204
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:21,068
Why?

1205
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,871
Well, some of these guys
are gonna die.

1206
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:27,944
Parker, it's their fate.

1207
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:31,247
Come on, Strange, have a heart.

1208
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:34,615
In the grand calculus
of the Multiverse,

1209
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:39,756
their sacrifice means infinitely
more than their lives.

1210
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:47,194
I'm sorry, kid.

1211
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:50,633
If they die, they die.

1212
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,148
Peter!

1213
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:19,493
Don't.

1214
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:24,198
Dude, what are you doing?
Peter, you gotta go. Go, go.

1215
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,469
Okay.
Get out of here.

1216
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:30,504
This is why I never had kids.

1217
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:46,122
Give me the box.
No.

1218
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,191
Whoa!

1219
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:05,306
Oh, my God, I'm dead.
You're not dead,

1220
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:08,242
you've just been separated
from your physical form.

1221
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:10,644
My physical-- What?

1222
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:13,781
-How are you doing that?
-I have no idea.

1223
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:16,584
You should not
be able to do that.

1224
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:18,988
This feels amazing.

1225
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,965
That's one of the coolest
things that's happened to me,

1226
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:33,202
but don't ever do that again.

1227
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,075
Wha-- Hey! Get off of me!

1228
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:07,935
♪ La, la ♪

1229
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:12,072
♪ Tis the season
To be jolly... ♪

1230
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:31,692
What is this place?
The Mirror Dimension,

1231
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:33,896
where I'm in control.

1232
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:44,438
Strange, stop. Can we
please just talk about this?

1233
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,741
Parker, don't you realize
that in the Multiverse

1234
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:50,110
there are an infinite number
of people

1235
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,146
who know Peter Parker
is Spider-Man?

1236
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:54,982
And if that spell gets loose,
they're all coming here.

1237
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:58,652
I know, I get it, but we can't
just send them home to die.

1238
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:00,487
It's their fate.

1239
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:01,422
You can't change that

1240
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:03,357
any more than you could
change who they are.

1241
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:07,494
But what if we could? What if
we could change their fate?

1242
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:10,533
Whoa! Oh, what are you doing?

1243
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:17,506
I'm not giving you the-- Whoa!

1244
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:21,077
Whoa! Whoa!

1245
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:29,919
Give me that back.

1246
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:51,839
Wait a minute.
Is that an Archimedean spiral?

1247
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,574
The Mirror Dimension
is just geometry?

1248
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:56,979
You're great at geometry.
You can do geometry.

1249
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,646
Square the radius.
Divide by pi.

1250
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:02,950
Plot points along the curve.
It's over, Parker.

1251
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:06,322
I'll come pick you up
when it's done.

1252
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:09,490
Hey, Strange.

1253
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:12,459
You know
what's cooler than magic?

1254
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:18,401
Math.
Don't do this.

1255
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:23,303
Ow.
I'm sorry, sir, but...

1256
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,245
...I have to try.

1257
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,981
-What happened?
-I fought with Strange and won.

1258
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:36,683
-What?
-Look, I stole his ring thing.

1259
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:39,553
I was swinging through the city,
and then I went through

1260
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,889
this massive mirror thing,
and then I was back in--

1261
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,157
Where is he?
He's trapped,

1262
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:47,194
but I'm not sure for how long.
You could have left us to die.

1263
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:48,495
Why didn't you?

1264
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:50,699
Because that's not who he is.

1265
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:54,835
I think I can help you guys.

1266
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:58,305
If I can fix what happened
to you, then when you go back,

1267
01:07:58,307 --> 01:07:59,373
things will be different,

1268
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,341
and you might not die
fighting Spider-Man.

1269
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:03,477
What do you mean fix us?
Our technology is advanced--

1270
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:09,318
I can help you. You know, I'm
something of a scientist myself.

1271
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:12,586
Octavius knows what I can do.

1272
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:15,456
Fix? You mean like a dog?

1273
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,423
I refuse.

1274
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:17,925
I can't promise
you guys anything,

1275
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,895
but at least this way, you get
to go home and have a chance.

1276
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:23,397
A second chance.

1277
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:24,998
Come on,
isn't that worth trying?

1278
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,036
Trust me, Peter,
when you try to fix people,

1279
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:31,905
there are always consequences.

1280
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:33,474
I mean, you don't have to come.

1281
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:35,909
I also didn't know
that you could talk.

1282
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:36,944
But if you stay here,

1283
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,645
you're gonna have to deal
with the wizard.

1284
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:43,584
Ah, so we go along or die.
Not much of a choice, is it?

1285
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:46,720
-I just wanna go home.
-Well, I, myself,

1286
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:47,654
don't wanna be killed,

1287
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:51,291
especially by a guy dressed
like Dungeons & Dragons,

1288
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,329
so, what's your plan?

1289
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,799
I have it all under control.

1290
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,901
What are we gonna do
about this thing?

1291
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:03,904
Uh, well, we need to find
somewhere safe for it, right?

1292
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:05,839
-Yeah, sure. You gotta take it.
-Wait, what?

1293
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:08,208
If something bad happens,
you just push this,

1294
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:11,111
-and then it's all over.
-We're not gonna leave you.

1295
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:13,413
You can't. It's dangerous.
You've done enough.

1296
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:16,016
-We're in this together.
-I know we're in this together,

1297
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:18,252
but I can't do this
if you're in danger.

1298
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:22,124
Okay? So for me, MJ,
please just take this.

1299
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,860
-Please.
-Fine.

1300
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:27,895
-Thank you.
-But, Peter,

1301
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:30,764
if I don't hear from you,
I'm pressing the button.

1302
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:34,001
-Sure.
-Okay. And I will do it.

1303
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,769
Yeah, we all believe you,
Michelle.

1304
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:38,839
No way that's his girlfriend.
No way.

1305
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,910
-She'll do it.
-Absolutely, she will.

1306
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:46,146
-Okay. See you later.
-Be safe.

1307
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:47,983
-You too.
-Okay.

1308
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:51,086
Whoa.

1309
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:53,222
Okay.

1310
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,892
-Be careful, okay?
-Yeah. You too.

1311
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,935
So, uh...

1312
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:08,771
who's coming with me?

1313
01:10:12,174 --> 01:10:13,507
Well, I'm in.

1314
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:16,777
But if this goes sideways...

1315
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:20,349
I'm gonna fry you
from the inside out.

1316
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:34,094
My client has nothing to do
with the missing technology.

1317
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:37,531
He's a law-abiding citizen.
He has nothing to hide.

1318
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:38,365
That's right.

1319
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:53,146
Where's Connors?

1320
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:54,581
He wants to stay in the truck.

1321
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,216
Okay.
Mr. Hogan,

1322
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:58,087
is there
something wrong?

1323
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:00,923
Happy.

1324
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:04,391
Stop sweating.

1325
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:06,159
How do you do that?

1326
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:07,361
Yeah?
I feel kind of bad

1327
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:11,800
using Happy's place like this.
No, no, no. He'll get over it.

1328
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:14,101
New Yorkers

1329
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,837
oppose the renovation...
Oh, sorry.

1330
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:20,540
So this is your plan, Peter, hm?
No lab, no facilities?

1331
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:23,543
Just performing miracles
in a condominium, hm?

1332
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:24,978
What, you gonna cook us
some cures

1333
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,813
and some frozen burritos
in a microwave?

1334
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:30,183
I could go for a burrito.
He's gonna kill us all.

1335
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:32,119
Well, let's hope not.

1336
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,121
-You're up first, Doc.
-What?

1337
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,923
Hey, I told you,
I don't need fixing.

1338
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:38,625
I don't need fixing.

1339
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:41,461
Especially by a teenager
using scraps

1340
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:42,863
from a bachelor's junk drawer.

1341
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:46,266
Nah, nah, nah.
He got something back there.

1342
01:11:46,268 --> 01:11:49,471
I can feel it.
That weird energy.

1343
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:51,605
What the hell is that?

1344
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:52,839
It's a fabricator.

1345
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:57,477
It can analyze, design,
construct basically anything.

1346
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:00,480
I thought that was
the tanning bed Happy broke.

1347
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:04,787
Look at that.

1348
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:13,629
He's gonna kill us all.

1349
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:23,170
Whoa. What's going on there?

1350
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:25,539
So the chip in the back
of Doc's neck

1351
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:28,275
was designed to protect
his brain from the AI system

1352
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:29,643
that's controlling
these tentacles,

1353
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:33,714
but if you look here...
the chip is fried.

1354
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:36,550
So rather than him being
in control of the tentacles,

1355
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:38,285
the tentacles are now
in control of him.

1356
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:43,790
Which, I guess, explains why
he is so miserable all the time.

1357
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:47,928
But, if you look here,
if I can introduce self--

1358
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:51,633
Self-healing
composite circuitry.

1359
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:53,333
Exactly.

1360
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:56,002
So, theoretically, I mean,
if this were to work,

1361
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:58,741
he would go back
to the way he was.

1362
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,350
Thirsty?

1363
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,819
Well, yes, I am thirsty.

1364
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:14,855
Fresh water or salt?

1365
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:17,860
You know,
because you're an octopus.

1366
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,763
What?

1367
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:23,565
Fresh water it is.

1368
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,565
Look at this place.

1369
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:28,602
And all the possibilities.
What, this condo?

1370
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:32,239
Yeah, yeah, the condo. I love
the whole open floor plan. No.

1371
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:35,542
No, man,
I'm talking about the world.

1372
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:38,547
I kind of like who I am here.

1373
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:42,349
And all that power back there...

1374
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:44,418
I could be so much more.

1375
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,786
So why'd you come along?

1376
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:48,889
I have a daughter,
and I want to see her.

1377
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:50,724
But he's not gonna
send anyone home

1378
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:54,961
till he's finished his little
science project back there.

1379
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:56,163
You trust him?

1380
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:58,267
I don't trust anyone.

1381
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,867
How'd you end up
like that anyway?

1382
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:02,302
Oh...

1383
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:03,837
the place where I worked at,

1384
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:06,339
they were experimenting
with electricity

1385
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:09,643
created by living organisms,
and then, uh...

1386
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:11,912
I fell into
a vat of electric eels.

1387
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:15,682
You're kidding.
I fell into a supercollider.

1388
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:16,983
Damn.

1389
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:19,688
Gotta be careful
where you fall.

1390
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,291
Remarkable.

1391
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:26,261
The technology and you.

1392
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:30,664
When all this is over,
if you need a job

1393
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:36,136
and you're willing to commute
to another universe...

1394
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:43,643
It worked. That totally worked.

1395
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:46,880
I got it. I did it.
Uh, will you send him up?

1396
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:48,650
Here we go.

1397
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:50,250
Sorry.
Hold on, Doc.

1398
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:52,819
Oh, will these humiliations
never cease?

1399
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:56,389
You, keep your science fair
project away from me!

1400
01:14:56,391 --> 01:14:57,491
It'll work. Have faith.

1401
01:14:57,493 --> 01:15:01,361
Says the reckless fool who
turned himself into a monster.

1402
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:04,264
Please stop moving your head.

1403
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:07,503
Hold still.
Don't you dare.

1404
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,241
Ugh! I swear,
when I get out of this,

1405
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:16,877
we're gonna rip you a new--

1406
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:22,417
Doc?

1407
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:29,224
Doc?

1408
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:32,194
Doc?

1409
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:34,661
Dr. Octav--

1410
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:42,671
It's so quiet.

1411
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:49,545
Those voices inside my head...

1412
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:55,884
I'd almost forgotten.

1413
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:58,353
Otto.

1414
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:01,590
Yes. Norman.

1415
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:08,897
It's me.

1416
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:12,467
Would you look at that.

1417
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:35,722
I'm grateful, dear boy. Truly.

1418
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:37,891
Yeah, you're welcome.

1419
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:39,025
How can I help?

1420
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:41,361
This is Peter. Leave a message.

1421
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:44,364
Uh, yeah, Peter, this is Happy.

1422
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:45,899
I accessed my doorbell camera.

1423
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:48,001
Who are those guys, huh?
Is that a cyborg?

1424
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:50,370
You bring a cyborg
with robot legs into my house?

1425
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:54,209
Was one of the guys made of mud?
What's going on? Call me.

1426
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,584
How does it feel, Norman?

1427
01:17:04,586 --> 01:17:07,956
You're about
to become whole again.

1428
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:11,458
No more darker half.

1429
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,961
Just you.

1430
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:15,330
Just me.

1431
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:25,474
Okay, um...

1432
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:29,409
It just goes right here. This...

1433
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:30,877
That should be
drawing power now.

1434
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:32,612
I'm gonna come back
in a second to check,

1435
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:34,981
but keep an eye on the lights.
When they're all green,

1436
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:37,817
it means the electricity
in your body's dissipated.

1437
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:38,985
Well, not all
of the electricity.

1438
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:41,855
You need electricity
for your brain to function.

1439
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:43,189
Your nervous system is...

1440
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:46,826
I'm not really sure why I'm
explaining electricity to you.

1441
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:48,762
-Yeah, can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

1442
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:52,134
Are these your Legos?

1443
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:55,637
Uh, I gotta go. I'll be back.

1444
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:03,710
- Something feels off.
- What do you mean?

1445
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:05,879
I don't like this.
Leave it alone.

1446
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:10,617
The sooner you guys get through
this, the sooner we go home.

1447
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:20,493
Well, where is he?
Uh, he's inside.

1448
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:21,928
And yet here we are, outside.

1449
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:23,997
Did you not hear me say,
"Don't lose him?"

1450
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,132
I want incriminating footage
of Spider-Man.

1451
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:28,568
I called Damage Control.
They're on their way.

1452
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:29,536
And so it begins.

1453
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:32,708
...place is about to be
swarming with cops.

1454
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:53,061
Peter?

1455
01:18:53,795 --> 01:18:55,731
What's wrong?

1456
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:58,465
I don't know.

1457
01:18:58,467 --> 01:18:59,265
May?

1458
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:06,908
What is it, Peter?

1459
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,584
What's happening?

1460
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:24,459
Why are you
looking at me like that?

1461
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:43,543
That's some neat trick,
that sense of yours.

1462
01:19:43,545 --> 01:19:47,981
Norman?
Norman's on sabbatical, honey.

1463
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:50,986
The hell?
The Goblin.

1464
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,086
"No more darker half"?

1465
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:56,523
Did you really think
that I'd let that happen?

1466
01:19:56,525 --> 01:20:00,493
That I'd let you take away my
power just because you're blind

1467
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:03,296
to what true power
can bring you?

1468
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:05,534
You don't know me.
Don't I?

1469
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:14,843
I saw how she trapped you,
fighting her holy moral mission.

1470
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,145
We don't need you to save us.

1471
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:21,917
We don't need to be fixed.

1472
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:27,620
These are not curses.

1473
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:30,425
They're gifts.

1474
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:32,859
Norman, no.
Quiet, lapdog.

1475
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:34,527
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1476
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:39,966
I've watched you from deep
behind Norman's cowardly eyes.

1477
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:45,371
Struggling to have
everything you want

1478
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:49,709
while the world tries
to make you choose.

1479
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:55,617
Gods don't have to choose.

1480
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:58,685
We take.

1481
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,053
May, run.

1482
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:24,644
Oh, my God.

1483
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:28,917
What have you done?
I liked you better before.

1484
01:21:37,025 --> 01:21:41,863
Up here. He's up there.
It's the guy from the bridge.

1485
01:22:03,718 --> 01:22:05,387
Did you see that?

1486
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:33,581
No, you don't!

1487
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:44,793
Strong enough to have it all.

1488
01:22:47,562 --> 01:22:49,998
Too weak to take it!

1489
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:26,468
Now I got you.

1490
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,905
I told you
there'd be consequences.

1491
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:52,291
Your weakness, Peter,
is morality.

1492
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:57,065
It's choking you.
Can't you feel it?

1493
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:06,708
It didn't work.

1494
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:08,775
Norman was right.

1495
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:13,548
He got it from you,
that pathetic sickness.

1496
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:19,852
You tried to fix me.

1497
01:24:19,854 --> 01:24:24,359
May, go.
Now I'm gonna fix you.

1498
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:29,364
May, run, please.

1499
01:24:31,766 --> 01:24:34,369
May!

1500
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:42,208
Peter, Peter, Peter.

1501
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:45,978
No good deed goes unpunished.

1502
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:48,750
You can thank me later.

1503
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:55,890
No!

1504
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,152
May?
Peter.

1505
01:25:26,154 --> 01:25:28,087
May, May, I'm here.

1506
01:25:28,089 --> 01:25:30,289
Oh!

1507
01:25:31,493 --> 01:25:33,025
May.
Oh!

1508
01:25:33,027 --> 01:25:34,760
May, I'm here.

1509
01:25:34,762 --> 01:25:36,329
Are you okay?
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1510
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:42,537
Okay-- Oh!

1511
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:45,738
It's okay. We're okay, right?

1512
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:47,273
Yeah. Knocked on my ass.

1513
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:49,008
Yeah, me too.
That's all.

1514
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:52,981
I think I broke my ribs.

1515
01:25:57,452 --> 01:25:59,552
This is all my fault, May.
No.

1516
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:02,021
I should have let Strange
send them back.

1517
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:03,956
You did the right thing.

1518
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:05,925
They would have been killed.

1519
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:07,693
You did the right thing.

1520
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:10,899
It's not my responsibility, May.

1521
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:15,303
Oh. What Norman said?

1522
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:17,803
My moral mission? No.

1523
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:20,909
No, May--
Peter, you listen to me.

1524
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:23,178
You have a gift.

1525
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:26,379
You have power.

1526
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:27,413
And with great power,

1527
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:32,487
there must also come
great responsibility, mm?

1528
01:26:36,724 --> 01:26:38,124
Yeah, I know.

1529
01:26:38,126 --> 01:26:40,059
Let's get the...out of here.

1530
01:26:40,061 --> 01:26:41,794
Okay, let's go.

1531
01:26:41,796 --> 01:26:44,999
Let me just catch my...

1532
01:26:59,347 --> 01:27:01,914
- What happened? Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1533
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:04,552
Yeah, you're okay.
What happened?

1534
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:07,386
Just have to...

1535
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:09,789
catch my breath.
Okay, well, catch your breath.

1536
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:12,291
I'm right here.
We're gonna take our time.

1537
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:13,259
You catch your breath.

1538
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:16,598
Then we'll take you
to a doctor, okay?

1539
01:27:33,848 --> 01:27:35,214
Are you okay?

1540
01:27:35,216 --> 01:27:38,451
Somebody help! I need
an ambulance, please! Somebody?

1541
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:41,687
What happened?
Nothing happened.

1542
01:27:41,689 --> 01:27:44,058
You're okay, you're okay.

1543
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:47,526
Let me just--
Let me catch my breath.

1544
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:50,029
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1545
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:52,333
I'm right here.

1546
01:27:58,373 --> 01:28:00,174
You're okay.

1547
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:02,977
It's just me and you.

1548
01:28:12,553 --> 01:28:13,988
May?

1549
01:28:19,994 --> 01:28:21,596
May?

1550
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:29,437
Will you look at me,
May, please?

1551
01:28:37,412 --> 01:28:38,846
May.

1552
01:28:39,514 --> 01:28:40,982
May.

1553
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:42,682
What are you doing, May?

1554
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:46,621
Please, will you just wake up
and talk to me? Please?

1555
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:11,279
Get out of the car now! Move!

1556
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:19,487
Get off, get off, get off me.

1557
01:29:20,722 --> 01:29:23,856
Peter! Run!
It's just me and you, okay?

1558
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:25,591
It's just me and you, okay?

1559
01:29:25,593 --> 01:29:28,661
Oh, May, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1560
01:29:28,663 --> 01:29:30,329
I'm so, so, so sorry.
I love you.

1561
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:33,032
- All right, Parker!
- Come out with your hands up!

1562
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:36,736
Come out right now,
or we will open fire!

1563
01:29:36,738 --> 01:29:38,873
Run!

1564
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:44,679
- All right, let's go.
- Let's go! Move in!

1565
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:03,765
Tragedy.

1566
01:30:06,434 --> 01:30:09,034
What else can I call it?

1567
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:11,003
What more need be said?

1568
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:15,174
The damage, the destruction.

1569
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:17,576
You saw it with your own eyes.

1570
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:20,713
When will people wake up
and realize

1571
01:30:20,715 --> 01:30:23,682
that everywhere
Spider-Man goes,

1572
01:30:23,684 --> 01:30:26,919
chaos and calamity ensue?

1573
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:32,658
Everything Spider-Man touches
comes to ruin.

1574
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:35,227
And we, the innocents,

1575
01:30:35,229 --> 01:30:38,366
are left to pick up the pieces.

1576
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:41,567
J. Jonah Jameson reporting.

1577
01:30:41,569 --> 01:30:45,873
Good night,
and God help us all.

1578
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:07,159
We are told that multiple
people have been injured,

1579
01:31:07,161 --> 01:31:12,698
and we can confirm at least
one person has been killed...

1580
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:14,635
Still nothing?

1581
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:17,271
No.

1582
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:34,322
I'm gonna press it.

1583
01:31:34,789 --> 01:31:38,493
What? No, he--
I know he told me to wait...

1584
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:41,494
but I'm gonna do it.
I just wish--

1585
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:43,865
I just wish we could see him.

1586
01:31:48,636 --> 01:31:50,569
Ned?
Yeah?

1587
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:53,174
Do that again.
Yeah.

1588
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:57,245
I just wish we could see him.

1589
01:31:58,846 --> 01:32:01,180
Oh. Okay.

1590
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:04,218
I just wish we could see Peter.

1591
01:32:06,888 --> 01:32:09,755
Whoa.

1592
01:32:09,757 --> 01:32:13,158
Lola, you're right. I am magic.

1593
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,426
Is that him?

1594
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:17,263
Yeah, yeah, it has to be.
Peter. Peter!

1595
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:19,265
Hey, Peter!
Peter!

1596
01:32:19,267 --> 01:32:21,035
Yeah.

1597
01:32:24,772 --> 01:32:26,005
Whoa!

1598
01:32:28,142 --> 01:32:28,908
Hi. Hi.

1599
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:32,945
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay. I'm a nice guy.

1600
01:32:35,483 --> 01:32:37,218
Okay.

1601
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,253
Who the hell are you?
I'm Peter Parker.

1602
01:32:41,255 --> 01:32:45,925
That's not possible.
I am Spider-Man, in my world.

1603
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:49,764
But then yesterday, I was--

1604
01:32:50,965 --> 01:32:53,334
I was just here.

1605
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:56,103
Wow.

1606
01:32:56,737 --> 01:33:01,874
String theory,
multi-dimensional reality...

1607
01:33:01,876 --> 01:33:04,043
and matter displacement.

1608
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:06,378
- All real?
- Yeah.

1609
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:08,382
I knew it.

1610
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:11,417
This has to be
because of the spell.

1611
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,118
The spell? Like magic spell?

1612
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,020
There's no spell. No.
No spell.

1613
01:33:15,022 --> 01:33:16,822
Magic's real here too?
I mean--

1614
01:33:16,824 --> 01:33:18,424
Shut up, Ned.
No, it's not real.

1615
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:22,161
Shut up. Stop talking.
There's magicians, but no--

1616
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:24,630
Stop. Stop.

1617
01:33:24,632 --> 01:33:25,698
Prove it.
Prove what?

1618
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:28,200
That you're Peter Parker.
I don't carry

1619
01:33:28,202 --> 01:33:29,268
an ID with me, you know?

1620
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:33,240
Kind of defeats the whole
anonymous superhero thing.

1621
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:36,475
Why'd you do that?
To see if you have the tingle.

1622
01:33:36,477 --> 01:33:38,644
I have the tingle thing,
just not for bread.

1623
01:33:38,646 --> 01:33:40,713
Can you not
throw the bread again?

1624
01:33:40,715 --> 01:33:44,318
You're a deeply
mistrusting person...

1625
01:33:45,086 --> 01:33:47,188
and I respect it.

1626
01:33:51,759 --> 01:33:52,558
Crawl around.

1627
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,560
Crawl around?
Yes.

1628
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:55,894
No.
Yes, crawl around.

1629
01:33:55,896 --> 01:33:57,696
Why do I need to?
This is not enough.

1630
01:33:57,698 --> 01:33:58,964
This is plenty.
No, it's not.

1631
01:33:58,966 --> 01:34:00,833
Yes, it is. It is.
No, it's not. Nuh-uh.

1632
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:04,338
How do I stick to the ceiling?
Do it.

1633
01:34:05,139 --> 01:34:06,538
Ned.

1634
01:34:11,612 --> 01:34:13,679
My lola's asking
if you could just

1635
01:34:13,681 --> 01:34:15,247
get the cobweb there.

1636
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:18,319
Since you're, like, up there.
Yeah.

1637
01:34:25,259 --> 01:34:27,628
Thank you.

1638
01:34:31,365 --> 01:34:32,665
We goo--?

1639
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:34,633
We good?
For now.

1640
01:34:34,635 --> 01:34:37,636
So I opened the wrong portal
to the wrong Peter Parker.

1641
01:34:37,638 --> 01:34:40,539
I guess you keep doing it
until we find the real one.

1642
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:43,075
Ouch.
No offense.

1643
01:34:43,077 --> 01:34:45,579
Okay.
Okay. You got it.

1644
01:34:47,148 --> 01:34:48,213
Find Peter Parker.

1645
01:34:48,215 --> 01:34:50,783
What's the thing on his hand?
Shh.

1646
01:34:50,785 --> 01:34:53,521
Find Peter Parker.

1647
01:34:54,722 --> 01:34:57,224
Find Peter Parker!

1648
01:35:05,433 --> 01:35:08,200
Great, it's just
some random guy.

1649
01:35:08,202 --> 01:35:09,268
Hello.

1650
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:10,636
Um, I hope it's okay,

1651
01:35:10,638 --> 01:35:12,938
I just came through this, uh...

1652
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:15,476
Oh. It just closed.

1653
01:35:16,477 --> 01:35:17,710
You're Peter?

1654
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:21,248
Yeah. Peter Parker.

1655
01:35:22,783 --> 01:35:25,052
I-- I've seen you two--

1656
01:35:27,088 --> 01:35:28,823
Hi. Heh.

1657
01:35:31,525 --> 01:35:35,229
Wait. He's--
He's not your friend.

1658
01:35:47,274 --> 01:35:49,742
Huh.

1659
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:53,212
Wait. So you're Spider-Man too?
Why didn't you just say that?

1660
01:35:53,214 --> 01:35:55,614
I generally don't
go around advertising it.

1661
01:35:55,616 --> 01:35:58,650
Kind of defeats the whole
anonymous superhero thing.

1662
01:35:58,652 --> 01:36:00,886
I said that.
That's what he just said.

1663
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:16,001
My lola's asking if you could
clean up the webs you just shot.

1664
01:36:16,003 --> 01:36:17,469
Oh, sorry, Lola.
Yes, of course.

1665
01:36:17,471 --> 01:36:20,172
- I'm going to bed.
- Night, Lola.

1666
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:21,807
Good night, Ned's lola.

1667
01:36:21,809 --> 01:36:24,943
Uh, this might seem
kind of weird,

1668
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:27,212
but I've been trying
to find your friend

1669
01:36:27,214 --> 01:36:29,248
ever since I got here.

1670
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:32,086
I just have this sense that...

1671
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,887
That he needs my help.

1672
01:36:34,889 --> 01:36:36,791
Our help.

1673
01:36:37,925 --> 01:36:38,791
He does.

1674
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:39,858
We don't know where he is.

1675
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:45,664
And, um, honestly, right now
we're all he really has left.

1676
01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:51,203
Well, uh, is there someplace
that he might go

1677
01:36:51,205 --> 01:36:54,241
that has meaning to him?

1678
01:36:54,575 --> 01:36:58,377
Like a place
where he would go to just--?

1679
01:36:58,379 --> 01:37:00,948
Get away from everything?

1680
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:06,518
For me, it was the top
of the Chrysler Building.

1681
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:07,953
Empire State.

1682
01:37:07,955 --> 01:37:11,992
It's a better view.
That is a sweet view.

1683
01:37:13,994 --> 01:37:15,060
Yes.

1684
01:37:15,062 --> 01:37:19,667
Yeah. I-- I think I know
exactly where that would be.

1685
01:37:55,069 --> 01:37:56,704
I'm sorry.

1686
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:05,412
Peter, there's...

1687
01:38:05,946 --> 01:38:08,449
There's some people here.

1688
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:11,418
What?
Um...

1689
01:38:19,526 --> 01:38:21,793
Hey, wait, wait! Whoa!

1690
01:38:21,795 --> 01:38:23,130
What...?

1691
01:38:25,699 --> 01:38:27,034
Sorry...

1692
01:38:28,502 --> 01:38:29,904
about May.

1693
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:35,876
Yeah. Sorry.

1694
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:38,477
I got some understanding
of what it is you're--

1695
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:42,581
No, please don't tell me that
you know what I'm going through.

1696
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:45,452
Okay.
She's gone.

1697
01:38:47,388 --> 01:38:49,390
And it's all my fault.

1698
01:38:52,927 --> 01:38:55,129
She died for nothing.

1699
01:38:57,364 --> 01:39:00,532
So I'm gonna do what I should
have done in the first place.

1700
01:39:00,534 --> 01:39:02,937
Peter--
Please don't.

1701
01:39:03,404 --> 01:39:04,770
You don't belong here.

1702
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:05,671
Either of you.

1703
01:39:05,673 --> 01:39:07,806
So I'm sending you home.

1704
01:39:07,808 --> 01:39:11,443
Those other guys
are from your worlds, right?

1705
01:39:11,445 --> 01:39:12,811
So you deal with it.

1706
01:39:12,813 --> 01:39:15,814
If they die, if you kill them...

1707
01:39:15,816 --> 01:39:17,284
that's on you.

1708
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:19,751
It's not my problem.

1709
01:39:19,753 --> 01:39:21,755
I don't care anymore.

1710
01:39:22,556 --> 01:39:24,224
I'm done.

1711
01:39:27,695 --> 01:39:31,432
I'm really sorry
that I dragged you into this.

1712
01:39:34,068 --> 01:39:36,737
But you have to go home now.

1713
01:39:38,572 --> 01:39:40,174
Good luck.

1714
01:39:44,745 --> 01:39:47,481
My Uncle Ben was killed.

1715
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:50,284
It was my fault.

1716
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:52,953
I lost...

1717
01:39:55,089 --> 01:39:57,658
I lost Gwen, my, um...

1718
01:39:58,525 --> 01:40:00,728
She was my MJ.

1719
01:40:02,363 --> 01:40:04,398
I couldn't save her.

1720
01:40:04,898 --> 01:40:08,802
I'm never gonna be able
to forgive myself for that.

1721
01:40:10,304 --> 01:40:12,537
But I carried on,
tried to, um...

1722
01:40:12,539 --> 01:40:16,844
Tried to keep going,
tried to keep being the, uh...

1723
01:40:17,511 --> 01:40:19,277
The friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man

1724
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:22,080
'cause I know that's what
she would've wanted.

1725
01:40:22,082 --> 01:40:26,920
But at some point, I just...
I stopped pulling my punches.

1726
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:32,026
I got rageful.

1727
01:40:33,727 --> 01:40:35,529
I got bitter.

1728
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:37,896
I just don't want you

1729
01:40:37,898 --> 01:40:41,235
to end up like... Like me.

1730
01:40:42,002 --> 01:40:44,903
The night Ben died...

1731
01:40:44,905 --> 01:40:48,542
I hunted down the man
who I thought did it.

1732
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:52,079
I wanted him dead.

1733
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:56,050
I got what I wanted.

1734
01:40:57,785 --> 01:41:00,487
It didn't make it better.

1735
01:41:03,357 --> 01:41:06,493
It took me a long time...

1736
01:41:07,261 --> 01:41:10,664
to learn to get through
that darkness.

1737
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:14,935
I wanna kill him.

1738
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:19,239
I wanna tear him apart.

1739
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:25,345
I can still hear
her voice in my head.

1740
01:41:29,616 --> 01:41:31,049
Even after she was hurt,

1741
01:41:31,051 --> 01:41:34,721
she said to me
that we did the right thing.

1742
01:41:42,496 --> 01:41:45,132
She told me
that with great power...

1743
01:41:46,633 --> 01:41:49,069
Comes great responsibility.

1744
01:41:53,474 --> 01:41:55,440
Wait, what?
How do you know that?

1745
01:41:55,442 --> 01:41:57,109
Uncle Ben said it.

1746
01:41:57,111 --> 01:41:59,113
The day he died.

1747
01:42:02,749 --> 01:42:06,120
Maybe she didn't die
for nothing, Peter.

1748
01:42:14,895 --> 01:42:20,332
Okay, so, uh, Connors,
Marko, Dillon and, um...

1749
01:42:20,334 --> 01:42:24,169
I think that I can repair the
devices for Dillon and Marko,

1750
01:42:24,171 --> 01:42:25,203
but the others...

1751
01:42:25,205 --> 01:42:29,710
Oh, I got Connors. I've cured
him once, so no big deal.

1752
01:42:30,511 --> 01:42:33,578
What? It's no big deal.
Great.

1753
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:35,716
Yeah, that's great.

1754
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:41,119
I think I can make
an anti-serum for Dr. Osborn.

1755
01:42:41,121 --> 01:42:43,857
Been thinking about it
a long time.

1756
01:42:46,226 --> 01:42:49,997
Gotta cure all of them. Right?

1757
01:42:50,764 --> 01:42:52,166
Right.

1758
01:42:53,133 --> 01:42:55,235
That's what we do.

1759
01:43:02,943 --> 01:43:04,409
What?

1760
01:43:04,411 --> 01:43:06,280
Just three yous.

1761
01:43:21,528 --> 01:43:22,863
Um...

1762
01:43:23,597 --> 01:43:28,001
So do you have
a best friend too?

1763
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:31,171
I did.

1764
01:43:32,573 --> 01:43:34,341
You did?

1765
01:43:35,175 --> 01:43:37,544
He died in my arms...

1766
01:43:38,512 --> 01:43:41,081
after he tried to kill me.

1767
01:43:42,149 --> 01:43:44,685
It was heartbreaking.

1768
01:43:45,919 --> 01:43:47,754
Dude.

1769
01:43:53,427 --> 01:43:56,695
Hey.
Will you run a diagnostic?

1770
01:43:56,697 --> 01:43:58,198
Yeah.

1771
01:44:07,007 --> 01:44:08,873
Hey, you okay?

1772
01:44:08,875 --> 01:44:11,476
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
Are you okay?

1773
01:44:11,478 --> 01:44:13,080
Mm-hm.

1774
01:44:15,148 --> 01:44:17,616
You don't deserve this.

1775
01:44:17,618 --> 01:44:22,020
I've ruined your life.
No. No, no, no.

1776
01:44:22,022 --> 01:44:24,658
Look at me. I'm here.

1777
01:44:25,525 --> 01:44:27,561
Not going anywhere.

1778
01:44:28,195 --> 01:44:29,294
We're gonna get through this.

1779
01:44:29,296 --> 01:44:32,831
And we're gonna get
through it together.

1780
01:44:32,833 --> 01:44:34,334
Okay?

1781
01:44:35,135 --> 01:44:38,138
Okay.

1782
01:44:41,908 --> 01:44:43,810
Thank you.

1783
01:44:54,488 --> 01:44:56,888
You have someone?

1784
01:44:56,890 --> 01:44:57,656
No.

1785
01:44:57,658 --> 01:45:03,662
Ah, I got no time for
Peter Parker stuff, you know?

1786
01:45:03,664 --> 01:45:04,963
Hm.

1787
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:07,098
Do you?
Uh...

1788
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:11,136
-that's a little complicated.
-Oh, I understand.

1789
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:14,372
I guess it's just not
in the cards for guys like us.

1790
01:45:14,374 --> 01:45:16,875
Well, I wouldn't give up.

1791
01:45:16,877 --> 01:45:20,145
Took a while
but we made it work.

1792
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:21,946
Yeah?
Yeah.

1793
01:45:21,948 --> 01:45:23,648
Me and...

1794
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:25,118
MJ.

1795
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:28,422
My MJ. Uh...

1796
01:45:28,722 --> 01:45:31,790
It gets confusing here.

1797
01:45:31,792 --> 01:45:32,757
Yeah.

1798
01:45:32,759 --> 01:45:34,492
- Peter!
- Yeah?

1799
01:45:34,494 --> 01:45:38,029
Oh, sorry, did you mean...?
"Peter" Peter.

1800
01:45:38,031 --> 01:45:39,864
We're all called Peter.
We're all Peter.

1801
01:45:39,866 --> 01:45:43,368
Peter Parker?
Again, we're all Peter Parker.

1802
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:45,904
The computer.
Oh!

1803
01:45:45,906 --> 01:45:47,739
Oh, I'm ready.
Yeah. Me too.

1804
01:45:47,741 --> 01:45:49,941
Okay, so now, all we gotta do

1805
01:45:49,943 --> 01:45:52,477
is lure these guys
someplace, right?

1806
01:45:52,479 --> 01:45:56,581
Try to cure them
while they try to kill us,

1807
01:45:56,583 --> 01:45:57,716
and then send them home.

1808
01:45:57,718 --> 01:46:00,185
Using a magic box.
Well, that's the plan.

1809
01:46:00,187 --> 01:46:04,155
Are you gonna go into battle
dressed as a cool youth pastor,

1810
01:46:04,157 --> 01:46:06,360
or do you got your suit?

1811
01:46:06,727 --> 01:46:09,027
Good.
Here's your web cartridges.

1812
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:11,329
Oh, thanks, man.
What's that for?

1813
01:46:11,331 --> 01:46:15,533
Uh, it's my web fluid.
It's for my web shooters. Why?

1814
01:46:15,535 --> 01:46:17,337
Whoa!

1815
01:46:18,004 --> 01:46:19,003
That came out of you.

1816
01:46:19,005 --> 01:46:20,905
Yeah. You can't do that, huh?

1817
01:46:20,907 --> 01:46:22,774
No.
How on earth does that--?

1818
01:46:22,776 --> 01:46:25,977
We're getting sidetracked. This
is where we'll do this, okay?

1819
01:46:25,979 --> 01:46:28,179
It's isolated,
so no one should get hurt.

1820
01:46:28,181 --> 01:46:30,815
We draw them there with the box.
It's the thing they want.

1821
01:46:30,817 --> 01:46:33,385
All we have to do
is figure out how to get there.

1822
01:46:33,387 --> 01:46:34,619
We could portal there.
What?

1823
01:46:34,621 --> 01:46:37,355
I'm magic now.
Yeah, he's right. He can.

1824
01:46:37,357 --> 01:46:39,257
Yeah, we saw.
Yeah, he is.

1825
01:46:39,259 --> 01:46:41,693
Wait, really?
I got Doctor Strange magic.

1826
01:46:41,695 --> 01:46:43,261
No way.
Yeah.

1827
01:46:43,263 --> 01:46:46,164
I promise,
I won't turn into a supervillain

1828
01:46:46,166 --> 01:46:48,201
and try to kill you.

1829
01:46:49,703 --> 01:46:51,603
Okay.

1830
01:46:51,605 --> 01:46:53,607
Thank you.

1831
01:46:57,277 --> 01:46:59,644
Um, all right,
here goes nothing.

1832
01:46:59,646 --> 01:47:01,780
What's that thing
you always say?

1833
01:47:01,782 --> 01:47:05,750
Expect disappointment and--
No, no, no.

1834
01:47:05,752 --> 01:47:07,852
We're gonna kick some ass.

1835
01:47:07,854 --> 01:47:09,320
Okay.

1836
01:47:09,322 --> 01:47:11,990
Cure. Cure some ass.

1837
01:47:11,992 --> 01:47:13,892
Cure that ass.

1838
01:47:15,595 --> 01:47:16,895
Ladies and gentlemen,

1839
01:47:16,897 --> 01:47:18,930
the Bugle tip line
has just received a call

1840
01:47:18,932 --> 01:47:22,434
from none other than the
fugitive known as Spider-Man,

1841
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:26,004
fresh from his rampage
in Queens.

1842
01:47:26,006 --> 01:47:27,038
So, Peter Parker,

1843
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:29,774
what pernicious propaganda
are you peddling?

1844
01:47:29,776 --> 01:47:32,076
Just the truth.
Oh, sure.

1845
01:47:32,078 --> 01:47:33,978
The truth is...

1846
01:47:33,980 --> 01:47:36,247
that this is all my fault.

1847
01:47:36,249 --> 01:47:39,617
I accidentally brought
those dangerous people here.

1848
01:47:39,619 --> 01:47:40,919
Well, he admits it.

1849
01:47:40,921 --> 01:47:43,924
And if those people
are watching...

1850
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:47,692
just know that I really did
try to help you.

1851
01:47:47,694 --> 01:47:50,462
I mean,
I could have killed you...

1852
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:54,067
at any given moment,
but I didn't.

1853
01:47:55,101 --> 01:47:56,134
My Aunt May taught me

1854
01:47:56,136 --> 01:47:58,503
that everyone deserves
a second chance.

1855
01:47:58,505 --> 01:47:59,437
That's why I'm here.

1856
01:47:59,439 --> 01:48:02,075
And where is "here," exactly?

1857
01:48:02,943 --> 01:48:06,079
A place that represents
second chances.

1858
01:48:07,614 --> 01:48:10,548
- The Statue of Liberty?
- Good God, folks.

1859
01:48:10,550 --> 01:48:14,419
He's about to destroy
another national landmark.

1860
01:48:14,421 --> 01:48:15,854
World, if you're watching...

1861
01:48:15,856 --> 01:48:19,123
Believe me,
the world is watching.

1862
01:48:19,125 --> 01:48:21,027
...wish me luck.

1863
01:48:21,328 --> 01:48:24,831
Your friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man could use some.

1864
01:48:30,303 --> 01:48:32,604
Okay, guys,
it could be any minute now.

1865
01:48:32,606 --> 01:48:35,742
Yep, almost done.

1866
01:48:39,513 --> 01:48:44,215
You know, Max was like
the sweetest guy ever

1867
01:48:44,217 --> 01:48:49,856
before he fell into...
a pool of electric eels.

1868
01:48:50,824 --> 01:48:52,726
That'll do it.

1869
01:48:54,794 --> 01:48:58,732
All the things I wished
I could have done differently.

1870
01:49:00,267 --> 01:49:02,936
Now to have a second chance.

1871
01:49:03,904 --> 01:49:05,238
Yeah.

1872
01:49:08,675 --> 01:49:11,344
Mm. Oh, there it goes.

1873
01:49:12,145 --> 01:49:14,078
Heh, you okay?

1874
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:15,413
Oh, it's my back.

1875
01:49:15,415 --> 01:49:19,017
It's kind of stiff
from all the swinging, I guess.

1876
01:49:19,019 --> 01:49:20,952
Yeah. No, I got
a middle back thing too.

1877
01:49:20,954 --> 01:49:24,889
Really?
Yeah. You want me to crack it?

1878
01:49:24,891 --> 01:49:26,024
Yeah.
Yeah?

1879
01:49:26,026 --> 01:49:28,562
Yeah, that'd be great.
All right.

1880
01:49:29,329 --> 01:49:31,097
You ready?
Yeah.

1881
01:49:33,466 --> 01:49:36,200
Yep. That's good.

1882
01:49:36,202 --> 01:49:39,103
How is it?
Wow.

1883
01:49:39,105 --> 01:49:42,240
-That's good. That's better.
-Right? Yeah.

1884
01:49:42,242 --> 01:49:43,543
Wow.

1885
01:49:45,745 --> 01:49:49,247
This is so cool.
I always wanted brothers.

1886
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:53,217
We should do this again,
like, all hang out.

1887
01:49:53,219 --> 01:49:54,085
It's nice.

1888
01:49:54,087 --> 01:49:57,255
We should maybe, you know,
focus on...

1889
01:49:57,257 --> 01:49:58,756
On not getting killed tonight.

1890
01:49:58,758 --> 01:50:00,525
Yeah. For sure.
That's a good idea.

1891
01:50:00,527 --> 01:50:04,162
I'll just grab your number
at the end of the battle.

1892
01:50:04,164 --> 01:50:05,563
You got it.

1893
01:50:05,565 --> 01:50:09,133
So you, like, make your own
web fluid in your body?

1894
01:50:09,135 --> 01:50:10,568
I'd rather not talk about this.

1895
01:50:10,570 --> 01:50:12,870
I don't mean to--
But are you teasing me?

1896
01:50:12,872 --> 01:50:14,472
No, no.
He's not teasing you.

1897
01:50:14,474 --> 01:50:16,307
It's just that we can't do that,

1898
01:50:16,309 --> 01:50:19,877
so we're curious as to how your
web situation works, that's all.

1899
01:50:19,879 --> 01:50:22,714
If it's personal, I don't wanna
pry, but I think it's cool.

1900
01:50:22,716 --> 01:50:26,050
I-- I wish I could tell you,
but it's, like, I don't do it.

1901
01:50:26,052 --> 01:50:28,620
Like I don't...
Like I don't do breathing.

1902
01:50:28,622 --> 01:50:30,989
Like, breathing just happens.
Whoa.

1903
01:50:30,991 --> 01:50:33,391
It's just, like,
when it releases,

1904
01:50:33,393 --> 01:50:35,293
it's like a clean release.

1905
01:50:35,295 --> 01:50:36,127
Can I ask something?

1906
01:50:36,129 --> 01:50:37,362
Yeah.
Is it like:

1907
01:50:37,364 --> 01:50:39,697
When you think it, it webs?

1908
01:50:39,699 --> 01:50:41,032
That's a good way to put it.

1909
01:50:41,034 --> 01:50:44,068
Because if I press...
I have to have a mechanism.

1910
01:50:44,070 --> 01:50:48,439
Right.
But for you, is it like, "Web"?

1911
01:50:48,441 --> 01:50:49,774
And then it webs?

1912
01:50:49,776 --> 01:50:52,343
Not even conscious
at this point.

1913
01:50:52,345 --> 01:50:53,978
It's just like riding a bike.

1914
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:55,813
Does it just come out
of your wrists,

1915
01:50:55,815 --> 01:50:58,716
or does it come out
of anywhere else?

1916
01:50:58,718 --> 01:51:00,518
Only... Only the wrists.

1917
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,687
Never had a block?
I run out of webs all the time.

1918
01:51:02,689 --> 01:51:05,590
- I have to make my own in a lab.
- Right. That's--

1919
01:51:05,592 --> 01:51:07,925
It's a hassle compared
to what you got.

1920
01:51:07,927 --> 01:51:09,727
Sounds like a hassle.
But I did.

1921
01:51:09,729 --> 01:51:10,762
You said that, I was like,

1922
01:51:10,764 --> 01:51:13,731
"Oh, I had a web block."
Whoa. Why?

1923
01:51:13,733 --> 01:51:15,233
Existential crisis stuff.

1924
01:51:15,235 --> 01:51:17,201
Yeah.
Don't get me started on that.

1925
01:51:17,203 --> 01:51:20,338
I'm not sure what to say.
It's just a natural thing.

1926
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:22,142
It just happens.

1927
01:51:22,876 --> 01:51:23,808
I don't know.

1928
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:25,009
It's so cool, man.

1929
01:51:25,011 --> 01:51:26,911
Like, I wanna see the holes.

1930
01:51:26,913 --> 01:51:29,280
Hey. What are, like,
some of the craziest villains

1931
01:51:29,282 --> 01:51:32,216
-that you guys have fought?
-Seems you've met some of them.

1932
01:51:32,218 --> 01:51:33,518
Heh-heh, that's a good question.

1933
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:39,223
Yeah, I fought an alien
made out of black goo once.

1934
01:51:39,225 --> 01:51:41,526
Oh, no way.
I fought an alien too.

1935
01:51:41,528 --> 01:51:43,127
On Earth and in space.
Oh.

1936
01:51:43,129 --> 01:51:44,796
He was purple.
I wanna fight an alien.

1937
01:51:44,798 --> 01:51:49,434
I'm still, like, that you fought
an alien in space.

1938
01:51:49,436 --> 01:51:54,172
I'm always simultaneously,
like, completely stunned

1939
01:51:54,174 --> 01:51:58,009
by the fantastical nature
of these things,

1940
01:51:58,011 --> 01:52:01,379
and it's also just like,
"Yeah. Okay. Yeah."

1941
01:52:01,381 --> 01:52:03,448
Yeah, it's Monday. Yeah.

1942
01:52:03,450 --> 01:52:04,315
I mean--

1943
01:52:04,317 --> 01:52:07,552
I'm lame compared--
I fought a Russian guy

1944
01:52:07,554 --> 01:52:09,654
in a rhinoceros machine.

1945
01:52:09,656 --> 01:52:10,421
That's cool.

1946
01:52:10,423 --> 01:52:11,556
Not as-- No, it's not.

1947
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:13,958
Can we rewind it back
to the "I'm lame" part?

1948
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:16,427
'Cause you are not.
Thanks. I appreciate that.

1949
01:52:16,429 --> 01:52:19,030
I'm not saying I am--
But it's just the self-talk.

1950
01:52:19,032 --> 01:52:21,332
Maybe we should...
Listen, I--

1951
01:52:21,334 --> 01:52:22,734
'Cause you're amazing.

1952
01:52:22,736 --> 01:52:24,368
Just to take it in for a minute.

1953
01:52:24,370 --> 01:52:27,205
Yeah, I can take it in.
You-- You are amazing.

1954
01:52:27,207 --> 01:52:28,873
I can. Thank you.
You are amazing.

1955
01:52:28,875 --> 01:52:31,342
Will you say it?
I needed to hear that.

1956
01:52:31,344 --> 01:52:32,376
Thank you.

1957
01:52:32,378 --> 01:52:35,580
All right, guys, focus up.
You feel that?

1958
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:36,781
Yeah.

1959
01:52:43,456 --> 01:52:46,126
What's up, Peter?

1960
01:52:47,794 --> 01:52:49,927
How you like the new-new?

1961
01:52:49,929 --> 01:52:54,565
Look, you give it to me,
I'm gonna destroy it.

1962
01:52:55,735 --> 01:52:57,602
But I'll let you live.

1963
01:52:57,604 --> 01:53:00,640
Don't make me a murderer, Peter.

1964
01:53:02,041 --> 01:53:04,744
Okay, guys, here he comes.

1965
01:53:10,483 --> 01:53:14,020
Hey, Max, I missed you, man. Ho!

1966
01:53:16,022 --> 01:53:18,756
All right, MJ, heads up!

1967
01:53:18,758 --> 01:53:20,691
Got it! Close it.

1968
01:53:22,629 --> 01:53:24,896
Uh, Ned, it's not closing.

1969
01:53:24,898 --> 01:53:25,730
Yeah, I know.

1970
01:53:25,732 --> 01:53:27,165
Why isn't it closing?
I don't know.

1971
01:53:27,167 --> 01:53:31,404
Did you close it before? No?
I mean, I've opened some.

1972
01:53:39,312 --> 01:53:41,612
Max, Max, Max.
Can we talk for a second?

1973
01:53:41,614 --> 01:53:44,415
Just you and me, just talk?
Look who showed up.

1974
01:53:44,417 --> 01:53:46,484
My old friend Spider-Man.
I'm trying to save you.

1975
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:49,287
That's all I've ever wanted.
You're not trying to save me.

1976
01:53:49,289 --> 01:53:51,756
I am.
You ain't even the shit no more.

1977
01:53:51,758 --> 01:53:53,825
Oh...
Don't worry about me.

1978
01:53:53,827 --> 01:53:55,893
I'll save myself.

1979
01:53:55,895 --> 01:53:58,362
Burn up!
Aah! Whoa!

1980
01:53:58,364 --> 01:54:00,631
Well, I got his attention.
Now what?

1981
01:54:00,633 --> 01:54:01,499
Okay, great.

1982
01:54:01,501 --> 01:54:06,539
Just FYI, lizard guy's here too.

1983
01:54:07,473 --> 01:54:09,440
Guys, comm check. Hello?

1984
01:54:09,442 --> 01:54:11,509
I need Max's cure.

1985
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:13,211
Yeah. I'm on it.

1986
01:54:13,213 --> 01:54:15,279
I need the Lizard cure.

1987
01:54:15,281 --> 01:54:17,648
Uh, okay, okay.

1988
01:54:22,355 --> 01:54:23,621
Where's the box, Peter?

1989
01:54:23,623 --> 01:54:26,960
Flint, we could help everyone.
I don't care!

1990
01:54:38,571 --> 01:54:40,073
Sorry!

1991
01:54:40,974 --> 01:54:41,606
Gross!

1992
01:54:41,608 --> 01:54:43,541
Sad to tell you, Sandman,

1993
01:54:43,543 --> 01:54:45,712
nobody's going home.

1994
01:55:23,283 --> 01:55:25,249
What the hell
is going on out there?

1995
01:55:25,251 --> 01:55:26,717
I keep yelling at you, Peter 2!

1996
01:55:26,719 --> 01:55:29,987
But I thought you were Peter 2.
What? I'm not Peter 2.

1997
01:55:29,989 --> 01:55:32,456
Stop arguing, both of you!
Listen to Peter 1.

1998
01:55:32,458 --> 01:55:34,825
We're clearly
not very good at this.

1999
01:55:34,827 --> 01:55:35,660
I know, I know. We suck.

2000
01:55:35,662 --> 01:55:37,461
I don't know
how to work as a team.

2001
01:55:37,463 --> 01:55:40,631
Me neither.
I do. I've been in a team, okay?

2002
01:55:40,633 --> 01:55:42,466
I don't wanna brag, but I will.

2003
01:55:42,468 --> 01:55:43,467
I was in the Avengers.

2004
01:55:43,469 --> 01:55:44,802
The Avengers?
Yeah.

2005
01:55:44,804 --> 01:55:46,404
That's great.
Thank you.

2006
01:55:46,406 --> 01:55:47,872
What is that?

2007
01:55:47,874 --> 01:55:49,974
You don't have the Avengers?
Is that a band?

2008
01:55:49,976 --> 01:55:52,610
Are you in a band?
No, I'm not in a band.

2009
01:55:52,612 --> 01:55:54,145
The Avengers is
Earth's mightiest--

2010
01:55:54,147 --> 01:55:55,913
How's this helping?
It's not important.

2011
01:55:55,915 --> 01:55:58,249
All we gotta do is focus,
trust your tingle

2012
01:55:58,251 --> 01:56:00,051
and coordinate our attacks.

2013
01:56:00,053 --> 01:56:01,252
Yes. Okay.

2014
01:56:01,254 --> 01:56:03,054
Let's pick one target.
Right.

2015
01:56:03,056 --> 01:56:04,689
We take them off the board
one at a time.

2016
01:56:04,691 --> 01:56:07,858
You got it. Peter 1, Peter 2.
Peter 2.

2017
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:08,793
Peter 3.
Peter 3.

2018
01:56:08,795 --> 01:56:11,963
Let's do this. Ready?
Wait, wait, wait!

2019
01:56:11,965 --> 01:56:14,100
I love you guys.

2020
01:56:15,935 --> 01:56:17,837
Thank you.

2021
01:56:18,371 --> 01:56:21,038
All right, let's do this.
Let's go.

2022
01:56:26,579 --> 01:56:28,948
Yes!

2023
01:56:50,203 --> 01:56:52,336
Okay, Spider-Mans.

2024
01:56:52,338 --> 01:56:53,904
Sandman's first.

2025
01:56:53,906 --> 01:56:56,173
I'm gonna lead him
inside the statue.

2026
01:56:56,175 --> 01:56:59,545
I'll meet you at the top.

2027
01:57:00,646 --> 01:57:02,680
Come on!
Hey!

2028
01:57:05,184 --> 01:57:08,988
Hey, Dr. Connors.
Hello, Peter.

2029
01:57:09,589 --> 01:57:12,392
Peter 1!
I got it!

2030
01:57:23,369 --> 01:57:26,572
Flint, we're trying to help you!

2031
01:57:28,007 --> 01:57:29,940
Guys, I'm at the top.

2032
01:57:29,942 --> 01:57:31,409
I need the cure!

2033
01:57:33,146 --> 01:57:35,713
I'm coming, I'm coming,
I'm coming.

2034
01:57:36,883 --> 01:57:40,618
Just wait your turn, Doc!

2035
01:57:40,620 --> 01:57:43,322
I'll be right back.

2036
01:58:19,358 --> 01:58:21,094
It's okay, Flint.

2037
01:58:22,695 --> 01:58:25,129
We're gonna get you home.

2038
01:58:25,131 --> 01:58:28,101
You just stay right here.

2039
01:58:32,205 --> 01:58:33,104
How do we stop him?

2040
01:58:33,106 --> 01:58:34,538
I've never seen him
this powerful.

2041
01:58:34,540 --> 01:58:35,573
It's the arc reactor.

2042
01:58:35,575 --> 01:58:36,474
We gotta get it off him.

2043
01:58:36,476 --> 01:58:39,278
You're not gonna
take this from me.

2044
01:58:41,314 --> 01:58:43,483
That's not gonna work.

2045
01:58:47,386 --> 01:58:48,819
We gotta do this up close.

2046
01:58:48,821 --> 01:58:51,222
Peter 2, go right.
Peter 3, go left.

2047
01:58:51,224 --> 01:58:52,658
On me. Unh!

2048
01:58:55,595 --> 01:58:58,529
Yeah!

2049
01:59:18,651 --> 01:59:22,286
I'm trying to close it. I can't
help that it's not working.

2050
01:59:22,288 --> 01:59:25,156
It's fine. You'll do it again.
We'll keep trying.

2051
01:59:25,158 --> 01:59:27,458
All right, we got this.
Focus and close the portal.

2052
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:29,495
Close it.

2053
01:59:32,198 --> 01:59:33,564
Oh, no. No, no, no.

2054
01:59:33,566 --> 01:59:37,170
And that is a lizard,
and we should go!

2055
01:59:41,507 --> 01:59:42,406
Run!

2056
01:59:42,408 --> 01:59:45,476
Come on! Come on, this way.
Quick, quick, quick!

2057
01:59:45,478 --> 01:59:47,077
Connors, stop!

2058
01:59:56,422 --> 01:59:57,957
Yeah.

2059
02:00:09,702 --> 02:00:11,969
Leave them. They're mine.

2060
02:00:11,971 --> 02:00:15,139
I don't need your help.
I got it just fine.

2061
02:00:15,141 --> 02:00:17,877
Dr. Octavius, no.

2062
02:00:19,912 --> 02:00:22,148
What are you doing?

2063
02:00:22,915 --> 02:00:24,717
Get it off of me.

2064
02:00:35,161 --> 02:00:36,829
There you go.

2065
02:00:55,348 --> 02:00:56,916
MJ!

2066
02:01:07,426 --> 02:01:08,292
Whoa.

2067
02:01:08,294 --> 02:01:11,063
We gotta hide this thing.
Oh, right.

2068
02:01:14,567 --> 02:01:17,169
Nice, Ned!
Oh, yeah!

2069
02:01:17,536 --> 02:01:20,070
Oh.

2070
02:01:20,072 --> 02:01:20,804
Where is he?

2071
02:01:20,806 --> 02:01:22,406
No!
Wait, wait, wait.

2072
02:01:22,408 --> 02:01:23,574
Before you do anything,
Mister--

2073
02:01:23,576 --> 02:01:26,477
Doctor Strange, sir,
Peter's plan is working.

2074
02:01:26,479 --> 02:01:29,448
What plan?
He's curing them.

2075
02:01:37,690 --> 02:01:39,292
Dr. Connors?

2076
02:01:42,194 --> 02:01:44,163
Welcome back, sir.

2077
02:01:45,298 --> 02:01:47,500
Well, I'll be damned.

2078
02:01:49,335 --> 02:01:52,069
Did you just open a portal?

2079
02:01:52,071 --> 02:01:54,305
Yes-- Yes, sir, I did.

2080
02:01:54,307 --> 02:01:55,941
Hmm.

2081
02:02:01,314 --> 02:02:04,315
Max?

2082
02:02:04,317 --> 02:02:08,621
Don't worry. I'm all tapped out.
Are you sure about that?

2083
02:02:09,955 --> 02:02:11,188
Back to being a nobody.

2084
02:02:11,190 --> 02:02:15,359
You were never a nobody, Max.
Yes, I was. Yes, I was.

2085
02:02:15,361 --> 02:02:16,694
You didn't see me.

2086
02:02:17,596 --> 02:02:20,064
Can I tell you something,
though?

2087
02:02:20,066 --> 02:02:21,231
Yeah.

2088
02:02:21,233 --> 02:02:24,134
You got a nice face.
You're just a kid.

2089
02:02:24,136 --> 02:02:26,537
Ehh...
You're from Queens.

2090
02:02:26,539 --> 02:02:30,174
You got that suit.
You help a lot of poor people.

2091
02:02:30,176 --> 02:02:33,110
I just thought
you was gonna be Black.

2092
02:02:33,112 --> 02:02:35,312
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Oh, don't apologize.

2093
02:02:35,314 --> 02:02:39,885
There's gotta be a Black
Spider-Man somewhere out there.

2094
02:02:41,954 --> 02:02:44,156
Goddamn eels.

2095
02:02:46,792 --> 02:02:49,228
The power of the sun.

2096
02:02:51,464 --> 02:02:53,964
In the palm of your hand.

2097
02:02:53,966 --> 02:02:55,735
Peter?

2098
02:02:57,169 --> 02:02:58,838
Otto.

2099
02:02:59,271 --> 02:03:02,339
Oh, it's good to see you,
dear boy.

2100
02:03:02,341 --> 02:03:04,575
It's good to see you.

2101
02:03:04,577 --> 02:03:06,579
You're all grown up.

2102
02:03:07,546 --> 02:03:09,081
How are you?

2103
02:03:10,816 --> 02:03:12,418
Trying to do better.

2104
02:03:18,791 --> 02:03:20,491
Strange, wait, we're so close.
Skip it!

2105
02:03:20,493 --> 02:03:23,594
I've been dangling over
the Grand Canyon for 12 hours.

2106
02:03:23,596 --> 02:03:26,830
I know, I know, I know.
I, uh... Um... Uh...

2107
02:03:26,832 --> 02:03:29,166
I'm sorry about that, sir.
I mean...

2108
02:03:29,168 --> 02:03:32,603
You went to the Grand Canyon?
He could have used your help.

2109
02:03:32,605 --> 02:03:34,505
It's okay.
Uh, these are my new friends.

2110
02:03:34,507 --> 02:03:37,374
This is Peter Parker, Peter
Parker. Spider-Man, Spider-Man.

2111
02:03:37,376 --> 02:03:38,942
They're mes
from other universes.

2112
02:03:38,944 --> 02:03:40,210
No, no, no.
They're here to help.

2113
02:03:40,212 --> 02:03:41,578
He's the wizard
I told you about.

2114
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:42,846
Look, I am really impressed

2115
02:03:42,848 --> 02:03:46,750
that you've managed to give them
all a second chance, kid.

2116
02:03:46,752 --> 02:03:48,452
But this has to end. Now.

2117
02:03:48,454 --> 02:03:53,058
Can the Spider-Man
come out to play?

2118
02:04:14,513 --> 02:04:16,582
Strange, no!

2119
02:04:44,977 --> 02:04:46,679
Are you okay?

2120
02:04:47,379 --> 02:04:48,879
Yeah.

2121
02:04:48,881 --> 02:04:50,516
I'm okay.

2122
02:04:52,384 --> 02:04:54,019
Are you okay?

2123
02:05:10,936 --> 02:05:12,304
Whoa!

2124
02:06:10,863 --> 02:06:13,499
Thank you, Mr. Cape, sir.

2125
02:06:16,035 --> 02:06:17,570
Ned?

2126
02:06:18,170 --> 02:06:20,005
Ned!
Hey!

2127
02:06:23,809 --> 02:06:26,009
MJ!
Peter?

2128
02:06:26,011 --> 02:06:28,946
Ned!
Peter!

2129
02:06:28,948 --> 02:06:29,813
Hey!

2130
02:06:29,815 --> 02:06:32,585
Are you okay?
We're okay!

2131
02:06:46,231 --> 02:06:47,965
Poor Peter.

2132
02:06:47,967 --> 02:06:52,636
Too weak to send me home to die.

2133
02:06:52,638 --> 02:06:53,770
No.

2134
02:06:53,772 --> 02:06:56,807
I just wanna kill you myself.

2135
02:06:56,809 --> 02:06:58,609
Attaboy.

2136
02:08:47,386 --> 02:08:51,788
She was there because of you.

2137
02:08:51,790 --> 02:08:56,862
I may have struck the blow,
but you...

2138
02:08:58,697 --> 02:09:04,069
Ha-ha, you are the one
that killed her.

2139
02:09:30,763 --> 02:09:32,664
Peter.

2140
02:09:44,910 --> 02:09:46,678
What have I done?

2141
02:09:50,082 --> 02:09:51,414
It's you.
You okay?

2142
02:09:51,416 --> 02:09:55,051
Uh, yeah, I'm good.
I've been stabbed before.

2143
02:09:55,053 --> 02:09:56,920
Oh, good, good, good.
Hey.

2144
02:09:56,922 --> 02:09:59,992
Oh, man.
Hey, nice catch.

2145
02:10:00,325 --> 02:10:03,627
Nice throw.

2146
02:10:03,629 --> 02:10:06,363
What? Is that happening,
or am I dying?

2147
02:10:06,365 --> 02:10:08,131
- Yeah, that's happening.
- That's real.

2148
02:10:08,133 --> 02:10:10,836
Are there people in the sky?

2149
02:10:18,510 --> 02:10:21,814
I gotta go.
Yeah. I got it. You okay?

2150
02:10:25,584 --> 02:10:26,583
What's happening?

2151
02:10:26,585 --> 02:10:28,952
They're coming through.
I can't stop them.

2152
02:10:28,954 --> 02:10:30,587
There's gotta be
something we could do.

2153
02:10:30,589 --> 02:10:32,122
Can't you just
cast the spell again?

2154
02:10:32,124 --> 02:10:34,324
The original way,
before I screwed it up.

2155
02:10:34,326 --> 02:10:37,027
- We're too late for that.
- They're here.

2156
02:10:37,029 --> 02:10:39,832
They're here because of you.

2157
02:10:44,236 --> 02:10:46,570
What if everyone
forgot who I was?

2158
02:10:46,572 --> 02:10:47,204
What?

2159
02:10:47,206 --> 02:10:48,505
They're coming
because of me, right?

2160
02:10:48,507 --> 02:10:51,808
Because I'm Peter Parker?
So cast a new spell.

2161
02:10:51,810 --> 02:10:54,845
But this time, make everyone
forget who Peter Parker is.

2162
02:10:54,847 --> 02:10:57,182
Make everyone forget...

2163
02:10:58,317 --> 02:10:59,249
me.
No.

2164
02:10:59,251 --> 02:11:03,220
But it would work, right?
Yeah, it would work.

2165
02:11:03,222 --> 02:11:06,489
But you gotta understand,
that would mean that everyone

2166
02:11:06,491 --> 02:11:10,095
who knows and loves you, we...

2167
02:11:11,196 --> 02:11:14,032
We'd have no memory of you.

2168
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:17,903
It would be as though
you never existed.

2169
02:11:20,572 --> 02:11:22,341
I know.

2170
02:11:23,308 --> 02:11:25,010
Do it.

2171
02:11:27,346 --> 02:11:30,981
You better go and say your
goodbyes. You don't have long.

2172
02:11:30,983 --> 02:11:33,952
Thank you, sir.
Call me Stephen.

2173
02:11:36,755 --> 02:11:38,154
Thank you, Stephen.

2174
02:11:39,858 --> 02:11:43,362
Yeah. Still feels weird.

2175
02:11:45,464 --> 02:11:46,897
I'll see you around.

2176
02:11:48,634 --> 02:11:50,602
So long, kid.

2177
02:11:57,276 --> 02:12:00,076
Hey. Uh, I think this is it.

2178
02:12:00,078 --> 02:12:02,545
I think you're about to go home.
Okay.

2179
02:12:02,547 --> 02:12:06,251
All right.
Um, look, I, uh...

2180
02:12:07,419 --> 02:12:08,451
Thank you.

2181
02:12:08,453 --> 02:12:12,822
I just wanna-- I want you to--
I wanna tell you that--

2182
02:12:12,824 --> 02:12:14,691
I don't know how to say this.

2183
02:12:14,693 --> 02:12:17,262
Peter.
I want you to know that I...

2184
02:12:18,263 --> 02:12:21,466
You know. It's what we do.

2185
02:12:22,668 --> 02:12:25,168
Yeah, it's what we do. Um...

2186
02:12:25,170 --> 02:12:29,372
Right, I gotta find Ned and MJ.
I, uh...

2187
02:12:29,374 --> 02:12:32,244
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2188
02:12:35,681 --> 02:12:38,915
- I guess I'll see you.
- See you.

2189
02:12:38,917 --> 02:12:40,819
Bye.

2190
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:44,254
Oh...
You're in so much pain, huh?

2191
02:12:44,256 --> 02:12:45,791
I am.
Yeah.

2192
02:12:49,328 --> 02:12:51,394
Oh, you're okay. Oh!

2193
02:12:54,066 --> 02:12:56,933
Are you okay?
Yeah, we're okay.

2194
02:12:56,935 --> 02:12:59,269
Oh, my God, you're bleeding.
I'm fine. I'm okay.

2195
02:12:59,271 --> 02:13:01,371
You sure?
I'm fine, I promise.

2196
02:13:01,373 --> 02:13:03,206
Okay, okay.
I promise.

2197
02:13:03,208 --> 02:13:05,075
Good.

2198
02:13:05,077 --> 02:13:08,146
Um, we should go, right?

2199
02:13:09,715 --> 02:13:13,485
Yeah. You're gonna forget
who I am.

2200
02:13:14,686 --> 02:13:16,286
What?
Forget who you are?

2201
02:13:16,288 --> 02:13:18,221
What are you talking about?

2202
02:13:18,223 --> 02:13:21,424
It's okay.
I'm gonna come and find you,

2203
02:13:21,426 --> 02:13:23,895
and I'll explain everything.

2204
02:13:25,097 --> 02:13:27,530
I'll make you remember me.

2205
02:13:27,532 --> 02:13:30,266
And it'll be like none of this
ever happened. Okay?

2206
02:13:30,268 --> 02:13:33,636
But what if that doesn't work?
What if that doesn't work?

2207
02:13:33,638 --> 02:13:36,873
What if we can't remember you?
I don't wanna do that.

2208
02:13:36,875 --> 02:13:39,509
I don't wanna do that.
I know. MJ, I know.

2209
02:13:39,511 --> 02:13:43,680
There's not something we can do?
We can't come up with a plan?

2210
02:13:43,682 --> 02:13:46,852
There's always
something we can do.

2211
02:13:47,352 --> 02:13:49,821
There's nothing we can do.

2212
02:13:53,325 --> 02:13:55,427
But it'll be okay.

2213
02:13:58,930 --> 02:14:00,332
You promise?

2214
02:14:03,001 --> 02:14:05,003
Yeah, I promise.

2215
02:14:15,514 --> 02:14:17,847
I'll come find you, okay?

2216
02:14:17,849 --> 02:14:19,918
I know you will.

2217
02:14:20,485 --> 02:14:22,554
Okay.
Okay.

2218
02:14:24,122 --> 02:14:25,891
You better.

2219
02:14:26,825 --> 02:14:28,925
If you don't,
I'll just figure it out.

2220
02:14:28,927 --> 02:14:32,264
I've done it before,
I can do it again.

2221
02:14:32,731 --> 02:14:35,167
I promise I'll fix this.

2222
02:14:35,767 --> 02:14:37,869
I really hate magic.

2223
02:14:38,737 --> 02:14:40,672
Yeah. Me too.

2224
02:14:44,676 --> 02:14:46,178
I love you.

2225
02:14:51,950 --> 02:14:54,117
I love--
Just wait.

2226
02:14:54,119 --> 02:14:57,556
Wait and tell me
when you see me again.

2227
02:14:59,157 --> 02:15:00,859
Sure.

2228
02:16:27,245 --> 02:16:29,514
I love you.

2229
02:17:06,518 --> 02:17:08,885
It's been a few weeks
since the fiasco

2230
02:17:08,887 --> 02:17:11,521
on the Statue of Liberty,
and Spider-Man's cultists

2231
02:17:11,523 --> 02:17:16,593
continue to contend that
the vile vigilante is a hero.

2232
02:17:16,595 --> 02:17:19,062
Well, if he were a hero,
he'd unmask himself

2233
02:17:19,064 --> 02:17:20,797
and tell us who he really is,

2234
02:17:20,799 --> 02:17:24,434
because only a coward
conceals his identity.

2235
02:17:24,436 --> 02:17:27,637
Only a coward hides
his true intentions.

2236
02:17:27,639 --> 02:17:29,872
Rest assured,
ladies and gentlemen,

2237
02:17:29,874 --> 02:17:32,775
this reporter will uncover
those intentions

2238
02:17:32,777 --> 02:17:33,977
come hell or high water.

2239
02:17:33,979 --> 02:17:40,218
Hi. My name is Peter Parker.
You don't know me, but I, uh...

2240
02:17:40,986 --> 02:17:42,452
Hi, my name is Peter Parker,

2241
02:17:42,454 --> 02:17:45,056
and you don't know me, but you--

2242
02:17:47,592 --> 02:17:49,425
Okay, come on.

2243
02:17:50,462 --> 02:17:52,762
No way.
Hard to believe, isn't it?

2244
02:18:02,540 --> 02:18:04,175
Hey.

2245
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:10,847
One sec. Can I help you?

2246
02:18:10,849 --> 02:18:16,288
Hi. Um, my name
is Peter Parker, and I...

2247
02:18:19,257 --> 02:18:22,692
would like a coffee, please.

2248
02:18:22,694 --> 02:18:25,194
Okay, no problem, Peter Parker.

2249
02:18:31,803 --> 02:18:34,037
Doughnut for
my fellow Engineer.

2250
02:18:34,039 --> 02:18:35,605
Oh! Wait, what?

2251
02:18:35,607 --> 02:18:37,507
MIT, they're the Engineers.
The mascot.

2252
02:18:37,509 --> 02:18:40,376
Oh, right, right, right.
I should probably know that.

2253
02:18:40,378 --> 02:18:42,645
Look at you
with the school spirit.

2254
02:18:42,647 --> 02:18:44,947
Tell anybody, I will deny it.

2255
02:18:44,949 --> 02:18:46,951
Oh, okay.

2256
02:18:55,960 --> 02:18:59,195
Peter Parker? Peter Parker.

2257
02:18:59,197 --> 02:19:00,163
Your coffee.

2258
02:19:00,165 --> 02:19:02,165
Right. Thank you.
Mm-hm.

2259
02:19:02,167 --> 02:19:03,668
Um...

2260
02:19:04,669 --> 02:19:07,272
Are you excited for MIT?

2261
02:19:07,739 --> 02:19:09,339
Oh, uh, right. Yeah.

2262
02:19:09,341 --> 02:19:12,809
Uh, yeah. Actually,
I am excited, which is weird,

2263
02:19:12,811 --> 02:19:15,678
'cause I don't really
get excited about things.

2264
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:16,946
I kind of expect disappointment.

2265
02:19:16,948 --> 02:19:21,084
'Cause then you'll never
actually be disappointed.

2266
02:19:21,086 --> 02:19:23,086
Right?

2267
02:19:23,088 --> 02:19:24,821
Uh...

2268
02:19:24,823 --> 02:19:26,991
yeah. Right.

2269
02:19:27,492 --> 02:19:29,892
I don't know, it kind of
feels different

2270
02:19:29,894 --> 02:19:32,364
this time for some reason.

2271
02:19:42,741 --> 02:19:44,542
Right. Um...

2272
02:19:45,009 --> 02:19:47,343
What I was--

2273
02:19:56,187 --> 02:19:58,054
You okay?

2274
02:19:58,056 --> 02:20:00,925
It doesn't really hurt anymore.

2275
02:20:10,869 --> 02:20:13,872
Is there anything else?

2276
02:20:25,884 --> 02:20:27,419
No.

2277
02:20:30,555 --> 02:20:32,522
Thank you.

2278
02:20:32,524 --> 02:20:34,359
No problem.

2279
02:20:39,798 --> 02:20:42,398
I'll, uh, see you around.

2280
02:21:46,431 --> 02:21:48,533
How'd you know her?

2281
02:21:51,536 --> 02:21:53,870
Through Spider-Man.

2282
02:21:53,872 --> 02:21:54,937
You?

2283
02:21:54,939 --> 02:21:56,541
Same.

2284
02:22:01,045 --> 02:22:04,013
I lost a good friend
a while back.

2285
02:22:04,015 --> 02:22:06,017
Felt like this.

2286
02:22:06,985 --> 02:22:10,052
It hurts 'cause they're gone
and then it hurts all over again

2287
02:22:10,054 --> 02:22:12,054
because you remember
what they stood for

2288
02:22:12,056 --> 02:22:16,227
and you wonder,
"Is all that gone too?"

2289
02:22:20,131 --> 02:22:22,233
No, it's not gone.

2290
02:22:24,269 --> 02:22:26,871
Everyone that she helped...

2291
02:22:28,439 --> 02:22:30,940
they'll keep it going.

2292
02:22:30,942 --> 02:22:32,944
You really think so?

2293
02:22:33,645 --> 02:22:35,046
I know it.

2294
02:22:36,014 --> 02:22:40,585
Take care of yourself, okay?
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

2295
02:22:46,491 --> 02:22:51,896
Rent is due on the first
of the month. Don't be late.

2296
02:23:41,145 --> 02:23:44,280
Four-three-Edward,
do you need an EMS assist?

2297
02:23:44,282 --> 02:23:46,082
Negative, Central.

02:27:04,782 --> 02:27:05,981
Okay, I think I got this.

2369
02:27:05,983 --> 02:27:10,252
You're saying that
this whole place here,

2370
02:27:10,254 --> 02:27:12,757
it's just tons of...

2371
02:27:13,391 --> 02:27:14,089
superpeople.

2372
02:27:14,091 --> 02:27:17,726
And he has been saying it
for hours.

2373
02:27:17,728 --> 02:27:21,497
All right, tell me again.
I'm sorry, I'm an idiot.

2374
02:27:21,499 --> 02:27:22,498
There was a billionaire,

2375
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:25,937
he had a tin suit
and he could fly, right?

2376
02:27:27,171 --> 02:27:30,773
Okay, and there was
a really angry green man.

2377
02:27:30,775 --> 02:27:31,974
Hulk.
Hulk.

2378
02:27:31,976 --> 02:27:34,844
And you thought Lethal
Protector was a shit name.

2379
02:27:34,846 --> 02:27:37,012
Yeah, because it is.

2380
02:27:37,014 --> 02:27:37,913
Now tell me again

2381
02:27:37,915 --> 02:27:40,716
about your purple alien
that loves stones.

2382
02:27:40,718 --> 02:27:43,719
'Cause I'll tell you what, man,
aliens do not love stones.

2383
02:27:43,721 --> 02:27:45,821
Eddie, don't start.
They don't.

2384
02:27:45,823 --> 02:27:47,957
Know what aliens love?
Eating brains.

2385
02:27:47,959 --> 02:27:50,259
Because that's what they do.
All right?

2386
02:27:50,261 --> 02:27:53,764
Señor, he made
my family disappear.

2387
02:27:54,699 --> 02:27:56,234
For five years.

2388
02:27:57,268 --> 02:27:58,703
Five years?

2389
02:28:00,404 --> 02:28:02,106
That's a long time.

2390
02:28:04,175 --> 02:28:05,007
Maybe I...

2391
02:28:05,009 --> 02:28:08,913
Maybe I should go to New York
and speak to this...

2392
02:28:10,014 --> 02:28:10,746
Spider-Man.

2393
02:28:10,748 --> 02:28:14,585
Eddie, we are drunk.

2394
02:28:15,353 --> 02:28:16,418
Let's go skinny-dip!

2395
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:18,287
I don't think
we should skinny-dip.

2396
02:28:18,289 --> 02:28:20,122
You have to pay the bill.

2397
02:28:20,124 --> 02:28:21,357
What is happening? No!

2398
02:28:21,359 --> 02:28:24,695
No, we just got here!
No, not again!

2399
02:28:28,799 --> 02:28:30,232
And there he goes.

2400
02:28:30,234 --> 02:28:34,138
Without paying the bill,
no tips, nothing.

2401
02:35:41,332 --> 02:35:43,665
Seniors, don't forget
to schedule

2402
02:35:43,667 --> 02:35:45,934
your graduation photo pickup.

2403
02:35:45,936 --> 02:35:48,570
Cafeteria safety is no joke.

2404
02:35:50,474 --> 02:35:51,673
Respect the signs,

2405
02:35:51,675 --> 02:35:52,874
or pay the consequences.

2406
02:35:52,876 --> 02:35:56,144
This has been a message from
the Cafeteria Safety Council.

2407
02:35:56,146 --> 02:35:59,948
And now, Betty's Corner,
with Betty Brant.

2408
02:35:59,950 --> 02:36:02,351
It seems like only yesterday

2409
02:36:02,353 --> 02:36:03,685
that we were just starting

2410
02:36:03,687 --> 02:36:06,154
the adventure
that we call high school.

2411
02:36:06,156 --> 02:36:09,825
And what an adventure
it's been.

2412
02:36:09,827 --> 02:36:11,493
We learned new things.

2413
02:36:11,495 --> 02:36:13,462
We traveled the world.

2414
02:36:13,464 --> 02:36:14,930
We fell in love.

2415
02:36:14,932 --> 02:36:17,799
We almost died. Multiple times.

2416
02:36:17,801 --> 02:36:20,635
We made friendships
that will last forever.

2417
02:36:20,637 --> 02:36:22,204
Also, some of us disappeared

2418
02:36:22,206 --> 02:36:23,772
for five years
and then reappeared.

2419
02:36:23,774 --> 02:36:26,508
But the less we talk
about that, the better.

2420
02:36:26,510 --> 02:36:29,478
What's important
is that we made it.

2421
02:36:29,480 --> 02:36:30,512
And as we look out

2422
02:36:30,514 --> 02:36:34,516
on to an exciting and uncertain
future, just remember:

2423
02:36:34,518 --> 02:36:37,586
The memories we've made here
at Midtown High

2424
02:36:37,588 --> 02:36:41,291
are the ones
that we will cherish forever.

2425
02:36:43,093 --> 02:36:44,393
That's Midtown News for today,

2426
02:36:44,395 --> 02:36:47,996
and for one last time,
this has been Betty Brant.

2427
02:36:47,998 --> 02:36:49,433
Signing off.

2428
02:36:49,800 --> 02:36:52,334
Happy graduation! Go Tigers!
