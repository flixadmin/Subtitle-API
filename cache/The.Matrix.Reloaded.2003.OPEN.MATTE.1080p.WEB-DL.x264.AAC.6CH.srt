1
00:01:27,824 --> 00:01:29,656
See you tomorrow.

2
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,005
Oh, my God!

3
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,151
I'm in.

4
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:09,058
We're almost there.

5
00:04:09,232 --> 00:04:13,192
- Sir, are you sure about this?
- I told you, we're going to be all right.

6
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:16,271
I understand, sir. It's
just that I'm scoping

7
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:18,823
some serious sentinel
activity up here.

8
00:04:56,987 --> 00:04:59,400
- Link.
- Yes, sir?

9
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:02,690
Given your situation, I can't say
I understand your reasons...

10
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:05,530
for volunteering to operate
onboard my ship.

11
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:09,698
However, if you wish to continue to
do so, I must ask you to do one thing.

12
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,707
What's that, sir?

13
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,746
To trust me.

14
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,877
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

15
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:21,088
- I mean, I do, sir.
- I hope so.

16
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:24,628
Repatch the main AC to the hard drives
and stand by to broadcast.

17
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:25,886
Yes, sir.

18
00:05:34,732 --> 00:05:36,974
Still can't sleep?

19
00:05:38,944 --> 00:05:40,310
You wanna talk?

20
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:45,023
They're just dreams.

21
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:49,736
If you're afraid of something...

22
00:05:49,913 --> 00:05:51,745
I just wish...

23
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,658
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.

24
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:56,667
That's all.

25
00:05:57,588 --> 00:05:59,170
I just wish I knew.

26
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,584
She's gonna call. Don't worry.

27
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:04,796
Here you are.

28
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:08,428
- Are we ready to go?
- We're already late.

29
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:13,218
These geotherms confirm
the last transmission of the <i>Osiris.</i>

30
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:15,640
The machines are digging.

31
00:06:17,315 --> 00:06:19,602
They're boring from the surface
down to Zion.

32
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:22,359
- Mother...
- They'll avoid the perimeter defense.

33
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:24,019
How fast are they moving?

34
00:06:24,197 --> 00:06:27,565
Control estimates their descent
at 100 meters an hour.

35
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:30,200
- How deep are they?
- Almost 2000 meters.

36
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,909
- What about the scans from the <i>Osiris</i>?
- They can't be accurate.

37
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:35,994
- They may be.
- It's not possible.

38
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,625
That'd mean there are
a quarter-million sentinels.

39
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:40,286
- That's right.
- That can't be.

40
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:42,125
Why not?

41
00:06:42,298 --> 00:06:46,042
A sentinel for every man,
woman and child in Zion.

42
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,970
That sounds exactly like
the thinking of a machine to me.

43
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:53,301
Morpheus, glad you could join us.

44
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:54,970
Niobe.

45
00:06:56,353 --> 00:06:59,721
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware...

46
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:03,187
it's become difficult to locate
a secure broadcast position.

47
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,603
- Squiddies got our best spots.
- Lines are crawling with them.

48
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,569
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours
there's gonna be a quarter-million more.

49
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:11,858
What are we gonna do?

50
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:14,322
We're gonna do what
Commander Lock ordered.

51
00:07:14,663 --> 00:07:17,246
We'll evacuate broadcast level
and return to Zion.

52
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:22,536
And does the commander have a plan
for stopping 250,000 sentinels?

53
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:25,375
A strategy is still being formulated.

54
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:27,211
I'm sure it is.

55
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:44,223
What do you think
we should do, Morpheus?

56
00:07:44,442 --> 00:07:46,559
- Proceed as ordered...
- What is it?

57
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:47,771
I don't know.

58
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:50,733
However, I must
ask one of you for help.

59
00:07:50,906 --> 00:07:56,618
Some of you believe as I believe, some
of you do not. Those of you that do...

60
00:07:56,787 --> 00:07:59,325
know we are nearing
the end of our struggle.

61
00:07:59,498 --> 00:08:03,742
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be...

62
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,253
the Oracle must be consulted.

63
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,422
If we return and recharge now...

64
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,343
we can be back in 36 hours, well
before the machines reach this depth.

65
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:23,393
Do you understand what you're asking?

66
00:08:23,563 --> 00:08:26,397
I am asking that one ship
remain here in our place...

67
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:29,274
in case the Oracle
should attempt to contact us.

68
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:32,562
Bullshit. You're asking one of us
to disobey a direct order.

69
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:37,279
That's right, I am. But we well know
that the reason most of us are here...

70
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:40,069
is because of our affinity
for disobedience.

71
00:08:40,246 --> 00:08:42,158
What happens when you
get back to Zion...

72
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:44,745
and the commander
throws you in the stockade?

73
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:46,125
He won't.

74
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:50,462
Goddamn it, Morpheus,
you ain't never gonna change.

75
00:08:51,174 --> 00:08:53,916
Shit, I'll do it just to see
what Deadbolt does to you.

76
00:08:54,092 --> 00:08:55,628
You got 36 hours.

77
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,262
I'm looking for Neo.

78
00:09:00,432 --> 00:09:03,800
- Never heard of him.
- I have something for him.

79
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,228
A gift.

80
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:10,307
You see, he set me free.

81
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:14,978
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.

82
00:09:15,531 --> 00:09:16,567
Who was that?

83
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,572
How did you know someone was here?

84
00:09:18,742 --> 00:09:20,199
He gave you this.

85
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,369
He said you set him free.

86
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,669
Is everything all right, sir?

87
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:34,664
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.

88
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,048
- Agents are coming.
- Agents?

89
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,876
Go.

90
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,769
Hiya, fellas.

91
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:51,208
- It's him.
- The anomaly.

92
00:09:51,232 --> 00:09:52,473
- Do we proceed?
- Yes.

93
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,142
- He is still...
- Only human.

94
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:03,567
Hm. Upgrades.

95
00:10:58,506 --> 00:11:01,043
- That went as expected.
- Yes.

96
00:11:01,216 --> 00:11:03,879
It's happening exactly as before.

97
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:06,716
Well, not exactly.

98
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:12,551
- What happened?
- I can't figure it out.

99
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:14,390
Agents just came out of nowhere.

100
00:11:14,563 --> 00:11:17,556
Then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.

101
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:20,646
- Is Neo okay?
- Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.

102
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:22,230
Where is he now?

103
00:11:23,697 --> 00:11:25,438
He's doing his Superman thing.

104
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:16,872
Where are you?

105
00:12:21,546 --> 00:12:25,129
This is the <i>Nebuchadnezzar,</i>
requesting access through Gate Three.

106
00:12:29,177 --> 00:12:33,638
<i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by.

107
00:12:33,807 --> 00:12:35,298
<i>Roger that, Control.</i>

108
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:38,968
This is Control requesting immediate
stand-down of arms at Gate Three.

109
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:42,980
We have the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>
on approach. Let's open her up.

110
00:12:48,572 --> 00:12:51,485
<i>You are cleared through
Gate Three to Bay Seven.</i>

111
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:53,365
Roger that, Control.

112
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,584
Door's open, bed's made.
Welcome home.

113
00:13:04,337 --> 00:13:06,499
No place like it.

114
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:24,396
Roger that, Control. Zion Control,
stand by for Gate Three lockdown.

115
00:14:13,905 --> 00:14:16,318
<i>The</i> Nebuchadnezzar <i>is down.
Bay Seven.</i>

116
00:14:16,491 --> 00:14:17,652
Understood.

117
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:28,913
Captain Mifune.

118
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:31,165
Captain Morpheus.

119
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:34,172
Are you here to escort me
to the stockade, captain?

120
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:36,781
- I'm just here to keep the peace.
- Commander Lock demands...

121
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:42,176
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.

122
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,932
- Link.
- Sir?

123
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:47,685
I want the ship ready to go
as soon as possible.

124
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:49,391
Understood, sir.

125
00:14:56,572 --> 00:14:58,985
- What is it between them?
- Morpheus and Lock?

126
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:02,279
- Niobe.
- Captain Niobe?

127
00:15:02,452 --> 00:15:05,661
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.

128
00:15:06,915 --> 00:15:08,497
What happened?

129
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:12,123
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.

130
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:14,958
Yeah, she can do that.

131
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:16,292
Neo!

132
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,168
- Oh, no.
- How does he always know?

133
00:15:20,344 --> 00:15:22,301
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

134
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:25,179
You know what they say
about the life you save.

135
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:27,136
I didn't save his life.

136
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:30,678
Hiya, Neo.

137
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:34,473
- Trinity, Link.
- Hey.

138
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,314
- It's great to have you back.
- Thanks. It's good to be back.

139
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:41,230
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, I can carry my own bag.

140
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,069
- Trinity?
- I'm fine.

141
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:46,903
- You can carry these.
- Yeah, sure, Link.

142
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:56,329
Hey, you know, next year
I'm old enough to join a crew, right?

143
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:59,247
I've been thinking about it,
and I've made my decision.

144
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:00,881
Let me guess.

145
00:16:01,384 --> 00:16:03,341
I want to join the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

146
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:07,885
Morpheus hasn't filled the other
positions, except for you, Link.

147
00:16:08,058 --> 00:16:09,424
I'm sure he has reasons...

148
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,935
but the more I think about it,
the more I think it's meant to be.

149
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:14,640
You know, it's fate.

150
00:16:14,814 --> 00:16:16,350
You're the reason I'm here, Neo.

151
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:19,062
I told you, you found me.
I didn't find you.

152
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:21,773
I know, but you got me out.
You saved me.

153
00:16:22,906 --> 00:16:24,522
You saved yourself.

154
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:44,128
- Morpheus.
- Commander Lock.

155
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:48,880
I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to
offer you a chance to explain your actions.

156
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:51,924
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

157
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:54,388
You were given an order
to return to Zion.

158
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:57,395
- I did.
- You asked for one ship to remain behind.

159
00:16:57,564 --> 00:17:00,227
I would have stayed,
but I needed to recharge my ship.

160
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:03,109
So you admit to a direct contravention
of your duty.

161
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,692
We need a presence inside the Matrix
to await contact from the Oracle.

162
00:17:06,865 --> 00:17:08,822
I don't want to hear that shit!

163
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:11,656
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs!

164
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:15,243
Stopping that
army from destroying this city.

165
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,250
To do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.

166
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:23,004
With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.

167
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:24,583
How?

168
00:17:24,757 --> 00:17:27,545
- Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.

169
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:30,336
Not everyone believes what you believe.

170
00:17:30,513 --> 00:17:32,596
My beliefs do not require them to.

171
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:44,687
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's
talking. A lot of people are scared.

172
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:47,604
No one remembers the last time
so many ships were docked.

173
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,739
- Something big is happening, isn't it?
- Hey.

174
00:17:50,908 --> 00:17:54,072
We're not allowed to say anything,
so stop asking.

175
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,493
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

176
00:18:15,515 --> 00:18:18,474
I'm recommending that you
be removed from duty.

177
00:18:18,643 --> 00:18:20,976
That is, of course,
your prerogative, commander.

178
00:18:21,146 --> 00:18:25,015
If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot
on a ship for the rest of your life.

179
00:18:25,192 --> 00:18:27,935
Then I am grateful that
it is not up to you.

180
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:36,822
- Councillor Hamann.
- Commander.

181
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:40,204
- Captain.
- Councillor.

182
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:43,741
Council's asked me to speak tonight
at the temple gathering.

183
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,003
The presence of the fleet and the
persistence of rumors must be addressed.

184
00:18:48,172 --> 00:18:50,664
The people must be told
what is happening.

185
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:52,548
Of course, councillor.

186
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,506
But might I advise a level of discretion
concerning specific details.

187
00:18:58,682 --> 00:19:01,675
- We do not wish to start a panic.
- Quite right.

188
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:04,936
A panic is not what anyone wants.

189
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:08,440
What about you, captain?
What would you advise?

190
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:15,606
The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.

191
00:19:15,783 --> 00:19:17,900
That army won't reach
the gates of Zion.

192
00:19:18,702 --> 00:19:22,286
- What makes you so sure?
- Consider what we have seen, councillor.

193
00:19:22,456 --> 00:19:24,322
Consider that in the past six months...

194
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,537
we have freed more minds
than in six years.

195
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,702
This attack is an act of desperation.

196
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:33,714
I believe very soon the prophecy
will be fulfilled and this war will end.

197
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:37,710
I hope you're right, captain.

198
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:40,595
I do not believe it to be
a matter of hope, councillor.

199
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:43,348
It is simply a matter of time.

200
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,977
My stop.

201
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:48,558
See you soon.

202
00:19:48,731 --> 00:19:50,188
Hopefully not too soon.

203
00:19:50,358 --> 00:19:53,522
Let's go, kid.
These two got things to do.

204
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:04,695
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

205
00:20:04,873 --> 00:20:07,286
I am if you're thinking
this elevator is too slow.

206
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,791
- How long do we charge the <i>Neb</i>?
- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.

207
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:15,171
Some people go their entire lives
without hearing news that good.

208
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:43,950
Neo, please, I have a son,
Jacob, aboard the <i>Gnosis.</i>

209
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:47,612
- Please, watch over him.
- I'll try.

210
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,872
I have a daughter on the <i>Icarus.</i>

211
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,953
No, wait.

212
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,618
It's all right. They need you.

213
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,037
- I need you.
- I know.

214
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,877
There's time.

215
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,964
Where's my puss...?

216
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,474
- Hey!
- Uncle Link!

217
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,260
God!

218
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,394
Uncle Link!

219
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:17,148
Oh, my God! You're so huge!

220
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,480
- You should be picking me up!
- No!

221
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,190
- Yeah!
- Okay!

222
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,071
Okay? All right.

223
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:26,279
Now, we're gonna have
to work together here, okay?

224
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,660
One, two, three, lift!

225
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,993
Oh, my God!
What are you feeding these two?

226
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,874
Come on, kids. It's time to go.

227
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,002
- Hey, Cas.
- Hey.

228
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:41,084
- Good to have you home, Link.
- Good to be home.

229
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,090
You be careful with her.

230
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,048
Don't worry about me.
He's the one that's gonna get it.

231
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,256
Out the door! Both of you, march!

232
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:52,470
- Bye!
- Bye!

233
00:21:58,858 --> 00:22:00,394
I'm gonna get what?

234
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:05,780
Every ship up there's been home two, even
three times more than the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

235
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,784
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.

236
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:13,367
- We'll be when you operate another ship.
- I can't do that.

237
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,031
- Why?
- You know why.

238
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,371
If Dozer knew how I felt,
he wouldn't have asked you to do this.

239
00:22:19,086 --> 00:22:21,624
Maybe. But it's too late now.

240
00:22:21,797 --> 00:22:24,414
I made a promise,
and some promises can't be unmade.

241
00:22:24,591 --> 00:22:27,299
- It's not fair.
- Nobody said it was gonna be.

242
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:30,428
You think Cas thinks it's fair
that I'm here and Dozer's not?

243
00:22:36,353 --> 00:22:39,562
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.

244
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:42,857
I'm afraid of it.

245
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:47,062
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.

246
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,572
It won't.

247
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:51,574
How can you say that to me?

248
00:22:51,744 --> 00:22:53,701
Because of Morpheus.

249
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:58,491
Because of what he's told me. He said
that this is it, that it will be over soon.

250
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:02,876
- Link, Morpheus is crazy.
- No doubt.

251
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:06,588
But Tank and Dozer believed him.
And I'll tell you what...

252
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:12,095
after being on that ship and seeing Neo
do the things he can do, I gotta say...

253
00:23:12,263 --> 00:23:14,300
I'm starting to believe him too.

254
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:21,850
Be careful, Link.

255
00:23:27,195 --> 00:23:29,562
Please be careful.

256
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:42,078
- They started yet?
- Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.

257
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:45,334
Tonight, let us honor
these men and women.

258
00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:48,121
These are our soldiers, our warriors.

259
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:52,542
These are our husbands and wives,
our brothers and sisters...

260
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:54,381
our children.

261
00:23:54,971 --> 00:23:58,089
Let us remember those
that have been lost...

262
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:01,475
and let us give thanks
for those that have been found...

263
00:24:01,645 --> 00:24:04,934
and who stand here beside us.

264
00:24:05,148 --> 00:24:08,812
Now I would like someone else
to close this prayer...

265
00:24:08,985 --> 00:24:12,194
someone who hasn't spoken here
in a long time...

266
00:24:12,364 --> 00:24:17,735
but who I believe has something to say
that we all need to hear.

267
00:24:18,745 --> 00:24:20,327
I give you Morpheus.

268
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:44,014
Zion! Hear me!

269
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,138
It is true what many of you have heard.

270
00:24:48,315 --> 00:24:52,309
The machines have gathered
an army, and as I speak...

271
00:24:52,486 --> 00:24:56,400
that army is drawing nearer to our home.

272
00:24:57,867 --> 00:25:02,532
Believe me when I say we have
a difficult time ahead of us.

273
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:09,371
But if we are to be prepared for it,
we must first shed our fear of it.

274
00:25:09,878 --> 00:25:14,794
I stand here before you now
truthfully unafraid.

275
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:17,124
Why?

276
00:25:17,552 --> 00:25:20,386
Because I believe something you do not?

277
00:25:20,555 --> 00:25:22,387
No!

278
00:25:22,682 --> 00:25:27,643
I stand here without fear
because I remember.

279
00:25:27,812 --> 00:25:31,726
I remember that I am here not because
of the path that lies before me...

280
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,234
but because of the path
that lies behind me.

281
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:40,068
I remember that for 100 years
we have fought these machines.

282
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:44,986
I remember that for 100 years
they have sent their armies to destroy us.

283
00:25:45,163 --> 00:25:51,250
And after a century of war,
I remember that which matters most:

284
00:25:52,127 --> 00:25:55,120
We are still here!

285
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:03,928
Tonight...

286
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:07,465
let us send a message to that army.

287
00:26:07,643 --> 00:26:10,681
Tonight, let us shake this cave.

288
00:26:10,854 --> 00:26:14,723
Tonight, let us tremble these halls...

289
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,018
of earth, steel and stone.

290
00:26:18,195 --> 00:26:23,441
Let us be heard from red core
to black sky.

291
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:28,157
Tonight, let us make them remember:

292
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:33,290
This is Zion and we are not afraid!

293
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,641
I remember.

294
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,898
I remember you used to dance.

295
00:27:03,531 --> 00:27:06,820
I remember you were pretty good.

296
00:27:07,577 --> 00:27:10,820
There are some things in this world,
Captain Niobe...

297
00:27:11,622 --> 00:27:14,409
that will never change.

298
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:17,621
Niobe!

299
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,081
Some things do change.

300
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,193
Excuse me.

301
00:27:57,041 --> 00:28:00,534
- I missed you.
- I can tell.

302
00:28:01,003 --> 00:28:04,713
I was thinking, everyone is here.

303
00:28:05,257 --> 00:28:07,544
Follow me.

304
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:32,123
Neo, what is it?

305
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:34,659
What's wrong?

306
00:31:36,255 --> 00:31:38,588
It's okay, you can tell me.

307
00:31:38,966 --> 00:31:41,458
Trinity...

308
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:44,423
Don't be afraid.

309
00:31:44,596 --> 00:31:46,929
I can't lose you.

310
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:48,965
You're not gonna lose me.

311
00:31:53,105 --> 00:31:55,973
You feel this?

312
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:57,936
I'm never letting go.

313
00:32:35,146 --> 00:32:37,809
Good night, Zion.

314
00:32:37,982 --> 00:32:40,645
Sweet dreams.

315
00:32:50,828 --> 00:32:52,490
- You all right?
- I'll make it.

316
00:32:52,663 --> 00:32:55,279
Did you see that agent?
I've never seen anything like that.

317
00:32:55,457 --> 00:32:57,540
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is this.

318
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,996
You first.

319
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:13,757
- Oh, God.
- "Smith" will suffice.

320
00:33:25,695 --> 00:33:28,984
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

321
00:34:18,955 --> 00:34:22,244
- Care for some company?
- Councillor Hamann.

322
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:25,960
I don't want to intrude
if you'd prefer to be alone.

323
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:29,960
- No, I could probably use some company.
- Good.

324
00:34:30,425 --> 00:34:32,792
So could I.

325
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,422
It's nice tonight.

326
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:41,346
Very calm.

327
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:44,262
It feels like everyone is sleeping
very peacefully.

328
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:47,105
Not everyone.

329
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:52,111
I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.

330
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,320
I figure I slept the first 11 years
of my life, now I'm making up for it.

331
00:34:56,784 --> 00:35:01,494
- What about you?
- I just haven't been able to sleep much.

332
00:35:02,956 --> 00:35:06,120
- It's a good sign.
- Of what?

333
00:35:06,293 --> 00:35:09,457
That you are in fact still human.

334
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:16,964
Have you ever been
to the engineering level?

335
00:35:17,137 --> 00:35:20,175
I love to walk there at night.
It's quite amazing.

336
00:35:20,348 --> 00:35:22,886
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

337
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:38,031
Almost no one comes down here.
Unless, of course, there's a problem.

338
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,285
That's how it is with people. Nobody cares
how it works as long as it works.

339
00:35:43,454 --> 00:35:45,741
I like it down here.

340
00:35:45,915 --> 00:35:51,707
I like to be reminded this city survives
because of these machines.

341
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:56,999
These machines are keeping us alive
while other machines are coming to kill us.

342
00:35:57,426 --> 00:36:02,262
Interesting, isn't it?
The power to give life...

343
00:36:02,431 --> 00:36:05,640
- and the power to end it.
- We have the same power.

344
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,518
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...

345
00:36:08,687 --> 00:36:12,146
sometimes I think about those people
still plugged into the Matrix.

346
00:36:12,316 --> 00:36:15,309
And when I look at these machines...

347
00:36:15,486 --> 00:36:20,572
I can't help thinking that, in a way,
we are plugged into them.

348
00:36:20,866 --> 00:36:23,734
But we control these machines,
they don't control us.

349
00:36:24,161 --> 00:36:27,153
Of course not. How could they?

350
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,868
The idea is pure nonsense...

351
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:33,493
but it does make one wonder just...

352
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,252
what is control?

353
00:36:35,505 --> 00:36:38,543
If we wanted, we could
shut these machines down.

354
00:36:38,925 --> 00:36:43,386
Of course. That's it. You hit it.
That's control, isn't it?

355
00:36:44,013 --> 00:36:47,381
If we wanted,
we could smash them to bits.

356
00:36:47,642 --> 00:36:51,761
Although if we did, we'd have to consider
what would happen to our lights...

357
00:36:51,938 --> 00:36:54,601
our heat, our air.

358
00:36:55,608 --> 00:36:59,727
So we need machines and they need us.
Is that your point, councillor?

359
00:36:59,904 --> 00:37:02,521
No. No point.

360
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:07,325
Old men like me don't bother
with making points. There's no point.

361
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,909
Is that why there are no young men
on the Council?

362
00:37:12,082 --> 00:37:13,744
Good point.

363
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:18,624
Why don't you tell me
what's on your mind, councillor.

364
00:37:18,797 --> 00:37:22,040
There is so much in this world...

365
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:25,130
that I do not understand.

366
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:31,675
See that machine? It has something to do
with recycling our water supply.

367
00:37:31,852 --> 00:37:34,845
I have absolutely no idea how it works.

368
00:37:35,022 --> 00:37:39,107
But I do understand the reason
for it to work.

369
00:37:40,611 --> 00:37:45,106
I have absolutely no idea how you
are able to do some of the things you do.

370
00:37:46,283 --> 00:37:49,446
But I believe there's a reason for that
as well.

371
00:37:50,328 --> 00:37:55,448
I only hope we understand that reason
before it's too late.

372
00:38:01,964 --> 00:38:03,626
- Ballard.
- Is he here?

373
00:38:06,052 --> 00:38:08,635
Neo, it's from the Oracle.

374
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,306
It's time to go.

375
00:38:14,268 --> 00:38:16,726
Morpheus said this was how
it was gonna happen.

376
00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:21,311
I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true,
maybe it's not.

377
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:25,023
All I know is, that ship needs an operator.

378
00:38:26,614 --> 00:38:28,480
Right now, that operator's me.

379
00:38:29,116 --> 00:38:31,199
I know.

380
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:37,826
- Zee...
- I want you to wear it.

381
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:41,083
- You know I don't believe in this stuff.
- But I do.

382
00:38:41,378 --> 00:38:44,337
It's always brought me luck.

383
00:38:44,506 --> 00:38:48,625
- Maybe it'll bring me you.
- I'm coming back.

384
00:38:48,802 --> 00:38:53,342
I promise. No matter what it takes,
I'm coming home.

385
00:38:54,057 --> 00:38:57,676
Just keep it with you. Please.

386
00:38:57,852 --> 00:38:59,935
For me.

387
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:04,644
Okay.

388
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,290
- Neo!
- How the hell...?

389
00:39:26,714 --> 00:39:28,876
Bane.

390
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:30,381
Is something wrong?

391
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:32,258
No, I'm fine.

392
00:39:32,428 --> 00:39:35,216
I just wanted to catch you to say...

393
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:37,221
good luck.

394
00:39:38,892 --> 00:39:40,599
Thanks.

395
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:43,182
We'll see you.

396
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:47,857
Neo! Just in time.

397
00:39:48,027 --> 00:39:50,360
- You're gonna see the Oracle?
- There's no time.

398
00:39:50,529 --> 00:39:52,145
I had to give something to Neo.

399
00:39:52,865 --> 00:39:55,573
A gift from one of the orphans.

400
00:39:55,743 --> 00:39:59,156
He made me swear to get it to you
before you left.

401
00:40:00,038 --> 00:40:02,496
He said you'd understand.

402
00:40:05,168 --> 00:40:07,285
Thanks.

403
00:40:14,385 --> 00:40:17,298
I was just told you cleared
the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> for takeoff.

404
00:40:17,472 --> 00:40:19,429
That is correct.

405
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,556
Am I still in charge
of our defense system?

406
00:40:21,726 --> 00:40:23,012
Of course.

407
00:40:23,728 --> 00:40:27,768
I believe I need every ship we have
if we're going to survive this attack.

408
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:30,520
I understand that, commander.

409
00:40:30,693 --> 00:40:33,276
Then why did you allow
the <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> to leave?

410
00:40:33,446 --> 00:40:38,316
Because I believe our survival depends
on more than how many ships we have.

411
00:40:40,827 --> 00:40:43,114
Be careful.

412
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,358
Hello.

413
00:41:24,662 --> 00:41:28,201
- You seek the Oracle.
- Who are you?

414
00:41:31,252 --> 00:41:35,747
I am Seraph. I can take you to her,
but first I must apologize.

415
00:41:36,006 --> 00:41:37,713
Apologize for what?

416
00:41:38,384 --> 00:41:40,171
For this.

417
00:42:37,484 --> 00:42:39,726
Good.

418
00:42:42,238 --> 00:42:45,402
The Oracle has many enemies.
I had to be sure.

419
00:42:45,575 --> 00:42:47,782
- Of what?
- That you are the One.

420
00:42:48,243 --> 00:42:51,987
- You could have just asked.
- No. You do not truly know someone...

421
00:42:52,164 --> 00:42:54,406
until you fight them.

422
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:58,417
Come. She's waiting.

423
00:43:13,477 --> 00:43:15,343
Where the hell did they go?

424
00:43:15,729 --> 00:43:18,437
These are back doors, aren't they?

425
00:43:18,607 --> 00:43:21,520
Programmer access.

426
00:43:22,611 --> 00:43:26,355
- How do they work?
- A code is hidden in tumblers.

427
00:43:26,532 --> 00:43:31,526
One position opens a lock and another
position opens one of these doors.

428
00:43:33,287 --> 00:43:36,121
Are you a programmer?

429
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,623
Then what are you?

430
00:43:40,795 --> 00:43:44,288
I protect that which matters most.

431
00:44:03,818 --> 00:44:07,186
Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.

432
00:44:07,613 --> 00:44:10,400
Come around here
and let me have a look at you.

433
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:15,985
My goodness, look at you.

434
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:19,163
You turned out all right, didn't you?

435
00:44:19,332 --> 00:44:21,540
- How do you feel?
- I...

436
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:25,294
I know you're not sleeping.
We'll get to that.

437
00:44:25,463 --> 00:44:28,171
Why don't you come
and have a sit this time.

438
00:44:28,883 --> 00:44:33,002
- Maybe I'll stand.
- Well, suit yourself.

439
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:46,687
- I felt like sitting.
- I know.

440
00:44:47,861 --> 00:44:49,773
So...

441
00:44:51,865 --> 00:44:54,277
let's get the obvious stuff
out of the way.

442
00:44:54,575 --> 00:44:59,036
- You're not human, are you?
- It's tough to get more obvious than that.

443
00:44:59,204 --> 00:45:05,041
If I had to guess, I'd say you're
a program from the machine world.

444
00:45:05,419 --> 00:45:09,629
- So is he.
- So far, so good.

445
00:45:09,798 --> 00:45:12,962
But if that's true, that could mean
you're part of this system...

446
00:45:13,135 --> 00:45:15,718
another kind of control.

447
00:45:15,888 --> 00:45:20,383
- Keep going.
- I suppose the most obvious question is...

448
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:24,473
- how can I trust you?
- Bingo.

449
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:28,765
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.
Bad news is...

450
00:45:28,942 --> 00:45:32,606
there's no way you can really know
if I'm here to help you or not.

451
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,318
So it's really up to you. Just have
to make up your own damn mind...

452
00:45:36,491 --> 00:45:41,282
to either accept what
I'm going to tell you or reject it.

453
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,742
Candy?

454
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,498
Do you already
know if I'll take it?

455
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:51,875
Wouldn't be much
of an oracle if I didn't.

456
00:45:52,048 --> 00:45:55,257
But if you already know,
how can I make a choice?

457
00:45:55,426 --> 00:45:59,466
Because you didn't come here to make
the choice. You've already made it.

458
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:04,259
You're here to try to understand
why you made it.

459
00:46:09,816 --> 00:46:12,775
I thought you'd have figured that out
by now.

460
00:46:14,529 --> 00:46:17,112
- Why are you here?
- Same reason.

461
00:46:17,365 --> 00:46:20,107
I love candy.

462
00:46:20,283 --> 00:46:23,117
But why help us?

463
00:46:23,286 --> 00:46:26,779
We're all here to do
what we're all here to do.

464
00:46:27,332 --> 00:46:30,416
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
the future.

465
00:46:30,585 --> 00:46:34,795
And believe me, I know, the only way
to get there is together.

466
00:46:35,632 --> 00:46:40,548
- Are there other programs like you?
- Well, not like me, but...

467
00:46:40,721 --> 00:46:43,384
Look. See those birds?

468
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:47,008
At some point, a program was written
to govern them.

469
00:46:47,185 --> 00:46:53,022
A program was written to watch over the
trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.

470
00:46:53,275 --> 00:46:56,143
There are programs running
all over the place.

471
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:00,779
The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.

472
00:47:00,948 --> 00:47:04,783
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones...

473
00:47:04,952 --> 00:47:09,037
Well, you hear about them all the time.

474
00:47:09,623 --> 00:47:12,491
- I've never heard of them.
- Of course you have.

475
00:47:12,668 --> 00:47:17,584
Every time you've heard someone
say they saw a ghost or an angel...

476
00:47:17,757 --> 00:47:22,343
every story you've ever heard about
vampires, werewolves or aliens...

477
00:47:22,511 --> 00:47:24,844
is the system assimilating
some program...

478
00:47:25,014 --> 00:47:29,679
that's doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.

479
00:47:29,852 --> 00:47:32,845
Programs hacking programs.

480
00:47:33,022 --> 00:47:35,890
- Why?
- They have their reasons...

481
00:47:36,066 --> 00:47:40,026
but usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

482
00:47:40,446 --> 00:47:44,359
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.

483
00:47:44,532 --> 00:47:49,072
Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

484
00:47:49,245 --> 00:47:54,206
And when it does, a program
can either choose to hide here...

485
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:57,038
or return to the source.

486
00:47:58,713 --> 00:48:02,002
- The machine mainframe.
- Yes.

487
00:48:02,175 --> 00:48:04,667
Where you must go.

488
00:48:04,844 --> 00:48:09,054
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it...

489
00:48:10,225 --> 00:48:13,059
in your dreams, haven't you?

490
00:48:13,228 --> 00:48:16,062
A door made of light?

491
00:48:18,316 --> 00:48:21,855
What happens when you go through
the door?

492
00:48:23,988 --> 00:48:26,980
I see Trinity...

493
00:48:27,157 --> 00:48:30,321
and something happens...

494
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:32,406
something bad.

495
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:36,573
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.

496
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:41,495
- Do you see her die?
- No.

497
00:48:42,297 --> 00:48:45,335
You have the sight now, Neo.

498
00:48:45,509 --> 00:48:48,502
You are looking at the world
without time.

499
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:51,092
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?

500
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:55,009
We can never see past the choices
we don't understand.

501
00:48:55,185 --> 00:48:58,349
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?

502
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:02,394
No, you've already made the choice.

503
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:05,106
Now you have to understand it.

504
00:49:05,737 --> 00:49:07,102
No.

505
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,523
I can't do that. I won't.

506
00:49:11,242 --> 00:49:13,609
- Well, you have to.
- Why?

507
00:49:14,203 --> 00:49:17,287
Because you're the One.

508
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:22,451
What if I can't?

509
00:49:22,628 --> 00:49:24,620
What happens if I fail?

510
00:49:25,214 --> 00:49:28,207
Then Zion will fall.

511
00:49:35,683 --> 00:49:40,553
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion...

512
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:44,064
if you reach the source, but to do that
you need the Keymaker.

513
00:49:44,233 --> 00:49:45,269
The Keymaker?

514
00:49:45,443 --> 00:49:49,027
He disappeared. We didn't
know what happened to him until now.

515
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:52,939
He's being held prisoner
by a very dangerous program...

516
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:56,655
one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.

517
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:59,696
- And he won't let him go willingly.
- What does he want?

518
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:04,709
What do all men with power want?
More power.

519
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:08,663
Be there at that exact time...

520
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,503
and you will have a chance.

521
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:14,544
We must go.

522
00:50:14,721 --> 00:50:20,092
Seems like every time we meet
I got nothing but bad news.

523
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:23,553
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.

524
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,473
But for what it's worth...

525
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:31,189
you've made a believer out of me.

526
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:34,605
Good luck, kiddo.

527
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:57,503
Mr. Anderson.

528
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,547
Did you get my package?

529
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,886
- Yeah.
- Well, good.

530
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,929
- Smith?
- He's not reading like an agent.

531
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:10,975
- Surprised to see me?
- No.

532
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,734
- Then you're aware of it.
- Of what?

533
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,938
Our connection.

534
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:19,778
I don't fully understand how it happened.

535
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:23,319
Perhaps some part of you
imprinted onto me...

536
00:51:23,496 --> 00:51:26,159
something overwritten or copied.

537
00:51:26,332 --> 00:51:29,040
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...

538
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:32,294
that whatever happened,
happened for a reason.

539
00:51:32,463 --> 00:51:34,125
And what reason is that?

540
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:38,550
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.

541
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,963
With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.

542
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,633
And then something happened,
something that I knew was impossible...

543
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:47,642
but it happened anyway.

544
00:51:48,354 --> 00:51:51,518
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.

545
00:51:53,526 --> 00:51:58,111
Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood
what I was supposed to do...

546
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,273
but I didn't.

547
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,614
I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...

548
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,618
compelled to disobey.

549
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:13,952
And now, here I stand
because of you, Mr. Anderson.

550
00:52:14,129 --> 00:52:18,089
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent
of this system.

551
00:52:18,258 --> 00:52:21,467
Because of you, I've changed.
I'm unplugged.

552
00:52:21,636 --> 00:52:26,472
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.

553
00:52:26,808 --> 00:52:28,174
Congratulations.

554
00:52:28,935 --> 00:52:31,268
Thank you.

555
00:52:31,855 --> 00:52:36,475
But as you well know,
appearances can be deceiving...

556
00:52:36,651 --> 00:52:41,816
which brings me back to the reason
why we're here.

557
00:52:41,989 --> 00:52:46,859
We're not here because we're free.
We're here because we are not free.

558
00:52:47,036 --> 00:52:50,950
There's no escaping reason,
no denying purpose.

559
00:52:51,123 --> 00:52:54,491
Because as we both know,
without purpose...

560
00:52:54,668 --> 00:52:59,504
- we would not exist.
- It is purpose that created us.

561
00:52:59,673 --> 00:53:02,666
- Purpose that connects us.
- Purpose that pulls us.

562
00:53:02,843 --> 00:53:04,763
- That guides us.
- That drives us.

563
00:53:04,845 --> 00:53:09,556
- It is purpose that defines.
- Purpose that binds us.

564
00:53:09,725 --> 00:53:12,183
We are here because of you,
Mr. Anderson.

565
00:53:12,353 --> 00:53:16,723
We're here to take from you
what you tried to take from us:

566
00:53:18,692 --> 00:53:20,775
Purpose.

567
00:53:23,863 --> 00:53:25,729
- What's happening to him?
- Don't know.

568
00:53:28,785 --> 00:53:32,369
Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.

569
00:55:19,227 --> 00:55:21,685
- You.
- Yes, me.

570
00:55:25,858 --> 00:55:28,725
Me, me, me.

571
00:55:33,615 --> 00:55:35,277
Me too.

572
00:57:43,033 --> 00:57:44,069
More.

573
00:58:46,345 --> 00:58:49,179
It is inevitable.

574
00:58:49,598 --> 00:58:51,009
Come on, get out of there.

575
00:59:34,225 --> 00:59:36,558
Are you all right?

576
00:59:37,645 --> 00:59:39,557
- It was Smith.
- Yes.

577
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,056
- Now there's more than one?
- A lot more.

578
00:59:43,233 --> 00:59:47,022
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

579
00:59:47,196 --> 00:59:49,654
Somehow, he's found a way
to copy himself.

580
00:59:49,823 --> 00:59:54,033
- Is that what he was doing to you?
- I don't know what he was doing...

581
00:59:54,203 --> 00:59:56,946
- but I know what it felt like.
- What?

582
00:59:57,873 --> 01:00:01,583
It felt like I was back in that hallway.

583
01:00:01,752 --> 01:00:03,163
It felt like dying.

584
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:06,538
The machines are tunneling to avoid
our defense system.

585
01:00:06,715 --> 01:00:10,550
But I believe they will intersect
certain pipelines to control them.

586
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:13,257
These points of intersection
are crucial...

587
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:16,218
because I believe they're
vulnerable to counterattack.

588
01:00:16,391 --> 01:00:20,431
Although it has been suggested that
this is the same kind of attack...

589
01:00:20,604 --> 01:00:24,267
we've defended for years,
I urge the Council to realize the truth.

590
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,774
This is the single greatest threat
we have ever faced...

591
01:00:27,944 --> 01:00:31,779
and if we do not act accordingly,
we will not survive.

592
01:00:31,948 --> 01:00:35,942
Commander Lock, the Council is well
aware of the seriousness of this attack.

593
01:00:36,244 --> 01:00:40,784
You have our leave to prepare our defense
by any and all means necessary.

594
01:00:40,957 --> 01:00:43,620
- Thank you, Council.
- However...

595
01:00:43,876 --> 01:00:47,210
we ask if there's been word
from the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

596
01:00:47,463 --> 01:00:49,955
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.

597
01:00:51,592 --> 01:00:55,552
Then we request a ship be dispatched
to ascertain the fate of the One.

598
01:00:55,721 --> 01:00:59,465
I wish that were possible, councillor,
but I do not believe our defense...

599
01:00:59,642 --> 01:01:03,181
- can suffer the loss of another ship.
- It will, commander, if it must.

600
01:01:03,354 --> 01:01:05,687
It could take one ship days
to find the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

601
01:01:05,856 --> 01:01:08,893
- Then send two.
- This is insane.

602
01:01:09,067 --> 01:01:12,060
Careful, commander.

603
01:01:12,279 --> 01:01:15,613
Forgive my frustration, councillors.

604
01:01:15,782 --> 01:01:19,651
But I wish I were able to comprehend
the Council's choice in this matter.

605
01:01:19,828 --> 01:01:22,992
Comprehension is not
a requisite of cooperation.

606
01:01:23,164 --> 01:01:25,622
If you are asking me
to order two of my captains...

607
01:01:25,792 --> 01:01:27,499
There's no need for such an order.

608
01:01:27,669 --> 01:01:31,208
The captains are present.
They can answer for themselves.

609
01:01:31,673 --> 01:01:36,919
The Council is calling for two volunteers
to aid the <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>

610
01:01:37,095 --> 01:01:41,260
Are there two among you
that would answer such a call?

611
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,348
Captain Soren of the <i>Vigilant</i>
will answer the Council's call.

612
01:01:46,521 --> 01:01:49,433
You understand the situation,
Captain Soren?

613
01:01:49,607 --> 01:01:52,065
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, captain.

614
01:01:53,485 --> 01:01:54,896
Is there another?

615
01:01:55,696 --> 01:01:59,406
- Captain, I think we should volunteer.
- What? You have gone crazy.

616
01:01:59,575 --> 01:02:01,441
- Listen...
- Shut your hole, Bane...

617
01:02:01,619 --> 01:02:03,110
before I put you in one.

618
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,704
Is there no other?

619
01:02:15,466 --> 01:02:17,378
Be hard for any man to risk his life...

620
01:02:17,551 --> 01:02:20,510
especially if he doesn't
understand the reason.

621
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:24,464
Captain Niobe of the <i>Logos</i>
will answer the councillor's call.

622
01:02:24,642 --> 01:02:26,884
- What?
- Thank you, Captain Niobe.

623
01:02:27,102 --> 01:02:32,187
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.

624
01:02:36,903 --> 01:02:39,486
- Niobe, what are you doing?
- What I can.

625
01:02:39,656 --> 01:02:40,692
Why?

626
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:45,234
Because some things
never change, Jason...

627
01:02:45,411 --> 01:02:47,744
and some things do.

628
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,591
What can you see, Neo?

629
01:03:05,765 --> 01:03:08,098
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.

630
01:03:08,267 --> 01:03:09,849
- Encrypted?
- Maybe.

631
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:11,976
Is that good for us or bad for us?

632
01:03:12,689 --> 01:03:15,806
Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.

633
01:03:16,441 --> 01:03:17,977
Bad for us.

634
01:03:18,402 --> 01:03:19,893
Here we go.

635
01:03:27,911 --> 01:03:30,824
Yes. We are here to speak
with the Merovingian.

636
01:03:31,289 --> 01:03:35,124
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.

637
01:03:35,293 --> 01:03:36,329
Follow me.

638
01:03:57,022 --> 01:04:00,686
A-ha. Here he is at last.

639
01:04:00,901 --> 01:04:04,190
Neo, the One himself.

640
01:04:04,363 --> 01:04:05,774
Right?

641
01:04:05,948 --> 01:04:08,281
And the legendary Morpheus.

642
01:04:09,118 --> 01:04:13,988
And Trinity, of course.
I have heard so much.

643
01:04:14,165 --> 01:04:17,624
You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.
This is my wife, Persephone.

644
01:04:18,544 --> 01:04:21,833
Something to eat? Drink?

645
01:04:22,131 --> 01:04:25,169
Of course, such things are contrivances,
like so much here.

646
01:04:25,342 --> 01:04:27,834
For the sake of appearances.

647
01:04:28,012 --> 01:04:31,471
- No, thank you.
- Yes, of course. Who has time?

648
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:36,726
Who has time? But then, if we do not ever
take time, how can we ever have time?

649
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,808
Château Haut-Briond, 1959.
Magnificent wine.

650
01:04:43,985 --> 01:04:46,898
I love French wine
like I love the French language.

651
01:04:47,071 --> 01:04:51,236
I have sampled every language. French
is my favorite. Fantastic language...

652
01:04:51,409 --> 01:04:53,526
especially to curse with.

653
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:02,080
You see? It's like wiping your ass
with silk. I love it.

654
01:05:03,713 --> 01:05:05,454
You know why we are here.

655
01:05:07,217 --> 01:05:12,087
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.

656
01:05:12,514 --> 01:05:18,351
The question is,
do you know why you are here?

657
01:05:18,645 --> 01:05:21,102
We are looking for the Keymaker.

658
01:05:21,772 --> 01:05:26,267
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.

659
01:05:26,443 --> 01:05:29,402
But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

660
01:05:29,571 --> 01:05:33,315
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.

661
01:05:33,492 --> 01:05:39,238
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

662
01:05:39,414 --> 01:05:42,578
- what?
- You know the answer to that question.

663
01:05:42,751 --> 01:05:44,868
But do you?

664
01:05:45,087 --> 01:05:47,420
You think you do, but you do not.

665
01:05:47,589 --> 01:05:50,798
You are here
because you were sent here.

666
01:05:50,968 --> 01:05:54,086
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

667
01:05:55,264 --> 01:05:57,597
It is, of course, the way of all things.

668
01:05:57,766 --> 01:06:00,429
You see, there is only one constant...

669
01:06:00,602 --> 01:06:04,766
one universal. It
is the only real truth.

670
01:06:04,939 --> 01:06:06,601
Causality.

671
01:06:06,774 --> 01:06:09,061
Action, reaction.

672
01:06:09,235 --> 01:06:13,445
- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

673
01:06:13,614 --> 01:06:15,355
No. Wrong.

674
01:06:15,533 --> 01:06:20,119
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power...

675
01:06:20,288 --> 01:06:22,371
and those without.

676
01:06:23,916 --> 01:06:27,080
Look there at that woman.

677
01:06:27,795 --> 01:06:31,709
My God, just look at her...

678
01:06:31,966 --> 01:06:34,629
affecting everyone around her.

679
01:06:34,802 --> 01:06:39,547
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
But wait.

680
01:06:39,807 --> 01:06:43,551
Watch. You see, I have sent her
a dessert...

681
01:06:43,769 --> 01:06:47,978
a very special dessert.

682
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:54,777
I wrote it myself.

683
01:06:54,946 --> 01:06:58,155
It starts so simply...

684
01:06:58,325 --> 01:07:02,911
each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like...

685
01:07:03,955 --> 01:07:05,571
poetry.

686
01:07:05,749 --> 01:07:07,160
First...

687
01:07:07,667 --> 01:07:13,083
a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.

688
01:07:13,673 --> 01:07:16,290
You can see it, Neo, yes?

689
01:07:16,927 --> 01:07:19,510
She does not understand why.

690
01:07:19,763 --> 01:07:22,176
Is it the wine? No.

691
01:07:22,349 --> 01:07:24,716
What is it then? What is the reason?

692
01:07:25,352 --> 01:07:27,684
And soon it does not matter.

693
01:07:27,853 --> 01:07:30,846
Soon the why and the reason are gone...

694
01:07:31,815 --> 01:07:37,356
and all that matters
is the feeling itself.

695
01:07:37,821 --> 01:07:40,905
And this is the nature of the universe.

696
01:07:41,075 --> 01:07:43,613
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

697
01:07:43,786 --> 01:07:46,369
but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

698
01:07:46,538 --> 01:07:50,532
Beneath our poised appearance...

699
01:07:50,709 --> 01:07:56,000
the truth is, we are completely...

700
01:07:58,884 --> 01:08:01,752
out of control.

701
01:08:07,101 --> 01:08:11,970
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

702
01:08:12,397 --> 01:08:17,859
Our only hope, our only peace,
is to understand it, to understand the why.

703
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:21,441
"Why" is what separates us from them...

704
01:08:21,614 --> 01:08:23,901
you from me.

705
01:08:24,075 --> 01:08:27,819
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.

706
01:08:27,996 --> 01:08:31,285
And this is how you come to me,
without why, without power.

707
01:08:31,457 --> 01:08:34,245
Another link in the chain.

708
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:35,746
But fear not.

709
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,789
Since I have seen how good you are
at following orders...

710
01:08:39,966 --> 01:08:42,583
I will tell you what to do next.

711
01:08:43,094 --> 01:08:47,930
Run back and give the fortuneteller
this message:

712
01:08:48,141 --> 01:08:52,384
Her time is almost up.

713
01:08:53,437 --> 01:08:56,976
Now I have some real business to do,
so I will say <i>adieu</i> and goodbye.

714
01:08:57,149 --> 01:08:59,641
- This isn't over.
- Oh, yes, it is.

715
01:08:59,818 --> 01:09:06,190
The Keymaker is mine, and I see no reason
why I should give him up.

716
01:09:06,366 --> 01:09:10,406
- No reason at all.
- Where are you going?

717
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:15,290
Please, <i>ma chérie</i>, I have told you.
We are all victims of causality.

718
01:09:15,459 --> 01:09:18,793
I drank too much wine,
I must take a piss.

719
01:09:19,296 --> 01:09:22,414
Cause and effect. <i>Au revoir.</i>

720
01:09:27,471 --> 01:09:30,555
Touch me and that hand
will never touch anything again.

721
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,931
Well, that didn't go so well.

722
01:09:41,108 --> 01:09:43,475
Are you certain the Oracle
didn't say anything else?

723
01:09:43,652 --> 01:09:45,769
- Yes.
- Maybe we did something wrong.

724
01:09:46,447 --> 01:09:47,779
Or didn't do something.

725
01:09:47,948 --> 01:09:51,191
No, what happened couldn't have
happened any other way.

726
01:09:51,368 --> 01:09:54,111
- How do you know?
- We are still alive.

727
01:09:57,416 --> 01:10:00,659
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.

728
01:10:07,676 --> 01:10:09,759
Get out.

729
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:18,017
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
On and on. Pompous prick.

730
01:10:18,603 --> 01:10:24,099
A long time ago, when we first came here,
it was so different.

731
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,568
He was so different.

732
01:10:30,365 --> 01:10:32,982
He was like you.

733
01:10:35,703 --> 01:10:39,492
I'll give you what you want,
but you have to give me something.

734
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:42,537
- What?
- A kiss.

735
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:44,035
Excuse me?

736
01:10:45,547 --> 01:10:49,461
I want you to kiss me
as if you were kissing her.

737
01:10:51,386 --> 01:10:54,970
- Why?
- You love her. She loves you.

738
01:10:55,223 --> 01:10:57,180
It's all over you both.

739
01:10:57,851 --> 01:11:02,390
A long time ago,
I knew what that felt like.

740
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:09,476
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it. That's all.

741
01:11:09,736 --> 01:11:11,568
Just a sample.

742
01:11:11,738 --> 01:11:14,731
- Why don't you sample this instead?
- Trinity.

743
01:11:16,952 --> 01:11:21,913
Such emotion over something so small.
It's just a kiss.

744
01:11:22,082 --> 01:11:24,244
Why should we trust you?

745
01:11:24,418 --> 01:11:28,412
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,
she can kill me.

746
01:11:35,512 --> 01:11:37,629
All right.

747
01:11:37,931 --> 01:11:41,765
But you have to make me believe
I am her.

748
01:11:42,977 --> 01:11:45,014
All right.

749
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,192
Terrible. Forget it.

750
01:11:56,157 --> 01:11:57,614
Wait.

751
01:11:58,534 --> 01:12:00,070
Okay.

752
01:12:37,155 --> 01:12:39,238
Yes.

753
01:12:39,824 --> 01:12:42,316
That's it.

754
01:12:57,092 --> 01:13:02,508
I envy you. But such a thing
is not meant to last.

755
01:13:05,517 --> 01:13:06,882
Come with me.

756
01:13:37,965 --> 01:13:39,706
Not again.

757
01:13:43,137 --> 01:13:45,754
It's all right, boys. They're with me.

758
01:13:46,432 --> 01:13:48,798
These fellas work for my husband.

759
01:13:48,975 --> 01:13:52,810
They do his dirty work.
They're very good, very loyal.

760
01:13:52,979 --> 01:13:54,515
Aren't you, boys?

761
01:13:54,689 --> 01:13:55,725
Yes, mistress.

762
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:58,606
They come from a much older version
of the Matrix.

763
01:13:58,776 --> 01:14:02,941
But like so many back then, they caused
more problems than they solved.

764
01:14:03,698 --> 01:14:08,693
My husband saved them because
they're notoriously difficult to terminate.

765
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:12,910
How many people keep silver bullets
in their gun?

766
01:14:17,628 --> 01:14:20,837
You can either run and tell my husband
what I have done...

767
01:14:21,007 --> 01:14:23,590
or you can stay there and die.

768
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:26,467
He's in the ladies' room!

769
01:14:32,559 --> 01:14:34,471
Hurry.

770
01:15:00,045 --> 01:15:03,209
- My name is Neo.
- Yes. I'm the Keymaker.

771
01:15:03,382 --> 01:15:05,294
I've been waiting for you.

772
01:15:11,223 --> 01:15:15,808
Oh! My God! My God, Persephone,
how could you do this? You betray me.

773
01:15:20,147 --> 01:15:22,981
- Cause and effect, my love.
- Cause?

774
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:26,143
There is no cause for this. What cause?

775
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:30,610
What cause? How about the lipstick
you're still wearing?

776
01:15:30,783 --> 01:15:33,491
Lipstick? Lipstick.

777
01:15:33,661 --> 01:15:37,496
What craziness are you talking about,
woman? There is no lipstick!

778
01:15:39,208 --> 01:15:41,871
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.

779
01:15:43,003 --> 01:15:47,464
Aye-yi-yi-yi.
Woman, this is nothing.

780
01:15:47,633 --> 01:15:53,174
- It is a game. It is only a game.
- So is this.

781
01:15:53,347 --> 01:15:55,339
Have fun.

782
01:16:01,855 --> 01:16:03,517
All right.

783
01:16:03,690 --> 01:16:05,431
All right.

784
01:16:05,692 --> 01:16:08,480
Let us find out where this goes.

785
01:16:08,653 --> 01:16:11,521
You two, get the Keymaker.

786
01:16:18,037 --> 01:16:20,029
That's a nice trick.

787
01:16:20,206 --> 01:16:21,492
I cannot go back.

788
01:16:22,041 --> 01:16:24,033
I'll handle them.

789
01:16:24,544 --> 01:16:30,666
Handle us? You'll handle us? You know,
your predecessors had much more respect.

790
01:16:44,062 --> 01:16:46,099
Okay, you have some skill.

791
01:16:48,317 --> 01:16:50,274
Kill him.

792
01:17:50,461 --> 01:17:52,498
You see? He's just a man.

793
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:10,045
Goddamn it, woman,
you will be the end of me.

794
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:16,176
Mark my words, boy,
and mark them well.

795
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:21,565
I have survived your predecessors,
and I will survive you.

796
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:44,996
- Where are you going?
- Another way. Always another way.

797
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:51,002
Close it, quick!

798
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:58,346
Could we move along?

799
01:21:01,897 --> 01:21:03,479
Run!

800
01:21:19,415 --> 01:21:21,748
Step away from the door.

801
01:21:26,839 --> 01:21:28,125
We owe you for that.

802
01:21:30,384 --> 01:21:31,545
Just like new.

803
01:21:31,844 --> 01:21:33,301
Drop your weapon.

804
01:21:38,683 --> 01:21:40,515
- Stay with him.
- What about Neo?

805
01:21:40,685 --> 01:21:42,221
He can handle himself.

806
01:21:45,315 --> 01:21:46,396
Get in back.

807
01:22:24,061 --> 01:22:25,222
Shit.

808
01:22:25,729 --> 01:22:27,220
- Operator.
<i>- Link, where am I?</i>

809
01:22:27,773 --> 01:22:30,982
You won't believe this,
but you're way up in the mountains.

810
01:22:31,276 --> 01:22:33,563
- Really?
<i>- It'll take me a while to get an exit.</i>

811
01:22:34,071 --> 01:22:35,107
- Shit!
<i>- What?</i>

812
01:22:35,322 --> 01:22:38,002
The twins are after Morpheus and Trinity.
They don't have a way out.

813
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:41,526
- Where are they?
<i>- Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.</i>

814
01:22:58,303 --> 01:22:59,884
<i>- Operator.</i>
- Get us out of here.

815
01:23:00,054 --> 01:23:02,797
<i>- Won't be easy.</i>
- I know. We're inside the core network.

816
01:23:02,974 --> 01:23:05,591
<i>The only exit I got
near you is the Winslow overpass.</i>

817
01:23:05,768 --> 01:23:07,851
- Off the freeway.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

818
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:09,220
Fine, we'll make it.

819
01:23:09,232 --> 01:23:11,764
<i>I should... Oh, shit!
Look out behind you!</i>

820
01:23:16,779 --> 01:23:18,361
- Incoming fire.
- Down!

821
01:23:26,622 --> 01:23:27,783
Hold on!

822
01:23:44,806 --> 01:23:47,298
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly
real fast.

823
01:23:47,475 --> 01:23:49,182
Are you watching this, Link?

824
01:23:49,352 --> 01:23:52,971
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you.
Eight units headed your way.

825
01:23:54,024 --> 01:23:55,981
Any suggestions?

826
01:23:57,861 --> 01:23:59,853
- Turn right.
- Right, now.

827
01:24:07,329 --> 01:24:10,163
Straight here.
You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.

828
01:24:10,332 --> 01:24:13,040
<i>- Got it.</i>
- You sure about this? The freeway, I mean.

829
01:24:13,209 --> 01:24:15,491
In 14 years of
operating, I've never seen...

830
01:24:15,503 --> 01:24:16,919
Link, what did I tell you?

831
01:24:17,213 --> 01:24:19,500
Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.

832
01:24:19,674 --> 01:24:22,166
- I'll be ready for you.
- Good man.

833
01:24:22,344 --> 01:24:24,505
You always told me
to stay off the freeway.

834
01:24:24,678 --> 01:24:27,295
- Yes, that's true.
- You said it was suicide.

835
01:24:27,514 --> 01:24:29,426
Then let us hope...

836
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,966
that I was wrong.

837
01:24:42,863 --> 01:24:44,063
- Operator.
- Link, it's Niobe.

838
01:24:44,114 --> 01:24:45,730
We've been sent to bring you in.

839
01:24:45,908 --> 01:24:48,992
- I need to talk to Morpheus.
- Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.

840
01:24:49,161 --> 01:24:51,153
<i>- Where is he?</i>
- Just follow the sirens.

841
01:24:58,712 --> 01:25:00,624
Repeat, they're approaching the...

842
01:25:03,801 --> 01:25:08,010
- We have them now.
- The exile is the primary target.

843
01:26:11,158 --> 01:26:12,615
<i>Shots fired.</i>

844
01:26:15,245 --> 01:26:17,111
Move!

845
01:28:07,104 --> 01:28:10,313
- We are getting aggravated.
- Yes, we are.

846
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:58,352
Trinity.

847
01:28:58,779 --> 01:28:59,895
Get him out of here.

848
01:29:03,534 --> 01:29:05,617
Come on!

849
01:29:22,636 --> 01:29:24,127
Crush him.

850
01:29:54,626 --> 01:29:55,662
Morpheus.

851
01:29:55,835 --> 01:29:57,326
He's okay. Keep moving.

852
01:29:58,338 --> 01:30:00,125
Let's go.

853
01:30:05,886 --> 01:30:08,048
I need a download
to hot-wire a motorcycle.

854
01:30:08,222 --> 01:30:10,555
No problem.
One crash course on motorcycle...

855
01:30:10,724 --> 01:30:12,135
Wait.

856
01:30:13,519 --> 01:30:14,976
Cancel that.

857
01:30:15,145 --> 01:30:17,353
You are handy.

858
01:30:17,523 --> 01:30:19,435
Jump on.

859
01:32:46,710 --> 01:32:47,746
She means nothing.

860
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:51,038
- Find the exile.
- We have them.

861
01:32:51,382 --> 01:32:53,498
<i>One-Adam-12, please respond.</i>

862
01:32:59,973 --> 01:33:01,680
Get down.

863
01:35:12,686 --> 01:35:14,302
Gotcha.

864
01:35:15,063 --> 01:35:16,144
She's good.

865
01:35:20,527 --> 01:35:22,814
You are no longer necessary.

866
01:35:29,494 --> 01:35:33,204
We do only what we're meant to do.

867
01:35:34,833 --> 01:35:38,417
Deletion.

868
01:35:39,379 --> 01:35:41,245
Go kick his ass.

869
01:36:31,304 --> 01:36:34,047
Neo, if you're out there,
I could use some help.

870
01:36:34,807 --> 01:36:36,264
What is that?

871
01:37:06,129 --> 01:37:08,997
Yes! Yes!

872
01:37:15,597 --> 01:37:18,116
We have confirmation
from the <i>Icarus</i>. First

873
01:37:18,128 --> 01:37:20,717
two ships are in
position for counterattack.

874
01:37:20,977 --> 01:37:22,013
Good.

875
01:37:23,021 --> 01:37:24,057
Any change?

876
01:37:24,231 --> 01:37:26,974
They hit some iron ore here.
Slowed them down a little.

877
01:37:27,150 --> 01:37:30,268
- How much?
- An hour, maybe.

878
01:37:30,445 --> 01:37:32,983
That would give them
a little over nine hours.

879
01:37:33,824 --> 01:37:35,440
Yes, sir.

880
01:38:08,065 --> 01:38:10,307
<i>There is a building.</i>

881
01:38:10,484 --> 01:38:16,151
Inside this building, there is a level
where no elevator can go...

882
01:38:16,323 --> 01:38:18,235
and no stair can reach.

883
01:38:18,909 --> 01:38:24,997
<i>This level is filled with doors.
These doors lead to many places.</i>

884
01:38:25,166 --> 01:38:27,499
Hidden places.

885
01:38:27,835 --> 01:38:31,453
But one door is special.

886
01:38:31,629 --> 01:38:33,837
One door leads to the source.

887
01:38:42,182 --> 01:38:46,597
This building is protected
by a very secure system.

888
01:38:46,770 --> 01:38:51,265
- Every alarm triggers the bomb.
- Bomb? Did he say bomb?

889
01:38:51,524 --> 01:38:54,187
But like all systems,
it has a weakness.

890
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:57,353
The system is based on the rules
of a building.

891
01:38:57,530 --> 01:39:00,898
- One system built on another.
- Electricity.

892
01:39:01,451 --> 01:39:06,196
- If one fails, so must the other.
- No electricity, no alarms.

893
01:39:06,372 --> 01:39:09,206
You'd have to take out a city block
to kill the power.

894
01:39:09,375 --> 01:39:13,084
- Not one, 27.
- Twenty-seven blocks?

895
01:39:13,921 --> 01:39:16,379
<i>There is a power station.</i>

896
01:39:16,548 --> 01:39:18,790
<i>It must be destroyed.</i>

897
01:39:18,967 --> 01:39:23,302
- There must be some kind of fail-safe.
- Yes, there is an emergency system.

898
01:39:24,932 --> 01:39:28,721
<i>The core network of the grid
must be accessed.</i>

899
01:39:28,894 --> 01:39:31,728
<i>The emergency system
must be deactivated.</i>

900
01:39:31,897 --> 01:39:33,308
<i>What do you need us for?</i>

901
01:39:33,482 --> 01:39:35,644
Neo could take them out
easier than we could.

902
01:39:35,818 --> 01:39:37,559
- There's no time.
- Why?

903
01:39:37,736 --> 01:39:40,854
Once the door is unprotected,
the connection will be severed.

904
01:39:41,031 --> 01:39:43,318
But another connection
must first be made.

905
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:47,994
<i>- How long will that take?
- Exactly 314 seconds.</i>

906
01:39:48,163 --> 01:39:49,745
<i>Just over five minutes.</i>

907
01:39:49,915 --> 01:39:52,157
<i>That is the length
and breadth of the window.</i>

908
01:39:52,334 --> 01:39:54,621
Only the One can open the door...

909
01:39:54,837 --> 01:39:57,749
and only during that window
can the door be opened.

910
01:39:59,006 --> 01:40:00,588
How do you know all this?

911
01:40:00,758 --> 01:40:05,924
I know because I must know.
It is my purpose.

912
01:40:06,097 --> 01:40:11,593
It's the reason I'm here,
the same reason we're all here.

913
01:40:22,363 --> 01:40:25,151
Neo, I know something's wrong.

914
01:40:25,825 --> 01:40:27,862
You don't have to tell me.

915
01:40:28,035 --> 01:40:31,779
I just want you to know that I'm here.

916
01:40:35,334 --> 01:40:36,791
All must be done as one.

917
01:40:41,548 --> 01:40:43,210
Can't hurt.

918
01:40:46,761 --> 01:40:48,844
If one fails...

919
01:40:49,639 --> 01:40:51,346
<i>all fail.</i>

920
01:40:51,850 --> 01:40:55,514
At midnight, there is a shift change
in the security of both buildings.

921
01:40:56,897 --> 01:41:00,140
<i>At midnight, we will strike.</i>

922
01:41:00,775 --> 01:41:01,856
Hey!

923
01:41:02,027 --> 01:41:05,987
- You count sheep at home.
- Why? I get paid to count them here.

924
01:41:16,166 --> 01:41:18,374
Okay, they're inside.

925
01:41:18,543 --> 01:41:21,034
- How much time?
- Twelve minutes.

926
01:41:23,756 --> 01:41:24,837
Oh, shit.

927
01:41:28,218 --> 01:41:33,680
All of our lives, we have fought this war.
Tonight, I believe we can end it.

928
01:41:35,184 --> 01:41:37,346
<i>Tonight is not an accident.</i>

929
01:41:38,687 --> 01:41:40,679
<i>There are no accidents.</i>

930
01:41:42,066 --> 01:41:47,107
We have not come here by chance.
I do not believe in chance.

931
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:52,866
When I see three objectives,
three captains, three ships...

932
01:41:53,035 --> 01:41:56,528
I do not see coincidence.
I see providence.

933
01:41:56,872 --> 01:41:59,205
<i>I see purpose.</i>

934
01:42:01,919 --> 01:42:08,256
I believe it is our fate to be here.
It is our destiny.

935
01:42:08,424 --> 01:42:13,419
I believe this night holds
for each and every one of us...

936
01:42:13,596 --> 01:42:16,930
the very meaning of our lives.

937
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:21,265
I want to ask you to do something,
but I don't know how.

938
01:42:21,854 --> 01:42:23,766
I promise you, if I can, I will.

939
01:42:25,108 --> 01:42:28,442
What if I asked you to stay out of this...

940
01:42:29,404 --> 01:42:31,396
no matter what...

941
01:42:31,572 --> 01:42:33,905
to stay out of the Matrix?

942
01:42:34,993 --> 01:42:36,780
Why?

943
01:42:45,002 --> 01:42:46,083
Please.

944
01:42:48,171 --> 01:42:49,503
All right.

945
01:42:52,843 --> 01:42:55,335
What is it, Niobe?

946
01:42:55,512 --> 01:42:59,631
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't
help thinking, what if you're wrong?

947
01:42:59,808 --> 01:43:03,097
What if all this, the prophecy,
everything, is bullshit?

948
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:07,264
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

949
01:43:07,691 --> 01:43:10,308
But how would that be different
from any other day?

950
01:43:19,786 --> 01:43:26,283
This is a war, and we are soldiers.

951
01:43:26,543 --> 01:43:29,455
<i>Death can come for us at any time...</i>

952
01:43:30,004 --> 01:43:31,791
<i>in any place.</i>

953
01:43:31,964 --> 01:43:33,876
Incoming. Incoming!

954
01:43:35,843 --> 01:43:37,459
Incoming!

955
01:43:43,392 --> 01:43:45,850
Now consider the alternative.

956
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:50,606
What if I am right?
What if the prophecy is true?

957
01:43:50,775 --> 01:43:55,190
What if tomorrow the war could be over?

958
01:43:56,155 --> 01:43:59,148
Isn't that worth fighting for?

959
01:44:00,284 --> 01:44:02,901
Isn't that worth dying for?

960
01:44:03,829 --> 01:44:06,446
- Time?
- Three minutes.

961
01:44:06,624 --> 01:44:07,740
Almost there.

962
01:44:27,811 --> 01:44:29,177
It is done.

963
01:44:29,354 --> 01:44:30,640
Find the others.

964
01:44:31,773 --> 01:44:34,015
I got Niobe there.
They're out of the station.

965
01:44:34,192 --> 01:44:36,855
- What about Soren?
- There.

966
01:44:37,028 --> 01:44:38,860
They're still inside, but...

967
01:44:39,739 --> 01:44:40,775
They're not moving.

968
01:45:04,930 --> 01:45:06,842
That's it, let's go.

969
01:45:08,976 --> 01:45:10,808
Call Neo now.

970
01:45:14,773 --> 01:45:17,607
- I lost them. They're inside the portal.
- What about the grid?

971
01:45:21,738 --> 01:45:25,231
Everything is operational.
The emergency system is rerouting power.

972
01:45:30,914 --> 01:45:33,076
Jesus.

973
01:45:33,250 --> 01:45:37,289
Soon as they open that door,
it's all over.

974
01:45:37,461 --> 01:45:39,418
The hell it is.

975
01:45:40,173 --> 01:45:41,505
What are you...? Trinity!

976
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:45,759
I will not wait and do nothing.
I will not watch them die.

977
01:45:45,928 --> 01:45:48,090
We're talking less than five minutes.

978
01:45:48,264 --> 01:45:50,756
In five minutes,
I'll tear that building down.

979
01:45:50,933 --> 01:45:54,472
- How much further?
- Here, just here.

980
01:45:55,771 --> 01:45:59,765
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.

981
01:46:00,943 --> 01:46:03,435
It's gotta be the ugliest hack
I have ever done.

982
01:46:06,657 --> 01:46:09,775
That's as close as I can get you.
You better grow wings.

983
01:46:28,386 --> 01:46:29,466
- Operator.
<i>- I'm in.</i>

984
01:46:29,596 --> 01:46:31,758
Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.

985
01:46:32,349 --> 01:46:36,514
You look surprised to see me again,
Mr. Anderson.

986
01:46:36,686 --> 01:46:42,057
Well, that's the difference between us.
I have been expecting you.

987
01:46:42,234 --> 01:46:45,147
- What do you want, Smith?
- You haven't figured that out?

988
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:50,816
Still using all the muscles
except the one that matters.

989
01:46:50,992 --> 01:46:53,655
I want exactly what you want.

990
01:46:53,828 --> 01:46:55,911
I want everything.

991
01:46:56,373 --> 01:46:58,864
Would that include a bullet
from this gun?

992
01:46:59,041 --> 01:47:00,828
Go ahead, shoot.

993
01:47:01,001 --> 01:47:06,292
The best thing about being me,
there's so many me's.

994
01:47:17,685 --> 01:47:21,304
Christ! What the hell happened in here?

995
01:47:22,189 --> 01:47:24,226
Hold it right there, little lady.

996
01:47:33,575 --> 01:47:35,362
If you can't beat us...

997
01:47:35,536 --> 01:47:37,368
Join us.

998
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:40,621
Morpheus!

999
01:47:54,220 --> 01:47:57,338
Still no sight of them.
They only got two minutes left.

1000
01:48:11,112 --> 01:48:12,148
One minute.

1001
01:48:21,372 --> 01:48:22,408
Come on.

1002
01:48:23,582 --> 01:48:25,494
Come on.

1003
01:48:26,084 --> 01:48:27,950
Please.

1004
01:48:37,888 --> 01:48:39,424
Kill them.

1005
01:48:47,314 --> 01:48:48,350
They're in.

1006
01:48:48,523 --> 01:48:50,480
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

1007
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:08,157
It was meant to be.

1008
01:49:08,334 --> 01:49:13,705
Morpheus, that door will take you home.

1009
01:49:22,473 --> 01:49:26,808
You will know which door.
Hurry, Neo.

1010
01:49:32,316 --> 01:49:35,480
Trinity, I got some serious activity
headed your way.

1011
01:50:27,787 --> 01:50:29,153
Hello, Neo.

1012
01:50:29,706 --> 01:50:33,494
- Who are you?
- I am the Architect.

1013
01:50:33,667 --> 01:50:37,286
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.

1014
01:50:37,546 --> 01:50:41,711
You have many questions. Though the
process has altered your consciousness...

1015
01:50:41,884 --> 01:50:43,876
you remain irrevocably human.

1016
01:50:44,052 --> 01:50:47,636
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some you will not.

1017
01:50:48,056 --> 01:50:52,096
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent...

1018
01:50:52,269 --> 01:50:55,979
you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.

1019
01:50:56,857 --> 01:50:58,473
Why am I here?

1020
01:50:58,650 --> 01:51:02,564
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation...

1021
01:51:02,738 --> 01:51:05,071
inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

1022
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:09,325
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts...

1023
01:51:09,495 --> 01:51:12,329
I've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise...

1024
01:51:12,498 --> 01:51:16,958
a harmony of mathematical precision.

1025
01:51:17,293 --> 01:51:19,626
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided...

1026
01:51:19,795 --> 01:51:24,256
it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control...

1027
01:51:24,425 --> 01:51:28,385
which has led you, inexorably...

1028
01:51:29,347 --> 01:51:30,588
here.

1029
01:51:30,765 --> 01:51:34,850
- You haven't answered my question.
- Quite right.

1030
01:51:35,019 --> 01:51:38,808
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.

1031
01:51:38,981 --> 01:51:41,598
<i>Others? How many?
What others?</i>

1032
01:51:41,776 --> 01:51:44,268
The Matrix is older than you know.

1033
01:51:44,445 --> 01:51:48,439
I count from the emergence of one integral
anomaly to the emergence of the next.

1034
01:51:48,616 --> 01:51:50,858
In which case, this is the sixth version.

1035
01:51:51,035 --> 01:51:53,493
<i>Five before me?
He's lying. Bullshit.</i>

1036
01:51:53,663 --> 01:51:57,201
<i>There are only two possible explanations.
There were five before me.</i>

1037
01:51:57,374 --> 01:51:58,660
<i>Either no one told me...</i>

1038
01:51:59,918 --> 01:52:03,912
- or no one knows.
- Precisely.

1039
01:52:04,089 --> 01:52:07,378
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic...

1040
01:52:07,551 --> 01:52:10,965
creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

1041
01:52:11,137 --> 01:52:14,380
<i>You can't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!</i>

1042
01:52:14,558 --> 01:52:16,345
<i>I'm gonna fucking kill you!</i>

1043
01:52:16,518 --> 01:52:19,682
<i>You can't make me do anything.
You old, white prick!</i>

1044
01:52:21,982 --> 01:52:23,473
Choice.

1045
01:52:23,650 --> 01:52:25,482
The problem is choice.

1046
01:52:47,715 --> 01:52:51,334
The first Matrix I designed
was naturally perfect, a work of art.

1047
01:52:51,510 --> 01:52:53,342
Flawless, sublime.

1048
01:52:53,512 --> 01:52:57,005
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.

1049
01:52:57,683 --> 01:53:00,096
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now...

1050
01:53:00,269 --> 01:53:03,603
as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human.

1051
01:53:03,772 --> 01:53:06,731
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history...

1052
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:10,894
to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

1053
01:53:11,614 --> 01:53:15,358
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.

1054
01:53:16,827 --> 01:53:19,444
I have come to understand
that the answer eluded me...

1055
01:53:19,622 --> 01:53:21,658
because it required a lesser mind.

1056
01:53:21,831 --> 01:53:27,793
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.

1057
01:53:28,212 --> 01:53:32,627
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program...

1058
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:37,591
initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.

1059
01:53:37,764 --> 01:53:43,726
If I am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.

1060
01:53:44,354 --> 01:53:46,641
- The Oracle.
- Please.

1061
01:53:47,357 --> 01:53:51,351
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a
solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...

1062
01:53:51,527 --> 01:53:54,395
accepted the program, as long as they
were given a choice...

1063
01:53:54,572 --> 01:53:58,691
even if they were only aware
of the choice at a near unconscious level.

1064
01:53:58,868 --> 01:54:02,281
While this answer functioned,
it was fundamentally flawed...

1065
01:54:02,454 --> 01:54:06,448
thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...

1066
01:54:06,625 --> 01:54:09,333
that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system.

1067
01:54:09,711 --> 01:54:13,830
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...

1068
01:54:14,007 --> 01:54:18,092
would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

1069
01:54:18,261 --> 01:54:20,048
This is about Zion.

1070
01:54:20,514 --> 01:54:24,178
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

1071
01:54:24,351 --> 01:54:28,766
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

1072
01:54:29,064 --> 01:54:30,100
Bullshit.

1073
01:54:30,273 --> 01:54:33,437
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

1074
01:54:33,652 --> 01:54:40,115
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...

1075
01:54:40,283 --> 01:54:44,277
and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

1076
01:54:57,007 --> 01:54:58,293
The function of the One...

1077
01:54:58,467 --> 01:55:03,132
is now to return to the source, allowing
a dissemination of the code you carry...

1078
01:55:03,305 --> 01:55:05,012
reinserting the prime program.

1079
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:09,593
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals...

1080
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:13,013
sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

1081
01:55:13,190 --> 01:55:17,730
Failure to comply with this process will
result in a cataclysmic system crash...

1082
01:55:17,903 --> 01:55:20,236
killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...

1083
01:55:20,406 --> 01:55:22,989
which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...

1084
01:55:23,159 --> 01:55:27,368
will result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

1085
01:55:27,704 --> 01:55:31,789
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

1086
01:55:32,584 --> 01:55:36,203
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

1087
01:55:36,379 --> 01:55:39,167
The relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...

1088
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:42,924
to accept the responsibility for the
death of every human being in this world.

1089
01:55:49,392 --> 01:55:51,930
It is interesting reading your reactions.

1090
01:55:52,979 --> 01:55:56,814
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...

1091
01:55:56,983 --> 01:56:01,444
a contingent affirmation that was meant
to create a profound attachment...

1092
01:56:01,613 --> 01:56:05,197
to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

1093
01:56:05,366 --> 01:56:07,699
While the others experience this
in a general way...

1094
01:56:07,869 --> 01:56:10,827
your experience is far more specific...

1095
01:56:11,163 --> 01:56:14,031
vis-à-vis love.

1096
01:56:15,042 --> 01:56:16,658
Trinity!

1097
01:56:18,962 --> 01:56:23,297
Apropos, she entered the Matrix
to save your life at the cost of her own.

1098
01:56:23,675 --> 01:56:24,711
No.

1099
01:56:25,427 --> 01:56:29,546
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...

1100
01:56:29,723 --> 01:56:32,807
is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...

1101
01:56:32,976 --> 01:56:36,970
as both beginning and end.

1102
01:56:37,147 --> 01:56:38,809
There are two doors.

1103
01:56:38,982 --> 01:56:42,191
The door to your right leads to the source
and the salvation of Zion.

1104
01:56:42,778 --> 01:56:49,070
The door to your left leads back to the
Matrix, to her and the end of your species.

1105
01:56:49,243 --> 01:56:53,612
As you adequately put,
the problem is choice.

1106
01:56:53,788 --> 01:56:57,281
But we already know what
you are going to do, don't we?

1107
01:56:57,458 --> 01:57:01,543
Already I can see the chain reaction,
the chemical precursors that signal...

1108
01:57:01,712 --> 01:57:06,958
the onset of an emotion designed
specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.

1109
01:57:07,134 --> 01:57:11,754
An emotion that is already blinding you
from the simple and obvious truth:

1110
01:57:11,931 --> 01:57:18,428
She is going to die and there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

1111
01:57:23,442 --> 01:57:27,561
Hope. It is the quintessential
human delusion, simultaneously...

1112
01:57:27,738 --> 01:57:31,448
the source of your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness.

1113
01:57:31,617 --> 01:57:35,951
If I were you, I would hope
that we don't meet again.

1114
01:57:36,121 --> 01:57:37,532
We won't.

1115
01:57:44,963 --> 01:57:47,171
We got a serious situation, sir.

1116
01:57:47,632 --> 01:57:48,713
Oh, no.

1117
01:58:48,359 --> 01:58:49,246
What was that?

1118
01:58:49,258 --> 01:58:51,898
It's moving faster
than anything I've seen.

1119
01:59:42,536 --> 01:59:44,323
Holy shit, he caught her.

1120
01:59:58,260 --> 02:00:00,092
Neo, I had to.

1121
02:00:00,262 --> 02:00:02,003
I know.

1122
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:09,598
The bullet is still inside.

1123
02:00:20,365 --> 02:00:22,277
Trinity...

1124
02:00:23,492 --> 02:00:25,199
don't you quit on me now.

1125
02:00:34,378 --> 02:00:36,961
I'm sorry.

1126
02:00:43,471 --> 02:00:45,758
Trinity.

1127
02:00:55,733 --> 02:00:57,690
Trinity...

1128
02:00:57,860 --> 02:00:59,647
I know you can hear me.

1129
02:01:00,446 --> 02:01:02,984
I'm not letting go.

1130
02:01:03,157 --> 02:01:04,773
I can't.

1131
02:01:05,992 --> 02:01:08,200
I love you too damn much.

1132
02:01:36,898 --> 02:01:38,184
I can't take this.

1133
02:01:41,945 --> 02:01:45,029
I guess this makes us even.

1134
02:01:57,709 --> 02:01:59,666
I don't understand it.

1135
02:01:59,837 --> 02:02:02,830
Everything was done
as it was supposed to be done.

1136
02:02:03,006 --> 02:02:06,044
Once the One reaches the source,
the war should be over.

1137
02:02:06,218 --> 02:02:09,052
- In 24 hours, it will be.
- What?

1138
02:02:09,221 --> 02:02:13,556
If we don't do something in 24 hours,
Zion will be destroyed.

1139
02:02:13,976 --> 02:02:15,592
- What?
- How do you know that?

1140
02:02:16,061 --> 02:02:18,098
- I was told it would happen.
- By whom?

1141
02:02:19,106 --> 02:02:21,940
It doesn't matter. I believed him.

1142
02:02:22,109 --> 02:02:24,547
That's impossible.
The prophecy tells us...

1143
02:02:24,559 --> 02:02:25,944
It was a lie, Morpheus.

1144
02:02:27,698 --> 02:02:30,236
The prophecy was a lie.

1145
02:02:31,450 --> 02:02:34,443
The One was never meant
to end anything.

1146
02:02:34,620 --> 02:02:37,658
It was all another system of control.

1147
02:02:37,832 --> 02:02:40,916
I don't believe that.

1148
02:02:41,252 --> 02:02:43,585
But you said it yourself.

1149
02:02:43,754 --> 02:02:47,748
How can the prophecy be true
if the war isn't over?

1150
02:02:53,931 --> 02:02:56,389
I'm sorry.

1151
02:02:56,559 --> 02:02:59,927
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...

1152
02:03:00,104 --> 02:03:03,268
I swear to you it's the truth.

1153
02:03:06,485 --> 02:03:09,193
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

1154
02:03:11,407 --> 02:03:12,614
Oh, no!

1155
02:03:21,958 --> 02:03:25,292
- What are they doing?
- They're just out of EMP range.

1156
02:03:25,795 --> 02:03:27,036
It's a bomb.

1157
02:03:28,215 --> 02:03:30,423
We have to get out of here. Now.

1158
02:04:07,127 --> 02:04:08,993
I have dreamed a dream...

1159
02:04:12,049 --> 02:04:15,417
but now that dream
has gone from me.

1160
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:28,722
Here they come.

1161
02:04:28,983 --> 02:04:30,690
Let's go, Morpheus.

1162
02:04:32,111 --> 02:04:35,149
- We won't make it.
- We have to try.

1163
02:04:42,870 --> 02:04:45,863
- Come on!
- Something's different.

1164
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:48,032
What?

1165
02:04:48,710 --> 02:04:50,201
I can feel them.

1166
02:05:13,151 --> 02:05:14,733
Neo!

1167
02:05:20,907 --> 02:05:24,491
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1168
02:05:29,750 --> 02:05:31,662
It's the <i>Hammer.</i>

1169
02:05:43,347 --> 02:05:46,055
He's in some kind of coma...

1170
02:05:46,224 --> 02:05:48,466
but his vitals are stable.

1171
02:05:49,686 --> 02:05:51,598
What about you?

1172
02:05:51,772 --> 02:05:53,889
I'm fine.

1173
02:05:54,066 --> 02:05:56,433
You could use some rest.

1174
02:05:56,610 --> 02:05:58,442
No, I'm gonna stay with him.

1175
02:06:05,534 --> 02:06:08,151
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines...

1176
02:06:08,329 --> 02:06:11,197
would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.

1177
02:06:11,374 --> 02:06:14,117
He thought a counterattack
might surprise them.

1178
02:06:14,377 --> 02:06:17,791
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot...

1179
02:06:18,130 --> 02:06:20,668
until someone screwed it up.

1180
02:06:20,841 --> 02:06:23,458
An EMP was triggered before
we got in position.

1181
02:06:23,636 --> 02:06:25,502
Five ships were instantly downed.

1182
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:27,466
When the machines broke through...

1183
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:30,849
it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

1184
02:06:31,018 --> 02:06:33,852
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?

1185
02:06:34,021 --> 02:06:36,479
- No one knows.
- Someone does.

1186
02:06:36,649 --> 02:06:38,390
Who?

1187
02:06:38,567 --> 02:06:42,277
Once the machines were done with us,
they started digging again.

1188
02:06:42,446 --> 02:06:44,732
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.

1189
02:06:44,948 --> 02:06:46,029
You found one?

1190
02:06:47,784 --> 02:06:49,491
Only one.

1191
02:16:42,572 --> 02:16:45,861
<i>Everything that has a beginning...</i>

1192
02:16:46,034 --> 02:16:47,741
<i>has an end.</i>

1193
02:16:50,163 --> 02:16:53,031
<i>I see the end coming.</i>

1194
02:16:53,208 --> 02:16:56,997
<i>I see the darkness spreading.
I see death.</i>

1195
02:16:59,131 --> 02:17:02,124
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

1196
02:17:02,300 --> 02:17:04,292
We missed you.

1197
02:17:04,469 --> 02:17:06,301
It ends tonight.

1198
02:17:13,520 --> 02:17:16,638
<i>You are all that stands in his way.</i>

1199
02:17:18,233 --> 02:17:22,772
<i>If you cannot stop him tonight,
then I fear that tomorrow may never come.</i>
