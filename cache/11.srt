1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I am the fastest man alive.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
In an attempt to stop
the evil speedster Savitar,

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I was accidentally thrust into the future,

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I saw him murder the woman I love.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
But I won't let that happen.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I'm going to do everything in my power

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
to change the future, and I'm the only one

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
fast enough to keep her alive.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I am The Flash.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,757
&nbsp

27
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,257
<i>Previously on The Flash...</i>

28
00:00:02,267 --> 00:00:02,259
&nbsp

29
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,625
When I threw the Philosopher's Stone

30
00:00:03,635 --> 00:00:03,627
&nbsp

31
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:04,993
into the Speed Force, I accidentally

32
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:04,995
&nbsp

33
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,127
ran into the future.

34
00:00:06,137 --> 00:00:06,129
&nbsp

35
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,562
I saw Savitar murder you.

36
00:00:07,572 --> 00:00:07,564
&nbsp

37
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,664
I wasn't fast enough to save you.

38
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:09,666
&nbsp

39
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,199
We can't do this alone, Barry.

40
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:11,201
&nbsp

41
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:12,867
Why don't you come work with us?

42
00:00:12,877 --> 00:00:12,869
&nbsp

43
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:15,003
You can help Team Flash fight meta-humans.

44
00:00:15,013 --> 00:00:15,005
&nbsp

45
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,738
- Welcome to the team.
- Yeah.

46
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:16,740
&nbsp

47
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,107
If his powers are linked to the energy

48
00:00:19,117 --> 00:00:19,109
&nbsp

49
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,276
that ties together the multiverse...

50
00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:21,278
&nbsp

51
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:23,178
He can open a breach to any Earth he wants.

52
00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:34,057
&nbsp

53
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,491
The thing they never tell you
about fighting villains

54
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:36,493
&nbsp

55
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,960
is that nothing ever stays the same.

56
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:38,962
&nbsp

57
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:42,063
The harder you work
to take down the bad guys,

58
00:00:42,073 --> 00:00:42,065
&nbsp

59
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,099
the more they up their game.

60
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:44,101
&nbsp

61
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,333
Gentlemen,

62
00:00:45,343 --> 00:00:45,335
&nbsp

63
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:48,470
welcome to the future of crime.

64
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:48,472
&nbsp

65
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,171
Not even the military has these yet.

66
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:50,173
&nbsp

67
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,707
Looks like Christmas came early.

68
00:00:52,717 --> 00:00:52,709
&nbsp

69
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,409
You know what the only problem is?

70
00:00:54,419 --> 00:00:54,411
&nbsp

71
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,511
You're on Santa's naughty list.

72
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:57,714
&nbsp

73
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,481
Christmas is canceled.

74
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:02,085
&nbsp

75
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:05,987
Fortunately, our team
has a secret weapon of its own:

76
00:01:05,997 --> 00:01:05,989
&nbsp

77
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,556
a man of science, a man of action,

78
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:08,558
&nbsp

79
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,425
and that man's name

80
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:10,427
&nbsp

81
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,061
is H.R. Wells.

82
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:13,063
&nbsp

83
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,630
Look who has a vortex cannon.

84
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:15,632
&nbsp

85
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:19,134
Ho, ho, ho.

86
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:25,242
&nbsp

87
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,808
H.R.?

88
00:01:26,818 --> 00:01:26,810
&nbsp

89
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,243
H.R.?

90
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:28,245
&nbsp

91
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,945
With a blast from my trusty vortex cannon,

92
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:30,947
&nbsp

93
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,947
- I dispatch the miscreant...
- H.R.

94
00:01:32,957 --> 00:01:32,949
&nbsp

95
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,783
- Hey, yep, here we are.
- Barry needs help.

96
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:34,785
&nbsp

97
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,618
- Yeah, Barry needs help.
- Where's Kid Flash?

98
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:36,620
&nbsp

99
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,153
He's on his way. Are you on your way?

100
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:38,155
&nbsp

101
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,788
They need you at Keystone Bridge.

102
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:39,790
&nbsp

103
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,689
Surely all your adventures
are not this disorganized?

104
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:41,691
&nbsp

105
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:42,957
There's a method to the madness, mate.

106
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:42,959
&nbsp

107
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,492
Watch and learn.

108
00:01:44,502 --> 00:01:44,494
&nbsp

109
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,194
The Electric Gang is headed north.

110
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:46,196
&nbsp

111
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,062
You gotta cut 'em off
before they reach the freeway.

112
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:54,337
&nbsp

113
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,370
Oh, hey.

114
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:55,372
&nbsp

115
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:56,371
How you wanna play this?

116
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:56,373
&nbsp

117
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:57,806
I have an idea.

118
00:01:57,816 --> 00:02:00,844
&nbsp

119
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,577
Eyes up!

120
00:02:02,587 --> 00:02:02,579
&nbsp

121
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,845
Here he comes.

122
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:03,847
&nbsp

123
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,079
Just the red one.

124
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:31,174
&nbsp

125
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,341
Nice work.

126
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:33,343
&nbsp

127
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,743
They're out cold.

128
00:02:35,753 --> 00:02:35,745
&nbsp

129
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,779
Okay, boys.

130
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:37,781
&nbsp

131
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,080
They saved us.

132
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:39,082
&nbsp

133
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,815
They saved us!

134
00:02:40,825 --> 00:02:40,817
&nbsp

135
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,085
- Who are you?
- Um...

136
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:44,087
&nbsp

137
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,386
I'm Kid Flash.

138
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:45,388
&nbsp

139
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,655
Oh, my gosh. Can we get your picture?

140
00:02:47,665 --> 00:02:47,657
&nbsp

141
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,090
Yes.

142
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,661
&nbsp

143
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,528
Whoo.

144
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:53,530
&nbsp

145
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,363
Okay. Bye.

146
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:55,365
&nbsp

147
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,732
- Go Kid Flash!
- Go Kid Flash!

148
00:02:57,742 --> 00:03:01,412

Nice save!

&nbsp

153
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,847
Could not have scripted it better myself.

154
00:03:12,857 --> 00:03:12,849
&nbsp

155
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,315
Thanks.

156
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:14,317
&nbsp

157
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,984
Barry did most of the heavy lifting.

158
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:15,986
&nbsp

159
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,485
- B.A.
- Yes, bravo, boys.

160
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:17,487
&nbsp

161
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,521
Although I did find at least six ways

162
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:19,523
&nbsp

163
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,055
you could have done it more efficiently,

164
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:21,057
&nbsp

165
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,357
just... just saying.

166
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:22,359
&nbsp

167
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,958
I mean, the busload of hot cheerleaders

168
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:23,960
&nbsp

169
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,493
seemed like the way that we did things.

170
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:25,495
&nbsp

171
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,061
Oh, that's going in the book. You know what?

172
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:27,063
&nbsp

173
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,730
I'm running low;
let me buy you a cup of coffee

174
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:28,732
&nbsp

175
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,031
over at CC Jitters.

176
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:30,033
&nbsp

177
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,233
- Bond, are you coming?
- No, thank you.

178
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:32,235
&nbsp

179
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,903
So exactly how many hot cheerleaders?

180
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:34,905
&nbsp

181
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,437
I was a good boy.

182
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:36,439
&nbsp

183
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,106
You know, he's just been
looking forward to this

184
00:03:38,116 --> 00:03:38,108
&nbsp

185
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,407
for a long time; he's enjoying the moment.

186
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:39,409
&nbsp

187
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,675
Well, I'm glad you have his back.

188
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:40,677
&nbsp

189
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,277
We have each other's back.

190
00:03:42,287 --> 00:03:42,279
&nbsp

191
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,645
It's actually been really nice
having him out there.

192
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:43,647
&nbsp

193
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:44,913
Hey, I meant to ask you.

194
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:44,915
&nbsp

195
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,681
When you found the Electric Gang,

196
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:46,683
&nbsp

197
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,983
did you see them meeting with anyone else?

198
00:03:48,993 --> 00:03:48,985
&nbsp

199
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,485
- Like who?
- Well, word on the street is,

200
00:03:50,495 --> 00:03:50,487
&nbsp

201
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:51,986
there is a new arms dealer in town

202
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:51,988
&nbsp

203
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,755
with access to sophisticated weaponry

204
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:53,757
&nbsp

205
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,323
like the gun that Plunder used.

206
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:55,325
&nbsp

207
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,457
Don't you think that's something

208
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:56,459
&nbsp

209
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,692
for the police to handle?

210
00:03:57,702 --> 00:03:57,694
&nbsp

211
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,394
I'm still a journalist, Barry.

212
00:03:59,404 --> 00:03:59,396
&nbsp

213
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,462
I can't hide from the world
because of what you saw.

214
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:01,464
&nbsp

215
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,665
See you at home.

216
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:09,940
&nbsp

217
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,606
Can't lose her, Cisco.

218
00:04:11,616 --> 00:04:11,608
&nbsp

219
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,475
Please tell me you found
a way to change the future.

220
00:04:14,485 --> 00:04:14,477
&nbsp

221
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,844
We found a way to change the future.

222
00:04:16,854 --> 00:04:16,846
&nbsp

223
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,313
Did you really?

224
00:04:18,323 --> 00:04:18,315
&nbsp

225
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:21,783
No, but Caitlin and I
did find a way to map it.

226
00:04:21,793 --> 00:04:21,785
&nbsp

227
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,751
You're gonna love this. Follow me.

228
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:26,756
&nbsp

229
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,290
Julian suggested we make
a 3-D reconstruction

230
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,292
&nbsp

231
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,826
of the scene from the future
exactly as we saw it.

232
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:31,828
&nbsp

233
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,661
With toys.

234
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:33,663
&nbsp

235
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,063
The medium's not important.

236
00:04:35,073 --> 00:04:35,065
&nbsp

237
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,931
Thank you. Eye on the ball, Barry.

238
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:36,933
&nbsp

239
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,066
Is this me?

240
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:38,068
&nbsp

241
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:39,233
Why is he an astronaut?

242
00:04:39,243 --> 00:04:39,235
&nbsp

243
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,370
Eye on the ball, Barry, okay?

244
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:42,372
&nbsp

245
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,138
Now, this diorama tells us

246
00:04:44,148 --> 00:04:44,140
&nbsp

247
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,674
you need to cover this distance

248
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:46,676
&nbsp

249
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,142
in less than 0.21 seconds

250
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:48,144
&nbsp

251
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,745
if you want to save Iris from Savitar.

252
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:50,747
&nbsp

253
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,347
What do you guys think?

254
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:52,349
&nbsp

255
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,582
Think what you're proposing is impossible.

256
00:04:54,592 --> 00:04:54,584
&nbsp

257
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,951
- Therefore, you will fail.
- Why?

258
00:04:56,961 --> 00:04:56,953
&nbsp

259
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,820
Multi-universe is maybe a new concept to me,

260
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:58,822
&nbsp

261
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,355
but mathematics is not.

262
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:00,357
&nbsp

263
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:01,789
Pay attention, Allen.

264
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:03,326
&nbsp

265
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,060
This is your speed timeline.

266
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,365
&nbsp

267
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,098
This is your maximum velocity

268
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:10,100
&nbsp

269
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,533
when you first acquired your powers.

270
00:05:12,543 --> 00:05:12,535
&nbsp

271
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:15,003
This is your current top speed,

272
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:15,005
&nbsp

273
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:18,506
and this is where you need to be

274
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:18,508
&nbsp

275
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,843
in May to cover that distance
in 0.21 seconds.

276
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:21,845
&nbsp

277
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,678
At your current rate of improvement,

278
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:23,680
&nbsp

279
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,846
impossible.

280
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:24,848
&nbsp

281
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,314
Wow.

282
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:26,316
&nbsp

283
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,683
Thank you for that rousing pep talk, coach.

284
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:28,685
&nbsp

285
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:29,917
Okay, why don't you take a knee?

286
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:29,919
&nbsp

287
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,719
I think we got it covered here.

288
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:31,721
&nbsp

289
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:32,887
It looks like it.

290
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:32,889
&nbsp

291
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,622
I actually have to be back at CCPD.

292
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:34,624
&nbsp

293
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,190
As do you.

294
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,192
&nbsp

295
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,092
Cheerio.

296
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:38,094
&nbsp

297
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,727
He really does want to help

298
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:39,729
&nbsp

299
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,497
in his own snobbish, thoughtless way.

300
00:05:42,507 --> 00:05:42,499
&nbsp

301
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,865
He is right.

302
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:43,867
&nbsp

303
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,466
I mean, he's kind of a dick about it,

304
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:45,468
&nbsp

305
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,101
but you can't argue with his math.

306
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:47,103
&nbsp

307
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,670
Okay, well, then, we'll find another way

308
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:48,672
&nbsp

309
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,771
to make this work.

310
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:49,773
&nbsp

311
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:50,872
We need to.

312
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:50,874
&nbsp

313
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,874
Iris isn't gonna die.

314
00:05:52,884 --> 00:06:23,573
&nbsp

315
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,806
Thank you very much.

316
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:27,110
&nbsp

317
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,309
Gotcha.

318
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:28,311
&nbsp

319
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,144
Freeze!

320
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:32,982
&nbsp

321
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,315
How'd you get in here?

322
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:34,317
&nbsp

323
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,750
You know what they say.

324
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:35,752
&nbsp

325
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,719
Every time a door closes...

326
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:42,125
&nbsp

327
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,791
A window opens.

328
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:51,634
&nbsp

329
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,000
Barry.

330
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:53,002
&nbsp

331
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,435
- Hey.
- Nothing's missing.

332
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:54,437
&nbsp

333
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,671
- Nope.
- Cash is still in the register.

334
00:06:56,681 --> 00:06:56,673
&nbsp

335
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,106
Safe's not touched.

336
00:06:58,116 --> 00:06:58,108
&nbsp

337
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,707
I mean, it seems like a lot to go through

338
00:06:59,717 --> 00:06:59,709
&nbsp

339
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,476
to just get a late night
cup of coffee, right?

340
00:07:01,486 --> 00:07:01,478
&nbsp

341
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,010
Yeah, it's definitely a meta.

342
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,012
&nbsp

343
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,946
I'll have Julian look into
his meta database,

344
00:07:04,956 --> 00:07:04,948
&nbsp

345
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,614
but I think this is someone new.

346
00:07:06,624 --> 00:07:06,616
&nbsp

347
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,082
New and dangerous.

348
00:07:08,092 --> 00:07:08,084
&nbsp

349
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,585
Well, it's nothing that The Flash

350
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:10,587
&nbsp

351
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,520
and Kid Flash can't handle.

352
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:12,522
&nbsp

353
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,155
My two superhero boys.

354
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:14,157
&nbsp

355
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,189
He is doing great.

356
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,191
&nbsp

357
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,524
Speaking of my kids,

358
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:16,526
&nbsp

359
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,659
Iris, she tell you about this

360
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:18,661
&nbsp

361
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,394
arms dealer story she's following?

362
00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:20,396
&nbsp

363
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,230
Yeah, she's mentioned it.

364
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,232
&nbsp

365
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,198
Well, now that you're her live-in boyfriend,

366
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:24,200
&nbsp

367
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,067
could you look out for her

368
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:26,069
&nbsp

369
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,969
and maybe get her to back off a bit?

370
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:27,971
&nbsp

371
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,670
Because this isn't something
she should be doing on her own.

372
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:29,672
&nbsp

373
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:30,972
I agree. I'm trying.

374
00:07:30,982 --> 00:07:30,974
&nbsp

375
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,775
She seem... okay to you, otherwise?

376
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:33,777
&nbsp

377
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,877
Yeah, why? Do you not think so?

378
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:35,879
&nbsp

379
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,746
If you guys got something going on,

380
00:07:38,756 --> 00:07:38,748
&nbsp

381
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,481
I hope you know you can talk to me.

382
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:40,483
&nbsp

383
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,717
Yeah, I know, Joe.

384
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:42,719
&nbsp

385
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,485
Thank you... I... we're...

386
00:07:44,495 --> 00:07:44,487
&nbsp

387
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,454
both doing great.

388
00:07:46,464 --> 00:07:46,456
&nbsp

389
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,322
Okay.

390
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:48,324
&nbsp

391
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,158
- All right.
- Talk to you later.

392
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:50,160
&nbsp

393
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,659
Yeah.

394
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:57,556
&nbsp

395
00:07:57,566 --> 00:07:59,556
So this is the footage from Jitters

396
00:07:59,566 --> 00:07:59,558
&nbsp

397
00:07:59,568 --> 00:08:01,458
that should help us ID our new meta.

398
00:08:01,468 --> 00:08:01,460
&nbsp

399
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,226
Brunette? That really narrows it down.

400
00:08:03,236 --> 00:08:03,228
&nbsp

401
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:04,761
Mm, I'll clean that up.

402
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:04,763
&nbsp

403
00:08:04,773 --> 00:08:06,663
Oh, look how clear
the picture is on that screen.

404
00:08:06,673 --> 00:08:06,665
&nbsp

405
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:08,465
That's 'cause that's not from Jitters.

406
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:08,467
&nbsp

407
00:08:08,477 --> 00:08:09,666
That's our security footage.

408
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:09,668
&nbsp

409
00:08:09,678 --> 00:08:11,134
H.R. Wells.

410
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:11,136
&nbsp

411
00:08:11,146 --> 00:08:12,669
I know you're in there.

412
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:12,671
&nbsp

413
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:15,405
Come quietly if you don't want trouble.

414
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:15,407
&nbsp

415
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:17,140
H.R., how does she know you?

416
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,142
&nbsp

417
00:08:17,152 --> 00:08:20,510
Talk. Who is this... gorgeous intruder?

418
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:20,512
&nbsp

419
00:08:20,522 --> 00:08:22,345
Her name is Gypsy,

420
00:08:22,355 --> 00:08:22,347
&nbsp

421
00:08:22,357 --> 00:08:26,316
and she's what's known
on my Earth as a collector.

422
00:08:26,326 --> 00:08:26,318
&nbsp

423
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:27,684
What is she collecting?

424
00:08:27,694 --> 00:08:27,686
&nbsp

425
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:31,020
She's come to collect, you know, me.

426
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,290
&nbsp

427
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,423
Oh!

428
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:54,858
&nbsp

429
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:58,893
- Where does it hurt?
- Oh, everywhere.

430
00:08:58,903 --> 00:08:58,941
&nbsp

431
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:00,875
You can vibe?

432
00:09:00,885 --> 00:09:00,877
&nbsp

433
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:01,976
Oh, I like it.

434
00:09:01,986 --> 00:09:01,978
&nbsp

435
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:03,444
Slow down there.

436
00:09:03,454 --> 00:09:03,446
&nbsp

437
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:06,147
Let's just talk about this, like two adults,

438
00:09:06,157 --> 00:09:06,149
&nbsp

439
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,183
over coffee, or maybe dinner,
if you prefer that.

440
00:09:09,193 --> 00:09:09,185
&nbsp

441
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:12,486
There's a great Thai place
up the road, if you like Thai.

442
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:12,488
&nbsp

443
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:14,221
I'm Cisco, by the way. You must be Gypsy.

444
00:09:14,231 --> 00:09:14,223
&nbsp

445
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:15,456
It's nice to meet you.

446
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:15,458
&nbsp

447
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:16,891
Are you asking her on a date?

448
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:16,893
&nbsp

449
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:17,892
Are you kidding me?

450
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:17,894
&nbsp

451
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:19,593
I am negotiating.

452
00:09:19,603 --> 00:09:19,595
&nbsp

453
00:09:19,605 --> 00:09:21,195
Well, you showed me yours.

454
00:09:21,205 --> 00:09:21,197
&nbsp

455
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:22,763
Only fair I show you mine.

456
00:09:22,773 --> 00:09:27,236
&nbsp

457
00:09:27,246 --> 00:09:28,335
Cisco!

458
00:09:28,345 --> 00:09:31,407
&nbsp

459
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:33,607
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave the building.

460
00:09:33,617 --> 00:09:33,609
&nbsp

461
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:35,109
Speedster.

462
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:35,111
&nbsp

463
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:36,710
That's fun.

464
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:36,712
&nbsp

465
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:38,345
I like to have fun too.

466
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:43,319
&nbsp

467
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:45,619
I see you've got a lot
to learn about your power.

468
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:45,621
&nbsp

469
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:47,521
Yeah. Like that.

470
00:09:47,531 --> 00:09:47,523
&nbsp

471
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:49,023
How do you do that? That's cool.

472
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:56,096
&nbsp

473
00:09:56,106 --> 00:09:58,430
You're harboring a fugitive from justice.

474
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:58,432
&nbsp

475
00:09:58,442 --> 00:10:01,232
Our world has a strict ban
on inter-dimensional travel.

476
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:01,234
&nbsp

477
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:03,001
He knew that when he came here.

478
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:03,003
&nbsp

479
00:10:03,013 --> 00:10:05,236
- So you tracked him here?
- Honestly, it wasn't that hard.

480
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:05,238
&nbsp

481
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:06,972
Not when he's beaming "H.R. Wells'

482
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:06,974
&nbsp

483
00:10:06,984 --> 00:10:10,408
Adventures in the Multiverse"
back chapter by chapter.

484
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:10,410
&nbsp

485
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,043
You know what? Whatever H.R. did,

486
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:12,045
&nbsp

487
00:10:12,055 --> 00:10:13,878
you can't just come here
and take him by force.

488
00:10:13,888 --> 00:10:13,880
&nbsp

489
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,180
Not without going through us.

490
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,182
&nbsp

491
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:17,716
If I really wanted to go through you,

492
00:10:17,726 --> 00:10:17,718
&nbsp

493
00:10:17,728 --> 00:10:19,017
you would all be dead.

494
00:10:19,027 --> 00:10:19,019
&nbsp

495
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:20,719
I've got a lock on you now.

496
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:20,721
&nbsp

497
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:22,320
There is no getting away.

498
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:22,322
&nbsp

499
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:24,022
You've got an hour
to get your affairs in order,

500
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:24,024
&nbsp

501
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:25,490
and then you are coming back with me.

502
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,729
&nbsp

503
00:10:28,739 --> 00:10:30,161
Adios, Cisco.

504
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:34,067
&nbsp

505
00:10:34,077 --> 00:10:35,700
What an exit.

506
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,302
&nbsp

507
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:40,136
"As Francisco threw back his lustrous locks

508

509

"and laughed, I outlined my plan

&nbsp

511
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,041
for neutralizing the rampaging creature."

512
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:45,043
&nbsp

513
00:10:45,053 --> 00:10:46,576
It goes on like this for pages.

514
00:10:46,586 --> 00:10:46,578
&nbsp

515
00:10:46,588 --> 00:10:47,877
He's been broadcasting this

516
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:47,879
&nbsp

517
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,345
without our knowledge or permission,

518
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:49,347
&nbsp

519
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,348
all the while making himself the hero.

520
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:52,350
&nbsp

521
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,351
Yeah, every book needs a central protagonist

522
00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:55,353
&nbsp

523
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,420
that the audience can invest in.

524
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,422
&nbsp

525
00:10:57,432 --> 00:10:58,721
I would have gone with Barry.

526
00:10:58,731 --> 00:10:58,723
&nbsp

527
00:10:58,733 --> 00:10:59,956
Barry?

528
00:10:59,966 --> 00:10:59,958
&nbsp

529
00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:01,658
Cisco, what was that back there?

530
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:01,660
&nbsp

531
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,593
First Golden Glider and now her?

532
00:11:03,603 --> 00:11:03,595
&nbsp

533
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:05,695
I can't help who I'm attracted to,

534
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:05,697
&nbsp

535
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,263
even if it is the...

536
00:11:07,273 --> 00:11:07,265
&nbsp

537
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:11,134
sexy, intense, deadly ones.

538
00:11:11,144 --> 00:11:11,136
&nbsp

539
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:12,502
So she takes you back to Earth-19,

540
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:12,504
&nbsp

541
00:11:12,514 --> 00:11:13,703
and, what, you pay a fine?

542
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:13,705
&nbsp

543
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,004
The punishment for

544
00:11:15,014 --> 00:11:15,006
&nbsp

545
00:11:15,016 --> 00:11:18,775
an unauthorized breach travel on my Earth...

546
00:11:18,785 --> 00:11:18,777
&nbsp

547
00:11:18,787 --> 00:11:20,443
it's death.

548
00:11:20,453 --> 00:11:20,445
&nbsp

549
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:21,878
Death?

550
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:21,880
&nbsp

551
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,614
About 24, 25 years ago, a neighboring Earth

552
00:11:24,624 --> 00:11:24,616
&nbsp

553
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:26,616
invaded our planet through a breach

554
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:26,618
&nbsp

555
00:11:26,628 --> 00:11:27,850
and almost destroyed the place.

556
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:27,852
&nbsp

557
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:29,919
So to prevent it from happening again,

558
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:29,921
&nbsp

559
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:31,788
they banned all inter-dimensional travel.

560
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:31,790
&nbsp

561
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,289
And then they put the collectors in place

562
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:33,291
&nbsp

563
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:36,259
to punish those of us who violated the ban.

564
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:36,261
&nbsp

565
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:38,327
I didn't think that she'd track me down.

566
00:11:38,337 --> 00:11:38,329
&nbsp

567
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,264
So why would you
risk your life by coming here?

568
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:41,266
&nbsp

569
00:11:41,276 --> 00:11:44,167
I... I'm gonna get packing.

570
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:44,169
&nbsp

571
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:46,302
It's time for H.R. to face the music.

572
00:11:46,312 --> 00:11:46,304
&nbsp

573
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:47,603
Mm-hmm.

574
00:11:47,613 --> 00:11:49,274
&nbsp

575
00:11:49,284 --> 00:11:50,907
Guys, I know H.R. can be annoying,

576
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:50,909
&nbsp

577
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,142
but he doesn't deserve to die.

578
00:11:53,152 --> 00:11:53,144
&nbsp

579
00:11:53,154 --> 00:11:55,211
Different Earth, different morality.

580
00:11:55,221 --> 00:11:55,213
&nbsp

581
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:57,346
But he doesn't go back. I saw him.

582
00:11:57,356 --> 00:11:57,348
&nbsp

583
00:11:57,358 --> 00:12:00,183
In the future, with me and
Iris and Savitar, he was there.

584
00:12:00,193 --> 00:12:00,185
&nbsp

585
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:02,952
I mean, that must mean
we don't let her take him back.

586
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:02,954
&nbsp

587
00:12:02,964 --> 00:12:04,687
Maybe we do.

588
00:12:04,697 --> 00:12:04,689
&nbsp

589
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:06,556
Maybe by letting him go back to his Earth,

590
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:06,558
&nbsp

591
00:12:06,568 --> 00:12:07,824
it changes your future

592
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:07,826
&nbsp

593
00:12:07,836 --> 00:12:11,294
and prevents Iris' death.

594
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:11,296
&nbsp

595
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:14,297
I gotta go see her.

596
00:12:14,307 --> 00:12:17,836
&nbsp

597
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:20,303
Are you just gonna let this woman take H.R.?

598
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:20,305
&nbsp

599
00:12:20,315 --> 00:12:21,337
I don't know.

600
00:12:21,347 --> 00:12:21,339
&nbsp

601
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:23,506
No. I just...

602
00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:23,508
&nbsp

603
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:25,208
I wish I knew if it would make a difference.

604
00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:25,210
&nbsp

605
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,243
You know, I mean, what if
he goes and nothing changes?

606
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:27,245
&nbsp

607
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:31,481
How do we ever know if our
actions now impact the future?

608
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:31,483
&nbsp

609
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:33,082
Yeah.

610
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:33,084
&nbsp

611
00:12:33,094 --> 00:12:35,251
You know, sometimes I wish
we had normal-people problems.

612
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:35,253
&nbsp

613
00:12:35,263 --> 00:12:37,220
Yeah, that would be nice.

614
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:37,222
&nbsp

615
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:39,255
Hey, you didn't tell Joe

616
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:39,257
&nbsp

617
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,858
about the future, did you?

618
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:41,860
&nbsp

619
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,292
No, of course not.

620
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:43,294
&nbsp

621
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,361
The last thing I need
is for him to worry about

622
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:45,363
&nbsp

623
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:47,130
something four months away
that might not happen.

624
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,132
&nbsp

625
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,332
That won't happen.

626
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:49,334
&nbsp

627
00:12:49,344 --> 00:12:51,000
That won't happen.

628
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:51,002
&nbsp

629
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:52,401
Maybe in the meantime,

630
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:52,403
&nbsp

631
00:12:52,413 --> 00:12:54,971
you could let this arms dealer thing go?

632
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:54,973
&nbsp

633
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,006
Oh, God, did my dad put you up to this too?

634
00:12:57,016 --> 00:12:57,008
&nbsp

635
00:12:57,018 --> 00:12:58,474
No, he didn't have to.

636
00:12:58,484 --> 00:12:58,476
&nbsp

637
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,276
- Barry, look, this...
- No, look, I'm sorry.

638
00:13:00,286 --> 00:13:00,278
&nbsp

639
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:02,445
I'm not trying to keep you
from doing your job, okay?

640
00:13:02,455 --> 00:13:02,447
&nbsp

641
00:13:02,457 --> 00:13:05,481
But when we're all focused
on this H.R. thing

642
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:05,483
&nbsp

643
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,316
and trying to prevent the future.

644
00:13:07,326 --> 00:13:07,318
&nbsp

645
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,720
I mean, do we really need to go
looking for more trouble?

646
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:10,722
&nbsp

647
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:12,321
Please?

648
00:13:12,331 --> 00:13:12,323
&nbsp

649
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,623
Okay, I'll drop it.

650
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:13,625
&nbsp

651
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:15,558
Really? Just like that?

652
00:13:15,568 --> 00:13:15,560
&nbsp

653
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,959
Um, yes.

654
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:16,961
&nbsp

655
00:13:16,971 --> 00:13:18,427
Sometimes I do listen to you, you know?

656
00:13:18,437 --> 00:13:18,429
&nbsp

657
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:20,530
That hasn't been my experience.

658
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:20,532
&nbsp

659
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:22,431
Shut up.

660
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:22,433
&nbsp

661
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:23,633
All right. I'll see you later.

662
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:23,635
&nbsp

663
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:25,034
- 'Kay, bye.
- Thank you.

664
00:13:25,044 --> 00:13:32,343
&nbsp

665
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,477
Don't you get tired of running?

666
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:39,284
&nbsp

667
00:13:39,294 --> 00:13:40,817
That's the thing, running just

668
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:40,819
&nbsp

669
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:43,452
sort of keeps my mind
off of things, I guess.

670
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:43,454
&nbsp

671
00:13:43,464 --> 00:13:45,521
Must be an amazing feeling.

672
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:45,523
&nbsp

673
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,190
It is.

674
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,192
&nbsp

675
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:50,059
You know, cracking a big story
gives me an amazing feeling.

676
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,061
&nbsp

677
00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:52,361
And... I think I'm onto one.

678
00:13:52,371 --> 00:13:52,363
&nbsp

679
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,130
Oh, that, uh, arms dealer thing?

680
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:54,132
&nbsp

681
00:13:54,142 --> 00:13:55,731
How do you know about that?

682
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:55,733
&nbsp

683
00:13:55,743 --> 00:13:57,934
Because both Dad and Barry
want you to lay off of it.

684
00:13:57,944 --> 00:13:57,936
&nbsp

685
00:13:57,946 --> 00:14:00,603
The phrase "death wish"
got tossed around a lot

686
00:14:00,613 --> 00:14:00,605
&nbsp

687
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:01,771
by them.

688
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:01,773
&nbsp

689
00:14:01,783 --> 00:14:03,372
Okay, I do not have a death wish.

690
00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:03,374
&nbsp

691
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,174
I just want to see justice done

692
00:14:05,184 --> 00:14:05,176
&nbsp

693
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:06,576
like everyone else in this building.

694
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:06,578
&nbsp

695
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:09,512
I get that, but it is dangerous, Iris.

696
00:14:09,522 --> 00:14:09,514
&nbsp

697
00:14:09,524 --> 00:14:11,714
Wally, how dangerous could it be?

698
00:14:11,724 --> 00:14:11,716
&nbsp

699
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,916
I don't die till May.

700
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:13,918
&nbsp

701
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:16,586
Barry said that in Flashpoint, you and I

702
00:14:16,596 --> 00:14:16,588
&nbsp

703
00:14:16,598 --> 00:14:18,588
were a brother-sister crime-fighting team.

704
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:18,590
&nbsp

705
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,058
I say we make that a reality again.

706
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:22,060
&nbsp

707
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,693
Shouldn't we ask Barry first?

708
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:23,695
&nbsp

709
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:25,895
No, this is just between us, Wally.

710
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:25,897
&nbsp

711
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,363
We can do this together.

712
00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:34,372
&nbsp

713
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:38,307
Do you know what I'm really
gonna miss about this Earth?

714
00:14:38,317 --> 00:14:38,309
&nbsp

715
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:40,610
- I don't know. Uh...
- Soap operas.

716
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:40,612
&nbsp

717
00:14:40,622 --> 00:14:42,912
I mean, a long, winding story

718
00:14:42,922 --> 00:14:42,914
&nbsp

719
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,248
served up daily in hour-long chapters?

720
00:14:45,258 --> 00:14:45,250
&nbsp

721
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,949
You never answered Caitlin's question.

722
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:46,951
&nbsp

723
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:49,085
Oh, about why I put mustard on my fries?

724
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:49,087
&nbsp

725
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,121
Why you risked your life to come here.

726
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:52,123
&nbsp

727
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:54,657
That.

728
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:54,659
&nbsp

729
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:56,292
I looked in a mirror.

730
00:14:56,302 --> 00:14:56,294
&nbsp

731
00:14:56,304 --> 00:14:57,860
I don't follow.

732
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:57,862
&nbsp

733
00:14:57,872 --> 00:14:59,362
Look, on my Earth,

734
00:14:59,372 --> 00:14:59,364
&nbsp

735
00:14:59,374 --> 00:15:02,098
I had fame and power.

736
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:02,100
&nbsp

737
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,399
I had respect.

738
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:03,401
&nbsp

739
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:05,268
I was "H.R. Wells."

740
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:06,537
&nbsp

741
00:15:06,547 --> 00:15:08,437
But when I looked in the mirror,

742
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:08,439
&nbsp

743
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,872
I knew the truth.

744
00:15:09,882 --> 00:15:09,874
&nbsp

745
00:15:09,884 --> 00:15:12,842
And the truth was...

746
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:12,844
&nbsp

747
00:15:12,854 --> 00:15:14,343
I didn't matter.

748
00:15:14,353 --> 00:15:16,848
&nbsp

749
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:19,415
I was a fraud.

750
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:19,417
&nbsp

751
00:15:19,427 --> 00:15:21,350
That is why I came to this Earth,

752
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,352
&nbsp

753
00:15:21,362 --> 00:15:24,687
so I could rewrite my story,
both literally and figuratively.

754
00:15:24,697 --> 00:15:24,689
&nbsp

755
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:26,656
There's gotta be something you can do, H.R.

756
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:26,658
&nbsp

757
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:28,124
There's not.

758
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:28,126
&nbsp

759
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,659
You can't hire a lawyer? Appeal the case?

760
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:29,661
&nbsp

761
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:32,795
There's nothing I can do, B.A.!

762
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:32,797
&nbsp

763
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,997
I don't mean to snap at you.

764
00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:34,999
&nbsp

765
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:39,001
It just... I don't have
any options here, all right?

766
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:39,003
&nbsp

767
00:15:39,013 --> 00:15:41,337
Unless, of course, I appeal for

768
00:15:41,347 --> 00:15:41,339
&nbsp

769
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:42,672
trial by combat.

770
00:15:42,682 --> 00:15:44,842
&nbsp

771
00:15:44,852 --> 00:15:48,644
Guys, Gypsy's here.

772
00:15:48,654 --> 00:15:48,646
&nbsp

773
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,746
Always so punctual.

774
00:15:50,756 --> 00:16:01,659
&nbsp

775
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,559
I'm impressed!

776
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:03,561
&nbsp

777
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:05,227
Thought you'd try and flee again.

778
00:16:05,237 --> 00:16:05,229
&nbsp

779
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:06,529
Time to go.

780
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:08,132
&nbsp

781
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:09,699
All right.

782
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:09,701
&nbsp

783
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:13,135
Gypsy,

784
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:13,137
&nbsp

785
00:16:13,147 --> 00:16:14,704
take me home.

786
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:14,706
&nbsp

787
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:16,706
Wait.

788
00:16:16,716 --> 00:16:16,708
&nbsp

789
00:16:16,718 --> 00:16:18,307
You're not taking him anywhere.

790
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:18,309
&nbsp

791
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:20,776
- What?
- Why not?

792
00:16:20,786 --> 00:16:20,778
&nbsp

793
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:23,012
Because I challenge you to trial by combat.

794
00:16:23,022 --> 00:16:23,014
&nbsp

795
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,447
What are you doing?

796
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:24,449
&nbsp

797
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:25,848
I'm challenging her to trial by combat.

798
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:25,850
&nbsp

799
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,149
No, no, he isn't.

800
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:27,151
&nbsp

801
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:28,684
Okay, I am. I'm gonna fight you.

802
00:16:28,694 --> 00:16:28,686
&nbsp

803
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,086
Well, that one spoke first.

804
00:16:30,096 --> 00:16:30,088
&nbsp

805
00:16:30,098 --> 00:16:31,620
What? That's like a real rule?

806
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:31,622
&nbsp

807
00:16:31,632 --> 00:16:34,757
By the laws of Earth-19,
I hereby challenge you

808
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:34,759
&nbsp

809
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:37,493
for possession of H.R. Wells.

810
00:16:37,503 --> 00:16:37,495
&nbsp

811
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:39,462
If you want, we can solve this another way.

812
00:16:39,472 --> 00:16:39,464
&nbsp

813
00:16:39,474 --> 00:16:41,097
There's a great spot for drinks...

814
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:41,099
&nbsp

815
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:43,132
You realize trial by combat is to the death?

816
00:16:43,142 --> 00:16:43,134
&nbsp

817
00:16:43,144 --> 00:16:45,868
Yeah. For the loser.

818
00:16:45,878 --> 00:16:45,870
&nbsp

819
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,938
Listen, you want him?

820
00:16:48,948 --> 00:16:48,940
&nbsp

821
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,606
You're gonna have to come and claim him.

822
00:16:50,616 --> 00:16:50,608
&nbsp

823
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:52,208
Hmm.

824
00:16:52,218 --> 00:16:52,210
&nbsp

825
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,777
That's Arwen. That's... Arwen.

826
00:16:54,787 --> 00:16:54,779
&nbsp

827
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:57,313
I take it you also want the
customary 24 hours to prepare?

828
00:16:57,323 --> 00:16:57,315
&nbsp

829
00:16:57,325 --> 00:16:58,848
Do I want the customary...

830
00:16:58,858 --> 00:16:58,850
&nbsp

831
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,016
Yes, you do.

832
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:00,018
&nbsp

833
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:01,650
I would love to take advantage

834
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:01,652
&nbsp

835
00:17:01,662 --> 00:17:05,254
of the customary 24 hours,
if you don't mind.

836
00:17:05,264 --> 00:17:05,256
&nbsp

837
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:06,389
Very well.

838
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:06,391
&nbsp

839
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,923
One day.

840
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:07,925
&nbsp

841
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:10,126
One day.

842
00:17:10,136 --> 00:17:10,128
&nbsp

843
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:12,561
See you then.

844
00:17:12,571 --> 00:17:19,370
&nbsp

845
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,004
She's gonna kill me, isn't she?

846
00:17:22,014 --> 00:17:29,516
&nbsp

847
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:30,816
She's good.

848
00:17:30,826 --> 00:17:30,818
&nbsp

849
00:17:30,828 --> 00:17:32,217
She's great.

850
00:17:32,227 --> 00:17:32,219
&nbsp

851
00:17:32,229 --> 00:17:35,020
I mean, Gypsy is a legend on my Earth.

852
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,022
&nbsp

853
00:17:35,032 --> 00:17:36,855
So why, exactly, did you agree to fight her?

854
00:17:36,865 --> 00:17:36,857
&nbsp

855
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:37,923
I don't know.

856
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:37,947
&nbsp

857
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,413
You did what any of us would have done.

858
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:39,415
&nbsp

859
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,448
I might not have done it, just being honest.

860
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:41,450
&nbsp

861
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,050
Okay, all right. Lay it out for me.

862
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,052
&nbsp

863
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,485
What are my chances here,
scale of one to ten?

864
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:44,487
&nbsp

865
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:45,686
She's gonna kill you.

866
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:45,688
&nbsp

867
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,087
It's a pretty solid "one, " mate.

868
00:17:47,097 --> 00:17:47,089
&nbsp

869
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,923
You have the same powers Gypsy does, right?

870
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:48,925
&nbsp

871
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,691
I mean, she's not doing
anything you can't do.

872
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:50,693
&nbsp

873
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,893
Much better... look, I mean,
she's doing it just much better.

874
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:52,895
&nbsp

875
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,495
You can do this, okay?

876
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:54,497
&nbsp

877
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,196
You just need a little practice
and a little confidence.

878
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:56,198
&nbsp

879
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,598
And we're all gonna
help you with that, right?

880
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:57,600
&nbsp

881
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,832
- Yes.
- Uh, sure, sure, yeah.

882
00:17:58,842 --> 00:17:58,834
&nbsp

883
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,134
- Yes.
- Yeah.

884
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:00,136
&nbsp

885
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,735
Hey.

886
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:01,737
&nbsp

887
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,737
I believe in you, all right?

888
00:18:03,747 --> 00:18:03,739
&nbsp

889
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,005
You can beat her.

890
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:07,343
&nbsp

891
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:08,709
Listen, I have some ideas

892
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:08,711
&nbsp

893
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,044
for a training regimen I can set up in here.

894
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:10,046
&nbsp

895
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,312
Caitlin, why don't you get

896
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:11,314
&nbsp

897
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:12,580
the medical bay prepared in the meantime?

898
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:12,582
&nbsp

899
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,814
What? Well, why does... why does she

900
00:18:13,824 --> 00:18:13,816
&nbsp

901
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:14,982
need to set up the... the medical bay?

902
00:18:14,992 --> 00:18:14,984
&nbsp

903
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,550
For when you...

904
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:16,552
&nbsp

905
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,185
beat her, when you beat her,

906
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:18,187
&nbsp

907
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,620
she's gonna... she's gonna
need medical attention.

908
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:19,622
&nbsp

909
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:20,988
'Cause you will beat her, I have every faith

910
00:18:20,998 --> 00:18:20,990
&nbsp

911
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,191
that you're going to beat her.

912
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:24,193
&nbsp

913
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,859
We need to work on
your interpersonal skills.

914
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:25,861
&nbsp

915
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,828
I was really trying.

916
00:18:27,838 --> 00:18:27,830
&nbsp

917
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,863
Has anyone ever beat her?

918
00:18:29,873 --> 00:18:29,865
&nbsp

919
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,231
Yeah.

920
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:31,233
&nbsp

921
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,800
No.

922
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:32,802
&nbsp

923
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,602
Oh, okay.

924
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:34,604
&nbsp

925
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,904
Well, I've officially reached
a nice, comfortable level

926
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:36,906
&nbsp

927
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,739
of just straight-up panic.

928
00:18:38,749 --> 00:18:38,741
&nbsp

929
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,307
I mean, you don't even like me.

930
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:40,309
&nbsp

931
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,409
Why would you risk your life for me?

932
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:42,411
&nbsp

933
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,845
Well, you heard Barry.
It's what we do around here.

934
00:18:44,855 --> 00:18:44,847
&nbsp

935
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,714
Come on. Why?

936
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:46,716
&nbsp

937
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,082
You're not like the other Wellses.

938
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:48,084
&nbsp

939
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,483
Yeah, so you keep reminding me.

940
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:49,485
&nbsp

941
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,352
No, I mean, those two, they were geniuses.

942
00:18:51,362 --> 00:18:51,354
&nbsp

943
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:52,553
We depended on them.

944
00:18:52,563 --> 00:18:52,555
&nbsp

945
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,421
But with you, the roles are reversed.

946
00:18:54,431 --> 00:18:54,423
&nbsp

947
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:57,091
You depend on us.

948
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:57,093
&nbsp

949
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,892
Harrison Wells was always there for me,

950
00:18:58,902 --> 00:18:58,894
&nbsp

951
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,862
so I guess in some weird way, I just...

952
00:19:01,872 --> 00:19:01,864
&nbsp

953
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,530
I want to be there for Harrison Wells.

954
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,136
&nbsp

955
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,602
- Anyway...
- Yeah.

956
00:19:08,612 --> 00:19:14,744
&nbsp

957
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,443
So what are we doing here?

958
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:16,445
&nbsp

959
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,711
I thought you didn't want Dad to know

960
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:17,713
&nbsp

961
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,113
we're going after this arms dealer.

962
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:19,115
&nbsp

963
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,347
Oh, yeah, no, I don't.

964
00:19:20,357 --> 00:19:20,349
&nbsp

965
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,882
But, um, actually,

966
00:19:21,892 --> 00:19:21,884
&nbsp

967
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,651
I need you to swipe his file on the case

968
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:23,653
&nbsp

969
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,419
and photograph the pages
and then put them back.

970
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:25,421
&nbsp

971
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:26,587
Thanks.

972
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:26,589
&nbsp

973
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,788
What?

974
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:27,790
&nbsp

975
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,289
Iris.

976
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:29,291
&nbsp

977
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,858
Have you lost your mind?

978
00:19:30,868 --> 00:19:30,860
&nbsp

979
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,259
Dad will kill us.

980
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:32,261
&nbsp

981
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,261
No, no, Wally, he won't.

982
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,263
&nbsp

983
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,063
He won't even know that Kid Flash was there.

984
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:36,065
&nbsp

985
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,965
First, you have to tell me why.

986
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:37,967
&nbsp

987
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,199
Okay, look.

988
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:39,201
&nbsp

989
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,968
I know everyone is working really hard

990
00:19:40,978 --> 00:19:40,970
&nbsp

991
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,636
to prevent Savitar from...

992
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:42,638
&nbsp

993
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,371
Yeah.

994
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:44,373
&nbsp

995
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,041
But, honestly, these could be
my last few months on Earth.

996
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:47,043
&nbsp

997
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,308
Can you not talk like that?

998
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:48,310
&nbsp

999
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,810
I'm just being realistic, Wally.

1000
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:49,812
&nbsp

1001
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,745
I get to do that.

1002
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:51,747
&nbsp

1003
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,281
Look, I want my life to mean something,

1004
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:54,283
&nbsp

1005
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,183
more than just a daughter or as a sister

1006
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:56,185
&nbsp

1007
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,518
or as a girlfriend,

1008
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:57,520
&nbsp

1009
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,486
but as a reporter.

1010
00:19:59,496 --> 00:19:59,488
&nbsp

1011
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,754
This story can do that.

1012
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:00,756
&nbsp

1013
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,457
It can say that I, Iris West, mattered.

1014
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:03,459
&nbsp

1015
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,225
You know, my life was a lot easier

1016
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:05,227
&nbsp

1017
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,061
before I had a sister.

1018
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:07,063
&nbsp

1019
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,630
But it's a lot better now, isn't it?

1020
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:09,632
&nbsp

1021
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:11,265
Come on.

1022
00:20:11,275 --> 00:20:11,267
&nbsp

1023
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:12,833
Okay.

1024
00:20:12,843 --> 00:20:12,835
&nbsp

1025
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,768
I can get you the no-knock warrant,

1026
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:14,770
&nbsp

1027
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,437
but, Joe, this guy is armed to the teeth

1028
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:16,439
&nbsp

1029
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,172
with God only knows what.

1030
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:18,174
&nbsp

1031
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:19,740
You're gonna have to move
in there fast and hard.

1032
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,544
&nbsp

1033
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,010
"Fast and hard, " okay,
I kind of walked into that...

1034
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,012
&nbsp

1035
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,044
Hey. Sorry.

1036
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:24,046
&nbsp

1037
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,446
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hi.

1038
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:25,448
&nbsp

1039
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,947
Hi, Iris.

1040
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:26,949
&nbsp

1041
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,716
Hi. Good to see you, Cecile.

1042
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:28,718
&nbsp

1043
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,385
Um, Dad, can I borrow you for a second

1044
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:31,387
&nbsp

1045
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,520
for a little father-daughter talk?

1046
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:33,522
&nbsp

1047
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,488
Uh...

1048
00:20:34,498 --> 00:20:34,490
&nbsp

1049
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,556
I need to go

1050
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:35,558
&nbsp

1051
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,890
catch up with Captain Singh,

1052
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:36,892
&nbsp

1053
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,592
so I will be back in a little while, yeah?

1054
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:38,594
&nbsp

1055
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,095
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

1056
00:20:41,105 --> 00:20:41,097
&nbsp

1057
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,030
So... what's up? How can I help you?

1058
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,032
&nbsp

1059
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,698
Can I talk to you for a second over here?

1060
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:44,700
&nbsp

1061
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,502
Um...

1062
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:48,504
&nbsp

1063
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,537
Uhh, yeah, so, um,

1064
00:20:50,547 --> 00:20:50,539
&nbsp

1065
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,207
I wanted to... to speak to you about

1066
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:53,209
&nbsp

1067
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,008
me and Barry.

1068
00:20:55,018 --> 00:20:55,010
&nbsp

1069
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,176
You and Barry?

1070
00:20:56,186 --> 00:20:56,178
&nbsp

1071
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,945
- Yes.
- Okay?

1072
00:20:57,955 --> 00:20:57,947
&nbsp

1073
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,514
So there comes a time
in every couple's relationship

1074
00:21:00,524 --> 00:21:00,516
&nbsp

1075
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:02,983
when you realize that there is

1076
00:21:02,993 --> 00:21:02,985
&nbsp

1077
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,253
too much love for two people.

1078
00:21:06,263 --> 00:21:06,255
&nbsp

1079
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,688
And...

1080
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:07,690
&nbsp

1081
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,224
Uh, when that happens,
you know in your heart

1082
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:10,226
&nbsp

1083
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,526
that the only solution is

1084
00:21:12,536 --> 00:21:12,528
&nbsp

1085
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:16,130
to make your family a little... bigger.

1086
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,132
&nbsp

1087
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,531
- Okay, I'm gonna need a second.
- Oh!

1088
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:17,533
&nbsp

1089
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,032
Dad, hey, hey, listen to me very closely.

1090
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:19,034
&nbsp

1091
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,300
This is so important to me.

1092
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,302
&nbsp

1093
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,935
Oh, God.

1094
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:21,937
&nbsp

1095
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,937
Um...

1096
00:21:23,947 --> 00:21:23,939
&nbsp

1097
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,206
Um...

1098
00:21:26,216 --> 00:21:26,208
&nbsp

1099
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,742
Is Barry a dog or a cat person?

1100
00:21:28,752 --> 00:21:28,744
&nbsp

1101
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,077
What?

1102
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:30,079
&nbsp

1103
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,512
Yeah, what kind of animal does he like?

1104
00:21:31,522 --> 00:21:31,514
&nbsp

1105
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:33,147
Because I was thinking
about getting him a pet

1106
00:21:33,157 --> 00:21:33,149
&nbsp

1107
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,748
and I don't really remember
him having a preference.

1108
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:34,750
&nbsp

1109
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,683
Oh, man, you had me
going there for a second.

1110
00:21:36,693 --> 00:21:36,685
&nbsp

1111
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,018
What, what did you
think I was talking about?

1112
00:21:38,028 --> 00:21:38,020
&nbsp

1113
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,453
Nothing, nothing, I...

1114
00:21:39,463 --> 00:21:39,455
&nbsp

1115
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,721
you can get him any kind of animal you want

1116
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:40,723
&nbsp

1117
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,023
as long as it has four legs.

1118
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:43,025
&nbsp

1119
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,692
Good, great advice, four legs, copy that.

1120
00:21:45,702 --> 00:21:45,694
&nbsp

1121
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,529
Thanks for the chat. Okay, bye.

1122
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,399
&nbsp

1123
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,899
Damn.

1124
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:54,370
&nbsp

1125
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,036
Oh, yeah.

1126
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:56,038
&nbsp

1127
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,539
Facing the wrong way again.
How many is that?

1128
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:58,541
&nbsp

1129
00:21:58,551 --> 00:21:59,673
- Three.
- Nine.

1130
00:21:59,683 --> 00:21:59,675
&nbsp

1131
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,175
- You'll get there.
- Yes.

1132
00:22:01,185 --> 00:22:01,177
&nbsp

1133
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:03,110
Hopefully in the next
21 hours and 46 minutes.

1134
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,112
&nbsp

1135
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,945
All right, look, whenever I'm out there,

1136
00:22:04,955 --> 00:22:04,947
&nbsp

1137
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,713
I'm in a tough fight,
I think maybe I don't have it,

1138
00:22:06,723 --> 00:22:06,715
&nbsp

1139
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,315
I just take a deep breath...

1140
00:22:08,325 --> 00:22:08,317
&nbsp

1141
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,450
Trust my instincts.

1142
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:10,452
&nbsp

1143
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,319
Trust my instincts, that's good.

1144
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:12,321
&nbsp

1145
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,821
That helps.

1146
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:19,728
&nbsp

1147
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,795
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

1148
00:22:21,805 --> 00:22:24,834
&nbsp

1149
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,834
Guys?

1150
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:26,836
&nbsp

1151
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,870
Up here.

1152
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:29,872
&nbsp

1153
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:32,573
- Let... let's go talk.
- All right.

1154
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,043
&nbsp

1155
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,509
We can't let Francisco fight Gypsy,

1156
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:35,511
&nbsp

1157
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,211
because if he does, he is a dead man.

1158
00:22:37,221 --> 00:22:37,213
&nbsp

1159
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:38,579
- You don't know that.
- Oh, I know that.

1160
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:38,581
&nbsp

1161
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:39,913
You know that. He knows that.

1162
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:39,915
&nbsp

1163
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,782
- Okay, I get it.
- She knows that.

1164
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:41,784
&nbsp

1165
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,584
- We know that; everybody knows...
- So what are we supposed to do?

1166
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:43,586
&nbsp

1167
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:45,419
We're supposed to stop her
before she fights him.

1168
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:45,421
&nbsp

1169
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:47,020
That would be great
if we knew where she was.

1170
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,022
&nbsp

1171
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,156
- Yes?
- I know where she is.

1172
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:49,158
&nbsp

1173
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:51,458
- How?
- I tagged her with a tracer

1174
00:22:51,468 --> 00:22:51,460
&nbsp

1175
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,759
last time she was here.

1176
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:52,761
&nbsp

1177
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:53,994
A magician friend told me you kind of

1178
00:22:54,004 --> 00:22:53,996
&nbsp

1179
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,262
- distract 'em and tag...
- H.R.

1180
00:22:55,272 --> 00:22:55,264
&nbsp

1181
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,663
I needed to know where she was

1182
00:22:56,673 --> 00:22:56,665
&nbsp

1183
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,131
so I could stay one step ahead of her.

1184
00:22:58,141 --> 00:22:58,133
&nbsp

1185
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,033
She is...

1186
00:23:00,043 --> 00:23:01,770
&nbsp

1187
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,604
- At the waterfront.
- At the waterfront.

1188
00:23:03,614 --> 00:23:03,606
&nbsp

1189
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:06,506
What do you say? For Francisco?

1190
00:23:06,516 --> 00:23:06,508
&nbsp

1191
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,075
All right.

1192
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:15,618
&nbsp

1193
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,551
This world may be a primitive,

1194
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:17,553
&nbsp

1195
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,419
uncultured backwater,

1196
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:19,421
&nbsp

1197
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,623
but they do make an excellent cup of coffee.

1198
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:22,625
&nbsp

1199
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:24,358
That they do. You know what you gotta try?

1200
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:24,360
&nbsp

1201
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,027
You gotta try the Brazilian roast, it's new.

1202
00:23:27,037 --> 00:23:27,029
&nbsp

1203
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,096
It is so good.

1204
00:23:29,106 --> 00:23:29,098
&nbsp

1205
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:30,664
Maybe I'll take a few bags back with me.

1206
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:30,666
&nbsp

1207
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:32,032
Yeah, think that's wise.

1208
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:32,034
&nbsp

1209
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:33,433
Will you be going back in a bag?

1210
00:23:33,443 --> 00:23:33,435
&nbsp

1211
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,536
Look, that kid, Francisco,

1212
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:36,538
&nbsp

1213
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,038
he's just trying to protect me.

1214
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:38,040
&nbsp

1215
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,307
Then he's as foolish as he is cute.

1216
00:23:40,317 --> 00:23:40,309
&nbsp

1217
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,777
Okay, Gypsy.

1218
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:43,779
&nbsp

1219
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:44,845
Let's go home.

1220
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:47,850
&nbsp

1221
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,882
B.A.!

1222
00:23:48,892 --> 00:23:48,884
&nbsp

1223
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,784
Nice try!

1224
00:23:50,794 --> 00:23:50,786
&nbsp

1225
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:51,885
You think I didn't see that coming?

1226
00:23:51,895 --> 00:23:51,887
&nbsp

1227
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:52,819
Stop, stop!

1228
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:52,821
&nbsp

1229
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,087
- Stop what?
- Stop...

1230
00:23:54,097 --> 00:23:54,089
&nbsp

1231
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,489
Stop trying to enforce the law?

1232
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:55,491
&nbsp

1233
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,291
You are a criminal.

1234
00:23:57,301 --> 00:23:57,293
&nbsp

1235
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:58,959
Now, it's great that you made friends here,

1236
00:23:58,969 --> 00:23:58,961
&nbsp

1237
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,994
but that doesn't change
the fact that you lied.

1238
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:00,996
&nbsp

1239
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,463
You broke our most sacred laws,

1240
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:03,465
&nbsp

1241
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,700
and now it is time for you to face justice.

1242
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:06,702
&nbsp

1243
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:08,402
Wait!

1244
00:24:08,412 --> 00:24:08,404
&nbsp

1245
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:09,970
You still need to face Cisco.

1246
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:09,972
&nbsp

1247
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,139
No, I think this
little stunt forfeits his claim.

1248
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:12,141
&nbsp

1249
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:13,640
And his time.

1250
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:13,642
&nbsp

1251
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:14,975
You just said you believe in the law, right?

1252
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:14,977
&nbsp

1253
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,276
We made a mistake.

1254
00:24:16,286 --> 00:24:16,278
&nbsp

1255
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,011
Cisco will hold up his end of the deal.

1256
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:18,013
&nbsp

1257
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,546
He will.

1258
00:24:19,556 --> 00:24:19,548
&nbsp

1259
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:22,549
You have really pulled
a number on these people

1260
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:22,551
&nbsp

1261
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,952
if they would die for you.

1262
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:24,954
&nbsp

1263
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,753
Tell Cisco there is no backing out now.

1264
00:24:26,763 --> 00:24:26,755
&nbsp

1265
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:30,223
I'll keep this one as insurance until then.

1266
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:30,225
&nbsp

1267
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:31,892
B.A...

1268
00:24:31,902 --> 00:24:31,894
&nbsp

1269
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,994
That's not good.

1270
00:24:34,004 --> 00:24:44,270
&nbsp

1271
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,638
- She took H.R.?
- Mm-hmm.

1272
00:24:47,648 --> 00:24:47,640
&nbsp

1273
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,373
Can she do that?

1274
00:24:49,383 --> 00:24:49,375
&nbsp

1275
00:24:49,385 --> 00:24:51,709
I mean, I though this whole
trial by combat thing had rules.

1276
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:51,711
&nbsp

1277
00:24:51,721 --> 00:24:53,143
Which apparently we broke

1278
00:24:53,153 --> 00:24:53,145
&nbsp

1279
00:24:53,155 --> 00:24:54,578
when we tried to get the drop on her.

1280
00:24:54,588 --> 00:24:54,580
&nbsp

1281
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,381
Well, that wasn't very clever, was it?

1282
00:24:57,391 --> 00:24:57,383
&nbsp

1283
00:24:57,393 --> 00:24:59,216
A deal's a deal. It should be honored.

1284
00:24:59,226 --> 00:24:59,218
&nbsp

1285
00:24:59,228 --> 00:25:01,118
You know what? You're right, Julian.

1286
00:25:01,128 --> 00:25:01,120
&nbsp

1287
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,353
A deal is a deal.

1288
00:25:02,363 --> 00:25:02,355
&nbsp

1289
00:25:02,365 --> 00:25:04,221
And our deal was that I would train

1290
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:04,223
&nbsp

1291
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:06,257
so that I could fight Gypsy,
but I guess you two

1292
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:06,259
&nbsp

1293
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:08,158
wanted to go behind my back
and try to sub in?

1294
00:25:08,168 --> 00:25:08,160
&nbsp

1295
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,661
We didn't go... we just thought
maybe you could use some help.

1296
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:10,663
&nbsp

1297
00:25:10,673 --> 00:25:12,630
Yeah? What happened to,
"Cisco, you can beat her"?

1298
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:12,632
&nbsp

1299
00:25:12,642 --> 00:25:14,632
- You can.
- "I believe in you."

1300
00:25:14,642 --> 00:25:14,634
&nbsp

1301
00:25:14,644 --> 00:25:16,900
- I do.
- "Trust your instincts."

1302
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:21,707
&nbsp

1303
00:25:21,717 --> 00:25:23,207
Well, right now,

1304
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:23,209
&nbsp

1305
00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:24,708
my instincts are telling me
I should be writing

1306
00:25:24,718 --> 00:25:24,710
&nbsp

1307
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,710
my last will and testament,
so please excuse me.

1308
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:26,712
&nbsp

1309
00:25:26,722 --> 00:25:29,580
Cisco, come...

1310
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:29,582
&nbsp

1311
00:25:29,592 --> 00:25:30,948
Should I go talk to him?

1312
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:30,950
&nbsp

1313
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,750
No, I...

1314
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:32,752
&nbsp

1315
00:25:32,762 --> 00:25:34,084
I got it.

1316
00:25:34,094 --> 00:25:36,222
&nbsp

1317
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:37,621
Looks like I'm not the only one

1318
00:25:37,631 --> 00:25:37,623
&nbsp

1319
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:39,790
who has to work on
their interpersonal skills.

1320
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,864
&nbsp

1321
00:25:44,874 --> 00:25:46,030
Oh, hey.

1322
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,032
&nbsp

1323
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:47,765
I'd be careful if I were you.

1324
00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:47,767
&nbsp

1325
00:25:47,777 --> 00:25:49,533
Last thing we want is
for me to touch a button

1326
00:25:49,543 --> 00:25:49,535
&nbsp

1327
00:25:49,545 --> 00:25:51,201
and blow your head off, right?

1328
00:25:51,211 --> 00:25:51,203
&nbsp

1329
00:25:51,213 --> 00:25:52,970
'Cause I don't know what I'm doing, right?

1330
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:52,972
&nbsp

1331
00:25:52,982 --> 00:25:54,271
You know I don't think that.

1332
00:25:54,281 --> 00:25:54,273
&nbsp

1333
00:25:54,283 --> 00:25:55,873
Yeah, well, you have a very,

1334
00:25:55,883 --> 00:25:55,875
&nbsp

1335
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:57,808
very strange way of showing it.

1336
00:25:57,818 --> 00:26:00,613
&nbsp

1337
00:26:00,623 --> 00:26:02,179
You're right, man. I'm sorry.

1338
00:26:02,189 --> 00:26:02,181
&nbsp

1339
00:26:02,191 --> 00:26:04,148
I don't know. I just...

1340
00:26:04,158 --> 00:26:04,150
&nbsp

1341
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,650
guess this whole "not getting faster" thing,

1342
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:06,652
&nbsp

1343
00:26:06,662 --> 00:26:09,887
it just has me rattled.

1344
00:26:09,897 --> 00:26:09,889
&nbsp

1345
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:12,089
I was always able to do it before, you know?

1346
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:12,091
&nbsp

1347
00:26:12,101 --> 00:26:15,926
I mean, against Reverse Flash
and then against Zoom, but...

1348
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:15,928
&nbsp

1349
00:26:15,938 --> 00:26:19,430
Savitar's on a whole other level.

1350
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:19,432
&nbsp

1351
00:26:19,442 --> 00:26:23,667
And knowing what he'll do to Iris if I fail?

1352
00:26:23,677 --> 00:26:23,669
&nbsp

1353
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,769
I'm afraid just...

1354
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:25,771
&nbsp

1355
00:26:25,781 --> 00:26:29,340
thinking what's gonna happen
to H.R. if I don't beat Gypsy.

1356
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:29,342
&nbsp

1357
00:26:29,352 --> 00:26:32,076
But you, you're the hero. I mean,

1358
00:26:32,086 --> 00:26:32,078
&nbsp

1359
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:35,946
how do you handle
all this pressure all the time?

1360
00:26:35,956 --> 00:26:35,948
&nbsp

1361
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:38,082
By just leaning on all of you guys.

1362
00:26:38,092 --> 00:26:38,084
&nbsp

1363
00:26:38,094 --> 00:26:39,917
You know, I mean,
you're always in my corner,

1364
00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:39,919
&nbsp

1365
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:41,752
helping me face my fears.

1366
00:26:41,762 --> 00:26:41,754
&nbsp

1367
00:26:41,764 --> 00:26:45,122
And it is okay to be afraid. Trust me.

1368
00:26:45,132 --> 00:26:45,124
&nbsp

1369
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:47,257
And when you are, I'll be there

1370
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:47,259
&nbsp

1371
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:50,094
in your corner.

1372
00:26:50,104 --> 00:26:50,096
&nbsp

1373
00:26:50,106 --> 00:26:52,096
Yes, lovely little speech, Allen.

1374
00:26:52,106 --> 00:26:52,098
&nbsp

1375
00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:54,164
But what Mr. Ramon needs to defeat

1376
00:26:54,174 --> 00:26:54,166
&nbsp

1377
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:56,500
his inter-dimensional adversary

1378
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:56,502
&nbsp

1379
00:26:56,512 --> 00:26:57,835
is a practical stratagem.

1380
00:26:57,845 --> 00:26:57,837
&nbsp

1381
00:26:57,847 --> 00:26:59,803
Lucky for you, I found one.

1382
00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:01,173
&nbsp

1383
00:27:01,183 --> 00:27:02,506
This is Gypsy's signature move.

1384
00:27:02,516 --> 00:27:02,508
&nbsp

1385
00:27:02,518 --> 00:27:03,974
I call it her "breach and blast"

1386
00:27:03,984 --> 00:27:03,976
&nbsp

1387
00:27:03,986 --> 00:27:06,176
Oh, yeah. That move.

1388
00:27:06,186 --> 00:27:06,178
&nbsp

1389
00:27:06,188 --> 00:27:08,245
You see just before she comes
in and out of a breach,

1390
00:27:08,255 --> 00:27:08,247
&nbsp

1391
00:27:08,257 --> 00:27:10,080
her feet come off the ground.

1392
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:10,082
&nbsp

1393
00:27:10,092 --> 00:27:11,815
So for that split second
she's off the ground,

1394
00:27:11,825 --> 00:27:11,817
&nbsp

1395
00:27:11,827 --> 00:27:12,950
she'll be off-balance.

1396
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:12,952
&nbsp

1397
00:27:12,962 --> 00:27:14,818
Yes, and vulnerable.

1398
00:27:14,828 --> 00:27:14,820
&nbsp

1399
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,820
It might behoove you
to use this during the battle.

1400
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:16,822
&nbsp

1401
00:27:16,832 --> 00:27:18,956
This is great, Julian.

1402
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:18,958
&nbsp

1403
00:27:18,968 --> 00:27:20,557
Hmm, just glad I could be helpful.

1404
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:20,559
&nbsp

1405
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:23,594
This is... more than helpful.
I gotta work on this.

1406
00:27:23,604 --> 00:27:23,596
&nbsp

1407
00:27:23,606 --> 00:27:26,063
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

1408
00:27:26,073 --> 00:27:26,065
&nbsp

1409
00:27:26,075 --> 00:27:27,297
Thanks.

1410
00:27:27,307 --> 00:27:34,440
&nbsp

1411
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,906
You sure this is the place?

1412
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:35,908
&nbsp

1413
00:27:35,918 --> 00:27:37,174
- Positive.
- All right.

1414
00:27:37,184 --> 00:27:37,176
&nbsp

1415
00:27:37,186 --> 00:27:38,675
You ready to bust an arms dealer?

1416
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:38,677
&nbsp

1417
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:40,344
- Get me a front-page headline?
- Wally, wait.

1418
00:27:40,354 --> 00:27:40,346
&nbsp

1419
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:42,546
CCPD's been looking for this guy for months.

1420
00:27:42,556 --> 00:27:42,548
&nbsp

1421
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:44,515
He might have some sort
of secret tunnel network

1422
00:27:44,525 --> 00:27:44,517
&nbsp

1423
00:27:44,527 --> 00:27:46,183
that helps him slip out and get away.

1424
00:27:46,193 --> 00:27:46,185
&nbsp

1425
00:27:46,195 --> 00:27:47,684
I should do a quick recon.

1426
00:27:47,694 --> 00:27:47,686
&nbsp

1427
00:27:47,696 --> 00:27:48,919
Yeah. Thorough.

1428
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:48,921
&nbsp

1429
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:50,387
We don't want to miss anything, okay?

1430
00:27:50,397 --> 00:27:50,389
&nbsp

1431
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,889
Be back in a you-know-what.

1432
00:27:51,899 --> 00:28:29,562
&nbsp

1433
00:28:29,572 --> 00:28:31,261
Hope you like what you see,

1434
00:28:31,271 --> 00:28:31,263
&nbsp

1435
00:28:31,273 --> 00:28:35,199
'cause this sneak preview
is gonna cost you your life.

1436
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:35,201
&nbsp

1437
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:37,067
Yeah, I don't think so.

1438
00:28:37,077 --> 00:28:40,105
&nbsp

1439
00:28:40,115 --> 00:28:42,072
Are you crazy?

1440
00:28:42,082 --> 00:28:42,074
&nbsp

1441
00:28:42,084 --> 00:28:43,841
This'll rip a hole right through you.

1442
00:28:43,851 --> 00:28:43,843
&nbsp

1443
00:28:43,853 --> 00:28:46,410
Everyone's gotta go sometime, right?

1444
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:46,412
&nbsp

1445
00:28:46,422 --> 00:28:49,546
And I am pretty sure today just...

1446
00:28:49,556 --> 00:28:49,548
&nbsp

1447
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:50,747
isn't my day.

1448
00:28:50,757 --> 00:28:56,188
&nbsp

1449
00:28:56,198 --> 00:28:57,421
What the hell, sis?

1450
00:28:57,431 --> 00:28:57,423
&nbsp

1451
00:28:57,433 --> 00:28:58,922
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

1452
00:28:58,932 --> 00:28:58,924
&nbsp

1453
00:28:58,934 --> 00:29:00,591
God, okay, look,
we gotta get you out of here

1454
00:29:00,601 --> 00:29:00,593
&nbsp

1455
00:29:00,603 --> 00:29:02,259
before CCPD sees you.

1456
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:02,261
&nbsp

1457
00:29:02,271 --> 00:29:03,961
Don't worry.
Dad's, like, my biggest fan now.

1458
00:29:03,971 --> 00:29:03,963
&nbsp

1459
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:06,997
He's totally cool
with me doing stuff like this.

1460
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:08,467
&nbsp

1461
00:29:08,477 --> 00:29:10,100
Hell no, I ain't cool with this.

1462
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:10,102
&nbsp

1463
00:29:10,112 --> 00:29:14,004
You two almost compromised
a major CCPD sting operation

1464
00:29:14,014 --> 00:29:14,006
&nbsp

1465
00:29:14,016 --> 00:29:16,573
that took the DA's office
months to assemble.

1466
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:16,575
&nbsp

1467
00:29:16,585 --> 00:29:17,774
You still got the guy, right?

1468
00:29:17,784 --> 00:29:17,776
&nbsp

1469
00:29:17,786 --> 00:29:19,409
That is not the point, Iris.

1470
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:19,411
&nbsp

1471
00:29:19,421 --> 00:29:21,278
The point is, you had
you and your brother out there

1472
00:29:21,288 --> 00:29:21,280
&nbsp

1473
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,579
in danger, and for what?

1474
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:22,581
&nbsp

1475
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:24,915
A story? And where the hell were you?

1476
00:29:24,925 --> 00:29:24,917
&nbsp

1477
00:29:24,927 --> 00:29:27,017
Dad, this is more than just a story for me.

1478
00:29:27,027 --> 00:29:27,019
&nbsp

1479
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:28,452
Yeah, which you almost got shot for.

1480
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:29,922
&nbsp

1481
00:29:29,932 --> 00:29:31,154
Oh, God.

1482
00:29:31,164 --> 00:29:33,726
&nbsp

1483
00:29:33,736 --> 00:29:34,958
What?

1484
00:29:34,968 --> 00:29:34,960
&nbsp

1485
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,560
Iris.

1486
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:36,562
&nbsp

1487
00:29:36,572 --> 00:29:38,562
What is going on with you?

1488
00:29:38,572 --> 00:29:40,666
&nbsp

1489
00:29:40,676 --> 00:29:43,734
Joe, I'm sorry...
Can I talk to you for a second?

1490
00:29:43,744 --> 00:29:43,736
&nbsp

1491
00:29:43,746 --> 00:29:45,168
We'll be right back.

1492
00:29:45,178 --> 00:29:50,609
&nbsp

1493
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:52,276
Joe already suspects something's up.

1494
00:29:52,286 --> 00:29:52,278
&nbsp

1495
00:29:52,288 --> 00:29:54,077
You going out there like that,
it just hangs a bell on it.

1496
00:29:54,087 --> 00:29:54,079
&nbsp

1497
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:57,080
This story is going to change lives, Barry.

1498
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:57,082
&nbsp

1499
00:29:57,092 --> 00:29:58,916
Why do you think that you're the only one

1500
00:29:58,926 --> 00:29:58,918
&nbsp

1501
00:29:58,928 --> 00:30:01,018
allowed to risk your life to do good?

1502
00:30:01,028 --> 00:30:01,020
&nbsp

1503
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,119
I don't.

1504
00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:07,226
&nbsp

1505
00:30:07,236 --> 00:30:10,394
It's okay to be afraid of the future.

1506
00:30:10,404 --> 00:30:10,396
&nbsp

1507
00:30:10,406 --> 00:30:12,563
But I won't let you die.

1508
00:30:12,573 --> 00:30:12,565
&nbsp

1509
00:30:12,575 --> 00:30:16,199
I am not afraid to die, Barry, I'm not.

1510
00:30:16,209 --> 00:30:16,201
&nbsp

1511
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:17,901
Then what?

1512
00:30:17,911 --> 00:30:17,903
&nbsp

1513
00:30:17,913 --> 00:30:20,037
I'm afraid...

1514
00:30:20,047 --> 00:30:23,042
&nbsp

1515
00:30:23,052 --> 00:30:26,343
What if I end up just like my mom?

1516
00:30:26,353 --> 00:30:26,345
&nbsp

1517
00:30:26,355 --> 00:30:28,345
Just gone without making a mark,

1518
00:30:28,355 --> 00:30:28,347
&nbsp

1519
00:30:28,357 --> 00:30:30,414
without leaving anything behind.

1520
00:30:30,424 --> 00:30:30,416
&nbsp

1521
00:30:30,426 --> 00:30:33,550
Iris, your mom,

1522
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:33,552
&nbsp

1523
00:30:33,562 --> 00:30:36,086
she left something behind.

1524
00:30:36,096 --> 00:30:36,088
&nbsp

1525
00:30:36,098 --> 00:30:39,590
She left a brave, wonderful son

1526
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:39,592
&nbsp

1527
00:30:39,602 --> 00:30:42,225
and the woman that I love.

1528
00:30:42,235 --> 00:30:44,063
&nbsp

1529
00:30:44,073 --> 00:30:45,529
All right?

1530
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:47,666
&nbsp

1531
00:30:47,676 --> 00:30:50,133
I don't know what the future
holds, none of us do.

1532
00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:55,541
&nbsp

1533
00:30:55,551 --> 00:30:58,875
I know that we will face it together.

1534
00:30:58,885 --> 00:31:00,946
&nbsp

1535
00:31:00,956 --> 00:31:03,947
Gypsy just vibed me her location.

1536
00:31:03,957 --> 00:31:03,949
&nbsp

1537
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:05,749
Let's do this.

1538
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:07,720
&nbsp

1539
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:10,020
I don't think the
literary critics on our Earth

1540
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,022
&nbsp

1541
00:31:10,032 --> 00:31:13,557
would know a real sci-fi romance best seller

1542
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:13,559
&nbsp

1543
00:31:13,569 --> 00:31:16,526
- unless it bit them in the...
- Time's up, Wells.

1544
00:31:16,536 --> 00:31:16,528
&nbsp

1545
00:31:16,538 --> 00:31:19,463
Looks like your so-called
friend is a coward after all.

1546
00:31:19,473 --> 00:31:19,465
&nbsp

1547
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:21,198
He's not a coward.

1548
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:21,200
&nbsp

1549
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,400
He's one of the finest men I've ever known.

1550
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:23,402
&nbsp

1551
00:31:23,412 --> 00:31:26,169
Oh, you're right about that!

1552
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:26,171
&nbsp

1553
00:31:26,181 --> 00:31:27,704
I'm fine as hell.

1554
00:31:27,714 --> 00:31:27,706
&nbsp

1555
00:31:27,716 --> 00:31:29,439
There he is.

1556
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:29,441
&nbsp

1557
00:31:29,451 --> 00:31:30,941
Didn't think you'd show.

1558
00:31:30,951 --> 00:31:30,943
&nbsp

1559
00:31:30,953 --> 00:31:32,976
Oh, I wouldn't miss an evening with you,

1560
00:31:32,986 --> 00:31:32,978
&nbsp

1561
00:31:32,988 --> 00:31:34,544
even if it is for a showdown.

1562
00:31:34,554 --> 00:31:34,546
&nbsp

1563
00:31:34,556 --> 00:31:37,447
I will kill you, Cisco.

1564
00:31:37,457 --> 00:31:37,449
&nbsp

1565
00:31:37,459 --> 00:31:38,749
We'll see who dies tonight.

1566
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:40,786
&nbsp

1567
00:31:40,796 --> 00:31:42,853
To the victor goes H.R. Wells.

1568
00:31:42,863 --> 00:31:42,855
&nbsp

1569
00:31:42,865 --> 00:31:44,254
May the best vibe win.

1570
00:31:44,264 --> 00:31:50,974
&nbsp

1571
00:31:50,984 --> 00:31:52,541
Part of me was hoping
you wouldn't show tonight.

1572
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:53,420
&nbsp

1573
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,419
How do you want to do this?

1574
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:54,469
&nbsp

1575
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,102
"Westworld" style, back to back,
ten paces, turn and shoot?

1576
00:31:56,112 --> 00:31:56,104
&nbsp

1577
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,171
No.

1578
00:31:58,181 --> 00:32:02,179
&nbsp

1579
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:03,212
This does not bode well.

1580
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:03,263
&nbsp

1581
00:32:03,273 --> 00:32:04,496
Cisco can hold his own.

1582
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:04,498
&nbsp

1583
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:05,697
Hmm. Barely.

1584
00:32:05,707 --> 00:32:05,780
&nbsp

1585
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,979
Barry, we can't let this happen.

1586
00:32:06,989 --> 00:32:06,981
&nbsp

1587
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,114
What if he can't defeat her?

1588
00:32:08,124 --> 00:32:08,116
&nbsp

1589
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,582
I can't interfere again.

1590
00:32:09,592 --> 00:32:09,584
&nbsp

1591
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,184
If I do, then we forfeit. H.R.'s a dead man.

1592
00:32:11,194 --> 00:32:11,186
&nbsp

1593
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:12,952
At this rate, Cisco's gonna be the dead man.

1594
00:32:12,962 --> 00:32:12,954
&nbsp

1595
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,154
Oh.

1596
00:32:15,164 --> 00:32:15,156
&nbsp

1597
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,090
Ooh, girl!

1598
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,092
&nbsp

1599
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,425
You done did it now!

1600
00:32:19,435 --> 00:32:33,341
&nbsp

1601
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:34,674
Stronger than I thought.

1602
00:32:34,684 --> 00:32:34,676
&nbsp

1603
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,909
I'm just getting warmed up.

1604
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:36,911
&nbsp

1605
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,378
Yeah, maybe not do that.

1606
00:32:38,388 --> 00:32:38,380
&nbsp

1607
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,381
Time to turn things up to 11.

1608
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:41,383
&nbsp

1609
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:42,815
"Spinal Tap."

1610
00:32:42,825 --> 00:32:42,817
&nbsp

1611
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,550
That's, like, one of my favorite movies...

1612
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,990
&nbsp

1613
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,123
Where did they go?

1614
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:50,125
&nbsp

1615
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,791
I... they could be anywhere by now.

1616
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:51,793
&nbsp

1617
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,060
In any universe.

1618
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,498
&nbsp

1619
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:57,997
This is Earth-2.

1620
00:32:58,007 --> 00:32:59,701
&nbsp

1621
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,602
You're cute, but you talk too much.

1622
00:33:02,612 --> 00:33:02,604
&nbsp

1623
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,404
Oh, you want to play dirty, huh?

1624
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:04,406
&nbsp

1625
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,838
Let's play dirty.

1626
00:33:05,848 --> 00:33:17,452
&nbsp

1627
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:20,086
Oh! That hurts.

1628
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:20,088
&nbsp

1629
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,454
That too.

1630
00:33:21,464 --> 00:33:28,296
&nbsp

1631
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:31,030
Is it me, or is this city getting weirder?

1632
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:41,176
&nbsp

1633
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,775
Well, this is hot.

1634
00:33:42,785 --> 00:33:42,777
&nbsp

1635
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,210
I think you're flirting
with me to distract me

1636
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:44,212
&nbsp

1637
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,344
'cause you're afraid.

1638
00:33:45,354 --> 00:33:46,815
&nbsp

1639
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:49,048
My collection record is flawless.

1640
00:33:49,058 --> 00:33:49,050
&nbsp

1641
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,883
In these trials, I am undefeated.

1642
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:52,187
&nbsp

1643
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,653
Oh, please.

1644
00:33:53,663 --> 00:33:53,655
&nbsp

1645
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:56,489
Everybody's got a weakness.

1646
00:33:56,499 --> 00:33:56,491
&nbsp

1647
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:57,457
Even you.

1648
00:33:57,467 --> 00:34:02,464
&nbsp

1649
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:04,363
Says the man afraid of showing everyone

1650
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:04,365
&nbsp

1651
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,798
how powerful he can be.

1652
00:34:05,808 --> 00:34:05,800
&nbsp

1653
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,601
You and I resonate on a similar frequency.

1654
00:34:08,611 --> 00:34:08,603
&nbsp

1655
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,536
I can feel it.

1656
00:34:10,546 --> 00:34:10,538
&nbsp

1657
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,839
Yet you allow your fear
and insecurity to hold you back.

1658
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:12,841
&nbsp

1659
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:15,408
That's why you're gonna lose.

1660
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:30,058
&nbsp

1661
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,725
Does this look like holding back to you?

1662
00:34:32,735 --> 00:34:32,727
&nbsp

1663
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,228
- I could do this all night.
- How did you...

1664
00:34:35,238 --> 00:34:35,230
&nbsp

1665
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,097
You might want to work on
your balance next time, girl.

1666
00:34:38,107 --> 00:34:42,570
&nbsp

1667
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,437
Admit it,

1668
00:34:44,447 --> 00:34:44,439
&nbsp

1669
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,505
I won.

1670
00:34:45,515 --> 00:34:45,507
&nbsp

1671
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:46,873
- Yes!
- He won.

1672
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:46,875
&nbsp

1673
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:47,974
- Yeah, he did.
- He won.

1674
00:34:47,984 --> 00:34:47,976
&nbsp

1675
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:50,176
Yes!

1676
00:34:50,186 --> 00:34:50,178
&nbsp

1677
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,711
She must have been having an off day.

1678
00:34:51,721 --> 00:34:54,682
&nbsp

1679
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,549
- What?
- Wow.

1680
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:58,453
&nbsp

1681
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,386
By the laws of Earth-19,

1682
00:35:00,396 --> 00:35:00,388
&nbsp

1683
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:04,156
the prisoner is yours for the taking,

1684
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:04,158
&nbsp

1685
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,258
as is my life.

1686
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:05,260
&nbsp

1687
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,893
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1688
00:35:06,903 --> 00:35:06,895
&nbsp

1689
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:09,262
We don't roll like that around here.

1690
00:35:09,272 --> 00:35:09,264
&nbsp

1691
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,530
Come on.

1692
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:17,438
&nbsp

1693
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,106
In all the multiverse, I have...

1694
00:35:20,116 --> 00:35:20,108
&nbsp

1695
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,441
never...

1696
00:35:22,451 --> 00:35:22,443
&nbsp

1697
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,311
met anyone like you, Cisco.

1698
00:35:25,321 --> 00:35:25,313
&nbsp

1699
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:28,814
Please, call me Vibe.

1700
00:35:28,824 --> 00:35:28,816
&nbsp

1701
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,783
Or... or you can call me Cisco.

1702
00:35:30,793 --> 00:35:30,785
&nbsp

1703
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,184
That's also allowed.

1704
00:35:32,194 --> 00:35:32,186
&nbsp

1705
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,420
I'm just a regular guy.

1706
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:34,422
&nbsp

1707
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,489
Just a regular...

1708
00:35:36,499 --> 00:35:36,491
&nbsp

1709
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,324
single guy.

1710
00:35:38,334 --> 00:35:47,442
&nbsp

1711
00:35:47,452 --> 00:35:50,076
It says you're totally fine.

1712
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:50,078
&nbsp

1713
00:35:50,088 --> 00:35:53,112
So what happens now? Go back to your Earth?

1714
00:35:53,122 --> 00:35:53,114
&nbsp

1715
00:35:53,124 --> 00:35:55,248
Tell all your superiors
that you were bested in battle,

1716
00:35:55,258 --> 00:35:55,250
&nbsp

1717
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,383
all the charges against H.R. are dropped.

1718
00:35:57,393 --> 00:35:57,385
&nbsp

1719
00:35:57,395 --> 00:35:59,219
No.

1720
00:35:59,229 --> 00:35:59,221
&nbsp

1721
00:35:59,231 --> 00:36:00,887
I tell them I killed him.

1722
00:36:00,897 --> 00:36:00,889
&nbsp

1723
00:36:00,899 --> 00:36:02,455
Wait, what?

1724
00:36:02,465 --> 00:36:02,457
&nbsp

1725
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:04,691
If I return empty-handed,
they'll know I failed.

1726
00:36:04,701 --> 00:36:04,693
&nbsp

1727
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:06,159
And I never fail.

1728
00:36:06,169 --> 00:36:06,161
&nbsp

1729
00:36:06,171 --> 00:36:07,894
Until today.

1730
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:07,896
&nbsp

1731
00:36:07,906 --> 00:36:09,462
Okay, but if you

1732
00:36:09,472 --> 00:36:09,464
&nbsp

1733
00:36:09,474 --> 00:36:11,664
tell them that you killed me, then I...

1734
00:36:11,674 --> 00:36:11,666
&nbsp

1735
00:36:11,676 --> 00:36:13,866
You will never go back to Earth-19,

1736
00:36:13,876 --> 00:36:13,868
&nbsp

1737
00:36:13,878 --> 00:36:16,869
ever.

1738
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:16,871
&nbsp

1739
00:36:16,881 --> 00:36:19,138
Do we have a deal?

1740
00:36:19,148 --> 00:36:19,140
&nbsp

1741
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,773
Yeah. I guess we have a deal.

1742
00:36:20,783 --> 00:36:20,775
&nbsp

1743
00:36:20,785 --> 00:36:22,442
I don't really have anything to go home for.

1744
00:36:22,452 --> 00:36:22,444
&nbsp

1745
00:36:22,454 --> 00:36:24,711
You'll always have a home here, H.R.

1746
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:31,052
&nbsp

1747
00:36:31,062 --> 00:36:33,553
Listen, I know there's
no coffee on your Earth

1748
00:36:33,563 --> 00:36:33,555
&nbsp

1749
00:36:33,565 --> 00:36:35,355
'cause of the whole
Blight thing or whatever,

1750
00:36:35,365 --> 00:36:35,357
&nbsp

1751
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:37,223
but this... this is just an absurd

1752
00:36:37,233 --> 00:36:37,225
&nbsp

1753
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:40,393
amount of coffee you're
bringing back to your Earth.

1754
00:36:40,403 --> 00:36:40,395
&nbsp

1755
00:36:40,405 --> 00:36:41,828
That can't be legal.

1756
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:41,830
&nbsp

1757
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,830
I mean, I won't tell if you won't.

1758
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:43,832
&nbsp

1759
00:36:43,842 --> 00:36:46,432
You know, for someone
so fixated on enforcing the law,

1760
00:36:46,442 --> 00:36:46,434
&nbsp

1761
00:36:46,444 --> 00:36:49,002
you sure seem oddly at ease
about breaking it.

1762
00:36:49,012 --> 00:36:49,004
&nbsp

1763
00:36:49,014 --> 00:36:51,471
Well, I guess some laws are worth breaking

1764
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:51,473
&nbsp

1765
00:36:51,483 --> 00:36:52,839
for the right person.

1766
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:52,841
&nbsp

1767
00:36:52,851 --> 00:36:55,275
- Mm.
- Hmm.

1768
00:36:55,285 --> 00:36:56,478
&nbsp

1769
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:57,977
So this goodbye then?

1770
00:36:57,987 --> 00:36:57,979
&nbsp

1771
00:36:57,989 --> 00:36:59,212
For now.

1772
00:36:59,222 --> 00:37:07,555
&nbsp

1773
00:37:07,565 --> 00:37:11,257
Wow.

1774
00:37:11,267 --> 00:37:11,259
&nbsp

1775
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:13,159
What an exit.

1776
00:37:13,169 --> 00:37:23,705
&nbsp

1777
00:37:23,715 --> 00:37:25,471
Okay, you know, for the fastest man alive,

1778
00:37:25,481 --> 00:37:25,473
&nbsp

1779
00:37:25,483 --> 00:37:27,875
you are the slowest reader.

1780
00:37:27,885 --> 00:37:27,917
&nbsp

1781
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:29,193
Hey this is your big article.

1782
00:37:29,203 --> 00:37:29,212
&nbsp

1783
00:37:29,222 --> 00:37:32,213
I'm not gonna rush through it.

1784
00:37:32,223 --> 00:37:32,215
&nbsp

1785
00:37:32,225 --> 00:37:34,682
I'm just kidding.
I read it five times already.

1786
00:37:34,692 --> 00:37:34,684
&nbsp

1787
00:37:34,694 --> 00:37:36,350
You sure sold the hell out of Kid Flash

1788
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,352
&nbsp

1789
00:37:36,362 --> 00:37:38,786
as Central City's next super savior.

1790
00:37:38,796 --> 00:37:38,788
&nbsp

1791
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,122
I'm sure Wally's loving that.

1792
00:37:41,132 --> 00:37:41,124
&nbsp

1793
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:44,025
Well, I did promise him the front page.

1794
00:37:44,035 --> 00:37:44,027
&nbsp

1795
00:37:44,037 --> 00:37:45,559
But what do you think?

1796
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:45,561
&nbsp

1797
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:47,061
Do you think it'll make any difference?

1798
00:37:47,071 --> 00:37:47,063
&nbsp

1799
00:37:47,073 --> 00:37:48,663
Kid Flash already changed one thing

1800
00:37:48,673 --> 00:37:48,665
&nbsp

1801
00:37:48,675 --> 00:37:50,131
that we saw in the future.

1802
00:37:50,141 --> 00:37:52,535
&nbsp

1803
00:37:52,545 --> 00:37:55,002
No, I meant the article.

1804
00:37:55,012 --> 00:37:55,004
&nbsp

1805
00:37:55,014 --> 00:37:56,203
What?

1806
00:37:56,213 --> 00:37:56,205
&nbsp

1807
00:37:56,215 --> 00:37:57,505
The article?

1808
00:37:57,515 --> 00:37:57,507
&nbsp

1809
00:37:57,517 --> 00:37:59,507
I think you should be really proud.

1810
00:37:59,517 --> 00:37:59,509
&nbsp

1811
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:01,542
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1812
00:38:01,552 --> 00:38:01,544
&nbsp

1813
00:38:01,554 --> 00:38:03,177
It's the beginning of...

1814
00:38:03,187 --> 00:38:03,179
&nbsp

1815
00:38:03,189 --> 00:38:05,246
an amazing journalistic legacy.

1816
00:38:05,256 --> 00:38:05,248
&nbsp

1817
00:38:05,258 --> 00:38:06,747
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1818
00:38:06,757 --> 00:38:06,749
&nbsp

1819
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:09,316
How amazing? Like Pulitzer amazing?

1820
00:38:09,326 --> 00:38:09,318
&nbsp

1821
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:12,353
Time will tell.

1822
00:38:12,363 --> 00:38:12,355
&nbsp

1823
00:38:12,365 --> 00:38:13,954
Hey, I'm sorry. I...

1824
00:38:13,964 --> 00:38:13,956
&nbsp

1825
00:38:13,966 --> 00:38:16,257
Do you know what I realized?

1826
00:38:16,267 --> 00:38:16,259
&nbsp

1827
00:38:16,269 --> 00:38:18,592
Savitar, he said that I trapped him

1828
00:38:18,602 --> 00:38:18,594
&nbsp

1829
00:38:18,604 --> 00:38:21,762
wherever he is; you know what that means?

1830
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:21,764
&nbsp

1831
00:38:21,774 --> 00:38:23,798
Means I beat him.

1832
00:38:23,808 --> 00:38:23,800
&nbsp

1833
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:27,168
And I'm gonna do it again, I promise.

1834
00:38:27,178 --> 00:38:27,170
&nbsp

1835
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,103
So don't worry.

1836
00:38:29,113 --> 00:38:29,105
&nbsp

1837
00:38:29,115 --> 00:38:31,238
The Flash is gonna save you.

1838
00:38:31,248 --> 00:38:34,077
&nbsp

1839
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:35,209
My hero.

1840
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:38,014
&nbsp

1841
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,780
The thing they never tell you

1842
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:39,782
&nbsp

1843
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:42,750
is that nothing ever stays the same.

1844
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:42,752
&nbsp

1845
00:38:42,762 --> 00:38:46,821
So the harder you work
to take down the bad guys,

1846
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:46,823
&nbsp

1847
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,222
the more they up their game.

1848
00:38:48,232 --> 00:38:48,224
&nbsp

1849
00:38:48,234 --> 00:38:50,458
- Hey.
- Hey.

1850
00:38:50,468 --> 00:38:50,460
&nbsp

1851
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,526
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

1852
00:38:52,536 --> 00:38:52,528
&nbsp

1853
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,961
No.

1854
00:38:53,971 --> 00:38:53,963
&nbsp

1855
00:38:53,973 --> 00:38:55,362
Just had to grab some stuff for...

1856
00:38:55,372 --> 00:38:55,364
&nbsp

1857
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,964
Yeah.

1858
00:38:56,974 --> 00:38:56,966
&nbsp

1859
00:38:56,976 --> 00:38:59,834
I thought you were finished
working with that stuff?

1860
00:38:59,844 --> 00:38:59,836
&nbsp

1861
00:38:59,846 --> 00:39:02,470
Oh, no, it's just, uh, this is just for me.

1862
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:02,472
&nbsp

1863
00:39:02,482 --> 00:39:04,472
No, the... the book, it... you know,

1864
00:39:04,482 --> 00:39:04,474
&nbsp

1865
00:39:04,484 --> 00:39:06,607
my own personal sense of accomplishment.

1866
00:39:06,617 --> 00:39:06,609
&nbsp

1867
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:08,309
Well,

1868
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:08,311
&nbsp

1869
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:10,077
you've accomplished plenty.

1870
00:39:10,087 --> 00:39:10,079
&nbsp

1871
00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:12,012
Ha! Ha!

1872
00:39:12,022 --> 00:39:12,014
&nbsp

1873
00:39:12,024 --> 00:39:13,647
What have I accomplished, Francisco?

1874
00:39:13,657 --> 00:39:13,649
&nbsp

1875
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:15,015
Well, for one,

1876
00:39:15,025 --> 00:39:15,017
&nbsp

1877
00:39:15,027 --> 00:39:16,751
you got me to risk my life to save yours.

1878
00:39:16,761 --> 00:39:16,753
&nbsp

1879
00:39:16,763 --> 00:39:19,320
And trust me, my friend,
that is a huge accomplishment.

1880
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:22,391
&nbsp

1881
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,292
Yeah, about that...

1882
00:39:25,302 --> 00:39:25,294
&nbsp

1883
00:39:25,304 --> 00:39:26,761
I just want to say that

1884
00:39:26,771 --> 00:39:26,763
&nbsp

1885
00:39:26,773 --> 00:39:28,596
I appreciate what you did for me.

1886
00:39:28,606 --> 00:39:28,598
&nbsp

1887
00:39:28,608 --> 00:39:32,032
Yeah, it's what we do
for our friends, right?

1888
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:32,034
&nbsp

1889
00:39:32,044 --> 00:39:35,469
Besides, it was a way
for me to balance the scales.

1890
00:39:35,479 --> 00:39:35,471
&nbsp

1891
00:39:35,481 --> 00:39:36,737
Balance the scales, right.

1892
00:39:36,747 --> 00:39:36,739
&nbsp

1893
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,405
What does that mean?

1894
00:39:38,415 --> 00:39:38,407
&nbsp

1895
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,274
I just mean...

1896
00:39:40,284 --> 00:39:40,276
&nbsp

1897
00:39:40,286 --> 00:39:42,209
I can't tell you the amount of times

1898
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:42,211
&nbsp

1899
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:44,211
that I've been in your shoes
and a man with your face

1900
00:39:44,221 --> 00:39:44,213
&nbsp

1901
00:39:44,223 --> 00:39:45,446
has made me feel better.

1902
00:39:45,456 --> 00:39:45,448
&nbsp

1903
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:46,714
Yeah, about that, I would...

1904
00:39:46,724 --> 00:39:47,950
&nbsp

1905
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,450
I would love if you could share

1906
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:49,452
&nbsp

1907
00:39:49,462 --> 00:39:51,252
some of my doppelganger's knowledge.

1908
00:39:51,262 --> 00:39:51,254
&nbsp

1909
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,386
I would love to know what

1910
00:39:52,396 --> 00:39:52,388
&nbsp

1911
00:39:52,398 --> 00:39:54,522
the smarter versions of me think.

1912
00:39:54,532 --> 00:39:54,524
&nbsp

1913
00:39:54,534 --> 00:39:55,923
Okay. Um...

1914
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:57,860
&nbsp

1915
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,627
The first Wells told me

1916
00:39:59,637 --> 00:39:59,629
&nbsp

1917
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:02,062
my time would come

1918
00:40:02,072 --> 00:40:02,064
&nbsp

1919
00:40:02,074 --> 00:40:03,330
to be a hero,

1920
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:03,332
&nbsp

1921
00:40:03,342 --> 00:40:06,767
that it was my job to show up,

1922
00:40:06,777 --> 00:40:06,769
&nbsp

1923
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:10,638
to be ready for when it did.

1924
00:40:10,648 --> 00:40:10,640
&nbsp

1925
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,339
You know why I love working here?

1926
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:12,341
&nbsp

1927
00:40:12,351 --> 00:40:13,941
Why?

1928
00:40:13,951 --> 00:40:13,943
&nbsp

1929
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:17,611
We're all making investments in each other.

1930
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:17,613
&nbsp

1931
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,146
I made an investment in you,

1932
00:40:19,156 --> 00:40:19,148
&nbsp

1933
00:40:19,158 --> 00:40:21,315
and one day, that investment's gonna pay off

1934
00:40:21,325 --> 00:40:21,317
&nbsp

1935
00:40:21,327 --> 00:40:22,983
when you use that...

1936
00:40:22,993 --> 00:40:22,985
&nbsp

1937
00:40:22,995 --> 00:40:27,354
crazy way of thinking you have
to help me out.

1938
00:40:27,364 --> 00:40:27,356
&nbsp

1939
00:40:27,366 --> 00:40:30,357
I guess if he were here, he would say,

1940
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:30,359
&nbsp

1941
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:31,692
"Show up."

1942
00:40:31,702 --> 00:40:31,694
&nbsp

1943
00:40:31,704 --> 00:40:33,427
Yeah.

1944
00:40:33,437 --> 00:40:33,429
&nbsp

1945
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:34,728
- Be ready.
- Yeah.

1946
00:40:34,738 --> 00:40:34,730
&nbsp

1947
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,897
'Cause...

1948
00:40:36,907 --> 00:40:36,899
&nbsp

1949
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:39,667
one day, you might need to save my ass.

1950
00:40:39,677 --> 00:41:04,694
&nbsp

1951
00:41:04,704 --> 00:41:07,862
Keep it up at this rate,
you're gonna reach Mach 3 soon.

1952
00:41:07,872 --> 00:41:07,864
&nbsp

1953
00:41:07,874 --> 00:41:09,630
I know, it's... it's crazy
how fast I've gotten

1954
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:09,632
&nbsp

1955
00:41:09,642 --> 00:41:11,632
- in such a short time, right?
- Yeah.

1956
00:41:11,642 --> 00:41:11,634
&nbsp

1957
00:41:11,644 --> 00:41:13,067
And I'm gonna need you to get a lot faster.

1958
00:41:13,077 --> 00:41:13,069
&nbsp

1959
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,835
Why's that?

1960
00:41:14,845 --> 00:41:14,837
&nbsp

1961
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,637
Because I've done the math
over and over and I finally

1962
00:41:16,647 --> 00:41:16,639
&nbsp

1963
00:41:16,649 --> 00:41:19,773
realized that I've been looking
at things the wrong way.

1964
00:41:19,783 --> 00:41:19,775
&nbsp

1965
00:41:19,785 --> 00:41:23,143
I'm not gonna save Iris from Savitar.

1966
00:41:23,153 --> 00:41:23,145
&nbsp

1967
00:41:23,155 --> 00:41:24,712
You are.

1968
00:41:24,722 --> 00:41:29,722
&nbsp
