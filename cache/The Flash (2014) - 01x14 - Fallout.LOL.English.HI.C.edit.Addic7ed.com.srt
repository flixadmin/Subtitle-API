1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,338
My name is Barry Allen and I
am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,140
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:10,178
by something impossible.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,249
My father went to prison for her murder.

5
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:17,095
Then an accident made me the impossible.

6
00:00:17,097 --> 00:00:19,867
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist

7
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:22,840
but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime

8
00:00:22,842 --> 00:00:24,608
and find others like me.

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,480
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother

10
00:00:27,482 --> 00:00:29,483
and get justice for my father.

11
00:00:29,485 --> 00:00:32,589
I am The Flash.

12
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:34,159
<i>Previously on The Flash...</i>

13
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:35,929
(West) That's Barry's old house.

14
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:37,900
Maybe it's been too long.
Everything's different.

15
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:39,101
Except that mirror.

16
00:00:39,103 --> 00:00:40,470
(Cisco) This mirror might contain

17
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:43,277
photographs of what happened that night.

18
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:45,146
That blood belongs to one
of the two speedsters

19
00:00:45,148 --> 00:00:46,381
that was here that night.

20
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:48,251
It's Barry's... As an adult.

21
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:50,187
Mrs. Stein, have you seen this person?

22
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:52,555
- Yes.
- He's not even Ronnie anymore.

23
00:00:52,557 --> 00:00:55,358
He's Martin Stein walking around
in Ronnie's body.

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,830
Any attempt we make
to separate the two of them

25
00:00:57,832 --> 00:01:00,632
could be catastrophic...
a nuclear explosion.

26
00:01:18,418 --> 00:01:20,786
Barry?

27
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:23,021
Barry, what happened out there?

28
00:01:23,023 --> 00:01:25,926
Are you guys okay?

29
00:01:25,928 --> 00:01:27,893
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

30
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:30,565
I think so.

31
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:32,403
Oh, God. The nuclear explosion.

32
00:01:32,405 --> 00:01:35,807
There's no telling how much
radiation we were exposed to.

33
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:37,677
Wait... wait, wait,
wait, wait, this can't be.

34
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:39,046
The Geiger counter in the suit...

35
00:01:39,048 --> 00:01:40,847
it's reading less than one millirad.

36
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:42,015
But that's normal.

37
00:01:42,017 --> 00:01:45,287
(Wells) There's no radiation.

38
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:47,322
Let's go.

39
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:06,574
(Cisco) Did it work?

40
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:07,806
Did you separate them?

41
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:09,606
I don't know.

42
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:17,283
Ronnie?

43
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:29,397
Tell me your name.

44
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,867
Ronnie Raymond.

45
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:33,170
Cait.

46
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:35,674
It's me.

47
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:41,818
Uh, pardon me.

48
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,456
Obviously, I need a change of clothes.

49
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:49,260
Nice to see you in the flesh
again, Professor Stein.

50
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:53,428
We're coming home.

51
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,502
All of us.

52
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:05,975
- Ronnie Raymond.
- Cisco.

53
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,512
Man. Ohh.

54
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:12,783
I missed you so much, man.

55
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:14,185
I shouldn't have locked you in there.

56
00:03:14,187 --> 00:03:16,622
Hey... don't.

57
00:03:16,624 --> 00:03:18,159
Welcome back, Mr. Raymond.

58
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:19,462
Dr. Wells.

59
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:21,028
Caitlin told me what happened to you.

60
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,661
I'm so sorry.

61
00:03:22,663 --> 00:03:24,430
I'm responsible for putting
myself in this chair.

62
00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:27,762
You are responsible for my
still being alive... thank you.

63
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:30,299
You said you'd bring him back, and you did.

64
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:31,736
Thank you.

65
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:32,771
You're welcome.

66
00:03:32,773 --> 00:03:34,306
Excuse me?

67
00:03:34,308 --> 00:03:37,806
Are we all planning to sing Kumbaya next?

68
00:03:37,808 --> 00:03:39,775
Professor Stein, I presume.

69
00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:41,410
Harrison Wells.

70
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:43,011
Do you have somewhere I can freshen up

71
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:44,810
and get a change of clothes?

72
00:03:44,812 --> 00:03:46,411
Of course.

73
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:49,013
Right this way, Professor.

74
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:55,854
(Bates) General, are you getting this?

75
00:03:55,856 --> 00:03:58,022
Roger that, Sergeant.

76
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:01,891
Sir, look at this.

77
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:03,227
Two imprints of impact.

78
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:05,899
Two imprints.

79
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:07,900
(Eiling) Two different people.

80
00:04:07,902 --> 00:04:11,836
It's Firestorm. He's separated.

81
00:04:11,838 --> 00:04:13,904
Your vitals appear to be normal,

82
00:04:13,906 --> 00:04:16,769
except you have a slight fever of 100.6.

83
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:18,371
Cait, I'm fine, I promise.

84
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:19,604
I know, but we just need to be...

85
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:21,240
Shh.

86
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:23,309
Yep... just when I forgot how awkward it was

87
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:24,544
to walk in on you two.

88
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:26,545
Well, you can get used to it again.

89
00:04:26,547 --> 00:04:28,616
So I did a full medical
workup on the professor.

90
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:32,220
It turns out that now that he
and Ronnie are separated,

91
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:33,621
they no longer possess the ability

92
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:35,190
to harness nuclear energy.

93
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,892
Professor Stein, you seem to be running

94
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:39,460
a little hot as well.

95
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:41,261
Same as Ronnie... 100.6.

96
00:04:41,263 --> 00:04:43,432
Hardly a sweat, Dr. Snow.

97
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:46,368
And hopefully now the only thing
Ronald and I have in common...

98
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,335
- It's Ronnie.
- Mm.

99
00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:49,503
Hey?

100
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:51,338
You gonna miss being able to fly?

101
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,841
Yeah, maybe if I was the one
holding the controller.

102
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:55,508
Meaning?

103
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,908
Meaning, you weren't the most
conscientious body-mate.

104
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,477
So you do not consider keeping you alive

105
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,445
to be conscientious?

106
00:05:01,447 --> 00:05:02,882
Alive?

107
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:04,316
We were living under
a bridge, eating garbage.

108
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:05,950
I did not determine that it would be

109
00:05:05,952 --> 00:05:08,284
my mind that would dominate our existence,

110
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:10,988
but thank God it was.

111
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,292
I could feel your fear and panic,

112
00:05:13,294 --> 00:05:15,128
emotions that likely
would have gotten us killed

113
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,095
in that state.

114
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:17,663
You kept me buried down.

115
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:19,666
You kept me from her.

116
00:05:19,668 --> 00:05:23,671
Which is likely why she's still alive.

117
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:25,039
Now I believe you and I have spent

118
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,006
quite enough time together.

119
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:27,274
Yeah.

120
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:28,608
I would like to go home to see my wife.

121
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,876
- Mr. Allen will take you.
- Thank you.

122
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:37,546
- I need some pizza.
- You got it.

123
00:05:42,284 --> 00:05:44,150
I can't believe it.

124
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:45,286
Oh... wait.

125
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:50,561
Uh... what should I say?

126
00:05:50,563 --> 00:05:53,330
I don't think you're gonna
have to say anything.

127
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:58,468
Oh, Clarissa.

128
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,678
I'm so sorry I put you through this.

129
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:15,059
[mouthing] Thank you.

130
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:18,129
Mister, uh... Barry.

131
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:19,563
Yeah?

132
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:24,267
Barry, I... I know I can be
difficult, but thank you

133
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:26,970
for bringing me home.

134
00:06:26,972 --> 00:06:29,505
I'll see you soon, Professor.

135
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:39,544
Hey.

136
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:40,643
I left you three messages.

137
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:42,143
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

138
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:44,278
About the lack of communication,
or that new hole

139
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,445
out in the badlands?

140
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,149
Uh, we're all fine, thanks.

141
00:06:48,151 --> 00:06:51,521
I wasn't calling about the explosion.

142
00:06:51,523 --> 00:06:53,254
I have to show you something.

143
00:06:53,256 --> 00:06:55,388
What?

144
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:12,078
It's smaller than I remember.

145
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,214
Yeah.

146
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:15,748
It's because you're bigger.

147
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,115
Have you been in here?

148
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:20,384
- I mean, recently.
- No.

149
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:25,761
I haven't been in this house
since that night.

150
00:07:25,763 --> 00:07:31,468
Bar? This mirror... you remember it?

151
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,101
Yeah. It belonged to my grandma.

152
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:36,372
How is it still here?

153
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:38,575
Just be glad it is.

154
00:07:38,577 --> 00:07:43,143
Look... I don't fully know
how Cisco did it, but...

155
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:48,150
Did what? Joe, what are we doing here?

156
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:06,192
Mom.

157
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,894
You can definitely see two very fast people

158
00:08:08,896 --> 00:08:10,296
fighting around your mother.

159
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:14,165
Two speedsters.

160
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,467
You see that?

161
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:17,104
The blood?

162
00:08:17,106 --> 00:08:21,073
Cisco and I had the DNA tested.

163
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:23,777
It's yours.

164
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:25,346
No, it's not. That's impossible.

165
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:27,081
I wasn't even downstairs yet.

166
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,279
No, Barry. Not that you.

167
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:31,648
This you.

168
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,117
Cisco had the samples
analyzed and the proteins

169
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:39,855
in the blood were that
of an adult, not a child.

170
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:41,256
But that means...

171
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:42,757
The second speedster,
the one trying to stop

172
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,758
the man in yellow...

173
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,129
Is the Flash.

174
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:48,700
That's me.

175
00:08:56,456 --> 00:08:58,658
Time travel.

176
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,393
If the last five months
have proven anything,

177
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:02,262
it's that anything can exist,

178
00:09:02,264 --> 00:09:05,196
but to actually travel through time?

179
00:09:05,198 --> 00:09:08,236
Well, the greatest minds in human history

180
00:09:08,238 --> 00:09:10,772
put their collective genius
towards solving that puzzle.

181
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:13,242
So. Is it possible?

182
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:14,846
Yes, it's possible.

183
00:09:14,848 --> 00:09:17,413
But problematic.

184
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:20,518
Assuming you could create
the conditions necessary

185
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,120
to take that journey...

186
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:23,720
well, that journey would then
befraught with potential pitfalls.

187
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:27,191
The Novikov principle of
self-consistency, for example.

188
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:28,659
Wait, the what, now?

189
00:09:28,661 --> 00:09:30,961
If you travel back in time
to change something,

190
00:09:30,963 --> 00:09:35,266
then you end up being
the causal factor of that event.

191
00:09:35,268 --> 00:09:37,068
Like<i> Terminator.</i>

192
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,069
Ah.

193
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:39,636
Or is time plastic?

194
00:09:39,638 --> 00:09:42,104
Is it mutable whereby
any changes to the continuum

195
00:09:42,106 --> 00:09:44,870
could create an alternate timeline.

196
00:09:44,872 --> 00:09:45,938
<i>Back To The Future.</i>

197
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,573
Oh... saw that one too.

198
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:51,744
Doc Brown. Tremendous picture.

199
00:09:51,746 --> 00:09:54,680
Right. So what's the answer?

200
00:09:54,682 --> 00:09:56,515
I might be a clever guy, Joe,
but if you're asking me

201
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:59,151
to give you a working theory on
how to travel through time,

202
00:09:59,153 --> 00:10:01,421
I'm afraid I just can't do that.

203
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:04,488
There is someone else
you can talk to about this.

204
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:13,864
Danish?

205
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:15,766
Why do you have a blueprint
of the S.T.A.R. Labs

206
00:10:15,768 --> 00:10:17,635
Particle Accelerator?

207
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:19,036
Do you actually know anything
about physics?

208
00:10:19,038 --> 00:10:21,373
Not a thing. Might as well be in Dothraki.

209
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,576
So what more is there
with the S.T.A.R. Labs story?

210
00:10:24,578 --> 00:10:25,945
The only new piece of information

211
00:10:25,947 --> 00:10:29,518
is the fact that Harrison Wells admitted
that he was warned of a potential disaster.

212
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,789
Yeah. Why do you think he did that?

213
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,458
Because he's a good person?

214
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,529
- Is he?
- Yes.

215
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:39,363
He saved my friend's life.

216
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:41,329
He was struck by lightning
that night and Dr. Wells

217
00:10:41,331 --> 00:10:42,530
and his team kept him alive.

218
00:10:42,532 --> 00:10:43,930
So?

219
00:10:43,932 --> 00:10:45,565
Your friend wouldn't have needed saving

220
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:48,034
if Wells hadn't zapped him
in the first place.

221
00:10:48,036 --> 00:10:50,069
It was an accident.

222
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:52,174
What if it wasn't?

223
00:10:52,176 --> 00:10:53,511
So you think Harrison Wells

224
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:55,880
wanted the Particle Accelerator to explode?

225
00:10:55,882 --> 00:10:57,447
Why would he do that?

226
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,454
I don't know what goes on
inside that building.

227
00:11:00,456 --> 00:11:02,891
But I think you know some people who do.

228
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:04,226
So you think I would investigate my friends

229
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:05,860
because you got me a danish?

230
00:11:05,862 --> 00:11:09,532
I think that you'll do it
because you really want

231
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:13,136
to know what goes on inside that building.

232
00:11:17,074 --> 00:11:19,041
[doorbell rings]

233
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:21,909
Barry?

234
00:11:21,911 --> 00:11:23,711
Mrs. Stein, I'm sorry to bother you here,

235
00:11:23,713 --> 00:11:25,848
but is Professor Stein here right now?

236
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,250
Well, after a year apart,

237
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:30,420
I'm not letting him out of my sight.

238
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:33,859
S.T.A.R. Labs did quite a few
tests on Martin,

239
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,794
didn't they... and they said he was fine?

240
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,896
Yeah. Why, is something wrong?

241
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,663
He just seems a little different, is all.

242
00:11:41,665 --> 00:11:43,366
Different how?

243
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:46,972
He's been asking for pizza.
Martin despises pizza.

244
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:49,708
Is that the delivery man? Oh, Mr. Allen.

245
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,909
I suppose it's too much
to hope you moonlight

246
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:56,747
as a pizza boy. I am famished.

247
00:11:56,749 --> 00:12:01,453
Okay.

248
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:05,995
Oh, bravo! Please, come in.

249
00:12:05,997 --> 00:12:08,464
Mr. Allen.

250
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:11,601
Oh, mmm. What can I do for you?

251
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:13,573
I... I needed to talk to you about a paper

252
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:15,110
that you wrote 25 years ago

253
00:12:15,112 --> 00:12:16,745
for the Oxford University Press.

254
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:18,378
I've written many papers
for that publication.

255
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,477
Could you be more specific
about the subject matter?

256
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:22,213
Time travel.

257
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,688
These are just a few of the random thoughts

258
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,090
I've had on the subject.

259
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:29,526
Few?

260
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:33,333
See, I believe that space-time

261
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,366
is a free-flowing highway

262
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:37,802
that intersects the physical world.

263
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:42,075
We live in... in the moments
between the on and off ramps.

264
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:44,310
Theoretically, to travel through time,

265
00:12:44,312 --> 00:12:47,345
one merely needs to find
a way onto the highway.

266
00:12:47,347 --> 00:12:50,381
Okay, so... so you're saying
that this is actually possible

267
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:52,382
to... to travel into the future?

268
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:54,049
Undoubtedly.

269
00:12:54,051 --> 00:12:55,518
What about the past?

270
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,652
Yes.

271
00:12:56,654 --> 00:12:59,120
My own personal choice would be

272
00:12:59,122 --> 00:13:01,492
the Chicago World's Fair, 1893.

273
00:13:01,494 --> 00:13:03,962
I... I think Nikola Tesla and I would have

274
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:05,197
some wonderful arguments.

275
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:06,830
What about you?

276
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:12,037
Would you be interested
in taking a trip into history?

277
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:17,376
I think that I already have.

278
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:19,909
Professor, um...

279
00:13:19,911 --> 00:13:22,414
15 years ago, my mom was murdered

280
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:27,651
and we recently discovered
some evidence that...

281
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:30,122
I was there that night,
and not just as a kid,

282
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:33,859
but as an adult.

283
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:39,634
That must be a side effect
of your incredible speed.

284
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:45,344
In some... future date,
you actually move so fast

285
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:48,280
that the resulting kinetic energy buildup

286
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:53,047
smashes a hole in the space-time continuum!

287
00:13:56,982 --> 00:14:02,688
You seem disappointed by the prospect.

288
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,526
I mean, if I do somehow make it back there

289
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:12,502
to that night, then...
it means that I didn't save her.

290
00:14:12,504 --> 00:14:15,304
My destiny is to fail.

291
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:22,549
And the boomerang goes flying
through the cortex,

292
00:14:22,551 --> 00:14:24,718
smashing everything and Cisco's all,

293
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,153
"My bad. This one's on me."

294
00:14:28,155 --> 00:14:29,923
Sounds like you had some crazy times.

295
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:31,859
Yeah, we have.

296
00:14:31,861 --> 00:14:33,893
Are you ready for life
to get back to normal?

297
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:35,427
What do you mean?

298
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:38,330
I was thinking we could leave town.

299
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:41,436
Start fresh somewhere.

300
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:44,603
Our lives are here. My job is here.

301
00:14:44,605 --> 00:14:47,841
Yeah, hunting meta-humans.

302
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:49,744
There's more to it than that.

303
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:53,345
- And it's dangerous.
- It can be.

304
00:14:53,817 --> 00:14:59,284
Look, I stayed at S.T.A.R. Labs
because I believed in Dr. Wells.

305
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:04,627
But ever since Barry became
The Flash and we've been working

306
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:07,164
to keep this city safe,

307
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,436
I found a new way to help people.

308
00:15:10,438 --> 00:15:13,173
Look, Cait, I'm not mad at anyone.

309
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:16,410
Okay, I know the accelerator
explosion was an accident.

310
00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:19,280
But that building took a year of our lives.

311
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:22,650
I don't want it to take anymore.

312
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:25,788
Do you guys need anything else?
We're about to close up.

313
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:31,390
I'm good. Babe?

314
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:32,925
Ronnie, get down.

315
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:37,465
- Get out of here.
- No, not without you.

316
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:39,570
I'm right behind you... go!

317
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,310
- Professor?
- Martin?

318
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:46,645
What's wrong?

319
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:49,981
I don't know, I... I feel terrified.

320
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,117
My... my heart is racing.

321
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:03,559
(Man) Hands in the air!

322
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:06,361
I think... I think Ronald is in trouble.

323
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:08,197
How could you know that?

324
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:10,100
Jitters. He needs help.

325
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,534
Go!

326
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:17,775
Ronald Raymond.

327
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,079
Burning Man himself.

328
00:16:20,081 --> 00:16:21,611
Half of him, anyway.

329
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:22,979
Who are you?

330
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:25,850
General Wade Eiling, United States Army.

331
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,419
What do you want?

332
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:30,087
Firestorm.

333
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,441
[screams in pain]

334
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:50,309
Stings, doesn't it?

335
00:16:50,311 --> 00:16:52,547
Had that one developed especially for you.

336
00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:55,318
Micro fragments
attracted to kinetic energy.

337
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,020
Firestorm was tonight's main objective,

338
00:16:57,022 --> 00:17:00,022
but getting you... that's just gravy.

339
00:17:05,362 --> 00:17:07,032
Get in!

340
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:14,807
Gentlemen, we are at war.

341
00:17:23,071 --> 00:17:24,272
You need to hurry, Barry's wounds

342
00:17:24,274 --> 00:17:25,306
are starting to heal with the fragments

343
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:26,906
still under his skin.

344
00:17:26,908 --> 00:17:29,309
This is just like that time
I stepped on a sea urchin.

345
00:17:29,311 --> 00:17:30,610
Only much worse.

346
00:17:30,612 --> 00:17:32,446
Just don't pee on me.

347
00:17:32,448 --> 00:17:35,015
Uh, you know that's a myth, right?

348
00:17:35,017 --> 00:17:39,088
[yells]

349
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,790
I'm so stupid.

350
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:43,325
Jason Rush, the grad student
who was helping Professor Stein

351
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:45,695
with his Firestorm research,
he said that the Army

352
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,431
took all of Professor Stein's
material when he disappeared.

353
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:50,133
I should have known it was General Eiling.

354
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,534
Not your fault.

355
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:53,136
He still thinks you hold
the keys to the ultimate

356
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,073
human weapon... both of you.

357
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,644
Okay, let's just finish this.
I gotta get to Stein's house.

358
00:17:57,646 --> 00:17:58,712
Eiling's gonna be after him too.

359
00:17:58,714 --> 00:18:00,114
Stein's fine.

360
00:18:00,116 --> 00:18:02,850
- How do you know?
- He's right there.

361
00:18:02,852 --> 00:18:06,258
I don't think Mr. Raymond
and I are as distinctive

362
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,994
as we had hoped.

363
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:11,328
I'm still inside Ronald.

364
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,663
There has to be a better way
to phrase that.

365
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:16,433
Beta, Alpha, Theta, Delta...
all your brain waves

366
00:18:16,435 --> 00:18:18,136
are perfectly in sync.

367
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,969
The chances of that happening
are next to impossible.

368
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:23,339
Impossible's just another
Tuesday for us, remember?

369
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:26,346
Yeah, but this is like
some<i> Twilight Zone</i> level stuff,

370
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:28,015
and I say that knowing
full well that we have

371
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:29,216
a guy locked up in our basement

372
00:18:29,218 --> 00:18:30,751
who can turn himself into poison gas.

373
00:18:30,753 --> 00:18:31,952
Wait, really?

374
00:18:31,954 --> 00:18:33,520
Dude, that was, like, week three.

375
00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:36,055
Look, if this Eiling is as
dangerous as you say,

376
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:37,657
then I need to warn Clarissa.

377
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:40,326
I promise, I can get Clarissa
out of the city in time,

378
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,462
but we need you to stay here.

379
00:18:42,464 --> 00:18:45,432
Professor, I need you to trust us.

380
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:47,435
Very well.

381
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:55,612
Hey. Are you okay?

382
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:57,415
Yeah.

383
00:18:57,417 --> 00:19:01,182
Yeah, it's just not
the S.T.A.R. Labs I knew.

384
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:04,587
Ronnie, this isn't the world that you knew.

385
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:06,455
Tell me about it.

386
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:10,626
All right, here we are.

387
00:19:10,628 --> 00:19:12,127
Uh, all right.

388
00:19:12,129 --> 00:19:14,662
You guys can stay down in Iris' old room.

389
00:19:14,664 --> 00:19:18,166
- It's kind of small, but...
- Hey.

390
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:19,534
- We have guests.
- Yeah, we do.

391
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:20,769
I hope that's okay.

392
00:19:20,771 --> 00:19:23,575
- <i>Mi casa.</i>
- This is Ronnie.

393
00:19:23,577 --> 00:19:25,943
Nice to meet you.

394
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:28,983
- Ronnie, the...
- Dead fiance.

395
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:31,086
Right.

396
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,922
- Beer?
- Thanks.

397
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:35,557
Dad? Barry?

398
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:38,195
- Iris, hi.
- Hi.

399
00:19:38,197 --> 00:19:39,162
What are you doing here?

400
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:40,897
Uh, it's Tuesday.

401
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:43,132
I was gonna make us dinner, remember?

402
00:19:43,134 --> 00:19:44,335
- Yep.
- Yeah.

403
00:19:44,337 --> 00:19:45,671
Here, I'll help. Got it.

404
00:19:45,673 --> 00:19:47,640
I knew you'd forget.

405
00:19:47,642 --> 00:19:49,442
Well, there's plenty for everyone.

406
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:51,778
Caitlin, what brings you by?

407
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,713
There's a gas leak in my apartment,

408
00:19:53,715 --> 00:19:56,345
so Barry said that we could stay here.

409
00:19:56,347 --> 00:20:00,483
Oh, that's sweet of him.
And, uh, who's this?

410
00:20:00,485 --> 00:20:04,518
- This is, uh...
- Her cousin.

411
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,454
- Sam.
- Visiting from Coast City.

412
00:20:09,456 --> 00:20:12,553
You look really familiar, Sam.

413
00:20:12,555 --> 00:20:15,421
Yeah, I... I have... one of those faces.

414
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,258
So what's for dinner?

415
00:20:23,398 --> 00:20:25,433
- Harrison.
- Wade.

416
00:20:25,435 --> 00:20:29,266
I had a feeling you would be wheeling by.

417
00:20:29,268 --> 00:20:31,269
Tell me.

418
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,942
They still pulling needles
out of Barry Allen's hide?

419
00:20:38,014 --> 00:20:39,782
I guess your sweet little Flash didn't want

420
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:45,394
Sergeant Sans Soucie to die
looking into a mask.

421
00:20:45,796 --> 00:20:48,127
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

422
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:57,606
I don't know how Firestorm works.

423
00:20:57,608 --> 00:21:02,281
Well, you may not know
the how, but you know the who.

424
00:21:02,283 --> 00:21:04,749
Both of them.

425
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:08,887
Thanks to you, it's the dawn
of a new age, Harrison.

426
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:11,354
Cold War, the war on terror.

427
00:21:11,356 --> 00:21:13,123
We'll seem like cave men
fighting with sticks

428
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:18,194
once those two freaks bind together.

429
00:21:18,196 --> 00:21:19,529
Well, you know where to find me

430
00:21:19,531 --> 00:21:22,696
when you've come to the right decision.

431
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,697
And I know you will.

432
00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:28,070
After all, you're the smartest guy I know.

433
00:21:41,076 --> 00:21:44,375
Bar?

434
00:21:44,377 --> 00:21:47,044
Should I have not shown you?

435
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:51,518
No, I had to know.

436
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,887
We have been through so much.
You have... all your life.

437
00:21:58,459 --> 00:22:02,428
And you've been so strong.

438
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:06,931
But I am still your guardian,

439
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:09,669
and it's my job to guard you,

440
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:13,437
not just physically, but from heartache.

441
00:22:15,205 --> 00:22:17,638
I can't help but feeling
like I just handed you

442
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,307
a brand new burden.

443
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:26,274
Yeah. But it's our burden, right?

444
00:22:26,276 --> 00:22:31,343
Yeah. Yeah.

445
00:22:31,345 --> 00:22:32,712
Hey, can I ask you something?

446
00:22:32,714 --> 00:22:34,382
Mm hmm.

447
00:22:34,384 --> 00:22:37,620
How did you know that the blood
in the house belonged to me?

448
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:41,728
You would have had to have
tested it specifically.

449
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,330
Cisco tested it against everyone who worked

450
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:49,434
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

451
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:54,941
You wanted to know if it belonged to Wells?

452
00:22:54,943 --> 00:22:58,410
Joe.

453
00:22:58,412 --> 00:23:03,682
Dr. Wells had nothing to do
with my mom's murder.

454
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,786
You believe that now?

455
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:10,021
Yeah.

456
00:23:10,023 --> 00:23:11,790
Yeah, yeah... I do.

457
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:24,338
Cheers.

458
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,007
Cheers.

459
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:30,675
Delicious.

460
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:33,481
This is quite an impressive facility.

461
00:23:33,483 --> 00:23:36,220
Well, it was.

462
00:23:36,222 --> 00:23:40,193
Now it's just a shell, I'm afraid.

463
00:23:40,195 --> 00:23:43,531
Must have been devastating,
seeing your life's work

464
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:47,003
fall to pieces before your eyes.

465
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:51,275
It was and yet,
it was the exact same moment

466
00:23:51,277 --> 00:23:54,013
your life's work came to fruition.

467
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,719
My life's work?

468
00:23:56,721 --> 00:24:02,058
If living the last 14 months
as a conjoined meta-human

469
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,297
has taught me anything,
it's that my life's work

470
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:10,703
should have been being the best
husband I could to my wife.

471
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:18,517
Are you all right, Martin?

472
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:21,288
I apologize, it's just...

473
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,455
I feel a little light-headed.

474
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:26,961
[glass shattering]

475
00:24:26,963 --> 00:24:28,865
Are you okay?

476
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,465
Uh...yeah.

477
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:32,832
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

478
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:35,968
Just got a little dizzy for a second.

479
00:24:42,475 --> 00:24:45,277
You want the secret to Firestorm.

480
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,514
He has it.

481
00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:50,751
See, Harrison? We do work well together.

482
00:25:04,631 --> 00:25:06,132
Oh, hey... hey.

483
00:25:06,134 --> 00:25:07,200
You said you knew some of
the leftover scientists

484
00:25:07,202 --> 00:25:08,605
at the S.T.A.R. Lab.

485
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,675
What about a Caitlin Snow, M.D.
You know her?

486
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,042
Yeah, I know her, why?

487
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:13,710
There was an incident
at a local coffee shop.

488
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,779
She was there.

489
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:18,647
That's Jitters. I used to work there.

490
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:21,483
Is there anything you can't do?

491
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:22,613
Gimme this.

492
00:25:22,615 --> 00:25:24,115
Witnesses swear they saw soldiers

493
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:25,716
shooting the place up,
so I contacted the Army's

494
00:25:25,718 --> 00:25:27,918
media relations division and asked,

495
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,620
"Are soldiers permitted
to operate like that

496
00:25:29,622 --> 00:25:30,754
on U.S. soil?"

497
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:31,988
You know what they told me?

498
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,655
Hooah.

499
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,390
That's weird, Caitlin didn't
mention anything

500
00:25:35,392 --> 00:25:36,928
the last time I saw her.

501
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,031
Really?

502
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:40,267
When and where was that?

503
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:45,204
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure there's
an explanation for all of this.

504
00:26:05,489 --> 00:26:06,754
He didn't hurt you?

505
00:26:06,756 --> 00:26:09,358
Barry, I told you... only my pride is hurt.

506
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,695
Unfortunately, I'm not
in the position to take on

507
00:26:10,697 --> 00:26:12,064
armed soldiers.

508
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:13,698
Where do you think
Eiling took Professor Stein?

509
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,899
I imagine some off-the-books
military research facility.

510
00:26:15,901 --> 00:26:17,433
We have to get him back.

511
00:26:17,435 --> 00:26:20,267
Easy... Eiling has already
demonstrated he has the weaponry

512
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:22,369
to disable The Flash, or worse.

513
00:26:22,371 --> 00:26:25,273
Well, we can't let him
turn Stein into a weapon.

514
00:26:25,275 --> 00:26:27,943
How do we find him?

515
00:26:34,721 --> 00:26:35,921
What?

516
00:26:37,424 --> 00:26:39,191
No abnormal brain activity.

517
00:26:39,193 --> 00:26:40,492
All vitals steady.

518
00:26:40,494 --> 00:26:41,893
You really think Ronnie can somehow feel

519
00:26:41,895 --> 00:26:43,294
where they're keeping Stein?

520
00:26:43,296 --> 00:26:44,963
Ronnie got dizzy when
the soldiers grabbed Stein,

521
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:47,464
and Stein developed
Ronnie's obsession with pizza.

522
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:49,597
I don't feel anything right now.

523
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,565
Just keep trying.

524
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:52,598
Whatever this is, it doesn't have

525
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,466
an on and off switch.

526
00:26:54,468 --> 00:26:58,003
It's possible it's just some
kind of residual connection.

527
00:26:58,005 --> 00:27:00,773
A temporary link to your time together.

528
00:27:00,775 --> 00:27:04,173
Wait. I feel something.

529
00:27:07,577 --> 00:27:09,877
I'm... I'm cold.

530
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,613
It's freezing in here!

531
00:27:11,615 --> 00:27:15,620
My apologies.
It should warm up pretty quick.

532
00:27:21,424 --> 00:27:23,291
I know what you want.

533
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:28,632
But my research was never
intended to be used as a weapon.

534
00:27:28,634 --> 00:27:31,035
I joined the military
when I was 20 years old,

535
00:27:31,037 --> 00:27:32,469
Professor.

536
00:27:32,471 --> 00:27:34,639
My father had me convinced
that our greatest threat

537
00:27:34,641 --> 00:27:35,708
was the Soviets.

538
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:38,180
Our greatest fear... nuclear war.

539
00:27:38,182 --> 00:27:41,018
Then came terrorism

540
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,488
and Ebola.

541
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,158
And now, it's the age of Firestorm.

542
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,528
Soldiers enhanced
by your project, Professor.

543
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,231
Soldiers who can generate energy blasts

544
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:51,998
with their bare hands.

545
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,132
Soldiers who can fly.

546
00:27:54,134 --> 00:27:58,372
I would gladly die
before I see my life's work

547
00:27:58,374 --> 00:28:00,374
perverted in this way.

548
00:28:00,376 --> 00:28:04,142
Good. Because you will die, Professor.

549
00:28:04,144 --> 00:28:09,715
How soon I let that happen,
though, is entirely up to you.

550
00:28:09,717 --> 00:28:13,955
What's going on?

551
00:28:13,957 --> 00:28:16,828
Last time I did this was to a gorilla.

552
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:20,166
[screams]

553
00:28:21,502 --> 00:28:22,902
[screams]

554
00:28:22,904 --> 00:28:24,604
You're okay, man, we got you.

555
00:28:24,606 --> 00:28:26,305
What's happening to him?

556
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:28,006
Nothing's happening to him.

557
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:31,408
It's happening to Stein,
and Ronnie is feeling his pain.

558
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,744
I was wrong.

559
00:28:32,746 --> 00:28:33,779
The connection's not temporary.

560
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:37,416
It's only getting stronger.

561
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:40,117
Just try and hold on.

562
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,619
Water. Water.

563
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:55,729
My, my, my, my, my, my.

564
00:28:55,731 --> 00:29:00,300
You show remarkable grit for a teacher.

565
00:29:00,302 --> 00:29:02,000
I am impressed.

566
00:29:02,002 --> 00:29:04,903
Why don't we let you catch your breath?

567
00:29:04,905 --> 00:29:07,902
Think about how much more
of this you want to endure.

568
00:29:07,904 --> 00:29:09,437
Hmm?

569
00:29:17,212 --> 00:29:18,213
Ronnie, no!

570
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:19,215
Wait, Cait, wait.

571
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:20,250
He's cutting himself.

572
00:29:20,252 --> 00:29:23,158
I know. Let him.

573
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,911
Ronald.

574
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:50,819
[taps]

575
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:53,256
Anything?

576
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:56,862
Nothing. Nothing, just...just cold.

577
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:01,634
Like a metal surface.
Pressure on and on and off.

578
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:06,543
Tap, tap. Tap.

579
00:30:06,545 --> 00:30:09,311
Tap. Tap.

580
00:30:09,313 --> 00:30:10,413
Tap, tap, tap.

581
00:30:10,415 --> 00:30:11,447
Morse code.

582
00:30:11,449 --> 00:30:12,916
I got this.

583
00:30:12,918 --> 00:30:15,622
Same thing again. Tap, tap.

584
00:30:15,624 --> 00:30:21,531
Tap.

585
00:30:21,533 --> 00:30:23,032
Tap, tap, tap.

586
00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:25,631
- 27.
- What does it mean?

587
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:30,170
Army bases... they sometimes
go by numbers, like Area 51.

588
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:32,338
Facility 27, about 300 miles away.

589
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,941
It was shut down in 1961.

590
00:30:33,943 --> 00:30:35,677
Well, that's where they're keeping Stein.

591
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,246
Bet you that's where
they're keeping aliens too.

592
00:30:37,248 --> 00:30:38,515
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

593
00:30:38,517 --> 00:30:39,852
You can't.

594
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:41,421
I'm connected to Stein. I have to go.

595
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,257
But did you ever stop
to think why your connection

596
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:45,125
to him is growing stronger by the minute?

597
00:30:45,127 --> 00:30:46,892
Maybe you're being drawn back together.

598
00:30:46,894 --> 00:30:49,961
Maybe your proximity will cause
you to re-merge into one.

599
00:30:49,963 --> 00:30:54,435
And what happens to me if he gets killed?

600
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:56,767
Cait, Barry was right.

601
00:30:56,769 --> 00:30:58,636
The world is different now.

602
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:00,907
Look, I... I thought we could get away,

603
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:03,746
start a new life, a normal life, together.

604
00:31:03,748 --> 00:31:06,048
But there is no normal life for us.

605
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:09,319
You will always risk your life
to try and help people,

606
00:31:09,321 --> 00:31:11,489
and I will always be the guy that runs

607
00:31:11,491 --> 00:31:16,124
into that pipeline for you.

608
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:17,325
The quantum splicer.

609
00:31:17,327 --> 00:31:19,228
It was used to separate you once.

610
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,197
Maybe it could be of use to keep you you.

611
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:23,898
Thanks.

612
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,132
- Okay, let's go.
- Wait.

613
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:34,375
Come back. All three of you.

614
00:31:36,044 --> 00:31:37,478
Let's go.

615
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,408
Oh.

616
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,407
This place definitely
doesn't look too shady.

617
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:57,343
Stein's inside.

618
00:31:57,345 --> 00:31:58,844
I can feel our connection growing stronger,

619
00:31:58,846 --> 00:32:00,412
like he's pulling me.

620
00:32:00,645 --> 00:32:02,410
It's as I feared... the Firestorm matrix

621
00:32:02,412 --> 00:32:04,713
is building toward a proximity reemergence.

622
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:07,884
Like all matter, it yearns to be whole.

623
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:14,160
If you do merge...

624
00:32:14,162 --> 00:32:17,762
we might not be able to separate you again.

625
00:32:17,764 --> 00:32:19,564
We've been able to isolate
the Firestorm matrix

626
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:21,502
inside the subject's cellular structure.

627
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,238
Excellent.

628
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,840
Professor Stein,

629
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:28,280
I'm afraid you have
made a terrible assumption...

630
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:31,815
That I need you alive.

631
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:34,315
Eiling has a gun to Stein's head.

632
00:32:34,317 --> 00:32:35,915
He's about to pull the trigger.

633
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:42,456
He's here.

634
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,760
Ho!

635
00:32:45,762 --> 00:32:47,728
Whoa... I never thought
I'd be happy to see you.

636
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,164
- Yeah, likewise.
- Let's get out of here.

637
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:04,578
[screams]

638
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,746
Run!

639
00:33:05,748 --> 00:33:07,614
Okay... come on, come on.

640
00:33:11,752 --> 00:33:14,854
Barry, I'm picking up some
serious pH numbers on your suit.

641
00:33:14,856 --> 00:33:16,557
They hit me with some kind of chemical.

642
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,894
(Cisco) It's a weaponized phosphorous.

643
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:20,131
Water or foam won't extinguish it.

644
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:24,268
But you can't burn in a vacuum,
so you need to create one.

645
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,705
Run, Barry. Run!

646
00:33:41,626 --> 00:33:43,360
- We need to merge again.
- Ronnie, no!

647
00:33:43,362 --> 00:33:44,628
Cait, we're dead if we don't.

648
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,159
Listen to me.

649
00:33:46,161 --> 00:33:47,994
The last time you two combined,
you both fought it.

650
00:33:47,996 --> 00:33:50,130
This time, don't.

651
00:33:50,132 --> 00:33:52,967
Accept the change, accept the balance.

652
00:33:52,969 --> 00:33:54,802
Accept each other.

653
00:33:54,804 --> 00:33:57,675
Once more unto the breach, dear friend.

654
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:07,716
Cait... whatever happens, just
remember I'll always love you.

655
00:34:22,832 --> 00:34:23,834
(Stein) Can you hear me, Ronald?

656
00:34:23,836 --> 00:34:24,871
Professor?

657
00:34:24,873 --> 00:34:26,173
(Stein) It appears we merged

658
00:34:26,175 --> 00:34:27,609
properly on this attempt.

659
00:34:27,611 --> 00:34:29,811
Wells was right about
balance and accepting.

660
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:31,079
Behind you!

661
00:34:35,952 --> 00:34:37,552
(Stein) Ronald, there's more of them.

662
00:34:52,697 --> 00:34:55,866
Eiling, this ends now.

663
00:34:55,868 --> 00:34:57,768
Yes, it does...

664
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,204
For both of you.

665
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:04,947
An ion grenade.

666
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:07,050
Just bombarded your cellular
structure with enough ions

667
00:35:07,052 --> 00:35:09,687
to destabilize your matrix.

668
00:35:09,689 --> 00:35:15,160
Mr. Raymond, Professor Stein,
you're both fine Americans.

669
00:35:15,162 --> 00:35:17,930
Your country thanks you for your sacrifice.

670
00:35:22,866 --> 00:35:25,166
That was a lot of running.

671
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:38,444
Ronnie?

672
00:35:38,446 --> 00:35:41,114
- Home?
- Yeah.

673
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,891
I think it looks worse than it is.

674
00:36:05,694 --> 00:36:07,496
Ronnie or Stein?

675
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,834
It's me, Cait.

676
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:10,602
[Stein clearing throat] Excuse me.

677
00:36:10,604 --> 00:36:12,670
It's both of us. Somehow.

678
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,339
(Stein) She's quite lovely.

679
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,709
Acceptance is a powerful thing.

680
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:18,210
Powerful enough to reverse it?

681
00:36:18,212 --> 00:36:20,514
(Stein) I'm game if you are, Mr. Raymond.

682
00:36:20,516 --> 00:36:22,514
We could try.

683
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:50,246
I think we're getting
the hang of this quite nicely.

684
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,765
It's okay.

685
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:08,202
I understand. You have to go.

686
00:37:08,204 --> 00:37:09,570
How'd you know?

687
00:37:09,572 --> 00:37:12,907
I'm connected to you too.

688
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:26,590
Where will you go?

689
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:28,125
Pittsburgh, maybe.

690
00:37:28,127 --> 00:37:29,627
Professor Stein has a colleague he thinks

691
00:37:29,629 --> 00:37:32,397
can help us learn more about our abilities.

692
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:33,866
We can help you here too.

693
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:35,835
Eiling has already breached S.T.A.R. Labs.

694
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,071
We need to stay one step ahead of him...

695
00:37:38,073 --> 00:37:40,407
for all of us.

696
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:43,911
- I'm coming back.
- We'll have pizza.

697
00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:54,083
Godspeed, Mr. Allen.

698
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:55,751
You too.

699
00:37:55,753 --> 00:38:01,420
As to our earlier conversation,
I believe in second chances.

700
00:38:01,422 --> 00:38:03,455
You'll get yours.

701
00:38:03,457 --> 00:38:07,427
Give it time.

702
00:38:07,429 --> 00:38:11,263
- Ready, Ronald?
- Please stop calling me that.

703
00:38:11,265 --> 00:38:14,165
I'll see you soon.

704
00:38:34,856 --> 00:38:37,158
We love you.

705
00:38:48,237 --> 00:38:49,939
I had Ronnie, then I lost him.

706
00:38:49,941 --> 00:38:52,744
Then I found him again,
but he wasn't actually Ronnie.

707
00:38:52,746 --> 00:38:56,649
Then I got him back but just for
a day until I lost him again.

708
00:38:56,651 --> 00:38:59,924
You guys are like 10 seasons
of Ross and Rachel,

709
00:38:59,926 --> 00:39:05,161
but just, like, smushed into one year.

710
00:39:05,163 --> 00:39:08,564
I am not heartbroken this time.

711
00:39:08,566 --> 00:39:11,067
I love Ronnie. I always will,

712
00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:16,310
but there's not this
devastating hole inside me.

713
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:20,550
I have a life, and it's a good one.

714
00:39:20,552 --> 00:39:21,919
Hey, guys.

715
00:39:21,921 --> 00:39:23,857
- Iris, hi.
- Hi.

716
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:25,890
Where is your cousin?

717
00:39:25,892 --> 00:39:27,924
Uh, he went home.

718
00:39:27,926 --> 00:39:30,563
Oh. Uh, where was that again?

719
00:39:30,565 --> 00:39:33,499
Uh, Midway.

720
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:36,703
Oh, I thought you said Coast City.

721
00:39:36,705 --> 00:39:40,039
Uh, Midway via Coast City.

722
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:42,243
He moved around a lot.

723
00:39:42,245 --> 00:39:44,845
That's always really hard.

724
00:39:44,847 --> 00:39:47,547
All right, well. Enjoy.

725
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:49,817
- Bye.
- See you.

726
00:39:57,755 --> 00:39:59,588
Am I supposed to know what that means?

727
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,258
It means that I'm gonna help you figure out

728
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,695
what's going on at S.T.A.R. Labs.

729
00:40:03,697 --> 00:40:06,865
I think our Burning Man used to work there.

730
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:09,534
[door bell rings]

731
00:40:09,536 --> 00:40:10,902
- Yo.
- Hey.

732
00:40:10,904 --> 00:40:14,777
So why'd you bring me here?

733
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,546
I don't know how and I don't know when,

734
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,416
but one day soon, I'm gonna be

735
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,153
in this house again,

736
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:23,089
15 years ago.

737
00:40:23,091 --> 00:40:24,859
And I'm gonna fail...

738
00:40:24,861 --> 00:40:26,261
Unless this time, I don't.

739
00:40:26,263 --> 00:40:27,929
What are you saying?

740
00:40:27,931 --> 00:40:32,266
Knowing that I'm supposed
to lose gives me the advantage.

741
00:40:32,268 --> 00:40:37,234
Those images are a lesson
in what not to do.

742
00:40:37,236 --> 00:40:40,805
When I face off against the man in yellow,

743
00:40:40,807 --> 00:40:44,277
I won't make the same mistake twice.

744
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:46,576
You're gonna... change the past?

745
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:49,846
Joe... I'm gonna save my mom.

746
00:40:57,284 --> 00:40:59,987
[electric buzzing]

747
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:12,763
What... what the hell was that?

748
00:41:12,765 --> 00:41:14,965
(distorted voice) It's good
to see you again, General.

749
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:16,667
Who are you?

750
00:41:16,669 --> 00:41:19,338
(distorted voice) Who am I?

751
00:41:25,144 --> 00:41:29,113
Harrison... You're one of them.

752
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:31,213
A meta-human.

753
00:41:31,215 --> 00:41:33,280
Yes, I am.

754
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,848
And I protect my own.

755
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:39,183
[growls]

756
00:41:39,185 --> 00:41:40,782
Who was that?

757
00:41:40,784 --> 00:41:43,316
Now, that...

758
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:44,918
is an old friend of ours.

759
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,989
(Grodd) General...

760
00:41:47,991 --> 00:41:50,258
That... voice...

761
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,065
It's in my head.

762
00:41:54,067 --> 00:41:55,032
Dear God.

763
00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:58,501
Not God. Grodd.

764
00:41:58,503 --> 00:42:00,038
