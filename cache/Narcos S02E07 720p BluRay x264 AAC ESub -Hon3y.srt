[in English] What we know is that Escobar

Mr. President,
we need to prevent that from happening.

175
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,241
We need to keep the family in play.
If they're allowed to leave Colombia,

176
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,280
we're gonna lose leverage
in the hunt for Escobar.

Legally, there's no way we can stop them
from flying out of the country.

By applying pressure behind the scenes,

179
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,536
we can prevent the family
from being accepted upon arrival.

180
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,088
And if they're kept in Colombia,
he's gonna be worried about their safety.

181
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:33,327
He'll be more likely to make phone
contact, more likely to... make mistakes.

182
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,689
Because they're more likely
to become victims of Los Pepes.

183
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,689
Mr. President... if the family gets safe
haven, there's no telling what comes next.

Maybe Escobar surrenders,
maybe he goes to war.

185
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,800
The family is leverage. We have to use it.

The first man who smoked marijuana
was a Chinese emperor.

345
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,884
He burned the plant because
he was attracted to its smell.

346
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,521
But when he inhaled the smoke,
he saw a blue jay.

347
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:52,402
And the bird told him
to conquer his neighboring empires.

348
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,084
And that's what he did.

- There's a lot of interference.

458
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,363
Yes. Medellin has too many electrical
wires, phone wires, antennae.

459
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,444
- That must be why.
- What's your success rate?

460
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,891
[sighs] To be honest,
we haven't located a signal yet.

461
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,724
Not one?

462
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,800
Notone.

Here's what we're going to do, Morales.

465
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:31,769
Let's both start here: L9.329.

466

There it is.

467
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,565
I was talking to my police contact and
you won't guess who's hiding the lawyer.

468
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,601
None other than that son of a bitch, Pefia.
What do you think about that?

469
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,843
Who's your contact?

470
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,687
Who he is isn't important.
The important thing is that I trust him.

471
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,886
And you know what
the worst part of this is?

472
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,042
We can no longer trust Pefia.

473
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,001
Then we'll have to put a bullet in him.

474
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,290
N0.

475
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,050
We can't kill DEA agents.

476
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,088
Oh, no? Why not?

477
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,726
If it were up to me,
I'd feed him to the crocodiles.

[Fidel]
Berna, look...

479
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:40,565
Schedule a meeting with Pefia,
just as you have been.

480
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,405
We'll take care of the rest.

What is this?

488
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,730
Just a friendly chat.

489
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,206
You're making some very scary people
pretty nervous, Javier.

490
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,401
Which puts me in a spot because...

491
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,450
I'm the one who suggested
they approach you in the first place.

492
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,320
Now, I don't know what you know
about what it is I do,

493
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,323
but understand this:

494
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,882
I have our nation's
long-term interests in mind.

495
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,962
That's the beat I walk.

496
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,442
And sitting here tonight,
that means making sure the right folks

497
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,888
are left standing when Escobar
gets his bullet.

498
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,642
So do Uncle Sam a solid.

499
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,403
Don't complicate that.

500
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,049
These folks are prone
to emotional decision-making.

501
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:10,165
Which can lead to bush league nonsense
like... killing a federal agent.

502
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,849
By the way, they found the lawyer.

503

514
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,171
[Trujillo]
I'll catch up. Everything's fine.

515
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,250
What's going on, Pefia?

Did you see what they did to his son'?

518
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,921
How many families has Pablo Escobar
destroyed, Pefia? Do you know?

519
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,086
You don't decide who lives and who dies.

520
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,290
Don't be fucking stupid.
This is how we do it.

Let's make something clear:

00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,648
If you've come to plead for them
as part of some deal, the only...

525
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,484
No, Mr. President.

526
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:24,363
I haven't come to plead for them.
I've come to plead for you.

527
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,647
For me? How so?

528
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,884
I know that you want Escobar dead.

529
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,369
And while I don't agree with that,
I understand it.

530
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:42,604
But this... this I can't understand.

531

This isn't just wrong.

532
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:53,604
It puts you, the president of Colombia,
in league with a death squad.

533
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,201
Call the German chancellor.
Tell him to let the family in.
