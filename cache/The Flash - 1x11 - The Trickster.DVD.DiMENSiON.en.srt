1
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,713
Barry, it's Megan. L...

2
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:21,513
<i>Hi, this is Barry. I'm out running around.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

3
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,121
Damn it, Barry. It's Megan.

4
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,553
If you're there,
please pick up the phone.

5
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:28,250
I'm in Willow Haven
and I need help fast.

6
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:38,096
I can't believe you've never
seen <i>The Philadelphia Story</i>.

7
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:41,570
Well, between my dad and my brother,
I grew up watching Westerns.

8
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,174
There are no six-shooters here.

9
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:46,710
You have Katharine Hepburn choosing
between Gary Grant and Jimmy Stewart.

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,905
Wow, that sounds action-packed, huh?

11
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,016
It depends
on what you call action-packed.

12
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:54,381
Intense fleeting passion
or complex but true love.

13
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:58,217
Look, I just hope there's a cartoon
with it, all right? Where is that remote?

14
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,619
Oh, no.

15
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,523
I hope it's not the office.

16
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,092
<i>Damn it, Barry. It's Megan.</i>

17
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:10,202
<i>I need help.</i>
<i>I'm in Willow Haven. Please. Fast.</i>

18
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,304
- Megan Lockhart?
- The detective?

19
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,702
But I thought she left Central.

20
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,108
Willow Haven's a resort town
north of here, right?

21
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,038
- I gotta go.
- It's 150 miles from here.

22
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,341
I know, I've never done
that distance before.

23
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,780
I don't wanna be a broken record,
but you can't...

24
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:28,614
I know, I know, I know.
I'm risking muscle fatigue...

25
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:32,451
...dehydration, blackouts.
You heard the message.

26
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,890
Start without me.
I'll be back.

27
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,434
Well, I guess
it's just you and me, Earl.

28
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,496
Popcorn?

29
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:50,576
Prepare to be amazed,
ladies and gentlemen.

30
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,250
I am James Montgomery Jesse.

31
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:08,759
Welcome to my World of Illusion
Wonder Show.

32
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:15,725
You're such a lovely audience.
Don't be shy.

33
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,928
Give yourself
a huge round of applause.

34
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,802
You're too kind.

35
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,171
<i>Hey, you call that an act?</i>
<i>You stink!</i>

36
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,406
A disbeliever?

37
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:32,176
See if you can figure out
how this works.

38
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,755
And now...

39
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:43,453
- Something you've all been waiting for.
- What are you doing? Help me. Help!

40
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,461
Let me out of here!

41
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:49,361
Other prestidigitators
may give you the illusion...

42
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,868
...of sawing a woman in half.

43
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,872
You're crazy!

44
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,139
But there's no substitute
for the real thing.

45
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,946
Can't we talk about this?

46
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:22,754
Darling, you're acting like we haven't
done this a thousand times before.

47
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,897
- Trust me.
- Go to hell.

48
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:30,527
Watch your language.
This is a family show.

49
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,973
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
before your very eyes...

50
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:41,273
...I shall cut
my lovely assistant in twain.

51
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:42,503
What?

52
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,274
No!

53
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,622
Who the hell are you?

54
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,472
Thanks, Red. I needed that.

55
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,700
This is my show. My show!

56
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,541
A disappearing act, huh?

57
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,377
I gotta learn how to do that.

58
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:47,742
I warn you.
I've mastered all of Houdini's secrets.

59
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,109
Oh, put a sock in it.

60
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,313
I'm glad you got my message.

61
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,254
Are you okay?

62
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,588
Wiped out.

63
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,926
How did you get involved with...

64
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,789
..."Mandrake" here?

65
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,453
Routine repo job.

66
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,156
His name's James Jesse.
Like Jesse James...

67
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,666
...only backwards and twisted.

68
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,830
I followed him across state lines, and he
turns the tables and starts chasing me.

69
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:19,068
I thought I lost him on the back roads
and then he set up a trap for me here.

70
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,703
How was I supposed to know
he was a homicidal maniac?

71
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:29,087
The mustache and beard are real.

72
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,450
So I lied.

73
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,890
I've gotta tell you, I'm impressed.

74
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,927
It took real guts
to take this guy down.

75
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,462
It was nothing, really.

76
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,100
Martial arts training
and a lot of street fighting.

77
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:45,465
Well, you hit the jackpot with this bird.
He's been tough to track.

78
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,799
He's got more personalities
than a variety show.

79
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,805
He's wanted for murder
in five states.

80
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,967
That's six states.

81
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,874
She didn't stop me.

82
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:58,983
- It was that Flash thing.
- Yeah, right. And I'm Bugs Bunny.

83
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,981
Are you sure you're all right, ma'am?
You don't need an escort?

84
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:10,284
No, I'm fine, really.
I've got a guardian angel.

85
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,429
Come on, Williams. The lady's
had a rough night already.

86
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,199
Megan.

87
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:23,565
You've won my heart.
You're aggressive, persistent, tough.

88
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,904
Everything I admire in a woman.

89
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:29,809
You hear me? I love you.

90
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,778
- Please. You've got to believe me.
- Let's get out of here.

91
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,112
Megan, I love you.

92
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,720
I love you!

93
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,722
Cold?

94
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,327
I hope they lock
that guy away for good.

95
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,954
Did you see his eyes?
They were like tiny black holes.

96
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,466
Listen, I really don't think I'm up
for the trek back to Central City.

97
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,433
Can you give me a lift?

98
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,403
In that red suit, honey,
you're riding in back.

99
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,803
Wait here.

100
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,776
- What do you think?
- Very snazzy.

101
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,217
I'm sorry I didn't wear
my clam diggers.

102
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,019
Oh, man.

103
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,718
I guess I wasn't quite ready
for hyper speed, huh?

104
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,763
I'll tell you what.
We'll stop off at the Moo and Brew.

105
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:22,264
- All you can eat for 4.99.
- Yeah?

106
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:23,663
- Yeah.
- Sounds like heaven.

107
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,235
Let's go.

108
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,700
- You can do that at high speed?
- Lf I have to.

109
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,901
Oh, it makes my life
sound pretty dull.

110
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,943
Oh, you're right. Like tonight, huh?

111
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,911
- Okay, you got me.
- Tina's sleeping.

112
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,046
No, no, no. Don't worry.
Don't worry. I'm awake.

113
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:41,978
Megan's with you.

114
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,686
Oh, of course.
Did everything turn out all right?

115
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:49,650
Well, let's just say if not for Barry,
I'd be beside myself.

116
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,729
What are you wearing?

117
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,163
I'll explain in the morning.

118
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,765
Speaking of morning,
I have an early appointment.

119
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,337
Yeah. Barry mentioned to me
what happens to you...

120
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,474
...when you don't get enough sleep.

121
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,577
- All-girl gang, huh?
- You told her about that?

122
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,804
Well, yeah.

123
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,842
I brought her up to date.

124
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:16,780
Besides you, she is the only one
who knows I'm the Flash. So...

125
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,824
Well, I guess I can't be the only one.

126
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,230
Listen, I'll make some tea
and the three of us...

127
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,390
...can sit down and catch up.
- Great idea.

128
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,833
I've gotta hit the road.
Megan, if you're looking for a hotel...

129
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,495
...the Ritz on 2nd Street
has phenomenal room service.

130
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:38,337
No. You're staying here, all right?
I got plenty of room right here.

131
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,668
- Great.
- Yeah.

132
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,906
- Well, nice seeing you again, Megan.
- Same here, McGee.

133
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:50,049
Tina, listen, one more time,
I'm really sorry about tonight.

134
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,884
Don't worry about it, Barry,
I'll call you in the morning.

135
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,549
Okay.

136
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,994
- I am wasted.
- Oh, yeah.

137
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,639
Definitely time for bed.

138
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,577
I mean, you take the bedroom.

139
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,375
- I'll camp down here with Earl.
- Forget it, Barry.

140
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,884
You've had one hellish night. I don't
wanna impose any more than I have.

141
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,990
No, no. Come on, get up, get up.
Before I change my mind.

142
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,422
If the Scouts found out
I put you on the couch...

143
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:32,189
...they'd take back my merit badges,
and my red suit.

144
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,061
Well, we couldn't
have that now, could we?

145
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,996
You know, Barry, not only
are you fast, but you're nice.

146
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,838
Nice?

147
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:46,406
Thanks for saving my life yet again.

148
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,212
- Good night.
- Good night.

149
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,455
We could meet halfway.

150
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,559
I thought you were tired.

151
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,433
Exhausted.

152
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,570
Yeah, me too.

153
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,618
Wait a minute.

154
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,346
It isn't over yet, is it?

155
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,683
Not a chance.

156
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:47,424
A red costume,
with that lightning-bolt insignia...

157
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,295
...signifying his dark power.

158
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,436
- Will you listen to him?
- I can't believe we gotta haul him...

159
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,072
...all the way to state lockup.

160
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,265
To hell with that.
Take me to Central City.

161
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,876
That's where this Flash lives, right?

162
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,012
Yeah, there's no justice.

163
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:06,108
He stole the only woman
I ever loved from me.

164
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,413
That's because you murdered
the other 12 only women you ever loved.

165
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,049
Flash.

166
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:17,594
He kidnapped her, brainwashed her
with his black science.

167
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,331
There's only one man
who can stop the Flash.

168
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,326
Hey, hey, hey!

169
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:37,443
There's only one man who can rescue
my faithful companion, Megan Lockhart...

170
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:41,450
...from the Flash's evil clutches.
And I am that man.

171
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,917
Move over.

172
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,318
I'm driving.

173
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,572
I like it.

174
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,798
Leased?

175
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:30,900
You took her from me,
red demon. Brainwashed her.

176
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,903
All to make her forget her one true love.

177
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:37,304
But no matter what you do,
no matter where you run...

178
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:40,104
...you won't keep Megan Lockhart
from my side...

179
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:44,739
...because, my dear Flash,
you may have defeated James Jesse...

180
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,579
...but you'll never defeat...

181
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,581
...The Trickster.

182
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,658
When our corrupt DA friend
used me to blackmail you...

183
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:02,164
...I figured I had some thinking to do
so I ended up in L. A...

184
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,235
...and came to a few realizations.
- Yeah, like what?

185
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:11,073
Like, one, I hate anyone who uses
the word "dude" in a sentence.

186
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,441
And, two, sitting around
doing nothing makes me totally insane.

187
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,548
So you started doing repo work, right?

188
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,377
To pass the time.

189
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,678
The thrill, the adrenaline rush.

190
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,620
I know all about that.

191
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,518
Oh, I know you do.

192
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:36,727
So should I call the chapped-lip squad,
or would you two prefer to be alone?

193
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,097
Don't you have a morning
of your own to ruin?

194
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,432
Julio Mendez, Megan Lockhart.

195
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,074
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you doing?

196
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,938
Just picked up my costume
for the policemen's ball.

197
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,271
Are you gonna make it?

198
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,279
- Hey, you know...?
- I may not be in town that long.

199
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,917
Will you excuse us for a moment, please?

200
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,850
Okay, let me get this straight.

201
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,687
Last night it's Tina.

202
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,419
This morning it's this hot chick.

203
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,860
What's going on?
What are you, Barry's evil twin?

204
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:10,468
Only that haircut would cover
your filthy mind.

205
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,264
Well, things are...
Things are happening.

206
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,737
- They're happening?
- Yeah.

207
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:19,074
Well, don't look now,
but things are really happening.

208
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,608
- Hey, guys.
- Tina.

209
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,921
My turn to buy muffins
and croissants for the office.

210
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,719
Yeah, listen. Again,
I'm really sorry about last night.

211
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,157
Oh, don't worry, Barry. I understand.

212
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,662
Anyway, we still have
the police costume ball Saturday night.

213
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,733
- We do?
- Yeah, did you forget?

214
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,802
No, no. Well, yeah, kind of.

215
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:50,999
Well, you know, Megan's in town,
and I thought that, well, maybe...

216
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,168
Well, maybe we could
make it a foursome.

217
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,473
- How about Gibson from Cybernetics?
- Gibson?

218
00:16:56,648 --> 00:17:00,209
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that would make four of us.

219
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,785
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

220
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:05,947
No, he's not right for Megan.
No, listen, you two go alone.

221
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,787
I really don't want to leave you
stuck on a Saturday.

222
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,328
Don't worry, Barry. It's no big deal.
Saturday was iffy at best.

223
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,261
- Lffy.
- Yeah.

224
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:18,130
- Okay, if you're sure it's all right.
- Listen, I gotta run.

225
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:22,137
- Have a great time. Okay, bye.
- Bye.

226
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,434
Hey, you forgot your...

227
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,271
...croissant.

228
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,715
I hate to kick a man when he's doing
a good job of it himself.

229
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,786
Although this is your day off,
there's a stack of test results.

230
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:39,788
- They need your signature.
- Swell.

231
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:47,231
That's good. A little bit to the right.

232
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,062
- And can you raise it up about an inch?
- Will you stop, please!

233
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,999
- Murph, come on. Come on.
- What?

234
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,332
You can tell me.

235
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,531
Just when I thought
the lobotomy was working.

236
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:00,144
How many ways can you misspell
"lead perpetrator" on one page?

237
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,439
Come on. Let's drop these
on Garfield's desk.

238
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,479
We have the rest of the day
to ourselves.

239
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,710
Barry. Barry.
You have got to hear this one, man.

240
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,753
- You've gotta hear this. Now...
- Officers Murphy and Bellows.

241
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,481
- Megan Lockhart.
- I remember you.

242
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,786
- Last year at the company fire, wasn't it?
- How could I forget?

243
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,360
- Pleasure.
- Yeah, same here.

244
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,464
Barry, wait till you hear this.
Okay, Sherlock, Jr., here...

245
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:24,432
...every time he sees the Flash it's
without me. Now he thinks I'm the Flash.

246
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:28,603
Murphy is always out of sight
whenever the Flash shows up.

247
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,503
I made a chart.

248
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,971
Okay, Flash sightings cross-indexed
with Officer Murphy's patrol log?

249
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,209
- It's very interesting.
- I rest my case.

250
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:43,149
Pure speculation, Your Honor.
Pure speculation.

251
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:46,587
Well, now, Murph, it does seem
that you do protest too much.

252
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:51,127
You know, I saw the Flash once
and I must say it is very close.

253
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,459
- Those steely eyes.
- Yeah.

254
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,394
Officer Murphy,
I am proud to work with you.

255
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,402
- And your secret is safe with all of us.
- Oh, boy. You know...

256
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,699
...I would love
to have you guys as witnesses.

257
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,809
Perkins, Crenshaw.

258
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,413
We've got a double homicide
at the Desoto Exit on 61.

259
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,979
What's up, lieutenant?

260
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,915
Well, some psycho named James Jesse.

261
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,179
He killed two state troopers last night...

262
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:19,813
...and dumped the bodies
in the city limits. Those for me?

263
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,859
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you.

264
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,321
There's...

265
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:30,466
...a billion in one chance that
he could be in Central City.

266
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,105
No. He's miles away from here.

267
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,997
I know you're right.

268
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,542
He has no reason at all
to believe that I'm here.

269
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,737
- No.
- I mean none. No reason at all.

270
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,378
Sure.

271
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:49,213
In my darkest hours, a raid
against my greatest foes.

272
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,522
You always stood by me, Frank.

273
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,683
Ever my faithful
and trustworthy sidekick.

274
00:19:56,828 --> 00:20:01,197
What do you think?
"Oh, Trickster, it's beautiful.

275
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,392
Right now I'm not feeling too beautiful.

276
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,204
Because my mind is clouded
by the Flash's hypnotic powers."

277
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,673
The fiend! But don't fret.

278
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:18,407
I'll fight to win you back,
even if I have to lay the city to waste.

279
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:23,954
"Oh, Trickster, I love you."
And I you.

280
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:26,590
With all my heart.

281
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,326
To The Trickster-mobile!

282
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:43,731
I've been on my own since I was 15,
standing up to wise guys and pimps.

283
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,538
I can't kick this feeling of dread.

284
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,942
He's got me running for my life.

285
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,778
Crooks I understand.
But this guy is nuts.

286
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,011
And he thinks he's in love with me.

287
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,315
So I'll take care of you.

288
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,117
You can't be around all the time.

289
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,752
And I'm not big on other people
fighting my own battles.

290
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,044
I don't like the looks of this.

291
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,115
Citizens of Central City!

292
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,549
I am The Trickster, here to rescue you...

293
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,520
...from the menace known as the Flash.

294
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:39,256
And to save the darling of my heart
from his fiendish affections.

295
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:42,161
Ta-ta for now.

296
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,937
Barry, that voice.

297
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,802
It's Jesse.

298
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,035
- I'm going after him.
- Wait.

299
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,701
Look.

300
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,937
The finance company hired me
because Jesse missed his car payments.

301
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:33,141
And now he's got this fatal attraction
thing for you and the Flash. Great.

302
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:36,253
He's wanted for murder in six states
under six different names.

303
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,015
According to the FBI,
James Jesse's a role player.

304
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,819
A doctor in Seattle,
a lawyer in Des Moines.

305
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,358
A magician in Willow Haven.

306
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,589
A costumed clown running rampant
in my town? What next?

307
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,599
It's like the Flash draws them
out of the woodwork.

308
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,202
Wait a minute.

309
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,397
You think the Flash
is responsible for The Trickster?

310
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:59,766
Circus suit, high media profile,
works outside the law.

311
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:04,075
Every loon in a three-mile radius
has gotta have a case of costume envy.

312
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,881
Is Garfield right?
Am I responsible for The Trickster?

313
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,855
- How could you be?
- No, wait a minute.

314
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,494
Since I became the Flash,
these eccentric criminals...

315
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:21,291
...have been coming out of the woodwork.
The Trackman, Ghost, Gideon, now this.

316
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,993
- Maybe I should hang it up.
- Stop blaming yourself.

317
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,365
Blame society.

318
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,437
Welcome to post-modern America.

319
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:34,339
Trickster's taken hostages
at Hecksapoppins.

320
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,475
Don't worry.
I'm sure Murphy's on the case.

321
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:43,648
I've gotta get this guy
off my case once and for all.

322
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:46,222
Not by yourself, you don't.

323
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,310
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

324
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,441
Roman candles...

325
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,345
Yes. Yes, yes.

326
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:17,782
Itching powder. Good, good, good.

327
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,750
Vanishing cream.

328
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:25,829
Oh, this is one terrific escape tool,
let me tell you.

329
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,090
Let's see...

330
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,757
X-ray specs.

331
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,035
Total fraud.

332
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,073
No one's singing.

333
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:43,271
And we know what happens
when we don't sing, don't we?

334
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:48,181
When your love is stolen from you...

335
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,585
...like that Flash stole mine...

336
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:55,157
...you've gotta do everything you can
to win her back, right?

337
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,020
Right?!

338
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,561
What do you know about love?

339
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,426
Honey bun.

340
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:07,001
You're still under his power,
aren't you?

341
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,604
Let them go, Jesse.

342
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,869
It's over.

343
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,542
Do I have to kill him to prove my love?

344
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,375
I hate it when he does that.

345
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,015
Are you okay?

346
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:05,355
- I think I tore my knee.
- Oh, brother. Come on.

347
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,500
Marbles.

348
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,158
That laugh.

349
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:14,066
But not for the dead body in there.

350
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,179
Sorry to ruin your evening, Tina.

351
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,815
Oh, I'm sorry, did that sting?

352
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,917
Maybe that's why I screamed in agony.

353
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,575
Here, next time bite on this.

354
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:33,281
With your healing metabolism and this
salve, you'll be fine in a few hours.

355
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,791
What a deal. I wish I had
that kind of medical coverage.

356
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:39,658
Thanks a lot, Tina.
I'm glad you were in the lab.

357
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,493
Well, it's not like
I had much of a social calendar.

358
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,894
Look, I'm really sorry to have gotten you
both involved in this.

359
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,734
What? Don't be silly.

360
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,468
If Jesse didn't see the Flash
as a threat to his ego...

361
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:55,169
...he wouldn't give Central City hell
as The Trickster.

362
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,282
Yeah, but that man in the novelty shop
died because of me.

363
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,885
Look, the question is,
how are we gonna stop him?

364
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,419
- We?
- Yes. That's how it works, isn't it?

365
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,489
You work the streets and I work the lab.

366
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,252
I got used to troubleshooting
Central City. I enjoy it.

367
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,292
Unless you've got
a giant whoopee cushion...

368
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,488
...I don't think Star Labs
is up to this one.

369
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,395
What's next? A high-speed
search of the city, what?

370
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:20,368
I think you should let that leg heal
and I will do my own work.

371
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:24,907
- What? It's the Flash Jesse's after.
- Because of me.

372
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,601
I'm no damsel in distress.
I'm a detective.

373
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,713
I found you out and I can find Jesse.

374
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:33,009
- But...
- I'll call you later.

375
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:40,151
Now, what's she trying to prove?

376
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,158
Maybe you should ask yourself
the same question.

377
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,587
What's that supposed to mean?

378
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:51,298
You can't be a knight in shining red armor
for everybody, every day.

379
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,869
Now I have to go too.
I don't live here, you know.

380
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,880
- No line on the explosives?
- <i>No</i>.

381
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,346
Okay, what about the statue?

382
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,611
- <i>Freddy Mercury</i>?
- Not Freddy Mercury. The god of speed.

383
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:11,722
- Where would I get that?
- <i>How about a theatrical warehouse?</i>

384
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,586
- A theatrical warehouse. Right.
- <i>There's a couple dozen</i>.

385
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,989
- How many?
- <i>You heard me.</i>

386
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,357
Give me all of them,
even the closed ones.

387
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,061
Come on.

388
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:31,731
Come on, come on.
What is the matter with you?

389
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,468
You okay, Bar?

390
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,613
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I'm great.

391
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,238
- Hey, have a chip.
- No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

392
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,009
Now I am worried. What's up, man?

393
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:44,587
Oh, I'm just trying to access
interstate files on James Jesse.

394
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,316
Come on, what's really going on, Barry?

395
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:53,556
Ever since Megan came back to town,
my life has been nuts.

396
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,097
And now Tina's acting like...

397
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,928
Oh, I see. Why didn't you tell me
it was about babes, man?

398
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,230
I don't have any idea
what they want from me.

399
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,136
Okay, okay. Let Dr. Love Thing
set you straight, all right?

400
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,868
You're not supposed to have any idea.
But look at it this way, man.

401
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,778
At least you're not sublimating
your sex drive with food anymore, right?

402
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,614
- Barry Allen?
- Yeah.

403
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,123
Bob Endicott, FBI.

404
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:25,151
I'm on the James Jesse case.

405
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,265
Your chief tells me
you're attached to the investigation.

406
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,561
Yeah, I was just going over
the files from your office.

407
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,704
- This Jesse is a real character.
- I'll say.

408
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:37,433
He's the most brilliant criminal mind
I've ever chased across 12 states.

409
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,702
They don't even have
the San Antonio incident.

410
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,403
The guy was nearly elected mayor in '88.

411
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,608
Let's get down to brass tacks.

412
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,945
We're extremely concerned
about Miss Lockhart...

413
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,349
...and prepared to put her
under federal protection.

414
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,546
I'm not sure she wants protection.

415
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,420
She's staying with me
so you can talk to her if you want.

416
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,424
- Sir, what's up?
- It's The Trickster.

417
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:01,326
He's left another love letter for your
girlfriend by Parkhurst Alley.

418
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:03,091
Girlfriend.

419
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,944
Jesse, you are one sick pup.

420
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,786
Stand back. Stand back.
Hey, get down.

421
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,056
We've already got some burn victims.

422
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:37,827
The lunatic's in the truck
and I want the bomb squad here now!

423
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,537
Now.

424
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:46,504
Hey, watch out for that yo-yo in the car.
He may have accomplices.

425
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,246
Go ahead, Murph. Change
into your outfit. I won't tell anybody.

426
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:53,782
Will you stop with that long enough
so we can take care of The Trickster?

427
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,648
It hurts me that you don't feel
you can trust me.

428
00:30:56,988 --> 00:31:00,719
Bellows, if I hear one more word
about this "I'm the Flash" stuff, I'll...

429
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:04,985
You'll what, Murph?

430
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,253
What?

431
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,268
Your secret's safe with me, pal.

432
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,323
- Take it easy. Come on.
- Megan?

433
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,798
She's not here, Allen.

434
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,402
Down, Earl. He's a fed.

435
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,138
Although I'm not exactly sure
why he's here.

436
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:54,244
Well, I wanted to talk,
and your door was open.

437
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,006
Listen, you got a message
on your machine.

438
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,053
<i>Barry, I found Jesse's hideout.</i>

439
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:11,025
<i>It's the old Agitprop Theatrical</i>
<i>Warehouse on Margo Lane.</i>

440
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:14,494
- I'm sure she's in danger.
- Then let's go.

441
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,734
I don't like this one bit, Allen.
She shouldn't be here.

442
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,971
She can take care of herself, Endicott.

443
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,810
- Barry?
- What did I tell you? Megan, over here.

444
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,475
Oh, I'm glad you could make it.

445
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,988
- Who's that with you?
- This is Federal Agent Endicott.

446
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:43,685
- Federal agent, like hell!
- Sweet dreams, Allen.

447
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:48,662
- Jesse!
- Still under the mind control of the Flash.

448
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,461
I'd hoped my fireworks display
would distract him...

449
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,934
...long enough to break the spell.

450
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,670
Don't move, scum.

451
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:04,105
First the Flash, now this guy.

452
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:07,774
How many rivals must I tolerate?

453
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:29,868
I ask so little of you,
my faithless companion.

454
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,338
Jesse, don't.

455
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,444
- Maybe we just need counseling.
- As my loyal sidekick...

456
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:37,137
...you have room
for but one man in your life.

457
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,749
Okay, I'll be your sidekick.
Just let him go.

458
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,714
I don't love him or the Flash.

459
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:43,979
- Do you love me?
- Yes, I love you.

460
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,589
- And you hate him?
- He means nothing to me.

461
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,520
Then let's kill him.

462
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,288
Barry!

463
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:37,196
Let him out!

464
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,043
- Who's there?
- It's me.

465
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,011
What happened to you?

466
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,207
I just got an impromptu dip
in The Trickster's aquarium.

467
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,113
I'll be right back.

468
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:28,656
- But what about Megan?
- Jesse's got her. They could be anywhere.

469
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:31,886
- We've got to do something.
- But I don't even know where to start.

470
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,088
Trickster thinks
she's his costumed sidekick.

471
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,860
- So he probably hasn't hurt her. Yet.
- Well, I hope to God you're right.

472
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:42,436
- I'm glad to see you're so concerned.
- Oh, come on, Barry. I like Megan.

473
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,598
Before she came along,
I was the only one...

474
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:47,642
...that knew you were the Flash.
It was our secret.

475
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,905
If things are starting
to happen between you...

476
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,810
Hey, hey, hey. Listen.

477
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:56,044
Whatever happens, it's not gonna get
in the way of our friendship.

478
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,250
I know that.

479
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,151
I guess I just wanted
to hear you say it.

480
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:05,922
Now, we've got to think logically.
How do we handle The Trickster?

481
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,462
That's it. That's it.

482
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:14,332
What we have to do is not think logically.

483
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:18,039
Play The Trickster's game
right back at him.

484
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,848
I'm gonna call him out.

485
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,181
"The Flash challenges The Trickster
to a clash of titans.

486
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,789
Infintina Hotel tonight."

487
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,721
In the middle of
a police costume ball?

488
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:39,056
The Trickster's ego is way
out of control. I'm sure he'll show.

489
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,631
And I couldn't assemble
more cops in one place if I tried.

490
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,869
What's that about
my not saving the world every day...

491
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,902
...in my bright and shiny red armor?

492
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:51,007
Sometimes you're the exception
that proves the rule.

493
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:58,680
Well, call me if you hear
anything from Murph, huh?

494
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,646
Ten-four and out.

495
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,525
"The Flash challenges The Trickster."

496
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:15,962
Wow! What a great idea, Murph.

497
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:18,397
Damn it, Bellows.
Didn't you hear me?

498
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:22,130
Wow. The system takes a real beating
being the Flash, huh? Look at you.

499
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:26,766
I was strung up by a noose back there.
Then I was sucker-punched by a...

500
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,206
Forget it.

501
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,578
We gotta pick up the ladies
and go to that costume party.

502
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,015
- Boy, do I need a drink.
- Anything you say, Murph.

503
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:44,394
Can you believe the nerve of this guy?

504
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,829
Oh, he's alive.

505
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:51,162
Though we are sworn enemies, Prank,
the Flash fears and respects my power.

506
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:54,202
And needs the might of the Central City
police to back him up.

507
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:58,271
I am not Prank, and this is not
some Saturday morning cartoon.

508
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,377
I will kill the Flash...

509
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:05,709
...freeing you from
his mental enslavement once and for all.

510
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:11,013
And then,
my dearest, sweetest Prank...

511
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:14,624
...we can really get down
and celebrate our long-delayed...

512
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,751
...but eagerly awaited honeymoon.

513
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,503
Lieutenant, Arthur Klein,
<i>Nightside News</i>.

514
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:33,337
Can we get a comment
on the impending confrontation...

515
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:36,605
...between Central City's
costumed citizens?

516
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,079
This is no joke, Klein.
People could get hurt.

517
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,480
How come you guys
are always looking for trouble?

518
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,587
Why not pump
the good cause behind this shindig?

519
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,985
Because we know
you would've sold more tickets...

520
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,750
...if you announced the main event.

521
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:51,360
Come on, lieutenant,
who's the odds-on favorite?

522
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,292
The Flash or The Trickster?

523
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,989
I've got heavily armed men
positioned around this hall.

524
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,795
If those maniacs think
they're gonna crash this party...

525
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,630
...they got another think coming.

526
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,705
- Hey, look, it's the Flash.
- Where?

527
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,414
Murph, what are you doing?

528
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:18,248
I can no longer live a lie, Bellows.

529
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:21,550
That's right, Mr. And Mrs. America,
and all the ships at sea.

530
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:25,184
Michael Frances Murphy is the Flash.

531
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:31,333
Officer Murphy, please remember
that you are a policeman.

532
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:35,233
- Yes, sir. It was a joke, sir.
- I have no sense of humor tonight.

533
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:07,128
That's brilliant, man. No one
will ever believe you're the Flash.

534
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:09,238
Can I ask you
a serious question, Bellows?

535
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,432
Did your wonder horse
kick you in the head?

536
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:12,871
Wonder horse?

537
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:16,035
- That's a nice outfit, man.
- Thank you very much, Mendez.

538
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:19,273
Unique and original too.
You're only number 11.

539
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,877
Remember, my dear.
Try not to breathe.

540
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:25,982
And now for our final conflict,
you crimson miscreant.

541
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,846
Your days in Central City
are numbered.

542
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:33,581
- I'm not the Flash, you dipstick.
- A decoy? Pathetic.

543
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:37,193
- Nobody tricks The Trickster.
- We need some air out here.

544
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,434
Something stinks.

545
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:55,074
I knew you were coming,
so I baked a cake.

546
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,358
Don't know my own strength.

547
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:17,197
And now here's something
we hope you'll really like.

548
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:41,322
- You slime dog!
- Now I get it.

549
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:44,893
This isn't the real Prank.
You substituted a robot in her place.

550
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,828
I can cut her and she won't bleed.
I double dare you.

551
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:50,796
Enough!

552
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,227
I'm sick of this cartoon crap.

553
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:02,806
Magic's never been my strong suit.

554
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,407
But juggling is a snap.

555
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,833
That's all, folks.

556
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,936
What's the matter with you?
You'll regret this.

557
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,807
Put that masked maniac in there.
Get him out of here.

558
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,915
- I don't know, Murph.
- Get out of here.

559
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:41,051
I feel like a fool.

560
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,654
I saw you and the Flash
in the same room.

561
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,687
What? Where?

562
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,553
He collared The Trickster.
Don't tell me you didn't see it.

563
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,752
- All that tear gas, I couldn't see a thing.
- Oh, that figures.

564
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,091
Well, anyway, you can't be him.

565
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:56,493
Okay, but...

566
00:43:56,667 --> 00:44:00,831
...if the Flash is so fast, why couldn't
he be in two places at once?

567
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:08,278
That's my costume. I'm the Flash.

568
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:10,709
Won't somebody listen to me?
I'm the Flash.

569
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,347
You morons.

570
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:16,418
I'm the Flash!

571
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:19,385
This never should have happened.

572
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:23,788
Barry, The Trickster wasn't your fault
any more than he was mine.

573
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:26,926
Hey, maybe you
were struck by lightning...

574
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:29,964
...so you could stop people like that.
- And maybe not.

575
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:31,692
Well, look at it this way.

576
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,497
It's a dirty job, but, hey,
at least you got the suit.

577
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,003
Yeah, swell.

578
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,837
Life is so weird.

579
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:43,469
Are you ready to go home?

580
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:45,248
We gotta talk.

581
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,616
Talk?

582
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:50,083
Barry, I really like you.

583
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:54,213
- More than a lot. More than I want to.
- Yeah, well, I'm crazy about you.

584
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:57,258
I know. And it scares me to death.

585
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,794
- I gotta go.
- No, you don't.

586
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:03,194
Trust me on this one, Barry.
A year ago I would have stuck around.

587
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,528
Then one day you'd wake up
and I would be gone.

588
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,137
- And I can't do that to you.
- Well, don't, okay?

589
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:09,795
Don't do that to me.

590
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,610
I'll write you from San Francisco.

591
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:19,048
How often?

592
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,917
Often enough to keep you interested.

593
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:27,618
Listen, let's go back to my apartment
and we'll talk about this, and...

594
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,727
Say goodbye at least?

595
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:35,293
- Okay.
- Okay.

596
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:39,633
I do have to change.
I mean, this harlequin bondage stuff...

597
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:42,931
...does not suit me.
- I don't know, I kind of like it.

598
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:44,540
You would.

599
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:51,142
Besides, I'm in the market for a sidekick.

600
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,112
"Flashette"?

601
