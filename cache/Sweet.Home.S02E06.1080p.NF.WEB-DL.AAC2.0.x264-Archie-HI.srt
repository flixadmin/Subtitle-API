Are you deaf or something?

171
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,495
You want me to go over it again?

172
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,748
Jun-il became a monster
without showing any of the symptoms.

173
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,666
So what?

174
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,710
So, he's a fringe case,
unlike any we've seen.

175
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,627
[sighs]

176
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,631
Monsterization is already
beyond our understanding.

177
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,596
When you dragged me out here,

178
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,765
and built me a fancy research facility,

179
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,393
I thought you might have
some grand design.

180
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,103
So what? It was all just an act?

181
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,398
You're only half correct.

182
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,485
So what have you been planning?

183
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,530
Let me in on the bigger picture here.

184
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,909
Why do you think I kept you alive, huh?

185
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,787
Because you represent hope.

186
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,790
Hope that humanity
hasn't thrown in the towel yet.

187
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,252
Hope that we may overcome this someday.

188
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,463
- Far from the truth.
- The truth is not what matters.

189
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,924
What matters is what people believe.

190
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,762
Don't shake their faith.

191
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,555
You don't want everything
to crumble, do you?

192

[flame whooshes]

[unsettling music]

195
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,302
[Yi-kyung] Get in.

196
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,346
I came out to find him.

197
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,558
Aren't you coming?

198
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,310
I'm not going anywhere until I find him.

199
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,313
Then why did you go there?

200
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,775
Why did you go where there are people?

201
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,364
[sighs]

202
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,546
[pedals creaking]

Don't.

[suspenseful music]

[Chief Ji]
Has it already been over a month?

211
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,510
Just hang in there.

212
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,096
We're almost there.

213
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,806
[Ye-seul] Mom?

214
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,435
Mom?

215
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,396
Did you sleep here?

216
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,357
I can tell from your face
you didn't sleep well.

217
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,070
What are your hands for?

218
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,405
Are they just for makeup?

219
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,824
Why didn't you knock?
What are you doing here?

220
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:32,741
I just…

221
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,411
I was just worried. I'm looking for you.

222
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,789
You can enter my room, but not here, okay?

223
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,750
That's a warning.

224
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,877
I'm serious.

225
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:46,630
Mm-hmm.

226
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,550
Go.

227
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,801
It's time for roll call.

228
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,138
[alarm chimes]

<i>The infectee was monsterized last night,
and the Crow Platoon subdued her.</i>

<i>Please do not be alarmed
and prepare for roll call.</i>

<i>That'll be all.</i>

233
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,331
So, did you get her?

234
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,584
What?

235
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,379
- Yeah.
- Oh. [chuckles]

236
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:32,009
Seriously. We can all sleep safe and sound
all thanks to the platoon and all.

237
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,635
[chuckles nervously]

238
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,346
Is this really something
to get so psyched about?

239
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,307
Huh?

240
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,185
A person died.

241
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,062
[Seung-wan] Oh.

242
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,565
Uh, it was a monster, not a…
not a person, though.

243
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,025
[Seung-wan groans]

244
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,110
It's a fine line.

245
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,529
If this wound heals,
you'll end up becoming one of them.

246
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,658
Hey, let's go.

247
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,035
Right.

248
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,337
Shit.

249
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,506
Have you heard anything about this?
What was that all about?

250
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,423
No idea.

251
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,300
Maybe the guys on night shift
had a hand in it.

252
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,052
I doubt they would have kept it from us
if that was the case.

253
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,595
They love bragging about fresh kills.

254
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,680
Hey, if Sergeant Tak said it happened,
it happened.

255
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,099
It's not like he would make stuff up.

256
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,767
He could.

257
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,684
Hey.

258
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,062
Watch what you say, man.

259
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,856
Can't you see that we're being kept
out of the loop here, man?

260
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,652
I don't trust anyone
other than Sergeant Kim right now.

261
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,654
Well, now, you really hurt
my feelings, you prick.

262
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,322
- [Peter] Come confess your sins.
- Huh?

263
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,617
Nothing beats a good old confession

264
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,036
when you feel like talking
behind someone's back, after all.

265

[keys jangling]

266
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,139
What happened here?

267
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,184
We were supposed to let her go
this morning.

268
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,314
We were going to let her go
as soon as she saw Jun-il!

269
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,611
We don't exactly live in a world
where promises are kept.

270
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,823
[Chief Ji] The hell?

271
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,200
What happened?

272
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,996
What happened here? Damn it.

273
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,291
See this here?

274
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,209
This is Jun-il.

275
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,254
If I told you, would you believe me?

276
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,009
You said it yourself. You called me
the last person to be trusted.

277
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,343
[Dr. Lim chuckles]

278
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,097
You really do have
great insight, you know.

279
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,727
But why are you getting
so worked up over this?

280
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,729
You weren't even
all that close to her, no?

281
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,730
Right?

282
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,274
Huh?

283
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,152
Who am I even talking to?

[Seo-jin] <i>What, a girl?</i>

No.

288
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,955
Are you sure?

[sighs]

290
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,836
There's no way Yong-seok wouldn't have
told me, if that was the case.

291
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:18,008
Anyways, this means that
he didn't desert us just to run away.

292
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,635
In which case, we should go get him.

293
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,886
I'll get the boys.

294
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,473
- It hasn't been approved.
- Huh?

295
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,101
What do you mean?

296
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,396
I'm going to have a word
with Sergeant Tak.

297
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,731
- Hey, Seo-jin.
- [grunts]

298
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:33,732
[Seo-jin] What?

299
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,193
Don't tell me that you agree with him.

300
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,819
Of course not, we need to find Yong-seok.

301
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,029
So what's this about?

302
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,286
The Platoon only acts for the public good.

303
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,246
[scoffs]

304
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,247
Yong-seok didn't go missing.

305
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,582
He went AWOL from the unit all on his own.

306
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,419
As things stand, Yong-seok's case
is nothing more than a personal miss out.

307
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,712
So what, we just ditch him?

308
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,881
You said he'd be here.

309
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,759
You said we can return to find him, huh?

310
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,802
Hey!

311
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,096
I only returned because I believed
what you told me.

312
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,514
Had I known you'd pull this crap…

313
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,225
I would've stayed behind to look for him.

314
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,561
We could end up losing the rest of our men
if we go out in our current state.

315
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,439
And don't forget that Yong-seok
has the radio and the transmitter.

316
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,944
Let's talk about finding him
once we get a signal.

317
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,571
You're a goddamn coward.

318
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,950
How are you any different
from Sergeant Tak, hm?

319
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,623
- Fucking hell…

Park Chan-yeong is missing, sir.

That, and we ran into a problem
while calculating the roll call tally.

325
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,848
There must be an exit we don't know of.

00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,269
[Yeong-hu sighs]

327
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,356
Round up a group of survivors
and do a full sweep of the stadium.

328
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,983
Block off the exit once you find it.

329
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:58,984
Yes, sir.

330

Do Sang-jin, An Dong-gi, Lee Eun-yu,

331

and Park Chan-yeong are missing, sir.

332
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,205
Did they miss the roll call?

333
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,624
Yes, all four of them have gone missing.

334
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,378
Do Sang-jin and An Dong-gi held a grudge
for the expedition ban.

335
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,630
Lee Eun-yu likely left
because she fell on hard times.

336
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,258
Since the main gate wasn't opened,

337
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,052
there should be another exit.

338
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,345
Once we find it, we'll block it off.

339
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,263
I see. Do just that.

340
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,684
Find the exit, cooperate with Chief Ji
to block it off.

341
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,644
- Make sure to keep an eye on them.
- Yes, sir.

342
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,940
Are you just going to let
that bastard Chan-yeong be?

343
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,318
We can take disciplinary action
once he's back.

344
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,571
What's Min up to?

345
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,782
He won't leave the barracks, sir.

346
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,621
Round up the men
and look for an exit first.

347
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,206
[Seok-chan] Yes, sir.

348
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,711
You're Sergeant First Class Kim, right?

349
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,800
Please, sir…

350
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,260
find Yong-seok.

00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,671
Have you found it?

354
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,840
[In-hwan] We're still looking.

355
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,217
Then what business do you have here?

356
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,347
Hmm, three people
left the stadium yesterday.

357
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,143
Do you know where they might've gone
and why they escaped?

358
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,311
Are you accusing me of something?

359
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,479
I don't know.

360
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,605
I have no reason to.

361

[objects clank]

362
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,278
You said there was no other exit
aside from the main gate.

363
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,199
And now we're looking
for that nonexistent exit.

Master Sergeant Tak.

How many hours a day
do you monitor the cameras?

366
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,879
It seems you want to know anything
and everything that goes on around here,

367
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,840
but this desire to know everything
all on your own,

368
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,050
well, that's how dictatorships begin.

369
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,345
Not that you haven't gotten
started on that already.

[metals clanking]

371
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,811
Tell me, is there a word
for hoarding knowledge for oneself

372
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,229
while keeping others in the dark?

373
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,607
Putting everyone in danger?

374
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,904
I know you're an important figure
in this place, Chief.

375
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:49,988
However,

376
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,074
you can't just do
whatever you like, you know.

377
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,327
Are you threatening me?

378
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,996
Nope. Just requesting cooperation.

[Jin-guk] She's probably dead, right?

384
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,170
Who is?

385
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,756
The girl from that family.

386
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,719
[Gi-chun] Mm-hmm.

Aah, I'm talking about Lee Eun-yu.

Oh, well, you'll never know.

She's as tough as nails.

Ah, Jesus Christ,
they're causing us so much trouble.

Just pretend you're looking.

392
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,860
If the Crow Platoon can't find it,
how are we going to?

393
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,070
That reminds me.

394
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,864
I heard the Crow Platoon's
youngest member went missing.

395
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,867
Come to think of it.

396
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,287
It looked like, um,
they both knew each other.

397
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,413
Is that right?

398
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,580
Oh, well, then.

00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,666
Now that you mention it,

00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,960
there was something
about the way he looked at her.

- Oh. Could it be love?

Damn, crazy you can elope
in a world that's gone to crap.

00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,011
And why would they need to do that, huh?

405
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,306
No one said dating is forbidden
once you're in the Crow Platoon.

[laughs]

407
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,642
Yeah, you're right.

408

Guess that rules out the eloping theory.

with stupid-ass nonsense like this.

Chan-yeong and that crazy bitch?

did coincide--

it could have put the stadium at risk.

Why risk your life to protect the stadium?

You believe hiding
is the right thing to do.

So hide it.

the monster had gotten you and Mr. Kim.

But no.

it's a certain person, that's all.

You…

ran into people again?

Why did you do it?
Why did you do it again?

That's why I locked you up,
for your own sake!

So you should be thankful.

We're in trouble. We really are.

This won't keep us alive for long.

to get the hell out of here!

Come on, sir. Someone's going to hear you.

860

It's bad enough that people are calling
desertion our platoon's latest fad.

It's not like being here
is gonna win me any medal or something.

He's a Crow Platoon member,

You let him out of here.

You should've stopped him.
