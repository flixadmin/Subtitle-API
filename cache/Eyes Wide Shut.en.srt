1
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:04,628
Honey, have you seen my wallet?

2
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:08,340
Isn't it on the bedside table?

3
00:01:14,889 --> 00:01:17,391
Now listen, we're running a little late.

4
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,642
I know.

5
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:20,728
How do I look?

6
00:01:20,936 --> 00:01:22,396
Perfect.

7
00:01:22,646 --> 00:01:24,315
Is my hair okay?

8
00:01:24,774 --> 00:01:25,941
It's great.

9
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:28,235
You're not even looking at it.

10
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:30,905
It's beautiful.

11
00:01:31,363 --> 00:01:33,032
You always look beautiful.

12
00:01:33,532 --> 00:01:35,576
Did you give Roz the phone
and pager numbers?

13
00:01:35,785 --> 00:01:38,245
Yeah, I put it on the fridge. Let's go.

14
00:01:38,454 --> 00:01:39,497
Coming.

15
00:01:40,372 --> 00:01:41,916
All right.

16
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:43,376
I'm ready.

17
00:02:00,393 --> 00:02:02,103
What's the babysitter's name?

18
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,313
Roz.

19
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:08,652
Okay, Roz, we're going now.

20
00:02:09,236 --> 00:02:11,696
You look amazing, Mrs. Harford.

21
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:14,241
Thank you.
Helena, are you ready for bed?

22
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:17,077
Yes, Mommy. Can I stay up
and watch <i>The Nutcracker?</i>

23
00:02:17,327 --> 00:02:19,204
- What time's it on?
- 9:00.

24
00:02:19,454 --> 00:02:22,040
-You can watch that.
-Can I stay up until you get home?

25
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:25,335
- No, darling.
- It'll be a little late for that.

26
00:02:25,585 --> 00:02:27,796
The phone number is on the fridge...

27
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:30,674
...and there's food in there,
so help yourself.

28
00:02:30,924 --> 00:02:32,634
We shouldn't be later than 1:00.

29
00:02:32,884 --> 00:02:35,554
-I'll hold our cab to take you home.
-Thanks, Dr. Harford.

30
00:02:35,762 --> 00:02:37,764
- You be good, baby.
- Good night, Daddy.

31
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:40,767
- Good night, sweetheart.
- See you in the morning.

32
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:53,321
- Victor, Illona.
- Bill, Alice.

33
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,074
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you for coming.

34
00:02:56,449 --> 00:03:00,912
-Thanks so much for coming.
-We wouldn't miss it for the world.

35
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:04,207
Alice, look at you.
God, you're absolutely stunning!

36
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,334
I don't say that to all the women.
Do I?

37
00:03:06,543 --> 00:03:08,295
-Yes, he does.
-He does?

38
00:03:08,503 --> 00:03:11,506
That osteopath you sent me to,
the guy that worked on my arm?

39
00:03:11,715 --> 00:03:15,093
-You ought to see my serve now.
-He's the top man in New York.

40
00:03:15,302 --> 00:03:17,804
I could have told you that,
looking at his bill.

41
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:20,432
Go inside, have a drink,
enjoy the party.

42
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,351
I'll see you in a little bit.
Thanks for coming.

43
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:38,366
Do you know anyone here?

44
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:42,203
Not a soul.

45
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:54,507
Why do you think Ziegler invites us
to these things every year?

46
00:03:55,717 --> 00:04:00,180
This is what you get
for making house calls.

47
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:13,485
You see that guy at the piano?

48
00:04:14,694 --> 00:04:17,238
I went to medical school with him.

49
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:18,823
Really?

50
00:04:22,077 --> 00:04:24,579
He plays pretty good for a doctor.

51
00:04:25,372 --> 00:04:28,959
He's not a doctor. He dropped out.

52
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:34,506
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you're enjoying yourselves.

53
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:38,176
The band's going to take a break.
We'll be back in 10 minutes.

54
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:39,928
Thank you.

55
00:04:47,102 --> 00:04:48,979
Let's go over and say hello.

56
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:51,606
I desperately need
to go to the bathroom.

57
00:04:51,815 --> 00:04:55,819
You go and say hello, and I'll
meet you where? At the bar?

58
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,404
Good.

59
00:05:07,832 --> 00:05:09,291
Nightingale.

60
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:11,293
Nick Nightingale!

61
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,796
Oh, my God! Bill.

62
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:17,216
Bill Harford!
How the hell are you, buddy?

63
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:20,845
-How long has it been?
-I don't know. Ten years?

64
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:22,388
And a couple.

65
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:24,807
-Do you have time for a drink?
-Sure.

66
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:31,063
You haven't changed a bit.

67
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:34,150
Thanks, I think.
So how you doing?

68
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,069
Not too bad, you know. Not too bad.

69
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:39,572
I see you've become a pianist.

70
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,324
Oh, yes, well, my friends call me that.

71
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,786
How about you?
You still in the doctor business?

72
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:50,041
You know what they say:
"Once a doctor, always a doctor."

73
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:54,544
Yes, or in my case:
"Never a doctor, never a doctor."

74
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:57,798
I never did understand
why you walked away.

75
00:05:58,548 --> 00:06:00,885
It's a nice feeling. I do it a lot.

76
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:02,303
Cheers.

77
00:06:02,887 --> 00:06:06,307
Excuse me.
Nick, I need you a minute.

78
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:08,142
Be right with you.

79
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,020
I gotta go do something.
If I don't catch you later...

80
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:15,024
...I'll be down at the Village
for two weeks at the Sonata CafÃ©.

81
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:17,902
-Stop by if you get a chance.
-I'll be there.

82
00:06:18,736 --> 00:06:21,697
-It's great seeing you.
-Good seeing you too, man.

83
00:07:03,197 --> 00:07:06,616
I think that's my glass.

84
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,954
I'm absolutely certain of it.

85
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:27,972
My name is Sandor Szavost.
I'm Hungarian.

86
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:41,026
My name is Alice Harford.

87
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,404
I'm American.

88
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:45,990
Delighted to meet you, Alice.

89
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:52,329
Did you ever read the Latin poet Ovid
on <i>The Art of Love?</i>

90
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:58,085
Didn't he wind up all by himself...

91
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,046
...crying his eyes out...

92
00:08:01,255 --> 00:08:05,009
...in some place
with a very bad climate?

93
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:09,138
But he also had a good time first.

94
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:11,932
A very good time.

95
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,188
Are you here
with anyone tonight, Alice?

96
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:22,360
With my husband.

97
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:24,654
Oh, how sad.

98
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:30,285
But then I'm sure he's the sort of man
who wouldn't mind if we danced.

99
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:37,334
What do you do, Alice?

100
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:41,254
Well, at the moment...

101
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:44,424
...I'm looking for a job.

102
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:49,346
I used to manage
an art gallery in SoHo.

103
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:52,140
But it went broke.

104
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:55,769
What a shame.

105
00:08:57,479 --> 00:09:00,023
I have some friends in the art game.

106
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,901
Perhaps I can be of some help.

107
00:09:06,655 --> 00:09:08,323
Thank you.

108
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:29,135
Someone you know?

109
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:34,683
My...

110
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:36,768
...husband.

111
00:09:37,018 --> 00:09:38,144
Oh.

112
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:44,484
Don't you think
one of the charms of marriage...

113
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:49,364
...is that it makes deception
a necessity for both parties?

114
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:55,870
May I ask why a beautiful woman...

115
00:09:56,371 --> 00:10:00,041
...who could have any man in this room,
wants to be married?

116
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,005
Why wouldn't she?

117
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:08,883
Is it as bad as that?

118
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,554
As good as that.

119
00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:15,056
Do you know Nuala Windsor?

120
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:19,894
No, and it's very lovely
to meet you both.

121
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:23,940
How do you spell Nuala?

122
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:29,487
N-U-A-L-A.

123
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:33,992
You don't remember me, do you?

124
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,746
You were very kind to me once.

125
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:41,708
Only once?
That sounds like a terrible oversight!

126
00:10:43,084 --> 00:10:47,297
I was doing a photo session
in Rockefeller Plaza...

127
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:49,090
...on a very windy day...?

128
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:53,511
-And you got something in your eye.
-Just about half of Fifth Avenue.

129
00:10:53,928 --> 00:10:57,432
You were such a gentleman!
You gave me your handkerchief...

130
00:10:57,682 --> 00:11:00,143
...which was also clean.

131
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:05,523
That is the kind of hero
I can be sometimes.

132
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:09,611
You know why women used to get married,
don't you?

133
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:13,365
Why don't you tell me?

134
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:18,078
It was the only way they could
lose their virginity...

135
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:22,082
...and be free to do
what they wanted with other men.

136
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:25,335
The ones they really wanted.

137
00:11:30,006 --> 00:11:32,008
Fascinating.

138
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,724
Do you know what's so nice
about doctors?

139
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:44,855
Usually a lot less than people imagine.

140
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:49,193
They always seem so...

141
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:51,654
...knowledgeable.

142
00:11:52,655 --> 00:11:56,492
Oh, they are very knowledgeable...

143
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,578
...about all sorts of things.

144
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:03,666
But I bet they work too hard.

145
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,962
Just think of all they miss.

146
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,215
You're probably right.

147
00:12:12,216 --> 00:12:17,012
Ladies, where exactly are we going?

148
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,223
Exactly?

149
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:24,228
Where the rainbow ends.

150
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:26,689
Where the rainbow ends?

151
00:12:26,897 --> 00:12:30,359
Don't you want to go
where the rainbow ends?

152
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:33,654
Now that depends where that is.

153
00:12:33,863 --> 00:12:35,531
Well, let's find out.

154
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:38,576
Excuse me, ladies.
Sorry, Dr. Harford.

155
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:43,080
Could you come with me for a moment?
Something for Mr. Ziegler.

156
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,584
Fine.

157
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:49,753
To be continued?

158
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,065
Yeah.

159
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:14,653
Bill, thanks for coming.

160
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:19,533
We had a little accident here.

161
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:21,285
What happened?

162
00:13:21,827 --> 00:13:23,746
Well, she was....

163
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:28,417
She was shooting up
and she had a bad reaction.

164
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:31,420
What did she take?

165
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:35,925
A speedball or a snowball
or whatever the hell they call it.

166
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:37,968
It's heroin and coke.

167
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,932
Heroin and coke?

168
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:46,769
Anything else?

169
00:13:48,437 --> 00:13:51,690
We had a couple of drinks,
some champagne. That was it.

170
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:53,859
How long has she been like this?

171
00:13:54,318 --> 00:13:57,446
Maybe five minutes, six minutes,
something like that.

172
00:13:57,738 --> 00:13:58,864
What's her name?

173
00:14:00,157 --> 00:14:01,242
Mandy.

174
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,080
Mandy?

175
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,874
Mandy?

176
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:12,670
Can you hear me, Mandy?

177
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:17,633
Can you hear me?
Move your head if you can hear me.

178
00:14:19,134 --> 00:14:22,221
Move your head if you can
hear me, Mandy. There you go.

179
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,014
You can hear me.

180
00:14:24,223 --> 00:14:28,435
Can you open your eyes for me?
Mandy, can you do that?

181
00:14:29,144 --> 00:14:32,481
Let me see you open your eyes.
There you go, come on.

182
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,693
Come on, look at me. Look at me.

183
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:38,737
Look at me. Look at me.

184
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:42,658
Look at me. Look at me, Mandy.

185
00:14:44,326 --> 00:14:45,369
Good.

186
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:48,205
Good.

187
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:53,460
I love Victor's art collection,
don't you?

188
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,047
Yes.

189
00:14:57,381 --> 00:14:59,258
It's wonderful.

190
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:03,763
Have you ever seen
his sculpture gallery?

191
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,933
No.

192
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:09,769
I haven't.

193
00:15:10,562 --> 00:15:15,358
He has a wonderful collection
of Renaissance bronzes.

194
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:19,696
Do you like the period?

195
00:15:22,907 --> 00:15:24,576
I do.

196
00:15:25,201 --> 00:15:27,370
I adore it.

197
00:15:29,456 --> 00:15:31,916
The sculpture gallery is upstairs.

198
00:15:33,376 --> 00:15:35,378
Would you like to see it?

199
00:15:38,465 --> 00:15:40,258
I can show it to you.

200
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:45,764
We won't be gone long.

201
00:15:53,188 --> 00:15:54,981
Maybe...

202
00:15:57,651 --> 00:16:00,779
...not just...

203
00:16:01,946 --> 00:16:03,365
...now.

204
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:25,679
That was really one hell
of a scare you gave us, kiddo.

205
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:28,598
Sorry.

206
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:39,734
How are you feeling now, Mandy?

207
00:16:41,778 --> 00:16:42,904
Better.

208
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:57,001
You are a very, very lucky girl.

209
00:16:58,128 --> 00:16:59,504
You know that?

210
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:03,341
I know.

211
00:17:04,384 --> 00:17:06,720
You're gonna be okay this time.

212
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:11,224
But you can't keep doing this.

213
00:17:11,975 --> 00:17:13,476
You understand?

214
00:17:15,854 --> 00:17:16,980
Yeah.

215
00:17:17,897 --> 00:17:21,776
You're going to need some rehab.
You know that, don't you?

216
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,155
I know.

217
00:17:27,365 --> 00:17:28,658
Okay.

218
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,619
Okay.

219
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:37,542
Well, Victor...

220
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:41,296
...I'll leave the rest to you.

221
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:44,257
Is it okay if I dress her
and get her out of here?

222
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:48,178
No, I'd keep her here
for another hour.

223
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:49,888
Another hour?

224
00:17:51,556 --> 00:17:54,726
Then I'd have someone take her home.

225
00:17:55,852 --> 00:17:58,438
Okay. Okay.

226
00:18:00,774 --> 00:18:02,275
Good night, Mandy.

227
00:18:02,484 --> 00:18:03,985
Listen....

228
00:18:05,236 --> 00:18:07,447
I can't thank you enough for this.

229
00:18:08,198 --> 00:18:10,408
-You saved my ass.
-I'm glad I was here.

230
00:18:10,617 --> 00:18:13,077
Bill, I probably....

231
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:17,457
I know I don't have to mention this...

232
00:18:17,707 --> 00:18:20,585
...but this is just between us.

233
00:18:21,086 --> 00:18:22,338
Of course.

234
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,131
Thanks.

235
00:18:45,152 --> 00:18:49,740
I think I've had
a little too much champagne.

236
00:18:52,868 --> 00:18:56,455
I think I have to go
and find my husband now.

237
00:18:56,664 --> 00:19:01,293
But I'm sure he'll be all right
on his own a little longer.

238
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:05,214
Yes...

239
00:19:06,632 --> 00:19:08,259
...but will I?

240
00:19:08,926 --> 00:19:10,636
Of course you will.

241
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:14,974
No.

242
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:19,603
I really have to go.
I have to go.

243
00:19:19,812 --> 00:19:21,605
You don't, you know.

244
00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:25,943
Yes, I do.

245
00:19:27,194 --> 00:19:28,362
Alice?

246
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:33,117
I must see you again.

247
00:19:34,952 --> 00:19:37,538
-That's impossible.
-Why?

248
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,791
Because...

249
00:19:43,377 --> 00:19:45,629
...I'm married.

250
00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:51,987
Good morning, Lisa.

251
00:20:52,196 --> 00:20:54,323
Good morning, doctor.
Your mail.

252
00:20:54,531 --> 00:20:57,451
Good. Please ask Janelle
to bring me my coffee.

253
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,286
-Sure.
-Thank you.

254
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,831
-Good morning, Sarah.
-Good morning, doctor.

255
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,085
<i>"'Twas the night before Christmas,</i>
<i>when all through the house...</i>

256
00:21:06,293 --> 00:21:09,171
<i>...not a creature was stirring,</i>
<i>not even a mouse."</i>

257
00:21:13,342 --> 00:21:15,928
Okay. That's fine.
You can put your gown on.

258
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:22,351
Hold this for Mommy.

259
00:21:23,936 --> 00:21:25,729
-Looking forward to Christmas?
-Yeah.

260
00:21:26,814 --> 00:21:28,524
-Does this hurt?
-Yeah.

261
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:44,124
-Right there?
-Yeah.

262
00:21:55,093 --> 00:21:57,012
Daddy's gonna like that.

263
00:21:57,721 --> 00:21:59,431
Very good choice.

264
00:22:00,223 --> 00:22:02,559
"--before me...

265
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:08,023
...when I jump into my bed."

266
00:22:10,025 --> 00:22:14,195
We should call the Zieglers
and thank them for the party.

267
00:22:15,155 --> 00:22:16,990
I've taken care of that.

268
00:22:18,616 --> 00:22:19,993
Good.

269
00:22:20,827 --> 00:22:24,330
So how do you feel about wrapping
the rest of the presents?

270
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:28,209
Let's do that tomorrow.

271
00:23:14,255 --> 00:23:16,382
Tell me something.

272
00:23:21,137 --> 00:23:24,641
Those two girls...

273
00:23:26,476 --> 00:23:29,104
...at the party last night....

274
00:23:34,943 --> 00:23:36,945
Did you...

275
00:23:37,946 --> 00:23:40,323
...by any chance...

276
00:23:40,698 --> 00:23:43,034
...happen to...

277
00:23:44,702 --> 00:23:47,497
...fuck them?

278
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,459
What?

279
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,048
What are you talking about?

280
00:24:01,052 --> 00:24:04,722
I'm talking about the two girls...

281
00:24:05,014 --> 00:24:08,893
...that you were so blatantly
hitting on.

282
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,647
I wasn't hitting on anybody.

283
00:24:16,693 --> 00:24:18,695
Who were they?

284
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,659
They were just a couple of models.

285
00:24:29,706 --> 00:24:34,252
And where did you disappear to
with them for so long?

286
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,421
Wait a minute.

287
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:39,007
Wait a minute.

288
00:24:40,842 --> 00:24:44,804
I didn't disappear with anybody.

289
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,226
Ziegler wasn't feeling too well...

290
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,938
...and I got called upstairs
to see him.

291
00:24:57,734 --> 00:25:00,695
Anyway, who was the guy
you were dancing with?

292
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:09,747
A friend of the Zieglers.

293
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:13,834
What did he want?

294
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:16,128
What did he want?

295
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:20,174
What did he want?

296
00:25:22,885 --> 00:25:24,470
Sex...

297
00:25:26,555 --> 00:25:28,474
...upstairs.

298
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:31,435
Then and there.

299
00:25:33,854 --> 00:25:35,397
Is that all?

300
00:25:35,814 --> 00:25:38,317
Yeah, that was all.

301
00:25:38,525 --> 00:25:41,320
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

302
00:25:45,616 --> 00:25:47,159
That's right.

303
00:25:47,493 --> 00:25:49,787
Well, I guess that's understandable.

304
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,959
Understandable?

305
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:58,003
Because you are a very...

306
00:25:59,046 --> 00:26:01,215
...very beautiful woman.

307
00:26:01,465 --> 00:26:02,633
Whoa.

308
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:04,051
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

309
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:05,678
Wait.

310
00:26:09,682 --> 00:26:11,350
Because I'm a beautiful woman...

311
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:15,854
...the only reason any man
ever wants to talk to me...

312
00:26:17,731 --> 00:26:22,069
...is because he wants to fuck me.
Is that what you're saying?

313
00:26:24,613 --> 00:26:29,535
Well, I don't think it's quite
that black and white...

314
00:26:31,786 --> 00:26:36,542
...but I think we both know
what men are like.

315
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:40,546
So on that basis...

316
00:26:40,713 --> 00:26:45,718
...I should conclude that you
wanted to fuck those two models.

317
00:26:47,636 --> 00:26:50,681
There are exceptions.

318
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:56,228
And what makes you an exception?

319
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:02,651
What makes me an exception is that...

320
00:27:03,861 --> 00:27:06,322
...I happen to be in love with you.

321
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:08,991
And because we're married...

322
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:13,495
...and because I would never
lie to you...

323
00:27:14,163 --> 00:27:15,748
...or hurt you.

324
00:27:23,714 --> 00:27:27,468
Do you realize that
what you're saying...

325
00:27:27,718 --> 00:27:31,096
...is that the only reason you
wouldn't fuck those models...

326
00:27:31,263 --> 00:27:33,848
...is out of consideration for me?

327
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:37,102
Not because you really
wouldn't want to.

328
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,230
Let's just relax, Alice.

329
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:43,025
This pot is making you aggressive.

330
00:27:43,275 --> 00:27:46,653
No! It's not the pot. It's you!

331
00:27:46,904 --> 00:27:49,490
Why can't you ever give me
a straight fucking answer?

332
00:27:49,698 --> 00:27:52,284
I was under the impression
that's what I was doing.

333
00:27:52,493 --> 00:27:55,704
I don't even know
what we're arguing about here.

334
00:27:55,913 --> 00:27:58,123
I'm not arguing.

335
00:27:58,832 --> 00:28:03,379
I'm just trying to find out
where you're coming from.

336
00:28:03,754 --> 00:28:05,339
Where I'm coming from?

337
00:28:09,884 --> 00:28:14,515
Let's say, for example,
you have some gorgeous woman...

338
00:28:14,932 --> 00:28:18,852
...standing in your office naked...

339
00:28:19,061 --> 00:28:21,731
...and you're feeling her fucking tits.

340
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,733
Now, what I want to know....

341
00:28:23,942 --> 00:28:28,947
I want to know what you're thinking
about when you're squeezing them.

342
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,284
Alice, I happen to be a doctor.

343
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:36,079
It's all very impersonal...

344
00:28:36,287 --> 00:28:39,874
...and you know
there's always a nurse present.

345
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,296
So when you're feeling tits, it's
nothing more than your professionalism?

346
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:46,548
Exactly.

347
00:28:46,756 --> 00:28:51,302
Sex is the last thing on my mind
when I'm with a patient.

348
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:56,766
Now, when she is having
her little titties squeezed...

349
00:28:56,975 --> 00:28:59,227
...do you think she ever
has fantasies...

350
00:28:59,436 --> 00:29:03,731
...about what handsome Dr. Bill's
dickie might be like?

351
00:29:05,817 --> 00:29:10,113
Come on, I can assure you
sex is the last thing...

352
00:29:10,363 --> 00:29:14,576
...on this fucking hypothetical
woman patient's mind.

353
00:29:14,826 --> 00:29:16,703
And what makes you so sure?

354
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:23,751
If for no better reason...

355
00:29:24,294 --> 00:29:27,255
...because she's afraid of
what I might find.

356
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:32,927
So after you tell her that
everything's fine, what then?

357
00:29:33,761 --> 00:29:35,388
What then?

358
00:29:36,806 --> 00:29:39,017
I don't know, Alice....

359
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,853
What then?

360
00:29:45,231 --> 00:29:47,734
Women don't....

361
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,405
They basically just don't
think like that.

362
00:29:54,741 --> 00:29:58,244
Millions of years of evolution, right?

363
00:30:00,121 --> 00:30:02,540
Men have to stick it in
every place they can...

364
00:30:02,749 --> 00:30:05,960
...but for women, it is just about
security and commitment...

365
00:30:06,377 --> 00:30:08,421
...and whatever the fuck else!

366
00:30:08,755 --> 00:30:12,383
A little oversimplified, Alice.
But yes, something like that.

367
00:30:12,926 --> 00:30:16,554
If you men only knew.

368
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:22,060
What I do know is you got stoned,
you tried to pick a fight...

369
00:30:22,268 --> 00:30:25,396
...and now you're trying
to make me jealous.

370
00:30:25,605 --> 00:30:27,774
But you're not the jealous type,
are you?

371
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:29,108
No, I'm not.

372
00:30:29,317 --> 00:30:31,402
You've never been jealous about me,
have you?

373
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:32,654
No, I haven't.

374
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,323
And why haven't you ever
been jealous about me?

375
00:30:35,573 --> 00:30:39,494
Well, I don't know, Alice.
Maybe because you're my wife.

376
00:30:39,702 --> 00:30:42,080
Maybe because you're
the mother of my child...

377
00:30:42,288 --> 00:30:45,083
...and I know you would never
be unfaithful to me.

378
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:49,587
You are very, very sure of yourself...

379
00:30:49,796 --> 00:30:51,089
...aren't you?

380
00:30:51,631 --> 00:30:52,799
No.

381
00:30:53,591 --> 00:30:55,301
I'm sure of you.

382
00:31:07,564 --> 00:31:09,399
Do you think that's funny?

383
00:31:18,408 --> 00:31:20,118
All right. Fuck it.

384
00:31:20,868 --> 00:31:24,706
Now we get
the fucking laughing fit, right?

385
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:37,635
Do you...?

386
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:43,475
Do you remember
last summer at Cape Cod?

387
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:48,647
Yes.

388
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,485
Do you remember one night
in the dining room...

389
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:55,863
...there was this young naval officer...

390
00:31:56,071 --> 00:32:00,659
...and he was sitting near our table
with two other officers?

391
00:32:02,161 --> 00:32:03,203
No.

392
00:32:05,956 --> 00:32:10,044
The waiter brought him a message,
at which point he left.

393
00:32:10,252 --> 00:32:12,921
Nothing rings a bell?

394
00:32:13,922 --> 00:32:14,965
No.

395
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:20,888
Well...

396
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:26,894
...I first saw him
that morning in the lobby.

397
00:32:27,686 --> 00:32:30,397
He was checking into the hotel...

398
00:32:30,606 --> 00:32:34,109
...and he was following the bellboy
with his luggage...

399
00:32:34,777 --> 00:32:36,779
...to the elevator.

400
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:45,704
He glanced at me as he walked past.
Just a glance.

401
00:32:46,955 --> 00:32:48,707
Nothing more.

402
00:32:56,048 --> 00:32:59,176
But I could hardly...

403
00:33:00,844 --> 00:33:02,429
...move.

404
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:13,607
That afternoon...

405
00:33:15,943 --> 00:33:19,947
...Helena went to the movies
with her friend...

406
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,828
...and you and I made love.

407
00:33:28,455 --> 00:33:33,460
And we made plans about our future...

408
00:33:34,586 --> 00:33:38,590
...and we talked about Helena.

409
00:33:40,342 --> 00:33:41,969
And yet...

410
00:33:43,095 --> 00:33:45,806
...at no time...

411
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:49,768
...was he ever...

412
00:33:50,978 --> 00:33:54,732
...out of my mind.

413
00:34:00,195 --> 00:34:05,117
And I thought if he wanted me...

414
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,496
...even if it was only...

415
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:12,875
...for one night...

416
00:34:17,171 --> 00:34:20,883
...I was ready to give up everything.

417
00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:24,011
You.

418
00:34:26,638 --> 00:34:28,098
Helena.

419
00:34:30,726 --> 00:34:34,438
My whole fucking future.

420
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,317
Everything.

421
00:34:44,907 --> 00:34:49,244
And yet it was weird,
because at the same time...

422
00:34:50,412 --> 00:34:53,165
...you were dearer to me than ever.

423
00:34:57,669 --> 00:35:00,757
And at that moment, my love for you...

424
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,636
...was both...

425
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:12,143
...tender and sad.

426
00:35:23,071 --> 00:35:25,740
I barely slept that night...

427
00:35:28,284 --> 00:35:31,955
...and I woke up the next morning
in a panic.

428
00:35:34,207 --> 00:35:38,086
I didn't know whether I was
afraid that he had left...

429
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:42,924
...or that he might still be there.

430
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,473
But by dinner...

431
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:56,980
...I realized he was gone...

432
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:05,613
...and I was...

433
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,616
...relieved.

434
00:36:34,017 --> 00:36:35,310
Hello?

435
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:39,439
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

436
00:36:45,945 --> 00:36:47,488
When did it happen?

437
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,453
No. No.

438
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,955
I have the address.

439
00:36:56,789 --> 00:36:58,082
Thank you.

440
00:37:05,798 --> 00:37:08,009
Lou Nathanson just died.

441
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:19,520
I think I have to go over there
and show my face.

442
00:38:13,408 --> 00:38:16,244
-Hello, Rosa.
-Good evening, Dr. Harford.

443
00:38:17,537 --> 00:38:21,375
-How is Miss Nathanson?
-Not so good. She's in the bedroom.

444
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:22,751
Thank you.

445
00:38:38,058 --> 00:38:39,268
Come in.

446
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:46,608
Marion....

447
00:38:48,485 --> 00:38:50,362
Oh, Dr. Harford....

448
00:38:51,155 --> 00:38:53,824
How good of you to come.

449
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:56,493
I came as soon as I got the message.

450
00:38:56,702 --> 00:38:57,953
Thank you.

451
00:38:59,955 --> 00:39:02,166
-I'm so sorry.
-Thank you.

452
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:04,168
Your father was....

453
00:39:05,294 --> 00:39:08,130
He was a very brave man.

454
00:39:08,964 --> 00:39:10,424
Oh, thank you.

455
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:12,843
How are you holding up?

456
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:16,847
I'm a bit numb.

457
00:39:17,306 --> 00:39:20,184
I don't think it's really sunk in yet.

458
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,604
Would you like to sit down?

459
00:39:53,342 --> 00:39:55,594
It's so unreal.

460
00:39:56,887 --> 00:39:58,931
Daddy had such a good day.

461
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:05,521
His mind was clear,
and he remembered so many things.

462
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:10,734
Then he had a little dinner...

463
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,363
...and he said he felt like
taking a nap.

464
00:40:15,697 --> 00:40:20,577
I went into the kitchen and talked
to Rosa for half an hour at most...

465
00:40:21,912 --> 00:40:25,040
...and when I went to see how he was...

466
00:40:25,249 --> 00:40:27,543
...I just thought he was asleep.

467
00:40:32,548 --> 00:40:36,593
Then I realized he wasn't breathing.

468
00:40:40,389 --> 00:40:41,431
Marion...

469
00:40:42,391 --> 00:40:43,976
...from what you've said...

470
00:40:44,184 --> 00:40:48,230
...I'm sure your father died peacefully
in his sleep.

471
00:40:50,023 --> 00:40:52,234
Oh, God, I hope so.

472
00:40:54,403 --> 00:40:59,408
I think I've been more afraid of
the way it was going to happen...

473
00:41:00,033 --> 00:41:02,161
...than his death itself.

474
00:41:03,912 --> 00:41:06,707
Have you had a chance to phone
any of your relatives?

475
00:41:09,001 --> 00:41:13,338
I tried to call my stepmother in London,
but she was out.

476
00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:16,758
My boyfriend, Carl,
is making some calls...

477
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:19,803
...and he'll be coming over soon.

478
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:27,477
I think you've met Carl here
a few times.

479
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:31,857
Yes, I remember him.
He's a teacher, isn't he?

480
00:41:32,065 --> 00:41:34,109
A math professor.

481
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,825
We're going to get married in May.

482
00:41:42,744 --> 00:41:46,748
Well, that's wonderful news.
Congratulations.

483
00:41:50,585 --> 00:41:51,961
Thank you.

484
00:41:54,255 --> 00:41:58,218
Carl has a new teaching appointment
at the University of Michigan.

485
00:41:58,468 --> 00:42:00,595
We'll be moving out there soon.

486
00:42:01,346 --> 00:42:05,350
Michigan's a beautiful state.
I think you'll like it a lot.

487
00:42:08,269 --> 00:42:09,562
Yeah.

488
00:42:12,023 --> 00:42:15,026
It really could be a wonderful
change for you, Marion.

489
00:42:32,543 --> 00:42:33,795
I, um....

490
00:42:34,671 --> 00:42:36,798
Oh, my God, no....

491
00:42:56,734 --> 00:42:58,528
I love you.

492
00:43:01,322 --> 00:43:02,532
I love you.

493
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:05,368
I love you, I love you, I love you.

494
00:43:05,618 --> 00:43:08,538
I don't want to go away with Carl.

495
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,873
Marion, I don't think you realize--

496
00:43:11,082 --> 00:43:12,375
I do.

497
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:17,630
Even if I'm never to see you again,
I want at least to live near you.

498
00:43:18,464 --> 00:43:21,426
Marion, listen to me. Listen to me.

499
00:43:22,677 --> 00:43:27,557
You're very upset, and I don't think
you realize what you're saying.

500
00:43:29,267 --> 00:43:30,727
-I love you.
-Marion.

501
00:43:32,145 --> 00:43:35,064
We barely know each other.

502
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,694
We haven't had a single conversation
about anything except your father.

503
00:43:39,944 --> 00:43:41,612
I love you.

504
00:43:47,785 --> 00:43:49,620
That's probably Carl.

505
00:43:50,747 --> 00:43:53,082
Please don't despise me.

506
00:43:58,755 --> 00:44:00,882
- Hello, Rosa.
- Hello, Mr. Thomas.

507
00:44:02,592 --> 00:44:05,887
-Is she in the bedroom?
-Yes, she is.

508
00:44:06,095 --> 00:44:07,263
Thank you.

509
00:44:18,608 --> 00:44:19,650
Come in.

510
00:44:24,906 --> 00:44:26,199
Darling.

511
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:32,246
I'm so very sorry.

512
00:44:33,122 --> 00:44:34,707
Are you all right?

513
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:36,793
I'm okay.

514
00:44:38,836 --> 00:44:42,215
-Dr. Harford, good evening.
-Good evening, Carl.

515
00:44:42,465 --> 00:44:45,301
Thank you very much
for coming over here tonight.

516
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:48,471
-It's the least I could do.
-It means a lot to us.

517
00:44:48,763 --> 00:44:49,889
Thank you.

518
00:44:52,141 --> 00:44:54,143
Well, I was....

519
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:57,647
I was actually on my way out.

520
00:45:00,442 --> 00:45:01,652
Marion...

521
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,656
...your father was very proud of you...

522
00:45:05,823 --> 00:45:10,828
...and I know you gave him
great comfort these last months.

523
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:13,497
Thank you.

524
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:14,957
Thank you.

525
00:45:20,087 --> 00:45:22,297
I'll show you out.

526
00:45:24,924 --> 00:45:26,176
Good night.

527
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:16,518
Listen to this.
She had a red rose in her mouth.

528
00:46:16,727 --> 00:46:19,229
She was doing a Mexican lap dance
right in my face.

529
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,816
I'm serious!
I got scars on the back of my neck.

530
00:46:22,982 --> 00:46:24,943
What team's this switch hitter playing for?

531
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:27,529
- Looks like the pink team.
- Look at this faggot!

532
00:46:27,738 --> 00:46:29,490
Hey, watch it, you faggot!

533
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,034
Merry Christmas, Mary!

534
00:46:32,242 --> 00:46:34,828
-Your butt-brothers are back there!
-Prime cut of meat!

535
00:46:35,078 --> 00:46:38,540
You want to take a ride in this
fudge-tunnel, you stupid faggot?

536
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:42,544
You should have tits,
you're standing so close!

537
00:46:42,753 --> 00:46:46,840
-I got dumps that are bigger than you!
-Come on, macho man!

538
00:46:47,049 --> 00:46:50,302
-You want a piece of this, baby?
-Exit only, honey.

539
00:46:50,636 --> 00:46:54,097
Go back to San Francisco
where you belong, man!

540
00:47:15,786 --> 00:47:19,498
Excuse me.
Do you know what time it is?

541
00:47:20,457 --> 00:47:22,125
Ten past 12.

542
00:47:24,419 --> 00:47:26,338
Going anywhere special?

543
00:47:26,797 --> 00:47:29,800
No, I'm just taking a walk.

544
00:47:34,596 --> 00:47:36,932
How'd you like to have a little fun?

545
00:47:38,308 --> 00:47:39,851
I'm sorry?

546
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,021
Have a little fun?

547
00:47:44,815 --> 00:47:46,817
I just live right down there.

548
00:47:47,484 --> 00:47:50,153
Would you like to come inside with me?

549
00:47:51,321 --> 00:47:53,490
Come inside with you?

550
00:47:53,907 --> 00:47:55,200
Yeah.

551
00:47:56,118 --> 00:47:59,746
It's a lot nicer in there
than it is out here.

552
00:48:07,129 --> 00:48:08,714
You live in there?

553
00:48:09,339 --> 00:48:10,382
Yes.

554
00:48:11,717 --> 00:48:13,176
By yourself?

555
00:48:13,468 --> 00:48:16,138
No. I have a roommate,
but she's not home.

556
00:48:17,723 --> 00:48:19,099
Hey, it's okay.

557
00:48:19,892 --> 00:48:21,936
Listen, no one will bother us.

558
00:48:22,979 --> 00:48:24,480
It's okay. Come on.

559
00:48:25,231 --> 00:48:26,357
Come on.

560
00:48:52,634 --> 00:48:53,885
This is it.

561
00:48:58,014 --> 00:48:59,515
That's a nice tree.

562
00:49:05,813 --> 00:49:09,567
Sorry about the mess.
Maid's day off.

563
00:49:24,415 --> 00:49:25,708
It's...

564
00:49:26,918 --> 00:49:28,711
...cozy. It's a...

565
00:49:29,754 --> 00:49:31,047
...cozy place.

566
00:49:32,215 --> 00:49:33,591
It's okay.

567
00:49:41,015 --> 00:49:42,225
So....

568
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,820
Do you suppose we
should talk about money?

569
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:56,072
Yeah, I guess so.

570
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,826
That depends on what you want to do.

571
00:50:04,455 --> 00:50:05,873
What do you want to do?

572
00:50:10,253 --> 00:50:11,963
What do you recommend?

573
00:50:16,759 --> 00:50:18,469
What do I recommend?

574
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:35,987
I'd rather not put it into words.

575
00:50:38,781 --> 00:50:40,992
How about you just leave it up to me?

576
00:50:41,492 --> 00:50:43,243
I'm in your hands.

577
00:50:46,122 --> 00:50:48,708
And how does 150 sound?

578
00:50:49,751 --> 00:50:52,211
Sounds wonderful.

579
00:50:56,215 --> 00:51:00,178
Don't worry. I don't
keep track of the time.

580
00:51:07,894 --> 00:51:08,936
<i>Thank you.</i>

581
00:51:09,145 --> 00:51:10,188
<i>Prego, prego.</i>

582
00:51:10,438 --> 00:51:12,648
<i>-Grazie.</i>
<i>-You're welcome.</i>

583
00:51:13,608 --> 00:51:16,110
<i>If I was Italian, he'd have</i>
<i>answered me in Italian.</i>

584
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,694
So....

585
00:52:00,405 --> 00:52:01,740
Shall we?

586
00:52:20,133 --> 00:52:21,468
Excuse me.

587
00:52:31,603 --> 00:52:32,646
Hello?

588
00:52:33,522 --> 00:52:34,731
Hi.

589
00:52:35,774 --> 00:52:37,609
Is everything all right?

590
00:52:41,405 --> 00:52:44,741
I was just wondering if you
were going to be much longer.

591
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:51,248
Listen, it's a little difficult
to talk right now.

592
00:52:52,124 --> 00:52:53,959
It could be a while.

593
00:52:55,419 --> 00:52:57,629
Any idea how long?

594
00:52:58,422 --> 00:53:00,883
No, I don't really know.

595
00:53:01,258 --> 00:53:04,011
We're still waiting
for some relatives to arrive.

596
00:53:06,138 --> 00:53:10,309
Well, I'm gonna go to bed now.

597
00:53:10,893 --> 00:53:12,185
Okay.

598
00:53:12,561 --> 00:53:13,896
Bye-bye.

599
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:32,372
Was that Mrs. Dr. Bill?

600
00:53:41,256 --> 00:53:42,466
Yes.

601
00:53:52,684 --> 00:53:54,186
Do you have to go?

602
00:53:55,436 --> 00:53:57,564
Do I have to go?

603
00:54:02,235 --> 00:54:03,904
I think I do.

604
00:54:06,698 --> 00:54:08,116
Are you sure?

605
00:54:14,289 --> 00:54:16,500
Yes, I'm afraid so.

606
00:54:19,753 --> 00:54:22,714
But listen, I want to pay you anyway.

607
00:54:23,215 --> 00:54:27,552
How much did you say it was?
Hundred and fifty?

608
00:54:28,303 --> 00:54:29,554
Yeah.

609
00:54:31,431 --> 00:54:35,018
But you know what? You don't
have to bother about that.

610
00:54:35,227 --> 00:54:36,728
No, it's all right.

611
00:54:37,604 --> 00:54:40,732
-No, really. You don't have to.
-No, I want to.

612
00:54:43,318 --> 00:54:45,153
-Really?
-Really.

613
00:54:46,863 --> 00:54:48,824
Well, thank you very much.

614
00:55:33,578 --> 00:55:34,787
Thank you.

615
00:55:49,302 --> 00:55:52,554
Would you like a table,
or would you like to sit at the bar?

616
00:55:52,805 --> 00:55:55,600
-I'd like a table.
-Please follow me.

617
00:56:03,733 --> 00:56:05,943
- Can I take your coat?
- Thank you.

618
00:56:07,111 --> 00:56:09,113
Could I get you anything to drink?

619
00:56:10,323 --> 00:56:12,617
- I'd like a beer.
- Certainly.

620
00:56:23,419 --> 00:56:25,630
One, two, one-two-three-four.

621
00:56:26,881 --> 00:56:29,092
That's it for tonight,
ladies and gentlemen.

622
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:34,013
On the bass, Mr. Larry McVey.
On the drums, Kip Fleming.

623
00:56:34,222 --> 00:56:38,351
And on the guitar,
the one, the only, Mr. Bobby Berman.

624
00:56:38,518 --> 00:56:42,730
We'll be here for the next two weeks,
so please do stop by.

625
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:45,525
I'm Nick Nightingale. Good night.

626
00:56:55,952 --> 00:56:58,496
- Nick, that was great.
- Thanks.

627
00:56:58,871 --> 00:57:02,208
- Nightingale.
- Hey, Bill, you made it.

628
00:57:02,416 --> 00:57:05,962
I'm sorry, I got here just as you
were finishing your last set.

629
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:09,215
That's all right.
The band sucked tonight anyway.

630
00:57:09,882 --> 00:57:13,010
- What are you drinking?
- A vodka and tonic, please.

631
00:57:14,595 --> 00:57:15,637
Thank you.

632
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:19,684
So, what brings you out at this hour?

633
00:57:19,892 --> 00:57:23,062
-I have a patient in the neighborhood.
-You live in the Village?

634
00:57:23,271 --> 00:57:26,190
No, we have an apartment
on Central Park West.

635
00:57:26,399 --> 00:57:27,817
You're married?

636
00:57:28,442 --> 00:57:29,819
Nine years.

637
00:57:30,236 --> 00:57:33,197
-Any kids?
-Yes, we have a 7-year-old daughter.

638
00:57:33,406 --> 00:57:34,448
How about you?

639
00:57:34,657 --> 00:57:37,285
I've got a wife
and four boys in Seattle.

640
00:57:37,493 --> 00:57:38,911
You're a long way from home.

641
00:57:39,328 --> 00:57:41,998
Well, you gotta go where the work is.

642
00:57:42,832 --> 00:57:43,875
Thank you.

643
00:57:49,922 --> 00:57:52,341
-Is this your band?
-No, it's a pick-up band.

644
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:56,596
-Who do you normally play with?
-Anybody, anywhere.

645
00:57:56,846 --> 00:57:59,307
I got another gig later tonight.

646
00:57:59,515 --> 00:58:01,434
You're playing somewhere else tonight?

647
00:58:01,642 --> 00:58:03,352
They only get started around 2.

648
00:58:04,145 --> 00:58:05,354
In the Village?

649
00:58:07,565 --> 00:58:10,985
Believe it or not, I don't actually
know the address yet.

650
00:58:11,444 --> 00:58:12,486
You don't?

651
00:58:13,112 --> 00:58:17,868
No. It may sound ridiculous, but it's
in a different place every time...

652
00:58:18,076 --> 00:58:20,871
...and I only get it
an hour or so before.

653
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:23,749
-A different place every time?
-So far.

654
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:26,084
What's the big mystery?

655
00:58:26,877 --> 00:58:30,130
Hey, man, I just play the piano.

656
00:58:33,842 --> 00:58:37,095
Nick, I'm sorry.
Is there something I'm missing here?

657
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:42,976
I play blindfolded.

658
00:58:44,102 --> 00:58:45,896
-What?
-Yeah.

659
00:58:47,105 --> 00:58:49,691
I play blindfolded.

660
00:58:53,737 --> 00:58:55,280
You're putting me on.

661
00:58:55,489 --> 00:58:57,991
No, it's the truth.

662
00:58:58,992 --> 00:59:03,580
And the last time,
the blindfold wasn't on so well.

663
00:59:05,999 --> 00:59:07,668
Oh, man.

664
00:59:08,835 --> 00:59:13,173
Bill, I have seen one or two things
in my life...

665
00:59:13,548 --> 00:59:15,217
...but never...

666
00:59:15,592 --> 00:59:18,011
...never anything like this...

667
00:59:18,762 --> 00:59:21,807
...and never such women.

668
00:59:29,022 --> 00:59:30,065
Well.

669
00:59:32,067 --> 00:59:33,318
Excuse me.

670
00:59:35,696 --> 00:59:36,947
Hello?

671
00:59:37,197 --> 00:59:40,242
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, this is Nick.

672
00:59:46,081 --> 00:59:47,916
I know where that is.

673
00:59:55,465 --> 00:59:56,508
Right.

674
01:00:00,095 --> 01:00:02,055
Well, I'm on my way right now.

675
01:00:02,764 --> 01:00:05,309
Okay, sir. Thank you.

676
01:00:07,728 --> 01:00:09,062
What is this?

677
01:00:10,605 --> 01:00:13,233
It's the name of a Beethoven opera,
isn't it?

678
01:00:13,859 --> 01:00:15,068
Nick....

679
01:00:18,071 --> 01:00:19,698
It's the password.

680
01:00:20,449 --> 01:00:21,950
The password?

681
01:00:23,201 --> 01:00:26,872
Yeah. Look, I'm really sorry
to do this to you, Bill.

682
01:00:27,873 --> 01:00:31,752
I gotta get going. I gotta go.

683
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:34,796
Nick...

684
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:40,761
...you know there is no way on earth...

685
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:44,723
...that you are going to leave here
without taking me with you.

686
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:49,102
-Come on, buddy, give me a break.
-Nick, I'll tell you what.

687
01:00:49,269 --> 01:00:52,522
I've already got the password.

688
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,610
Just give me the address.
I'll go there by myself...

689
01:00:56,818 --> 01:01:00,405
...and there won't be any connection
between us whatsoever.

690
01:01:03,116 --> 01:01:07,287
Listen, let's just say
for one second...

691
01:01:08,246 --> 01:01:10,457
...that I was prepared to do that.

692
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:14,127
You couldn't get in anyway
in those clothes.

693
01:01:15,295 --> 01:01:16,630
Why not?

694
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:21,385
Because everyone is always
costumed and masked.

695
01:01:22,219 --> 01:01:25,889
Where the hell are you gonna
get a costume at this hour?

696
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,995
Thanks. Keep the change.

697
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:03,428
<i>Yes? Who is it?</i>

698
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,388
Peter, this is Bill Harford.

699
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:10,017
I apologize for disturbing you
at this hour, but I need your help.

700
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:13,062
<i>Who is it that you want?</i>

701
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:17,608
I'm very sorry.
I'm looking for Peter Grenning...

702
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:20,319
...the owner of Rainbow Fashions.

703
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,948
<i>What's your name?</i>

704
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:26,492
My name is Bill Harford.

705
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,911
I'm Mr. Grenning's doctor.

706
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,831
<i>You are Grenning's doctor?</i>

707
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:33,249
Yes.

708
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,210
<i>Okay.</i>

709
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,212
<i>Just a moment.</i>

710
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:55,438
You are looking for Peter Grenning?

711
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,231
Yes, I am.

712
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:01,611
He moved to Chicago over a year ago.

713
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,614
He moved to Chicago?

714
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,327
I wasn't aware of that.

715
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:14,874
Then are you the present owner
of Rainbow Fashions?

716
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:16,751
Yes, I am.

717
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,127
Well, first of all...

718
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:23,257
...please let me apologize again
for disturbing you at this hour, Mr....

719
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:24,634
Milich.

720
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:29,013
Mr. Milich. Just to let you know
that I really am Dr. Harford...

721
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:32,266
...this is my New York State
Medical Board card.

722
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:36,103
Okay, so you are Dr. Harford.

723
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:39,774
If I see Peter, I tell him
you were looking for him.

724
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,068
Oh, no, wait. Please, please....

725
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:46,197
Listen, the reason that
I came here tonight was....

726
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:53,162
Basically, the reason is
that I need a costume.

727
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:57,416
And I'd be happy to pay you
$100 over the rental price...

728
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,293
...for the inconvenience.

729
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:02,421
A hundred dollars?

730
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:04,006
Yes.

731
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,593
I don't think so.

732
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:12,932
How about $200?

733
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:16,102
Two hundred dollars
over the rental price?

734
01:04:16,852 --> 01:04:17,979
Yes.

735
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,398
Okay.

736
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:29,198
Come in.

737
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:36,330
Can't be too careful these days.

738
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,668
Please.

739
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:46,340
Is it any special costume
you are looking for?

740
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,633
Yes.

741
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:54,348
I need a tux, a cloak with a hood
and a mask.

742
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:57,853
A cloak with a hood and a mask?

743
01:04:58,145 --> 01:04:59,229
Yes.

744
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,148
Okay.

745
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:04,276
I think we'll find something for you.

746
01:05:05,027 --> 01:05:06,695
Follow me, please.

747
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:08,280
Good.

748
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:19,374
Looks like alive, huh?

749
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:20,959
Yes.

750
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:23,128
-It's wonderful.
-Come.

751
01:05:24,171 --> 01:05:26,465
So, what color cloak?

752
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,635
Black, brown, red?

753
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:32,095
Black.

754
01:05:32,304 --> 01:05:35,891
The good doctor wouldn't
like something more colorful?

755
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:38,685
-I don't think so.
-Clowns, officers, pirates?

756
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,563
No, just the tux, the black cloak--

757
01:05:41,772 --> 01:05:44,024
With a hood and a mask.

758
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,942
-Yes.
-Okay.

759
01:05:46,485 --> 01:05:47,986
May I take your coat?

760
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:53,158
-You are medicine doctor, yes?
-Yes, I am.

761
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:57,954
-I have some problem with my hair.
-Your hair?

762
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,207
It's starting to fall down too fast.

763
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:03,335
I lost, in two weeks, a lot of hair.
Mostly here.

764
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,545
Look at this. Here.

765
01:06:06,922 --> 01:06:08,465
-You see?
-Yes.

766
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:09,925
And?

767
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:13,011
I'm afraid this really isn't my field.

768
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:15,222
What? You can't help me?

769
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:19,017
No. You should see a trichologist.
It's a hair specialist.

770
01:06:19,226 --> 01:06:22,854
Mr. Milich, I've obviously
left things a bit late tonight.

771
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:24,773
-So if you don't mind--
-Okay, okay!

772
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,067
I'm in hurry too, to get back to bed.

773
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:28,568
I understand.

774
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:31,154
So black cloak?

775
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:37,494
Did you hear something?

776
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:42,374
What is this?

777
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:53,885
What is it?

778
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:00,976
What is this?

779
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:17,325
What on earth is going on here?

780
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,661
Milich, I can explain everything.

781
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:22,164
You! What are you doing here?

782
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:24,166
I promise I'll kill you!

783
01:07:24,416 --> 01:07:28,295
And you!
Have you no sense of decency?

784
01:07:28,503 --> 01:07:32,299
Gentlemen, have you
no sense of decency?

785
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:36,136
Milich, are you crazy? We were
invited here by the young lady.

786
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:40,724
Young lady? This is my daughter!
Couldn't you see she's a child?

787
01:07:41,016 --> 01:07:43,727
-You will have to explain to police!
-To the police?

788
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:46,772
You little whore!
I kill you for this.

789
01:07:47,022 --> 01:07:50,567
I promise, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

790
01:07:50,776 --> 01:07:52,944
Hold on to that girl for me, please!

791
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:57,115
Milich, this is preposterous.
The young lady invited us here.

792
01:07:57,324 --> 01:07:59,409
Couldn't you see she is deranged?

793
01:07:59,618 --> 01:08:01,286
Doctor, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

794
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:04,289
Gentlemen, this is now a police matter.

795
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:07,125
You will please stay here
until I return.

796
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:08,960
Let us out of here!

797
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:11,087
That's out of the question.

798
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:14,925
Doctor, sorry.
What color did you say?

799
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:16,761
-Black?
-Black.

800
01:08:17,345 --> 01:08:20,973
Gentlemen, please have the goodness
to be quiet for the moment!

801
01:08:21,182 --> 01:08:23,434
Couldn't you see
I try to serve my customer?

802
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:24,644
Sorry.

803
01:08:25,186 --> 01:08:28,731
And you, little whore, go to bed
at once, you depraved creature.

804
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:31,400
I'll deal with you
after I serve this gentleman.

805
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:34,904
You should have a cloak
lined with ermine.

806
01:10:21,802 --> 01:10:23,930
Okay, that's $74.50.

807
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:28,476
Seventy-four fifty. All right.

808
01:10:29,685 --> 01:10:31,187
There's 80.

809
01:10:31,687 --> 01:10:34,523
I promised you 50 bucks
over the meter, right?

810
01:10:36,817 --> 01:10:40,237
I'll make that a hundred,
if you wait for me.

811
01:10:40,446 --> 01:10:41,989
Just let the meter run.

812
01:10:42,198 --> 01:10:45,576
I'll give you the other half
plus the meter when I get back.

813
01:10:45,785 --> 01:10:48,412
-Okay?
-How long you gonna be?

814
01:10:48,704 --> 01:10:51,999
I don't know, maybe an hour or more.
But maybe only 10 minutes.

815
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,211
I'll leave my stuff here in the back.

816
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:58,506
Okay?

817
01:10:59,465 --> 01:11:00,591
Okay.

818
01:11:13,062 --> 01:11:14,438
Good evening, sir.

819
01:11:15,356 --> 01:11:16,732
Good evening.

820
01:11:17,316 --> 01:11:18,734
Can we be of any help?

821
01:11:20,444 --> 01:11:22,363
I suppose you'd like the password.

822
01:11:22,571 --> 01:11:24,240
If you'd like, sir.

823
01:11:24,407 --> 01:11:25,449
Fidelio.

824
01:11:25,616 --> 01:11:28,744
Thank you, sir.
We'll run you up to the house.

825
01:12:08,785 --> 01:12:10,454
Good evening, sir.

826
01:12:10,662 --> 01:12:12,039
Good evening.

827
01:12:12,414 --> 01:12:13,915
Password, sir?

828
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:15,834
Fidelio.

829
01:12:16,334 --> 01:12:17,794
Thank you, sir.

830
01:18:23,245 --> 01:18:26,039
I'm not sure what you
think you're doing.

831
01:18:26,415 --> 01:18:28,458
But you don't belong here.

832
01:18:29,292 --> 01:18:34,214
I'm sorry, but I think you've
mistaken me for someone else.

833
01:18:37,676 --> 01:18:40,679
Please! Don't be foolish.

834
01:18:41,346 --> 01:18:43,098
You must go now.

835
01:18:47,894 --> 01:18:49,187
Who are you?

836
01:18:49,396 --> 01:18:51,565
It doesn't matter who I am.

837
01:18:52,274 --> 01:18:54,526
You are in great danger.

838
01:18:55,444 --> 01:18:58,238
You must get away
while there's still a chance.

839
01:19:02,534 --> 01:19:05,579
Would you be so good
as to excuse us for a moment?

840
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:07,011
Have you been enjoying yourself?

841
01:22:08,929 --> 01:22:12,558
Well, I've had a very
interesting look around.

842
01:22:15,186 --> 01:22:18,731
Do you want to go somewhere
a little more private?

843
01:22:22,151 --> 01:22:23,194
Private?

844
01:22:25,946 --> 01:22:27,615
That might be a good idea.

845
01:22:27,823 --> 01:22:32,578
Here you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

846
01:22:34,455 --> 01:22:36,540
May I borrow him
for just a few minutes?

847
01:22:36,791 --> 01:22:39,251
I promise to bring him right back.

848
01:22:49,428 --> 01:22:52,348
I don't think you realize
the danger you're in now.

849
01:22:52,556 --> 01:22:54,600
You can't fool them for much longer.

850
01:22:54,809 --> 01:22:57,812
You've got to get away
before it's too late.

851
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:01,816
Why are you telling me this?

852
01:23:02,066 --> 01:23:03,943
It doesn't matter.

853
01:23:04,276 --> 01:23:05,319
Who are you?

854
01:23:07,029 --> 01:23:11,200
You don't want to know.
But you must go. Now!

855
01:23:12,952 --> 01:23:14,578
Will you come with me?

856
01:23:14,787 --> 01:23:16,539
That's impossible.

857
01:23:16,747 --> 01:23:17,790
Why?

858
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:22,253
Because it would cost me
my life and possibly yours.

859
01:23:23,629 --> 01:23:25,297
- Let me see your face.
- No!

860
01:23:27,049 --> 01:23:28,092
Go!

861
01:23:30,302 --> 01:23:31,971
Excuse me, sir.

862
01:23:35,099 --> 01:23:38,519
Are you the gentleman
with the taxi waiting for him?

863
01:23:39,979 --> 01:23:41,147
Yes.

864
01:23:41,397 --> 01:23:45,609
Your driver's at the front door and
would urgently like a word with you.

865
01:24:47,755 --> 01:24:51,300
Please, come forward.

866
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:26,878
May I have the password, please?

867
01:25:29,589 --> 01:25:30,966
Fidelio.

868
01:25:31,633 --> 01:25:36,137
That's right, sir. That is the password...

869
01:25:36,346 --> 01:25:38,181
...for admittance.

870
01:25:39,099 --> 01:25:43,854
But may I ask, what is the password
for the house?

871
01:25:49,442 --> 01:25:52,404
The password for the house?

872
01:25:52,988 --> 01:25:54,239
Yes.

873
01:26:03,748 --> 01:26:05,333
I'm sorry, I....

874
01:26:11,965 --> 01:26:13,550
I seem to have...

875
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:16,803
...forgotten it.

876
01:26:18,638 --> 01:26:20,974
That's unfortunate.

877
01:26:21,766 --> 01:26:26,730
Because here, it doesn't matter
whether you have forgotten it...

878
01:26:27,147 --> 01:26:29,816
...or if you never knew it.

879
01:26:31,151 --> 01:26:35,155
You will kindly remove your mask.

880
01:26:55,717 --> 01:26:56,968
Now...

881
01:26:57,677 --> 01:26:59,262
...get undressed.

882
01:27:05,685 --> 01:27:08,939
Get undressed?

883
01:27:10,106 --> 01:27:13,318
Remove your clothes.

884
01:27:24,913 --> 01:27:28,208
Gentlemen, please....

885
01:27:31,044 --> 01:27:33,797
Remove your clothes.

886
01:27:34,005 --> 01:27:37,842
Or would you like us to do it for you?

887
01:27:39,386 --> 01:27:40,512
Stop!

888
01:27:46,393 --> 01:27:49,229
Let him go.

889
01:27:51,231 --> 01:27:52,857
Take me!

890
01:27:54,609 --> 01:27:57,988
I am ready to redeem him.

891
01:28:04,119 --> 01:28:07,872
You are ready to redeem him?

892
01:28:09,874 --> 01:28:11,376
Yes.

893
01:28:14,295 --> 01:28:18,384
Are you sure you understand
what you're taking upon yourself...

894
01:28:18,759 --> 01:28:20,761
...in doing this?

895
01:28:22,138 --> 01:28:23,347
Yes!

896
01:28:30,187 --> 01:28:31,564
Very well.

897
01:28:36,777 --> 01:28:38,487
You are free.

898
01:28:40,364 --> 01:28:42,116
But I warn you...

899
01:28:42,783 --> 01:28:45,286
...if you make any further inquiries...

900
01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:49,457
...or if you say a single word
to anyone...

901
01:28:49,665 --> 01:28:52,376
...about what you have seen...

902
01:28:52,585 --> 01:28:57,089
...there will be the most
dire consequences for you...

903
01:28:57,339 --> 01:28:59,341
...and your family.

904
01:29:01,052 --> 01:29:03,179
Do you understand?

905
01:29:42,968 --> 01:29:45,513
What is going to happen to that woman?

906
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:49,391
No one can change her fate now.

907
01:29:50,351 --> 01:29:52,937
When a promise has been made here...

908
01:29:53,854 --> 01:29:56,357
...there is no turning back.

909
01:29:57,607 --> 01:29:58,901
Go!

910
01:32:02,484 --> 01:32:03,693
Alice?

911
01:32:05,695 --> 01:32:06,780
Alice?

912
01:32:07,197 --> 01:32:08,365
It's okay.

913
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:10,408
It's okay.

914
01:32:11,618 --> 01:32:13,078
I'm sorry.

915
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:18,166
I'm sorry I woke you up, but I thought
you were having a nightmare.

916
01:32:18,749 --> 01:32:20,210
Oh, God.

917
01:32:21,294 --> 01:32:24,214
I just had such a horrible dream.

918
01:32:26,007 --> 01:32:27,592
What time is it?

919
01:32:28,051 --> 01:32:29,928
It's a little after 4.

920
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:34,641
Did you just get home?

921
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:36,351
Yes.

922
01:32:37,352 --> 01:32:41,106
It took longer than I thought.

923
01:32:41,523 --> 01:32:43,692
You must be exhausted.

924
01:32:44,317 --> 01:32:47,696
Come on, lie down.

925
01:32:56,413 --> 01:32:58,206
What were you dreaming?

926
01:33:04,379 --> 01:33:07,299
Just these weird things.

927
01:33:07,590 --> 01:33:09,050
What was it?

928
01:33:12,721 --> 01:33:15,390
It was so weird.

929
01:33:18,059 --> 01:33:19,269
Tell me.

930
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:38,204
We were....

931
01:33:40,415 --> 01:33:43,585
We were in a deserted city...

932
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:51,092
...and our clothes were gone.

933
01:33:52,969 --> 01:33:54,888
We were naked...

934
01:34:00,393 --> 01:34:03,104
...and I was terrified...

935
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:10,528
...and I felt ashamed.

936
01:34:11,613 --> 01:34:13,281
Oh, God....

937
01:34:17,619 --> 01:34:21,664
And I was angry because
I thought it was your fault.

938
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:28,630
You rushed away to go
find clothes for us.

939
01:34:33,009 --> 01:34:36,971
As soon as you were gone,
it was completely different.

940
01:34:41,226 --> 01:34:43,228
I felt wonderful.

941
01:34:47,732 --> 01:34:52,404
Then I was lying
in a beautiful garden...

942
01:34:52,946 --> 01:34:56,158
...stretched out naked
in the sunlight...

943
01:35:01,038 --> 01:35:03,958
...and a man walked out of the woods.

944
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:12,466
He was the man from the hotel,
the one I told you about.

945
01:35:15,177 --> 01:35:17,012
The naval officer.

946
01:35:21,892 --> 01:35:24,103
He stared at me...

947
01:35:29,066 --> 01:35:31,235
...and then he just laughed.

948
01:35:34,196 --> 01:35:36,323
He just laughed at me.

949
01:35:52,590 --> 01:35:54,425
But that's not the end...

950
01:35:55,509 --> 01:35:56,719
...is it?

951
01:35:58,554 --> 01:35:59,847
No.

952
01:36:02,516 --> 01:36:04,852
Why don't you tell me the rest of it?

953
01:36:10,733 --> 01:36:12,735
It's too awful.

954
01:36:14,528 --> 01:36:16,405
It's only a dream.

955
01:36:41,889 --> 01:36:43,974
He was kissing me...

956
01:36:50,397 --> 01:36:53,275
...and then we were making love.

957
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:01,784
Then there were all these
other people around us...

958
01:37:01,951 --> 01:37:04,787
...hundreds of them, everywhere.

959
01:37:04,995 --> 01:37:07,540
Everyone was fucking.

960
01:37:13,379 --> 01:37:14,922
And then I....

961
01:37:18,008 --> 01:37:20,511
I was fucking other men.

962
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:22,930
So many...

963
01:37:24,515 --> 01:37:27,351
...I don't know how many I was with.

964
01:37:30,479 --> 01:37:35,359
And I knew you could see me
in the arms of all these men...

965
01:37:38,237 --> 01:37:41,115
...just fucking all these men.

966
01:37:45,578 --> 01:37:48,330
I wanted to make fun of you...

967
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:52,459
...to laugh in your face.

968
01:37:55,754 --> 01:38:00,718
And so I laughed as loud as I could.

969
01:38:14,858 --> 01:38:17,986
That must have been
when you woke me up.

970
01:39:02,238 --> 01:39:03,698
Shit!

971
01:39:37,816 --> 01:39:39,984
-Hi.
-Hi.

972
01:39:40,777 --> 01:39:42,862
I'll just have a cup of coffee, please.

973
01:39:50,328 --> 01:39:51,579
Anything else?

974
01:39:52,872 --> 01:39:54,624
No, thank you.

975
01:40:01,464 --> 01:40:02,841
Excuse me.

976
01:40:03,842 --> 01:40:07,011
Do you know when they get in
next door at the Sonata CafÃ©?

977
01:40:07,219 --> 01:40:10,640
I think there's usually someone
in the office around 2 or 3.

978
01:40:15,186 --> 01:40:19,691
I don't suppose, by any chance,
you know Nick Nightingale?

979
01:40:19,899 --> 01:40:22,861
He's playing piano
over there right now.

980
01:40:23,153 --> 01:40:24,654
Nick Nightingale?

981
01:40:25,071 --> 01:40:27,657
Sure, he comes in here.

982
01:40:30,493 --> 01:40:33,245
Look, maybe you can help me...

983
01:40:33,496 --> 01:40:37,083
...because it's important that
I get in touch with him.

984
01:40:38,293 --> 01:40:40,044
Do you know where he's staying?

985
01:40:40,712 --> 01:40:41,880
Well....

986
01:40:43,715 --> 01:40:46,801
I don't know if he'd want me
to give out his address.

987
01:40:47,010 --> 01:40:49,387
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

988
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:52,140
I'm actually an old friend of his.

989
01:40:53,725 --> 01:40:55,226
Well, doctor...

990
01:40:57,729 --> 01:41:01,357
...he'll be playing there tonight.
Can't it wait until then?

991
01:41:03,109 --> 01:41:04,194
Listen.

992
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:06,278
To be perfectly honest...

993
01:41:08,573 --> 01:41:10,325
...it's a medical matter.

994
01:41:10,742 --> 01:41:15,038
Some tests. I know he'll want to
know about them as soon as possible.

995
01:41:42,233 --> 01:41:43,275
Excuse me.

996
01:41:44,944 --> 01:41:47,154
Hi! How can I help you?

997
01:41:47,363 --> 01:41:51,116
Can you please ring
Mr. Nightingale's room for me?

998
01:41:51,659 --> 01:41:55,287
I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Nightingale
has already checked out.

999
01:41:55,579 --> 01:41:57,873
-He checked out?
-Yes.

1000
01:42:01,126 --> 01:42:05,089
-Did he leave a forwarding address?
-No, I'm afraid not.

1001
01:42:06,382 --> 01:42:08,217
When did he check out?

1002
01:42:09,718 --> 01:42:11,679
About 5:00 this morning.

1003
01:42:11,929 --> 01:42:13,264
5:00?

1004
01:42:14,974 --> 01:42:16,892
That's an early checkout, isn't it?

1005
01:42:17,101 --> 01:42:19,895
It is a little on the early side, yeah.

1006
01:42:21,105 --> 01:42:22,189
Look...

1007
01:42:23,983 --> 01:42:26,902
...did you notice anything...

1008
01:42:27,236 --> 01:42:28,696
...I don't know...

1009
01:42:29,362 --> 01:42:32,408
...unusual about him when he left?

1010
01:42:34,410 --> 01:42:35,828
Unusual?

1011
01:42:37,413 --> 01:42:39,415
Hey, you're not Five-O, are you?

1012
01:42:40,958 --> 01:42:42,334
No, I'm an old friend of his.

1013
01:42:42,543 --> 01:42:43,669
Really?

1014
01:42:44,128 --> 01:42:45,629
I'm a doctor.

1015
01:42:48,924 --> 01:42:53,262
-Well, Bill...?
-Sure.

1016
01:42:55,639 --> 01:42:58,559
It's funny you should
ask that question, Bill...

1017
01:42:58,809 --> 01:43:02,146
...because there was something
a little strange...

1018
01:43:02,354 --> 01:43:04,857
...about the way Mr. Nightingale left.

1019
01:43:05,190 --> 01:43:07,568
Really? What was that?

1020
01:43:08,819 --> 01:43:09,945
Well....

1021
01:43:15,743 --> 01:43:20,289
He came in this morning,
about 4:30 a.m...

1022
01:43:20,873 --> 01:43:22,791
...with two men.

1023
01:43:23,792 --> 01:43:25,502
Big guys.

1024
01:43:26,045 --> 01:43:29,006
They were very well-dressed
and very well-spoken.

1025
01:43:29,214 --> 01:43:32,885
But they weren't the kind of people
you'd fool around with...

1026
01:43:33,177 --> 01:43:34,887
...if you know what I mean.

1027
01:43:37,681 --> 01:43:39,183
Anyways...

1028
01:43:40,476 --> 01:43:45,230
...I noticed Mr. Nightingale
had a bruise on his cheek.

1029
01:43:45,981 --> 01:43:50,903
To be perfectly honest, I also
thought he looked a little scared.

1030
01:43:51,904 --> 01:43:53,072
Scared?

1031
01:43:53,364 --> 01:43:54,949
Yes. Yes.

1032
01:43:55,824 --> 01:43:57,450
He said he wanted to check out.

1033
01:43:57,701 --> 01:44:01,580
And then he went upstairs to his room
with one of the men.

1034
01:44:01,872 --> 01:44:05,751
The other guy stayed down in the lobby
and settled his bill.

1035
01:44:06,502 --> 01:44:10,714
When they came back, Mr. Nightingale
tried to pass me an envelope.

1036
01:44:10,881 --> 01:44:12,591
But they saw it and took it...

1037
01:44:12,841 --> 01:44:15,719
...and said that any mail
or messages for him...

1038
01:44:15,970 --> 01:44:20,516
...would be collected by someone
properly authorized to do so.

1039
01:44:21,350 --> 01:44:23,852
And then they just
took him off in a car.

1040
01:44:25,145 --> 01:44:27,480
Do you have any idea where they went?

1041
01:44:27,898 --> 01:44:29,775
No, not a clue.

1042
01:44:34,863 --> 01:44:35,990
Well....

1043
01:44:38,242 --> 01:44:39,492
Anyway....

1044
01:44:41,912 --> 01:44:44,081
I certainly appreciate your help.

1045
01:44:44,289 --> 01:44:45,916
Anytime, Bill.

1046
01:44:46,125 --> 01:44:47,167
Bye.

1047
01:45:21,995 --> 01:45:24,581
Oh, the good doctor!

1048
01:45:24,789 --> 01:45:26,124
Mr. Milich.

1049
01:45:26,458 --> 01:45:31,421
-Was your outfit a success?
-Yes, it was. Thank you.

1050
01:45:31,963 --> 01:45:33,298
Good, good.

1051
01:45:33,465 --> 01:45:38,470
Tuxedo. Cloak. Shoes.

1052
01:45:41,056 --> 01:45:44,809
I think you forgot the mask.

1053
01:45:46,102 --> 01:45:47,604
It's not there?

1054
01:45:48,562 --> 01:45:51,107
Maybe you left it at the party?

1055
01:45:56,154 --> 01:45:57,739
I don't think so.

1056
01:45:59,699 --> 01:46:03,244
I must have lost it.
Could you put it on the bill, please?

1057
01:46:03,453 --> 01:46:04,496
Sure.

1058
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:10,627
Here we are.

1059
01:46:12,170 --> 01:46:16,257
That was 150 for the rental,
200 you said for my trouble...

1060
01:46:16,466 --> 01:46:19,928
...25 for the mask. Sorry....

1061
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:24,349
Three hundred seventy-five.

1062
01:46:26,976 --> 01:46:28,269
Yes, dear?

1063
01:46:28,602 --> 01:46:30,063
Come, come.

1064
01:46:31,356 --> 01:46:34,275
Would you like to say hello
to Dr. Harford?

1065
01:46:35,527 --> 01:46:38,029
-Hello.
-Hello.

1066
01:46:43,576 --> 01:46:46,412
Thank you, Mr. Milich.
I'll call you soon.

1067
01:46:47,372 --> 01:46:49,249
Goodbye, gentlemen.

1068
01:46:49,541 --> 01:46:52,794
- Merry Christmas and happy New Year!
- And you too.

1069
01:46:53,753 --> 01:46:56,005
Well, Dr. Harford...

1070
01:46:57,257 --> 01:46:58,883
...here is your receipt.

1071
01:47:00,176 --> 01:47:02,428
I'm tearing up your deposits...

1072
01:47:03,596 --> 01:47:05,932
...and thanks for the business.

1073
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:13,815
Mr. Milich, last night...

1074
01:47:16,609 --> 01:47:19,028
...you were going to call the police.

1075
01:47:19,195 --> 01:47:24,658
Well, things change.
We have come to another arrangement.

1076
01:47:24,909 --> 01:47:29,831
And by the way, if the good doctor
should ever want anything again...

1077
01:47:30,456 --> 01:47:32,208
...anything at all...

1078
01:47:33,209 --> 01:47:35,753
...it needn't be a costume.

1079
01:48:03,239 --> 01:48:04,490
Come in.

1080
01:48:06,201 --> 01:48:08,953
- Tuna salad and black coffee.
- Thanks.

1081
01:48:09,996 --> 01:48:13,041
Listen, how's my afternoon looking?

1082
01:48:13,249 --> 01:48:18,214
I think it's just Mrs. Akerly at 2:30
and Mrs. Kominski at 4.

1083
01:48:18,589 --> 01:48:22,801
Well, something's come up, and I'm
not going to be able to see them.

1084
01:48:23,052 --> 01:48:26,721
Please ask Dr. Miller if he can fit
them in. Otherwise, just apologize...

1085
01:48:26,972 --> 01:48:28,849
-...and make new appointments.
-Sure.

1086
01:48:29,308 --> 01:48:33,395
And please call the garage and have
them get my car out in half an hour.

1087
01:48:33,604 --> 01:48:34,980
No problem.

1088
01:52:16,952 --> 01:52:18,037
Hi.

1089
01:52:18,288 --> 01:52:19,955
Hi, Daddy.

1090
01:52:20,956 --> 01:52:22,250
Hi.

1091
01:52:24,711 --> 01:52:27,380
Any calls for me?

1092
01:52:27,589 --> 01:52:31,551
Dr. Sanders and Mrs. Shapiro.

1093
01:52:32,844 --> 01:52:35,305
- Hey, gang.
- Hi, Daddy.

1094
01:52:36,222 --> 01:52:38,141
Look, I got all these right.

1095
01:52:38,349 --> 01:52:40,351
You got all of those right?

1096
01:52:40,894 --> 01:52:42,645
Every single one of them?

1097
01:52:43,021 --> 01:52:44,314
That's good.

1098
01:52:44,522 --> 01:52:46,107
You hungry?

1099
01:52:47,233 --> 01:52:48,526
Sort of.

1100
01:52:48,735 --> 01:52:50,528
Want to eat at 7?

1101
01:52:50,737 --> 01:52:53,072
Seven? Listen, can we
make that earlier?

1102
01:52:53,281 --> 01:52:57,243
I have some appointments
at the office.

1103
01:52:57,452 --> 01:52:59,496
You have to go out again tonight?

1104
01:52:59,704 --> 01:53:00,747
I'm afraid so.

1105
01:53:00,914 --> 01:53:04,417
Daddy, am I gonna get
a puppy for Christmas?

1106
01:53:05,043 --> 01:53:07,504
We'll see about that, okay?

1107
01:53:10,089 --> 01:53:12,175
He could be a watchdog.

1108
01:53:12,383 --> 01:53:13,885
We'll see.

1109
01:53:14,093 --> 01:53:16,846
Come on, baby, let's finish this off.

1110
01:53:17,055 --> 01:53:20,683
All right, we have Joe.
And Joe has $2.50.

1111
01:53:20,892 --> 01:53:25,522
And Mike has $1.75.

1112
01:53:25,772 --> 01:53:29,400
Joe has how much more money than Mike?

1113
01:53:29,609 --> 01:53:31,945
$0.75?

1114
01:53:33,863 --> 01:53:37,283
So is it gonna be
a subtraction or an addition?

1115
01:53:40,995 --> 01:53:44,290
"How much more" means that
it would be a subtraction.

1116
01:53:44,457 --> 01:53:47,502
Yeah, because you're going
to be taking. Right.

1117
01:53:47,794 --> 01:53:51,089
<i>And there were all these</i>
<i>other people around us.</i>

1118
01:53:51,464 --> 01:53:53,925
<i>Hundreds of them, everywhere.</i>

1119
01:53:54,425 --> 01:53:56,678
<i>Everyone was fucking.</i>

1120
01:53:57,595 --> 01:54:01,099
<i>And then I....</i>
<i>I was fucking other men.</i>

1121
01:54:02,475 --> 01:54:04,143
<i>So many...</i>

1122
01:54:04,602 --> 01:54:07,564
<i>...I don't know how many I was with.</i>

1123
01:55:13,005 --> 01:55:14,048
Hello?

1124
01:55:15,924 --> 01:55:17,176
<i>Hello?</i>

1125
01:55:19,762 --> 01:55:21,055
Hello?

1126
01:55:45,079 --> 01:55:47,790
Keep the change. Merry Christmas.

1127
01:56:18,278 --> 01:56:19,321
What is it?

1128
01:56:19,571 --> 01:56:20,781
Domino?

1129
01:56:21,115 --> 01:56:22,991
No, she's not in.

1130
01:56:26,954 --> 01:56:29,164
Are you expecting her back soon?

1131
01:56:29,373 --> 01:56:30,874
No, I'm not.

1132
01:56:34,837 --> 01:56:36,255
Okay.

1133
01:56:37,506 --> 01:56:40,968
I have something for her.
Can I leave this with you?

1134
01:56:41,802 --> 01:56:43,095
Just a minute.

1135
01:56:50,144 --> 01:56:51,979
Can I say who it's from?

1136
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:55,816
Well, just tell her it's from...

1137
01:56:56,859 --> 01:56:57,901
...Bill.

1138
01:56:58,485 --> 01:56:59,695
You're Bill?

1139
01:56:59,987 --> 01:57:01,029
Yes.

1140
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:05,284
The Bill? You're the doctor
who was here last night?

1141
01:57:06,326 --> 01:57:08,787
Well, I suppose I am.

1142
01:57:09,121 --> 01:57:11,415
Domino said how nice you were to her.

1143
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:13,834
Did she?

1144
01:57:16,670 --> 01:57:18,672
Why don't you come in for a second?

1145
01:57:21,717 --> 01:57:22,760
Sure.

1146
01:57:43,530 --> 01:57:45,032
I'm Sally.

1147
01:57:45,783 --> 01:57:47,659
-Hello, Sally.
-Hi.

1148
01:57:50,704 --> 01:57:55,709
So do you have any idea
when you expect Domino back?

1149
01:57:57,085 --> 01:57:58,253
No.

1150
01:57:59,254 --> 01:58:01,215
I have no idea.

1151
01:58:02,132 --> 01:58:04,134
-You have no idea?
-No.

1152
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:14,604
To be perfectly honest,
she may not even be coming back.

1153
01:58:16,856 --> 01:58:19,692
She may not even be coming back?

1154
01:58:40,421 --> 01:58:41,589
I....

1155
01:58:45,009 --> 01:58:46,135
You...?

1156
01:58:46,386 --> 01:58:50,765
I think there's something
that I should tell you.

1157
01:58:51,224 --> 01:58:53,142
-Really?
-Yeah.

1158
01:58:54,143 --> 01:58:56,938
But I just don't know.
I don't know.

1159
01:58:57,146 --> 01:59:00,441
You don't know?
Well, what is it?

1160
01:59:04,487 --> 01:59:06,781
I don't know whether to tell you this.

1161
01:59:09,158 --> 01:59:10,451
Wow....

1162
01:59:12,412 --> 01:59:15,290
Why don't you have a seat?

1163
01:59:15,999 --> 01:59:17,792
Let's sit down.

1164
01:59:33,933 --> 01:59:38,271
-I don't quite know how to say this.
-You don't quite know how?

1165
01:59:42,650 --> 01:59:46,446
Well, considering that you
were with Domino last night...

1166
01:59:48,990 --> 01:59:53,411
...I think it would be only fair to you
to let you know...

1167
01:59:56,539 --> 01:59:59,834
...that she got the results
of a blood test this morning...

1168
02:00:00,043 --> 02:00:03,296
...and it was HIV-positive.

1169
02:00:14,349 --> 02:00:16,184
-HIV-positive?
-Yeah.

1170
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:28,488
Well....

1171
02:00:31,616 --> 02:00:36,496
I am very, very sorry to hear that.

1172
02:00:41,125 --> 02:00:42,210
Yeah.

1173
02:00:43,711 --> 02:00:46,714
I mean, it's absolutely devastating.

1174
02:00:59,727 --> 02:01:02,438
Listen, can I offer you anything?

1175
02:01:02,939 --> 02:01:04,857
A cup of coffee maybe?

1176
02:01:13,533 --> 02:01:14,951
No, thank you.

1177
02:01:19,747 --> 02:01:21,290
I think...

1178
02:01:22,625 --> 02:01:24,544
...maybe I'd better be going.

1179
02:01:29,298 --> 02:01:30,341
Okay.

1180
02:03:13,487 --> 02:03:15,072
- Taxi!
- Off duty.

1181
02:05:04,891 --> 02:05:07,977
I'll just have a cappuccino, please.

1182
02:05:08,144 --> 02:05:09,979
I'll bring it over to you.

1183
02:05:10,146 --> 02:05:11,314
Thank you.

1184
02:06:51,372 --> 02:06:52,665
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

1185
02:06:52,874 --> 02:06:54,334
I'm Dr. Harford.

1186
02:06:54,584 --> 02:06:58,921
One of my patients was admitted
this morning. Miss Amanda Curran.

1187
02:06:59,130 --> 02:07:01,215
Could you please
give me her room number?

1188
02:07:01,424 --> 02:07:05,219
Certainly, doctor.
Her name again?

1189
02:07:05,595 --> 02:07:08,181
Curran. Amanda Curran.

1190
02:07:08,389 --> 02:07:10,600
C-U-R-R-A-N?

1191
02:07:12,101 --> 02:07:13,144
Yes.

1192
02:07:15,146 --> 02:07:16,981
Miss Amanda Curran?

1193
02:07:17,774 --> 02:07:19,108
That's right.

1194
02:07:19,817 --> 02:07:23,279
I'm sorry, doctor.
Miss Curran died this afternoon.

1195
02:07:27,325 --> 02:07:29,202
She died this afternoon?

1196
02:07:29,619 --> 02:07:32,914
Yes, at 3:45 p.m.

1197
02:07:33,373 --> 02:07:34,832
I'm sorry.

1198
02:08:23,006 --> 02:08:25,676
<i>Because it could cost me my life...</i>

1199
02:08:26,593 --> 02:08:28,679
<i>...and possibly yours.</i>

1200
02:10:12,366 --> 02:10:13,617
Hello?

1201
02:10:14,493 --> 02:10:16,286
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

1202
02:10:18,455 --> 02:10:19,790
Tonight?

1203
02:10:20,457 --> 02:10:22,584
No, no, that's okay.

1204
02:10:26,672 --> 02:10:29,675
Please tell him I'll be there
in about 20 minutes.

1205
02:10:53,323 --> 02:10:54,616
Come in.

1206
02:10:56,660 --> 02:11:00,372
Bill, I appreciate you coming.
Sorry to drag you out here.

1207
02:11:00,664 --> 02:11:03,375
-Let me have your coat.
-I was out anyway. Thank you.

1208
02:11:03,584 --> 02:11:05,002
How about a drink?

1209
02:11:05,544 --> 02:11:07,421
-Are you having one?
-Sure.

1210
02:11:07,879 --> 02:11:09,339
What would you like?

1211
02:11:09,756 --> 02:11:11,049
Just a little scotch.

1212
02:11:11,258 --> 02:11:12,342
Good.

1213
02:11:14,344 --> 02:11:15,470
How do you take it? Neat?

1214
02:11:15,679 --> 02:11:16,847
Please.

1215
02:11:18,557 --> 02:11:20,726
That was a terrific party
the other night.

1216
02:11:20,934 --> 02:11:24,730
-Alice and I had a wonderful time.
-Well, good.

1217
02:11:25,689 --> 02:11:27,482
It was great seeing you both.

1218
02:11:27,691 --> 02:11:29,151
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1219
02:11:29,860 --> 02:11:31,278
Were you playing?

1220
02:11:31,738 --> 02:11:35,033
No, I was just
knocking a few balls around.

1221
02:11:36,284 --> 02:11:38,995
-Beautiful scotch.
-That's a 25-year-old.

1222
02:11:39,245 --> 02:11:41,706
-I'll send you over a case.
-No, please.

1223
02:11:41,914 --> 02:11:43,708
-Why not?
-No, no. No.

1224
02:11:46,377 --> 02:11:48,546
You feel like playing?

1225
02:11:48,755 --> 02:11:52,091
No, thanks.
You go ahead, I'll watch.

1226
02:11:54,636 --> 02:11:56,095
I was just....

1227
02:11:58,890 --> 02:12:00,016
Listen....

1228
02:12:01,684 --> 02:12:03,019
Bill....

1229
02:12:06,606 --> 02:12:11,569
The reason I asked you
to come over is...

1230
02:12:13,488 --> 02:12:15,907
...I need to talk to you
about something.

1231
02:12:16,783 --> 02:12:18,034
Sure.

1232
02:12:21,245 --> 02:12:22,914
It's a little bit awkward.

1233
02:12:25,541 --> 02:12:28,419
And I have to be completely frank.

1234
02:12:30,630 --> 02:12:32,674
What kind of problem are you having?

1235
02:12:37,303 --> 02:12:39,430
It isn't a medical problem.

1236
02:12:45,103 --> 02:12:46,479
Actually...

1237
02:12:48,439 --> 02:12:50,316
...it concerns you.

1238
02:12:58,950 --> 02:13:00,201
Bill...

1239
02:13:03,371 --> 02:13:06,457
...I know what happened last night.

1240
02:13:10,461 --> 02:13:14,048
And I know what's been
going on since then.

1241
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:22,056
And I think you just might...

1242
02:13:23,474 --> 02:13:26,894
...have the wrong idea
about one or two things.

1243
02:13:40,199 --> 02:13:42,660
I'm sorry, Victor, I....

1244
02:13:44,662 --> 02:13:47,874
What in the hell
are you talking about?

1245
02:13:50,001 --> 02:13:52,670
Please, Bill, no games.

1246
02:13:54,839 --> 02:13:56,299
I was there.

1247
02:13:58,259 --> 02:13:59,802
At the house.

1248
02:14:03,389 --> 02:14:06,517
I saw everything that went on.

1249
02:14:15,276 --> 02:14:16,360
Bill...

1250
02:14:18,362 --> 02:14:22,325
...what the hell did you think
you were doing?

1251
02:14:26,037 --> 02:14:29,332
I couldn't even begin to imagine...

1252
02:14:30,541 --> 02:14:32,168
...how you'd heard about it...

1253
02:14:32,376 --> 02:14:36,047
...let alone got yourself
through the door.

1254
02:14:39,842 --> 02:14:44,806
Then I remembered seeing you
with that prick piano player...

1255
02:14:45,056 --> 02:14:48,267
...Nick whatever the fuck his name was,
at my party.

1256
02:14:49,227 --> 02:14:52,231
And it didn't take much to
figure out the rest.

1257
02:14:56,693 --> 02:14:58,570
It wasn't Nick's fault.

1258
02:15:00,322 --> 02:15:01,865
It was mine.

1259
02:15:02,324 --> 02:15:04,326
Of course it was Nick's fault.

1260
02:15:04,701 --> 02:15:08,205
If he hadn't mentioned it to you,
none of this would've happened.

1261
02:15:08,413 --> 02:15:11,124
I recommended that cocksucker
to those people...

1262
02:15:11,333 --> 02:15:14,294
...and he's made me look like
a complete asshole.

1263
02:15:19,091 --> 02:15:20,592
Victor?

1264
02:15:21,969 --> 02:15:23,887
What can I say?

1265
02:15:30,227 --> 02:15:31,603
I had...

1266
02:15:33,105 --> 02:15:34,648
...absolutely...

1267
02:15:35,607 --> 02:15:40,237
...no idea you were involved
in any way.

1268
02:15:41,655 --> 02:15:43,740
I know you didn't, Bill.

1269
02:15:45,659 --> 02:15:47,703
But I also know that you....

1270
02:15:48,704 --> 02:15:51,290
You went to Nick's hotel
this morning...

1271
02:15:51,540 --> 02:15:53,292
...and talked to the desk clerk.

1272
02:15:54,877 --> 02:15:56,503
How do you know that?

1273
02:15:58,505 --> 02:16:00,549
Because I had you followed.

1274
02:16:06,471 --> 02:16:08,181
You had me followed?

1275
02:16:10,559 --> 02:16:12,895
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1276
02:16:13,270 --> 02:16:15,188
All right? I owe you an apology.

1277
02:16:15,397 --> 02:16:18,150
This was for your own good, believe me.

1278
02:16:18,525 --> 02:16:22,529
I know what the desk clerk told you.
But what he didn't tell you is...

1279
02:16:22,779 --> 02:16:25,991
...all they did was
put Nick on a plane to Seattle.

1280
02:16:26,366 --> 02:16:30,162
By now he's probably back
with his family...

1281
02:16:30,704 --> 02:16:32,664
...banging Mrs. Nick.

1282
02:16:33,957 --> 02:16:37,210
The clerk said
he had a bruise on his face.

1283
02:16:39,296 --> 02:16:42,466
Okay, he had a bruise on his face.

1284
02:16:43,550 --> 02:16:46,511
That's a hell of a lot less
than he deserves.

1285
02:16:47,346 --> 02:16:51,475
I don't think you realize what
kind of trouble you were in last night.

1286
02:16:52,893 --> 02:16:55,020
Who do you think those people were?

1287
02:16:55,687 --> 02:16:57,814
Those were not just
ordinary people there.

1288
02:16:58,023 --> 02:17:01,360
If I told you their names--
I'm not gonna tell you their names...

1289
02:17:01,568 --> 02:17:05,322
...but if I did,
I don't think you'd sleep so well.

1290
02:17:08,951 --> 02:17:11,078
Was it the second password?

1291
02:17:12,454 --> 02:17:14,206
Is that what gave me away?

1292
02:17:16,333 --> 02:17:18,585
Yes, finally.

1293
02:17:20,712 --> 02:17:23,006
But not because you didn't know it.

1294
02:17:24,925 --> 02:17:27,844
It's because there was
no second password.

1295
02:17:29,054 --> 02:17:33,558
Of course it didn't help a whole lot
that those people arrive in limos...

1296
02:17:33,767 --> 02:17:36,269
...and you showed up in a taxi.

1297
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:40,232
Or that they found the receipt from
the rental house in your coat...

1298
02:17:40,440 --> 02:17:43,568
...made out to you-know-who.

1299
02:17:52,953 --> 02:17:54,579
There was a....

1300
02:17:58,625 --> 02:18:00,335
There was a....

1301
02:18:01,294 --> 02:18:04,756
There was a woman there...

1302
02:18:10,554 --> 02:18:12,348
...who tried to warn me.

1303
02:18:18,021 --> 02:18:19,272
I know.

1304
02:18:25,028 --> 02:18:26,779
Do you know who she was?

1305
02:18:32,118 --> 02:18:33,286
Yes.

1306
02:18:40,793 --> 02:18:42,503
She was a hooker.

1307
02:18:52,055 --> 02:18:53,723
Sorry, but...

1308
02:18:54,891 --> 02:18:56,893
...that's what she was.

1309
02:19:01,314 --> 02:19:02,482
A hooker.

1310
02:19:12,116 --> 02:19:13,326
Bill...

1311
02:19:17,330 --> 02:19:19,832
...suppose I told you...

1312
02:19:21,459 --> 02:19:24,378
...that everything that
happened to you there...

1313
02:19:25,880 --> 02:19:30,009
...the threats, the girl's warnings...

1314
02:19:30,218 --> 02:19:32,970
...her last-minute intervention...

1315
02:19:33,179 --> 02:19:36,974
...suppose I said that all of that...

1316
02:19:38,351 --> 02:19:41,020
...was staged.

1317
02:19:43,147 --> 02:19:47,026
That it was a kind of charade.

1318
02:19:48,611 --> 02:19:50,571
That it was fake.

1319
02:19:55,159 --> 02:19:56,536
Fake?

1320
02:19:58,287 --> 02:20:00,873
Yes. Fake.

1321
02:20:12,385 --> 02:20:14,303
Why would they do that?

1322
02:20:15,138 --> 02:20:16,389
Why?

1323
02:20:17,682 --> 02:20:19,392
In plain words...

1324
02:20:20,268 --> 02:20:22,812
...to scare the living shit out of you.

1325
02:20:23,980 --> 02:20:27,400
To keep you quiet
about where you'd been...

1326
02:20:27,900 --> 02:20:29,610
...and what you'd seen.

1327
02:20:49,714 --> 02:20:51,299
Have you seen this?

1328
02:21:08,649 --> 02:21:10,651
Yes, I have.

1329
02:21:16,115 --> 02:21:19,243
I saw her body in the morgue.

1330
02:21:23,748 --> 02:21:25,208
Was she...?

1331
02:21:28,044 --> 02:21:31,256
Was she the woman at the party?

1332
02:21:39,097 --> 02:21:40,349
Yes.

1333
02:21:43,560 --> 02:21:45,020
She was.

1334
02:21:55,864 --> 02:21:57,199
Victor...

1335
02:21:59,284 --> 02:22:01,870
...the woman lying dead in the morgue...

1336
02:22:03,872 --> 02:22:05,749
...was the woman at the party.

1337
02:22:08,168 --> 02:22:09,336
Yes.

1338
02:22:14,424 --> 02:22:19,304
Well, Victor, maybe I'm
missing something here.

1339
02:22:20,180 --> 02:22:23,684
You called it a fake, a charade.

1340
02:22:25,310 --> 02:22:28,689
Do you mind telling me
what kind of fucking charade...

1341
02:22:28,939 --> 02:22:32,776
...ends with somebody turning up dead?

1342
02:22:38,699 --> 02:22:43,328
Okay, Bill, let's cut the bullshit.
All right?

1343
02:22:43,537 --> 02:22:46,331
You've been way out of your depth
for the last 24 hours.

1344
02:22:46,581 --> 02:22:50,043
You want to know what kind of charade?
I'll tell you exactly what kind.

1345
02:22:51,295 --> 02:22:54,965
That whole play-acted,
"take me" phony sacrifice...

1346
02:22:55,173 --> 02:22:59,761
...that you've been jerking off with
had nothing to do with her real death.

1347
02:22:59,970 --> 02:23:03,598
Nothing happened after you left
that hadn't happened to her before.

1348
02:23:03,807 --> 02:23:06,852
She got her brains fucked out. Period.

1349
02:23:08,270 --> 02:23:12,691
When they took her home,
she was just fine...

1350
02:23:13,317 --> 02:23:15,068
...and the rest is in the paper.

1351
02:23:15,235 --> 02:23:18,947
She was a junkie. She OD'd.
There was nothing suspicious.

1352
02:23:19,156 --> 02:23:23,368
Her door was locked from the inside.
The police are happy. End of story.

1353
02:23:24,745 --> 02:23:29,708
Come on. It was always gonna be
just a matter of time with her.

1354
02:23:30,083 --> 02:23:31,710
Remember, you told her so yourself.

1355
02:23:31,918 --> 02:23:35,797
You remember, the one with the
great tits who OD'd in my bathroom?

1356
02:23:52,689 --> 02:23:56,818
Listen, Bill, nobody killed anybody.

1357
02:23:57,235 --> 02:23:59,905
Someone died. It happens all the time.

1358
02:24:01,365 --> 02:24:03,700
But life goes on.

1359
02:24:04,117 --> 02:24:05,535
It always does...

1360
02:24:05,786 --> 02:24:07,245
...until it doesn't.

1361
02:24:08,872 --> 02:24:10,749
But you know that, don't you?

1362
02:27:35,413 --> 02:27:37,915
I'll tell you everything.

1363
02:27:43,337 --> 02:27:45,631
I'll tell you everything.

1364
02:28:37,476 --> 02:28:39,686
Helena's gonna be up soon.

1365
02:28:56,578 --> 02:29:00,916
She's expecting us to
take her Christmas shopping today.

1366
02:29:25,649 --> 02:29:26,733
That's nice.

1367
02:29:26,983 --> 02:29:29,569
I could put Sabrina in here.

1368
02:29:30,320 --> 02:29:32,739
It's really pretty.

1369
02:29:32,948 --> 02:29:34,950
It's old-fashioned.

1370
02:29:44,084 --> 02:29:45,335
He's big.

1371
02:29:45,544 --> 02:29:48,964
I hope Santa Claus gets me
one of these for Christmas.

1372
02:29:49,172 --> 02:29:50,465
You do?

1373
02:29:52,759 --> 02:29:54,970
Well, you're gonna
have to wait and see.

1374
02:30:00,976 --> 02:30:02,102
Alice?

1375
02:30:09,109 --> 02:30:11,153
What do you think we should do?

1376
02:30:16,324 --> 02:30:17,784
What do I think we should do?

1377
02:30:18,034 --> 02:30:19,327
Look, Mommy!

1378
02:30:28,670 --> 02:30:31,339
What do I think?
I don't know.

1379
02:30:33,508 --> 02:30:35,302
I mean, maybe....

1380
02:30:47,314 --> 02:30:50,817
Maybe I think...

1381
02:30:51,526 --> 02:30:53,862
...we should be grateful.

1382
02:30:59,868 --> 02:31:01,453
Grateful...

1383
02:31:02,037 --> 02:31:07,042
...that we've managed to
survive through all of our...

1384
02:31:07,876 --> 02:31:09,586
...adventures...

1385
02:31:12,047 --> 02:31:14,382
...whether they were real...

1386
02:31:14,883 --> 02:31:17,135
...or only a dream.

1387
02:31:26,394 --> 02:31:30,233
Are you sure of that?

1388
02:31:34,153 --> 02:31:35,780
Am I sure?

1389
02:31:51,587 --> 02:31:53,339
Only as sure as I am...

1390
02:31:53,589 --> 02:31:57,426
...that the reality of one night...

1391
02:31:58,719 --> 02:32:01,597
...let alone that of a whole lifetime...

1392
02:32:04,100 --> 02:32:06,519
...can ever be the whole truth.

1393
02:32:13,276 --> 02:32:15,278
And no dream is ever...

1394
02:32:17,154 --> 02:32:18,948
...just a dream.

1395
02:32:27,415 --> 02:32:29,500
The important thing is...

1396
02:32:31,377 --> 02:32:33,129
...we're awake now...

1397
02:32:34,422 --> 02:32:36,757
...and hopefully...

1398
02:32:39,802 --> 02:32:42,013
...for a long time to come.

1399
02:32:45,683 --> 02:32:47,184
Forever.

1400
02:32:49,353 --> 02:32:50,813
Forever?

1401
02:32:53,149 --> 02:32:54,650
Forever.

1402
02:32:57,028 --> 02:33:00,656
Let's not use that word. You know?

1403
02:33:01,991 --> 02:33:03,951
It frightens me.

1404
02:33:14,211 --> 02:33:17,340
But I do love you...

1405
02:33:20,468 --> 02:33:22,178
...and you know...

1406
02:33:23,304 --> 02:33:25,473
...there is something very important...

1407
02:33:25,723 --> 02:33:28,434
...that we need
to do as soon as possible.

1408
02:33:29,769 --> 02:33:31,062
What's that?

1409
02:33:34,231 --> 02:33:35,691
Fuck.
