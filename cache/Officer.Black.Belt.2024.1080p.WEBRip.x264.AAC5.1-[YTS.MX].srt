FIRST PLACE
REGULAR PROMOTION TEST AWARD

4
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,167
Having fun is important to me.

5
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,878
Doing something fun makes me happy.

6
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,922
Happy people are healthy people,

7
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,716
which is why,

8
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,887
for the sake of my health and happiness,
I only do fun stuff.

9
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,518
And there's nothing I love more
than sports and e-sports.

10
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:02,729
Do you know why?

11
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,232
Because I always win.

12
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,380
The head!

13
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,770
The head!

14
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,241
Break!

15
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,283
Red wins!

16
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:58,910
Are you okay?

17
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,829
Great match.

18
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,122
Sure.

19
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,547
Enemy entering the compound.
One down. Another one down.

20
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,676
I'm down. Back me up quickly.

21
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,346
Hey! They're using smoke and moving in.
We can't keep them out.

22
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,973
-I'm down.
-I see one moving in.

23
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,143
-I'll throw a grenade. Fall back.
-Okay, I'm heading to the stairs.

24
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,937
Damn, I'm down.

25
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,272
They're closing in on you!

26
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,731
You're all dead meat.

27
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,151
Go, Diarrhea.

28
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,819
One down.

29
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,946
Be quiet, guys!

30
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,115
Quiet, you pricks!

31
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,242
One more down! I got them all!

32
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,037
DAD

33
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,081
Hey.

34
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,001
Okay, I'll come now. All right.

35
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,544
I'll be right back.

36
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,712
-Be quick.
-All right.

37
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,017
MIGHTY CHICKEN

38
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,232
-Be safe.
-Okay!

39
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,753
Hey, Auntie.

40
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,928
This is on the house.

41
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,431
Oh my. You read my mind.

42
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,684
Hey! Come get your roots done next week.

43
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,269
Should I?

44
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,565
Hey, I'm on my way now.

45
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,317
We're playing now.

46
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,777
Hurry up.

47
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,862
He wants you to hurry.

48
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,780
All right.

49
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,408
Stop. That's enough!

50
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,410
Fuck! Why are you messing with me?

51
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,334
Fuck you!

52
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,419
What do we have here?

53
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,965
You son of a bitch!

54
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,594
Come at me.

55
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,513
Bring it on. Goddamn it!

56
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,849
Son of a bitch.

57
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,271
Damn it! Get off me!

58
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,355
-Fuck, get off!
-Stop!

59
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,523
Fuck!

60
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,400
Let me…

61
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,111
Fine. I'll go.

62
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,701
Damn it.

63
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,370
I won't cuff you, so let's just go.

64
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,413
Okay.

65
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,625
Fuck!

66
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,502
Fuck you.

67
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,587
-Fuck!
-Hey now.

68
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,965
You son of a bitch!

69
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,264
All right, stop! Break it up!

70
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,266
He's hurt.

71
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,809
Who the fuck are you?

72
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,686
You son of a bitch.

73
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,732
-You piece of--
-Stop.

74
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,492
Who is this jerk?

75
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,707
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

76
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,418
-Thank you.
-No problem.

77
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,671
You helped us prevent a crisis.
Thank you so much.

78
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,006
Sure. No problem.

79
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,342
On the count of three.

80
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,052
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROBATION OFFICE

81
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,636
Three, two, one.

82
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,598
-His physique is impressive.
-I know.

83
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,975
-Thank you so much.
-My pleasure.

84
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,226
-Take care.
-Thank you.

85
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,688
This is my manager.

86
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,689
I see.

87
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,734
-Jung-do. It's so nice to meet you.
-Hello.

88
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,237
I'm Kim Sun-min, manager
of the Electronic Monitoring Division.

89
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,447
I see.

90
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,075
Could you spare a few minutes?

91
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:07,992
Sure.

92
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:14,499
There are about 5,000 ex-cons
wearing electronic ankle tags nationwide.

93
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:18,711
They've committed violent crimes
like sexual violence or homicide.

94
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,298
Their recidivism rate is high.
That's why probation officers like me…

95
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,883
MANAGER KIM SUN-MIN
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

96
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:28,221
…monitor them 24-7,
using GPS-enabled ankle monitors.

97
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,182
Then the guy I helped that day
must also be--

98
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:34,560
That was Mr. Cho,
our martial arts officer.

99
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,148
The ex-cons we monitor
cause trouble from time to time.

100
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,402
When that occurs,
we must rush to the scene promptly

101
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,071
and take care of it
to ensure public safety.

102
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,907
But middle-aged men
with beer bellies like me

103
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,911
aren't really capable of overpowering
or catching them, you know.

104
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:56,499
That's why each probation officer works
with a strong young partner.

105
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,669
We call them martial arts officers.

106
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,296
I see. "Martial arts officers."

107
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,716
What do you do for a living, Jung-do?

108
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,762
I work as a deliveryman
for my father's chicken joint.

109
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:15,810
Well, Mr. Cho said
it looked like you do tae kwon do or judo.

110
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,520
Is that true?

111
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:21,190
Yes. I'm a third dan
in both tae kwon do and judo.

112
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,316
Wow!

113
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,318
A third dan in kendo too.

114
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,531
Could I ask you a favor?

115
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,782
No.

116
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,078
Yes, of course. Ask away.

117
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,706
The thing is,

118
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:41,043
the martial arts officers in our division
are on a triple-shift rotation.

119
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,837
But with Mr. Cho injured,

120
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,842
the other two martial arts officers
must work 12-hour shifts for five weeks.

121
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,845
They'll work a 12-hour shift,

122
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:54,015
then return 12 hours later,
repeating the cycle.

123
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,392
-That's intense.
-Exactly.

124
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,270
Our work isn't easy.

125
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,939
Realistically, it's impossible
to find a replacement

126
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,775
for just the five weeks
Mr. Cho needs to recover.

127
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,904
But Mr. Cho told me

128
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,699
that when he saw you
take down the ex-con that day,

129
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:18,498
he thought it would be great
if you could lend us a hand.

130
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:22,001
Wait. But do I qualify?

131
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,755
You can apply
to become a martial arts officer

132
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:31,093
with a third dan or higher
in tae kwon do, kendo, judo, or hapkido.

133
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,304
You most definitely qualify, Jung-do.

134
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,097
But is it…

135
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,727
Well, is it fun? That's important to me.

136
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:46,108
The definition of "fun"
can be different for everyone.

137
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,902
But I promise you

138
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,530
that it's a rewarding job
that we're proud to do.

139
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,491
We're keeping innocent people safe,
you know?

140
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,621
Well, is that fun?

141
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,209
I think

142
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:09,382
you'll learn a lot while working with us.

143
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,387
I've researched extensively
for my stories.

144
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,515
People wearing ankle tags
are serious criminals.

145
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,518
Your job would be catching them,
so it might suit you well.

146
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,478
-Why?
-You love thrilling activities.

147
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,689
-I think you'd like it too.
-Right?

148
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,570
What's your take
on me as a martial arts officer?

149
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,657
-Triple shift sounds tough.
-Why would it be tough?

150
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,493
-It'll ruin his sleep cycle.
-Diarrhea is fit. He'll be fine.

151
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,412
-I'll be fine.
-It'd still be hard.

152
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,038
Can you stop being so indecisive?

153
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,623
How about you stop being bossy?

154
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,083
You're making me like that.

155
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,715
I'd have to go catch them
if things went south.

156
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,675
What do you think, Dad?

157
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,388
I'd be happy to see you
take on new challenges and learn.

158
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,975
You received a commendation.
I'm proud of you.

159
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,144
Really?

160
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,439
Give it a shot.

161
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,317
I'll manage this place. Don't worry.

162
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:15,781
All right.

SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROBATION OFFICE

164
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,584
Can I have your attention for a moment?

165
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:32,423
This is Mr. Lee Jung-do.
He'll help us while Mr. Cho is recovering.

166
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,550
Let's give him a warm round of applause.

167
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,010
Hello.

168
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,931
Meet Mr. Huh Dong-won,
our senior martial arts officer.

169
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,933
Hello.

170
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,145
Mr. Huh will show you
how to use the program.

171
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,063
Okay.

172
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,398
-Take good care of him.
-Don't worry, sir.

173
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,235
There. All those ex-cons
are under surveillance.

174
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,741
One of them raped a ten-year-old boy,

175
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,951
and another killed his own parents.

JANG HO-SIK
87%/HOMICIDE

177
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,667
When the ankle tag's battery drops to 30%,
these icons turn yellow.

178
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,755
Then we call them and ask them nicely
to recharge their ankle tags.

179
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:17,343
But what would you do
if they refused to recharge it?

180
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,221
Go there?

181
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,348
-Yes.
-Go there.

182
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,265
Right.

183
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,310
You'll be overwhelmed
if I explain everything now.

184
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,981
For now, if you're unsure of anything,
just ask Mr. Kim.

185
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:32,733
Okay.

186
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:33,734
Good.

187
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:51,001
I'm just calling
because your battery is at 30% now.

188
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,461
You should recharge it.

189
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,839
You're out with a friend? I see.

190
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,174
-He's doing better than expected.
-Really?

191
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,176
I'm so glad to hear that.

192
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:11,981

DATE OF BIRTH - MAY 24, 2003

195
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:16,736
He's 20?

196
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,281
How did it go?

197
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,742
I told Choi Jong-hwa to go home.

198
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:27,496
But he swore at me and pushed me,
so I had to struggle a little.

199
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,386
Hello?

200
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,264
Is this Mr. Lee Yang-ho?

201
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,515
-Yes.
-All right.

202
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,019
I'm calling to remind you
to recharge your ankle tag.

203
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,230
-Who is it, babe?
-I didn't order any jjajangmyeon.

204
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,690
Wait…

205
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,276
Jjajangmyeon?

206
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:58,861
REDIAL

207
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,283
The call got disconnected.

208
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,536
I heard you, motherfucker. Beat it.

209
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,079
Hello?

210
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,507
This phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

211
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,050
Extra charges may apply.

212
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,263
-Send a text.
-Yes, sir.

213
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,181
-And--
-Mr. Kim.

214
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,017
We should go.

215
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,894
What? Go where?

216
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:36,857
Mr. Lee Yang-ho hung up on me twice.

217
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,401
-When was he released?
-Three months ago.

218
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,363
He seemed to be behaving
when we talked last week.

219
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,949
-Give Jung-do what he needs.
-Yes, sir.

220
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,326
-Let's meet in the parking lot.
-Yes, sir.

221
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,540
-Come with me.
-Sure.

222
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,215
-A stab-proof vest.
-Right.

223
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,133
It's heavy.

224
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,639
Can this really stop a knife?

225
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,640
It prevents cuts,

226
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,767
but a strong stab
can still cause bruising.

227
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,937
Don't forget to turn on your bodycam
before moving in.

228
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,190
Here's your Taser.

229
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,069
Can I actually use it?

230
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,196
If Mr. Kim permits, yes.

231
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,698
Put it in here.

232
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,704
How did he end up in jail?

233
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,372
He raped a middle school girl.

234
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,875
Whoa.

235
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,755
Is it okay if I use the Taser?

236
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,591
Only if it's absolutely necessary.

237
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:49,388
Our priority is to monitor the ex-cons
and keep them out of trouble.

238
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,390
Right.

239
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,655
What is it, Jung-do?
Did you see something?

240
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,869
This is unit 201, where Lee Yang-ho lives.

241
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,457
I've delivered to many buildings,
so I get the gist with a glance.

242
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,419
If you take a look,
there are no security grilles.

243
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,463
Look. This unit has them.

244
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,757
He removed them intentionally to escape.

245
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,052
If you knock on his door,

246
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:32,765
he'll probably sneak out through here,
so I'll wait here and catch him.

247
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,017
What if he uses the door?

248
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,271
Then I'll run in right away.

249
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,107
Yes.

250
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,825
Hey, stop.

251
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,212
Lee Yang-ho.

252
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,173
-Open the door.
-It's nothing.

253
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,967
I know you're inside.

254
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,434
You're inside, right?

255
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,311
-Fucking bastard.
-I know what's up.

256
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,022
Yang-ho, I know you're…

257
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,023
Fuck.

258
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,359
You son of a bitch!

259
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,986
Fuck, I told you not to come.

260
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,904
-Help!
-You piece of shit.

261
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,322
-Open it, and you're dead!
-Open!

262
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,408
-Get lost, fucking asshole.
-Lee Yang-ho.

263
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,660
Open the door now!

264
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,036
No!

265
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,163
What is it? What's wrong?

266
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,583
Open the door! Open up!

267
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,628
Mister, please help me.

268
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,089
-Shit.
-Please.

269
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,492
That's dope!

270
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:20,789
Mr. Kim.

271
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:29,131
Lee Yang-ho, you are under arrest
for violating electronic monitoring terms

272
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,384
and disobeying
your probation officer's instructions.

273
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,304
You have the right to remain silent.

274
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,724
Anything you say can
and will be used against you in court.

275
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:42,603
You have the right to an attorney.

-What?

00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,698
-"What"?
-Yeah, what are you gonna do, huh?

-Calm down.

289
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,289
Calm down. You need to relax.

290

I'm not trying to provoke you, moron.
Show me what you've got!

297
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,487
Don't be. That was cool.

298
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,197

00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,700

How about a drink and some pork belly?

00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,205
I'm supposed to meet up with my friends.

301
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,290
Another time, then.

302
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,083
Could you take us all out for dinner?

303
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,838

I'm Writer K.
I've heard so much about you.

00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,782
I'm Kim Sun-min. It's nice to meet you.

313
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,952
Hello, I'm Moisture.
Thank you for inviting us.

314
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,581
My pleasure.
Anyway, why are you called "Moisture"?

315
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,460
His nose is always wet.
That's why he is Moisture.

316
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,004
No one knows whether it's sweat or grease.

317
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,797
I say it's half-sweat, half-grease.

318
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,801
-And this is Earthworm.
-"Earthworm"?

319
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,887
I only squirm when I'm stepped on.

320
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,557
He's too nice. He never gets angry.

321
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,352
All right, guys. Take a seat.

322
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,269
Okay.

323
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,938
-Please, sir.
-Yes, of course.

324
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,857
What are you in the mood for?

325
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:40,030
We can start with the savory combination
of water celery and pork belly,

326
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,491
move to the spicy kimchi stew
to cut the grease,

327
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,326
and end with the crispy fried rice.

328
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,579
I think it's a perfectly balanced meal
with carbs, protein, and fat.

329
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,666
-Order anything you want.
-Thank you.

330
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,917
No problem.

331
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,670
Like he was telling a story.

332
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,131
-Twenty servings?
-And five servings of kimchi stew.

333
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,677
-Twenty-five servings in total?
-Yes, including five servings of stew.

334
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,180
Let me pour you one.

335
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,766
I don't have the enzymes
to break down alcohol.

336
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,435
But I party harder than the drunk.

337
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,145
Okay, all right. Here.

338
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,188
Thank you.

339
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,732
It's so nice to meet you, Moisture.

340
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,192
-Earthworm too.
-Likewise.

341
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,863
-All right, shall we drink?
-Yes.

342
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,366
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

343
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:33,417
I did some research on probation officers
while working on a script some time ago.

344
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,334
Right. I see.

345
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:38,255
It's a very stressful job
that involves dangerous tasks.

346
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,382
Why did you decide to become one?

347
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,677
I was in a car accident when I was little.

348
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,097
You see, our car wasn't even moving.

349
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,892
But this car came out of nowhere
and crashed into ours!

350
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:56,023
The rear doors caved in,
and I couldn't move as my legs were stuck.

351
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,818
Then the engine caught fire.

352
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,486
I was only ten.

353
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,032
A ten-year-old boy thought he was dying.

354
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,783
"Is this how I die?"

355
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:10,579
"If I'd known I'd end up like this,
I would've played more games!"

356
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,665
I had my money from New Years
saved up in a drawer.

357
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,126
I couldn't stop thinking about it!

358
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,004
Anyway, at that moment,

359
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:25,510
some cops showed up
and tore the door off to save me.

360
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,973
So I told myself
I'd become a police officer

361
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:34,561
to save people
and repay the favor I had received.

362
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:39,649
But the accident damaged
the growth plate in my left leg,

363
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,443
so it's shorter than my right leg.

364
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,947
I knew I wouldn't be able to run around
to catch criminals,

365
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,077
so I did a lot of thinking
to figure out what I could do.

366
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,497
That's when I learned
about probation officers.

367
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:58,668
Contributing to reducing recidivism
deeply motivated me.

368
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:04,216
After I got married and became a father,
my job became even more meaningful to me.

369
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,467
Why is that?

370
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:10,222
Several of the ex-convicts we monitor
are child sex offenders.

371
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:15,644
I want to build a world where children
are always safe and protected.

372
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,371
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

373
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,248
Let's do this.

374
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,210
You know, what we want

375
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,213
is to call you our big brother.

376
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,297
Garlic too.

377
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,592
But in order to do so,
you have to pass a test first.

378
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,177
Add some more.

379
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:54,182
This lettuce wrap is filled
with loyalty, friendship, and sincerity.

380
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,561
All you have to do
is eat this in one bite.

381
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,146
Open up.

382
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,365
Big bro!

383
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,033
This is way too big!

384
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,328
Big bro!

385
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,848
LOW BATTERY DETECTED

386
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,684
HAN JUN-GU
30%/KIDNAPPING

387
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,733
This phone is turned off. Please leave--

388
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,694
Han Jun-gu's battery is at 30%,
but his phone is off.

389
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,282
What is this?

390
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,825
Who is it?

391
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,036
MIN DO-WOONG

392
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,246
Thank you for such a great meal.

393
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,082
-What are you guys doing?
-Thanks for the dinner, big bro!

394
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,334
You're making me blush.

395
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,253
You'd really be going wild
if I had treated you to beef.

396
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,549
ASSISTANT MANAGER YOON DONG-JU

397
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,010
Hey.

398
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,012
Sir, where are you?

399
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:14,971
What's up?

400
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:18,517
An ex-con is unreachable,
so we have to go to Bukrin-dong.

401
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,687
But Min Do-woong from Seorin-dong
is out and about after curfew.

402
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,772
He's not answering.

403
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,275
I'm actually in Seorin-dong now,
so I'll go.

404
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,237
What did Min Do-woong do time for?

405
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,490
Involuntary manslaughter, 20 years.
He was released three months ago.

406
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,951
Does he have a grudge
against someone in Seorin-dong?

407
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,954
I haven't figured that out yet. I'm sorry.

408
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,789
Okay. Got it.

409
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,418
Big bro, we can get there
in five minutes if we run.

410
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,506
One minute will do.

411
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,392
CRIME CATEGORY - MANSLAUGHTER

412
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,439
You guys stay in the car. It's dangerous.

413
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,024
-Yes, sir.
-We'll be back.

414
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:14,948
-That way.
-Okay.

415
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,583
What's happening?

416
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,293
He cut the tag off.

417
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,335
How do we find him?

418
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,379
-Let's go see.
-Okay.

419
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,216
Hey, over here.

420
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,179
He cut it off with a knife.

421
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,941
Should we call the cops?

422
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,068
No, he must be close. Let's find him fast.

423
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,697
Hey, Moisture has a drone.
Why don't we use it?

424
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,325
-Would it help?
-Let's give it a shot.

425
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,293
-You can view it here.
-Okay.

426
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,176
Here.

427
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,969
-Can you fly it here?
-Yes.

428
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:23,975
That must be him.

429
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,727
Where's he going?

430
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,356
-I'll go after him.
-I'll come with you.

431
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,900
No, I'll run over there and get him.

432
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,777
He's carrying a knife.

433
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,654
Don't worry about that.

434
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,201
A martial arts officer
must protect their probation officer.

435
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,244
I'll go.

436
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,497
What a fool.

437
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,459
Use the earbud. I'll give you directions.

438
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,377
Okay.

439
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,045
I'll be back!

440
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,463
Be careful.

441
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,681
Go straight. Keep going straight.

442
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,640
Make a left turn.

443
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,392
You went past it. Go back.

444
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:14,901
Hurry.

445
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,699
Jung-do. I'm really sorry,
but can you run a little faster?

446
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,284
You're almost there.

447
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,413
A little faster.
You can get him. Turn right there.

448
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,498
On your right…

449
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,166
On my right? Where?

450
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,543
Where? This way?

451
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,294
See the two buildings with rooftops?

452
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,380
He's right behind them.

453
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,381
Two rooftops?

454
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,549
Don't you see them?

455
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,260
One, two. Okay, got it.

456
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,857
Hey, bastard!
Come out, you son of a bitch!

457
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,610
Come out!

458
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,863
Ji Hyeok-jun, you bastard!

459
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,364
Come out, asshole!

460
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,199
I'll kill you! Come out!

461
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,744
Min Do-woong!

462
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,415
Who are you?

463
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,709
I'm…

464
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,881
I'm a martial arts officer.

465
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:19,883
Get lost.

466
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,136
I'm here to finish it all off.

467
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,056
That's why I'm here.

468
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,018
Let's go back quietly.

469
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,686
That's right.

470
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,204
Jung-do, what's wrong?
Jung-do, are you all--

471
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:53,833
You little…

472
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,429
You can come now.

473
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,099
Okay, I'm coming now.

474
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,605
Shit.

475
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,690
Hey!

476
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,985
Get lost, or I'll kill myself.

477
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,032
Bro, I need your help.

478
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,661
What's going on?

479
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,330
He's holding a knife to his own throat.

480
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,965
Hey, Jung-do. I need you to be my voice.

481
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:42,966
Sorry?

482
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,927
Repeat my exact words to him.

483
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,303
Leave!

484
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,305
Okay.

485
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,182
Mr. Min Do-woong.

486
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,893
"Mr. Min Do-woong."

487
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,105
You must've had a bad day.

488
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,401
"You must've had a bad day."

489
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:09,033
Did you get into a fight with a friend?

490
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,829
"Did you get into a fight with a friend?"

491
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:25,466
I'm trying really hard
to lead a good life.

492
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,220
But that son of a bitch

493
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:34,183
kept mocking me about my ankle tag
in front of everyone.

494
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:39,939
It's not fair. It makes me so angry
that I can't even sleep.

495
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,610
I'll kill that son of a bitch,

496
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,029
and kill myself too!

497
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,697
Mr. Min.

498
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,490
"Mr. Min."

499
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:55,538
"You were exhausted,
yet still had to endure such insults."

500
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,542
I understand why
you want to give up on everything.

501
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,211
"But if you do,

502
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,966
don't you think
spending more than 20 years repenting

503
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,510
would have been in vain?"

504
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,478
Let's just say you were upset today,
and had too much to drink.

505
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:23,274
I'll write a favorable report
so you receive just a minor penalty.

506
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,568
"I'll do my best."

507
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,324
"So please put down the knife."

508
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,747
You must not repeat the same mistake.

509
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,416
"To persevere is to win."

510
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,419
"Hang in there a little longer."

511
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,714
"Your ankle tag will be removed one day."

512
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,302
"I'll stay by your side
and help you until then."

513
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,305
I mean it.

514
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:57,934
"I mean it."

515
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,454
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

516
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,791
-How was work?
-Not too bad.

517
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,254
Well, my manager…

518
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,257
He's a really

519
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:31,592
good guy.

520
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:34,887
Good.

521
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,932
-Wash up quickly and have an apple.
-All right.

522
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,310
Kang Ki-jung managed
to evade the police for four years…

523
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,688
KWON IL-YONG
FORMER POLICE PROFILER

524
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,231
…starting in May 1998,

525
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:50,278
and sexually assaulted
15 girls under the age of 13.

526
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,864
What a scoundrel.

527
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:58,244
…and has a history
of over ten convictions,

528
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:01,330
so we can say
that Kang has a higher risk of recidivism,

529
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,959
even compared to other sex offenders.

530
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,920
How should we organize the task force?

531
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,006
We need three teams,

532
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:13,176
with a probation officer
and a martial arts officer on each,

533
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,344
on a triple-shift rotation
to monitor Kang.

534
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,596
A triple-shift rotation?

535
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:21,809
Each probation officer has to monitor
over 20 ex-convicts at the moment.

536
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,729
If we monitor Kang Ki-jung on top of that,

537
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:28,024
we won't be able
to closely monitor the others.

538
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,902
I know you're all working very hard.

539
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:35,281
The problem is that it isn't easy
to increase the budget,

540
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,033
but I'll push harder for it.

541
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,623
Thank you. Come again. Have a nice day.

542
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,048
Hey, Auntie.

543
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,097
I'm very well, thank you.

544
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,977
Do you want to bleach your roots today?

545
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,191
Then what do you want to do?

546
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,569
I want a clean cut, Auntie.

Yes.

You changed your hairstyle.

-I did.
-Nice. It looks great.

I saw this man on my way here.

A moment, please.

566
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:12,271
I saw him tip a young female server
and touch her hand.

567
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,607
He's on the move now.
Shouldn't we head there?

568
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,988
Maybe he's on his way home.

-Let's try calling him.
-Yes, sir.

I'm gonna do
whatever the fuck I want tonight.

571
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,093
We have a problem. Hurry!

572
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:47,974
What?

573
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:49,558
Did he cut it off?

574
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,978
I think he went into a place

581
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,291
Which way did he go?

Left or right?

583
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,171
I didn't see which way.

584
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,051
He said it was his birthday today
and invited me to his place,

585

Got it!

593
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:48,117
If it gets too hot, just let me know.

00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,120
-Hello.
-Excuse me.

595
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:53,039
You're okay, right?

596
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,123
Sorry?

597
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,083
No, never mind. Stay inside.

What do you need?

00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,468
Why did you lock the door?

What do you want?

601
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,727
You did fucking tell me to come again.

602
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,696
Auntie!

00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,073

605
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,132
Okay.

606
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,301
Goddamn it!

607
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,470
Damn it.

608
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,116
Hey! Damn it.

00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:09,944
You're…

611
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,655
Against you.

612
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,663
The world's against you.

613
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,375
And you have the right.

614
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,094
Auntie.

615
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,346
Are you all right?

616
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,681
I'm sorry I was late.

617
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,351
I'm sorry.

618
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,894
No, it's okay.

619
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,526
Thanks.

620
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,028
Thanks.

621
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,969
-There you are.
-What?

622
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,345
Why are you up already?

623
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,264
I made breakfast for you. Come sit down.

624
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:23,767
Seriously?

625
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:27,062
Sun-jung dropped by the joint
and praised you.

626
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,064
Did her face look okay?

627
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,985
Well, it looked a little swollen,
but I think it's okay.

628
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,904
That's good to hear.

629
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,156
-Try it.
-All right.

630
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,326
I'm not sure how it'll taste.

631
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:47,666
It's good.

632
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,251
-Does it taste all right?
-Yeah.

633
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,586
Dad.

634
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,757
When you were my age,
what made you happiest?

635
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,554
When I was your age…

636
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,058
acting on stage made me happiest.

637
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,811
Gathering together to rehearse.

638
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,897
Sweating and exchanging lines.

639
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,649
All that hard work.

640
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:17,946
There's this joy
in seeing my work make others happy.

641
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:22,826
No matter how much fun you have alone,
nothing beats that joy.

642
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,791
There's this energy you feel

643
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,586
when the passion from your heart
reaches someone else's.

644
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,171
That's my biggest joy.

645
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:50,688
Two probation officers will be sent
to the task force handling Kang,

646
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:55,526
and we're approved to budget
for two more martial arts officers.

647
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:58,612
I asked for extra manpower
to implement the triple-shift rotation,

648
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,155
but it was declined.

649
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:01,824
I'm sorry.

650
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,954
Fourteen of the fifteen
sexual offenses committed by Kang

651
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,998
occurred immediately before
or after school hours.

652
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,751
The daytime probation officer's role
is crucial.

653
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,171
I'll work the daytime shifts.

654
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,551
But will you be okay with 12-hour shifts?

655
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,010
You have a kid at home.

656
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,015
I'll treat it
like I were protecting my own child.

657
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:32,563
Hello.

658
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,273

-Aren't you on the night shift today?
-Could I have a moment?

662
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:42,781
Go on ahead.

663
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:43,866

-Yeah.

666
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,206
Yeah.

667
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,625
I want more of it.

668
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,628
-Seriously?
-Yes.

00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,049

670
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,802
Ten days from now,

671
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:07,264
I'm moving to the team handling
Kang Ki-jung, a serial sex offender.

672
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,144

673
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:17,065
Bro, if you want me,
I'll go anywhere with you!

674
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,693
Hey. With you, I'm invincible!

675
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,285
Kang Ki-jung will be released today

676
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:31,622
after serving 20 years
for sexually assaulting 15 children.

677
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:35,834

679
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:38,921

680
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,091
-Try it on.
-Is this mine?

681
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,096

686
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,810
Mr. Kang, you must never
intentionally take any action

687
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,104
that could remove, damage,
or disable the ankle tag,

688
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,941
such as using jamming signals,
manipulating data, or anything else.

689
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:44,862
After your release, you may be
under constant watch or be tracked

690
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,321
by our probation officers.

691
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,322
Do you understand?

692
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,074
Yes.

693
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,034
Put your preferred foot on the stool.

694
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,345
Now, put on your shoes and stand up.

695
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,811
You can use this
until you get your own phone.

696
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:28,780
We're leaving now.

Child sex offender Kang Ki-jung

698
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,209
after completing a 20-year sentence.

699
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,630
Many locals and civic groups
have been waiting outside his house

700
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,131
since early this morning.

701
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:50,344
The police are preparing to prevent
any possible altercations.

702
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,638
Castrate Kang Ki-jung!

703
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,017
This is dangerous. Please stay calm.

704
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,936
Move aside. It's dangerous.

705
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,021
Give him the death penalty!

706
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,488
-It's dangerous. Make way.
-Just die!

707
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,324
Give Kang Ki-jung the death penalty!

708
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:19,581
Hey! Do we pay taxes
so rapists like him can get a ride home?

709
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:20,624
Fuck no!

710
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:25,420
Death penalty!

711
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,634
What? Why are you grabbing me?

712
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,844
You should be grabbing sex offenders!

713
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,058
Death penalty!

714
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,644
Please move back. Stop pushing!

715
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,397
Hey! Fuck!

716
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,065
Stay back. Don't push.

717
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,525
Let go!

718
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,947
-Move out of the way.
-How dare you come here.

719
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,203
Mr. Kang, do you have a message
for your victims?

720
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,204
Hey, block them.

721
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,497
Mr. Kang!

722
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,915
-Walk faster.
-Mr. Kang!

723
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,292
Please answer my question, Mr. Kang.

724
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:08,922
Give us an answer!

Come on. Move it.

727
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,390
-Just shove him in there.
-Let's go inside.

This neighborhood was once peaceful.

I know, right?

731
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:33,447
All clear?

732
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,698
Yes, I think so.

733
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,868
Officer Lee.
Let's patrol this block again.

734
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,869
Yes, sir.

735
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,289
-Did you see him?
-He was a big guy.

736
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,416
He has an intimidating face as well.

737
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:47,711
All the residents in this area
must be terrified to live here.

738
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,402
Look at you.

739
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,905
You've beefed up.

740
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,532
I had nothing to do but work out.

741
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,788
Put this on. It's a trendy jacket.

742
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,922
Let's go up for a smoke.

743
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,548
Damn you, dude.

744
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:38,011
Hey, I wore one for three years.

745
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:41,556
Movement within a building
can't be detected.

746
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,559
In fact, you can move
within a ten meter range.

747
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:48,313
GPS isn't that accurate.

748
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:10,127
Have you considered
what I wrote in my letter?

749
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,464

Why don't I tail him?

00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,911
-Now?
-Yeah.

755
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,914
Frankly, it'll be too late
if we wait for trouble.

756
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:57,174
It's important you don't get hurt,
so keep your earbud in.

757
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,550
I'll be watching.

758
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,260
Okay.

759
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:03,889
No sign of him.

760
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:08,810
Kang is still walking.
Let me know if you spot him.

761
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:09,728
I will.

762
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,361
I think I found him.

763
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,322
Excuse me. Please turn right.

764
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,239
Sure.

765
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,659
Please slow down. Drive slowly.

766
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,956
He is entering a building now.

767
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,208
I'll get out here.

768
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,709
Okay. Be careful.

769
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,254
-Thank you, sir.
-You're welcome.

770
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,528
I lost him.

771
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,489
What do you see around you?

772
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,704
The upper floors are filled
with children's learning centers.

773
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,292
It's too early
for any kids to have arrived.

774
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,752
I don't think he went up.

775
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,213
I'll check downstairs.

776
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,372
I'll get straight to the point.

777
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,376
I distribute very specific video content
on the dark web.

778
00:54:57,335 --> 00:55:03,174
If you provide me with videos of children,
I will distribute them on the dark web.

779
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,177
You'll earn ten million won
per ten-minute video.

780
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:12,392
Byung-soon will help you record
and edit the videos.

781
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:16,062
And we'll find the children
for this content.

782
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:17,981
You have…

783
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:20,942
nothing to lose.

784
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,154
Sounds good.

785
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,451
Someone's here.

786
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,330
Who is he?

787
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:36,374
He must have followed me
by tracking my ankle tag.

788
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,501
He can't see you from outside,
so don't move.

789
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,837
Jung-do. Are you okay?

790
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,173
Yes, I'm fine. I'm still looking.

791
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,316
Five times five is 25.

792
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:04,569
I'm all right.

793
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:11,368
I think that prick saw our license plate.
You can take care of him, right?

794
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,578
I'll take care of him quietly.

00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,625
What's going on?

796
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:22,212
I can't find him.
The place is huge. What should I do?

797
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,465
Jung-do. I'll call Kang Ki-jung.

798
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,425
I'll put it on speaker. Listen carefully.

00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,426

802
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,745
I'm from the probation office.

803

Yes, hello.

804
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:01,042
It took you a while to answer the phone.

805
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,420
I do apologize.

806
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:06,714
I'm not familiar with cell phones,
so I didn't realize you called.

807
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,008
I see.

808
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,762
Could you tell me where you are now?

809
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,312
I stepped out to have some gimbap.

810
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:25,775
I see. Gimbap?

811
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,278
I'll go there now. Buy me some time.

812
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,113
You see,

813
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:35,493
Mr. Kang, I wanted to ask
about the ankle tag we provided.

814
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,245
If it feels uncomfortable,

815
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:39,330
we can adjust the fit for you.

816
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,499
Did you find it uncomfortable?

817
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,543
No, it's fine.

818
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:52,093
We can also offer support and resources
to assist with your job search.

819
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,012
What type of job are you looking for?

820
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:55,054
No, I'm good.

821
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,646
He's in the gimbap shop.

822
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:06,733
I understand.

823
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,526
I hope you enjoy your meal.

824
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:12,238
Please make sure
to answer your phone promptly from now on.

825
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,740
Sorry about that.

826
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:15,492
All right. Thank you.

827
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:16,409
Take care.

828
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,121
I checked on my way back.

829
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,374
There are many gimbap shops
near Kang's house.

830
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,461
-I could hear his mind racing.
-Yeah.

831
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,046
It's making me uneasy.

832
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,548
We can't tail him like this every time.

833
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,426
I know, but I'll give it my best.
I'll go again.

834
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:38,973

835
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,391

-Hello.

-Look who's here!
-Welcome back.

00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:46,272
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

838
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,732
I'll be back to work tomorrow.

839

843
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,577
It's for you. I thought you might need it.

844
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,746

845
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,331

If you're in here,
they'll think your ankle tag is at home.

859
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:24,871
Shouldn't we seal the door and windows
to keep the sound in?

860

Don't worry about that.

01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,425
Is he here to fight?

890
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,677
You're fucked, you fucking prick.

891
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,262
You little shit.

892
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:31,974
I told you I'd kill you,
fucking son of a bitch.

893
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,143
What are you looking at?

894
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,437
-We should get out of here. Run!
-Come here!

895
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:46,239
Wow, I'm so scared.

896
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:49,951
Fucking bastard!

897
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:57,625
Hey, get him!

898
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,210
Fucking hell! Son of a bitch!

899
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:00,962
Fuck!

900
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,550
That son of a bitch!

901
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,197
Hey! You fucking asshole!

902
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:32,326
-Fuck!
-Min-jo!

903
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,370
-Just get out of here, sir!
-Min-jo!

904
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:40,960
I said I'd kill you, fucking moron.

905
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:59,770
Fucking idiot! You son of a bitch!

906
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:01,063
Fuck, you little shit!

907
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:13,910
Are you dead? Hey.

908
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:17,079
You fucker. I'm not done with you yet,
you son of a--

909
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,666
Sir, are you all right?

910
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:22,585
I'm okay.

911
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:26,797
You idiot! Get him.

912
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:27,924
You motherfucker!

913
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:30,593
Fucking bastard!

914
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,348
You son of a bitch!

915
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:36,766
You dumb fuck.

916
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:46,400
You bastard!

917
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:49,236
-You son of a bitch!
-Get him!

918
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,030
-You fucker!
-Corner him!

919
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:52,698
Fucking bastard!

920
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:55,159
Try that again!

921
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,014
-Damn it!
-Fuck!

922
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:35,825
Hey, you son of a bitch!

923
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:40,538
Hurry up and go after him!

924
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:03,519
Die.

925
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:08,607
You prick.

926
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,582
Motherfucker!

927
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:49,690
You shithead!

928
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:54,487
Is that all you got, fucker?

929
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,008
BIG BRO SUN-MIN

930
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:31,107
The person you are calling
is not available. Please leave--

931
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:27,413
Here comes Actor K.

932
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:23,844
Excuse me! Did something happen?

933
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,889
Call the police now!

934
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:27,806
Okay!

935
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:18,125
Fuck!

936
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:09,218
Die!

937
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:43,669
It's okay.

938
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:46,380
You're okay now.

939
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:12,281
Let's go! Let's get out of here!

940
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:13,615
Let go, you moron!

941
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:16,368
Shit, we're fucked.

942
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,745
There! It's over there.

943
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:31,633
Kang Ki-jung, freeze. Move, and I'll fire.

944
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:32,634
I said freeze!

945
01:14:41,768 --> 01:14:43,020
I'll shoot if you move!

946
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:59,244
Patrol 15. An unidentified man
and an officer are hurt.

947
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:02,414
Kang Ki-jung is on the run.
Send backup immediately.

948
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,166
Sir, are you all right?

949
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:06,251
Which division are you in?

950
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,253
Martial arts officer.

951
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:20,140
Hello, Mr. Lee.

952
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:22,017
I'm Han Dong-hoon. I called you.

953
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,810
I see. Hello.

954
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:25,896
What happened?

955
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:28,190
He was stabbed at the scene.

956
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,235
Stabbed? What do you mean?

957
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:33,028
We're really sorry.

958
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:39,743
Jung-do. Hey, Jung…

959
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:42,246
Jung-do.

960
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,716
You said it was a minor injury.

961
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,261
You call a stabbing injury "minor"?

962
01:15:57,344 --> 01:15:58,262
My apologies.

963
01:15:58,762 --> 01:16:01,139
I didn't want you to be too worried.

964
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,766
That's why I said it.

965
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:06,061
Why did my son go to a place
where someone was swinging a knife?

966
01:16:06,144 --> 01:16:07,354
We apologize.

967
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:10,482
Dad.

968
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:15,571
Jung-do.

969
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:17,281
Are you okay?

970
01:16:22,452 --> 01:16:24,079
Has Kang Ki-jung been captured?

971
01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:31,086
He cut his ankle tag off and fled,
so the police issued an APB.

972
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:34,715
The police are trying to find him,
so we'll get him soon.

973
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:36,675
What about the girl?

974
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:38,594
She's safe.

975
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:44,891
What about Mr. Kim?

976
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:56,903
He broke his neck
and is currently in surgery.

977
01:16:58,405 --> 01:17:02,826
Won't that cause full-body paralysis?

978
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:06,496
Thankfully, his nerves weren't affected,
so he's going to be okay.

979
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:12,085
It'll take him a while to recover though.

980
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:20,469
Jung-do.

981
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:25,057
Mr. Cho…

982
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,268
was declared brain-dead.

983
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:32,564
The police are investigating now.

984
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:35,692
He suffered

985
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:38,779
a cardiac arrest on-site.

986
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:51,750
He had given consent

987
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:55,504
for organ donation after death,

988
01:17:56,129 --> 01:17:59,800
and his family
wishes to honor his decision.

989
01:18:34,167 --> 01:18:37,087
That concludes
the Brave Citizen Award Ceremony.

990
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,922
Thank you all for joining us today.

991
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:41,675
THE 2023 BRAVE CITIZEN AWARD CEREMONY

992
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:45,721
Excuse me.

993
01:18:47,472 --> 01:18:50,350
I'm Min-ju's aunt.

994
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,185
Oh, she's…

995
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:54,146
Yes, that's right.

996
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:57,107
Nice to meet you.

997
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:59,568
I apologize for not visiting you sooner.

998
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:01,278
Please don't worry about it.

999
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:06,158
I came to thank you for saving Min-ju.

1000
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:11,747
Thank you.

1001
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:13,999
And one more thing.

1002
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:18,545
Min-ju asked me to give this to you.

1003
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,266
HELLO, UNCLE
I'M MIN-JU, THE GIRL YOU SAVED

1004
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:33,769
BEFORE YOU SHOWED UP, I WAS REALLY SCARED

1005
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:39,065
I THOUGHT I'D NEVER SEE MY PARENTS AGAIN

1006
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:41,026
BUT THANKS TO YOU, I COULD SEE THEM AGAIN

1007
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:42,778
YOU EVEN GOT HURT SAVING ME
THANK YOU

1008
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,197
Is Min-ju all right?

1009
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:50,869
She's still too scared to leave the house.

1010
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:54,623
She says she keeps dreaming about it.

1011
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,920
But when I tell her about you, Mr. Lee,

1012
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,965
she perks up and tries to stay strong.

1013
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:10,305
Thank you again for saving Min-ju.

1014
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:17,020
Many believe the punishment
for serial sex offender Kang Ki-jung…

1015
01:20:17,103 --> 01:20:18,188
KANG KI-JUNG ON THE LOOSE

1016
01:20:18,271 --> 01:20:19,439
…was too lenient.

1017
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:21,691
What's your take, Professor?

1018
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:24,444
It is true
that our penalties for sex crimes

1019
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:26,863
are much lighter
than those in other countries.

1020
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:27,823
Right.

1021
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:29,741
A few years ago, there were attempts…

1022
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:30,659
Hey, man.

1023
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,328
-I'm back.
-Have some pizza.

1024
01:20:33,411 --> 01:20:34,538
No, I'm not hungry.

1025
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:37,457
…concerned it might lead
to excessive punishment.

1026
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:42,128
We can all agree that sexual assault,
especially sex crimes against children,

1027
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:46,383
should never be tolerated or forgiven,
regardless of the circumstances.

1028
01:20:46,466 --> 01:20:47,551
Bro.

1029
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:49,594
You know the girl who was taken by Kang?

1030
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,055
I met her aunt today.

1031
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,808
I heard she was too scared
to leave the house.

1032
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:58,186
She did nothing wrong.

1033
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:02,524
Kang Ki-jung raped children
while evading the police

1034
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:03,733
for over four years.

1035
01:21:06,152 --> 01:21:07,654
He won't get caught easily.

1036
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,240
I know how you feel.

1037
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:13,535
But you're already injured.

1038
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,329
You can't get hurt again.

1039
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:19,833
Leave it to the police.

1040
01:21:26,506 --> 01:21:27,340
Hey, guys.

1041
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:31,011
Shouldn't we try to do what we can?

1042
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:33,805
I thought the same thing
when I heard that.

1043
01:21:34,514 --> 01:21:35,348
Yeah.

1044
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:37,309
Even the police can't track him down.

1045
01:21:38,101 --> 01:21:39,519
Can we really help?

1046
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:41,938
Yes, that's why we should help.

1047
01:21:42,522 --> 01:21:44,524
A lot of criminals
are caught by civilians.

1048
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:48,403
While tailing Kang, I saw a car,

1049
01:21:48,486 --> 01:21:50,906
but I couldn't see
through the tinted windows.

1050
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:52,824
It's been bothering me.

1051
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:54,910
Car make? Plate number?

1052
01:21:56,536 --> 01:21:59,205
A black Range Rover, 100-TA-5525.

1053
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:00,498
"100-TA-5525."

1054
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:02,292
All right, I'll ask my bro.

1055
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:06,880
I'll be out of here next week,
so get me some equipment too.

1056
01:22:06,963 --> 01:22:08,340

It'll be useful.

01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:16,992
All right.

1070
01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:20,745
Hey!

1071
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:22,288
Can you open it?

1072
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:23,957
I saw it on YouTube.

1073
01:23:24,874 --> 01:23:25,875
Good.

1074
01:23:29,879 --> 01:23:31,715
-Hey, what happened?
-Shit.

1075
01:23:33,216 --> 01:23:34,050
I'll try again.

1076
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:38,763
What? What is this?

1077
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:41,433
Hey, let's get out of here.

1078
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:45,103
What's going on? For fuck's sake.

1079
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:14,924
BRO

1080
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:15,884
Hey, I got it.

1081
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,138
Yeah, I got it.

1082
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,437
MY LITTLE BRO

1083
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:34,736
I see a shit ton of files.

1084
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:43,244
20130924_F_LONG HAIR

1085
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,039
What the fuck is this?

1086
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:49,626
On this bastard's computer,
there are videos of kids that…

1087
01:24:51,294 --> 01:24:52,128
Guys.

1088
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:55,632
He has over a terabyte
of child sexual abuse files.

1089
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:00,053
Give me the Taser.

1090
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:01,846
-Now!
-Okay.

1091
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:05,308
Hey, Jung-do.

1092
01:25:08,895 --> 01:25:10,897
Did you get Kang Ki-jung
to film the videos?

1093
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:13,650
Where is he now?

1094
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:16,444
Go on. Tase me.

1095
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:18,113
You don't think I can?

1096
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:19,030
Do it.

1097
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:22,367
-Fucking bastard.
-Jung-do! Don't!

1098
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:23,993
-Let go.
-No.

1099
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:25,036
-Let go of me!
-Stop.

1100
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,329
Calm down, Jung-do.

1101
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:27,831
Calm down.

1102
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:29,499
Let go of me. Let go!

1103
01:25:29,582 --> 01:25:30,750
No, calm down.

1104
01:25:38,341 --> 01:25:39,300
Shut up and relax.

1105
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:46,516
I can't believe
you actually used it on him.

1106
01:25:46,599 --> 01:25:48,810
I see blood from his eye.
What if he loses his sight?

1107
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:51,521
Hey, I told you not to do it.

1108
01:25:54,023 --> 01:25:54,941
Hold on.

1109
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:01,698
Look at your eye.

1110
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:07,495
If you don't go to the hospital,
you may lose your sight.

1111
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:12,041
If you tell us where Kang is,
I'll call you an ambulance.

1112
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:21,384
Nod if you wanna talk.

1113
01:26:29,392 --> 01:26:30,435
Let's sit him up.

1114
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:41,863
Tell us now.

1115
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:46,826
I have a debit card linked
to a puppet account.

1116
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:48,620
Kang's using that card now.

1117
01:26:50,246 --> 01:26:51,206
On my phone,

1118
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:54,834
you'll see text messages
that tell you where he used the card.

1119
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:56,794
About an hour ago…

1120
01:26:58,796 --> 01:27:00,048
I received a text.

1121
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:02,300
You'll find him there.

1122
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:03,426
CHINESE PAVILION

1123
01:27:03,509 --> 01:27:07,555
I've told you everything,
so please hurry up with the ambulance!

1124
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:13,561
Has Kang sent you any videos
in the past four weeks?

1125
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:21,736
He has!

1126
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:24,197
He has?

1127
01:27:28,034 --> 01:27:30,161
-Hey! Lee Jung-do!
-No, don't do it.

1128
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,121
-No, don't!
-Let go.

1129
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:33,164
-Don't do it.
-Stop.

1130
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:34,582
-Don't.
-Hey!

1131
01:27:39,003 --> 01:27:40,630
This is 112. How can I help you?

1132
01:27:40,713 --> 01:27:43,549
There's a man making child pornography.
Please come now.

1133
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:44,759
Where are you now?

1134
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:48,513
Kang used Kim's card
at the places marked with red circles

1135
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:50,807
in the past two weeks.

1136
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:52,892
Notice all these motels?

1137
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:55,436
I think it's highly likely
that he's in this area now.

1138
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,189
All right.
Moisture, did you bring your drone?

1139
01:27:58,273 --> 01:27:59,857
Yeah, it's in my car.

1140
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:03,653
All right, friends. Don't get hurt.

1141
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:06,447
And

1142
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,283
sorry for yelling.

1143
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:11,786
That's cool. It's all good.

1144
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:13,830
Honestly, I was quite shocked.

1145
01:28:15,748 --> 01:28:16,582
Winner winner…

1146
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:17,959
Chicken dinner!

1147
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:20,712
God, it's cold.

1148
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:26,801
-Where are you going?
-What?

1149
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:30,805
No. Don't do anything dangerous.

1150
01:28:32,473 --> 01:28:33,725
-Dad.
-Hey!

1151
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:36,019
You were stabbed.

1152
01:28:37,228 --> 01:28:39,397
Any deeper, and you could have died!

1153
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:47,989
-Guys. Go in for a minute.
-Okay.

1154
01:28:48,072 --> 01:28:49,240
Take your time.

1155
01:28:55,371 --> 01:28:56,539
Three months ago…

1156
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,877
I didn't even know what an ankle tag was.

1157
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:05,381
But I know everything now.

1158
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:07,133
In fact, I know too much.

1159
01:29:10,553 --> 01:29:12,263
I cannot forget what I've learned.

1160
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:13,931
It's the police's job.

1161
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:16,476
You don't need to get involved.

1162
01:29:18,978 --> 01:29:19,812
You know,

1163
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:23,274
that young girl I saved that day…

1164
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:28,613
is still too scared of people
to leave home.

1165
01:29:32,283 --> 01:29:33,159
She's ten.

1166
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:35,578
Only ten.

1167
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:42,460
But it hurt the young girl so much
that she shut herself off.

1168
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:46,172
You know what I found out today?

1169
01:29:48,966 --> 01:29:51,844
That the evil bastard hurt another child.

1170
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:58,142
The police? Yeah, I know.

1171
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:00,728
I'm sure they're all working hard.

1172
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:02,980
I want to do my best too.

1173
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,361
Without regrets.

1174
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:14,700
I also want to do my best
so I won't have regrets later.

1175
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:22,250
So please let me just go.

1176
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:26,045
If I go now, I can catch that bastard.

1177
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:31,217
As I speak, a ten-year-old girl
could be trembling with fear,

1178
01:30:32,301 --> 01:30:34,554
waiting for me to rescue her, Dad.

1179
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:38,766
I wouldn't care if I didn't know.

1180
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:42,520
But now I know. How can I do nothing?

1181
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:53,030
And I won't get hurt again,
so don't you worry.

1182
01:30:57,702 --> 01:30:59,412
I know I can do it this time, Dad.

1183
01:31:02,206 --> 01:31:03,207
So wish me luck.

1184
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:09,380
I'll see you later.

1185
01:31:12,091 --> 01:31:13,092
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1186
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:20,391
Be careful.

1187
01:31:21,767 --> 01:31:22,602
I will!

1188
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:12,652
Ready.

1189
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:16,864
VOICE CALL

1190
01:32:19,992 --> 01:32:20,868
Group calling now.

1191
01:32:21,619 --> 01:32:24,622
Tell me immediately if anything happens,
and do not step in.

1192
01:32:24,705 --> 01:32:25,706
Got it?

1193
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:27,124
Let's go.

1194
01:32:36,842 --> 01:32:39,470
-Earthworm, start here and go straight.
-Okay.

1195
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:44,767
Hello?

1196
01:32:45,643 --> 01:32:47,019
That way. I'll go this way.

1197
01:32:47,103 --> 01:32:48,271
-Okay, take care.
-Sure.

1198
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,110
-Hello.
-Hello.

1199
01:32:54,193 --> 01:32:57,280
Has this man been staying here?

1200
01:32:57,363 --> 01:32:59,031
No, I haven't seen him.

1201
01:32:59,115 --> 01:33:00,783
Have you seen this man?

1202
01:33:01,492 --> 01:33:02,493
I've never seen him.

1203
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,412
Have you seen this man?

1204
01:33:04,495 --> 01:33:05,830
No, I haven't.

1205
01:33:05,913 --> 01:33:07,373
Please take a closer look.

1206
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,541
I really don't know.

1207
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:09,875
Thank you.

1208
01:33:09,959 --> 01:33:11,043
He's not staying here.

1209
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:12,962
Sorry to bother you. Thank you.

1210
01:33:14,505 --> 01:33:17,216
Guys. I'm in front of Daewon Motel now.

1211
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,760
It's at the end of the alley
where we started.

1212
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:23,472
I see Chinese food containers.
There are a bunch of men's shoes inside.

1213
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:25,141
-Come check it out.
-Okay.

1214
01:33:28,519 --> 01:33:29,520
Over here.

1215
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:33,691
-Hey, look.
-Where?

1216
01:33:43,367 --> 01:33:46,454
Hey, did you forget
I saved your life in prison?

1217
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:48,539
Not this shit again.

1218
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:50,916
It's about time you let it go.

1219
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:53,002
Ki-jung.

1220
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:54,879
Let's open the window.

1221
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:02,094
I'll handle it from here.
Go wait in the car.

1222
01:34:02,803 --> 01:34:03,638
Be careful.

1223
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:05,723
-Call us anytime.
-See you.

1224
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:06,682
See you soon.

1225
01:34:14,523 --> 01:34:15,733
Okay.

1226
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:28,954
Get out here, Kang Ki-jung,
you son of a bitch!

1227
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:33,459
What's going on?

1228
01:34:34,293 --> 01:34:36,379
It's dangerous. Please go inside. Sorry.

1229
01:34:36,879 --> 01:34:37,713
Okay.

1230
01:34:42,468 --> 01:34:44,762
Who are you, motherfucker?

1231
01:34:46,597 --> 01:34:48,849
I'll crack your skull open,
you fucking prick.

1232
01:34:50,851 --> 01:34:53,270
Look at that son of a bitch.

1233
01:35:05,991 --> 01:35:08,285
-You fucking bastard.
-Fucking prick!

1234
01:35:09,495 --> 01:35:11,997
This is gochujang! It's burning my eyes!

1235
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:12,915
Fuck.

1236
01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:17,044
Do you have a death wish?

1237
01:35:27,346 --> 01:35:28,347
My hand!

1238
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:32,518
Hey, asshole. Come here!

1239
01:35:42,027 --> 01:35:44,155
Hey, you fucking piece of shit!

1240
01:35:50,494 --> 01:35:51,328
What?

1241
01:35:53,372 --> 01:35:54,206
What the hell?

1242
01:36:04,967 --> 01:36:05,801
Moisture!

1243
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:06,969
I'll follow him.

1244
01:36:14,059 --> 01:36:15,186
You son of a bitch!

1245
01:36:25,654 --> 01:36:27,656
Stop him! Don't let him go inside.

1246
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:38,000
Son of a…

1247
01:36:46,675 --> 01:36:47,593
It burns!

1248
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:02,983
You bastard!

1249
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:06,821
Fuck you, asshole.

1250
01:37:08,405 --> 01:37:09,573
Fuck off, you son of a--

1251
01:37:14,328 --> 01:37:15,746
Moisture, which way?

1252
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:16,831
Go right.

1253
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:22,419
Now left.

1254
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:25,297
Now turn right.

1255
01:37:31,554 --> 01:37:34,223
-He's looking at the drone.
-Maybe he knew all along.

1256
01:37:35,474 --> 01:37:36,392
Damn it.

1257
01:37:42,898 --> 01:37:43,941
You startled me.

1258
01:39:00,142 --> 01:39:01,352
You're dead.

1259
01:39:18,994 --> 01:39:20,037
Come at me.

1260
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:23,540
Come on out, you bastard.

1261
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:16,385
Hey, do something.

1262
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:33,902
-Nice!
-Oh yeah!

1263
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:26,598
You have the right to remain silent.

1264
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:29,059
Anything you say can

1265
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:32,563
and will be used against you
in a court of law.

1266
01:42:34,314 --> 01:42:35,899
SILENT, AGAINST YOU, ATTORNEY

1267
01:42:36,483 --> 01:42:38,569
And you have the right to an attorney.

1268
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:56,545
"I present this award to you…

Thank you.

1274
01:43:17,816 --> 01:43:19,234
You saved lives.

1275
01:43:20,110 --> 01:43:21,361
Thank you very much.

1276
01:43:22,613 --> 01:43:23,614
Thank you.

1277
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:28,118
The president will now take pictures
with the award recipients.

1278
01:43:46,803 --> 01:43:47,679
One moment, please.

1279
01:43:49,598 --> 01:43:50,432

1280
01:43:52,017 --> 01:43:52,851

Thank you.

1282
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:57,606
Are you all right?

1283
01:43:57,689 --> 01:43:59,942
Yes, I'm okay now.

1284
01:44:00,859 --> 01:44:02,236
I'm glad to hear that.

1285
01:44:03,403 --> 01:44:04,279
Thank you.

1286
01:44:13,163 --> 01:44:14,248
