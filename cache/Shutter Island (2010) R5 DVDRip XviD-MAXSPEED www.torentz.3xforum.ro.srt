00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,410
Pull yourself together Teddy!

3
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:11,969
Pull yourself together!

4
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:18,499
It's just water.

5
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:22,224
It's a lot of water.

6
00:01:28,449 --> 00:01:29,199
Come on.

7
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:56,479
- You okay boss?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I just... I just can't

8
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:00,019
I just can't stomach the water.

9
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:05,574
- So you're my new partner?
- That's right.

10
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:08,968
Not the best way to meet with my head
halfway down the toilet.

11
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:12,603
Doesn't exactly square with Teddy Daniels:
The man. The legend. I'll give you that.

12
00:02:12,604 --> 00:02:13,579
The Legend?

13
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,728
What the hell are you boys smoking
out there in Portland anyway?

14
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:17,354
Seattle.

15
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:21,324
I came from the office in Seattle.

16
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:24,528
How long have you been with Marshals?

17
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:25,504
Four years.

18
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:30,274
- So you know how small it is?
- Sure

19
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:35,549
What about you? You got a girl? Married?

20
00:02:36,249 --> 00:02:36,849
I was.

21
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:49,554
She died.

22
00:02:50,529 --> 00:02:54,279
- Jesus... I didn't...
- Don't worry about it.

23
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:58,248
There was a fire in our apartment
building while I was at work

24
00:02:58,249 --> 00:02:59,724
Four people died.

25
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:03,248
It was the smoke that got her
not the fire. So...

26
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,568
- So that's important.
- I'm sorry, Boss.

27
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:07,969
Where are my goddamn cigarettes?

28
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:10,848
Well here. Have one of mine.

29
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:14,168
I could of sworn they were in my jacket
when I got on.

30
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:17,094
Government employees will rob you blind.

31
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:19,599
Thanks.

32
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,688
They give you a briefing
about the institution before you left?

33
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:26,889
All I know is it's a mental hospital.

34
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:29,729
For the criminally insane.

35
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:32,448
Well, if it was just folks running around,
hearing voices,

36
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:37,124
and chasing after butterflies,
they wouldn't need us.

37
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:47,728
- That's where we're headed?
- Yup.

38
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:50,168
The other side of the island is rock bluffs

39
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:52,044
all the way down to the edge
of the water.

40
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:56,124
The dock, it's the
only way on...or off.

41
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:59,848
We will be casting off as soon as
you two are ashore.

42
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:02,328
I'd appreciate if you'd hurry up about it.

43
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:04,454
- Why?
- Storm's coming.

44
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:33,819
I've never seen a marshal's
badge before.

45
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:36,448
I'm Deputy Warden
McPherson, gentlemen.

46
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:41,899
Welcome to Shutter Island.
I'll be the one taking you up to Ashecliffe.

47
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:55,248
Your boys seem a little on edge
Mr. McPherson.

48
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:57,849
Right now, Marshal. We all are.

49
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:18,924
"Remember us for we too have
lived, loved and laughed"

50
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:41,449
Electrified perimeter.

51
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:44,624
How could you tell?

52
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:48,874
I've seen something like it before.

53
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:18,968
All right. You gentlemen will be accorded
all the help we can give.

54
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:23,528
But during the stay you will
obey protocol. Is that understood?

55
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:24,454
Absolutely.

56
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:28,648
The red brick bulding on my right
is ward A, the male ward.

57
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:31,528
Ward B, the female ward, is the one
on the left.

58
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:34,755
Ward C is that building on the bluffs.
An old civil war fort.

59
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,849
The most dangerous patients
are housed there.

60
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,969
Admittance to ward C is forbidden without
the written consent and

61
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,729
physical presence of both myself and Dr. Cawly.

62
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,355
Is that understood?

63
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,355
You act like insanity is catching.

64
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:58,000
You are hereby required to surrending
your firearms.

65
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,569
Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed
federal marshals.

66
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,969
We are required to carry our
firearms with us at all times.

67
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,889
Executive order 319 of the Federal Code of
Penitentiaries states that:

68
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,969
when inside the penitentiary

69
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,745
the offices of that institution
have final authority.

70
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:21,645
Gentlemen, you will not get through
this gate with your firearms.

71
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,649
Okay. Now that the official stuff is done,
come on boys.

72
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,000
What do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?

73
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,849
So when did she escape? This prisoner?

74
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,849
I'm afraid that Dr. Cawley will have to
fill you in on the situation.

75
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,625
Protocol.

76
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,129
Correctional officers at a mental institution.

77
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,438
That's a weird sight,
if you don't mind me saying

78
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,569
It's the only facility of it's kind in the U.S.
Even in the world.

79
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,169
We take only the
most dangerous, damaged patients.

80
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,969
Ones no other hospital can manage.
And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.

81
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:20,770
He's created something really unique here.
A hospital for people our society normally...

82
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,650
ID's, gentlemen.

83
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,950
Show your badges, gentlemen.

84
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,449
Dr. Cawley's been consulted
numerous times

85
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,850
- By Scotland Yard, MI5, the OSS...
- Why?

86
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,055
What do you mean?

87
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,849
What do the intelligence agencies want
to consult a psychatrist about?

88
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,550
I guess you'll have to ask him.

89
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,649
- Marshal Daniels.
- Doctor.

90
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,850
Marshal Aule.

91
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,729
- Thank you deputy warden, that will be all.
- Yes, sir.

92
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,380
Pleasure, gentlemen.

93
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,169
He had a lot to say about you.

94
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,169
McPherson is a good man.
He believes in the work we do here.

95
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,529
And what would that be exactly?

96
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,969
A moral fusion between law and
order and clinical care.

97
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,920
Pardon me Doc...
a what between what and what?

98
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,375
Those paintings are quite accurate.

99
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,249
It used to be that the kind of patients we
deal with here

100
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,849
were shackled and left in their own filth.

101
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,950
They were beaten. As if whipping
them bloody would drive the psychosis out.

102
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:08,569
We drove screws into their brains. We submerged
them in icy water until they lost consciousness.

103
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,820
Or even drown.

104
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,449
- And now?
- We treat them.

105
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,550
Try to heal, try to cure.

106
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,329
And if this fails, at least we provide them
with a measure of comfort in their lives. Calm.

107
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,380
These are...

108
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,529
all violent offenders, right?

109
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,280
They've hurt people.

110
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,449
- Murdered them in some cases.
- In almost all cases. Yes.

111
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:34,969
Then personally Doctor, I'd have to
say... screw their sense of calm.

112
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,729
It's my job to treat my patients not
their victims. I'm not here to judge.

113
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,030
- So this female prisoner...
- Patient.

114
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,520
Excuse me, patient.
One Rachel Solando,

115
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,249
- Escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.
- Last night.

116
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,225
Between 10 and midnight.

117
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,449
- Is she considered dangerous?
- You could say that.

118
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,849
She killed all three of her children.

119
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,849
She drowned them in the lake behind her house.

120
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,129
She took them out one by one and held their
heads under until they died.

121
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,569
Then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table.

122
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,445
She ate a meal there
before a neighbor dropped by.

123
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,249
And what about the husband?

124
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,649
He died. On the beaches of Normandy.
She is a war widow.

125
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:23,600
She starved herself when first she came here.
She insisted the children weren't dead.

126
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,369
- Sorry doctor. You wouldn't happen to have an aspirin? Do you?
- Prone to headaches marshal.

127
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,169
Sometimes, but today...

128
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,249
- I'm a little more prone to seasickness.
- Ah, Dehydration...

129
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,849
- You alright boss?
- Yes.

130
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,849
In that case you're quite right.
The simpler the better.

131
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,375
Thank you so much.

132
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,580
Rachel still believes
her children are alive.

133
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:54,975
She also believes this place is her home
in the Berckshires.

134
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,249
You're kidding me.

135
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,289
She's never once in two years acknowledged
that she is in an institution.

136
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,649
She believes we're all...

137
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,049
deliveryman, milkman, postal workers.

138
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,489
To sustain the illusion that her children never died,
she's created an elaborate fictional structure.

139
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,490
She gives us all parts to play in that fiction.

140
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,889
- So have you searched the grounds yet?
- The warden and his men scoured the island,

141
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,990
not a trace.

142
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:22,449
What's more disturbing is, we don't know
how she got out of her room.

143
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,729
It was locked from the outside

144
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,330
and the only window is barred.

145
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,650
It's as if she evaporated straight
through the walls.

146
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,649
Brought her right back here after
group therapy, locked her in

147
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,875
I came back for a midnight round
and she was gone.

148
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:55,049
Seriously doctor, how is it possible
that the truth never gets through to her?

149
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,969
I mean, she's in a
mental institution, right?

150
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,969
Seems like something you'd
notice from time to time.

151
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,449
- How many pairs of shoes are the patients given?
- Two pairs.

152
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,584
Sanity is not a choice, marshal,

153
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,249
You can't just choose to get over it.

154
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,725
So... she left here barefoot?

155
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,088
Come on Doc, she couldn't get ten
yards in that terrain.

156
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:16,864
Marshal?

157
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:37,448
Well this is definitely Rachel's
handwriting.

158
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:41,888
- I have no idea what the "law of 4" is, though.
- It's not a psychiatric term?

159
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,088
I'm afraid not.

160
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:43,964
Who's 67?

161
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:46,848
Fuck if I know!

162
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:50,048
I'd have to say that's quite
close to my clinical conclusion.

163
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:52,448
So you think it's
random scribblings?

164
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:56,248
Oh no, not at all. Rachel is smart.
Brilliant in fact.

165
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:59,248
- This paper could be important.
- Excuse me Doctor, but...

166
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:02,774
- We're gonna have to hold onto this.
- Of course.

167
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:06,448
And you say she had to come through here.

168
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:10,328
After lights out, the orderlies play
cards in here.

169
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:15,328
Last night there were 7 men sitting
at the base of those stairs playing stud poker.

170
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:18,968
Yet somehow, Rachel managed
to slip past them.

171
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:19,369
Why?

172
00:14:20,849 --> 00:14:22,974
How? She turns invisible?

173
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,528
Doctor, we're gonna need access to personnel files
of all the medical staff.

174
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:28,368
The nurses, the guards, the orderlies.

175
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:31,728
- Anyone who was working then.
- We'll take your request under consideration.

176
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:34,329
This is not a request, Doctor.

177
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:37,088
This is a federal facility
and a dangerous prisoner...

178
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:39,039
- Patient.
- Patient...

179
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:43,648
- has escaped now. You will comply...
- All I can say is that I will see what I can do.

180
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:48,848
Doctor, we're gonna need to speak with the staff,
do you understand?

181
00:14:48,849 --> 00:14:51,968
I'll assemble them in the
common room after dinner.

182
00:14:51,969 --> 00:14:59,119
If you have any further questions feel
free to join the deputy warden in the search.

183
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:11,568
It's 11 miles to the nearest land
and the water is freezing.

184
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:14,648
The current was strong last night.
The tide pushing in.

185
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:22,048
She'd have drowned or been crushed on the
rocks, and her body would have washed back up onshore.

186
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:25,168
What about those caves down there,
have you checked them?

187
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:27,544
No way she could get there.

188
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:31,648
The base of those cliffs are covered
in poison ivy, live oak, sumac

189
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:35,048
and a thousand plants with thorns
as big as my dick.

190
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:39,349
You said it yourself marshal,
she's got no shoes.

191
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:47,044
All right!
Let's check the other side!

192
00:15:50,729 --> 00:15:54,279
- What's that tower?
- It's an old lighthouse.

193
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:57,724
The guards already searched inside it.

194
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:03,328
- What's in there? More patients?
- Sewage treatment facility.

195
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,204
It's getting dark soon.

196
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:07,328
I'm calling this off for the night.

197
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:08,704
Let's go, boys!

198
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:14,968
- You were on watch on the landing, huh?
- Yeah.

199
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:19,648
Can't nobody get in or out of their room
in that corridor without me seeing.

200
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:21,448
Okay, Rachel Solando,

201
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:25,649
who else does she have to pass
to get down here?

202
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:30,374
Me.

203
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:32,549
Glen Miga.

204
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:37,728
- Sir, I didn't see nothing.
- And you were at your post all night?

205
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,754
Yes. But I didn't see a thing.

206
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:41,924
Glen.

207
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:45,004
Glen.

208
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:50,049
Tell me the truth.

209
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:56,848
I maybe... went to the bathroom.

210
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:02,328
- What? You breached protocol? Christ...
- I wasn't gone more than a minute.

211
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:05,048
All right, let's back up here.
Let's all just back up.

212
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:08,448
Miss Solando was put in
her room for lights out.

213
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:11,448
Does anybody here know what she did
before that?

214
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:12,074
Anyone?

215
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:16,399
Come on. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone.

216
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,919
She was in a group therapy session.

217
00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:22,924
Huh. Did anything unusual occur?

218
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:24,549
Define "unusual".

219
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:28,448
- Excuse me.
- It's a mental institution, marshal.

220
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:30,299
For criminally insane.

221
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,724
"Usual", isn't a big part of our day.

222
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:35,649
I will rephrase.

223
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:39,848
Did anything happen last night
during group therapy, that was more...

224
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:42,848
- let's say, more memorable than...
- Normal?

225
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:43,549
Exactly!

226
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:45,669
No. I'm sorry.

227
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:50,728
Did Mrs. Solando say anything
during group therapy?

228
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:53,404
She was worried about the rain.

229
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:55,848
And she hated the food here.

230
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:59,449
Complained constantly.
Last night included.

231
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:03,648
So... you were there.
Was there a doctor present?

232
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,774
Yes. Dr. Sheehan led the discussion.

233
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:08,299
Dr. Sheehan?

234
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:12,399
Yes. He was running the session.

235
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:14,848
He's Rachels's "primary".

236
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:18,999
The psychaiatrist who directly
oversees her care.

237
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:21,968
We're gonna need to speak with Dr. Sheehan.

238
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:24,448
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

239
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:27,688
He left on the ferry this morning.
His vacation was already planned.

240
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,528
He'd putting it off too long.

241
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:31,848
You're in a state of lockdown.

242
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:34,368
A dangerous patient has escaped

243
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:38,619
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation?

244
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:40,799
Of course, he's a doctor.

245
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:48,648
Do you have the phone number for
where he's gone?

246
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:49,774
Hello? Hello?

247
00:18:52,449 --> 00:18:52,999
Hello?

248
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:55,569
Is anybody there?

249
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:58,848
I'm sorry sir, but its all down.
All the lines.

250
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:00,448
The storm's hitting the
mainland like a hammer.

251
00:19:00,449 --> 00:19:05,049
If you get it working, come find me immediately.
The marshalls need to make an important call.

252
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:05,875
Yes, sir.

253
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,129
I'm afraid I have evening rounds in the wards,

254
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,004
But I'll be having drinks and a cigar at
my house around 9

255
00:19:18,005 --> 00:19:19,849
If you'd care to drop by

256
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,450
Good, we can talk then, right?

257
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,875
We have been talking, marshal.

258
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,489
Gotta say, I'm thinking I got
into the wrong line of public service.

259
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,449
It is a little overwhelming.
it was constructed during the civil war

260
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,750
The same time as the military fort
housing ward C.

261
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,849
This is the original commander's quarters
and Uncle Sam got the bill.

262
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,489
The commander was court-martialed.

263
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,715
I can see why.

264
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,325
Nice music. Who is that? Brahms?

265
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,175
No.

266
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,070
It's Mahler.

267
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,700
Quite right, marshal.

268
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:28,150
Forgive me, gentlemen...
My colleague, Dr. Jeremiah Naehring.

269
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,850
"Quartet for Piano and Strings
in A minor"

270
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,969
- Your poison, gentlemen?
- Rye, if you've got it.

271
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,295
Soda and ice please, thanks.

272
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,849
You don't indulge in alcohol?

273
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,175
I am surprised.

274
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,969
Isn't it common for men in your
profession to imbibe?

275
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,170
Common enough.
And yours?

276
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:03,569
- I'm sorry?
- Your profession, doctor. Psychiatry...

277
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,249
I've always heard it was overrun
with boozers and drunks.

278
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,200
Not that I've noticed.

279
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,650
What's that? Iced tea in your glass there?

280
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:15,225
Excellent marshal.

281
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,329
You have outstanding defense mechanisms.

282
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,805
You must be quite adept at interrogations, hmm?

283
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,875
Men like you... are my specialty.
You know?

284
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,250
Men of violence.

285
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,529
That's a hell of an assumption to make...

286
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:43,529
No assumption. Not at all. You misunderstand
me, I said you are men of violence

287
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:47,729
I'm not accusing you of being violent men.
That's quite different.

288
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,280
Please, please, edify us, doctor.

289
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,780
You both served overseas.

290
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,649
Not much of a stretch, Doc. For all you know,
we were both paper pushers over there

291
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,175
No, you were not.

292
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:22,249
Since the schoolyard, neither of
you has ever walked away from a physical conflict.

293
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:27,449
Not because you enjoy it, but because retreat
wasn't something you considered an option.

294
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,600
We weren't raised to run, Doc.

295
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,725
Ah, yes... Raised.

296
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,649
and who raised you, marshal?

297
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:36,975
Me?

298
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:39,875
Wolves.

299
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,770
Very impressive defense mechanisms.

300
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,000
Do you believe in God, marshal?

301
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,375
I'm quite serious.

302
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,055
That's rubbish.

303
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,925
Have you ever seen... a death camp, doctor?

304
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:07,070
[In German]
I have, I was there, for
the liberation of Dakau.

305
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,000
Your English is very good, almost flawless.

306
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:20,969
His English is very good.
You hit the consonants a tad hard, though.

307
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,220
You're German?

308
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:30,600
- Is legal immigration a crime, marshal?
- Oh I don't know doctor, you to tell us.

309
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:35,529
Now listen, we're gonne need those files on Sheehan
and the rest of staff as well.

310
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,369
No personnel files will be released for you.
Period.

311
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:41,489
- We're gonna need those files.
- Out of the question.

312
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,369
Bullshit, out of the question!
Bullshit!

313
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,849
Who the hell is in charge here anyway, huh?

314
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,649
Dr. Naehring acts as liaison to
our board of overseers.

315
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,729
He relayed your request and it's been refused.

316
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,969
Refused? They don't have the authority
to refuse. And neither do you, sir.

317
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,569
Marshal, continue your investigation
and we will do all we can to help.

318
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,449
This investigation is over.

319
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,829
We're gonna file our reports
and hand it over to...

320
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,549
- Hoover's boys.
- Hoover's boys, that's right.

321
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,549
We'll be taking the ferry back in the morning.

322
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,800
Come on, Chuck.

323
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,325
Nice night.

324
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:28,950
You'll be bunking in the orderlies quarter.

325
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,120
Hey boss?... We really packing it in?

326
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:44,430
Why?

327
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:50,349
I guess, I dunno, I just...
never really quit anything before.

328
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,828
We haven't heard the truth once yet, Chuck.

329
00:25:53,829 --> 00:25:59,628
Listen. Rachel Solando did not slip out of
a locked cell barefoot without any help.

330
00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:01,628
I think she had alot of help.

331
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:04,148
Maybe Cawley's sitting up in his mansion
right now,

332
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:06,649
rethinking his whole attitude.

333
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:11,468
- Maybe in the morning...
- You're bluffing?

334
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,194
I didn't say that.

335
00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:34,228
I found a whole stack of these, Teddy.

336
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:37,028
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?

337
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:40,104
I killed alot of people in the war.

338
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:43,619
Is that why you drink?

339
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,404
Are you real?

340
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:48,874
No.

341
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:55,354
She's still here.

342
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:56,349
Who?

343
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:58,774
Rachel?

344
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:02,474
She never left.

345
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:19,849
Remember when we stayed in the cabin
in the summer, Teddy?

346
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:21,399
We were so happy.

347
00:27:23,749 --> 00:27:24,774
She's here.

348
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:26,724
You can't leave.

349
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:41,149
I'm not gonna leave.

350
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:44,394
I love you so much.

351
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:52,249
- I'm just bones in a box, Teddy.
- No.

352
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:53,999
I am.

353
00:27:57,949 --> 00:27:59,749
You have to wake up.

354
00:28:01,069 --> 00:28:02,144
I won't go.

355
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:04,649
You're here.

356
00:28:06,949 --> 00:28:07,749
I'm not.

357
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,179
You have to face that.

358
00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:14,699
But she is.

359
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:18,219
And so is he.

360
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:21,149
Who?

361
00:28:23,949 --> 00:28:24,649
Laeddis.

362
00:28:29,949 --> 00:28:31,174
I have to go.

363
00:28:34,869 --> 00:28:36,544
No! Please...just let me hold you.

364
00:28:37,229 --> 00:28:39,668
- Just a little bit longer.
- Oh, Teddy...

365
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:40,619
You have to let me go.

366
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:43,899
I can't.

367
00:29:15,229 --> 00:29:18,429
Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit.

368
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:22,094
Doctor.

369
00:29:23,149 --> 00:29:24,424
Doctor, doctor.

370
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:28,228
We need to interview the patients who
were in Rachel's group therapy session.

371
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:30,028
I thought your investigation was finished?

372
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:32,948
It's not like we can take the ferry.

373
00:29:32,949 --> 00:29:37,348
Now was Rachel receiving any
other treatment for her illnesses?

374
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:40,668
Do you know the state of the
mental health field these days, gentlemen?

375
00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:42,694
No. Not a clue doctor.

376
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:43,349
War.

377
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:47,028
The old school believes in
surgical intervention.

378
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:52,054
Psychosurgery.
Procedures like the trans-orbital lobotomy.

379
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:58,028
Some say the patients become reasonable, docile.
Others say they become zombies.

380
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,348
- And the new school?
- Psycho pharmacology.

381
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:02,468
A new drug has just been approved.
Authority.

382
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:04,103
Which relaxes psychotic patients.

383
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:05,548
You could say it tames them.

384
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:08,148
- And which school are you in, Doc?
- Me?

385
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:11,388
I have this radical idea that if you treat a
patient with respect,

386
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:12,914
listen to him,

387
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:17,399
try and understand.
you just might reach him.

388
00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:23,948
- These patients?
- Even these.

389
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:26,468
What should be a last resort is
becoming a first response.

390
00:30:26,469 --> 00:30:30,148
Give them a pill, put them in a corner,
and it all goes away.

391
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:32,668
Rachel Solando was on a combination of drugs

392
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:37,348
meant to keep her from becoming violent,
but it was only intermittently effective.

393
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:42,148
The greatest obstacle to her recovery was
her refusal to face what she had done.

394
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:42,699
"Was."

395
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:50,499
Is there a reason you keep referring to
your patient in the past tense, doctor?

396
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,974
Look outside, marshal.

397
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:55,374
Why do you think?

398
00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:04,888
Next up is Peter Breen. Assaulted
his father's nurse with a broken glass.

399
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:08,448
Nurse survived, but
her face permaanently disfigured.

400
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,674
I can't wait.

401
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:13,044
She'd smiles at me.
She was so sweet.

402
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:17,848
But... I could see it in her eyes.
She liked to be naked.

403
00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:19,449
To suck cock.

404
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:22,319
Okay, Mr. Breen.

405
00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:26,168
And then she asked me if she can have
a glass of water?

406
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:29,728
Alone in the kitchen?
Like that's no big deal?

407
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:32,969
- Why was that a big deal?
- It was obvious.

408
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:38,220
She wanted me to pull out my thing so she
could laugh at it.

409
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,555
Mr. Breen,

410
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:45,420
we need to ask you some questions, okay?

411
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,025
When I cut her she screamed

412
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,080
But...

413
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,500
She scared me.

414
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,800
What did she expect?

415
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,250
Interesting.

416
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,849
But we are here to talk
Rachel Solando, okay?

417
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,275
Rachel Solando...

418
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:06,129
Did you know she had drowned her own kids?

419
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,880
She drowned her kids!

420
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,449
This is a sick fucking world
we live in. I'll tell you that...

421
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,969
You know what? They should be gassed.

422
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,945
All of them... the retards, the killers

423
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:20,475
the niggers. You kill your own kid?
Gas the bitch!

424
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,475
Would you... stop that?

425
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,649
- A nurse?
- Please. Stop that.

426
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,600
A nurse maybe. Maybe she had kids, huh?

427
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,020
A husband...

428
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,145
Just trying to make ends meet,

429
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,550
to lead a normal life...

430
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,450
And it says in your file that uh...

431
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,895
You tore her face off, didn't you?

432
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:54,350
Congratulations, no more normal
for her, not ever again, no.

433
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,245
Do you know what she was afraid of?

434
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:00,650
You.

435
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,650
Could you stop that, please?!

436
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,030
Stop that!

437
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,800
Please... stop!

438
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,200
You know a patient by the name of Andrew Laeddis?

439
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,100
- I want to go back.
- Take him!

440
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,529
I'll never get out of here.

441
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,455
I'm not sure that I should.

442
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,529
Excuse me for saying this,

443
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,530
- Miss Kearns...
- Misses.

444
00:33:41,565 --> 00:33:42,580
Mrs. Kearns.

445
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,775
But you seem...

446
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,800
quite normal,...

447
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,529
I mean in comparison
with the other patients here.

448
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:54,830
Well, I have my dark days
I suppose everybody does.

449
00:33:55,170 --> 00:34:00,569
The difference is that most people don't kill
their husbands with an axe.

450
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:04,129
Although personally I think if a
man beats you and fucks

451
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:08,330
half the women he sees
and no one will help you,

452
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:13,569
axing him isn't the least understandable
thing you can do.

453
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,020
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

454
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,729
And what would I do if I did?

455
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:22,169
I don't know the world anymore.
They say there are

456
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,249
bombs that can reduce whole
cities to ash

457
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,249
And what do they call "televisions"...

458
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,200
voices and faces coming from a box.

459
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,930
I hear enough voices already

460
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:37,400
What can you tell us about Rachel?

461
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,475
Um. Not much, she... she keeps to herself.

462
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,600
She believed her kids were alive.

463
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:52,049
She thought she was still living
in the Berkshire and we were all neighbours

464
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,800
- The milkman, postmen...
- Deliveryman,

465
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,529
And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?

466
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:58,930
Yes. Um.

467
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,470
He talked about anger.

468
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:06,400
Tell me about him...

469
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,345
What's he like?

470
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,070
I think he's uh...

471
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:14,870
Okay... nice.

472
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:20,970
Not hard on the eyes
as my mother would say.

473
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:24,255
Did he ever make a pass at you?

474
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:24,775
No.

475
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:30,675
No, Dr. Sheehan is a good
doctor, he would never...

476
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,649
Could I have a glass of water, please?

477
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,625
No problem.

478
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,950
Thank you, marshal.

479
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:00,125
I have just one more question for you
Mrs. Kearns.

480
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:07,380
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

481
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:08,975
No.

482
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,725
Never heard of him.

483
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:19,895
She was coached.

484
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,289
She used practically the same words as
Cawley and the nurse.

485
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:29,640
- It's like she'd been told exactly what to say.
- Who is Andrew Laeddis?

486
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:35,525
You asked every one of those patients
back there about him. Who is he?

487
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:41,849
What the hell, boss, I'm your partner
for the Christ sake!

488
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,525
We just met, Chuck.

489
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,049
Been on the beat a long time.

490
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:49,649
You got a duty, got a career
and what I'm doing,

491
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,750
not exactly by the book.

492
00:36:53,130 --> 00:37:00,680
I don't give a damn about "by the book", boss
I just to know what the hell is going on.

493
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:05,675
When this case came over the wires,

494
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:10,930
- I requested it specifically. Do you understand?
- Why?

495
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,605
Andrew Laeddis,

496
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:20,449
was the maintenance man in the apartment
building where my wife and I lived.

497
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:20,925
Okay.

498
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,200
He was also a firebug.

499
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:30,325
Andrew Laeddis lit the match,

500
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,495
that caused the fire that killed my wife.

501
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,355
Let 'em out!

502
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,649
What happened to Laeddis?

503
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,350
Got away with it.
Laeddis got away with it and disappeared.

504
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,169
About a year ago, I opened up the
newspaper and there he is.

505
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,249
He's an ugly looking son of a bitch.

506
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,769
He had a new scar from his right temple
down to his left lip.

507
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:04,049
Eyes different colors.
Not the type of face you forget.

508
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:07,129
He'd burned down a schoolhouse. Killed 2 people.

509
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,969
He said voices told him to do it.

510
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,569
First he was sent to prison
and then he was transferred here.

511
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,648
- Then what?
- Then, nothing.

512
00:38:13,649 --> 00:38:17,448
He vanished like he never existed.
No record whatsoever.

513
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:20,003
I'm sure he's not in ward B
that leaves ward C.

514
00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:21,168
Or he could be dead.

515
00:38:21,169 --> 00:38:26,319
So could Rachel Solando for that matter.
Lot of places to hide a body here.

516
00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:30,574
Only one place
no one really knows.

517
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:44,728
That patient, Bridget Kearne,
when she sent me for water,

518
00:38:44,729 --> 00:38:47,648
she said something to you back there, didn't she?

519
00:38:47,649 --> 00:38:47,974
No.

520
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:51,904
Come on boss!

521
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:56,624
She wrote it.

522
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:12,124
Boss!

523
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:16,888
We gotta get indoors. It's turning
into fucking Kansas out here...

524
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:19,189
- All right.
- Now. Let's go!

525
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:22,549
Watch out!

526
00:39:25,249 --> 00:39:25,799
Jesus!

527
00:39:28,249 --> 00:39:30,324
Come on! Let's go back!

528
00:39:47,169 --> 00:39:49,144
Jesus Christ!
Damn it!

529
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:03,719
- Are you okay boss?
- Yes. That's all right.

530
00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:11,968
So... if Laeddis is here...

531
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:14,619
What are you going to do boss?

532
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:18,824
I'm not here to kill Leaddis.

533
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:29,524
If it was my wife
I'd kill him twice.

534
00:40:39,049 --> 00:40:44,799
When we got through the gates of Dakau,
the SS guards surrendered.

535
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:56,624
The commandante tried to kill himself
before we got there...

536
00:40:58,249 --> 00:40:59,774
but he botched it.

537
00:41:00,969 --> 00:41:03,044
Took him an hour to die.

538
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:11,674
When I went outside,
I saw all the bodies on the ground.

539
00:41:15,449 --> 00:41:16,974
Too many to count.

540
00:41:42,849 --> 00:41:44,599
Too many to imagine.

541
00:41:47,249 --> 00:41:47,924
So yeah

542
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:56,049
The guards surrendered, we took
their guns, we lined them up...

543
00:42:36,969 --> 00:42:38,494
It wasn't warfare,

544
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,099
it was murder.

545
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:48,244
Yeah I've had enough of killing.

546
00:42:51,049 --> 00:42:53,174
That's not why I'm here.

547
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:55,999
So what is this all about?

548
00:42:58,049 --> 00:42:59,974
After Laeddis vanished,

549
00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:04,744
I started doing some checking
on Ashecliffe.

550
00:43:04,969 --> 00:43:09,848
A lot of people knew about this place, but no
one wants to talk...

551
00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:12,599
You know? It's like they're scared of something

552
00:43:13,569 --> 00:43:17,248
You know this place is funded by
a special grant

553
00:43:17,249 --> 00:43:20,328
from the House of
Unamerican Activities Committee.

554
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:26,248
HUAC. And how exactly are we fighting
the Commies from an island in Boston Harbor?

555
00:43:26,249 --> 00:43:29,374
By conducting experiments on the mind.

556
00:43:30,049 --> 00:43:31,528
At least that's my guess.

557
00:43:31,529 --> 00:43:33,448
And you think thats going on in here?

558
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:35,648
Like I said, no one would talk, right?

559
00:43:35,649 --> 00:43:38,368
Until I found someone
who used to be a patient here.

560
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:40,168
Guy's name is George Noyce.

561
00:43:40,169 --> 00:43:42,594
Nice college kid.
Socialist.

562
00:43:42,729 --> 00:43:46,248
He gets offered some money for some
psych study. Guess what they were testing?

563
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:49,448
- Drug tests.
- So he starts seeing dragons everywhere.

564
00:43:49,449 --> 00:43:53,248
Almost beats his proffesor to death
Ends up here in Ashecliffe.

565
00:43:53,249 --> 00:43:53,924
Ward C.

566
00:43:55,169 --> 00:43:58,448
They released him after 1 year, right?
What does he do?

567
00:43:58,449 --> 00:44:03,769
Two weeks on the mainland he walks into
a bar and stabs three men to death.

568
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,769
His lawyer pleads insanity,
but Noyce...

569
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,849
stands up in the courtroom and

570
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:10,649
he begs the judge,
for the electric chair.

571
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,449
Anywhere but not a
mental hospital.

572
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,975
Judge gives him life in the Dedham prison.

573
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:21,049
- And you found him?
- Yes, I found him.

574
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,125
He's a mess

575
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:26,849
But it is pretty clear from what he tells me,

576
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:29,729
they're experimenting on people here.

577
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:31,530
I don't know, boss.

578
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,729
- How do you believe a crazy guy?
- That's the beauty of it.

579
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:40,249
Crazy people are a perfect subject.
They talk, but nobody listens.

580
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,850
I stood in Dakau.

581
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:46,729
We saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other, right?

582
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:49,129
For Christ sake we fought a goddamn war

583
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,489
to stop them,
and now find out it may be happening here?

584
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,015
On our soil?
No.

585
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:58,129
So what are you really here to do, Teddy?

586
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,480
I'm gonna get the proof,

587
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:04,649
I'm gonna go back, and blow
the lid off this place.

588
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:05,525
That's it.

589
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:07,820
Wait a minute.

590
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:11,649
You started asking around about Ashecliffe.

591
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:16,729
Waiting for a chance to get out here
then suddenly they need a US marshal?

592
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:19,489
I got lucky. There was a patient escape,
it was the perfect excuse.

593
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:22,449
No, no, no boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.

594
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:26,969
The world doesn't work that way. They got an
electrified fence around a septic facility.

595
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:29,970
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

596
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:34,449
A chief of staff with ties to the OSS
Funding from HUAC?

597
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:38,449
Jesus Christ! Everything about this place
stinks of "government ops".

598
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,449
- What If they wanted you here?
- Bullshit.

599
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:42,249
- You were asking questions.
- Bullshit.

600
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:47,369
Bullshit? We came in for Rachel Solando? Where is
one shred of evidence that she even existed?

601
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,729
There's no way they could of known I'd be
assigned to this case. No way...

602
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:52,649
While you were looking into them,
they were looking into you.

603
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,204
All they need to do
is fake an escape to get you here.

604
00:45:55,205 --> 00:45:59,780
And now they have you.
They have us both, here, now.

605
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:03,820
Marshal, are you out here?

606
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,969
This is deputy warden McPherson.

607
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:07,820
Marshal!

608
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,329
How about that? They found us huh.

609
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:13,849
It's an island, boss. They're always gonna find us.

610
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:16,300
I know you are in there...

611
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:19,569
We're getting off of this Goddamned island.
You and me.

612
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:20,320
Come on!

613
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:25,805
- Come on!
- Go!

614
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:39,169
Get dried off.
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you. Now!

615
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:44,645
And hurry up, this thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane!

616
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:49,729
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.

617
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:51,649
It should be ready by tomorrow.

618
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:54,425
That is if we don't all wash away first.

619
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:59,049
Speaking of which, I'm afraid your smokes were
pretty much done for.

620
00:46:59,050 --> 00:46:59,525
So...

621
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:03,969
This is our only choice, huh?

622
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:07,049
Got something really nice in prison already
if that don't work for you...

623
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:10,625
Now that you mention it, these are just fine.

624
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:13,689
That's why I must repeat my insistence
that all ward C patients

625
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:15,849
be placed in manual restraints.

626
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:19,649
If the facility floods, they'll drown.
You know that.

627
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,689
- That would take a lot of flooding.
- We are on an island,

628
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:23,449
in the middle of the ocean,
during a hurricane.

629
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:25,889
A lot of flooding seems like a
distinct possibility.

630
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:28,489
It's a gamble, Steven.
say the power fails

631
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:29,649
There's a backup generator.

632
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:33,375
And if that goes? The cell doors
will open.

633
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,525
Where are they going to go?
Hmm?

634
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:39,049
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc.

635
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:43,649
You're quite right. They're far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us.

636
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:47,169
If they're manacled to the floor, they'll die.

637
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:48,570
That's 24 human beings.

638
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,049
You can't live with that, can you?

639
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:52,849
Frankly, if it were up to me,

640
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:56,249
I'd put all 42 in ward A and B in
manual restraints as well.

641
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,000
Excuse me
Excuse me

642
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,604
- Marshal.
- I'm sorry doctor, I just have one quick question.

643
00:48:01,605 --> 00:48:02,849
Yes, I will be with you in a moment.

644
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:05,649
We spoke this morning
about Rachel Solando's note

645
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,449
The law of 4, I loved that.

646
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:11,569
You said you had no idea what
that second line could refer to. Correct?

647
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:12,445
Who is 67?

648
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:17,449
Yes, I'm afraid I still don't.
None of us do.

649
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:19,350
Uh huh. Nothing comes to mind.

650
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:21,870
Nothing?

651
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,689
Because I believe I just heard
you say that there are

652
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:30,640
24 patients in ward C.

653
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:33,649
And 42 of patients, in wards A and B

654
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:38,049
Which means there is a total of what?
66 patients here in this facility.

655
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:39,800
That is correct, yes.

656
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:45,449
Then it seems that
Rachel Solando was suggesting

657
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:48,050
you have a 67th patient, doctor

658
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:53,129
- But I'm afraid we don't.
- This Is ridiculous.

659
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:56,649
- What are you doing here?
- We are doing our goddamn job.

660
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:59,969
Didn't McPherson tell you the good news?

661
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,329
No, what's the good news, doctor?

662
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:04,230
Rachel has been found.

663
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:06,080
She's here.

664
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:08,820
Safe and sound.

665
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:22,475
There is not a mark on her.

666
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,130
Who are these men?

667
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,049
Why are they in my house?

668
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,050
Police officers, Rachel.

669
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:36,925
They... have a few questions.

670
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:39,650
Ma'am.

671
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:47,169
There's been a sighting of a known
Communist

672
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:51,095
subversive in this area
passing out literature

673
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:52,445
Here?

674
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,025
In this neighborhood?

675
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,855
Yes, I'm afraid so.

676
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:03,649
If you can tell us what you did
yesterday, where you were,

677
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:06,450
it would really help us narrow our search.

678
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:07,520
Yes...

679
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:11,630
Well, I...umm

680
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:18,845
I made breakfast for Jim
and the children,

681
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,425
and then I...

682
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:25,650
I packed Jim's lunch
and he left.

683
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:31,545
Then I sent the children off to school.

684
00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:36,024
And then...

685
00:50:42,449 --> 00:50:46,149
I decided to take a long swim in the lake.

686
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:52,799
I see...

687
00:50:56,969 --> 00:50:58,294
And after that?

688
00:51:06,049 --> 00:51:07,174
After that...

689
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:17,974
I thought of you.

690
00:51:24,049 --> 00:51:25,528
I... I'm sorry, ma'am.

691
00:51:25,529 --> 00:51:28,754
I don't know what you're talking about.

692
00:51:30,849 --> 00:51:34,474
Don't you know how lonely I've been, Jim?

693
00:51:39,249 --> 00:51:40,499
You're gone...

694
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:45,469
You're dead.

695
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:53,049
I cry every night.

696
00:51:58,049 --> 00:52:00,574
How am I supposed to survive?

697
00:52:02,649 --> 00:52:03,049
God.

698
00:52:13,169 --> 00:52:15,844
Rachel... it will be all right.

699
00:52:19,249 --> 00:52:21,049
I'm so sorry, but...

700
00:52:22,569 --> 00:52:25,544
everything is gonna be all right? Okay?

701
00:52:27,249 --> 00:52:28,349
I buried you.

702
00:52:30,649 --> 00:52:35,448
I buried an empty casket. Your body
rained down lumps of flesh splashing

703
00:52:35,449 --> 00:52:36,849
into the sea eaten by sharks.

704
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:44,474
My Jim is dead,
So who the fuck are you?

705
00:52:46,649 --> 00:52:48,524
Who the fuck are you?!

706
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:51,394
Who are you?! Who are you?!

707
00:53:01,049 --> 00:53:02,768
I'm sorry about that.

708
00:53:02,769 --> 00:53:06,048
I didn't want to interrupt, I thought
she might tell you something, but...

709
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,088
we found her down by the lighthouse,

710
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:09,439
skipping stones.

711
00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:14,448
We have no idea how she got out there. I'm going
to ask you both to go down into basement.

712
00:53:14,449 --> 00:53:18,448
There's food, water, and cots.
It's the safest place to be

713
00:53:18,449 --> 00:53:20,499
when the hurricane hits.

714
00:53:23,969 --> 00:53:25,968
Are you all right?
You look pale.

715
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:27,969
I'm fine, it's just uh...

716
00:53:29,049 --> 00:53:30,724
Boss, are you okay?

717
00:53:31,729 --> 00:53:34,048
It's just so Goddamn bright? Isn't it?

718
00:53:34,049 --> 00:53:38,528
Photo sensitivity, headaches sometimes?
Marshal are you having a migraine?

719
00:53:38,529 --> 00:53:39,579
I'll be alright.

720
00:53:47,449 --> 00:53:50,888
- What's wrong with him.
- Take these, marshal. You'll sleep a couple
of hours, wake up clear as a bell.

721
00:53:50,889 --> 00:53:53,248
He's having a migraine.
Imagine someone sawed open your head and

722
00:53:53,249 --> 00:53:55,288
filled it with razors then shook it
as hard as they could.

723
00:53:55,289 --> 00:53:56,768
Take the pills, marshal.

724
00:53:56,769 --> 00:54:01,294
- No... I don't want the pills.
- It'll stop the pain. Take the pills.

725
00:54:04,969 --> 00:54:07,044
He's going to need to lie down.

726
00:54:28,049 --> 00:54:29,749
Careful. All right.

727
00:54:31,169 --> 00:54:32,994
Gonna be okay. Relax.

728
00:54:39,649 --> 00:54:41,474
- Who is that?
- Him?

729
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:44,049
That's the warden.

730
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:48,874
Don't you worry about him, alright?

731
00:54:54,329 --> 00:54:56,804
Looks like an ex-military prick.

732
00:54:57,649 --> 00:55:01,224
You know what? I ain't gonna argue
with you on that one.

733
00:56:21,969 --> 00:56:24,144
You should have saved me.

734
00:56:26,169 --> 00:56:28,970
You should have saved all of us.

735
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,100
Hey buddy. Hey.

736
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:02,030
Laeddis.

737
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:03,650
Yes.

738
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:16,750
Hi, buddy.

739
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:20,220
No hard feelings, right?

740
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:27,925
No hard feelings.

741
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:43,325
Little something for later.

742
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:49,150
Because I know how much you need it.

743
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:56,975
Clock's ticking, my friend.

744
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:59,745
We're running out of time.

745
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:10,530
Give me a hand here.

746
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,275
I could get into trouble.

747
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:01,725
I'm dead?

748
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:07,075
I'm so sorry.

749
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:10,600
Why didn't you save me?

750
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:15,049
I tried, I wanted to,
but by the time I got there,

751
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:16,500
it was too late.

752
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,850
See?

753
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:43,405
Aren't they beautiful?

754
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:38,030
Why are you all wet, baby?

755
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,925
Laeddis isn't dead.

756
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,550
He isn't gone.

757
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,500
He's still here.

758
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:51,325
I know.

759
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:53,969
We need to find him, Teddy.

760
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:56,695
You need to find him and
you kill him dead.

761
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,120
Shhh. It's okay.

762
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:26,800
Shh. Again!

763
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:28,950
The generator is faulty.

764
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:35,470
Are you okay boss?

765
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:39,520
This goddamn migraine!

766
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:43,825
Back up generators failed.
The whole place has gone crazy.

767
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:47,025
What do you want to do?

768
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:52,895
Christ!

769
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:55,855
No, no, no!
Put it down.

770
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:57,295
Now! Now!

771
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:10,504
You think the whole
electrical system is fried?

772
01:02:10,505 --> 01:02:13,469
I'd say that it's a good possibility.

773
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:15,389
All electronic security...

774
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:17,090
fences, gates, the doors

775
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:18,900
Come on.

776
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:21,589
Nice day for a stroll
don't you think?

777
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:24,540
To ward C for example.

778
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:29,300
Maybe we'll run into Andrew Leaddis.

779
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:36,229
The guy I told you about, George Noyce?

780
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:38,989
He told me this is where they keep
the worse ones.

781
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:42,640
The guys even the other inmates
are scared of.

782
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:45,704
Noyce give you anything on the layout?

783
01:02:45,705 --> 01:02:46,680
Not really.

784
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:50,703
All that he remembers was people
scream day and night. There were no windows.

785
01:02:50,704 --> 01:02:52,979
There were bars everywhere.

786
01:03:12,549 --> 01:03:13,749
Jesus Christ!

787
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:17,274
First time
on ward C, right?

788
01:03:17,704 --> 01:03:19,348
- Yes, yes...
- Yes.

789
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:23,388
- Yeah, heard stories, but...
- Trust me, sons. You haven't heard shit.

790
01:03:23,389 --> 01:03:25,788
We got most of the bugsies locked down now,

791
01:03:25,789 --> 01:03:27,748
But some of them are still loose.

792
01:03:27,749 --> 01:03:30,388
If you see one don't try
to restrain him yourselves.

793
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,028
These fuckers will kill you.

794
01:03:32,029 --> 01:03:32,579
Clear?

795
01:03:33,669 --> 01:03:36,894
Alright. Get your asses moving then.
Go on.

796
01:04:31,029 --> 01:04:31,979
He's here.

797
01:04:36,029 --> 01:04:36,729
Laeddis.

798
01:04:38,229 --> 01:04:39,604
I can feel him.

799
01:04:43,349 --> 01:04:44,799
Tag! You're it.

800
01:04:46,469 --> 01:04:46,869
Ted!

801
01:05:44,509 --> 01:05:45,684
Listen to me!

802
01:05:46,393 --> 01:05:48,317
Listen!
I do not want to leave, all right?

803
01:05:48,677 --> 01:05:52,481
Why would anyone want to?
We hear things here.

804
01:05:52,601 --> 01:05:55,083
About the outside world.
About atolls.

805
01:05:55,123 --> 01:05:57,606
About the h-bomb tests.

806
01:05:57,726 --> 01:06:00,609
You know how
a hydrogen bomb works?

807
01:06:00,649 --> 01:06:03,092
- With... Hydrogen?
- That's funny.

808
01:06:03,212 --> 01:06:05,694
- Boss!
- Other bombs explode, right?

809
01:06:06,415 --> 01:06:09,378
But not the hydrogen bomb
It implodes.

810
01:06:09,418 --> 01:06:13,702
Creating an explosion to the thousandth
millionth degree.

811
01:06:13,742 --> 01:06:15,504
- Do you get it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

812
01:06:15,544 --> 01:06:17,146
- Do you?
- I get it!

813
01:06:17,146 --> 01:06:19,028
Let em go!

814
01:06:32,842 --> 01:06:34,243
No!

815
01:06:35,844 --> 01:06:36,526
What are you doing?

816
01:06:36,846 --> 01:06:39,449
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!

817
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:41,651
You got Billings?

818
01:06:41,971 --> 01:06:44,734
What's the fucks the matter with you guys?
Catch them, not kill them!

819
01:06:44,774 --> 01:06:46,376
He jumped at us.

820
01:06:46,456 --> 01:06:49,779
You give me a hand with him.
We've got to get him to the infirmary.

821
01:06:49,779 --> 01:06:53,063
No! Not you, not you.
Take a walk.

822
01:06:53,103 --> 01:06:54,064
Come on!

823
01:06:54,144 --> 01:06:56,666
Paula's gonna have my Goddamn
balls for this..

824
01:07:26,096 --> 01:07:28,018
Laeddis....

825
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:51,920
Laeddis....

826
01:07:55,326 --> 01:07:58,850
You're dead, we're all dead.
This is hell, we're in hell.

827
01:08:01,212 --> 01:08:02,654
Please...

828
01:08:02,654 --> 01:08:04,055
...................

829
01:08:05,817 --> 01:08:06,818
Stop me.
Before I kill more.

830
01:08:13,945 --> 01:08:15,427
Go!

831
01:08:18,069 --> 01:08:19,551
Please, please!

832
01:08:28,758 --> 01:08:30,081
Laeddis ...

833
01:08:37,288 --> 01:08:40,571
You told me I'd be free of
this place.

834
01:08:41,771 --> 01:08:43,293
You promised.

835
01:08:44,295 --> 01:08:46,496
You lied.

836
01:08:46,977 --> 01:08:48,098
Laeddis?

837
01:08:52,463 --> 01:08:53,985
Laeddis!?

838
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,269
That's pretty damned funny.

839
01:08:58,591 --> 01:08:59,912
Your voice...

840
01:09:00,192 --> 01:09:01,794
Don't you recognize it?

841
01:09:01,795 --> 01:09:04,237
After all the talks we've had?

842
01:09:04,277 --> 01:09:06,720
After all the lies
that you've told me?

843
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,602
Let me see your face.

844
01:09:08,882 --> 01:09:11,124
They say I'm theirs now.

845
01:09:11,885 --> 01:09:14,608
They say I'll never leave here.

846
01:09:15,329 --> 01:09:17,891
Your match is about to go out.

847
01:09:19,813 --> 01:09:21,895
Let me see your goddamn face now!

848
01:09:21,935 --> 01:09:22,896
Why?

849
01:09:22,896 --> 01:09:25,259
So you can lie to me more?

850
01:09:25,299 --> 01:09:27,581
- This isn't about the truth!
- Yes it is.

851
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:31,225
- It's about exposing the truth.
- This is about you!

852
01:09:31,265 --> 01:09:32,706
And Laeddis.

853
01:09:33,908 --> 01:09:36,711
That's all it's ever been about.

854
01:09:36,751 --> 01:09:38,352
I was incidental.

855
01:09:39,433 --> 01:09:40,835
A way in.

856
01:09:43,437 --> 01:09:44,639
George?

857
01:09:45,159 --> 01:09:46,440
George Noyce?

858
01:09:47,241 --> 01:09:50,525
No, it's not possible,
You can't be here.

859
01:09:50,765 --> 01:09:52,046
Do you like it?

860
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:55,570
Who did this to you, George?

861
01:09:55,570 --> 01:09:56,851
You did!

862
01:09:57,332 --> 01:09:58,613
What the hell do you mean?

863
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:00,655
What are you talking
all of your fucking talk

864
01:10:00,695 --> 01:10:02,977
And I'm back here because of you!

865
01:10:03,017 --> 01:10:05,220
George, I how did they get you out of Dedham.
Huh?

866
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:08,463
However this happened, Im gonna
find a way to fix this. You understand me?

867
01:10:08,503 --> 01:10:09,824
I'll never get out now.

868
01:10:09,864 --> 01:10:12,467
I got out once, But not twice, never twice.

869
01:10:12,507 --> 01:10:15,670
- Tell me how they got you here?
- They knew!

870
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:17,072
Don't you get it?

871
01:10:17,392 --> 01:10:20,075
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

872
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,958
This is a game. All of this...

873
01:10:23,478 --> 01:10:24,760
is for you.

874
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,882
You're not investigating anything.

875
01:10:27,082 --> 01:10:30,485
You're a fucking rat
in a maze.

876
01:10:30,766 --> 01:10:31,767
George...

877
01:10:32,207 --> 01:10:34,209
you're wrong.

878
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:36,091
Really?

879
01:10:36,492 --> 01:10:39,975
Been alone much since
you got here?

880
01:10:40,095 --> 01:10:42,097
I'm been with my partner.

881
01:10:42,217 --> 01:10:45,100
You have never worked
with him before, have you?

882
01:10:45,901 --> 01:10:46,902
He's a...

883
01:10:47,503 --> 01:10:49,665
US Marshal from Seattle.

884
01:10:49,705 --> 01:10:52,628
You have never worked
with him before, have you?

885
01:10:53,909 --> 01:10:55,070
George, look...

886
01:10:55,111 --> 01:10:58,394
I know people.
I trust this man.

887
01:11:02,398 --> 01:11:04,840
Then, they've already won.

888
01:11:06,842 --> 01:11:11,447
Fuck!

889
01:11:12,008 --> 01:11:14,530
They're going to...

890
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,933
take me to the lighthouse.

891
01:11:17,013 --> 01:11:19,455
They're going to
cut into my brain.

892
01:11:20,136 --> 01:11:24,460
And I'm only here because of you!

893
01:11:25,261 --> 01:11:28,745
George, I'm going to get you out of here.
You're not going to the lighthouse.

894
01:11:29,666 --> 01:11:34,150
You can't dig out the truth and
kill Laeddis at the same time.

895
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:36,473
You've got to make a choice
you understand that, don't you?

896
01:11:36,473 --> 01:11:37,954
I'm not here to kill anyone.

897
01:11:38,034 --> 01:11:41,678
- Liar!
- I not gonna kill him! I swear to you ...

898
01:11:42,279 --> 01:11:44,281
She's dead.

899
01:11:44,681 --> 01:11:46,963
Let her go...

900
01:11:47,284 --> 01:11:48,365
Let her go.

901
01:11:49,486 --> 01:11:50,767
Tell him Teddy...

902
01:11:51,768 --> 01:11:53,971
Tell him why.

903
01:11:55,973 --> 01:11:57,975
You've got to do it.
There's no other way.

904
01:11:58,655 --> 01:12:02,780
- Let her go.
- Tell him about the day you brought me my locket...

905
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:03,781
You've gotta do it!

906
01:12:03,901 --> 01:12:07,184
How I told you my heart was breaking.
And you asked me why?

907
01:12:07,224 --> 01:12:08,946
She's fucking with your head.

908
01:12:08,986 --> 01:12:12,069
And then i told you
it was from happiness.

909
01:12:12,189 --> 01:12:13,591
She'll kill you. She's going to kill you.

910
01:12:16,794 --> 01:12:20,317
You want to uncover the truth?
You've gotta let her go ...

911
01:12:20,918 --> 01:12:23,881
- I can't.
- You have to let her go!

912
01:12:23,921 --> 01:12:25,723
I can't!
I can't.

913
01:12:31,729 --> 01:12:34,892
Then you'll never leave
this island.

914
01:12:40,098 --> 01:12:41,339
Dolores?

915
01:12:48,106 --> 01:12:50,508
He's not in this ward.

916
01:12:51,109 --> 01:12:52,911
He was transferred...

917
01:12:53,351 --> 01:12:54,632
Out of here.

918
01:12:56,434 --> 01:12:58,356
If he's not in ward A,

919
01:12:59,037 --> 01:13:01,840
there's only one place he can be

920
01:13:06,044 --> 01:13:07,846
The lighthouse.

921
01:13:15,053 --> 01:13:16,134
Hey!

922
01:13:18,977 --> 01:13:20,259
God help you.

923
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:31,350
Boss, we got problems.
McPherson and Cawley are in the building.

924
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:34,073
They heard an orderly went batshit on a patient,

925
01:13:34,113 --> 01:13:36,795
They're looking all over the place for him.
They're on the way to the roof.

926
01:13:36,876 --> 01:13:38,157
Let's get the hell out of here.

927
01:13:38,197 --> 01:13:39,158
This way.

928
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,083
Just keep going.
We belong here

929
01:13:53,092 --> 01:13:56,416
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

930
01:13:57,216 --> 01:13:58,858
Where were you?

931
01:13:58,898 --> 01:14:01,060
After we got that guy to the infirmary,

932
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:03,222
I took a little detour
to patient records.

933
01:14:03,303 --> 01:14:04,784
Did you ever find Laeddis?

934
01:14:05,785 --> 01:14:06,786
No.

935
01:14:06,906 --> 01:14:09,789
- No. I never found him.
- Well I've got the next best thing.

936
01:14:09,909 --> 01:14:11,271
His intake form.

937
01:14:11,311 --> 01:14:14,033
It was the only thing in his file.
No session notes. No incident reports.

938
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,915
No photographs... just this.
It was weird.

939
01:14:16,036 --> 01:14:17,717
Here, take a look.

940
01:14:18,518 --> 01:14:19,799
I'll look at it later.

941
01:14:21,721 --> 01:14:22,842
What's the matter, boss?

942
01:14:23,443 --> 01:14:25,725
I'll take a look at it later,
that's all.

943
01:14:28,008 --> 01:14:29,329
Ashecliffe's that way.

944
01:14:29,449 --> 01:14:31,211
I'm not going to Ashecliffe.

945
01:14:32,652 --> 01:14:34,134
I'm going to the lighthouse.

946
01:14:35,015 --> 01:14:37,658
I'm going to find out what
the fuck is happening on this island.

947
01:14:50,631 --> 01:14:51,752
Here it is.

948
01:14:52,353 --> 01:14:53,474
Damn!

949
01:14:54,555 --> 01:14:56,277
We're too far South.
We're gonna have to double back.

950
01:14:56,877 --> 01:14:59,280
There's no way we could cross those rocks.

951
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,083
There could be a way behind those trees.

952
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:03,844
Maybe a path that goes around the rocks
that leads over to the lighthouse.

953
01:15:03,964 --> 01:15:06,687
What are we doing here?
We've got the intake form.

954
01:15:07,168 --> 01:15:10,571
It proves there's a 67th patient...
which they've said repeatedly doesn't exist.

955
01:15:12,973 --> 01:15:14,975
I'm getting to that lighthouse.
Do you understand?

956
01:15:17,577 --> 01:15:20,100
What the hell can I say to you
to stop you?

957
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,501
Why would you want to Chuck?
Why?

958
01:15:21,581 --> 01:15:25,986
Because climbing down there
when it's dark is a thin step short
to suicide. That's why.

959
01:15:26,026 --> 01:15:26,987
Okay.

960
01:15:27,187 --> 01:15:30,390
Maybe you better sit this one out then.

961
01:15:31,912 --> 01:15:35,516
You brought me into this, boss.
And now I am trapped here on this rock.

962
01:15:35,516 --> 01:15:36,397
On this island.

963
01:15:36,517 --> 01:15:40,200
Without no one to rely on but eachother.
And now you're acting like.........

964
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,201
Like what? Like what?

965
01:15:41,281 --> 01:15:42,723
How am I acting?

966
01:15:46,527 --> 01:15:50,531
What the hell happened back there
in those cells, Ted?

967
01:15:55,416 --> 01:16:00,341
- What do you think the weather is like in Portland, Chuck?
- I'm from Seattle.

968
01:16:02,223 --> 01:16:03,624
Seattle?

969
01:16:08,029 --> 01:16:10,752
I'll going on...alone.

970
01:16:12,313 --> 01:16:13,835
I'm going with you, boss.

971
01:16:13,875 --> 01:16:15,436
I said alone.

972
01:16:17,158 --> 01:16:18,760
Fine.

973
01:16:43,345 --> 01:16:44,586
Damn it!

974
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:46,868
Damn it!

975
01:16:51,793 --> 01:16:54,756
I knew it wouldn't take long.
But I couldn't get to it. The tide was up.

976
01:17:03,966 --> 01:17:05,087
Chuck!

977
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:08,691
Chuck!

978
01:18:08,271 --> 01:18:09,272
Come on!

979
01:18:42,907 --> 01:18:44,108
Chuck!

980
01:18:44,589 --> 01:18:46,190
Where are you, Chuck?

981
01:19:09,934 --> 01:19:11,216
Chuck!

982
01:19:12,817 --> 01:19:14,219
Chuck!

983
01:19:56,942 --> 01:19:58,184
Who are you?

984
01:20:00,666 --> 01:20:01,947
I'm Teddy Daniels.

985
01:20:02,068 --> 01:20:03,069
I'm a cop.

986
01:20:04,270 --> 01:20:05,391
You're the marshal.

987
01:20:07,273 --> 01:20:08,394
That's right.

988
01:20:10,676 --> 01:20:11,677
Would you mind...

989
01:20:11,797 --> 01:20:14,480
taking your hand from behind
your back, please?

990
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:15,481
Why?

991
01:20:15,802 --> 01:20:17,283
Why?!

992
01:20:17,884 --> 01:20:20,687
I want to make sure what you're
holding won't hurt me.

993
01:20:27,814 --> 01:20:28,895
I'm gonna keep this...

994
01:20:30,296 --> 01:20:31,578
If you don't mind.

995
01:20:32,819 --> 01:20:34,581
Fine by me.

996
01:20:46,113 --> 01:20:47,234
You're Rachel Solando.

997
01:20:49,396 --> 01:20:50,717
The real one.

998
01:20:54,121 --> 01:20:55,842
Did you kill your children?

999
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:58,725
I never had children.

1000
01:21:00,447 --> 01:21:01,528
I was never married.

1001
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:06,854
And before I was a patient
in Ashecliff, I worked here.

1002
01:21:08,615 --> 01:21:09,937
You were a nurse?

1003
01:21:11,619 --> 01:21:13,220
I was a doctor, marshal.

1004
01:21:17,064 --> 01:21:18,225
You think I'm crazy?

1005
01:21:18,746 --> 01:21:21,348
- No, I ...
- And if I say I'm not crazy ...

1006
01:21:21,949 --> 01:21:24,632
well that hardly helps, does it?

1007
01:21:25,954 --> 01:21:29,157
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

1008
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,362
People tell the world you're crazy

1009
01:21:34,163 --> 01:21:35,444
and all your protests to the contrary,

1010
01:21:35,964 --> 01:21:37,086
just confirms what they're saying.

1011
01:21:40,169 --> 01:21:42,171
I'm not following you.
I'm sorry.

1012
01:21:42,651 --> 01:21:43,772
Once you are declared insane,

1013
01:21:44,653 --> 01:21:47,296
then anything you do is called
a part of an insanity.

1014
01:21:47,296 --> 01:21:49,899
Your reasonable protests
or denial.

1015
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:53,102
Valid fears,
paranoia.

1016
01:21:53,102 --> 01:21:55,184
Survival instincts.

1017
01:21:55,785 --> 01:21:56,786
Defense mechanisms.

1018
01:21:57,787 --> 01:22:00,069
You're smarter than you look marshal.
That's probably not a good thing.

1019
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:02,592
Tell me something...

1020
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:03,913
Yeah...

1021
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:07,396
What happened to you?

1022
01:22:08,197 --> 01:22:10,800
I started asking about these large
shipments of sodium-anatol.

1023
01:22:11,681 --> 01:22:14,604
- An opium-based hallucinogen.
- Psychotropic drugs.

1024
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:17,407
I asked about the surgeries, too.

1025
01:22:20,690 --> 01:22:22,292
Ever heard of trans-orbital lobotomy?

1026
01:22:24,214 --> 01:22:25,495
They zap the patient with electroshocks,

1027
01:22:26,616 --> 01:22:30,340
then go through the eye with an ice pick

1028
01:22:31,421 --> 01:22:33,023
and pull out some nerve fibers.

1029
01:22:36,026 --> 01:22:37,347
Makes the patients much more obedient.

1030
01:22:38,428 --> 01:22:40,150
Tractable.

1031
01:22:40,951 --> 01:22:41,952
It's barbaric.

1032
01:22:43,353 --> 01:22:44,434
Unconscionable.

1033
01:22:45,635 --> 01:22:50,040
Do you know how pain enters the
body marshal? Do you?

1034
01:22:50,961 --> 01:22:52,322
Depends on where you hurt.

1035
01:22:53,243 --> 01:22:54,525
No, it has nothing to do with the flesh.

1036
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:56,446
The brain controls pain.

1037
01:22:57,848 --> 01:23:01,452
The brain controls fear, empathy,
sleep, hunger, anger... everything.

1038
01:23:04,254 --> 01:23:05,135
What If you could control it?

1039
01:23:06,337 --> 01:23:07,338
The brain?

1040
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:08,979
Re-create a man,

1041
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,462
so he doesn't feel pain.

1042
01:23:12,062 --> 01:23:14,064
Or love. Or sympathy.

1043
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:19,750
A man who can't be interrogated
because he has no memories to confess.

1044
01:23:22,753 --> 01:23:24,275
You can never take away
all a man's memories.

1045
01:23:24,475 --> 01:23:25,756
Never.

1046
01:23:25,997 --> 01:23:29,280
Marshal, the North Koreans
used American POWs

1047
01:23:30,081 --> 01:23:32,483
during their brainwashing experiments.

1048
01:23:32,563 --> 01:23:35,006
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they are doing here.

1049
01:23:35,086 --> 01:23:39,490
They're creating ghosts to go out in the world.
And do things sane men never do.

1050
01:23:39,570 --> 01:23:42,278
To have that kind of ability, that kind of knowledge.

1051
01:23:42,861 --> 01:23:43,382
That would take years.

1052
01:23:44,576 --> 01:23:47,899
Years of research,
hundreds of patients to experiment on.

1053
01:23:49,901 --> 01:23:53,024
50 years from now,
people will look back

1054
01:23:53,024 --> 01:23:55,587
and say, "Here. This place
is where it all began."

1055
01:23:56,508 --> 01:23:58,590
The Nazis used the Jews.
The Soviets

1056
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:01,193
used prisoners in their own gulags
and we...

1057
01:24:01,913 --> 01:24:03,034
We tested patients,

1058
01:24:03,835 --> 01:24:04,916
on Shutter Island.

1059
01:24:06,198 --> 01:24:07,719
No, they won't ...
No

1060
01:24:12,404 --> 01:24:13,525
You do understand

1061
01:24:17,129 --> 01:24:19,131
That they can't let you leave?

1062
01:24:19,651 --> 01:24:20,652
I am a federal marshal ...

1063
01:24:21,413 --> 01:24:22,735
They can't stop me.

1064
01:24:24,136 --> 01:24:25,257
I was an esteemed psychiatrist,

1065
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:29,622
from a respected family.

1066
01:24:30,623 --> 01:24:32,144
It didn't matter.

1067
01:24:35,067 --> 01:24:36,148
Let me ask you ...

1068
01:24:37,149 --> 01:24:38,070
any past traumas in your life?

1069
01:24:42,955 --> 01:24:44,076
Yes. Why? Why would that matter?

1070
01:24:44,837 --> 01:24:46,439
Because they can point to some
event in your past and say

1071
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:48,841
it is the reason you lost your sanity......

1072
01:24:49,562 --> 01:24:51,164
So that when they commit you here

1073
01:24:51,764 --> 01:24:55,368
Your friends and colleagues will say,
"Of course he cracked."

1074
01:24:56,369 --> 01:24:58,891
"And who wouldn't have,
after what he'd been through."

1075
01:24:58,891 --> 01:25:01,254
That could be said of anyone

1076
01:25:01,374 --> 01:25:03,897
- anyone at all.
- The point is they're going to say it about you.

1077
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:08,701
How's your head?

1078
01:25:09,783 --> 01:25:12,305
- My head?
- Any funny dreams lately?

1079
01:25:12,986 --> 01:25:16,990
Trouble sleeping? Headaches?

1080
01:25:18,471 --> 01:25:20,193
I am prone to migraines. Yes.

1081
01:25:20,233 --> 01:25:21,194
Jesus!

1082
01:25:24,117 --> 01:25:25,318
You haven't taken any pills, have you?

1083
01:25:26,199 --> 01:25:28,539
- I mean even aspirin?
- They hit the aspirin?

1084
01:25:28,539 --> 01:25:30,045
Jesus!

1085
01:25:30,323 --> 01:25:33,407
And you ate the food in the cafeteria and drank
coffee they gave you.

1086
01:25:33,887 --> 01:25:36,009
You tell me at least that
you've been smoking your own cigarettes.

1087
01:25:38,612 --> 01:25:41,415
No... no.

1088
01:25:42,816 --> 01:25:44,017
No. I haven't.

1089
01:25:44,618 --> 01:25:47,541
It takes 36 to 48 hours for
neuroleptic narcotics...

1090
01:25:48,022 --> 01:25:51,025
To reach sufficient levels in
the blood stream.

1091
01:25:51,065 --> 01:25:52,826
Pulse becomes first

1092
01:25:53,827 --> 01:25:55,830
First the fingertips and then
eventually the whole hand.

1093
01:25:57,832 --> 01:26:01,035
Seen any waking nightmares lately,
marshal?

1094
01:26:04,318 --> 01:26:06,040
Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse?

1095
01:26:07,762 --> 01:26:08,843
Tell me.

1096
01:26:10,044 --> 01:26:11,926
Brain surgery.

1097
01:26:12,647 --> 01:26:16,370
"Let's open the skull and see
what happens if we pull on this" kind.

1098
01:26:16,931 --> 01:26:19,173
"We learned it from the Nazi's" kind.

1099
01:26:21,856 --> 01:26:23,578
It's where they create the ghosts.

1100
01:26:25,179 --> 01:26:27,061
Who knows about this?

1101
01:26:27,662 --> 01:26:29,384
On the island I mean. Who?

1102
01:26:31,746 --> 01:26:33,067
Everyone.

1103
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:36,471
Oh come on. The nurses? The orderlies?

1104
01:26:37,472 --> 01:26:39,874
- They couldn't possibly know...
- Everyone.

1105
01:26:58,093 --> 01:27:00,215
You can't stay here.

1106
01:27:00,696 --> 01:27:04,019
They think I'm dead, that I drowned. I'm afraid
if they come looking for you, they might find me.

1107
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:06,381
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

1108
01:27:13,509 --> 01:27:14,990
I'm gonna come back for you.

1109
01:27:15,231 --> 01:27:18,113
I won't be here. I move during the day.
new places every night.

1110
01:27:18,153 --> 01:27:20,436
But I could come get you
off of this island.

1111
01:27:20,436 --> 01:27:22,518
Haven't you heard a word I've said?

1112
01:27:23,119 --> 01:27:26,322
The only way off the island
is the ferry and they control it.

1113
01:27:26,922 --> 01:27:28,524
You'll never leave here.

1114
01:27:38,133 --> 01:27:39,454
I had a friend.

1115
01:27:39,935 --> 01:27:42,257
I was with him yesterday,
but we got separated.

1116
01:27:43,018 --> 01:27:44,539
Have you seen him?

1117
01:27:45,821 --> 01:27:47,342
Marshal...

1118
01:27:48,744 --> 01:27:50,465
You have no friends.

1119
01:28:21,898 --> 01:28:23,980
There you are.

1120
01:28:25,862 --> 01:28:28,184
We've been wondering when
you'd show up.

1121
01:28:30,066 --> 01:28:31,387
Have a seat.

1122
01:28:31,988 --> 01:28:33,189
Come on.

1123
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:46,002
Taking a leisurely stroll? Were we?

1124
01:28:47,203 --> 01:28:48,605
I was just...

1125
01:28:49,326 --> 01:28:50,607
just looking around.

1126
01:28:53,209 --> 01:28:55,212
Did you enjoy
God's latest gift?

1127
01:28:56,813 --> 01:28:58,815
- What?
- God's gift.

1128
01:29:00,337 --> 01:29:01,818
The violence.

1129
01:29:06,503 --> 01:29:09,826
When I came downstairs in my home
and I saw that tree in my living room,

1130
01:29:10,827 --> 01:29:12,830
it reached down for me like a divine hand.

1131
01:29:14,431 --> 01:29:16,113
God loves violence.

1132
01:29:19,116 --> 01:29:21,719
- I hadn't noticed.
- Sure you have.

1133
01:29:22,359 --> 01:29:24,041
Why else would there be so much of it?

1134
01:29:24,842 --> 01:29:26,243
It's in us.

1135
01:29:26,443 --> 01:29:27,645
It's what we are.

1136
01:29:29,366 --> 01:29:32,570
We wage war, we burn sacrifices,
we pillage and plunder

1137
01:29:32,650 --> 01:29:34,211
and tear at the flesh
of our brothers

1138
01:29:34,251 --> 01:29:38,055
and why? Because God gave us violence
to wage in his honor.

1139
01:29:41,259 --> 01:29:43,421
I thought God gave us moral order.

1140
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:46,063
There is no moral order
as pure as this storm.

1141
01:29:46,944 --> 01:29:48,946
There's no moral order at all.

1142
01:29:49,387 --> 01:29:52,870
There's just this:
can my violence conquer yours?

1143
01:29:58,276 --> 01:30:00,078
- I'm not violent.
- Yes you are.

1144
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:03,481
You're as violent as they come.

1145
01:30:04,562 --> 01:30:07,285
I know this because I'm as violent as they come.

1146
01:30:08,406 --> 01:30:10,168
With the constraints of society,
we are lifted and

1147
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:15,293
If I was all that stood between you and a meal, you
would crack my skull with a rock and eat my meaty parts.

1148
01:30:18,016 --> 01:30:19,498
Wouldn't you?

1149
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:25,824
Cawley thinks you're harmless, that you can be
controlled, but I know different.

1150
01:30:26,985 --> 01:30:30,909
- You don't know me.
- Oh but I do. Oh I know you.

1151
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:33,992
We've known each other for centuries.

1152
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:46,125
If I was to sink my teeth into your eye
right now,

1153
01:30:46,165 --> 01:30:49,328
would you be able to stop me before I blinded you?

1154
01:30:53,332 --> 01:30:54,854
Give it a try.

1155
01:30:56,335 --> 01:31:00,339
That's the spirit.

1156
01:31:43,583 --> 01:31:45,065
Where have you been?

1157
01:31:46,186 --> 01:31:48,268
Wandering, just looking at your island.

1158
01:31:48,388 --> 01:31:52,512
Oh I forgot. You're leaving.
Now that Rachel has been found.

1159
01:31:52,993 --> 01:31:54,394
Sure. Yeah.

1160
01:31:56,597 --> 01:31:57,798
Big meeting?

1161
01:31:58,398 --> 01:32:00,801
Oh, yes ...

1162
01:32:00,881 --> 01:32:03,404
Apparently there was an unidentified man
in ward C yesterday

1163
01:32:03,444 --> 01:32:06,807
He subdued a highly dangerous patient.
Quite handily.

1164
01:32:08,008 --> 01:32:09,009
Is that so?

1165
01:32:09,129 --> 01:32:13,534
It seems he had a long conversation with a
paranoid schizophrenic, George Noyce.

1166
01:32:16,537 --> 01:32:19,300
This Noyce,
you said his name was,

1167
01:32:20,221 --> 01:32:23,264
- he's delusional?
- Oh extremely. He can be quite upsetting.

1168
01:32:23,304 --> 01:32:26,307
In fact, two weeks ago, a patient
got so wound up

1169
01:32:26,347 --> 01:32:30,111
by one of Noyce's stories
that he beat him up.

1170
01:32:30,431 --> 01:32:31,953
Cigarette?

1171
01:32:33,314 --> 01:32:35,036
Oh. No, thanks.
I quit.

1172
01:32:36,637 --> 01:32:38,639
So, you're taking the ferry?

1173
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:40,561
Oh yes. Absolutely. I uh...

1174
01:32:41,242 --> 01:32:42,964
I think we've gotten
all we came here for so.

1175
01:32:43,845 --> 01:32:44,966
"We" marshal?

1176
01:32:47,128 --> 01:32:48,770
Speaking of which. Have you

1177
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:51,573
- seen him, Doctor?
- Who?

1178
01:32:52,454 --> 01:32:53,975
My partner, Chuck.

1179
01:32:56,658 --> 01:32:58,580
You don't have a partner, Marshal.
You came here alone.

1180
01:33:01,062 --> 01:33:03,545
You know, I've built something valuable here.

1181
01:33:03,585 --> 01:33:06,948
And valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time.

1182
01:33:07,068 --> 01:33:08,950
Everyone wants a quick fix,
they always have.

1183
01:33:09,071 --> 01:33:12,474
I'm trying to do something that people,
yourself included, don't understand.

1184
01:33:12,594 --> 01:33:14,957
And I'm not going to give up
without a fight.

1185
01:33:16,358 --> 01:33:18,800
I can see that...

1186
01:33:22,484 --> 01:33:24,286
So tell me again
about your partner.

1187
01:33:26,168 --> 01:33:28,010
What partner?

1188
01:34:30,435 --> 01:34:32,076
Marshal...

1189
01:34:33,358 --> 01:34:34,759
Going somewhere?

1190
01:34:35,239 --> 01:34:38,763
No. Just heading out
to the ferry. So...

1191
01:34:40,365 --> 01:34:41,966
I'm afraid it's the other way.

1192
01:34:44,889 --> 01:34:46,691
If you wait a moment,

1193
01:34:47,252 --> 01:34:50,095
I'll find someone who can take you
to the dock.

1194
01:34:53,778 --> 01:34:56,221
What is this, doctor?

1195
01:34:56,261 --> 01:34:58,703
It's just a sedative.

1196
01:34:58,783 --> 01:35:01,306
- It's for precaution.
- Precaution?

1197
01:35:03,708 --> 01:35:07,793
What are you going to do?
Kill me? Marshal.

1198
01:35:08,313 --> 01:35:09,595
You think you deserve it?

1199
01:35:10,075 --> 01:35:12,798
For what?
For provoking you?

1200
01:35:13,318 --> 01:35:15,801
and, forgive me,
what doesn't provoke you?

1201
01:35:16,201 --> 01:35:17,322
Remarks...

1202
01:35:17,723 --> 01:35:19,084
- Words...
- Nazis!

1203
01:35:19,925 --> 01:35:21,407
Well that, too.

1204
01:35:21,927 --> 01:35:23,609
And of course, memories, dreams...

1205
01:35:24,810 --> 01:35:28,734
Did you know that the word "trauma" comes
from the Greek for "wound"?

1206
01:35:29,215 --> 01:35:33,299
And what is the German word for "dream"
"Traumen".

1207
01:35:33,339 --> 01:35:34,420
Traumen.

1208
01:35:35,741 --> 01:35:38,424
Wounds can create monsters.

1209
01:35:38,744 --> 01:35:41,227
And you ...
you are wounded, marshal.

1210
01:35:42,228 --> 01:35:45,031
Wouldn't you agree,
when you see a monster

1211
01:35:45,831 --> 01:35:47,233
you must stop it?

1212
01:35:50,236 --> 01:35:52,238
- I agree.
- Yes...

1213
01:36:37,004 --> 01:36:38,685
What are you doing, baby?

1214
01:36:43,811 --> 01:36:45,372
You've got to get to the ferry.

1215
01:36:46,013 --> 01:36:48,095
No. No.
No.

1216
01:36:52,099 --> 01:36:55,903
If the world thinks that Chuck is dead,
then he is perfect for their experiments.

1217
01:36:56,504 --> 01:36:58,986
There's only one place they'd take him.

1218
01:37:01,509 --> 01:37:03,911
You go there and you'll die.

1219
01:37:03,991 --> 01:37:07,835
He's my partner. If they are hurting him, if they are
holding him against his will, I've got to bring him out.

1220
01:37:08,196 --> 01:37:10,198
I can't lose anyone else.

1221
01:37:10,838 --> 01:37:14,842
Don't go, Teddy.
Please don't do this. Don't go.

1222
01:37:17,725 --> 01:37:19,607
I'm sorry, honey.

1223
01:37:21,329 --> 01:37:23,932
I love this thing because
you gave it to me

1224
01:37:26,614 --> 01:37:28,536
But the truth is ...

1225
01:37:28,616 --> 01:37:31,539
it's one fucking ugly tie.

1226
01:38:10,379 --> 01:38:11,500
No!

1227
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:31,862
Don't move!
Stay where you are!

1228
01:39:33,464 --> 01:39:35,065
Are you going to kill me?

1229
01:39:35,466 --> 01:39:39,390
No.
I'm not gonna kill you.

1230
01:41:27,099 --> 01:41:29,861
Why are you all wet, baby?

1231
01:41:30,983 --> 01:41:33,385
- What did you say?
- You know exactly what I said.

1232
01:41:46,318 --> 01:41:48,681
The rifle's empty by the way.

1233
01:41:54,126 --> 01:41:55,928
Have a seat.

1234
01:42:02,415 --> 01:42:05,498
For god's sake dry off
you're going to catch a cold.

1235
01:42:06,619 --> 01:42:07,620
Alright.

1236
01:42:10,223 --> 01:42:12,905
How badly did you hurt the guard?

1237
01:42:15,508 --> 01:42:17,630
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1238
01:42:20,353 --> 01:42:21,915
Yes. He's here.

1239
01:42:22,435 --> 01:42:25,358
Have Dr.Sheehan take a good look
at your man before you send him up.

1240
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,842
So, Dr. Shehan...

1241
01:42:29,442 --> 01:42:30,643
He came on the ferry
this morining.

1242
01:42:31,645 --> 01:42:32,646
Not exactly.

1243
01:42:34,367 --> 01:42:36,850
You blew up my car.
I really loved that car.

1244
01:42:38,171 --> 01:42:39,853
Sorry to hear about that.

1245
01:42:43,176 --> 01:42:44,738
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

1246
01:42:46,179 --> 01:42:47,260
How are the hallucinations?

1247
01:42:48,261 --> 01:42:49,663
Get out of here, Teddy.

1248
01:42:50,864 --> 01:42:52,666
This place is gonna be the end of you.

1249
01:42:55,589 --> 01:42:58,272
- Not bad.
- They'll get worse.

1250
01:42:58,752 --> 01:42:59,793
I know.

1251
01:43:00,674 --> 01:43:02,076
Dr. Solando...

1252
01:43:02,997 --> 01:43:05,359
She told me about neuroleptics.

1253
01:43:05,479 --> 01:43:08,682
Did she now?
And when was this?

1254
01:43:08,802 --> 01:43:13,567
I found the doctor, in a cave out by the cliffs.
But you'll never get to her.

1255
01:43:13,687 --> 01:43:15,209
I don't doubt it.

1256
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:17,571
Considering she's not real.

1257
01:43:19,093 --> 01:43:21,495
But your hallucinations are
more severe than I thought.

1258
01:43:22,977 --> 01:43:24,899
You are not on neuroleptics.

1259
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:28,222
You are not on anything
as a matter of fact.

1260
01:43:28,222 --> 01:43:30,505
Then what the fuck is this?
Huh, what the fuck is this?

1261
01:43:30,625 --> 01:43:31,626
Withdrawal.

1262
01:43:31,906 --> 01:43:33,107
Withdrawal?

1263
01:43:33,508 --> 01:43:36,310
From what? I haven't even had a Goddamned
drink since I've been on this island.

1264
01:43:36,351 --> 01:43:37,632
Chlorpromazine.

1265
01:43:37,992 --> 01:43:41,636
I'm not a fan of pharmacology
but I have to say in your case ...

1266
01:43:42,517 --> 01:43:44,799
- Clorpro... what?
- Chlorpromazine.

1267
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:49,924
The same thing we've
been giving you for the past 24 months.

1268
01:43:51,326 --> 01:43:53,728
So for the past two years

1269
01:43:53,808 --> 01:43:56,331
you've had somebody slipping
me drugs in Boston. Is that it?

1270
01:43:56,371 --> 01:43:58,653
Not Boston.
Here.

1271
01:43:59,654 --> 01:44:03,939
You've been here for two years.
A patient of this institution.

1272
01:44:06,621 --> 01:44:10,545
After everything I seen here, doctor,

1273
01:44:11,026 --> 01:44:13,468
you really think you're gonna
convince me I'm crazy, huh?

1274
01:44:13,548 --> 01:44:17,753
Do you know the kind of people I deal with everyday?
I'm a U.S. marshal. For Gods sake.

1275
01:44:18,273 --> 01:44:21,917
You were a U.S. marshal.
Here's a copy of the intake form.

1276
01:44:21,957 --> 01:44:25,160
You broke into ward C for
proof of the 67th patient

1277
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:28,163
If you'd gotten it to the mainland,
you could have blown the lid off this place.

1278
01:44:28,684 --> 01:44:29,965
- Wait... wait.
- But somehow

1279
01:44:30,045 --> 01:44:31,767
you couldn't find time
to look at it. Well read it now.

1280
01:44:32,968 --> 01:44:34,170
Go ahead.

1281
01:44:37,853 --> 01:44:39,975
The patient is highly intelligent,
highly delusional.

1282
01:44:40,056 --> 01:44:41,497
Decorated army veteran.

1283
01:44:42,058 --> 01:44:43,499
Present for the
liberation of Dakau.

1284
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:46,502
Former U.S. marshal.

1285
01:44:46,862 --> 01:44:48,184
Known proclivity for violence.

1286
01:44:48,304 --> 01:44:49,986
Shows no remorse for his crime because
he denies

1287
01:44:50,066 --> 01:44:53,389
that the crime ever took place.
Highly developed and fantastical

1288
01:44:53,429 --> 01:44:56,592
narratives which preclude facing
the truth of his actions...

1289
01:44:56,713 --> 01:44:57,794
I've had enough of this bullshit.

1290
01:44:57,874 --> 01:44:59,195
Where's my partner, huh?

1291
01:44:59,315 --> 01:45:00,797
Where's Chuck?
Where is he?

1292
01:45:02,118 --> 01:45:03,800
Let's try this another way.

1293
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:06,282
Your wife's maiden name was
"Chanal". Am I correct?

1294
01:45:06,322 --> 01:45:08,525
- Don't you even talk about her!
- I'm afraid I have to.

1295
01:45:10,206 --> 01:45:13,089
Notice anything these four names have in common?

1296
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:14,691
Your rule of 4.

1297
01:45:15,211 --> 01:45:17,614
- Andrew, what do you see?
- If you have done anything

1298
01:45:17,694 --> 01:45:21,698
- to my partner, doctor. That is a violation ...
- Focus, Andrew. What do you see?

1299
01:45:22,419 --> 01:45:24,821
The names ...
have the same letters.

1300
01:45:24,901 --> 01:45:27,344
Edward Daniels has exactly the same
13 letters

1301
01:45:27,424 --> 01:45:29,906
as Andrew Laeddis.
The same as Rachel Solando

1302
01:45:29,946 --> 01:45:32,349
and Dolores Chanal. The names

1303
01:45:32,429 --> 01:45:34,751
- Are anagrams for each other.
- Your tactics, they're not going to

1304
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:36,713
work on me.

1305
01:45:36,753 --> 01:45:39,036
You came here for the truth.
Here it is.

1306
01:45:39,236 --> 01:45:40,838
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

1307
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:44,762
The 67th patient at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

1308
01:45:45,442 --> 01:45:46,844
Bullshit.

1309
01:45:47,124 --> 01:45:49,566
You were committed here by
court order 24 months ago.

1310
01:45:49,647 --> 01:45:52,850
Your crime is terrible.
One you can't forgive yourself for.

1311
01:45:52,890 --> 01:45:54,652
So you invented
another self.

1312
01:45:59,537 --> 01:46:00,658
Let's get down to the facts.

1313
01:46:01,178 --> 01:46:05,062
You've created a story in which
you're not a murderer, you are hero.

1314
01:46:05,463 --> 01:46:06,944
Still a U.S marshal.

1315
01:46:06,984 --> 01:46:08,386
Only here at Ashecliffe
because of a case

1316
01:46:08,666 --> 01:46:09,987
and you've uncovered a conspiracy

1317
01:46:10,388 --> 01:46:12,750
So that anything we tell you about
who you are, what you've done

1318
01:46:13,391 --> 01:46:15,873
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.

1319
01:46:15,913 --> 01:46:16,994
My name is Edward Daniels.

1320
01:46:17,595 --> 01:46:20,398
I've been hearing this fantasy
for two years now. I know every detail.

1321
01:46:20,758 --> 01:46:23,162
Patient 67. The storm.
Rachel Solando.

1322
01:46:23,282 --> 01:46:25,804
Your missing partner.
The dreams you have every night.

1323
01:46:25,804 --> 01:46:28,167
You were at Dakau,
But you may not have killed any guards.

1324
01:46:32,091 --> 01:46:34,974
I wish I could let you just
live in your fantasy world.

1325
01:46:35,494 --> 01:46:36,696
I really do.

1326
01:46:37,176 --> 01:46:41,821
But you're violent, trained, dangerous.
You're the most dangerous patient we have.

1327
01:46:42,181 --> 01:46:44,624
You've injured orderlies. Guards.
Other patients.

1328
01:46:44,704 --> 01:46:47,186
Two weeks ago
you attacked George Noyce.

1329
01:46:47,226 --> 01:46:48,708
No, no! I am fucking on to you doctor!

1330
01:46:48,908 --> 01:46:50,710
- You had Noyce beaten.
- Of course I didn't.

1331
01:46:50,910 --> 01:46:52,912
Give me one reason
why I would even touch him.

1332
01:46:53,032 --> 01:46:54,834
Because he called you Laeddis

1333
01:46:54,914 --> 01:46:57,116
and you do anything not to be him.

1334
01:46:58,438 --> 01:47:00,920
I have a transcript of that conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday.

1335
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:05,125
This is about you and Laeddis.
That's all it's ever been about

1336
01:47:07,247 --> 01:47:09,729
No. No. He is saying that it's about
"me and Laeddis".

1337
01:47:09,769 --> 01:47:12,212
When you've asked him what happened
to his face,

1338
01:47:12,252 --> 01:47:14,534
said, and I quote again,
"You did this".

1339
01:47:15,055 --> 01:47:18,458
- No. He meant it was my fault he...
- You almost killed him.

1340
01:47:20,821 --> 01:47:24,464
The warden and the board of overseers
are determined something be done. It's been decided.

1341
01:47:25,345 --> 01:47:29,229
That unless, we can bring you back into sanity now,
right now,

1342
01:47:29,870 --> 01:47:32,753
permanent measures will be taken to ensure
you can't hurt anyone ever again.

1343
01:47:36,477 --> 01:47:38,679
They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.

1344
01:47:38,759 --> 01:47:40,160
Do you understand?

1345
01:47:44,044 --> 01:47:45,245
Yes, I understand.

1346
01:47:46,166 --> 01:47:48,048
I understand just fine.

1347
01:47:49,250 --> 01:47:53,134
If... if I don't play along
with your little game here.

1348
01:47:53,174 --> 01:47:55,696
Dr. Naehring is gonna turn me into
one of his ghosts.

1349
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:57,298
What about my partner?

1350
01:47:57,978 --> 01:48:02,103
You're gonna tell the U.S. marshal's office
that he's a defense mechanism?

1351
01:48:04,105 --> 01:48:05,306
Hello, boss.

1352
01:48:23,124 --> 01:48:26,007
What the fuck is going on here?

1353
01:48:29,090 --> 01:48:30,612
You working for him?

1354
01:48:31,092 --> 01:48:36,017
I'm sorry about that
someone had to stick with you. Keep you safe.

1355
01:48:38,099 --> 01:48:39,941
You've been watching me, huh?

1356
01:48:40,622 --> 01:48:42,424
Watching me every minute.

1357
01:48:44,226 --> 01:48:45,547
Who... who are you?

1358
01:48:45,947 --> 01:48:47,229
Who are you?
Tell me.

1359
01:48:47,749 --> 01:48:49,431
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?

1360
01:48:51,233 --> 01:48:53,755
I've been you primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

1361
01:48:55,037 --> 01:48:56,438
I am Lester Sheehan.

1362
01:49:02,444 --> 01:49:04,847
And I told you about my wife ...

1363
01:49:05,047 --> 01:49:08,050
- I know.
- I climbed down a cliff to get you.

1364
01:49:08,771 --> 01:49:12,695
I trusted you. I risked
everything to come in here after you. Everything!

1365
01:49:12,775 --> 01:49:13,816
I know, boss.

1366
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:15,458
We're running out of time here, Andrew,

1367
01:49:16,859 --> 01:49:19,341
I swore before the entire board of
overseers that I could construct

1368
01:49:19,382 --> 01:49:21,784
The most radical, cutting edge role-play

1369
01:49:21,864 --> 01:49:24,347
ever attempted in psychiatry and
it would bring you back.

1370
01:49:24,387 --> 01:49:26,869
I thought if we let you play
this out

1371
01:49:27,590 --> 01:49:30,473
we could get you to see how
untrue, how impossible it is.

1372
01:49:32,155 --> 01:49:33,476
We've had to run of the place for two days.

1373
01:49:34,157 --> 01:49:36,879
Tell me, where are the Nazi experiments?

1374
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:39,482
The satanic O.R.'s?

1375
01:49:52,215 --> 01:49:53,817
Andrew, listen to me.

1376
01:49:56,179 --> 01:49:57,701
If we fail with you

1377
01:49:58,902 --> 01:50:01,104
then everything we've tried
to do here will be discredited.

1378
01:50:01,224 --> 01:50:02,305
Everything.

1379
01:50:04,628 --> 01:50:06,790
We are on the front line of a war here, old boy.

1380
01:50:08,311 --> 01:50:10,634
And right now, it'll come down to you.

1381
01:50:17,321 --> 01:50:19,323
Don't move! Don't move!

1382
01:50:19,403 --> 01:50:22,406
- Andrew, no!
- My name is Edward Daniels.

1383
01:50:23,327 --> 01:50:26,050
This one is loaded.
I can tell by the weight.

1384
01:50:26,130 --> 01:50:28,132
I see. And that's your firearm marshal?
You're sure?

1385
01:50:28,652 --> 01:50:30,134
My initials are on the side and there's a dent in the
barrel from when Philip Stacks shot at me.

1386
01:50:30,214 --> 01:50:34,338
You're not going to fuck with my mind on this
one Doc

1387
01:50:34,378 --> 01:50:37,341
Then blast away, because that's the
only way you're ever getting off this island.

1388
01:50:43,948 --> 01:50:45,349
Andrew, please don't.

1389
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:57,081
My gun...

1390
01:51:03,968 --> 01:51:05,490
What have you done to
my Goddamn gun.

1391
01:51:06,571 --> 01:51:08,052
It's a toy, Andrew.

1392
01:51:10,775 --> 01:51:12,297
We're telling you the truth.

1393
01:51:13,778 --> 01:51:16,982
Dolores was insane. Manic-depressive.
Suicidal.

1394
01:51:17,462 --> 01:51:20,545
You drank. Stayed away.
Ignored what everyone had told you.

1395
01:51:20,585 --> 01:51:23,468
You moved to that lake house after
she, purposely,

1396
01:51:23,588 --> 01:51:26,111
set your city apartment on fire

1397
01:51:26,271 --> 01:51:27,913
Andrew! Andrew!
Stop it!

1398
01:51:30,115 --> 01:51:31,116
You're lying...

1399
01:51:31,596 --> 01:51:33,278
Andrew, your children.

1400
01:51:34,119 --> 01:51:35,280
Simon...

1401
01:51:36,201 --> 01:51:38,804
- Henry...
- I didn't have any children.

1402
01:51:39,004 --> 01:51:40,405
Your wife drowned them.

1403
01:51:40,806 --> 01:51:43,288
At the cabin by the lake.

1404
01:51:43,408 --> 01:51:45,491
And here, the little girl,
the one you dream of

1405
01:51:46,131 --> 01:51:47,212
every night.

1406
01:51:47,933 --> 01:51:49,094
I never had a little.

1407
01:51:49,134 --> 01:51:53,018
The one who tells you over and over that
you should have saved her

1408
01:51:53,098 --> 01:51:54,220
Saved them all.

1409
01:51:54,820 --> 01:51:55,941
Your daughter...

1410
01:51:56,422 --> 01:51:59,305
Her name was Rachel. Are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

1411
01:52:00,546 --> 01:52:01,627
Andrew, are you?

1412
01:52:24,850 --> 01:52:26,251
I'm so sorry, baby...

1413
01:52:30,656 --> 01:52:32,458
I told you not to come in here.

1414
01:52:33,058 --> 01:52:34,339
I told you...

1415
01:52:35,180 --> 01:52:37,463
this would be the end of you.

1416
01:52:57,083 --> 01:52:59,485
I'm back.
We got him

1417
01:52:59,605 --> 01:53:02,088
just outside of Oklahoma.
Must of stopped ten places

1418
01:53:02,128 --> 01:53:05,091
in between here and Tulsa.
I could sleep for a week.

1419
01:53:09,415 --> 01:53:10,576
Dolores?

1420
01:53:17,584 --> 01:53:19,305
Dolores?

1421
01:53:24,111 --> 01:53:26,513
Dolores?

1422
01:53:39,327 --> 01:53:41,328
Dolores?

1423
01:54:05,352 --> 01:54:06,874
Baby...

1424
01:54:09,076 --> 01:54:10,357
why are you all wet?

1425
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:14,762
I missed you.

1426
01:54:21,369 --> 01:54:24,372
I want to go home.

1427
01:54:24,892 --> 01:54:28,095
You are home!

1428
01:54:31,899 --> 01:54:33,901
Where are the kids?

1429
01:54:38,386 --> 01:54:40,668
They're in school.

1430
01:54:44,312 --> 01:54:46,314
It's Saturday, honey.

1431
01:54:46,795 --> 01:54:48,676
School's not in on Saturday.

1432
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:53,081
My school is.

1433
01:55:05,934 --> 01:55:07,936
Oh my God!

1434
01:55:10,299 --> 01:55:11,620
My God!

1435
01:55:25,514 --> 01:55:27,356
God!

1436
01:55:30,039 --> 01:55:33,362
Oh my God, no!

1437
01:55:36,045 --> 01:55:37,646
Come on!
Come on!

1438
01:55:55,064 --> 01:55:57,467
Please, God, no.

1439
01:55:57,547 --> 01:56:01,070
No!

1440
01:56:01,871 --> 01:56:03,072
No!

1441
01:56:08,478 --> 01:56:09,599
No!

1442
01:56:12,082 --> 01:56:13,003
No!

1443
01:57:14,146 --> 01:57:16,427
Let's put them in the room.

1444
01:57:17,269 --> 01:57:19,550
We'll dry them off...

1445
01:57:20,071 --> 01:57:21,673
We'll change their clothes...

1446
01:57:23,434 --> 01:57:26,638
They'll be our living dolls.

1447
01:57:29,561 --> 01:57:31,082
Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.

1448
01:57:37,649 --> 01:57:39,170
If you ever loved me, Dolores...

1449
01:57:39,651 --> 01:57:41,373
Please stop talking.

1450
01:57:46,779 --> 01:57:49,301
I love you.

1451
01:57:57,589 --> 01:57:59,191
Set me free!

1452
01:58:04,596 --> 01:58:05,477
Honey...

1453
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:09,722
We'll give them baths...

1454
01:58:16,889 --> 01:58:18,811
- I love you so much, Dolores.
- And I love you. I love you.

1455
01:58:48,843 --> 01:58:51,045
Andrew...

1456
01:58:52,566 --> 01:58:54,168
Andrew, can you hear me?

1457
01:58:55,930 --> 01:58:58,973
Rachel!
Rachel, Rachel...

1458
01:59:00,975 --> 01:59:01,976
Rachel.

1459
01:59:04,338 --> 01:59:05,860
Rachel who?

1460
01:59:09,464 --> 01:59:10,465
Rachel Laeddis...

1461
01:59:12,066 --> 01:59:13,187
My daughter.

1462
01:59:16,951 --> 01:59:18,473
Why are you here?

1463
01:59:21,796 --> 01:59:23,398
Because I killed my wife.

1464
01:59:23,678 --> 01:59:24,959
and why did you do that?

1465
01:59:29,685 --> 01:59:32,487
She murdered our children.

1466
01:59:33,689 --> 01:59:36,291
And she told me to let her go.

1467
01:59:39,295 --> 01:59:43,418
- Who is Teddy Daniels?
- He doesn't exist.

1468
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:46,302
Neither does Rachel Solando.
I made them up.

1469
01:59:47,023 --> 01:59:48,704
Why?

1470
01:59:49,505 --> 01:59:51,787
We need to hear you say it.

1471
01:59:57,514 --> 02:00:00,396
After she tried to kill
herself the first time,

1472
02:00:01,918 --> 02:00:03,119
Dolores told me she...

1473
02:00:04,721 --> 02:00:06,323
she had an insect...

1474
02:00:07,924 --> 02:00:09,246
living inside her brain.

1475
02:00:10,847 --> 02:00:11,608
She could feel it...

1476
02:00:14,331 --> 02:00:15,932
clicking across
her skull...

1477
02:00:18,015 --> 02:00:20,537
pulling the wires,
just for fun.

1478
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:25,142
She told me that.

1479
02:00:26,023 --> 02:00:28,025
She told me but I didn't listen.

1480
02:00:33,269 --> 02:00:34,951
I loved her so much.

1481
02:00:37,153 --> 02:00:38,474
Why did you make them up?

1482
02:00:40,757 --> 02:00:43,960
Because I can't take knowing
that Dolores killed our children.

1483
02:00:51,848 --> 02:00:55,692
I killed them, because
I didn't get her help.

1484
02:01:00,027 --> 02:01:02,980
I killed them...

1485
02:01:06,583 --> 02:01:10,507
Here's my theory, Andrew.
we broke through once before,

1486
02:01:10,587 --> 02:01:13,310
nine months ago,
and then you regressed.

1487
02:01:15,073 --> 02:01:18,196
- I don't remember that.
- I know.

1488
02:01:19,316 --> 02:01:22,399
You reset, Andrew.
Like a tape

1489
02:01:22,519 --> 02:01:26,603
playing over and over on an endless loop.

1490
02:01:26,804 --> 02:01:29,727
I hope that what we've done will be enough
to stop it from ever happening again

1491
02:01:29,727 --> 02:01:32,209
But I need to know ...

1492
02:01:32,249 --> 02:01:34,732
you have accepted the reality.

1493
02:01:40,818 --> 02:01:43,821
You came after me, huh, doctor?

1494
02:01:46,624 --> 02:01:49,427
You tried to help me when no one else would.

1495
02:02:00,838 --> 02:02:03,241
My name is Andrew Laeddis...

1496
02:02:09,247 --> 02:02:13,371
And I murdered my wife
in the spring of '52.

1497
02:02:36,955 --> 02:02:38,797
How we doing this morning?

1498
02:02:39,278 --> 02:02:40,799
Good.
And You?

1499
02:02:40,959 --> 02:02:42,961
Can't complain.

1500
02:02:51,411 --> 02:02:53,013
So what's our next move?

1501
02:02:53,773 --> 02:02:55,095
You tell me.

1502
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:02,102
I've gotta get off this rock,
Chuck.

1503
02:03:04,503 --> 02:03:07,787
Get back to the mainland. Whatever the
hell is going on here. It's bad.

1504
02:03:28,209 --> 02:03:30,331
Don't worry, partner.
They're not gonna catch us.

1505
02:03:37,937 --> 02:03:39,339
That's right. We're too smart for them.

1506
02:03:41,461 --> 02:03:43,143
Yeah, we are.
Aren't we?

1507
02:03:58,039 --> 02:04:00,641
You know this place makes
me wonder.

1508
02:04:01,562 --> 02:04:03,083
Yeah? What's that boss?

1509
02:04:04,765 --> 02:04:06,166
Which would be worse?

1510
02:04:07,568 --> 02:04:08,169
To live as a monster ...

1511
02:04:08,850 --> 02:04:11,092
or to die as a good man.

1512
02:04:19,581 --> 02:04:21,502
Teddy?

1513
02:05:05,020 --> 02:05:25,520
