1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,491
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,841
So my brother's a Ghost.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,610
Ten years ago,
I found out you were dealing.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,121
Yeah. You convinced me to enlist.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,488
You saw what kind of man my brother was,
what kind of man he is.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,682
He's your family.
You said he was a good man.

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,803
- Maybe a part of him still is.
- I don't know.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,560
The damage to her spinal cord,
it's permanent.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,330
<i>She's never gonna walk again.</i>

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,327
If we don't get home soon,

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,329
the sitter's gonna charge us
an extra hour.

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,205
We should have taken the car.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,689
Sitter's what, another 15 bucks
for half an hour?

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,842
It's a bargain at twice the price.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,487
Lyla.

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,647
Dear God.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,285
- Alan.
- Sorry to crash your evening.

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,806
Then don't. Just call like normal people.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,490
I don't have a normal job.

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,966
And I've been compromised.

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,241
I'm not A.R.G.U.S. anymore.

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,090
Which makes you the only person
I can trust.

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,321
I need you to tell Waller...

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,567
Get down!

25
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,441
You're hit.

26
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,807
No!

27
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,087
Alan!

28
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,647
Johnnie!

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,045
Are you okay?

30
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,925
You were right.
We should've taken the car.

31
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,491
Just be careful. Slow down, slow down.

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,091
Careful, careful, careful...

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,850
Do you want me to be careful?

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,844
Oh, this is more Oliver 2.0, isn't it?

35
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,724
You think being cute
is going to distract me?

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,526
Mission accomplished.

37
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,406
You don't have to wait on me
hand and foot.

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,684
Though I wouldn't say no to a blanket.

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,722
The doctor says
stick with the two tablets,

40
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,086
keep with your current
pain management regimen.

41
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,810
You know, I really appreciate
what you're doing,

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,287
but you have a city to save,
a mayoral campaign,

43
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,404
a freaky super-bad
who can move things with his mind.

44
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,611
None of which are nearly as important
as your recovery. Thank you.

45
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,040
I think the people in the city

46
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,049
that Darhk wants to destroy
might disagree.

47
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,129
Well, those people should know
that I stand no chance

48
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,010
of stopping Damien Darhk
without your help.

49
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,651
Well, you might have to.

50
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,809
I have a spinal cord injury.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,243
I might never make a full recovery ever.

52
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,601
That is worst case scenario.

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,202
And either way, you're still
a vital member of the team.

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,641
Your superpower is right there.

55
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,284
Maybe my new codename could be Hot Wheels.

56
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,370
Keep pitching on that.

57
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,167
All jokes aside, like you said,

58
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,930
what I do bring to the team is my mind

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,168
and there's a lot on it.

60
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,327
So talk to me.

61
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,528
I just don't think I'm ready
to come back yet,

62
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,963
and the last thing you need
in a life or limb situation is me.

63
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,886
Wow. We are going to agree to
disagree on that one for the moment.

64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,847
What's going on?

65
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,246
John and Lyla were attacked.

66
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,407
Oh, my God, are they okay?

67
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,250
John was shot. Flesh wound.

68
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,527
I should go see them.

69
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,801
We should go see them.

70
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,601
Nice try.

71
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,489
Dinner is in the fridge.
Reheat in the oven at 425 degrees.

72
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,887
I love you.

73
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,241
I love you, too.

74
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,771
And they just left you there?

75
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,769
Yeah, but not before
leaving me with this.

76
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,088
We are sure that this wasn't HIVE?

77
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,645
These men looked military.

78
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,161
Right. But you said
that Chang said he was compromised

79
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,482
and he specifically told you
to go and speak with Waller.

80
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,967
Knowing her, she had Alan
working on something off the books.

81
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,610
- I need to call the sitter.
- Okay.

82
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,168
We need to find Chang before this
kidnapping becomes something worse.

83
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,124
Yeah, well, the van didn't have
any plates on it.

84
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,290
And Chang's phone is A.R.G.U.S.-issued,
which means it'll be untraceable.

85
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,130
We could really use Felicity's help
right now.

86
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,210
Yeah, she's not up for it yet.

87
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,808
I can have SCPD see if John's bullet
is connected to any open cases.

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,967
Yeah.

89
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,925
I can go check the crime scene
for any leftover evidence.

90
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,411
You should go to Starling General
and have that looked at.

91
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,130
<i>- I'll be fine.
- Why?</i>

92
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,288
Because eating a cheeseburger
is a better option?

93
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,965
This isn't for me.

94
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,207
It's for Andy.

95
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,051
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

96
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,128
Hey, what happened to your arm?

97
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,131
Nothing. It's occupational hazard.

98
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,766
Right. I never pegged you
for the masked vigilante type.

99
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,281
Yeah, well, I guess
we're both full of surprises, Andy.

100
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,850
You know what?

101
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,330
You keep coming down here
asking me all these questions,

102
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,204
but I never get to ask them back.

103
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,888
- What do you wanna know?
- All right.

104
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,004
How do you end up working
out of a basement or wherever we are,

105
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,363
and fighting crime with a guy
who wears a green hoodie?

106
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,683
Well, he's a good man.
And we're not fighting crime, Andy.

107
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,809
We're taking a city that's holding
itself together and we are helping.

108
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,890
Don't you remember
when that was your mission?

109
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,848
Appreciate you two volunteering
for this mission.

110
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,481
A chance to ride with my little brother?
Wouldn't miss it.

111
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,047
Yeah, Taliban's not ready
for the Diggle brothers.

112
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,323
HQ's got eyes on a primo opium shipment

113
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,885
that's been funding the local arms trade.

114
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,127
We cut them off,

115
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,891
the terrorists will be left with nothing
but rocks and sticks to fight us.

116
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,969
Copy that, sir. You ready for this?

117
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,249
Incoming. Stay frosty, boys.

118
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,441
Copy that.

119
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,681
RPG!

120
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,964
- Perimeter!
- Go!

121
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,447
Go, go! Move, move, move!

122
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,891
We're screwed if they come around
from the other side.

123
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,806
I'll see if I can buy us some time.
Move, move, move.

124
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,767
I can draw them to it.

125
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,961
Got your back.

126
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,521
Come on. Come on. Come on!

127
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,721
It's in.

128
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,681
Screw this!

129
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,887
Andy!

130
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,161
Hey!

131
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,881
(And)'-

132
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,485
Talk to me, man. You okay?

133
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,447
Did we get them?

134
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,605
You got 'em, brother. Let's go.

135
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,210
<i>Aww, why didn't I get invited
to this pity party?</i>

136
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,484
Hello?

137
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,848
<i>At least you found the right party favors.</i>

138
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,567
<i>Three pills is a bit much,
but who am I to judge?</i>

139
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,761
Okay, whoever you are,

140
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,406
you picked the wrong woman
on the wrong night to mess with.

141
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,888
<i>Please. We both know
you're in no position to do anything.</i>

142
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,646
<i>If you did you'd be back out in
the world instead of holed up here.</i>

143
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,242
Oh, my God. What is going on?

144
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,206
What is going on? Oh, my God.

145
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,324
Oh, my God, lam losing it.

146
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,931
I am completely and utterly losing it. Oh!

147
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,084
Now I am talking to myself.

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,001
<i>Not exactly.</i>

149
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,244
Laurel Lance, District Attorney's Office.

150
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,287
What do we have here?

151
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,051
Deceased male. Around 35. Asian.

152
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,891
Multiple lacerations, contusions
and blunt force trauma.

153
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,445
You canvass the area yet?

154
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,369
There could be a witness
who saw something.

155
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,722
I don't need an ADA
to tell me how to do my job.

156
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,410
Well, I'm sure
there's a murderer out there

157
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,602
who appreciates your lack of initiative.

158
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,326
Go ahead.

159
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,280
Private security found him
at the start of the graveyard shift.

160
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,290
That's Chang.
Whoever did this took their time.

161
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,131
Multiple lacerations to the knees,
a broken arm,

162
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,800
at least three pulled fingernails.

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,286
They were torturing him for something.

164
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,680
Information wasn't the only thing
they wanted.

165
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,725
I told you, what Agent Chang
was working on is none of your concern.

166
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,126
It's even less of yours.

167
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,327
Thought that would change
once you found out

168
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,284
that Chang was mutilated,
tortured and killed.

169
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,131
I'm afraid you've over-extended
your welcome, Mr. Diggle.

170
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,163
Which is A.R.G.U.S.-speak
for "get the hell out of here."

171
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,408
You always were a quick study.

172
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,362
I mean this with all sincerity,
your presence has truly been missed.

173
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,128
Even if I don't show it, I am deeply
regretful for Mr. Chang's death.

174
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,050
Hopefully we'll meet again
under happier circumstances.

175
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,686
Of course.

176
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,648
Hey, what was that look all about?

177
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,327
"Ketorolac. Possible side effects
include swelling of hands and feet,"

178
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,010
"increased appetite, risk of infection..."

179
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,765
Oh. Good, good, good. "Hallucinations."

180
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,361
I really thought I was smarter than this.

181
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,769
You are not me
and you're definitely not real.

182
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,810
I used to be you. Or you used to be me.

183
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,487
Strong, confident, brunette.

184
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,125
But you wasted all that away
to go play super-hero.

185
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,208
And look where that got you.

186
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,680
Okay, so wait, this Waller person said
that she couldn't tell you anything

187
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,325
and then gave you that flash drive?

188
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,881
A.R.G.U.S. has 24/7 internal surveillance.

189
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,526
She didn't want anyone to know
she was giving me what she was giving me.

190
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,882
The question is, what did she give you?

191
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,681
I've seen that symbol before.

192
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,211
<i>It's</i> a <i>logo, actually.</i>

193
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,323
Shadowspire is a US Army
Special Forces unit.

194
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,729
A.R.G.U.S. took them down three years ago
when they were exposed as war profiteers.

195
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,371
In an op run by Alan Chang.

196
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,005
What about those other two guys?

197
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,929
<i>They've been reported missing
for two days.</i>

198
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,361
If those were the missing agents
that were part of Shadowspire...

199
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,882
Then the rest of Shadowspire's
gonna be on a payback mission.

200
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,560
We need to find the other two agents
before they end up like Alan.

201
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,207
Hey, I think I found something.

202
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,562
That logo that was on the flash drive
that Waller gave you.

203
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,727
Shadowspire.

204
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,081
Thought I recognized that from some place.

205
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,770
I ran into a lot of those guys
back in the 'Stan.

206
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,770
I need to talk to my brother again.

207
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,926
You wouldn't think the reward
for confiscating an opium shipment

208
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,929
would be additional duty guarding it.

209
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,407
What'd you expect?
A kiss from the President?

210
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,329
How are my two conquering heroes?

211
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,171
- Wet and tired.
- We are good, sir.

212
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,362
- You gentlemen did good today.
- Thank you, sir.

213
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,642
You ever think of your future
beyond working in this hell hole?

214
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,003
I don't know.
Personal security, body guarding maybe?

215
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,649
You boys are meant for better things.

216
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,841
The three of us could make bank if a few
bricks of that sweet Afghani powder

217
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,771
happened to go AWOL before the morning.

218
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,041
You know, I'm gonna have to decline, sir.

219
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,891
My mama taught me
never to trust dirty war profiteers.

220
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,324
You should probably watch your tone.

221
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,165
You might end up in worse shape
than those Talis yesterday.

222
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,286
As you were.

223
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,407
- Well, look at you.
- What you talking about?

224
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,409
Back in Starling,
you would have jumped at any opportunity

225
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,568
to earn a little extra scratch.

226
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,283
This place has been good for you.
Proud of you, Andy.

227
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,729
So exactly how many evil organizations
are you associated with?

228
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,967
I'm beginning to lose count.

229
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,446
What are you talking about?

230
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,844
Shadowspire. Your old army buddies
are in Starling City.

231
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,366
They tortured and killed an A.R.G.U.S.
agent and abducted two others.

232
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,562
Look, I have nothing to do
with them anymore.

233
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,043
After I get discharged, they cut ties.
They only want enlisted men.

234
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,086
How the hell could I not see this?
You were with me the entire time!

235
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,647
Because you saw what you wanted to see!

236
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,645
Look, you wanted to believe
that the Army had straightened me out.

237
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,929
Look, I'm your brother,
but I'm not built like you.

238
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,009
I didn't take to the military
like you did.

239
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,202
You saw the world
as something to be fixed.

240
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,164
I only saw it as broken.

241
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,170
So I made sure
I had enough to survive in it.

242
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,328
So you pretended to be
a completely different person

243
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,607
around your own brother?

244
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,448
Spare me the look
that's on your face right now.

245
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,525
But maybe some good
could come out of this.

246
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,881
(And)'-

247
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,686
What are you talking about?

248
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,247
Two missing agents.
You still think they're alive?

249
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,647
- I can hope.
- And I can help.

250
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,968
Look, I know how Shadowspire operates.

251
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,881
If they're consistent,

252
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,242
they'll use the nearest free port
as a base of operations.

253
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,525
The best place to hide illicit things
is right next to legitimate ones.

254
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,241
<i>"SPARTAN". It's called a free port.</i>

255
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,364
Holds commodities while they're in transit
between international destinations.

256
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,567
Pretty low-end.

257
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,922
Looks like somebody
upgraded their security system.

258
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,647
Motion sensors, laser trip wires,
digital locks.

259
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,002
I think I know somebody who can help.

260
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,689
Not gonna get that? Smart move.

261
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,767
Oliver?

262
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,764
<i>I'm out in the field, actually.</i>

263
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,360
We've come up against some tech.

264
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,170
The kind that you typically eat
for breakfast.

265
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,603
Now, I know that you said you're not
ready to get back in the saddle,

266
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,450
<i>but we could really use your help.</i>

267
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,887
You're not really falling for that again,
are you?

268
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,167
Where are you?

269
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,205
Pacific Freeport, it's a...

270
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,441
Security's down.

271
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,281
That was amazing.

272
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,289
<i>All you need to do
is to get back in the game.</i>

273
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,966
I thought "vomiting inside my mouth"
was just an expression.

274
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,200
I'm inside their security system.

275
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,687
I got eyes on seven
very menacing-looking fellows

276
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,962
<i>guarding a bunch of holding containers.</i>

277
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,244
Reading infrared in one of the containers.
I'm working on opening that lock.

278
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,323
Go for the hostages.
We'll take care of Shadowspire.

279
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,885
Container's open.
Should be 10 feet in front of you,

280
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,366
second container on your right.

281
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,001
Got it.

282
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,851
We found the two A.R. G. U. S. agents.

283
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,161
They're both dead.

284
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,004
- Get out of here then.
- What about you and Spartan?

285
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,207
We got this! Go!

286
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,841
Felicity, what's going on?

287
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,526
I don't know. l...
I must have tripped some sort of failsafe.

288
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,688
The system's overloaded
with too many requests.

289
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,841
Oopsie.

290
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,365
You hear so much about these vigilantes,
but I've never seen one in person.

291
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,642
Wish I could say the same
about a cold-blooded murderer.

292
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,361
Have we met before?

293
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,321
Let's go.

294
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,403
<i>I've got Spartan. We're good.</i>

295
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,730
No thanks to you.

296
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,801
Hey-

297
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,761
You Okay?

298
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,446
That depends. ls John okay?

299
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,091
John's fine.

300
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,651
But you seem to think that
what happened tonight is your fault.

301
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,445
Well, I'm pretty sure I was the one

302
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,529
who couldn't stop the security doors
from closing.

303
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,921
And I'm the one who pushed you
to get involved

304
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,287
when you signaled pretty hard
that you weren't ready.

305
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,084
I wasn't signaling

306
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,281
that hard.

307
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,444
I'm sorry that I pushed.

308
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,446
I just thought
that if you got behind a keyboard again,

309
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,171
that things would just start
to feel normal.

310
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,966
I love how playing super-hero
is what we consider normal.

311
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,286
Yeah.

312
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,968
But there is no going back to normal.

313
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,487
- You know what I mean.
- I know what you mean.

314
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,967
What I mean is that
I can no longer be a part of the team.

315
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,851
Because of your injury?
You can't let that stop you.

316
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,644
Except it has.

317
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,123
Look at me, Oliver.

318
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,324
I've spent the last week and a half
stuck in this loft.

319
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,970
I can't move, I can't drive, I can't walk
down the street and get a cup of coffee.

320
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,970
And if tonight is any indication,

321
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,488
I can't do the one thing
that I'm supposed to still be able to do.

322
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,801
You just need to give it time.

323
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,006
Hey, talk to me.

324
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,847
Go ahead, tell him.

325
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,840
Tell him you're hallucinating.
That should go over like gangbusters.

326
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,764
I'm not going to pretend
that I understand...

327
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,161
Come on, Felicity, tell him.

328
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,327
<i>What you're going through.</i>

329
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,927
Tell him that you're no good
for the team anymore.

330
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,003
That in addition
to having legs that don't work,

331
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,162
you've got a full on case of the crazies.

332
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,165
<i>- We don't stand</i> a chance to <i>take down...
- Hearing voices, seeing visions...</i>

333
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,850
Would you just shut up!

334
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,284
- I didn't mean that.
- I didn't mean to upset you.

335
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,851
No, no, no, it's not you, it's not you.

336
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,043
Can I just be alone for a little while?

337
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,364
You know, I guessed I hoped
by giving you intel on Shadowspire,

338
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,727
you would let me out of my cell.

339
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,882
But this isn't what I had in mind.

340
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,964
Hey, Lyla. It's been a while.

341
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,201
(And)'-

342
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,046
Mr. Diggle. I'm the director of A.R.G.U.S.

343
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,770
Those three dead men were my agents.

344
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,043
I wanna debrief you
on your relationship to Shadowspire.

345
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,247
Which is interesting

346
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,442
because you couldn't even
say "Shadowspire" last time we met.

347
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,884
I was taking an understandable precaution
in light of a potential security breach.

348
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,967
The two agents you found tonight
were assigned

349
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,561
to safeguard a shipment
of confiscated railguns.

350
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,249
But that was a completely
black assignment.

351
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,128
So I'd be very interested to know
how Shadowspire knew about it.

352
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,762
Amanda, you don't see
the bigger problem here?

353
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,241
Those things fire off
electromagnetic projectiles.

354
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,970
Just one of them
could take down a building.

355
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,127
Your point?

356
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,846
My point is that if Shadowspire's
looking for that type of ordnance...

357
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,765
I'm far more concerned
with a catastrophic security breach

358
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,763
in my organization, Mr. Diggle.

359
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,286
<i>"ANDY". It doesn't matter.</i>

360
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,930
Shadowspire's not after railguns.

361
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,281
And what if you're wrong, Andy?

362
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,442
We thought you weren't hooked up
with Shadowspire anymore.

363
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,007
I'm not. But I know the way they work.

364
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,601
Shadowspire is all about misdirection.

365
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,370
An elite military unit?

366
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,170
A cover for a criminal organization.

367
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,806
A heist of a shipment of railguns?

368
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,285
No. Distraction.

369
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,124
They're after something else.

370
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,121
You wanna talk about it?

371
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,486
What is there to talk about?

372
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,723
Felicity's upset,
I don't know how to help her,

373
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,327
it seems entirely straightforward.

374
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,247
As the only other person here
who's had the privilege of dating you,

375
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,481
a piece of advice?

376
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,011
Okay.

377
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,011
Don't be so hard on yourself.

378
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,009
Everything that's happening is my fault.

379
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,685
I knew you were gonna say that.

380
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,561
Last month, when we went up
against Vandal Savage,

381
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,525
Barry traveled through time
and changed things.

382
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,842
- What?
- Barry can travel through time.

383
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,607
And he warned me
that when you change the past,

384
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,001
the past fights back.

385
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:57,166
So for the past month,
I have been tortured by the idea

386
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,682
that what happened to Felicity
might have happened

387
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,841
because I wouldn't listen to him.

388
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,681
The only person who is responsible
for what happened to Felicity

389
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,921
is Damien Darhk.

390
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,930
John. We're on it.

391
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,971
John thinks Shadowspire's going after
a shipment of railguns.

392
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,043
- Can you call Thea?
- Got it.

393
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,041
Hey, Oliver.

394
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,200
Felicity, she makes her own choices,
you know.

395
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,727
And I'm sure that's one of the reasons
why you love her so much.

396
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,924
<i>Wow. The Shining.</i>

397
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,602
Not sure if I should be flattered,
or insulted.

398
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,168
Oh, my God! God, just go away already.

399
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,401
Since I'm you,

400
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,404
that could be a little difficult,
don't you think?

401
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,089
Fine. I'm here. You're here.
So why are we here?

402
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,083
Do you have anything
the least bit interesting to say to me

403
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,651
besides these little jabs you keep making?

404
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,241
Well, those jabs
were just to get your attention.

405
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,771
So what do you wanna tell me?

406
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,607
I'm not here to tell you anything.
I'm here to show you.

407
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,764
The last time we looked like this,
Cooper had just fake died.

408
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,485
What does this have to do
with my ex-boyfriend?

409
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,603
The day we thought he died,

410
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,927
you broke out the hair dye,
ditched the contacts and decided

411
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,526
you weren't gonna rely on anyone else
for help ever again.

412
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,762
It was just going to be you
against the world,

413
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,763
and that was going to be your armor.

414
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,530
Guess I should've chosen Kevlar.

415
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,367
Stop it. Stop feeling sorry for yourself!
And stop pretending!

416
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,127
- Pretending?
- Pretending that this is the real you.

417
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,609
The blonde hair, glasses,
sensible fashion.

418
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,963
People wear masks for a reason.
To hide who they are.

419
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,640
Just like you have been doing
for the past five years.

420
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,646
First you decided to sign up for being
the world's most overqualified IT girl,

421
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,644
and then you decide to try being a hero.

422
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,481
And look what it got you.

423
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,642
<i>A ringside seat to the rest of your life.</i>

424
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,970
You thought you were such a badass.

425
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,890
So Waller says the shipment of railguns
is in the back of that truck.

426
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,844
Moving out in less than an hour.

427
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,243
What does Shadowspire want
with a whole shipment of railguns?

428
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,889
Absolutely nothing good.

429
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,686
It's nice to have you back,
Agent Michaels.

430
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,205
Feels like old times.

431
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,686
What feels like old times

432
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,525
is you keeping secrets
that get good people killed.

433
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,843
Did it ever occur to you that Alan and
the other two agents might still be alive

434
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,362
if you hadn't tried to keep your
anti-Shadowspire operations off the books?

435
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,005
Of course it has.

436
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,289
But the ugly side of our business
is that sometimes

437
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,363
security has to be paid for in blood.

438
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,446
Thank you. I was wondering why I'd left.

439
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,531
I don't know
what you're worried about, man.

440
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,091
Your team's not seeing action tonight.

441
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,726
Yeah, and I'm not with them
because I'm here babysitting you.

442
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,961
Where are they?

443
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,967
Something's wrong.

444
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,880
There's no movement on the railgun...

445
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,721
Put your hands up! On your head now!

446
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,007
Don't do it!

447
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,650
Amanda. It's been ages.

448
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,129
Lieutenant Joyner.
Wish I could say it was a pleasure.

449
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,966
C'mon, man, stop moving.
You are making me dizzy.

450
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,921
Oh, my God.

451
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,281
I told you, John.

452
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,161
The railguns were a distraction.

453
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,203
A.R.G.U.S. is the endgame.

454
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,686
If this is retribution for the work Agent
Chang and I did crippling Shadowspire,

455
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,450
clearly it didn't take.

456
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,805
Vengeance and retribution
are useless pursuits.

457
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,207
For one thing, they don't pay.

458
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,131
I'm here for Rubicon.

459
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,281
And you, you're gonna give me
the codes to access it.

460
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,646
You know I can't do that.

461
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,281
I do.
That's why I kept all these people alive.

462
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,040
(%GUNSHOTS) %GROANS)

463
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,370
I'm gonna give you 20 minutes.

464
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,201
And then,

465
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,810
I'm gonna ask you again.

466
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,486
Damn it. They must havejammers in here.
No cell or Wi-Fi service.

467
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,164
Uh, would you like to share
with the rest of the class?

468
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,767
These monitors work just like TVs.

469
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,322
Receiving broadcast signals
from the 700 MHz band.

470
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,050
I have a friend who's into
this kind of stuff.

471
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,605
Occasionally, I listen to her.

472
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,164
If I can just switch the chipset
into transmitting mode,

473
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,364
I should be able to contact my team.

474
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,007
Oh, man, Lyla does not have time to wait
on your team. We've gotta do something.

475
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,685
Yeah, well,
you're not doing anything, Andy.

476
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,208
Look, man, your wife is in there!
Now is not the time to not trust me!

477
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,124
Come on, come on, come on.

478
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,246
Son of a bitch.

479
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,767
Hey-

480
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,530
What, you just putting on
a little show for me, huh?

481
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,205
Get your hands off of me, man.
What's wrong with you?

482
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,203
I see you buddying it up with Joyner.

483
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,885
Talking to him thick as thieves.

484
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,566
Would you relax?
We were talking about blackjack.

485
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,967
I was telling him about the card counting
technique you taught me.

486
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,089
- Really, Andy?
- Yeah, really.

487
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,481
Okay, man.

488
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,402
'Cause I can't have you backsliding,
all right?

489
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,410
Man, I agreed to go through
this whole army thing.

490
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,565
And I kept my end of the bargain.
Now I need you to keep yours.

491
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,642
And I need you to start treating me
like a brother and not like a criminal.

492
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,241
Okay.

493
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,721
I'm sorry.

494
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,721
You're right.

495
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,081
John, Shadowspire never made a move
on the shipment,

496
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,921
so whatever their next move is, it...
It's not railguns.

497
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,083
Just call me when you get something
new from your brother. All right.

498
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,681
Oh.

499
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,084
I am so glad
our new lair has elevator access.

500
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,287
Hi.

501
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,444
Curtis has anointed himself
my personal chauffeur.

502
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,086
Fancy. It's a good thing
he didn't ask too many questions

503
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,124
about coming to your campaign office
in the middle of the night.

504
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,049
What are you doing here?

505
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,206
Well, I was at home

506
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,288
feeling more self-pity than I have
in my entire life when it hit me.

507
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,200
This is who I am.

508
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,124
I wanted to come along
on your awesome superhero adventure

509
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,123
because I wanted to help people.

510
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,525
And the old me was so angry at the world.

511
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,127
That anger never accomplished anything,
it just created more anger.

512
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,842
And some seriously bad
personal style choices.

513
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,486
I wanted to do some good in the world.

514
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,210
- Ow.
- That was a good speech.

515
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,323
Thought you'd be a little more impressed.

516
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,847
It was a good speech. But...

517
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,327
But... How did it go again?

518
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,847
I know you, and I do,

519
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,042
you're probably thinking
what happened was your fault.

520
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,209
I'm here to tell you that it's not.

521
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,208
And that it's not mine either.

522
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,771
It's the fault of only one man

523
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,526
and he has an extremely on-the-nose
and alliterative name.

524
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,727
And we're going to stop him.

525
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,881
Not out of guilt or vengeance or regret.

526
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,368
We are going to stop him
because it's what we do.

527
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,730
It's who we are.

528
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,089
- That was a good speech.
- Yeah?

529
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,523
I'm very happy to hear it.

530
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,408
We're gonna need to get some ramps.

531
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:00,122
A.R.G.U.S. has been compromised.
And Lyla's being held hostage.

532
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,924
Found this in your office.
Hope you don't mind.

533
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,401
Lieutenant, we've picked up
an unauthorized comm

534
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,085
out of the detention area.

535
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,731
Take someone and look into it.

536
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,410
Yes, sir.

537
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,245
Go on.

538
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,605
You might not get the chance
to enjoy it again.

539
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,968
It's been 20 minutes.

540
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,803
I'm gonna have to downsize
your organization yet again?

541
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,161
Apparently.

542
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,448
Well, that's rather cold blooded.

543
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,600
You really don't know her
that well at all, do you?

544
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,921
Ms. Michaels was one
of my most trusted agents.

545
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,840
She knows better than anyone
that I'm perfectly capable

546
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,607
of watching you execute
every person in this room,

547
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,531
and I'll still never give you
the Rubicon access codes.

548
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,964
Is that right, Ms. Michaels?

549
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,602
It's right. It's Why I left.

550
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,966
Amanda Waller doesn't make decisions
based on the value of human life.

551
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,006
Pity.

552
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,327
No!

553
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,887
Well, Ms. Michaels, most trusted agent,

554
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,528
looks like you now have 20 minutes.

555
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,051
John.

556
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,161
My God, no.

557
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,330
Wait, wait a minute. John. John. John.

558
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,168
John, please! He's going to kill her.
You can't afford not to trust me.

559
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,321
- Overwatch, we're onsite.
- Excuse me?

560
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,404
Well, I thought that it was time
you got a codename. What do you think?

561
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,681
It's perfect.

562
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,729
I was gonna go with Oracle,
but it's taken.

563
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,685
Shadowspire's got the entire area
around C-and-C in lockdown.

564
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,444
<i>You guys are the only game in town.</i>

565
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,205
Can you get us inside?

566
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,889
Like that, you mean?

567
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,090
Well, it's about time
you guys came looking.

568
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,281
Who the hell are you supposed to be?

569
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,126
Sergeant Andrew Diggle,
52nd Regiment, 5th Battalion.

570
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,362
- What are you doing locked up here?
- It's a long story.

571
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,369
Shorter version being my brother's a jerk.

572
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,287
Lucky for me, though,
your CO and I go way back.

573
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,520
If you're serious about Lyla Michaels
giving up the Rubicon codes,

574
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,121
you will get on the radio
and tell Lieutenant Joyner

575
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,729
the guy that taught him how to count cards
is here and wants to help him out.

576
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,291
Andy Diggle.
You look pretty good for a dead man.

577
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,050
And here, I thought I'd put on weight.

578
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,606
What are you doing at A.R.G.U.S.,
much less alive?

579
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,486
Amanda Waller brought me in because
of my former association with you guys,

580
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,081
but, small world, though.

581
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,084
Your friend, Ms. Michaels?
She's my sister-in-law.

582
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,241
- Andy...
- Point being,

583
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,563
her husband is crawling around
these ventilation shafts right now.

584
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,166
If you put a gun on him,
she'll tell you whatever you need to know.

585
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,401
You son of a...

586
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,083
Turning on your own brother,
that's ice cold.

587
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,762
Now, you know better than most.
John and I never saw eye to eye.

588
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,086
Gentlemen, check the facility's
ventilation shafts.

589
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,601
Overwatch?

590
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,603
<i>C-and-C three floors down.
Northeast corner.</i>

591
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,524
That'll give us a few minutes.

592
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,485
The other Diggle brother.
Isn't this quaint?

593
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,490
I get out of these cuffs and you'll see
how quaint you think I can be.

594
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,642
It's a shame you can't be
more like the little Diggle.

595
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,851
<i>His pragmatism has proven to be
quite the asset.</i>

596
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,644
Now, if your brother's right,

597
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,886
you should be able to convince your wife
to give me what I want.

598
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,641
Johnnie, if Rubicon ever got out
in the open...

599
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,007
Ms. Michaels, in five seconds,

600
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,164
it's your husband's brains
that will be out in the open.

601
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,484
Four, three, two...

602
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,040
Do it. Do it, Lyla.

603
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,411
It's all right.

604
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,681
Excellent.

605
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,887
If you've run out of guys to punch,
Spartan needs an assist.

606
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,844
<i>Two assists, actually.</i>

607
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,087
Tell us what to do.

608
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,364
Shadowspire's getting the access codes
for a secure vault in the sub-level.

609
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,885
I'm trying to stop the codes from working,

610
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,249
but I'm going to need Canary and Speedy
as my insurance policies.

611
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,041
Where do you want me?

612
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,045
This is taking too long.

613
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,770
Something's wrong.
Someone's locking me out of the system.

614
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:35,444
Go away. I'm not you anymore.
I haven't been for a long time.

615
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,649
I can't get in. I have all the right codes

616
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,884
but someone on the outside is preventing
me from entering the sub-level vault.

617
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,324
That's extremely unfortunate.

618
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,204
- You okay?
- Yeah.

619
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,282
- You okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

620
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,960
Good job.

621
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,485
Yeah, it was like you said,

622
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,801
it was the only way
to get us both in here.

623
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,165
Just remember whose idea this was.

624
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,323
What were you expecting,
a kiss from the President?

625
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,485
To Amanda Waller.

626
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,207
To Amanda Waller.

627
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,407
You remember that time that she tried
to take down the city with a drone strike?

628
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,240
Good times.

629
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,164
Hey, thanks for the assist tonight.

630
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,368
I was just glad to be useful.

631
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,569
Good job jury-rigging
the security system, though.

632
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,603
Just trying to make you proud, Felicity.

633
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,887
You did.

634
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,923
What are you gonna do about Andy?

635
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,604
Still haven't made a decision on that.

636
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,525
You mean even though
he just saved your life?

637
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,690
Yeah, well, you guys had a whole lot
to do with that.

638
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,690
But, you're right,
this is the first time in eight years

639
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,450
I've seen shades of my old brother.

640
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,531
You wanted to see me, sir?

641
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,767
I already got my cut.

642
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,123
Yeah, it's a token of appreciation
from the boss.

643
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,647
He traded the opium for something else.

644
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,881
Like what?

645
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,045
Ask him yourself.

646
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,402
Thank you for your assistance, Mr. Diggle.

647
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,769
Lieutenant Joyner sings your praises.

648
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,088
Happy to help.
What did you get for the opium?

649
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,483
Legend speaks
of a place of immeasurable power.

650
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,882
Many have disappeared searching for it.

651
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:36,290
So much so that the locals
simply refer to it by one word.

652
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,245
Purgatory.

653
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,088
I thought we were totally unpacked.

654
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,765
Just humor me.

655
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,765
What am I getting?

656
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,964
Uh, yes, that white box. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

657
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,761
You ready?

658
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,928
Wow!

659
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,924
When you said that you made
some bad personal style choices,

660
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,167
you weren't kidding.

661
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,204
This is the old me.

662
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,922
A rebellious, brunette hacker who didn't
listen to anyone else's rules but her own.

663
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,645
You're not that person anymore?

664
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,126
Nope.

665
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,603
What you did last night was amazing.

666
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,440
I was really badass.

667
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,761
Yeah.

668
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,122
Though the old me probably would have
stolen the plans for Rubicon

669
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,163
and released them
as some sort of political statement.

670
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,964
The old me
would have snapped Joyner's neck.

671
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,441
Yeah.

672
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,125
We've both grown.

673
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,202
Thank you for always being on my side.

674
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,965
No place I'd rather be.

675
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,525
Hand me that garbage can and this lighter.

676
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,402
How much medication are you on?

677
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,881
Absolutely none.

678
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,321
Okay.

679
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,246
I just wanna make sure
that my past stays the past, you know?

680
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,731
Goodbye.

681
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,163
- One more thing from me.
- What?

682
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,886
The doctor said
your condition is permanent.

683
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,322
And I don't think that it's healthy

684
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:22,527
or productive for either of us
to live in denial.

685
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,442
But I have seen people speed
and shrink and fly.

686
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,531
We watched a friend of ours
come back from the dead.

687
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,202
That is the world that we live in now.

688
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,122
And I will not stop searching it

689
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,047
until we find a way
to make you walk again.

690
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,126
Hey-

691
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,884
Are you sure about this? 'Cause I'm not.

692
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,724
Better than being in that cage, right?

693
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,042
You might wanna wait outside,
I have it from here.

694
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,564
Make yourself comfortable.
Lyla's cooking something.

695
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,201
Hey-

696
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,727
If this is about reconnecting
with Carly and Andy as well, I, urn...

697
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,247
I get it, Andy. Step by step, right?

698
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,164
AndY-_HY-

699
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,562
I'm making pork roast.
Johnnie said it's your favorite.

700
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,085
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

701
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,811
We've got another surprise for you, man.
Just a second.

702
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,924
- Hey, Lyla, I...
- Not a word.

703
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,248
John and I both agreed to this.
She's excited to meet you.

704
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,411
This is your niece.

705
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,601
Hey-

706
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,922
Sara. And that's your uncle Andy.

707
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,607
Yeah.

708
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,610
She's got Mom's eyes.

709
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,445
Welcome home, man.

710
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,761
