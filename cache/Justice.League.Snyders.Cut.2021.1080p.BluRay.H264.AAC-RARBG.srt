1
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,575
Alert the queen.

2
00:06:29,492 --> 00:06:30,575
Hyah!

3
00:09:00,117 --> 00:09:03,200
Bruce Vayne.

4
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,950
Bruce Wayne.

5
00:09:22,783 --> 00:09:24,367
Talk.

6
00:09:25,492 --> 00:09:27,325
I believe there is a stranger.

7
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:30,075
Comes to this village
from the sea.

8
00:09:30,075 --> 00:09:33,158
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry.

9
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:35,492
He brings fish.

10
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,283
He comes on the king tide.

11
00:09:37,283 --> 00:09:38,800
That was last night.

12
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:47,575
You have eyes, so see.

13
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:49,367
Icebergs in the harbor.

14
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:52,533
It's four months since
the last ship got through.

15
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:56,867
Well, this stranger
doesn't come by ship.

16
00:10:03,492 --> 00:10:07,450
There are enemies
coming from far away.

17
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:10,367
I need warriors.

18
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:13,992
This stranger,
others like him.

19
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:18,450
I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.

20
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,658
It's very important
that I see this man.

21
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:25,117
If this stranger exists,

22
00:10:25,117 --> 00:10:27,408
he'll give him your message.

23
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:28,700
$5,000 American.

24
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,533
Look, I'll give you $25,000

25
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:33,617
to talk to this man
right now, outside.

26
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:50,700
How dare this dog
speak to us like children.

27
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,533
Ooh, magical man from the sea.

28
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:57,617
We are poor, not stupid.

29
00:10:57,617 --> 00:10:59,408
Get out.

30
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:02,075
I'm sorry.

31
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:03,867
Can't do that.

32
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:06,158
I'll leave after we've spoken.

33
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:12,325
He said, "Get out."

34
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:33,158
Arthur Curry.

35
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:36,742
Also known as
Protector of the Oceans.

36
00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:38,492
The Aquaman.

37
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,783
So, let me
get this straight.

38
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:49,575
You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?

39
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,450
Worked for 20 years in Gotham.

40
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,367
Oh, that shithole.

41
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:55,325
When the fight comes,
we'll need you.

42
00:11:55,325 --> 00:11:57,908
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

43
00:11:57,908 --> 00:11:59,950
'Cause I don't like you coming
here, digging into my business

44
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,783
and getting into my life.
I want to be left alone.

45
00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:04,000
Is that why you do this?

46
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,200
Why you help these people out
here in the middle of nowhere?

47
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,330
I've read the stories.

48
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,867
Your good deeds
you think no one sees.

49
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,408
You'll join us.

50
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:13,325
"Strong man
is strongest alone."

51
00:12:13,325 --> 00:12:14,950
You ever heard that?

52
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,575
You ever hear
of Superman?

53
00:12:16,575 --> 00:12:18,283
He died fighting next to me.

54
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:20,950
My point exactly.

55
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,367
He believed
we were stronger together.

56
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,075
We owe it to him.

57
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:27,533
I don't owe anyone anything.

58
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:37,700
Dressed like a bat.

59
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,783
You're out of your mind,
Bruce Wayne.

60
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,533
Move over, Dusty.

61
00:15:05,158 --> 00:15:08,367
My God, Master Wayne,
but this is cold.

62
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:12,908
Maybe we can catch
the next king tide in Jamaica?

63
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:15,450
Might be
a metahuman or two in Fiji.

64
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,283
Costa Rica's nice.

65
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,825
I found him.

66
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:23,908
He said no.

67
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:26,242
So, the draft stands
at naught for two?

68
00:15:28,408 --> 00:15:31,367
Maybe a man who broods
in a cave for a living

69
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:35,075
isn't cut out to be
a recruiter. Hmm?

70
00:15:54,617 --> 00:15:56,533
That's $10, please.

71
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,742
Good morning, Miss Lane.

72
00:16:35,742 --> 00:16:37,220
Jerry, hi.

73
00:16:37,992 --> 00:16:39,908
Wow.

74
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:41,660
You don't miss a day, do you?

75
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,742
Like it here.

76
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:31,200
Excuse me.

77
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:33,908
Move!

78
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,283
Move it! Move it!

79
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:55,117
- No, mate, don't shoot!
- Move, move!

80
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:56,825
Get the fuck
over there!

81
00:18:58,742 --> 00:19:00,367
Move! All of ya!

82
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:12,992
Line them up
along the wall.

83
00:19:12,992 --> 00:19:14,880
Keep them quiet.

84
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,325
- Keep quiet!
- Shut up! Shut up!

85
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,825
Shut them up too!

86
00:19:22,658 --> 00:19:25,408
We'll be making
a statement shortly.

87
00:19:25,408 --> 00:19:27,367
Until then,
if I see any movement,

88
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,617
you'll have a lot of dead kids
on your hands.

89
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,158
Should I take him?

90
00:19:46,158 --> 00:19:47,950
Hold your fire.

91
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:50,990
They've got kids in there.

92
00:19:52,283 --> 00:19:54,200
Yeah, he's not bluffing, chief.

93
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,617
St. Brigid's had
a school trip today.

94
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:22,880
Quiet! Shut up!

95
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,950
Down with the modern world.

96
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,617
Back to the Dark Ages.

97
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,075
Quiet!

98
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:42,742
I said
shut your fucking mouth.

99
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,533
Who are you?

100
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:02,283
The Lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

101
00:21:02,283 --> 00:21:04,283
Now, who are you?

102
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:07,450
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists

103
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,242
who wanna turn back
the clock in Europe

104
00:21:09,242 --> 00:21:11,783
- a thousand years.
- Boring. Why the hostages?

105
00:21:11,783 --> 00:21:13,408
We have no demands.

106
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:15,283
We're just stalling the police
while we do it.

107
00:21:15,283 --> 00:21:16,825
While you do what?

108
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:21,033
You're too late.
The countdown's already begun.

109
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:24,575
In a few minutes,
four city blocks…

110
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,825
…while the world watches.

111
00:23:08,617 --> 00:23:09,110
No!

112
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,742
Like lambs
to the slaughter.

113
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,533
I don't believe it.

114
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,110
Believe it.

115
00:24:39,075 --> 00:24:42,200
Is everyone all right?
Are you okay?

116
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,408
Good.
It's okay.

117
00:24:44,408 --> 00:24:46,783
It's okay. It's over.
You can stand up.

118
00:24:46,783 --> 00:24:48,158
It's all good.

119
00:24:48,158 --> 00:24:50,158
It's over now.
Are you okay?

120
00:24:50,158 --> 00:24:52,450
You okay?
Good.

121
00:24:57,992 --> 00:24:59,880
Are you okay, princess?

122
00:25:02,742 --> 00:25:04,658
Can I be like you someday?

123
00:25:06,617 --> 00:25:09,450
You can be anything
you want to be.

124
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,700
Come on.
Let's go.

125
00:25:56,408 --> 00:25:57,700
Any changes today?

126
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,367
No, my Queen.

127
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:02,992
The Mother Box has awoken,

128
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:05,992
yet nothing has happened.

129
00:26:05,992 --> 00:26:08,283
It has slept
for thousands of years

130
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:10,408
since the First Age.

131
00:26:10,408 --> 00:26:12,220
Why did it wake at all?

132
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:21,617
This is the first time
it's gone quiet

133
00:26:21,617 --> 00:26:22,950
since the crack appeared.

134
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,783
Maybe it's going
back to sleep.

135
00:26:29,783 --> 00:26:31,617
Evil does not sleep.

136
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,408
It waits.

137
00:26:35,783 --> 00:26:37,867
Something is coming.

138
00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:44,880
Prepare for battle!

139
00:27:10,325 --> 00:27:12,825
Amazons,
on your marks!

140
00:27:12,825 --> 00:27:14,200
Ready!

141
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,408
Defenders.

142
00:27:42,825 --> 00:27:47,742
They have failed
100,000 worlds.

143
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:49,770
They always fail.

144
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:55,992
I've come to enlighten you
to the great darkness.

145
00:27:55,992 --> 00:27:59,033
I will bathe in your fear.

146
00:28:00,408 --> 00:28:03,033
Daughters of Themyscira,

147
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,950
show him your fear!

148
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,492
We have no fear!

149
00:28:27,658 --> 00:28:29,408
Gather the legions!

150
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:31,533
Go with her!

151
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:33,033
You must seal the cage!

152
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:35,367
- Go!
- Phillipus!

153
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:03,660
No!

154
00:29:15,742 --> 00:29:16,908
Behind you!

155
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:25,492
Epione.

156
00:29:27,283 --> 00:29:29,450
Honor us.
It's right.

157
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:33,742
Seal it.

158
00:29:38,908 --> 00:29:41,450
Ready the hammers!

159
00:29:53,783 --> 00:29:55,950
Seal it now!

160
00:31:30,242 --> 00:31:31,950
Guard it with your life.

161
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,825
- Yes, my Queen.
- Keep it moving.

162
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,617
Got it! Go!

163
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:49,220
Oh, noble Queen.
Why do you fight?

164
00:34:51,617 --> 00:34:53,492
You can't save her.

165
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:56,158
You can't save any of them.

166
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:03,617
The great darkness begins.

167
00:35:03,617 --> 00:35:05,492
Amazons!

168
00:35:15,617 --> 00:35:18,408
Yes, we will find the others.

169
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:22,783
Draw!

170
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,990
Loose!

171
00:36:24,033 --> 00:36:26,200
He's gone back
to his universe.

172
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,325
No.

173
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,242
He's gone to the lands of men

174
00:36:32,242 --> 00:36:35,533
to find the other two boxes.

175
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:38,742
We have to light
the ancient warning fire.

176
00:36:38,742 --> 00:36:42,408
The fire has not burned
for 5,000 years.

177
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,867
Men won't know what it means.

178
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:46,408
Men won't.

179
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:49,575
She will.

180
00:37:20,158 --> 00:37:22,950
It's toxic.

181
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,783
That's good.

182
00:37:45,658 --> 00:37:46,867
Go!

183
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:49,117
Follow the scent
of the Mother Boxes.

184
00:37:49,117 --> 00:37:50,700
Find the missing two.

185
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,783
Once they are found,
The Unity will be formed.

186
00:37:54,783 --> 00:37:57,783
This world
will join the others.

187
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:01,658
He will be pleased.

188
00:38:01,658 --> 00:38:04,783
He will see my worth again.

189
00:38:07,325 --> 00:38:09,158
Hey.

190
00:38:09,158 --> 00:38:11,992
Anything on that kid
from the liquor store?

191
00:38:11,992 --> 00:38:14,242
Possibly.

192
00:38:14,242 --> 00:38:16,492
"Possibly."

193
00:38:16,492 --> 00:38:19,158
If I had a dollar
for every "possibly."

194
00:38:19,158 --> 00:38:22,075
Yeah, it would make you
even more insufferable.

195
00:38:24,783 --> 00:38:27,742
Facial scan might have
got a hit on him,

196
00:38:27,742 --> 00:38:30,117
our disappearing man.

197
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:35,033
One Mr. Barry Allen
from Central City.

198
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:36,492
Might be another
false positive,

199
00:38:36,492 --> 00:38:38,033
you'll have to give me
a little time

200
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:40,533
- to confirm.
- We don't have any more time.

201
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,867
Master Wayne,

202
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:46,450
you've been working
as if there's no tomorrow

203
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,658
to build this team

204
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,880
of people you can't even find.

205
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,220
I found one.
I found two, including Diana.

206
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,700
Just because Lex Luthor says

207
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,033
the planet's
in danger of attack?

208
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,283
This has nothing
to do with Lex Luthor.

209
00:38:58,283 --> 00:38:59,700
It has to do with him.

210
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,867
I made a promise to him
on his grave.

211
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:07,117
I spent a lot of time
trying to divide us.

212
00:39:07,117 --> 00:39:10,700
I need to bring us together
and make this right.

213
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,533
Well, it's been some time
since Luthor's warning.

214
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:17,950
No attacks.
No barbarians at the gate.

215
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:21,533
Maybe these barbarians
don't use a gate.

216
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:23,660
Maybe they're already here.

217
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:29,075
Keep looking.
What else do you have?

218
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,700
Lab's all yours, Howard.

219
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,408
11:30.

220
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:12,950
Early night for you, Silas.

221
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,658
Yes, early night.

222
00:40:15,658 --> 00:40:17,330
Tell your family I said hello.

223
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,908
What the…

224
00:40:57,783 --> 00:40:59,220
Jesus.

225
00:42:12,075 --> 00:42:14,950
The Arrow of Artemis.

226
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,990
It will reach
the lands of men.

227
00:42:27,242 --> 00:42:28,700
Sky torch,

228
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,408
hero beacon,

229
00:42:30,408 --> 00:42:32,158
scatter the darkness.

230
00:42:32,158 --> 00:42:35,658
Burn as you burned
in days before.

231
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:40,992
Show her the darkness
before the daylight of history.

232
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:44,783
Warn my daughter
that war has come

233
00:42:46,075 --> 00:42:47,867
and protect her.

234
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,908
Return to me, Diana.

235
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,325
<i>What did you do
this weekend, Diana?</i>

236
00:43:56,325 --> 00:43:58,658
Nothing very interesting.

237
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,220
That's all you ever tell us.

238
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,867
What can I do?
I'm not that exciting.

239
00:44:04,867 --> 00:44:09,075
You might as well disappear
when you walk out of here.

240
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:14,492
Again?

241
00:44:14,492 --> 00:44:16,783
- What is it?
- Now what?

242
00:44:16,783 --> 00:44:20,075
Budget cuts, tomb raiders.

243
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:22,742
Now add to the list "arson".

244
00:44:24,367 --> 00:44:25,550
<i>Yes, good morning</i>

245
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,220
<i>from the isle of Crete.</i>

246
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,000
<i>As you can see behind me,</i>

247
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,867
<i>an enormous bonfire
is burning.</i>

248
00:44:31,867 --> 00:44:34,242
<i>This fire has been burning
through the night.</i>

249
00:44:34,242 --> 00:44:35,700
<i>We're now into the morning</i>

250
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,075
<i>and we are
at least five miles away.</i>

251
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:41,533
<i>And we can still
see it burning as we speak.</i>

252
00:44:41,533 --> 00:44:44,908
<i>This has baffled locals and
government authorities alike</i>

253
00:44:44,908 --> 00:44:46,825
<i>here at this historical site</i>

254
00:44:46,825 --> 00:44:49,408
<i>of the so-called shrine
of the Amazons.</i>

255
00:44:49,408 --> 00:44:51,408
<i>Now, locals and government
officials are baffled as to</i>

256
00:44:51,408 --> 00:44:53,700
- <i>what may have caused this.</i>
- Invasion.

257
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:03,867
Ryan.

258
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,367
- Hiya, Doc.
- Is the…

259
00:45:05,367 --> 00:45:07,575
No damage
to the electron-laser.

260
00:45:07,575 --> 00:45:09,742
- Uh, Dr. Silas Stone?
- Yeah.

261
00:45:09,742 --> 00:45:11,700
- Ryan Choi?
- That's us.

262
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,158
Um, who did this?
Did they steal anything?

263
00:45:14,158 --> 00:45:15,825
They took
whatever was in here.

264
00:45:15,825 --> 00:45:19,783
That? Oh, that wasn't stolen.
Was it, Dr. Stone?

265
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,658
No. That was misplaced
a while ago.

266
00:45:22,658 --> 00:45:26,658
Object 6-1-9-8-2. Department
of Defense Archives.

267
00:45:26,658 --> 00:45:29,033
- Mmm-hmm.
- What was it?

268
00:45:29,033 --> 00:45:30,075
I don't know.

269
00:45:30,075 --> 00:45:31,220
You don't know?

270
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,575
I don't know, which was why
I was studying it.

271
00:45:33,575 --> 00:45:35,408
What's your rank, Doctor?

272
00:45:35,408 --> 00:45:37,658
Ryan, would you, uh,
do the honors?

273
00:45:37,658 --> 00:45:39,325
- Sure. Okay.
- Thanks.

274
00:45:39,325 --> 00:45:41,908
Civilian. STARLABS
is a private contractor.

275
00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:43,158
We work for the DoD.

276
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:46,200
We advise them
on xeno-science.

277
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,867
"Xeno-science"?

278
00:45:47,867 --> 00:45:49,825
Alien technology.

279
00:45:56,825 --> 00:45:59,075
For example,

280
00:45:59,075 --> 00:46:00,742
the Superman ship.

281
00:46:08,908 --> 00:46:09,600
Eight people

282
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,158
never signed out
of the lab last night, Doctor.

283
00:46:12,158 --> 00:46:13,450
Cleaning staff, guards,

284
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,617
a few of
your research scientists.

285
00:46:15,617 --> 00:46:17,992
They were abducted.

286
00:46:17,992 --> 00:46:19,158
Are you sure?

287
00:46:19,158 --> 00:46:21,700
Witness saw it all.
He escaped.

288
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:25,117
He's here in quarantine now,
working on an ID sketch.

289
00:46:27,867 --> 00:46:32,492
Any idea who
or what that might be?

290
00:46:52,408 --> 00:46:54,617
The box
isn't safe here.

291
00:46:57,033 --> 00:46:58,575
Victor,

292
00:46:58,575 --> 00:47:00,950
they came looking for it
at the lab.

293
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:05,990
People were taken by some kind
of monster or something.

294
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,867
You know a lot about monsters,

295
00:47:10,867 --> 00:47:12,450
don't you?

296
00:47:18,658 --> 00:47:21,450
Especially, how to make 'em.

297
00:50:21,367 --> 00:50:25,158
Mayday!
Mayday, mayday!

298
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,075
My hull is breached.
I'm going down.

299
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:37,367
Mayday!

300
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,575
Is there anybody out there?

301
00:51:19,825 --> 00:51:21,158
Whiskey.

302
00:51:30,117 --> 00:51:32,908
Tell him to respect
the storm next time.

303
00:51:41,992 --> 00:51:43,660
It's on him.

304
00:54:11,158 --> 00:54:13,325
King who would be man.

305
00:54:13,325 --> 00:54:16,990
Son of a human father
and Queen of the Seas.

306
00:54:17,492 --> 00:54:19,283
All the time I've wasted

307
00:54:19,283 --> 00:54:22,617
trying to keep the promise
I made to your mother.

308
00:54:24,492 --> 00:54:25,992
Are you finished,
old man?

309
00:54:25,992 --> 00:54:28,533
You never sleep
in the same place twice,

310
00:54:28,533 --> 00:54:31,450
yet you keep coming back here.

311
00:54:33,283 --> 00:54:35,660
I like it.
It's quiet.

312
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,283
It's your inheritance.

313
00:54:37,283 --> 00:54:39,617
You're the rightful king
of Atlantis.

314
00:54:40,617 --> 00:54:41,950
Our people suffer.

315
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:43,950
Your people.

316
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:47,700
A brutal, petty,
superstitious race.

317
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,992
Is the surface any different?

318
00:54:49,992 --> 00:54:52,283
Nobody calls me
King of the Surface.

319
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,408
What do you want, Vulko?

320
00:54:55,408 --> 00:54:56,908
Guards near
the stronghold

321
00:54:56,908 --> 00:54:58,533
have been disappearing.

322
00:54:58,533 --> 00:55:00,117
Snatchers from above.

323
00:55:00,117 --> 00:55:01,408
Talk to King Orm.

324
00:55:01,408 --> 00:55:02,992
- Your brother?
- Half-brother.

325
00:55:02,992 --> 00:55:06,533
He's trying to fan the flames
of war with the surface.

326
00:55:06,533 --> 00:55:09,200
He lies.

327
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,533
The snatchers have come
from the dark place.

328
00:55:11,533 --> 00:55:14,033
They're looking for it.

329
00:55:14,033 --> 00:55:18,408
The Mother Box
our people guard is not safe.

330
00:55:18,408 --> 00:55:21,033
Go to the stronghold
of Atlantis.

331
00:55:21,033 --> 00:55:23,492
Protect the box.

332
00:55:23,492 --> 00:55:25,330
The time has come.

333
00:55:26,825 --> 00:55:29,220
Take up your mother's trident.

334
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:43,867
You can't turn your back
on the world forever, Arthur.

335
00:55:44,658 --> 00:55:47,700
Above or below.

336
00:56:16,825 --> 00:56:18,575
DeSaad.

337
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:22,658
DeSaad!
I call to thee.

338
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:36,783
Steppenwolf,
have you begun the conquest?

339
00:56:36,783 --> 00:56:39,992
This world is divided.

340
00:56:39,992 --> 00:56:41,617
They are a primitive species.

341
00:56:41,617 --> 00:56:44,200
Unevolved and at war
with one another.

342
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,117
Too separate to be one.

343
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:49,617
Their free will
must be ripped from them,

344
00:56:49,617 --> 00:56:51,533
like the other worlds.

345
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:55,950
Given absolution
in one glorious belief,

346
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:58,492
to serve him.

347
00:56:58,492 --> 00:57:00,950
The Mother Boxes?

348
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,950
I have found one of the three.

349
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:06,617
The one that woke
and called to me.

350
00:57:06,617 --> 00:57:08,242
The other two still sleep,

351
00:57:08,242 --> 00:57:12,408
but the parademons
feel their presence.

352
00:57:12,408 --> 00:57:13,908
They fly,

353
00:57:13,908 --> 00:57:17,575
they search, they take
prisoners who carry the scent,

354
00:57:17,575 --> 00:57:23,242
while I build a stronghold
in the name of his glory.

355
00:57:23,242 --> 00:57:25,200
Yes.

356
00:57:26,117 --> 00:57:30,117
Mighty Steppenwolf,

357
00:57:30,117 --> 00:57:34,825
who might have sat here
by the side of the great one.

358
00:57:36,575 --> 00:57:41,325
But undone by his self-pride.

359
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:43,908
DeSaad…

360
00:57:44,825 --> 00:57:47,950
I fall before you.

361
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:49,950
Let me make a plea to him

362
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:51,908
that I may come home

363
00:57:51,908 --> 00:57:54,700
after I take this world
in his name.

364
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:57,533
You betrayed him.

365
00:57:58,825 --> 00:58:00,492
Your own family.

366
00:58:00,492 --> 00:58:02,700
I saw my mistake.

367
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,660
I slaughtered those
who sought his throne.

368
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:10,825
You still owe the great one
50,000 more worlds.

369
00:58:11,783 --> 00:58:14,075
He will hear your plea

370
00:58:14,075 --> 00:58:16,450
when you pay your debt.

371
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,492
The Mother Boxes
will be found and united.

372
00:58:23,283 --> 00:58:25,533
No protectors here.

373
00:58:25,533 --> 00:58:29,033
No Lanterns, no Kryptonian.

374
00:58:29,033 --> 00:58:32,950
This world will fall,
like all the others.

375
00:58:33,867 --> 00:58:35,742
For Darkseid.

376
00:58:38,825 --> 00:58:41,158
For Darkseid.

377
00:59:02,242 --> 00:59:04,283
You know,
I paid millions of dollars

378
00:59:04,283 --> 00:59:05,950
for this building's security.

379
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:07,742
You got
your money's worth.

380
00:59:07,742 --> 00:59:10,367
Took me almost a minute
to disable it.

381
00:59:11,825 --> 00:59:13,200
Hi, there.

382
00:59:14,742 --> 00:59:16,658
A new toy?

383
00:59:16,658 --> 00:59:18,950
Prototype troop carrier.

384
00:59:20,492 --> 00:59:22,075
I once knew a man

385
00:59:22,075 --> 00:59:24,742
who would have loved
to fly it.

386
00:59:24,742 --> 00:59:26,440
The best minds
at Wayne Aerospace

387
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,330
couldn't make it fly.

388
00:59:28,867 --> 00:59:30,617
But you can?

389
00:59:30,617 --> 00:59:32,325
I have no choice.

390
00:59:32,325 --> 00:59:35,242
I need more range
and I need more cargo.

391
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:37,367
I think there's
an attack coming.

392
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:39,908
Not coming, Bruce.

393
00:59:39,908 --> 00:59:42,658
It's already here.

394
00:59:42,658 --> 00:59:44,533
From what I've learned,

395
00:59:44,533 --> 00:59:47,367
they are things
from another universe.

396
00:59:47,367 --> 00:59:49,908
They serve a dark power.

397
00:59:49,908 --> 00:59:51,742
An old power.

398
00:59:51,742 --> 00:59:53,158
What do they want?

399
00:59:53,158 --> 00:59:57,367
To invade.
To conquer.

400
00:59:57,367 --> 01:00:01,825
They came here
once before, long ago.

401
01:00:06,742 --> 01:00:09,325
<i>A great armada
appeared in the sky,</i>

402
01:00:09,325 --> 01:00:11,992
<i>laying waste
to all who opposed it.</i>

403
01:00:11,992 --> 01:00:16,283
<i>The leader of the invaders
was a being called Darkseid.</i>

404
01:00:16,283 --> 01:00:21,408
<i>A name cursed and feared
in every universe.</i>

405
01:00:21,408 --> 01:00:25,617
<i>Darkseid was met in battle
by Earth's defenders.</i>

406
01:00:25,617 --> 01:00:28,533
<i>The old gods, men,</i>

407
01:00:28,533 --> 01:00:32,110
<i>Atlanteans before
their descent into the sea,</i>

408
01:00:33,992 --> 01:00:38,242
<i>Amazons before their betrayal
and enslavement</i>

409
01:00:38,242 --> 01:00:40,742
<i>and guardians from the stars.</i>

410
01:00:40,742 --> 01:00:42,825
<i>Their histories
had taught them</i>

411
01:00:42,825 --> 01:00:44,533
<i>not to trust each other,</i>

412
01:00:44,533 --> 01:00:46,950
<i>not to hope for an alliance.</i>

413
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:49,075
<i>To fight apart.</i>

414
01:01:37,825 --> 01:01:40,825
<i>As Darkseid
waged war on Earth,</i>

415
01:01:40,825 --> 01:01:42,283
<i>he found a secret there.</i>

416
01:01:42,283 --> 01:01:46,325
<i>A power hidden
in the infinity of space.</i>

417
01:01:46,325 --> 01:01:48,300
<i>He called forth mystics</i>

418
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:51,325
<i>who worshipped and controlled
three objects,</i>

419
01:01:51,325 --> 01:01:52,742
<i>the Mother Boxes.</i>

420
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:54,325
Wait, wait, wait.

421
01:01:54,325 --> 01:01:55,408
"Mother Boxes"?

422
01:01:55,408 --> 01:01:58,575
Indestructible
living machines,

423
01:01:58,575 --> 01:02:01,450
<i>made from a science
so advanced,</i>

424
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:03,617
<i>it looks like sorcery.</i>

425
01:02:03,617 --> 01:02:06,492
<i>To conquer, three boxes
have to synchronize</i>

426
01:02:06,492 --> 01:02:09,867
<i>and join together
into The Unity.</i>

427
01:02:09,867 --> 01:02:13,033
<i>The Unity cleanses
a planet with fire,</i>

428
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:16,825
<i>transforming it into a copy
of the enemy's world.</i>

429
01:02:16,825 --> 01:02:20,575
<i>All who live
become servants of Darkseid.</i>

430
01:02:20,575 --> 01:02:23,742
<i>Alive but drained of life.</i>

431
01:02:23,742 --> 01:02:25,400
<i>Parademons.</i>

432
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,533
Amazons!

433
01:02:34,367 --> 01:02:36,075
With me!

434
01:03:05,117 --> 01:03:07,867
<i>But before The Unity
could synchronize,</i>

435
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:10,075
<i>the defenders of Earth
attacked</i>

436
01:03:10,075 --> 01:03:11,908
<i>and fought as one.</i>

437
01:03:11,908 --> 01:03:14,800
<i>Amazons alongside Atlanteans.</i>

438
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,825
<i>Zeus and his son Ares</i>

439
01:03:16,825 --> 01:03:20,492
<i>alongside the guardians
from the sky.</i>

440
01:03:20,492 --> 01:03:23,825
<i>A golden Age of Heroes
fighting together</i>

441
01:03:23,825 --> 01:03:25,850
<i>to defend life on Earth.</i>

442
01:05:21,825 --> 01:05:24,783
<i>They did what no world
had ever done.</i>

443
01:05:24,783 --> 01:05:27,800
<i>Sent the enemies
back into the stars.</i>

444
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:33,325
<i>The three Mother Boxes
never synchronized.</i>

445
01:05:33,325 --> 01:05:36,783
<i>The Unity never came to pass.</i>

446
01:05:36,783 --> 01:05:39,492
<i>But in their retreat,</i>

447
01:05:39,492 --> 01:05:42,783
<i>the boxes were left behind
on Earth.</i>

448
01:05:42,783 --> 01:05:46,783
<i>They grew weak.
Dogs without masters,</i>

449
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:50,200
<i>falling asleep,</i>

450
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,700
<i>awaiting their return.</i>

451
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,200
<i>Fading from the view
of the enemy,</i>

452
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,700
<i>anonymous
among a trillion worlds.</i>

453
01:06:15,325 --> 01:06:18,908
<i>The defenders of Earth
made a vow.</i>

454
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:22,050
<i>Men, Atlanteans, and Amazons.</i>

455
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:24,158
<i>Each would enshrine and guard</i>

456
01:06:24,158 --> 01:06:26,770
<i>one of the three
sleeping Mother Boxes</i>

457
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:29,992
<i>according to the rites
and rituals of their culture</i>

458
01:06:29,992 --> 01:06:32,825
<i>in case a box
should ever wake again</i>

459
01:06:32,825 --> 01:06:34,658
<i>to call out
to the planet Apokolips</i>

460
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:36,492
<i>to return and conquer</i>

461
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:40,617
<i>the only world
Darkseid had ever lost.</i>

462
01:07:56,283 --> 01:07:59,658
Something woke the box
my people guard.

463
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,908
It called out
to the dark place…

464
01:08:01,908 --> 01:08:04,533
to one of Darkseid's
conquerors.

465
01:08:05,325 --> 01:08:07,700
The enemy is here.

466
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,450
If he's here, where is he?

467
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:11,658
He'll be searching
for the other two boxes.

468
01:08:11,658 --> 01:08:14,783
Hiding until he has all three.
Until he's ready.

469
01:08:14,783 --> 01:08:19,325
Then we have to be ready.
You, me, the others.

470
01:08:19,325 --> 01:08:22,533
They said the Age of Heroes
would never come again.

471
01:08:22,533 --> 01:08:24,117
No, it will.

472
01:08:24,117 --> 01:08:25,950
It has to.

473
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:31,200
The others.
Where are they?

474
01:08:53,117 --> 01:08:54,200
Am I late?

475
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,742
No, I'm so late.
I'm very late.

476
01:08:56,742 --> 01:08:58,492
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey.

477
01:08:58,492 --> 01:09:00,325
Oh. No.

478
01:09:00,325 --> 01:09:03,367
Okay, bye. Okay.

479
01:09:03,367 --> 01:09:05,825
I'm so sorry.

480
01:09:05,825 --> 01:09:07,158
I'm late.

481
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:13,992
- Are you, uh…
- I'm…

482
01:09:13,992 --> 01:09:16,220
I'm so sorry I'm so late.
I didn't mean to be so late.

483
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,990
I'm me and I'm here
and I'm so sorry I'm late.

484
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:19,330
Essentially,
the bus didn't come,

485
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:20,242
then the bus did come,

486
01:09:20,242 --> 01:09:21,367
but then there was
this old woman

487
01:09:21,367 --> 01:09:22,658
counting change for the fare,

488
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,158
like, nickel, penny,
nickel, penny.

489
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:25,825
Like, jeez Louise,
let this woman on the bus.

490
01:09:25,825 --> 01:09:27,000
She's 107 years old,

491
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,867
these are some of her
last few moments of life.

492
01:09:28,867 --> 01:09:31,408
Resume.

493
01:09:34,617 --> 01:09:36,492
Come on.

494
01:09:39,075 --> 01:09:40,200
Come on.

495
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,825
From the French, of course.

496
01:09:41,825 --> 01:09:45,117
<i>"Resume,"</i> I believe,
is a past participle of…

497
01:09:50,408 --> 01:09:52,242
Uh, wow. That's no good.

498
01:09:52,242 --> 01:09:54,033
It's like, what lives
in my pocket, right?

499
01:09:54,033 --> 01:09:56,825
"Paper monster hungry."
Uh…

500
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:07,658
Come on. Supposed to be
friends now.

501
01:10:13,867 --> 01:10:15,325
Yes.

502
01:10:23,992 --> 01:10:26,575
Central City College,
I'm a criminal justice major.

503
01:10:26,575 --> 01:10:27,800
You said you had experience

504
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,117
walking dogs.

505
01:13:09,408 --> 01:13:11,575
Oh, gosh,
I hope everyone's okay.

506
01:13:11,575 --> 01:13:14,400
See, in times of crisis,
for dog work,

507
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,220
I always bring a meat snack.

508
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:17,800
'Cause it makes them
feel calm.

509
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,000
'Cause you never know what's
gonna happen in this city.

510
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,867
I mean, oh, my gosh.

511
01:13:21,867 --> 01:13:24,575
Right?
I start on Monday?

512
01:14:02,658 --> 01:14:05,533
You have been
near a Mother Box.

513
01:14:06,617 --> 01:14:09,242
The scent is on you.

514
01:14:09,242 --> 01:14:10,742
Where is it?

515
01:14:10,742 --> 01:14:14,408
No son or daughter of Atlantis
will ever tell you.

516
01:14:29,283 --> 01:14:31,330
Our people have guarded
the Mother Box

517
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:33,220
for thousands of years.

518
01:14:38,283 --> 01:14:41,158
I will never betray
my own people.

519
01:14:52,575 --> 01:14:55,158
You already have.

520
01:15:55,242 --> 01:15:58,242
<i>This was taken in
the deepest trench on Earth.</i>

521
01:15:58,242 --> 01:16:00,492
He must be an Atlantean.

522
01:16:00,492 --> 01:16:01,950
A water-breather.

523
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:03,575
He was breathing air
when I talked to him.

524
01:16:03,575 --> 01:16:05,533
Mixed-blood, then.

525
01:16:05,533 --> 01:16:07,617
He said he'll fight with us?

526
01:16:07,617 --> 01:16:09,075
More or less.

527
01:16:10,283 --> 01:16:12,783
More more or more less?

528
01:16:12,783 --> 01:16:13,908
Probably more less.

529
01:16:13,908 --> 01:16:16,117
- He said no?
- He said no.

530
01:16:16,117 --> 01:16:18,742
Atlanteans
can be tricky.

531
01:16:18,742 --> 01:16:21,700
My people went to war
with them once.

532
01:16:22,658 --> 01:16:24,783
I'm not sure we can trust him.

533
01:16:24,783 --> 01:16:26,117
Diana,
if we're gonna do this,

534
01:16:26,117 --> 01:16:27,000
you're gonna need to be open

535
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,742
to more things
that we didn't…

536
01:16:28,742 --> 01:16:29,950
You know…

537
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:31,450
- I'm sorry. That's okay.
- Sorry. My fault.

538
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:32,742
Don't worry about it.

539
01:16:32,742 --> 01:16:34,075
- Let's…
- It happens.

540
01:16:34,075 --> 01:16:35,110
So,

541
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:37,367
This is
the third person.

542
01:16:37,367 --> 01:16:40,033
Disappears for 1/30
of a second here.

543
01:16:40,033 --> 01:16:41,700
One frame of video, see?

544
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:44,450
Barry Allen.
Central City.

545
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:45,350
Go to him.

546
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,283
I'll work on number four.

547
01:16:47,283 --> 01:16:50,450
Organic and biomechatronic
body parts.

548
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:55,200
He's a cyborg.

549
01:17:14,158 --> 01:17:16,325
- Ready!
- Break!

550
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,117
Three.

551
01:17:33,117 --> 01:17:34,742
Eighty.

552
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:38,400
Set, go!

553
01:17:50,867 --> 01:17:53,800
<i>Your son may be captain
of the football team</i>

554
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,700
and a certified genius,
Mrs. Stone…

555
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:01,117
Dr. Stone.

556
01:18:01,117 --> 01:18:03,367
…but that doesn't mean
he can hack into our system

557
01:18:03,367 --> 01:18:06,033
to change his friend's grades.

558
01:18:06,033 --> 01:18:10,033
Sarah's family
lost their house this year.

559
01:18:10,033 --> 01:18:12,990
How could that child
pass her classes?

560
01:18:13,992 --> 01:18:17,325
Victor helped her
'cause he's got a good heart.

561
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:19,492
What did you do to help her?

562
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:46,575
- Your father…
- Mom, Mom, don't.

563
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:50,950
He got held up at the lab.

564
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:54,158
Okay.
He always does.

565
01:19:56,575 --> 01:19:58,158
He wanted to be here.

566
01:19:58,158 --> 01:20:00,075
You always say that.

567
01:20:00,075 --> 01:20:02,000
Ma, you gotta stop
making excuses for him.

568
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,825
You're just as busy as he is,
but you still make the time.

569
01:20:04,825 --> 01:20:08,700
He just has difficulty
showing it, but…

570
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:11,075
I know he's proud of you.

571
01:20:11,075 --> 01:20:13,742
We both are, Victor.

572
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:16,950
Hey, hey, hey.

573
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:20,158
With everything I know
you can do today,

574
01:20:20,158 --> 01:20:23,220
I can't wait to see
what you're gonna be tomorrow.

575
01:20:28,283 --> 01:20:30,200
<i>Dr. Stone,
I'm sorry,</i>

576
01:20:31,158 --> 01:20:33,117
your wife didn't survive.

577
01:20:34,575 --> 01:20:36,908
I'm afraid
your son won't either.

578
01:20:50,867 --> 01:20:52,700
I won't let you die.

579
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,550
I won't allow it.

580
01:21:03,408 --> 01:21:05,283
I won't allow it.

581
01:21:08,658 --> 01:21:09,742
Victor.

582
01:21:10,867 --> 01:21:14,450
Victor, you're not
stuck in here.

583
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:17,825
You still have a life
ahead of you.

584
01:21:17,825 --> 01:21:21,770
Your mother would have
wanted you to live that life.

585
01:21:23,908 --> 01:21:25,617
If you were there,

586
01:21:26,825 --> 01:21:29,220
Mom would still be alive.

587
01:21:31,575 --> 01:21:33,575
All right, look,

588
01:21:34,742 --> 01:21:37,242
you don't have to give me
a second chance, but

589
01:21:37,242 --> 01:21:39,033
give yourself one.

590
01:21:40,825 --> 01:21:44,117
If you can't stand
looking at me,

591
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,450
try listening.

592
01:22:15,908 --> 01:22:18,658
<i>What you can do now, Victor.</i>

593
01:22:18,658 --> 01:22:22,575
<i>Your physical strength is
just the tip of the iceberg.</i>

594
01:22:22,575 --> 01:22:25,283
<i>The tip of the tip.</i>

595
01:22:55,075 --> 01:22:57,283
<i>In the world
of ones and zeroes,</i>

596
01:22:57,283 --> 01:23:00,200
<i>you are the absolute master.</i>

597
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,950
<i>No firewall can stop you.</i>

598
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:05,408
<i>No encryption can defy you.</i>

599
01:23:05,408 --> 01:23:08,200
<i>We're all at your mercy, Vic.</i>

600
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,825
<i>From our power grids
to our telecommunications,</i>

601
01:23:10,825 --> 01:23:12,992
<i>everyone's lives
are controlled</i>

602
01:23:12,992 --> 01:23:16,117
<i>and dominated
by complex digital networks</i>

603
01:23:16,117 --> 01:23:21,000
<i>that will bend
without effort to your will.</i>

604
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:32,325
<i>The fate of the world</i>

605
01:23:32,325 --> 01:23:35,367
<i>will literally
rest in your hands.</i>

606
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:45,158
<i>Its entire nuclear arsenal,</i>

607
01:23:45,158 --> 01:23:48,200
<i>you could launch
with a thought.</i>

608
01:23:58,783 --> 01:24:00,367
<i>The world's monetary systems</i>

609
01:24:00,367 --> 01:24:01,900
<i>and its complex interactions</i>

610
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:05,075
<i>will seem as easy
to manipulate for you</i>

611
01:24:05,075 --> 01:24:06,825
<i>as a child's plaything.</i>

612
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:45,325
<i>The question…
No, the challenge</i>

613
01:24:45,325 --> 01:24:48,617
<i>won't be doing it.</i>

614
01:24:48,617 --> 01:24:50,742
<i>It will be not doing.</i>

615
01:24:50,742 --> 01:24:52,867
<i>Not seeing.</i>

616
01:24:54,617 --> 01:24:57,033
<i>It is the burden
of this responsibility</i>

617
01:24:57,033 --> 01:25:00,658
<i>that will define you
and who you choose to be.</i>

618
01:25:32,117 --> 01:25:33,242
<i>Now, make a wish.</i>

619
01:25:34,492 --> 01:25:36,408
<i>One more time.</i>

620
01:25:36,408 --> 01:25:38,992
<i>Good job.
Wave to Grandma!</i>

621
01:25:38,992 --> 01:25:40,325
<i>Hi, Grandma!</i>

622
01:26:40,367 --> 01:26:41,617
What?

623
01:26:43,450 --> 01:26:45,600
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

624
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:47,950
Oh, my God.

625
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:50,220
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

626
01:26:55,075 --> 01:26:57,908
<i>Victor…</i>

627
01:26:57,908 --> 01:27:02,492
<i>Victor, these are the words
and deductions of a scientist.</i>

628
01:27:02,492 --> 01:27:05,575
<i>That's how I've been
speaking to you.</i>

629
01:27:05,575 --> 01:27:08,533
<i>Now,</i>

630
01:27:08,533 --> 01:27:13,117
<i>let me speak to you
from my heart, not as a scientist,</i>

631
01:27:13,117 --> 01:27:14,880
<i>as a father.</i>

632
01:27:28,658 --> 01:27:29,908
Hey.

633
01:27:31,117 --> 01:27:33,220
Hey, you!

634
01:27:48,408 --> 01:27:51,992
<i>Because you are
holding yourself back.</i>

635
01:27:51,992 --> 01:27:55,158
You're going in circles, man.

636
01:27:55,158 --> 01:27:57,500
Holding down
three dead-end jobs,

637
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,600
going on four.

638
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:00,367
Where do you
even find the time?

639
01:28:00,367 --> 01:28:01,400
I make the time.

640
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,117
- I just need one more gig…
- Barry.

641
01:28:03,117 --> 01:28:04,117
…then I'm gonna pay
for my own tuition.

642
01:28:04,117 --> 01:28:04,800
You can't.

643
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,600
Like I always said
I would.

645
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:07,500
{\an8}You cannot keep
doing this to yourself.

646
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,700
Okay. I really don't wanna
talk about this again.

647
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:11,770
- Please, we have 10 minutes.
- And, this is all to pay

648
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:13,450
for a criminal justice
degree, huh?

649
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:13,825
Yeah.

650
01:28:13,825 --> 01:28:15,000
For what?

651
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,500
Huh, let's see.
As I talk to my father,

652
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,000
who's still in prison
for the murder

653
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,492
of my mother,
which he didn't commit.

654
01:28:21,492 --> 01:28:23,450
Yeah, how did I get interested
in criminal justice?

655
01:28:23,450 --> 01:28:25,200
I can't remember.

656
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,200
Oh, boy.

657
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:29,742
This path has clearly
chosen me, Dad.

658
01:28:29,742 --> 01:28:31,440
Give me your hand, man.

659
01:28:36,325 --> 01:28:39,658
I want you
to listen to me, Barry.

660
01:28:39,658 --> 01:28:43,492
I want you to listen to me,
because I mean this.

661
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,325
I want you
to give all that up.

662
01:28:54,117 --> 01:28:57,367
And, I want you to stop
coming to see me.

663
01:28:59,617 --> 01:29:02,783
I am a drag on your life.

664
01:29:08,075 --> 01:29:09,992
Okay. Um…

665
01:29:09,992 --> 01:29:13,700
Please don't ever
say that to me again.

666
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:14,992
Please.

667
01:29:14,992 --> 01:29:16,450
Hey, you know what
criminal justice

668
01:29:16,450 --> 01:29:18,325
would be for me?

669
01:29:18,325 --> 01:29:23,242
My son not wasting his life.

670
01:29:24,492 --> 01:29:26,367
You can be whatever
you wanna be.

671
01:29:26,367 --> 01:29:27,867
You're brilliant, man.

672
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:33,200
Absolute best of the best.

673
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:39,825
I can't sit here and watch you
run in place in Central City

674
01:29:39,825 --> 01:29:41,700
for some old dude

675
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:44,908
who's not going anywhere.

676
01:29:44,908 --> 01:29:46,575
- Dad, that's not true.
- It's time.

677
01:29:46,575 --> 01:29:47,867
That's not true.

678
01:29:47,867 --> 01:29:49,325
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

679
01:29:49,325 --> 01:29:51,075
I want you to make
your own future.

680
01:29:51,075 --> 01:29:53,033
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

681
01:29:53,033 --> 01:29:54,700
Open gate.

682
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:56,033
Great.

683
01:29:59,658 --> 01:30:02,033
"You're living in the past.
Make your own future, Barry."

684
01:30:02,033 --> 01:30:03,700
Clear.
Close the gate.

685
01:30:56,325 --> 01:30:59,825
Barry Allen.
Bruce Wayne.

686
01:30:59,825 --> 01:31:01,492
You said that like it explains

687
01:31:01,492 --> 01:31:03,825
why there's a total stranger
in my place

688
01:31:03,825 --> 01:31:06,908
sitting in the dark,
in my second favorite chair.

689
01:31:08,867 --> 01:31:10,825
Tell me about this.

690
01:31:14,658 --> 01:31:17,658
This is a person
who looks exactly like me,

691
01:31:17,658 --> 01:31:20,830
but who is definitely not me.

692
01:31:21,492 --> 01:31:23,533
Somebody… I don't know.

693
01:31:23,533 --> 01:31:25,492
Hippie, long hair.

694
01:31:25,492 --> 01:31:28,450
Very attractive Jewish boy.

695
01:31:29,742 --> 01:31:32,575
Who drinks milk,
I don't drink milk.

696
01:31:32,575 --> 01:31:34,242
I know you have abilities.

697
01:31:34,242 --> 01:31:36,575
I just don't know
what they are.

698
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:37,658
My special skills

699
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:40,492
include viola, web design,

700
01:31:40,492 --> 01:31:43,533
fluent in sign language,
gorilla sign language.

701
01:31:43,533 --> 01:31:47,283
Silica-based
sand quartz fabric.

702
01:31:47,283 --> 01:31:49,533
Abrasion resistant,
heat resistant.

703
01:31:49,533 --> 01:31:51,800
Uh, yeah, I do
competitive ice dancing.

704
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,533
It's what they use
on the space shuttle

705
01:31:53,533 --> 01:31:55,500
to prevent it from
burning up on re-entry.

706
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:59,200
I do very competitive
ice dancing.

707
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,283
Look, man.
I don't know who you are,

708
01:32:01,283 --> 01:32:03,575
but whoever
you're looking for,

709
01:32:03,575 --> 01:32:04,990
it's not me.

710
01:32:46,408 --> 01:32:48,408
You're the Batman?

711
01:32:48,408 --> 01:32:51,325
So, you're fast.

712
01:32:51,325 --> 01:32:53,075
That feels
like an oversimplification.

713
01:32:53,075 --> 01:32:54,992
I'm putting together a team.

714
01:32:54,992 --> 01:32:57,200
People with special abilities.

715
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:58,950
You see,
I believe enemies are coming.

716
01:32:58,950 --> 01:33:01,158
Stop right there.
I'm in.

717
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:03,575
You are?

718
01:33:03,575 --> 01:33:04,825
Just like that?

719
01:33:04,825 --> 01:33:06,075
Yeah.

720
01:33:07,908 --> 01:33:10,492
I need friends.

721
01:33:10,492 --> 01:33:13,992
Great. Great.

722
01:33:13,992 --> 01:33:16,200
Can I keep this?

723
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,660
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

724
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:20,075
and it seems
to manipulate space-time.

725
01:33:20,075 --> 01:33:21,575
I call it the Speed Force.

726
01:33:21,575 --> 01:33:23,408
Causes me to burn a tremendous
amount of calories,

727
01:33:23,408 --> 01:33:26,283
so I am just a black hole
of snacks.

728
01:33:26,283 --> 01:33:28,783
I am a snack hole.

729
01:33:28,783 --> 01:33:31,908
How many people are
on this special fight team?

730
01:33:31,908 --> 01:33:34,075
- Three, including you.
- Three?

731
01:33:34,075 --> 01:33:36,783
Against what?

732
01:33:36,783 --> 01:33:38,950
I'll tell you on the plane.

733
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:40,658
Plane?

734
01:33:40,658 --> 01:33:42,742
What are
your superpowers again?

735
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:44,533
I'm rich.

736
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:09,325
Oh, Miss Prince,
let me do that.

737
01:34:09,325 --> 01:34:12,492
No, that's okay.
I can do it myself.

738
01:34:12,492 --> 01:34:14,325
Would you like
to have some?

739
01:34:14,325 --> 01:34:15,742
Uh, no, thank you.

740
01:34:16,908 --> 01:34:19,492
If you put the water in first.

741
01:34:19,492 --> 01:34:22,825
- Of course.
- So, we don't scald the tea.

742
01:34:25,575 --> 01:34:27,200
- Yes.
- Great.

743
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,492
No, that's probably
enough tea.

744
01:34:29,492 --> 01:34:31,867
All right.

745
01:34:31,867 --> 01:34:33,492
Are you sure you don't
wanna have some?

746
01:34:33,492 --> 01:34:37,575
I won't, thank you.
And then leave it to mash.

747
01:34:37,575 --> 01:34:40,700
I will.
I will, definitely will.

748
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:43,117
Uh… What are you working on?

749
01:34:43,117 --> 01:34:44,867
It's a gauntlet

750
01:34:44,867 --> 01:34:48,867
lined with specialized
polymer solar cells.

751
01:34:48,867 --> 01:34:51,367
- Wow.
- Here, let me show you.

752
01:34:51,367 --> 01:34:54,533
We borrowed this from
the Kryptonian scout ship.

753
01:34:56,033 --> 01:34:57,800
Oh, maybe you should, uh…

754
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,299
a fraction.
Thank you, thank you.

755
01:34:58,417 --> 01:35:00,299
{\an8}Of course.

756
01:35:05,367 --> 01:35:07,158
Ah.

757
01:35:07,158 --> 01:35:10,367
Ah, now,
let's see how that did.

758
01:35:10,367 --> 01:35:12,783
Ha! Yes.

759
01:35:12,783 --> 01:35:14,450
Not to be sneezed at.

760
01:35:14,450 --> 01:35:17,158
A gauntlet that captures
and dissipates energy.

761
01:35:17,158 --> 01:35:18,867
It's Master Wayne's idea.

762
01:35:18,867 --> 01:35:21,325
Maybe you should work
on a lasso, too?

763
01:35:21,325 --> 01:35:24,158
- In black, of course.
- Oh.

764
01:35:30,908 --> 01:35:34,660
All right.
Victor Stone.

765
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:52,700
Something is not working.

766
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:54,450
Mmm.

767
01:36:03,908 --> 01:36:06,533
Looks like you have a date,
Miss Prince.

768
01:37:03,367 --> 01:37:06,700
Why are you looking
for me, Diana?

769
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:08,075
You know who I am.

770
01:37:08,075 --> 01:37:10,770
I know more than you
can possibly imagine.

771
01:37:10,770 --> 01:37:13,908
Then maybe you already know
I need your help.

772
01:37:13,908 --> 01:37:15,660
The world does.

773
01:37:16,325 --> 01:37:18,117
Fuck the world.

774
01:37:19,492 --> 01:37:22,117
You've obviously
been through a great deal.

775
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:26,325
I can't begin to imagine what.

776
01:37:26,325 --> 01:37:30,158
But whatever happened to you,
you have gifts now.

777
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:31,867
Gifts?

778
01:37:31,867 --> 01:37:34,500
What part of this
looks like a gift to you?

779
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,117
We need you, Victor.

780
01:37:36,117 --> 01:37:37,867
And maybe you need us.

781
01:37:37,867 --> 01:37:39,700
I don't need anyone.

782
01:37:41,783 --> 01:37:42,992
Not anymore.

783
01:37:42,992 --> 01:37:45,990
I told myself the same
for a long time.

784
01:37:52,242 --> 01:37:55,158
I lost someone I loved once.

785
01:37:57,867 --> 01:38:02,825
I shut myself off
from everyone.

786
01:38:04,242 --> 01:38:07,200
But I had to learn
to open back up again.

787
01:38:09,658 --> 01:38:12,850
The truth is,
I'm still working on it.

788
01:38:12,850 --> 01:38:17,408
And if you asked to meet me,

789
01:38:17,408 --> 01:38:20,283
you're working on it, too.

790
01:39:31,783 --> 01:39:33,800
You were right
about the metal sample

791
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,575
from the Superman ship.

792
01:39:35,575 --> 01:39:39,283
When we bombard it with X-rays
from the electron-laser,

793
01:39:39,283 --> 01:39:40,867
look what happens.

794
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:51,658
3.5 million kelvin.

795
01:39:51,658 --> 01:39:54,950
The inner core of the metal
becomes superheated.

796
01:39:54,950 --> 01:39:57,408
Hot, dense matter.

797
01:40:00,408 --> 01:40:03,492
You're looking at
the hottest thing on Earth.

798
01:40:03,492 --> 01:40:05,867
Exact words I said
to my prom date.

799
01:40:05,867 --> 01:40:07,533
She dumped me anyway.

800
01:40:07,533 --> 01:40:08,867
Yeah.

801
01:40:12,992 --> 01:40:14,158
Hey Doc,

802
01:40:14,158 --> 01:40:15,950
do you think
Batman is connected

803
01:40:15,950 --> 01:40:19,575
to the object
the CID is looking for?

804
01:40:19,575 --> 01:40:22,867
You know, 6-1-9-8-2?

805
01:40:23,950 --> 01:40:25,117
No.

806
01:40:26,033 --> 01:40:27,325
I don't.

807
01:41:02,033 --> 01:41:04,242
Oh, Victor.

808
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,283
All right!
Let's go!

809
01:41:24,408 --> 01:41:25,783
Commissioner Gordon?

810
01:41:27,075 --> 01:41:28,367
Your messages.

811
01:41:32,533 --> 01:41:35,242
Don't have to see the sky
to know it's a full moon.

812
01:41:35,242 --> 01:41:38,550
Half of Gotham's reality-challenged
community showed up.

813
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:40,990
Say they saw flying monsters
by the harbor.

814
01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:42,783
You were right, Ma.
Police Academy.

815
01:41:42,783 --> 01:41:44,658
What's wrong
with dental school?

816
01:41:47,533 --> 01:41:50,783
"Attacked by
a flying vampire."

817
01:41:50,783 --> 01:41:54,200
"Looked like a giant bat
with huge fangs."

818
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,867
On a possibly related note,

819
01:41:55,867 --> 01:41:58,325
sketch of the suspect
in the abductions

820
01:41:58,325 --> 01:41:59,700
at the lab across the harbor.

821
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:03,283
- Looks like…
- I know what it looks like, Crispus.

822
01:42:03,283 --> 01:42:06,150
Come on, you think he fights
criminals for 20 years here

823
01:42:06,150 --> 01:42:08,950
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

824
01:42:09,825 --> 01:42:11,158
I'll talk to him tonight.

825
01:42:11,158 --> 01:42:12,825
How, Jim?

826
01:42:12,825 --> 01:42:14,408
How do you think?

827
01:42:32,492 --> 01:42:34,033
Silas?

828
01:42:34,033 --> 01:42:35,408
Hey, hey.

829
01:42:35,408 --> 01:42:36,825
Hey, hey!

830
01:42:41,325 --> 01:42:43,825
- Oh, my goodness.
- Where's the cyborg?

831
01:42:43,825 --> 01:42:45,783
His name is Victor.

832
01:42:45,783 --> 01:42:48,700
We met, spoke.

833
01:42:49,533 --> 01:42:51,700
Give him time.

834
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:53,990
You must be Barry.
I'm Diana.

835
01:42:53,990 --> 01:42:57,617
Hi, Barry. I'm Diana.
That's not right. Great.

836
01:42:57,617 --> 01:43:00,117
- So, this is us.
- Yeah, this is us.

837
01:43:00,117 --> 01:43:01,450
Oh!

838
01:43:01,450 --> 01:43:04,325
Awesome! It's the Bat-Signal.
That's your…

839
01:43:04,325 --> 01:43:06,658
- Oh, sorry.
- That's your signal.

840
01:43:06,658 --> 01:43:08,200
That means we have to go now.

841
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:11,992
- Yeah, that's what that means.
- It's so cool.

842
01:44:09,075 --> 01:44:11,200
Commander Mera,
I told the king

843
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:12,825
the perimeter guards
were taken.

844
01:44:12,825 --> 01:44:14,492
He won't send reinforcements.

845
01:44:14,492 --> 01:44:17,242
He says all the reserves are
needed in the rebel regions.

846
01:44:17,242 --> 01:44:20,400
He's as shortsighted
as he is cruel.

847
01:44:21,742 --> 01:44:23,450
All right, take what men
we have left

848
01:44:23,450 --> 01:44:25,660
and form a phalanx
around the Mother Box.

849
01:46:05,158 --> 01:46:07,950
You can't escape.

850
01:46:07,950 --> 01:46:10,033
I'm not trying to.

851
01:48:12,367 --> 01:48:14,742
Vulko told me
you would come.

852
01:48:14,742 --> 01:48:18,220
The firstborn
of beloved Queen Atlanna.

853
01:48:20,242 --> 01:48:21,575
Wait.

854
01:48:23,533 --> 01:48:24,700
Please.

855
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:29,658
I knew her.

856
01:48:31,742 --> 01:48:34,200
Well, that makes one of us.

857
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:37,783
My parents died in the wars.

858
01:48:37,783 --> 01:48:39,367
She took me in.

859
01:48:39,367 --> 01:48:41,200
What a saint.

860
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:43,450
You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?

861
01:48:43,450 --> 01:48:46,325
Your queen left me
on my father's doorstep

862
01:48:46,325 --> 01:48:48,033
and never gave me
another thought.

863
01:48:48,033 --> 01:48:51,367
Your mother left you
to save your life.

864
01:48:51,367 --> 01:48:54,075
You cannot imagine
how it hurt her.

865
01:48:55,533 --> 01:48:57,658
What it cost her.

866
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:01,400
But you're not
a defenseless child now.

867
01:49:03,283 --> 01:49:05,033
It would have been
her responsibility

868
01:49:05,033 --> 01:49:08,450
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop him.

869
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:10,158
Now,

870
01:49:11,325 --> 01:49:12,783
it's yours.

871
01:50:17,033 --> 01:50:18,900
Yes.

872
01:50:41,367 --> 01:50:42,867
<i>Steppenwolf,</i>

873
01:50:42,867 --> 01:50:44,908
tell me what you've learned.

874
01:50:44,908 --> 01:50:47,658
Two boxes
found and awake.

875
01:50:47,658 --> 01:50:50,783
With the combined power
of the two Mother Boxes,

876
01:50:50,783 --> 01:50:54,033
I've been able to finish
the stronghold's defenses.

877
01:50:54,033 --> 01:50:56,575
Where is the third Mother Box?

878
01:50:56,575 --> 01:50:59,242
The parademons
sense its presence

879
01:50:59,242 --> 01:51:00,950
and search for the third.

880
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:02,158
They have taken prisoners

881
01:51:02,158 --> 01:51:05,033
who carry its scent.

882
01:51:05,033 --> 01:51:06,825
Go.

883
01:51:06,825 --> 01:51:08,908
Interrogate the prisoners.

884
01:51:09,617 --> 01:51:11,617
Find the third.

885
01:51:12,908 --> 01:51:16,367
They will tell me
what they know,

886
01:51:16,367 --> 01:51:19,075
or I will rip it from them.

887
01:52:02,242 --> 01:52:04,000
How many of you are there?

888
01:52:04,742 --> 01:52:06,880
Not enough.

889
01:52:07,742 --> 01:52:10,242
Dozens of witnesses
all over Gotham.

890
01:52:10,242 --> 01:52:11,617
Description
matches the suspect

891
01:52:11,617 --> 01:52:13,617
in the Metropolis abductions.

892
01:52:13,617 --> 01:52:15,325
Parademons.

893
01:52:15,325 --> 01:52:16,825
Okay.

894
01:52:16,825 --> 01:52:19,242
The demons must have caught
the scent of a Mother Box.

895
01:52:19,242 --> 01:52:20,440
At the lab.

896
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:22,720
They carried people away
to find out what they know.

897
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:24,158
So, the eight
may still be alive.

898
01:52:24,158 --> 01:52:25,200
Nine.

899
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:27,075
Oh.

900
01:52:27,075 --> 01:52:30,220
The head of STARLABS
was taken tonight.

901
01:52:34,825 --> 01:52:37,617
Wow, okay.
So, another scientist.

902
01:52:37,617 --> 01:52:39,075
So, how do we find him?

903
01:52:39,075 --> 01:52:41,000
There must be a nest nearby.

904
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,117
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

905
01:52:45,117 --> 01:52:47,367
No discernible pattern
I can see.

906
01:52:47,367 --> 01:52:48,992
The lines on the map
don't converge.

907
01:52:48,992 --> 01:52:50,880
On land.

908
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,330
These lead back
to Stryker's Island,

909
01:52:52,330 --> 01:52:53,158
between the two cities.

910
01:52:53,158 --> 01:52:54,367
These are air vents.

911
01:52:54,367 --> 01:52:55,600
They all lead
down to the tunnel

912
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:58,200
to a Metropolis project
that was abandoned in '29.

913
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:00,575
The nest could be there.

914
01:53:00,575 --> 01:53:02,617
Uh,
is he coming with us now,

915
01:53:02,617 --> 01:53:04,617
because we're not all
gonna fit in your car.

916
01:53:04,617 --> 01:53:06,158
I have something bigger.

917
01:53:07,367 --> 01:53:10,158
Do you really think that…

918
01:53:10,158 --> 01:53:13,992
Oh, wow, they just…
They really just vanish, huh?

919
01:53:13,992 --> 01:53:16,617
Oh. That's rude.

920
01:53:55,158 --> 01:53:57,408
We're close.

921
01:53:57,408 --> 01:53:59,575
The scent of the enemy.

922
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:01,950
Of absence.

923
01:54:01,950 --> 01:54:04,200
Darkness.

924
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:05,533
Death.

925
01:54:05,533 --> 01:54:06,908
Where are we, Alfred?

926
01:54:06,908 --> 01:54:08,033
<i>Stryker's Island.</i>

927
01:54:08,033 --> 01:54:10,450
You should be directly under

928
01:54:10,450 --> 01:54:13,075
the venting tower
for the tunnel.

929
01:54:13,075 --> 01:54:14,533
<i>Now look to your left,</i>

930
01:54:14,533 --> 01:54:16,533
<i>you'll see a staircase
to the machine room.</i>

931
01:54:16,533 --> 01:54:19,367
<i>Thermal scan shows
a cluster of people there.</i>

932
01:54:19,367 --> 01:54:20,783
That's it.

933
01:54:20,783 --> 01:54:22,117
Let's go.

934
01:54:35,992 --> 01:54:38,783
Right.
Is there… Is there a plan?

935
01:54:40,242 --> 01:54:41,575
Either of you?

936
01:54:41,575 --> 01:54:43,617
Don't engage alone.

937
01:54:43,617 --> 01:54:45,550
We do this together.

938
01:54:53,867 --> 01:54:55,825
I heard about you.

939
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:59,075
Didn't think you were real.

940
01:54:59,075 --> 01:55:00,742
I'm real when it's useful.

941
01:55:10,742 --> 01:55:12,742
I grow tired of your silence.

942
01:55:12,742 --> 01:55:15,550
Now tell me,
where is the Mother Box?

943
01:55:21,825 --> 01:55:24,200
Please.
We have families.

944
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:26,492
Then you have weakness.

945
01:55:26,492 --> 01:55:27,950
Steppenwolf.

946
01:55:27,950 --> 01:55:32,450
Okay, I'm guessing
that's the bad guy.

947
01:55:32,450 --> 01:55:33,867
Good guess.

948
01:55:33,867 --> 01:55:37,617
I'm really, really missing
Superman right now.

949
01:55:37,617 --> 01:55:39,867
Circle to the other side.

950
01:55:39,867 --> 01:55:42,440
We'll surround them
and surprise him.

951
01:55:46,450 --> 01:55:48,533
You have been
near a Mother Box.

952
01:55:48,533 --> 01:55:50,283
The scent is on you.

953
01:55:50,283 --> 01:55:51,950
I don't know
what you're talking about.

954
01:55:51,950 --> 01:55:54,033
- Where is it?
- Leave him alone!

955
01:55:54,033 --> 01:55:56,408
He… He doesn't know.

956
01:55:59,825 --> 01:56:01,990
Wait, please, please!

957
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:10,325
You carry the scent, too.
But stronger.

958
01:56:10,325 --> 01:56:12,658
I will die before I tell you.

959
01:56:12,658 --> 01:56:14,992
You'll die if you don't.

960
01:56:14,992 --> 01:56:16,075
No!

961
01:56:25,325 --> 01:56:26,408
Victor.

962
01:56:26,408 --> 01:56:27,783
Kill them both.

963
01:56:31,325 --> 01:56:33,783
Ah, Amazon.

964
01:56:33,783 --> 01:56:36,533
But not like your sisters.

965
01:56:36,533 --> 01:56:38,320
Stronger.

966
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:10,500
Amazon.

967
01:57:13,367 --> 01:57:15,075
Hold!

968
01:57:15,075 --> 01:57:17,500
This one will be mine.

969
01:57:19,242 --> 01:57:21,825
I belong to no one.

970
01:57:35,700 --> 01:57:38,350
Guys, this is not together.

971
01:57:44,658 --> 01:57:46,242
Help get those people
out of here.

972
01:57:46,242 --> 01:57:48,283
I'll make sure these things
follow me.

973
01:57:58,158 --> 01:57:59,742
Everybody, move!

974
01:58:08,408 --> 01:58:10,033
A little quicker.

975
01:58:12,242 --> 01:58:13,783
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

976
01:58:13,783 --> 01:58:16,367
I've got this.
Keep moving.

977
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:19,283
This way.

978
01:58:55,492 --> 01:58:57,158
The energy is dissipating.

979
01:58:57,158 --> 01:58:59,825
<i>My gauntlet worked!</i>

980
01:58:59,825 --> 01:59:02,367
Celebrate later, Alfred.
I need the Nightcrawler.

981
01:59:02,367 --> 01:59:04,450
Thought you'd never ask.

982
01:59:04,450 --> 01:59:07,500
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

983
01:59:36,867 --> 01:59:38,075
Thank you, Alfred.

984
01:59:38,075 --> 01:59:39,700
Don't mention it.

985
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:03,283
No!

986
02:00:06,867 --> 02:00:07,950
Whew.

987
02:00:11,075 --> 02:00:12,750
They're safe.
Get back to the tunnel.

988
02:00:12,750 --> 02:00:16,075
Tunnel. Right.
Aliens, bad guy, sword lady.

989
02:00:27,742 --> 02:00:29,158
My turn.

990
02:01:51,283 --> 02:01:53,200
Catastrophic failure
of all systems.

991
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:55,658
Are you all right,
Master Wayne?

992
02:01:55,658 --> 02:01:56,825
Are you all right?

993
02:02:07,242 --> 02:02:10,992
You have the blood
of the old gods in you.

994
02:02:25,283 --> 02:02:26,867
You okay?

995
02:02:26,867 --> 02:02:28,200
Mm.

996
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:29,992
Wasn't sure you'd come.

997
02:02:30,908 --> 02:02:32,325
You're my father.

998
02:02:35,742 --> 02:02:36,825
Go.

999
02:02:50,367 --> 02:02:51,450
No!

1000
02:03:36,658 --> 02:03:39,283
Relax, Alfred.
I'll take it from here.

1001
02:03:40,783 --> 02:03:42,700
Uh, do I know you?

1002
02:04:13,450 --> 02:04:14,825
What are we under,
right now?

1003
02:04:15,492 --> 02:04:16,867
Gotham Harbor.

1004
02:04:55,492 --> 02:04:56,867
Who is that?

1005
02:05:22,117 --> 02:05:23,408
Come on.

1006
02:05:28,408 --> 02:05:30,100
Diana, get on!

1007
02:06:31,533 --> 02:06:33,158
What is it?

1008
02:06:40,867 --> 02:06:42,367
Show me.

1009
02:07:21,408 --> 02:07:23,783
It is here.

1010
02:07:23,783 --> 02:07:26,867
On this world.

1011
02:08:00,575 --> 02:08:02,158
Sir, you're gonna
be in quarantine

1012
02:08:02,158 --> 02:08:03,658
for possible alien microbes.

1013
02:08:03,658 --> 02:08:05,533
U.S. government protocols
require that…

1014
02:08:05,533 --> 02:08:08,533
I know the requirements.
I wrote them.

1015
02:08:12,867 --> 02:08:14,450
It called to him.

1016
02:08:14,450 --> 02:08:16,117
The Mother Box.

1017
02:08:16,117 --> 02:08:17,700
The one he already has.

1018
02:08:17,700 --> 02:08:21,200
He has two. He took
the Mother Box from Atlantis.

1019
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:23,450
All he needs now
is the lost Box of Men.

1020
02:08:23,450 --> 02:08:25,220
If he doesn't already have it.

1021
02:08:28,367 --> 02:08:29,908
He doesn't have it.

1022
02:08:33,075 --> 02:08:34,325
I do.

1023
02:08:44,658 --> 02:08:46,992
Have you finished
the conquest?

1024
02:08:46,992 --> 02:08:48,367
Not yet, DeSaad.

1025
02:08:48,367 --> 02:08:50,825
Then why do you summon me?

1026
02:08:50,825 --> 02:08:52,492
I bring news.

1027
02:08:52,492 --> 02:08:55,575
Before mighty Darkseid
came to the throne,

1028
02:08:55,575 --> 02:09:00,825
he searched the universe
for the ultimate weapon.

1029
02:09:00,825 --> 02:09:03,075
The Anti-Life Equation.

1030
02:09:03,075 --> 02:09:05,242
The key to
controlling all life

1031
02:09:05,242 --> 02:09:08,100
and all will
throughout the multiverse.

1032
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:11,075
He found it hidden on a primitive
planet, but before…

1033
02:09:11,075 --> 02:09:14,158
The story of the defiance
is well-known.

1034
02:09:14,158 --> 02:09:16,908
I have found
the primitive planet.

1035
02:09:16,908 --> 02:09:19,158
The world that fought back.

1036
02:09:19,158 --> 02:09:21,117
It is Earth.

1037
02:09:21,117 --> 02:09:23,450
The Anti-Life Equation
is carved

1038
02:09:23,450 --> 02:09:27,492
into the surface
of this very world.

1039
02:09:31,117 --> 02:09:32,700
Are you certain?

1040
02:09:32,700 --> 02:09:33,783
I have seen it.

1041
02:09:33,783 --> 02:09:38,500
I have looked
with my own eyes

1042
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:40,100
on Anti-Life.

1043
02:10:20,700 --> 02:10:22,367
My lord.

1044
02:10:23,825 --> 02:10:27,825
Oh, Steppenwolf.

1045
02:10:27,825 --> 02:10:31,950
My lord, I am
but your humble servant.

1046
02:10:31,950 --> 02:10:34,992
Can it be true
that you have found it?

1047
02:10:34,992 --> 02:10:38,033
I have, great one.

1048
02:10:38,033 --> 02:10:41,158
The lost world is Earth.

1049
02:10:41,158 --> 02:10:45,325
Anti-Life is here.

1050
02:10:45,325 --> 02:10:48,742
If it is redemption you seek,
find the third box,

1051
02:10:48,742 --> 02:10:52,033
synchronize The Unity,
and when this world is scorched,

1052
02:10:52,033 --> 02:10:55,450
I will come
for my great prize.

1053
02:10:56,242 --> 02:10:59,408
You will come to Earth?

1054
02:10:59,408 --> 02:11:03,908
I have turned
100,000 worlds to dust

1055
02:11:03,908 --> 02:11:05,492
looking for Anti-Life.

1056
02:11:05,492 --> 02:11:08,867
Looking for those
who robbed me of my glory.

1057
02:11:08,867 --> 02:11:12,350
I will stride
across their bones

1058
02:11:12,350 --> 02:11:14,867
and bask in the glow
of Anti-Life.

1059
02:11:14,867 --> 02:11:17,783
And all of existence

1060
02:11:17,783 --> 02:11:21,283
shall be mine.

1061
02:11:24,658 --> 02:11:28,742
It shall be so,
my master.

1062
02:11:32,825 --> 02:11:34,533
So cool.

1063
02:11:34,533 --> 02:11:37,617
From the outside, it looks like
this building was abandoned.

1064
02:11:40,950 --> 02:11:42,825
It wants to fly.

1065
02:11:43,867 --> 02:11:45,992
You talk to machines?

1066
02:11:45,992 --> 02:11:48,158
I speak
to intelligence.

1067
02:11:48,158 --> 02:11:49,533
This one's saying
she can't fly

1068
02:11:49,533 --> 02:11:51,158
because of a software issue,

1069
02:11:51,158 --> 02:11:53,325
but I could fix it
with a little time.

1070
02:12:02,908 --> 02:12:05,450
There's a dark spot
in my data stream.

1071
02:12:05,450 --> 02:12:07,950
I could feel
the other two boxes.

1072
02:12:07,950 --> 02:12:09,867
I know they're awake,

1073
02:12:09,867 --> 02:12:11,533
but I can't see
where they are.

1074
02:12:11,533 --> 02:12:13,825
Well, we can't attack unless
we know where the base is.

1075
02:12:13,825 --> 02:12:16,075
Even if we knew,

1076
02:12:16,075 --> 02:12:19,500
I've never seen a being
as strong as Steppenwolf.

1077
02:12:21,283 --> 02:12:22,700
Maybe one.

1078
02:12:22,700 --> 02:12:25,158
Hmm, Superman.

1079
02:12:25,158 --> 02:12:26,950
As long as
the third box is asleep,

1080
02:12:26,950 --> 02:12:29,367
they can't see it,
only sense it.

1081
02:12:29,367 --> 02:12:31,700
We need to keep moving
so they can't catch up.

1082
02:12:31,700 --> 02:12:33,325
No. That's just a strategy

1083
02:12:33,325 --> 02:12:35,408
to lose more slowly,
not to win.

1084
02:12:35,408 --> 02:12:38,325
Remind me, are flamethrowers
not a thing?

1085
02:12:38,325 --> 02:12:39,700
Why don't we just destroy it?

1086
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:41,783
Fire doesn't
destroy the boxes.

1087
02:12:41,783 --> 02:12:43,700
They're an unknown form
of matter.

1088
02:12:43,700 --> 02:12:45,033
Oh, they love heat.

1089
02:12:45,033 --> 02:12:47,367
They absorb it,
hold it in their cores.

1090
02:12:47,367 --> 02:12:50,200
Well, you know
a lot about these boxes.

1091
02:12:50,200 --> 02:12:51,492
Makes you think.

1092
02:12:51,492 --> 02:12:54,158
Where'd you find the box,
Victor?

1093
02:12:54,158 --> 02:12:55,992
Are you trying
to say something?

1094
02:12:55,992 --> 02:12:57,950
Oh, I'm saying it.

1095
02:12:57,950 --> 02:13:00,033
How do we know you're not
working for them?

1096
02:13:01,825 --> 02:13:03,867
It's a long story.

1097
02:13:03,867 --> 02:13:05,950
You got somewhere else to be?

1098
02:13:13,200 --> 02:13:14,825
The Nazis found the box

1099
02:13:14,825 --> 02:13:17,117
at the end
of the Second World War,

1100
02:13:17,117 --> 02:13:20,325
buried under
an Italian monastery.

1101
02:13:20,325 --> 02:13:22,825
The Allies intercepted it
on its way to Hitler.

1102
02:13:22,825 --> 02:13:25,783
They brought it back
to the States in '44.

1103
02:13:25,783 --> 02:13:30,117
Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.

1104
02:13:30,117 --> 02:13:32,200
It collected dust
in the Pentagon archives

1105
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:34,075
for 70 years

1106
02:13:34,075 --> 02:13:37,575
till DoD began to study
the Superman ship.

1107
02:13:38,867 --> 02:13:41,750
A researcher at STARLABS
made a connection

1108
02:13:41,750 --> 02:13:43,783
between the ship

1109
02:13:43,783 --> 02:13:46,033
and 6-1-9-8-2.

1110
02:13:46,033 --> 02:13:49,700
He understood they were
both alien technologies.

1111
02:13:49,700 --> 02:13:51,867
Different civilizations,

1112
02:13:51,867 --> 02:13:55,117
similar properties.

1113
02:13:55,117 --> 02:13:58,533
And though the box had slept
for thousands of years,

1114
02:13:58,533 --> 02:14:02,200
the researcher formulated
a theory on how to awaken it.

1115
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:04,075
And so did.

1116
02:14:06,325 --> 02:14:07,800
Then,

1117
02:14:09,283 --> 02:14:12,533
I had an accident
that should've killed me.

1118
02:14:12,533 --> 02:14:15,867
But in an act of desperation
or madness,

1119
02:14:15,867 --> 02:14:18,850
the researcher harnessed
the power of the Mother Box.

1120
02:14:34,408 --> 02:14:36,742
He unleashed
an alien technology

1121
02:14:36,742 --> 02:14:39,492
he didn't fully understand.

1122
02:14:39,492 --> 02:14:42,440
He used that power
to keep me alive.

1123
02:14:45,617 --> 02:14:47,700
Alive

1124
02:14:47,700 --> 02:14:49,825
but turned into this.

1125
02:14:52,450 --> 02:14:55,658
The box went back to sleep

1126
02:14:55,658 --> 02:14:57,492
and he never returned it.

1127
02:14:59,908 --> 02:15:02,400
That researcher
was Silas Stone.

1128
02:15:03,783 --> 02:15:05,492
My father.

1129
02:15:08,742 --> 02:15:10,367
Wait,

1130
02:15:10,367 --> 02:15:13,950
your father saved your life
with one of these things?

1131
02:15:13,950 --> 02:15:16,450
Aren't they
psycho murder machines?

1132
02:15:16,450 --> 02:15:18,783
They're change machines.

1133
02:15:18,783 --> 02:15:22,075
The boxes don't think in terms
of healing or killing,

1134
02:15:22,075 --> 02:15:24,117
alive or dead.

1135
02:15:24,117 --> 02:15:26,700
They rearrange matter
at the will of their masters,

1136
02:15:26,700 --> 02:15:28,492
regenerate, reinstate.

1137
02:15:28,492 --> 02:15:30,100
Reinstate?

1138
02:15:30,100 --> 02:15:31,000
A box has the power

1139
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,533
to reinstate anterior
particle relationships.

1140
02:15:33,533 --> 02:15:35,575
So, you mean in the way
that particles of matter

1141
02:15:35,575 --> 02:15:36,990
can't be created or destroyed,

1142
02:15:36,990 --> 02:15:38,950
their relations
just transform.

1143
02:15:38,950 --> 02:15:41,867
Burn down a house,
the particles still exist.

1144
02:15:41,867 --> 02:15:44,492
Particles of house
become particles of smoke.

1145
02:15:44,492 --> 02:15:49,220
Anybody with a match
can turn a house to smoke.

1146
02:15:50,700 --> 02:15:52,533
But a Mother Box…

1147
02:15:52,533 --> 02:15:54,992
…turns smoke
back into a house.

1148
02:16:00,700 --> 02:16:03,492
I know we're all thinking
the same thing right now.

1149
02:16:04,658 --> 02:16:07,450
Who's gonna say it?
I'm not gonna say it.

1150
02:16:34,617 --> 02:16:36,408
Who is it?

1151
02:16:36,408 --> 02:16:37,700
Martha.

1152
02:16:42,367 --> 02:16:43,700
Hi.

1153
02:16:45,450 --> 02:16:46,950
Hi.

1154
02:16:55,908 --> 02:16:57,450
I went to the <i>Daily Planet</i>

1155
02:16:57,450 --> 02:17:01,410
to finally pick up
Clark's things.

1156
02:17:02,408 --> 02:17:05,908
I don't know why,
nowhere to put them now.

1157
02:17:08,575 --> 02:17:10,325
I lost the farm.

1158
02:17:11,700 --> 02:17:15,242
I'd been behind on
the payments for a while.

1159
02:17:15,242 --> 02:17:16,867
Truth is, the house is too big

1160
02:17:16,867 --> 02:17:19,575
for me to live in
by myself anyway.

1161
02:17:19,575 --> 02:17:22,800
Well, you know you're welcome
to stay here any time

1162
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:24,783
for as long as you need.

1163
02:17:25,783 --> 02:17:28,617
Thank you, Lois.
That's very kind.

1164
02:17:29,992 --> 02:17:32,408
But I've found a little place
that suits me just fine,

1165
02:17:32,408 --> 02:17:34,492
right by the diner.

1166
02:17:34,492 --> 02:17:37,117
I'm not here for help.

1167
02:17:37,117 --> 02:17:39,617
I'm here because

1168
02:17:39,617 --> 02:17:42,325
when I saw Mr. Perry,
he told me that

1169
02:17:43,533 --> 02:17:46,700
you haven't been to work
since Clark died.

1170
02:17:51,408 --> 02:17:53,117
I can't.

1171
02:17:59,783 --> 02:18:02,533
The whole world is mourning.

1172
02:18:03,783 --> 02:18:06,200
Grieving over a symbol.

1173
02:18:06,200 --> 02:18:10,325
Everywhere I go, everywhere
I look, I see that "S".

1174
02:18:11,283 --> 02:18:13,450
I hear what people say.

1175
02:18:13,450 --> 02:18:15,450
They talk like they knew him.

1176
02:18:16,492 --> 02:18:18,950
But they didn't know Clark.

1177
02:18:20,325 --> 02:18:22,658
And I can't stop them

1178
02:18:22,658 --> 02:18:27,283
and look at them and tell them
how proud I am of my son.

1179
02:18:29,075 --> 02:18:31,825
You're the only one who knows.

1180
02:18:31,825 --> 02:18:34,367
Who feels what I do.

1181
02:18:35,492 --> 02:18:38,658
Burdened by a secret
on top of grief.

1182
02:18:41,533 --> 02:18:45,117
I came all this way
because I wanted…

1183
02:18:45,117 --> 02:18:47,500
because I wanted to see you.

1184
02:18:48,408 --> 02:18:50,533
Tell you

1185
02:18:50,533 --> 02:18:52,492
I understand.

1186
02:18:54,367 --> 02:18:56,450
I

1187
02:18:56,450 --> 02:19:00,367
will never love anybody
the way that I love your son.

1188
02:19:03,950 --> 02:19:06,117
And I just miss him.

1189
02:19:07,117 --> 02:19:09,742
I miss him so much.

1190
02:19:16,033 --> 02:19:17,867
So do I, sweetheart.

1191
02:19:22,283 --> 02:19:27,283
Martha, you know if there's
anything you need, I'm here.

1192
02:19:30,658 --> 02:19:33,492
There is something
you can do for me, honey.

1193
02:19:35,742 --> 02:19:38,158
Come back to the living.

1194
02:20:17,950 --> 02:20:20,992
The world needs you,
too, Lois.

1195
02:20:24,617 --> 02:20:26,117
<i>The dead are dead.</i>

1196
02:20:26,117 --> 02:20:28,300
The box brought Victor back.

1197
02:20:28,300 --> 02:20:29,783
Victor wasn't dead.

1198
02:20:29,783 --> 02:20:31,658
Life is either one or zero.

1199
02:20:31,658 --> 02:20:34,742
It's to be or not to be.
Not both.

1200
02:20:34,742 --> 02:20:36,900
Can you operate this box,
Victor?

1201
02:20:36,900 --> 02:20:37,867
Of course.

1202
02:20:37,867 --> 02:20:40,408
But we don't know enough
about Kryptonian biology.

1203
02:20:40,408 --> 02:20:42,492
There's no telling
what's gonna happen.

1204
02:20:44,200 --> 02:20:45,825
Okay, but…

1205
02:20:45,825 --> 02:20:50,200
I mean, we have to try.
Don't we? We have to try.

1206
02:20:50,200 --> 02:20:51,617
What do we have to lose?

1207
02:20:51,617 --> 02:20:54,500
We cannot try
unless we activate the box.

1208
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:55,783
As soon as it wakes up…

1209
02:20:55,783 --> 02:20:58,283
…the enemy sees it, comes,

1210
02:20:58,283 --> 02:21:01,300
activates The Unity.
The end.

1211
02:21:01,300 --> 02:21:03,450
So, what we have to lose
is the entire planet

1212
02:21:03,450 --> 02:21:05,700
to a bunch of genocidal aliens.
That's good to know.

1213
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:08,325
Even if Superman could return,

1214
02:21:08,325 --> 02:21:10,492
who's to say that
he could defeat them?

1215
02:21:10,492 --> 02:21:12,492
The Mother Box did.

1216
02:21:12,492 --> 02:21:14,990
Victor's father
activated a Mother Box

1217
02:21:14,990 --> 02:21:17,867
more than a year ago
when Superman was still alive.

1218
02:21:17,867 --> 02:21:19,825
Didn't call out
to Steppenwolf.

1219
02:21:19,825 --> 02:21:21,533
None of the boxes did.
Not until…

1220
02:21:21,533 --> 02:21:26,283
Not until Superman died.

1221
02:21:26,283 --> 02:21:28,325
It's like they were
afraid of him?

1222
02:21:28,325 --> 02:21:31,408
Yes, they were
afraid of him.

1223
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:36,158
This is the only way.

1224
02:21:37,492 --> 02:21:41,575
There are six, not five.
There is no us without him.

1225
02:22:08,800 --> 02:22:10,967
Cross this one off
the bucket list.

1226
02:22:10,967 --> 02:22:15,008
Exhume Superman
from the grave. Check.

1227
02:22:16,758 --> 02:22:19,467
You know we could do this
in a nanosecond, right?

1228
02:22:20,092 --> 02:22:21,550
We could.

1229
02:22:28,967 --> 02:22:30,717
He was my hero.

1230
02:22:33,217 --> 02:22:34,550
All right.

1231
02:22:38,008 --> 02:22:41,300
An Amazon
working with an Atlantean.

1232
02:22:41,300 --> 02:22:42,633
Half-Atlantean.

1233
02:22:44,217 --> 02:22:47,675
How many thousands of years
since our people spoke?

1234
02:22:47,675 --> 02:22:51,800
I don't know.
I'm not exactly close to mine.

1235
02:22:51,800 --> 02:22:54,842
I hate Atlanteans as much
as you Amazons do.

1236
02:22:54,842 --> 02:22:56,967
Hate is useless.

1237
02:23:00,008 --> 02:23:01,383
Yep.

1238
02:23:02,592 --> 02:23:04,300
No, thank you.

1239
02:23:08,675 --> 02:23:09,883
You know, my father told me

1240
02:23:09,883 --> 02:23:11,800
there's a saying
in Atlantis

1241
02:23:13,300 --> 02:23:15,717
"None are taken back
from the darkness."

1242
02:23:15,717 --> 02:23:18,675
"Not without
giving one up in return."

1243
02:23:20,758 --> 02:23:22,467
We say the same thing.

1244
02:23:25,008 --> 02:23:26,842
How about that?

1245
02:23:26,842 --> 02:23:28,842
Wonder Woman.

1246
02:23:30,050 --> 02:23:31,000
What do you think, man?

1247
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:34,383
You think she'd ever
go for a younger guy?

1248
02:23:34,383 --> 02:23:37,133
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.

1249
02:23:38,842 --> 02:23:40,842
Every guy's a younger guy.

1250
02:23:42,717 --> 02:23:43,800
Jesus.

1251
02:23:45,300 --> 02:23:47,133
Oh, Christ.

1252
02:23:49,467 --> 02:23:52,092
Oh, bloody…

1253
02:23:53,383 --> 02:23:54,467
Any luck?

1254
02:23:54,467 --> 02:23:55,883
If by "luck" you mean

1255
02:23:55,883 --> 02:23:59,008
"chance in hell
we'll get it flying today,"

1256
02:23:59,008 --> 02:24:01,175
then, no. No luck.

1257
02:24:01,925 --> 02:24:03,425
It's okay.

1258
02:24:03,425 --> 02:24:05,467
It doesn't matter.
We're just gonna take the body

1259
02:24:05,467 --> 02:24:06,400
to the Kryptonian ship.

1260
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:07,900
It's basically
an organic computer.

1261
02:24:07,900 --> 02:24:09,925
It can talk directly
to the Mother Box.

1262
02:24:09,925 --> 02:24:12,633
What? The way it talked
to Lex Luthor?

1263
02:24:12,633 --> 02:24:14,092
Something like that.

1264
02:24:15,300 --> 02:24:17,883
What could possibly
go wrong?

1265
02:24:24,383 --> 02:24:26,008
Master Wayne,

1266
02:24:27,967 --> 02:24:29,425
you did it!

1267
02:24:29,425 --> 02:24:33,092
You put the team together
to fight this war.

1268
02:24:33,092 --> 02:24:36,342
You've fulfilled your promise.

1269
02:24:36,342 --> 02:24:40,342
But to try to do that.
I mean,

1270
02:24:40,342 --> 02:24:43,383
your guilt's
overcome your reason.

1271
02:24:43,383 --> 02:24:45,633
Not all the king's horses
nor all the king's men…

1272
02:24:45,633 --> 02:24:49,092
But Alfred, for once,
I'm operating strictly on faith,

1273
02:24:49,092 --> 02:24:51,508
not on reason.

1274
02:24:51,508 --> 02:24:55,967
But if you start playing with
this little box of tricks,

1275
02:24:55,967 --> 02:24:58,175
I mean, it could be
the end of everything.

1276
02:24:58,175 --> 02:25:01,300
How do you know
your team's strong enough?

1277
02:25:01,300 --> 02:25:03,842
If you can't bring down
the charging bull,

1278
02:25:03,842 --> 02:25:05,900
then don't wave
the red cape at it.

1279
02:25:05,900 --> 02:25:07,550
You do when
it's this red cape.

1280
02:25:07,550 --> 02:25:09,883
This red cape charges back.

1281
02:25:24,508 --> 02:25:25,800
Okay.

1282
02:25:32,425 --> 02:25:35,092
You were right, Dr. Stone.
The tests came back negative.

1283
02:25:35,092 --> 02:25:36,800
Everyone's clear,
including you.

1284
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:39,800
Just to be on the safe side,
we swept the entire facility.

1285
02:25:39,800 --> 02:25:41,700
Well, thank you, Thomas.
That means I'm free to go?

1286
02:25:41,700 --> 02:25:42,592
Absolutely.

1287
02:25:46,383 --> 02:25:47,800
- Thanks.
- Listen up, everyone.

1288
02:25:47,800 --> 02:25:50,425
You're all clear.
So, gather your things.

1289
02:25:50,425 --> 02:25:52,133
If you need
more medical attention…

1290
02:25:52,133 --> 02:25:56,008
Arthur, yes, your opinion.
Less preposterous. Option "A"?

1291
02:25:56,008 --> 02:25:57,508
- Definitely not "A."
- Okay.

1292
02:25:57,508 --> 02:26:00,758
Or "B"?

1293
02:26:02,217 --> 02:26:03,633
Let me see "A" again?

1294
02:26:09,092 --> 02:26:12,425
Right.
We should get dressed.

1295
02:26:14,383 --> 02:26:16,508
I'm always dressed.

1296
02:26:43,508 --> 02:26:44,800
ID?

1297
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:46,050
ID.

1298
02:26:49,175 --> 02:26:50,383
Aye, aye.

1299
02:26:52,592 --> 02:26:53,925
"Aye, aye"?

1300
02:27:17,008 --> 02:27:18,467
Okay.

1301
02:27:18,467 --> 02:27:20,675
"Okay"?
Oh, gee, okay!

1302
02:27:27,592 --> 02:27:28,550
Doc!

1303
02:27:28,550 --> 02:27:29,900
They let you out
of quarantine.

1304
02:27:29,900 --> 02:27:31,800
Yeah, I finally got them
to listen to reason.

1305
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:33,900
Now, let's take a look and see
what progress we've made

1306
02:27:33,900 --> 02:27:35,200
with the electron-laser.

1307
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:38,200
We've made some real progress.
Let me show you.

1308
02:27:52,633 --> 02:27:55,550
Victor, clear this place out.

1309
02:27:55,550 --> 02:27:57,008
Done.

1310
02:28:00,800 --> 02:28:03,550
<i>Code Red.
Contamination breach.</i>

1311
02:28:03,550 --> 02:28:06,967
<i>All personnel
evacuate immediately.</i>

1312
02:28:06,967 --> 02:28:09,258
Bio red five.

1313
02:28:09,258 --> 02:28:11,842
The sensor's picking up
a microbe of alien origin.

1314
02:28:11,842 --> 02:28:14,717
A microbe of alien origin?
That doesn't make any sense.

1315
02:28:14,717 --> 02:28:15,800
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1316
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:18,258
All right, people,
shut it down. Let's go.

1317
02:28:18,258 --> 02:28:19,800
- Ryan, we just had it swept.
- We have to go, Doc.

1318
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:21,217
Think about it.
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1319
02:28:21,217 --> 02:28:22,675
- Let's go, Doc.
- Think about it.

1320
02:28:22,675 --> 02:28:23,758
Full base evacuation!
Everyone out!

1321
02:28:23,758 --> 02:28:25,967
Look, wait! Wait! Shit!

1322
02:28:25,967 --> 02:28:28,925
<i>Remain calm and
proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

1323
02:28:35,342 --> 02:28:37,175
<i>Attention, all personnel.</i>

1324
02:28:37,175 --> 02:28:40,217
Go! Go! Everybody out!
Come on! Move!

1325
02:28:40,217 --> 02:28:42,008
Move! Come on! Go, go!

1326
02:28:42,008 --> 02:28:43,675
Everybody out! Go!

1327
02:29:03,883 --> 02:29:06,758
Yes! Gotcha!

1328
02:29:06,758 --> 02:29:09,592
Post Commander, this is
Dr. Silas Stone, do you read?

1329
02:29:09,592 --> 02:29:12,217
- <i>Go ahead, Dr. Stone.</i>
- This is a false alarm.

1330
02:29:12,217 --> 02:29:15,200
Someone has hacked into
the system. We must alert…

1331
02:29:24,925 --> 02:29:26,425
Victor.

1332
02:29:27,883 --> 02:29:30,383
<i>Dr. Stone, you there?
I don't copy.</i>

1333
02:29:31,300 --> 02:29:32,425
I was mistaken.

1334
02:29:32,425 --> 02:29:33,717
The alarm's legit.

1335
02:29:33,717 --> 02:29:35,600
Everybody out.
And nobody, I repeat,

1336
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:38,508
nobody comes back inside
without my say-so.

1337
02:29:38,508 --> 02:29:39,883
<i>Roger that, sir.</i>

1338
02:29:49,925 --> 02:29:51,717
Get the civilians out!

1339
02:29:51,717 --> 02:29:52,925
Let's go! Let's go!

1340
02:29:57,092 --> 02:29:58,550
- Everybody got out okay?
- I think so.

1341
02:29:58,550 --> 02:29:59,717
- Everybody?
- Yes.

1342
02:30:32,967 --> 02:30:34,300
This way.

1343
02:30:44,717 --> 02:30:47,758
It knows he's here.

1344
02:30:47,758 --> 02:30:49,967
Ooh, that's intense.

1345
02:30:54,342 --> 02:30:56,342
This is amazing.

1346
02:30:57,050 --> 02:30:58,425
This is crazy.

1347
02:30:58,425 --> 02:31:00,342
Oh, what? Now it's crazy?

1348
02:31:00,342 --> 02:31:03,008
You two lunatics
better know what you're doing.

1349
02:33:28,758 --> 02:33:30,800
<i>Systems coming online.</i>

1350
02:33:33,508 --> 02:33:35,925
<i>Welcome, Victor.</i>

1351
02:33:35,925 --> 02:33:37,883
<i>Would you like
to assume command?</i>

1352
02:33:37,883 --> 02:33:38,967
I'm in.

1353
02:33:48,175 --> 02:33:50,508
The ship says
the Mother Box is hostile.

1354
02:33:50,508 --> 02:33:52,342
I can override
the security protocols,

1355
02:33:52,342 --> 02:33:54,175
but there's no time to repair
all the electrical damage

1356
02:33:54,175 --> 02:33:55,633
that Luthor's
power surges caused

1357
02:33:55,633 --> 02:33:56,800
to the primary capacitors.

1358
02:33:56,800 --> 02:33:58,008
English.

1359
02:33:58,008 --> 02:34:00,508
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

1360
02:34:00,508 --> 02:34:02,633
I might be able to do it.

1361
02:34:04,675 --> 02:34:06,842
I mean, I might be able
to jump-start it.

1362
02:34:06,842 --> 02:34:08,217
I don't like
to break this rule,

1363
02:34:08,217 --> 02:34:10,092
but when I approach
the speed of light, I…

1364
02:34:10,092 --> 02:34:11,717
Look, crazy things
happen to time,

1365
02:34:11,717 --> 02:34:14,467
but if I do it, I create
massive electrical power.

1366
02:34:14,467 --> 02:34:16,383
I could backtrack,
if I can get enough distance,

1367
02:34:16,383 --> 02:34:18,717
I can conduct a significant
electrical current.

1368
02:34:18,717 --> 02:34:21,592
I might be able to wake
the box, if that's

1369
02:34:21,592 --> 02:34:23,383
still what we want?

1370
02:34:23,383 --> 02:34:24,883
It is. Do it.

1371
02:34:29,633 --> 02:34:31,008
Hey, Miss Lane.

1372
02:34:31,008 --> 02:34:32,050
Morning.

1373
02:34:32,050 --> 02:34:33,425
I didn't think
you were coming.

1374
02:34:34,383 --> 02:34:36,050
One last time.

1375
02:34:52,842 --> 02:34:56,883
I see engines, so this must be
the end of the line. So, I'm…

1376
02:34:56,883 --> 02:34:57,967
<i>I'm in position.</i>

1377
02:35:00,717 --> 02:35:03,383
<i>Ready to initiate
drop sequence.</i>

1378
02:35:03,383 --> 02:35:05,133
The Mother Box is ready.

1379
02:35:24,383 --> 02:35:26,342
The ship's begging me
not to wake the box.

1380
02:35:26,342 --> 02:35:27,650
<i>This action
is irreversible.</i>

1381
02:35:27,650 --> 02:35:29,717
It's afraid. It knows
Steppenwolf will come for it.

1382
02:35:29,717 --> 02:35:31,675
We know that already.
Continue.

1383
02:35:31,675 --> 02:35:34,383
<i>I strongly advise
against activation.</i>

1384
02:35:34,383 --> 02:35:36,050
Barry, I'm initiating
the countdown.

1385
02:35:36,050 --> 02:35:37,883
<i>This action
is irreversible.</i>

1386
02:35:37,883 --> 02:35:39,133
- Five…
- <i>Five…</i>

1387
02:35:39,133 --> 02:35:40,508
Five…

1380
02:35:39,133 --> 02:35:41,500
{\an8}<i>Apokoliptian technology
is hostile.</i>

1388
02:35:40,508 --> 02:35:41,500
This is a bad idea.

1389
02:35:41,500 --> 02:35:42,592
No, it isn't.
Keep going.

1390
02:35:42,592 --> 02:35:43,675
Four…

1391
02:35:43,675 --> 02:35:45,000
- <i>Four…</i>
- Four…

1392
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:46,800
{\an8}<i>I strongly advise
against activation.</i>

1393
02:35:45,800 --> 02:35:48,258
- We need to abort, now.
- Just do it.

1394
02:35:48,258 --> 02:35:49,350
- Three…
- <i>Three…</i>

1395
02:35:49,350 --> 02:35:50,508
Three…

1396
02:35:50,508 --> 02:35:52,467
- Two…
- <i>Two…</i>

1397
02:35:52,467 --> 02:35:54,342
- Two…
- <i>This course is irreversible.</i>

1398
02:35:54,342 --> 02:35:55,717
- One.
- <i>One.</i>

1399
02:35:56,717 --> 02:35:57,200
One.

1400
02:35:57,200 --> 02:35:59,660
<i>This action
is irreversible.</i>

1401
02:37:28,300 --> 02:37:30,883
- <i>Victor?</i>
- No.

1402
02:37:30,883 --> 02:37:31,967
Go?

1403
02:39:02,467 --> 02:39:05,800
<i>The future has taken
root in the present.</i>

1404
02:39:05,800 --> 02:39:07,258
Get down!

1405
02:40:51,300 --> 02:40:52,967
He's back.

1406
02:41:19,675 --> 02:41:22,633
Something's wrong.
He's scanning us.

1407
02:41:24,758 --> 02:41:26,217
What?

1408
02:41:41,133 --> 02:41:42,450
Victor?

1409
02:41:43,467 --> 02:41:44,550
Victor?

1410
02:41:46,633 --> 02:41:48,633
- Shit.
- What are you doing?

1411
02:41:48,633 --> 02:41:50,250
It's my auto-defense system.

1412
02:41:50,250 --> 02:41:51,400
It senses danger.

1413
02:41:51,400 --> 02:41:52,967
Victor, no!
Victor!

1414
02:41:52,967 --> 02:41:54,925
- I can't control it.
- Don't!

1415
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:08,550
Kal-El, no!

1416
02:42:16,675 --> 02:42:18,842
He's confused.
He doesn't know who he is.

1417
02:42:25,842 --> 02:42:28,675
Arthur,
we need to restrain him.

1418
02:42:59,008 --> 02:43:03,800
Kal-El,
the last Son of Krypton,

1419
02:43:03,800 --> 02:43:06,133
remember who you are.

1420
02:43:07,675 --> 02:43:08,967
Tell me who you…

1421
02:44:43,842 --> 02:44:45,600
Let's go!

1422
02:44:54,175 --> 02:44:55,675
You should probably move.

1423
02:44:59,008 --> 02:45:00,300
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1424
02:45:00,300 --> 02:45:03,175
Get up.
Take cover back there. Go.

1425
02:45:55,050 --> 02:45:57,258
Please don't make me do this.

1426
02:46:29,925 --> 02:46:31,133
Clark.

1427
02:46:32,092 --> 02:46:33,383
Clark, no.

1428
02:46:44,842 --> 02:46:46,258
Clark.

1429
02:46:46,258 --> 02:46:48,175
No.

1430
02:46:48,175 --> 02:46:50,050
This world needs you.

1431
02:46:55,175 --> 02:46:57,883
Clark.

1432
02:46:57,883 --> 02:46:59,925
Whoa! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

1433
02:47:01,550 --> 02:47:02,758
Clark.

1434
02:47:06,092 --> 02:47:07,550
Please.

1435
02:47:41,675 --> 02:47:42,925
Please.

1436
02:47:54,008 --> 02:47:55,258
Please.

1437
02:47:55,967 --> 02:47:58,217
Just go.

1438
02:47:58,217 --> 02:47:59,300
Yeah.

1439
02:48:00,092 --> 02:48:01,467
Let's go.

1440
02:48:33,925 --> 02:48:36,217
I'm so sorry.

1441
02:48:45,467 --> 02:48:46,550
Take cover!

1442
02:48:46,550 --> 02:48:49,217
- He's coming.
- The Mother Box.

1443
02:48:49,217 --> 02:48:50,383
Where is it?

1444
02:49:00,925 --> 02:49:02,258
Come on.

1445
02:49:03,133 --> 02:49:05,008
Come on.

1446
02:49:29,633 --> 02:49:33,200
<i>Attention,

1449
02:50:07,217 --> 02:50:08,925

02:50:22,008 --> 02:50:23,550
No, no.
No, no, no, no.

1451
02:50:26,008 --> 02:50:28,340
Dad, wait! Don't!

1452
02:51:08,050 --> 02:51:11,450
So begins the end.

1453
02:51:16,633 --> 02:51:18,092
Victor?

1454
02:51:20,342 --> 02:51:24,250
Victor. Whoa, Victor.
Are you okay, man? Come on.

1455
02:51:29,675 --> 02:51:30,925
Victor?

1456
02:51:31,925 --> 02:51:33,550
He's dead.

1457
02:51:33,550 --> 02:51:34,675
What?

1458
02:51:35,633 --> 02:51:36,967
My father.

1459
02:51:38,217 --> 02:51:42,008
I didn't save him.
I couldn't.

1460
02:51:42,008 --> 02:51:43,467
Oh, my God.

1461
02:51:50,217 --> 02:51:52,425
His father's dead
'cause of us.

1462
02:51:52,425 --> 02:51:54,200
I told you waking that box
was a bad idea.

1463
02:51:54,200 --> 02:51:55,800
It wasn't a bad idea.

1464
02:51:55,800 --> 02:51:58,400
We needed Superman.
We still do.

1465
02:51:58,400 --> 02:52:00,758
Well, whatever returned,
it isn't Superman.

1466
02:52:00,758 --> 02:52:04,008
His body and powers, maybe.
But it ain't him.

1467
02:52:04,008 --> 02:52:05,800
It is him.

1468
02:52:05,800 --> 02:52:08,258
He recognized Lois Lane.

1469
02:52:08,258 --> 02:52:10,508
- Who?
- The woman he loves.

1470
02:52:10,508 --> 02:52:13,008
- He remembers her.
- Nah.

1471
02:52:13,008 --> 02:52:15,050
He went to her 'cause
she wasn't afraid of him.

1472
02:52:15,050 --> 02:52:16,633
It's called instinct, Diana.

1473
02:52:23,800 --> 02:52:25,758
Wait,
where did Steppenwolf go?

1474
02:52:25,758 --> 02:52:27,550
He's gone back to his base

1475
02:52:27,550 --> 02:52:29,258
to assemble the three boxes.

1476
02:52:29,258 --> 02:52:30,883
And we don't know
where his base is.

1477
02:52:30,883 --> 02:52:32,592
- Or how long until…
- Hours.

1478
02:52:32,592 --> 02:52:34,342
The boxes synchronize,
Unity forms,

1479
02:52:34,342 --> 02:52:37,633
we don't get there in time
to stop it, the planet dies.

1480
02:52:37,633 --> 02:52:39,883
This is not your…

1481
02:52:41,967 --> 02:52:43,633
He knew.

1482
02:52:43,633 --> 02:52:45,450
He knew, he knew,
he knew, he knew.

1483
02:52:45,450 --> 02:52:47,217
He wasn't trying
to destroy the box,

1484
02:52:47,217 --> 02:52:49,300
he was trying to superheat it.

1485
02:52:49,300 --> 02:52:50,660
He made the core
the hottest thing

1486
02:52:50,660 --> 02:52:52,050
on Earth outside
of a nuclear reactor.

1487
02:52:52,050 --> 02:52:53,450
Now, anything that hot
would have to…

1488
02:52:53,450 --> 02:52:54,342
Blink off the charts

1489
02:52:54,342 --> 02:52:56,633
on a thermal imaging system.

1490
02:52:56,633 --> 02:53:00,133
Your father sacrificed himself
to mark that box.

1491
02:53:00,133 --> 02:53:02,258
We have to get back to my lab
and use the satellite

1492
02:53:02,258 --> 02:53:04,300
to scan the Earth
for thermal anomalies.

1493
02:53:04,300 --> 02:53:05,925
I'm already on it.

1494
02:53:05,925 --> 02:53:08,008
I'm sorry.
You have a satellite?

1495
02:53:08,008 --> 02:53:09,550
I have six.

1496
02:53:09,550 --> 02:53:10,675
Right.

1497
02:53:12,258 --> 02:53:14,700
Let's go find
the son of a bitch.

1498
02:53:38,883 --> 02:53:41,175
You brought us here.

1499
02:53:41,175 --> 02:53:43,180
You remembered.

1500
02:53:43,180 --> 02:53:45,008
This is home.

1501
02:53:46,842 --> 02:53:48,133
You spoke.

1502
02:53:52,050 --> 02:53:54,050
Did I not before?

1503
02:54:27,800 --> 02:54:30,592
Your mother got behind
on the payments.

1504
02:54:31,925 --> 02:54:34,092
She never told anyone.

1505
02:54:35,633 --> 02:54:37,550
I don't understand.

1506
02:54:40,425 --> 02:54:43,050
She's a proud woman, Clark.

1507
02:54:46,092 --> 02:54:47,550
Here.

1508
02:55:02,300 --> 02:55:04,133
She loved it here.

1509
02:55:14,842 --> 02:55:16,550
So did I.

1510
02:55:18,467 --> 02:55:20,008
So did I.

1511
02:55:45,100 --> 02:55:46,967
Wow!

1512
02:55:46,967 --> 02:55:48,675
This is awesome.

1513
02:55:48,675 --> 02:55:50,383
Brought some friends.

1514
02:55:56,800 --> 02:55:59,467
Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!

1515
02:55:59,467 --> 02:56:02,217
Everyone, this is Alfred.
I work for him.

1516
02:56:02,217 --> 02:56:04,592
- Alfred.
- Good day, ma'am.

1517
02:56:05,758 --> 02:56:07,967
Oh…

1518
02:56:10,883 --> 02:56:12,925
It's badass, Alfred.

1519
02:56:15,508 --> 02:56:18,175
Well, I'll put on the tea.

1520
02:56:18,175 --> 02:56:19,400
Great.

1521
02:56:19,400 --> 02:56:21,500
I don't know where
we're gonna find the cups.

1522
02:56:23,967 --> 02:56:26,967
There's the
Mother Box, right there.

1523
02:56:26,967 --> 02:56:29,008
Go to visible spectrum.

1524
02:56:31,580 --> 02:56:33,050
Pozharnov.

1525
02:56:33,050 --> 02:56:35,800
Ghost city
not far from Moscow.

1526
02:56:35,800 --> 02:56:37,000
It's been abandoned since

1527
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,100
the nuclear accident there
30 years ago.

1528
02:56:39,100 --> 02:56:40,383
Not even the army goes in.

1529
02:56:40,383 --> 02:56:41,800
Right, it's probably
so radioactive

1530
02:56:41,800 --> 02:56:43,800
that you grow an extra foot
outta your neck.

1531
02:56:43,800 --> 02:56:45,200
Not anymore.

1532
02:56:45,200 --> 02:56:47,550
He's harvested the radiation
to build his base.

1533
02:56:47,550 --> 02:56:48,660
Zoom.

1534
02:56:52,300 --> 02:56:53,883
What the hell is he building?

1535
02:56:53,883 --> 02:56:55,300
The Unity's in there.

1536
02:56:55,300 --> 02:56:56,800
We'll attack from above.

1537
02:56:56,800 --> 02:56:59,592
Explosives won't
separate the boxes,

1538
02:56:59,592 --> 02:57:01,400
only strengthen their bond.

1539
02:57:01,400 --> 02:57:02,883
What?
So, we can't blow it up?

1540
02:57:02,883 --> 02:57:04,550
Not from the outside.

1541
02:57:05,883 --> 02:57:09,092
I want to plug into
The Unity, one-on-one.

1542
02:57:09,092 --> 02:57:10,550
Fuse with it.

1543
02:57:10,550 --> 02:57:11,925
Weaken its bond
from the inside

1544
02:57:11,925 --> 02:57:13,383
so we can break it back
into three.

1545
02:57:13,383 --> 02:57:15,550
No, you don't know
what you'd be up against.

1546
02:57:15,550 --> 02:57:19,300
You'd have to stream
into The Unity by yourself.

1547
02:57:19,300 --> 02:57:22,100
These boxes together
are world destroyers.

1548
02:57:22,100 --> 02:57:23,550
A billion years old.

1549
02:57:23,550 --> 02:57:25,850
They'll get inside you
and find your weaknesses

1550
02:57:25,850 --> 02:57:28,133
and your fears,
and use them to destroy you.

1551
02:57:28,133 --> 02:57:30,425
Just get me in
and get me time.

1552
02:57:30,425 --> 02:57:31,675
You could die, Victor.

1553
02:57:31,675 --> 02:57:34,500
If I don't, we all die.
Period.

1554
02:57:38,800 --> 02:57:40,717
I got nothing left.

1555
02:57:45,800 --> 02:57:48,050
You wanted me
to use these gifts, right?

1556
02:57:50,967 --> 02:57:52,633
That's what I'm gonna do.

1557
02:57:52,633 --> 02:57:55,133
Okay. So,

1558
02:57:55,133 --> 02:57:56,700
if Victor wants
to try to save the world

1559
02:57:56,700 --> 02:57:58,592
by fusing
with the doom boxes,

1560
02:57:58,592 --> 02:58:01,050
I say we put him
in the doom boxes.

1561
02:58:01,050 --> 02:58:03,800
But getting him in
means attacking that base.

1562
02:58:03,800 --> 02:58:06,633
Fighting the devil
and his army

1563
02:58:06,633 --> 02:58:07,700
in hell.

1564
02:58:07,700 --> 02:58:10,200
I mean,
this guy's probably fought

1565
02:58:10,200 --> 02:58:12,467
hundreds of thousands
of other superbeings

1566
02:58:12,467 --> 02:58:14,450
on the other planets
he's destroyed, right?

1567
02:58:14,450 --> 02:58:16,100
And we have to assume
he's won.

1568
02:58:16,100 --> 02:58:17,717
I don't care how many
demons he's fought

1569
02:58:17,717 --> 02:58:19,300
in how many hells.

1570
02:58:19,300 --> 02:58:23,320
He's never fought us.
Not us united.

1571
02:59:13,217 --> 02:59:15,008
Take that as a "yes."

1572
02:59:15,008 --> 02:59:16,467
What?

1573
02:59:19,842 --> 02:59:21,133
The ring.

1574
02:59:24,717 --> 02:59:26,425
You're really back.

1575
02:59:59,717 --> 03:00:02,133
I have a second chance, Lo.

1576
03:00:04,217 --> 03:00:06,883
And I am not gonna waste it.

1577
03:01:05,008 --> 03:01:06,342
Are you really you?

1578
03:01:06,342 --> 03:01:08,717
I'm really me, Ma.

1579
03:01:26,092 --> 03:01:28,258
Listen, Ma.

1580
03:01:29,592 --> 03:01:31,883
They wanted me back
for a reason.

1581
03:01:33,508 --> 03:01:35,217
I need to find out why.

1582
03:01:55,175 --> 03:01:56,758
How's Victor doing?

1583
03:02:00,925 --> 03:02:03,883
You know,
wanted to be by himself.

1584
03:02:05,217 --> 03:02:08,508
We're asking a kid
who just lost his father

1585
03:02:08,508 --> 03:02:10,258
to go up against
the most powerful machines

1586
03:02:10,258 --> 03:02:11,592
in the universe.

1587
03:02:13,300 --> 03:02:14,967
It's not fair.

1588
03:02:16,550 --> 03:02:18,342
I thought you didn't care?

1589
03:02:19,592 --> 03:02:21,258
I never said that.

1590
03:02:34,050 --> 03:02:35,592
What is it?

1591
03:02:39,258 --> 03:02:42,950
I had a dream,
like, I don't know,

1592
03:02:42,950 --> 03:02:45,258
almost like a premonition.

1593
03:02:45,258 --> 03:02:48,217
It was the end of the world

1594
03:02:48,217 --> 03:02:51,133
and Barry Allen
was right here

1595
03:02:51,133 --> 03:02:55,300
and he said to me,
"Lois Lane is the key".

1596
03:02:57,842 --> 03:03:01,950
She is to Superman.

1597
03:03:01,950 --> 03:03:04,300
Every heart has one.

1598
03:03:04,300 --> 03:03:07,133
I think it's something more.

1599
03:03:07,133 --> 03:03:09,450
Something darker.

1600
03:03:13,175 --> 03:03:14,342
Master Wayne.

1601
03:03:14,342 --> 03:03:16,633
Master Wayne!

1602
03:03:16,633 --> 03:03:18,467
You need to see this.

1603
03:03:41,633 --> 03:03:43,508
You fixed it.

1604
03:03:43,508 --> 03:03:45,342
It wanted to fly.

1605
03:03:46,467 --> 03:03:47,967
Flight is its nature.

1606
03:03:47,967 --> 03:03:49,383
Yours, too.

1607
03:03:55,967 --> 03:03:58,133
He'll be here, Alfred,
I know it.

1608
03:03:58,133 --> 03:04:00,508
What makes you so sure?

1609
03:04:00,508 --> 03:04:03,258
Faith, Alfred. Faith.

1610
03:04:25,300 --> 03:04:26,967
At last.

1611
03:04:28,675 --> 03:04:31,800
Prepare for his arrival.

1612
03:04:33,175 --> 03:04:37,467
My redemption is nigh.

1613
03:04:45,258 --> 03:04:46,800
Unite.

1614
03:04:51,842 --> 03:04:54,467
Synchronize.

1615
03:05:38,550 --> 03:05:39,700
The satellites revealed

1616
03:05:39,700 --> 03:05:41,717
he's created a defensive dome.

1617
03:05:41,717 --> 03:05:43,050
It's a design flaw.

1618
03:05:43,050 --> 03:05:45,383
Take out the tower,
the dome will fall.

1619
03:05:45,383 --> 03:05:47,550
The enemy never anticipated
a frontal assault.

1620
03:05:47,550 --> 03:05:49,258
Right, probably
'cause he didn't think

1621
03:05:49,258 --> 03:05:51,342
anyone would be that nuts.

1622
03:05:52,217 --> 03:05:53,550
Bruce is right.

1623
03:05:53,550 --> 03:05:55,258
We've got to destroy
the defensive dome,

1624
03:05:55,258 --> 03:05:57,758
so we can reach The Unity
before it synchronizes.

1625
03:05:57,758 --> 03:05:59,758
What if the dome's
not destroyed?

1626
03:05:59,758 --> 03:06:00,900
It'll be destroyed.

1627
03:06:00,900 --> 03:06:03,050
Once Victor is linked
with The Unity

1628
03:06:03,050 --> 03:06:04,425
with Barry's help,

1629
03:06:04,425 --> 03:06:06,450
he'll break through
The Unity's defenses.

1630
03:06:06,450 --> 03:06:08,050
Remind me,
how's that again?

1631
03:06:08,050 --> 03:06:09,592
Uh, with the power of love.

1632
03:06:09,592 --> 03:06:12,717
- Barry.
- With a catastrophic energy surge.

1633
03:06:12,717 --> 03:06:14,000
Good.

1634
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:16,008
You'll have to run faster
than you've ever attempted

1635
03:06:16,008 --> 03:06:18,425
to generate
a charge of that size.

1636
03:06:18,425 --> 03:06:20,758
And then you make
physical contact with Victor.

1637
03:06:20,758 --> 03:06:23,842
That force should propel him
inside The Unity.

1638
03:06:23,842 --> 03:06:25,842
And, Victor,
it's all up to you.

1639
03:06:25,842 --> 03:06:29,300
Take it apart from the inside
before it synchronizes.

1640
03:06:29,300 --> 03:06:33,008
Whew. We actually
finally have a plan.

1641
03:06:33,008 --> 03:06:34,883
We have a plan.

1642
03:06:49,925 --> 03:06:52,250
<i>The symbol of
the house of El means hope.</i>

1643
03:06:52,250 --> 03:06:54,425
<i>Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief</i>

1644
03:06:54,425 --> 03:06:58,467
<i>in the potential of every
person to be a force for good.</i>

1645
03:06:58,467 --> 03:06:59,550
<i>Clark…</i>

1646
03:06:59,550 --> 03:07:01,000
<i>That's what
you can bring them.</i>

1647
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:03,200
<i>…you were
sent here for a reason.</i>

1648
03:07:03,200 --> 03:07:04,750
<i>You will give
the people of Earth</i>

1649
03:07:04,750 --> 03:07:07,400
<i>an ideal to strive towards.</i>

1650
03:07:07,400 --> 03:07:08,800
<i>And even if it takes you</i>

1651
03:07:08,800 --> 03:07:09,700
<i>the rest of your life,</i>

1652
03:07:09,700 --> 03:07:13,425
<i>you owe it to yourself to
find out what that reason is.</i>

1653
03:07:13,425 --> 03:07:16,175
<i>They will stumble,
they will fall.</i>

1654
03:07:16,175 --> 03:07:18,342
<i>You're gonna
have to make a choice.</i>

1655
03:07:18,342 --> 03:07:20,883
<i>They will join you
in the sun, Kal.</i>

1656
03:07:20,883 --> 03:07:22,700
<i>A choice of whether
to stand proud</i>

1657
03:07:22,700 --> 03:07:25,008
<i>in front of the human race
or not.</i>

1658
03:07:25,008 --> 03:07:28,508
<i>You will help them
accomplish wonders.</i>

1659
03:07:45,300 --> 03:07:50,050
<i>All the hopes and dreams
of Krypton live in you now.</i>

1660
03:07:50,050 --> 03:07:53,530
<i>I'm so proud of you, son.</i>

1661
03:07:53,530 --> 03:07:56,550
<i>Your mother and I
loved you.</i>

1662
03:07:56,550 --> 03:07:57,650
<i>Your mother and I knew</i>

1663
03:07:57,650 --> 03:08:00,175
<i>you would change the world.</i>

1664
03:08:01,258 --> 03:08:04,300
<i>Your heart was tested.</i>

1665
03:08:04,300 --> 03:08:07,008
<i>I know
it's been hard, Clark.</i>

1666
03:08:07,008 --> 03:08:10,050
<i>But you gave hope
to their world.</i>

1667
03:08:10,050 --> 03:08:13,592
<i>You need to show them
who you are.</i>

1668
03:08:13,592 --> 03:08:15,883
<i>Love them, Kal.</i>

1669
03:08:15,883 --> 03:08:18,217
<i>The way we loved you.</i>

1670
03:08:20,508 --> 03:08:22,550
<i>Fly, son.</i>

1671
03:08:22,550 --> 03:08:24,050
<i>It's time.</i>

1672
03:09:27,633 --> 03:09:28,850
I'm gonna take out
that tower

1673
03:09:28,850 --> 03:09:31,008
and knock down
that shield dome.

1674
03:09:31,008 --> 03:09:33,467
Whatever you see,

1675
03:09:33,467 --> 03:09:35,550
stick to the plan.

1676
03:09:37,217 --> 03:09:39,700
It's why
I brought you together.

1677
03:10:19,175 --> 03:10:21,175
Bruce, pull back.
You're not gonna make it.

1678
03:10:24,600 --> 03:10:27,008
Just have to knock
a little louder.

1679
03:10:51,883 --> 03:10:53,508
Kill him!

1680
03:10:53,508 --> 03:10:56,508
Get to the carriage.
Defend The Unity.

1681
03:11:01,300 --> 03:11:02,550
Oh, shit.

1682
03:11:22,633 --> 03:11:23,967
The tower's down.

1683
03:11:25,467 --> 03:11:27,000
Do you read me?

1684
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:29,633
Uh, yeah,
loud and clear.

1685
03:11:29,633 --> 03:11:31,217
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1686
03:11:32,300 --> 03:11:35,175
<i>Bruce? Bruce?</i>

1687
03:11:35,175 --> 03:11:36,342
Get to the reactor.

1688
03:11:36,342 --> 03:11:37,500
I'll lure as many
of these monsters

1689
03:11:37,500 --> 03:11:39,883
- away from you as I can.
- What does that mean?

1690
03:11:42,633 --> 03:11:44,990
Don't worry about me.
Get to The Unity.

1691
03:11:47,425 --> 03:11:48,990
They're here.

1692
03:11:48,990 --> 03:11:50,300
<i>Bruce?</i>

1693
03:11:52,758 --> 03:11:54,217
Comm went dead.

1694
03:11:55,842 --> 03:11:57,175
Let's go.

1695
03:12:35,842 --> 03:12:37,925
Come on, follow me,
you damn insects.

1696
03:13:57,633 --> 03:13:59,050
<i>Critical damage.</i>

1697
03:14:38,842 --> 03:14:40,300
You really are
outta your mind.

1698
03:15:07,092 --> 03:15:08,425
You're welcome.

1699
03:15:08,425 --> 03:15:10,050
My man.

1700
03:16:42,717 --> 03:16:44,508
Yeah, we got this.

1701
03:16:44,508 --> 03:16:45,925
You go do your thing.

1702
03:17:41,717 --> 03:17:43,383
I'm assuming you're Alfred.

1703
03:17:45,133 --> 03:17:46,800
Master Kent.

1704
03:17:48,150 --> 03:17:50,092
He said you'd come.

1705
03:17:51,550 --> 03:17:55,217
Now, let's hope
you're not too late.

1706
03:18:05,842 --> 03:18:08,342
Hey!

1707
03:18:16,342 --> 03:18:17,800
Remember me?

1708
03:18:20,217 --> 03:18:22,342
Round two?

1709
03:18:22,342 --> 03:18:23,633
Hell yeah.

1710
03:18:45,008 --> 03:18:46,508
Shall we?

1711
03:18:47,342 --> 03:18:49,675
Tell me, Amazon,

1712
03:18:49,675 --> 03:18:53,842
why did you
abandon your own sisters

1713
03:18:53,842 --> 03:18:56,592
only to cast your lot
with these creatures

1714
03:18:56,592 --> 03:19:00,008
clinging to their puny lives?

1715
03:19:00,008 --> 03:19:03,175
You weren't there
to protect them from me.

1716
03:19:03,175 --> 03:19:05,300
And, sadly, you could have.

1717
03:19:46,175 --> 03:19:48,050
Barry, I'm in position.

1718
03:20:06,592 --> 03:20:09,967
Okay.
I built the charge.

1719
03:20:09,967 --> 03:20:11,133
<i>You call it.</i>

1720
03:20:12,258 --> 03:20:14,175
Barry, on one.

1721
03:20:14,175 --> 03:20:16,467
Three, two…

1722
03:20:19,300 --> 03:20:21,258
Get the hell off me!

1723
03:20:21,258 --> 03:20:22,675
Victor!

1724
03:20:58,633 --> 03:21:00,300
Victor!

1725
03:21:03,967 --> 03:21:06,550
I watched your island burn,

1726
03:21:06,550 --> 03:21:10,258
your sisters
begging for their lives.

1727
03:21:10,258 --> 03:21:12,850
As did your mother.

1728
03:21:12,850 --> 03:21:14,050
Liar.

1729
03:21:39,592 --> 03:21:42,550
I can't maintain this!

1730
03:21:42,550 --> 03:21:44,370
Victor!

1731
03:22:05,717 --> 03:22:08,008
Victor, I can't hold this!

1732
03:22:14,633 --> 03:22:17,008
For Darkseid.

1733
03:22:20,842 --> 03:22:23,342
Not impressed.

1734
03:23:07,800 --> 03:23:09,092
All right.

1735
03:23:09,092 --> 03:23:10,758
Kal-El.

1736
03:23:49,050 --> 03:23:51,467
Barry, I'm connected
to The Unity.

1737
03:23:51,467 --> 03:23:53,633
I need the charge
to get inside.

1738
03:24:15,592 --> 03:24:17,425
Barry?

1739
03:24:17,425 --> 03:24:19,258
Barry, are you okay?

1740
03:24:20,675 --> 03:24:21,650
<i>Barry!</i>

1741
03:24:21,650 --> 03:24:23,217
I got the wind
knocked out of me.

1742
03:24:23,217 --> 03:24:25,925
Need a few seconds,
that's all!

1743
03:24:42,300 --> 03:24:45,550
Barry, where are you?
It's almost synchronized!

1744
03:24:45,550 --> 03:24:47,508
Okay, okay.

1745
03:24:47,508 --> 03:24:50,467
Oh, my God.
Gotta heal, Barry.

1746
03:24:50,467 --> 03:24:52,258
Heal. Heal.

1747
03:25:18,008 --> 03:25:19,675
Barry!

1748
03:25:32,467 --> 03:25:34,300
It's too late.

1749
03:25:35,550 --> 03:25:37,050
Oh, no.

1750
03:25:41,133 --> 03:25:42,925
He's here!

1751
03:26:12,300 --> 03:26:13,350
Okay.

1752
03:26:13,350 --> 03:26:14,800
Just gotta go faster
than the speed of light.

1753
03:26:14,800 --> 03:26:15,967
Far beyond the speed of light.

1754
03:26:15,967 --> 03:26:16,900
You gotta break the rule,
Barry,

1755
03:26:16,900 --> 03:26:19,425
and you gotta do it now.

1756
03:26:32,300 --> 03:26:34,217
Dad,

1757
03:26:37,842 --> 03:26:40,383
whatever happens,
I want you to know

1758
03:26:42,883 --> 03:26:45,092
your kid was one of them, Dad.

1759
03:26:48,133 --> 03:26:50,217
One of the best of the best.

1760
03:27:45,467 --> 03:27:48,175
Make your own future.

1761
03:27:54,467 --> 03:27:56,592
Make your own past.

1762
03:28:01,092 --> 03:28:04,758
It's all right now.

1763
03:28:51,592 --> 03:28:53,967
We've been waiting
for you, Victor.

1764
03:28:54,967 --> 03:28:57,175
My broken boy.

1765
03:28:59,342 --> 03:29:01,633
You don't have to be
alone anymore.

1766
03:29:01,633 --> 03:29:03,425
We'll be together again.

1767
03:29:10,967 --> 03:29:13,342
we can put it back, Vic.

1768
03:29:17,508 --> 03:29:19,800
Make you whole again.

1769
03:29:31,508 --> 03:29:33,425
I'm not broken.

1770
03:29:43,008 --> 03:29:45,008
And I'm not alone.

1771
03:30:01,675 --> 03:30:02,842
Superman!

1772
03:31:33,383 --> 03:31:35,467
I told you

1773
03:31:36,883 --> 03:31:39,675
Steppenwolf would fail.

1774
03:31:40,467 --> 03:31:44,300
Yes. Yes, you did.

1775
03:31:44,842 --> 03:31:46,175
My master,

1776
03:31:46,175 --> 03:31:50,092
now that the Mother Boxes
have been destroyed,

1777
03:31:50,092 --> 03:31:54,133
how will you retrieve
your great prize?

1778
03:31:54,133 --> 03:31:57,675
Anti-Life is found, DeSaad.

1779
03:31:57,675 --> 03:32:02,592
And we will stop
at nothing to possess it.

1780
03:32:05,633 --> 03:32:07,258
Ready the armada.

1781
03:32:08,008 --> 03:32:10,633
We will use the old ways.

1782
03:34:34,675 --> 03:34:37,092
<i>Your father twice over.</i>

1783
03:34:44,133 --> 03:34:46,758
<i>Now, let me speak to you
from my heart,</i>

1784
03:34:46,758 --> 03:34:48,758
<i>not as a scientist,</i>

1785
03:34:48,758 --> 03:34:50,467
<i>as a father.</i>

1786
03:34:51,460 --> 03:34:54,100
<i>Your father twice over.</i>

1787
03:34:56,092 --> 03:34:59,633
<i>I brought you into the world
and back to it.</i>

1788
03:34:59,633 --> 03:35:04,008
<i>You can't imagine how proud
I am of who you are.</i>

1789
03:35:04,008 --> 03:35:05,990
<i>Have always been.</i>

1790
03:35:07,400 --> 03:35:09,020
<i>So many years
with you I wasted.</i>

1791
03:35:09,020 --> 03:35:12,800
<i>So many wrongs
I've left un-righted.</i>

1792
03:35:15,050 --> 03:35:17,550
<i>Everything breaks, Victor.</i>

1793
03:35:17,550 --> 03:35:20,300
<i>Everything changes.</i>

1794
03:35:30,467 --> 03:35:32,717
I gotta go see my father.

1795
03:36:08,092 --> 03:36:10,217
<i>The world is hurt.</i>

1796
03:36:10,217 --> 03:36:11,383
<i>Broken.</i>

1797
03:36:11,383 --> 03:36:13,883
<i>Unexchangeable.</i>

1798
03:36:13,883 --> 03:36:15,758
Ship's
all yours now, kid.

1799
03:36:15,758 --> 03:36:17,217
You're the boss.

1800
03:36:19,258 --> 03:36:22,758
"Ryan Choi,
Director of Nanotechnology."

1801
03:36:22,758 --> 03:36:24,383
That's your thing.

1802
03:36:24,925 --> 03:36:26,925
Uh, yep.

1803
03:36:26,925 --> 03:36:28,633
That's my thing.

1804
03:36:33,383 --> 03:36:37,717
<i>But the world's
not fixed in the past,</i>

1805
03:36:37,717 --> 03:36:39,008
<i>only the future.</i>

1806
03:36:40,717 --> 03:36:44,675
<i>The not yet.
The now.</i>

1807
03:36:44,675 --> 03:36:48,342
Wow.
Must be 100, 150 feet.

1808
03:36:48,342 --> 03:36:49,800
Must be.

1809
03:36:50,800 --> 03:36:52,592
Big round table.

1810
03:36:52,592 --> 03:36:54,883
Six chairs, right there.

1811
03:36:55,883 --> 03:36:57,633
But room for more.

1812
03:36:59,925 --> 03:37:01,717
But room for more.

1813
03:37:02,592 --> 03:37:04,425
God help us.

1814
03:37:06,092 --> 03:37:08,800
<i>The now is you.</i>

1815
03:37:11,883 --> 03:37:13,425
What?

1816
03:37:13,425 --> 03:37:16,258
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.

1817
03:37:16,258 --> 03:37:18,842
But, uh,
my foot's in the door.

1818
03:37:18,842 --> 03:37:20,592
This is like a "job" job?

1819
03:37:21,300 --> 03:37:22,508
"Job" job.

1820
03:37:25,967 --> 03:37:28,758
Your foot's in the door.

1821
03:37:30,883 --> 03:37:32,217
Isn't that a thing people say?

1822
03:37:32,217 --> 03:37:34,217
Your foot's in the door.

1823
03:37:34,217 --> 03:37:36,633
Yeah, that's something
people say, man.

1824
03:37:36,633 --> 03:37:38,300
His foot's in the door!

1825
03:37:38,300 --> 03:37:41,175
- That's my boy, right there!
- Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

1826
03:37:41,175 --> 03:37:42,550
Taught him nothing he knows.

1827
03:37:42,550 --> 03:37:43,800
- Yes!
- Dad, you're gonna

1828
03:37:43,800 --> 03:37:44,925
get maced again.

1829
03:37:48,217 --> 03:37:50,092
No stopping you now.

1830
03:37:52,133 --> 03:37:53,508
Thanks, Dad.

1831
03:37:53,508 --> 03:37:54,842
<i>Now.</i>

1832
03:37:54,842 --> 03:37:57,967
<i>Now's your time, Victor,
to rise.</i>

1833
03:37:57,967 --> 03:38:01,092
"Thank you" is not enough
for what you did.

1834
03:38:01,092 --> 03:38:04,717
I just undid a mistake,
that's all.

1835
03:38:14,842 --> 03:38:17,883
How did you get the house
back from the bank?

1836
03:38:17,883 --> 03:38:20,050
I bought the bank.

1837
03:38:22,300 --> 03:38:24,967
Congratulations, by the way.

1838
03:38:24,967 --> 03:38:26,758
<i>Do this. Be this.</i>

1839
03:38:26,758 --> 03:38:32,092
<i>The man I never was.
The hero you are.</i>

1840
03:38:32,092 --> 03:38:34,508
<i>Take your place
among the brave ones.</i>

1841
03:38:34,508 --> 03:38:39,633
<i>The ones that were, that are,
that are yet to be.</i>

1842
03:39:12,258 --> 03:39:15,342
<i>It's time you stand,</i>

1843
03:39:19,008 --> 03:39:20,592
<i>fight,</i>

1844
03:39:23,092 --> 03:39:24,830
<i>discover,</i>

1845
03:39:29,258 --> 03:39:31,467
<i>heal, love,</i>

1846
03:39:34,925 --> 03:39:36,690
<i>win.</i>

1847
03:40:02,592 --> 03:40:04,467
<i>The time</i>

1848
03:40:04,467 --> 03:40:05,967
<i>is now.</i>

1849
03:40:14,967 --> 03:40:16,425
Ready?

1850
03:40:16,425 --> 03:40:17,880
Come on, Stevens.

1851
03:40:21,342 --> 03:40:22,758
All right,
let's keep it moving.

1852
03:40:24,550 --> 03:40:25,800
Keep going.

1853
03:40:27,300 --> 03:40:29,383
Come on, Luthor.
Let's go.

1854
03:40:32,967 --> 03:40:34,175
Luthor.

1855
03:40:39,008 --> 03:40:40,770
Open up two, Carl, please.

1856
03:40:49,217 --> 03:40:50,633
Luthor.

1857
03:40:55,425 --> 03:40:56,900
All right,
stop jerking around, Luthor,

1858
03:40:56,900 --> 03:40:58,883
or I'm gonna
have to come in there.

1859
03:42:27,383 --> 03:42:30,092
Ah, there he is.

1860
03:42:30,092 --> 03:42:31,342
Welcome aboard.

1861
03:42:31,342 --> 03:42:33,342
Care for a glass
of Gout de Diamants?

1862
03:42:33,342 --> 03:42:35,383
I was just celebrating
God's return.

1863
03:42:35,383 --> 03:42:37,925
Out of the ground
and back up into the sky.

1864
03:42:37,925 --> 03:42:40,592
I heard you were
a few clowns short of a circus.

1865
03:42:40,990 --> 03:42:42,300
I was, thank you,

1866
03:42:42,300 --> 03:42:44,450
until the good doctors
at Arkham helped me

1867
03:42:44,450 --> 03:42:46,800
find some much needed clarity.

1868
03:42:46,800 --> 03:42:49,217
Now, you volunteered
to destroy the bat

1869
03:42:49,217 --> 03:42:50,342
free of charge.

1870
03:42:50,342 --> 03:42:52,217
Why the pro bono work?

1871
03:42:52,217 --> 03:42:54,300
It's personal.

1872
03:42:54,300 --> 03:42:57,300
Let me guess,
an eye for an eye?

1873
03:42:59,133 --> 03:43:01,008
You said you had something
I'd want?

1874
03:43:01,008 --> 03:43:02,508
You'd better not be
wasting my time.

1875
03:43:02,508 --> 03:43:04,800
Ooh. And endure
your wrath, Mr. Wilson?

1876
03:43:04,800 --> 03:43:06,500
No, I wouldn't think of it.

1877
03:43:06,500 --> 03:43:08,133
I have too much
to live for.

1878
03:43:08,133 --> 03:43:11,300
And more important things
to do.

1879
03:43:11,300 --> 03:43:14,842
But if you want the Batman,

1880
03:43:14,842 --> 03:43:18,217
here is something
that can help you.

1881
03:43:19,383 --> 03:43:23,675
His name is Bruce Wayne.

1882
03:43:26,717 --> 03:43:29,300
Hmm. On second thought,

1883
03:43:31,383 --> 03:43:33,550
we do have something
to celebrate.

1884
03:43:34,592 --> 03:43:36,092
Good boy.

1885
03:44:40,342 --> 03:44:41,633
Clear.

1886
03:44:47,008 --> 03:44:48,633
How much further?

1887
03:44:49,758 --> 03:44:51,092
We're almost there.

1888
03:44:53,175 --> 03:44:54,758
Well, we need to hurry.

1889
03:44:54,758 --> 03:44:56,592
We can't be out in the open
much longer.

1890
03:44:56,592 --> 03:44:58,342
He'll come for us.

1891
03:45:01,133 --> 03:45:03,258
Let him come.

1892
03:45:03,258 --> 03:45:05,050
Let the bastard come.

1893
03:45:06,258 --> 03:45:08,508
I'll stab this
through his heart

1894
03:45:08,508 --> 03:45:10,925
for what he did to Arthur.

1895
03:45:10,925 --> 03:45:13,008
I want to make him pay.

1896
03:45:14,467 --> 03:45:17,300
I understand
how you feel, Mera.

1897
03:45:17,300 --> 03:45:20,300
You have no idea how I feel.

1898
03:45:20,300 --> 03:45:22,050
But we have to
stick to the plan

1899
03:45:22,050 --> 03:45:24,675
to have any chance
to make this right.

1900
03:45:32,467 --> 03:45:36,008
Who have you ever loved?

1901
03:45:49,842 --> 03:45:53,300
<i>Au contraire,</i>
my little fish stick.

1902
03:45:56,842 --> 03:45:58,450
He knows exactly
what it's like

1903
03:45:58,450 --> 03:46:00,800
to lose someone he loves.

1904
03:46:02,342 --> 03:46:04,717
You know, like, uh,

1905
03:46:05,967 --> 03:46:07,425
a father,

1906
03:46:08,758 --> 03:46:10,925
like a mother.

1907
03:46:10,925 --> 03:46:14,258
Be very careful
with the next thing you say.

1908
03:46:15,758 --> 03:46:17,925
Like an adopted son.

1909
03:46:21,550 --> 03:46:24,717
Isn't that right,

1910
03:46:24,717 --> 03:46:26,300
Batman?

1911
03:46:29,425 --> 03:46:30,800
Maybe, in a way,

1912
03:46:30,800 --> 03:46:33,220
that smelly
old flounder is right.

1913
03:46:34,342 --> 03:46:37,110
Because how many
can die in your arms

1914
03:46:37,110 --> 03:46:39,480
before you grow numb to death?

1915
03:46:40,342 --> 03:46:43,383
That's not very careful.

1916
03:46:43,383 --> 03:46:47,217
And how many dead eyes
can you look into

1917
03:46:47,217 --> 03:46:50,133
before you die inside
yourself?

1918
03:46:50,133 --> 03:46:54,050
I've been dead inside
a long time,

1919
03:46:54,050 --> 03:46:56,008
but even I have a limit.

1920
03:46:56,008 --> 03:46:58,008
And if you cross that line,
I swear to God, I will…

1921
03:46:58,008 --> 03:47:01,050
Before what, Bruce?
Kill me?

1922
03:47:01,050 --> 03:47:03,717
You won't kill me.

1923
03:47:03,717 --> 03:47:05,967
I'm your best friend.

1924
03:47:05,967 --> 03:47:10,342
Besides, who's gonna give you
a reach-around?

1925
03:47:12,217 --> 03:47:14,883
Anyway,

1926
03:47:14,883 --> 03:47:16,880
you need me.

1927
03:47:17,508 --> 03:47:19,383
You

1928
03:47:19,383 --> 03:47:22,280
need me to help you
undo this world

1929
03:47:22,280 --> 03:47:25,300
you created
by letting her die.

1930
03:47:27,758 --> 03:47:29,758
Poor Lois.

1931
03:47:29,758 --> 03:47:32,717
How she suffered so!

1932
03:47:38,467 --> 03:47:40,800
I often wonder

1933
03:47:40,800 --> 03:47:42,717
how many
alternate timelines

1934
03:47:42,717 --> 03:47:46,133
do you destroy
the world because,

1935
03:47:46,133 --> 03:47:47,600
frankly, you don't have

1936
03:47:47,600 --> 03:47:50,467
the cojones to die yourself.

1937
03:47:51,383 --> 03:47:52,883
Hmm?

1938
03:47:54,925 --> 03:47:56,217
So, as usual,

1939
03:47:56,217 --> 03:47:59,300
I'll be the bigger man.

1940
03:48:02,592 --> 03:48:04,883
A truce,

1941
03:48:04,883 --> 03:48:06,633
Bruce.

1942
03:48:08,800 --> 03:48:13,430
As long as you
have this card, a truce.

1943
03:48:16,008 --> 03:48:17,133
But all you have to do

1944
03:48:17,133 --> 03:48:18,050
is tear it in half

1945
03:48:18,050 --> 03:48:19,400
and I'm happy
to discuss with you

1946
03:48:19,400 --> 03:48:22,550
in any way you like,
why you sent the Boy Wonder

1947
03:48:24,133 --> 03:48:26,133
to do a man's job?

1948
03:48:29,383 --> 03:48:31,300
You know, it's funny

1949
03:48:31,300 --> 03:48:32,500
that you would talk
about people

1950
03:48:32,500 --> 03:48:34,467
who died in my arms

1951
03:48:34,467 --> 03:48:36,342
because when I held
Harley Quinn

1952
03:48:36,342 --> 03:48:38,967
and she was bleeding
and dying,

1953
03:48:38,967 --> 03:48:42,758
she begged me
with her last breath

1954
03:48:42,758 --> 03:48:45,050
that when I killed you,

1955
03:48:45,050 --> 03:48:48,800
and make no mistake,
I will fucking kill you,

1956
03:48:48,800 --> 03:48:50,800
that I'd do it slow.

1957
03:48:51,842 --> 03:48:53,967
I'm gonna honor that promise.

1958
03:49:24,200 --> 03:49:27,300
Oh. You're good.

1959
03:49:31,508 --> 03:49:33,550
You almost had me.

1960
03:49:52,508 --> 03:49:53,717
Where are we holding up?

1961
03:49:53,717 --> 03:49:56,342
Somewhere he'll never suspect.

1962
03:49:56,342 --> 03:49:59,990
Still think it was a good idea
bringing him along?

1963
03:49:59,990 --> 03:50:02,470
What do you think?

1964
03:50:08,133 --> 03:50:09,550
He's found us.

1965
03:51:38,342 --> 03:51:40,967
Can I help you?

1966
03:51:40,967 --> 03:51:44,675
I'm sure you know Darkseid
is not finished with Earth.

1967
03:51:44,675 --> 03:51:47,883
The Anti-Life Equation
is here somewhere.

1968
03:51:47,883 --> 03:51:50,925
We have to find it
before he does.

1969
03:51:50,925 --> 03:51:52,925
There's a war coming.

1970
03:51:52,925 --> 03:51:54,842
And I'm here to help.

1971
03:51:54,842 --> 03:51:57,258
I'm sorry,
who are you again?

1972
03:51:57,258 --> 03:51:59,467
I've gone by many names

1973
03:51:59,467 --> 03:52:02,842
and taken many forms.
And like you,

1974
03:52:02,842 --> 03:52:05,675
I've realized I have
a stake in this world

1975
03:52:05,675 --> 03:52:08,383
and it's time
I started fighting for it.

1976
03:52:09,050 --> 03:52:10,258
Oh.

1977
03:52:11,675 --> 03:52:14,092
Well, we could
definitely use the help.

1978
03:52:14,092 --> 03:52:17,508
So, glad you're here.

1979
03:52:18,592 --> 03:52:19,400
You know, I never thought

1980
03:52:19,400 --> 03:52:20,883
I'd see
the defenders of Earth

1981
03:52:20,883 --> 03:52:23,967
united and fighting as one.

1982
03:52:23,967 --> 03:52:26,633
It wouldn't have happened
without you, Bruce.

1983
03:52:27,842 --> 03:52:30,467
Your mother and father
would be proud.

1984
03:52:31,717 --> 03:52:33,008
I hope so.

1985
03:52:38,883 --> 03:52:42,883
Well, I'll be in touch.

1986
03:52:42,883 --> 03:52:47,092
Oh, and some have called me

1987
03:52:47,092 --> 03:52:49,990
the Martian Manhunter.

1988
03:52:57,050 --> 03:52:59,633
I guess I'll see you around.
