1
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,537
(Breathing heavily)

2
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:17,054
(Cawing)

3
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,421
(Dogs barking)

4
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,451
You're wearing a black cloak again.

5
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,204
I've been sent to negotiate with you.

6
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,819
It appears my trusting nature
got the better of me.

7
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,196
It's happened before.

8
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,867
I was hoping your onalty was real
when you pledged yourself to us, Jon snow.

9
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,702
Truly, I was.

10
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,579
The halfhand ordered me to join your army

11
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,373
and bring back whatever information
I could to castle black.

12
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,917
He made me kill him so you'd trust me.

13
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,586
I was onal

14
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,130
to him and to my night's watch vows.

15
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,007
All your vows?

16
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:23,013
She wasn't enough to turn you, eh?

17
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,056
Were you enough to turn her?

18
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,811
She put three arrows in me when I escaped.

19
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,523
Did you see her again at castle black?

20
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,066
Yes.

21
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,735
And?

22
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:38,862
She's dead.

23
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,198
Your doing?

24
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,787
We'll drink to her.

25
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,689
Of all the ways I'd kill you,
poison would be the last.

26
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,403
- Ygritte.
- Ygritte.

27
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,243
(Coughing)

28
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,956
That's not wine.

29
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,000
No, it's a proper northern drink, Jon snow.

30
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,337
You did well. Fought hard.

31
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,173
Killed some of our strongest men.

32
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:44,803
One of our giants went into your tunnel
and never came out again.

33
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,304
Mag the mighty.

34
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,348
He's dead.

35
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,600
He killed my friend grenn.

36
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,018
Mance: He was their king.

37
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,939
The last of a bloodline that stretches back
before the first men.

38
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,441
Grenn came from a farm.

39
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,615
- Mag and grenn.
- Grenn and mag.

40
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,121
Mance: Kullback, could I trouble you
for something to eat?

41
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,792
I don't imagine our guest has
eaten anything for quite some time.

42
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:21,131
So, you're here to strike a bargain?

43
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,926
Turn your army around and go home.

44
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,845
Mance: You know I know
you're low on arrows,

45
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,306
you're low on oil, you're low on men.

46
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,182
How many are left, 50?

47
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,560
I told tormund and orell.

48
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,103
We have more than 1,000 men.

49
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,648
I showed you everything I had.
The whole army, 100,000 strong.

50
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,277
And what did you do?
You fired on us with everything you had.

51
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,445
It wasn't much.

52
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:47,991
As soon as I saw that,
I sent 400 men to climb the wall,

53
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,577
an unmanned stretch
five miles west of here.

54
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,287
A lot of them will die climbing,

55
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,497
but most of them will be over
by the end of the day.

56
00:06:55,165 --> 00:07:00,170
It's me being honest with you, Jon snow,
which is more than you've ever done for me.

57
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,631
My people have bled enough.

58
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:03,840
We're not here to conquer.

59
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:08,094
We're here to hide behind your wall.
Just like you.

60
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,555
We need your tunnel.

61
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,768
Now we both know that winter is coming.

62
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,104
And if my people aren't south of the wall
when it comes in earnest,

63
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,023
we'll all end up worse than dead.

64
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,736
You want to strike a bargain with me?
Here's the bargain.

65
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,905
You go back, you open the gates to us,

66
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,283
and I swear to you
that no one else will die.

67
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,577
Refuse,

68
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,205
and we'll kill every last
man at castle black.

69
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,667
- (Unsheathing)
- Ahl

70
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,465
That's why you're here.

71
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,552
I reckon you could do it
before any of them could stop you.

72
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,388
They'd kill you, of course.

73
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,681
They'd kill you slow.

74
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:56,476
But you knew that when you came in here.

75
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,772
Are you capable of that, Jon snow?

76
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,275
Killing a man in his own tent
when he's just offered you peace?

77
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,194
Is that what the night's watch is?

78
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,239
Is that what you are?

79
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,474
- (Horn blows)
- Man: Riders coming!

80
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,621
- Are you attacking us?
- No.

81
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,249
It's like you said, we don't have the men.

82
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,333
(Horn blowing)

83
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,793
(Dogs barking)

84
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,048
(Men yelling)

85
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,445
Hold! To me! To me!

86
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,716
(Yelling)

87
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,488
(Chaotic shouting)

88
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,555
(Screaming)

89
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,936
Stand down!

90
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,981
I said my people have bled enough,

91
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,067
and I meant it.

92
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,117
(Men screaming)

93
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,055
(Shouting)

94
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,894
Man: Round them up.

95
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,563
Stay with the horses.

96
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,449
You're the king-beyond-the-wall?

97
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,997
- Do you know who I am?
- Never had the pleasure.

98
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,083
This is Stannis Baratheon,
the one true king of the seven kingdoms.

99
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:11,004
We're not in the seven kingdoms,
and you're not dressed for this weather.

100
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,465
It is customary to kneel
when surrendering to a king.

101
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,057
We do not kneel.

102
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,077
I'll have thousands of your men
in chains by nightfall,

103
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,687
have nowhere to put them,
have nothing to feed them.

104
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,857
I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs.

105
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,485
Their fate depends on their king.

106
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:38,573
All the same, we do not kneel.

107
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,619
Take these men away.

108
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,207
What's a man of the night's watch
doing in a wildling camp?

109
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,835
I was sent to discuss terms
with the king-beyond-the-wall.

110
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,254
You're speaking to the one true king, boy.

111
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,131
You will address him as "your grace."

112
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,218
I know he's the king.
My father died for him.

113
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,139
My name is Jon snow, your grace.

114
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,225
I'm ned stark's son.

115
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,396
Your father was an honourable man.

116
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,357
He was, your grace.

117
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,317
What do you think he'd have done with him?

118
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,368
I was this man's prisoner once.

119
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,537
He could have tortured me.
He could have killed me.

120
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,666
But he spared my life.

121
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,960
I think my father would
have taken him prisoner,

122
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,753
listened to what he had to say.

123
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,842
Very well, then. Take him.

124
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,100
Your grace.

125
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,895
If my father had seen
the things that I've seen,

126
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,857
he'd also tell you to
burn the dead before nightfall.

127
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:56,985
All of them.

128
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,076
(Flies buzzing)

129
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,539
I would suggest milk of the poppy
to ease his pain,

130
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,417
- but he is completely insensate.
- Bloody martells.

131
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,711
Pycelle: The cause
appears to be manticore venom.

132
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,839
It is. The death's head manticore.

133
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:22,844
I've read a great deal about it.
It's a horrible poison.

134
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,471
- Usually mantari in origin.
- (Squishing)

135
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,557
Oh!

136
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,850
There's nothing to be done.

137
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,143
Yes, there is.

138
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,731
May I ask what you think you're doing?

139
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,857
Saving him.

140
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,528
Pycelle: Your grace, I wish it were
othennise, but ser Gregor is beyond saving.

141
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,114
Well, well beyond.

142
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:47,618
This man is not even a maester,
let alone grand maester.

143
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,788
That's for the best.
No maester knows how to save him.

144
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,999
That is exactly the sort of arrogance

145
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,918
that had him expelled
from the citadel, your grace.

146
00:13:56,002 --> 00:14:00,298
His curiosity was deemed
dangerous and unnatural.

147
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,091
Rightly so, in my opinion.

148
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,427
You're dismissed, grand maester.

149
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:10,183
(Stammering)
But, your grace, this is my laboratory.

150
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,977
- Not any more.
- Pycelle: But...

151
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,773
(Scoffs)

152
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,942
(Door opens)

153
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,695
- You can save him?
- Difficult to say, your grace.

154
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,114
But if my past work is any guide...

155
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,574
(Door slams)

156
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,785
We stand a chance.

157
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,287
Do everything you can.

158
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,039
Come to me for anything you need.

159
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,707
Thank you, your grace.

160
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,542
You should know,

161
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,796
the process may change him

162
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,298
somewhat.

163
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,761
Will it weaken him?

164
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,597
Oh, no.

165
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,766
Very well, then.

166
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,036
Tywin: Not another word.

167
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,872
We've been over this. The matter's closed.

168
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,499
I'm opening it again.

169
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,253
You were betrothed to loras Tyrell.

170
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,297
You're still betrothed to loras Tyrell.

171
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:28,010
And you will marry loras Tyrell
as soon as tommen marries margaery.

172
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,220
I will not.

173
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,265
Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands.

174
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,226
Tyrion's sentence
will be carried out tomorrow.

175
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,940
You have on several occasions
made great claims

176
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,776
about your commitment
to this family's future.

177
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,405
Your role in that future
is more vital now than it ever was.

178
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,365
I don't care.

179
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,827
I will stay in king's landing where
I belong with my son, the king.

180
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,581
When you were nine years old,
I was called to the capital.

181
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,916
I decided to take your brother with me
and not you.

182
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:04,213
You insisted that you would not be left
at casterly rock under any circumstances.

183
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,024
- If you recall...
- I'm not interested in hearing

184
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,635
another one of your smug stories
about the time you won.

185
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,971
This isn't going to be one of those times.

186
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,639
Do you think you'll be the first person

187
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,767
dragged into a sept
to be married against her will?

188
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,704
When you marched into the throne room
to tell me

189
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,856
we'd won the battle of Blackwater,
do you remember?

190
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,110
I was sitting on the iron
throne with tommen.

191
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,213
I was about to give him
essence of nightshade.

192
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,697
That's how far I was willing to go

193
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,700
when I thought someone awful
had come to take my son away.

194
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,246
Someone awful is coming to take him away.

195
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,792
Joffrey is dead.
Myrcella's been sold like livestock.

196
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:45,004
And now you want to ship me off
to highgarden and steal my boy.

197
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,923
My last boy.

198
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,593
Margaery will dig her claws in,
you will dig your claws in,

199
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,222
and you'll fight over him like beasts
until you rip him apart.

200
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:58,351
I will burn our house to the ground
before I let that happen.

201
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,353
And how will you do that?

202
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,856
I'll tell everyone the truth.

203
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,275
What truth would that be?

204
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,156
You don't know, do you?

205
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,036
You never believed it.

206
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,788
How is that possible?

207
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,377
What am I saying? Of course it's possible.

208
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,838
How can someone so consumed
by the idea of his family

209
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:31,133
have any conception
what his actual family was doing?

210
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,221
We were right there in front of you,
and you didn't see us.

211
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,557
One real look in the past 20 years

212
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,309
at your own children
and you would have known.

213
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,895
Known what?

214
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,356
Everything they say is true

215
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,983
- about Jaime and me.
- No.

216
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,818
- Your legacy is a lie.
- No, no, no, no.

217
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,904
I don't believe you.

218
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,535
Yes, you do.

219
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,429
Cersei: Jaime.

220
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,016
You won.

221
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,768
One fewer brother.
Must be proud of yourself.

222
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,104
There's really nothing
you wouldn't do, is there?

223
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,023
For my family, no, nothing.

224
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,186
I would do things for my family
you couldn't imagine.

225
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,819
- Tyrion is your family.
- He's not.

226
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,822
- You don't get to choose.
- I do. So do you.

227
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,968
You can choose the creature that killed
our mother to come into this world...

228
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,453
Are you really mad enough
to blame him for that?

229
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,164
He didn't decide to kill
her. He was an infant.

230
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,082
A disease doesn't decide to kill you.

231
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,835
All the same, you cut
it out before it does.

232
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,795
What do you decide?

233
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,524
- What do you choose?
- The things I did to get back to you,

234
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,051
to endure all that, only to find you...

235
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,139
I choose you.

236
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,099
- Those are words.
- Yes.

237
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,143
Like the ones I just said to father.

238
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,188
I told him.

239
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:08,981
Told him what?

240
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,816
I told him about us.

241
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,988
- You told him?
- I told him I won't marry loras Tyrell.

242
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,617
I told him I'm staying right here
with tommen, with you.

243
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,495
- You think he'll just accept that?
- Go and ask him.

244
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:26,957
What did you say?

245
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,293
I don't want to talk about tywin Lannister.

246
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,962
I don't choose tywin Lannister.

247
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:36,217
I don't love tywin Lannister.
I love my brother.

248
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,677
I love my lover.

249
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:42,723
People will whisper, they'll
make theirjokes. Let them.

250
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,768
They're all so small, I
can't even see them.

251
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,020
I only see what matters.

252
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,699
- Someone will walk in.
- I don't care.

253
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,666
(Missandei speaking)

254
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,252
You stand before Daenerys stormborn,

255
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,545
the unburnt,

256
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:13,963
queen of meereen,

257
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,967
queen of the andals and the rhoynar
and the first men.

258
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,303
Khaleesi of the great grass sea,

259
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,640
breaker of chains and mother of dragons.

260
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,766
(Man speaking)

261
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:31,647
Thank you for seeing me, your grace.

262
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,692
My name is fennesz.

263
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,238
I can speak the common tongue, if you wish.

264
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,073
You speak it very well.

265
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,952
Before you freed me,
I belonged to master mighdal.

266
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:49,206
I was tutor to his children.
I taught them languages and history.

267
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,252
They know a great deal about your family
because of me.

268
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:58,758
Little calla is only seven,
but she admires you very much.

269
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,719
I hope I can prove
worthy of her admiration.

270
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,721
What can I do for you?

271
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:09,685
When you took the city, the children
begged me not to leave the house.

272
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,898
But master mighdal
and I agreed that I must.

273
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,776
So I lost my home.

274
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,780
Now I live on the streets.

275
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,573
I have outfitted mess halls

276
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,034
to feed all former slaves
and barracks to shelter them.

277
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,411
I do not mean to offend, your grace.

278
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,331
I went to one of these places.

279
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,292
The young prey on the old,

280
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,961
take what they want
and beat us if we resist.

281
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:39,340
My unsullied will make them safe again
in short order, my friend,

282
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,633
this I promise you.

283
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:44,512
Even if they are safe,
who would I be there?

284
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,348
What purpose would I serve?

285
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,810
With my master, I was a teacher.

286
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,522
I had the respect and love of his children.

287
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,649
What is it that you want from me?

288
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,400
Your grace,

289
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:02,655
I ask you to let me sell myself
back to master mighdal.

290
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,324
You want to return to a man who owned you

291
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,743
like a goat or a chair?

292
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,370
Please, your grace.

293
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,665
The young may rejoice in the new world
you have built for them,

294
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,709
but for those of us too old to change,

295
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:19,839
there is only fear and squalor.

296
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,132
I am not alone.

297
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:26,053
There are many outside
waiting to beg the same of you.

298
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:30,850
I did not take this city to preside over
the injustice I fought to destroy.

299
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,602
I took it to bring people freedom.

300
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,314
But freedom means making your own choices.

301
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,819
I will allow you to sign a contract
with your former master.

302
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:45,281
It may not cover a period
lasting longer than a year.

303
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,408
Thank you, your grace.

304
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,120
Thank you.

305
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,961
The masters will take advantage
of this situation.

306
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:05,134
The men serving them
will be slaves in all but name.

307
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,267
Approach, my friend.

308
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,182
I do not understand, my queen.

309
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,487
I do not understand, my queen.

310
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,740
The queen says you may approach.

311
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,081
(Sobbing)

312
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,125
(Speaking valyrian)

313
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,085
Missandei: (Translating)
I have brought you...

314
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,631
(Speaking valyrian)

315
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,175
He came from the sky.

316
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,177
(Speaking valyrian)

317
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,429
Missandei: The black one.

318
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,681
(Speaking valyrian)

319
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,809
The winged shadow.

320
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,186
(Speaking valyrian)

321
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,081
Missandei: He came from the sky and...

322
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,027
(Man speaking valyrian)

323
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,612
Missandei: My girl.

324
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,906
My little girl.

325
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,158
(Sobbing)

326
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,371
Daenerys: What was her name?

327
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,289
Missandei: Zala, your grace.

328
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:20,501
- How old was she?
- Three.

329
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,587
Three.

330
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,716
And still no word of drogon?

331
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,551
(Grey worm speaking)

332
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:34,139
Sailors saw him flying over the
black cliffs three days ago, my queen.

333
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,558
Nothing since then.

334
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,022
Meet me at the catacombs.

335
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,740
(Screeching)

336
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,034
(Screeches)

337
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,618
(Screeching)

338
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,722
(Screeching)

339
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,437
(Screeching)

340
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,452
(Screeching)

341
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,126
(Screeching)

342
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:15,509
Aemon: They came to us
from white harbour and barrowton,

343
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:19,638
from fairmarket and king's landing,

344
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,640
from north and south,

345
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,851
from east and west.

346
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,854
They died

347
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:31,733
protecting men, women, and children
who will never know their names.

348
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:34,486
It is for us to remember them.

349
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,280
Our brothers,

350
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,366
we shall never see their like again.

351
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,494
All: And now their watch is ended.

352
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:47,040
Aemon: And now their watch is ended.

353
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,101
(Fire crackling)

354
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:01,365
Your old blind man patched me up.

355
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,245
He's sworn to treat all wounded men,
friend or foe.

356
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,497
You want me alive so you can torture me?

357
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,873
No one's gonna torture you.

358
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:13,794
So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading?

359
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,754
Drop us from the top of the wall?

360
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,839
I don't know what happens to the prisoners.

361
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,758
Who decides?

362
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,386
I suppose Stannis does.

363
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,680
He your king now?

364
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,974
I don't have a king.

365
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:31,979
You spent too much time with us, Jon snow.

366
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,690
You can never be a kneeler again.

367
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:38,026
We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead.

368
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:43,907
- Do you want to say any words over them?
- Words? What kind of words?

369
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:47,119
Funeral words.
I don't know how the free folk do it.

370
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,370
Tormund: Do what?

371
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,580
Say farewell.

372
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:54,543
The dead can't hear us, boy.

373
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,590
Snow.

374
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,763
Did you love her?

375
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,852
She loved you.

376
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:15,397
- She told you?
- Tormund: No.

377
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,567
All she ever talked about was killing you.

378
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,736
That's how I know.

379
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,782
She belongs in the north.

380
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,660
The real north.

381
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,080
You understand me?

382
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,039
(Wind howling)

383
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,137
(Groaning)

384
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,438
We can stop. We can rest.

385
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,690
We'll rest with the three-eyed raven.

386
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:30,824
(Groans)

387
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,494
We're not going to make it.

388
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,375
We're already here.

389
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,668
Bran: Jojen.

390
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,880
Jojen.

391
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,507
Look, jojen.

392
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,219
(Both grunting)

393
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,424
Meera: Jojen! Come on!

394
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,760
Help them! Now!

395
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,262
Meera: Hold on to me!

396
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,555
(Grunting)

397
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,976
Hang on!

398
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,647
- Hodor. Hodor.
- Help them!

399
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,232
Hodor

400
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,861
- (growling)
- Hodor!

401
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:36,741
(Snarls)

402
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,789
(Grunts)

403
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,713
Hodod

404
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,189
(Growling)

405
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,442
Hodor: Hodor.

406
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,736
(Whimpering)

407
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,446
Hodod

408
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:46,853
Jojen: Bran!

409
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,817
Save yourself, now!

410
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,079
(Grunting)

411
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,290
(Shouts)

412
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,261
Girl: Come with me, Brandon stark.

413
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,684
(Gasping)

414
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:28,687
He is lost.

415
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,981
Come with me or die with him.

416
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,442
Go with them.

417
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,623
(Ice breaking)

418
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,586
(Slices)

419
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,380
(Growling)

420
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,631
(Sobs)

421
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,758
Girl: They cannot follow us.

422
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:42,051
The power that moves
them is powerless here.

423
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,054
Who are you?

424
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:49,726
The first men called us the children,
but we were born long before them.

425
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,520
Come, he waits for you.

426
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,275
(Rustling)

427
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,382
(Crow caws)

428
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,385
(Caws)

429
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,399
You're the three-eyed raven?

430
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,697
I've been many things.

431
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:29,284
Now I am what you see.

432
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,581
My brother, he led us to you and now he...

433
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,958
He knew what would happen.

434
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,502
From the moment he left,

435
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,714
he knew and he went anyway.

436
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,007
How do you know?

437
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,967
I've been watching you.

438
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:47,969
All of you.

439
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,179
All of your lives.

440
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,974
With 1,000 eyes and one.

441
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,687
Now you've come to me at last,

442
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,814
Brandon stark.

443
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,942
Though the hour is late.

444
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,904
I didn't want anyone to die for me.

445
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,324
He died so you could
find what you have lost.

446
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,494
You're going to help me walk again?

447
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,081
You will never walk again.

448
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,336
But you will fly.

449
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,020
Podrick.

450
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,856
Podrick.

451
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,358
Where are the horses?

452
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,778
I hobbled them last night.

453
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,363
What sort of hobble?

454
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,031
A figure eight, like you taught me.

455
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,677
If you did it like I taught you,
then the horses would be here.

456
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,702
Thieves, maybe?

457
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:58,373
It's at least 30 miles
to the eyrie from here.

458
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,249
You're carrying the saddlebags.

459
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,929
(Arya grunting)

460
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:29,654
People coming.

461
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,784
You can shit later. There's people coming.

462
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,162
Morning.

463
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,833
Morning.

464
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,419
I like your sword.

465
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,548
Are we getting close to the bloody gate?

466
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,550
About 10 more miles.

467
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,719
Did you hear that, podrick?

468
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,762
Only 10 more miles to the bloody gate.

469
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,266
Are you a knight?

470
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,478
But you know how to use that sword?

471
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,605
I do.

472
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,316
Does it have a name?

473
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,652
Oath keeper.

474
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,112
Mine's needle.

475
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,364
Good name.

476
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:17,368
Who taught you how to fight?

477
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,079
My father.

478
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,083
Mine never wanted to.

479
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,378
Said fighting was for boys.

480
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,464
Mine said the same.

481
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,632
But I kept fighting the boys anyway.

482
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,926
Kept losing.

483
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,428
Finally my father said,

484
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,097
"if you're going to do it,
you might as well do it right."

485
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,062
Seven blessings.

486
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,481
I'm brienne of tarth.
This is podrick Payne.

487
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,735
You want something?

488
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:54,238
That's sandor clegane. The hound.

489
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,168
You're Arya stark.

490
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,213
I asked if you wanted something.

491
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,882
I swore to your mother
I would bring you home to her.

492
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:17,053
- My mother's dead.
- Brienne: I know.

493
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,139
I wish I could have
been there to protect her.

494
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,017
You're not a northerner.

495
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:26,354
No, but I swore a
sacred vow to protect her.

496
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,731
Why didn't you?

497
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,613
She commanded me to bring
Jaime Lannister back to king's landing.

498
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,448
You're paid by the lannisters.

499
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,034
You're here for the bounty on me.

500
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,787
I'm not paid by the lannisters.

501
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,502
Fancy sword you've got there.
Where'd you get it?

502
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:54,882
I've been looking at
Lannister gold all my life.

503
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:59,595
Go on, brienne of fucking tarth.

504
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,722
Tell me that's not Lannister gold.

505
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,893
Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.

506
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:07,770
The bloody gate is 10 miles.

507
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:09,665
I swore to your mother
by the old gods and the new.

508
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:11,065
I don't care what you swore.

509
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,650
- Arya!
- Hound: You heard the girl.

510
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:15,486
- She's not coming with you.
- She is.

511
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,073
You're not a good listener.

512
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,908
Valyrian steel?

513
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,828
I always wanted some valyrian steel.

514
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,664
Come with me, Arya.
I'll take you to safety.

515
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,458
Safety? Where the fuck's that?

516
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,742
Her aunt in the eyrie is dead.

517
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,713
Her mother's dead. Her father's dead.
Her brother's dead.

518
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,090
Winterfell is a pile of rubble.

519
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38,301
There is no safety, you dumb bitch.

520
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,931
You don't know that by now,
you're the wrong one to watch over her.

521
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:46,350
And that's what you're doing?

522
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:47,810
Watching over her?

523
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,938
Aye, that's what I'm doing.

524
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:06,454
(Grunts)

525
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,753
(Brienne panting)

526
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,465
(Both grunting)

527
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,316
(Groans)

528
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,050
I have no wish to kill you, ser.

529
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,606
I'm not a knight.

530
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,775
(Groans)

531
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:21,028
(Groans)

532
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,035
(Screams)

533
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:37,670
(Screaming)

534
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:40,715
(Hound screams)

535
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,701
(Screaming)

536
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,487
- Where is she?
- Podrick: She was just here.

537
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,714
Why weren't you watching her?

538
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:47,716
I was watching you.
I thought you might need some help.

539
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,867
Which way, pod? Which way did she go?

540
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,869
Podrick: I think that way.

541
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,871
Brienne: Arya!

542
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,314
(Hound panting)

543
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,654
You still here?

544
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,740
(Coughs)

545
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,457
Big bitch saved you.

546
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:40,960
I don't need saving.

547
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,421
No, not you. You're a real killer.

548
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:45,923
With your water dancing

549
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,883
and your needle.

550
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,970
You gonna die?

551
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,556
Unless there's a maester
hiding behind that rock,

552
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,016
aye,

553
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,561
I'm done.

554
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,899
I'd skin you alive for wine.

555
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,987
Fuck water.

556
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:11,991
Killed by a woman. (Chuckles)

557
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:14,827
I bet you like that.

558
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,373
Go on,

559
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,459
go after her.

560
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,003
She'll help you.

561
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,258
Going it alone,

562
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:32,219
you won't last a day out there.

563
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,389
I'll last longer than you.

564
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:44,398
You remember where the heart is?

565
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:54,700
Fuck it. I'm ready.

566
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:58,746
Go on, girl.

567
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:02,124
Another name off your list.

568
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:05,085
You kept promising me.

569
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:16,055
I cut down your butcher's boy. The ginger.

570
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,850
He was begging for mercy.

571
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,937
"Please, ser. Please don't kill me.

572
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,980
"Please, please."

573
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:29,485
Bled all over my horse.

574
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,946
Saddle stunk of butcher's boy for weeks.

575
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,951
And your sister.

576
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,745
Your pretty sister.

577
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,666
I should have taken her.

578
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:47,086
That night the Blackwater burned.

579
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,130
I should have fucked her bloody.

580
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,385
At least I'd have one happy memory.

581
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,814
Do I have to beg you?

582
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,070
Do it.

583
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,910
Do it.

584
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,707
Do it.

585
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:56,864
Kill me.

586
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,118
Kill me!

587
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,415
Kill me!

588
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:08,876
Kill me!

589
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,629
(Door opens)

590
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,466
(Door closes)

591
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,551
(Footsteps approaching)

592
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,889
Oh, get on with it, you son of a whore.

593
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,069
Is that any way to speak about our mother?

594
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,728
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

595
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,748
A galley's waiting in the bay
bound for the free cities.

596
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,231
- Who's helping you?
- Varys.

597
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,567
- Varys?
- You have more friends than you thought.

598
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,125
There's a locked door
at the top of the stairs.

599
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,249
Knock on it twice, then twice again.

600
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,044
Varys will open.

601
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,047
I suppose this is goodbye, then.

602
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:12,773
Farewell, little brother.

603
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,651
Jaime.

604
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:20,280
Thank you. For my life.

605
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,202
Quickly now.

606
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,908
Woman: Tywin?

607
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,120
My lion.

608
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:04,718
(Shae grunting)

609
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,034
(Grunts)

610
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,161
(Gasping)

611
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,294
(Whimpers)

612
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,326
I'm sorry.

613
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,341
I'm sorry.

614
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,232
(Crossbow lever dragging)

615
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,051
(Door creaks)

616
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,265
Tyrion.

617
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,851
Put down the crossbow.

618
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,690
Who released you?

619
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:28,528
Your brother, I expect.
He always had a soft spot for you.

620
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,366
Come, we'll go and talk in my chambers.

621
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:39,998
This is how you want to speak to me, hmm?

622
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:42,376
Shaming your father has
always given you pleasure...

623
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,294
All my life

624
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,546
you've wanted me dead.

625
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,509
Yes.

626
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:53,178
But you refused to die.

627
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,721
I respect that.

628
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:56,640
Even admire it.

629
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:59,017
You fight for what's yours.

630
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:02,729
I'd never let them execute you.
Is that what you fear?

631
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,649
I'll never let ilyn Payne take your head.

632
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,776
You're a Lannister.

633
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,072
You're my son.

634
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,826
I loved her.

635
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:17,869
Who?

636
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,288
Shae.

637
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,416
Oh, Tyrion.

638
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:24,750
Put down that crossbow.

639
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:26,044
I murdered her.

640
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,215
With my own hands.

641
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,594
It doesn't matter.

642
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,763
Doesn't matter?

643
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:38,181
She was a whore.

644
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,853
- Say that word again...
- And what?

645
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,355
You'll kill your own father in the privy?

646
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,068
You're my son.

647
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,529
Now, enough of this nonsense.

648
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,907
I am your son, and you sentenced me to die.

649
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:59,786
You knew I didn't poison Joffrey,

650
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,622
but you sentenced me all the same.

651
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:05,167
- _why?
- Enough.

652
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,253
We'll go back to my chambers
and speak with some dignity.

653
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:11,006
I can't go back there. She's in there.

654
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,289
You're afraid of a dead whore?

655
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:16,219
(Groans)

656
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:26,855
You shot me.

657
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,154
(Groans)

658
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,200
You're no son of mine.

659
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,534
I am your son.

660
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:43,663
I have always been your son.

661
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:45,832
(Groans)

662
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,472
What have you done?

663
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:03,642
Quickly.

664
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,065
Trust me, my friend.
I've brought you this far.

665
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,389
(Bells tolling)

666
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,681
I want to see the captain.

667
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,475
You're seeing him.

668
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,685
I want to go north, to the wall.

669
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:13,146
No, you don't.

670
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:15,398
I can pay.

671
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:18,568
There is nothing in the north
but ice and war and pirates.

672
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,821
I wouldn't need a cabin. Please.

673
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:23,573
I could work scrubbing the floors...

674
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:26,409
I'm not going north, child. I'm going home.

675
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:29,371
- Where's home?
- The free city of braavos.

676
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,249
Wait. I have something else.

677
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:35,919
- More silver won't make a difference.
- It's not silver.

678
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,170
It's iron.

679
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:41,424
This...

680
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,181
- How did you...
- Valar morghulis.

681
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,644
Valar dohaeris.

682
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,438
Of course, you shall have a cabin.
