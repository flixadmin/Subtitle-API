1
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:47,422
So cigarettes and gas is $79.70.

2
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,884
Crap.

3
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,094
There's an ATM right outside.

4
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,681
Yeah, I don't have a card.

5
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,769
Well, you can write a personal check
with ID.

6
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,689
Kind of in between banks right now.

7
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,610
You think I could just come back later?

8
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,821
I'm totally good for it.
I'd come back, I swear.

9
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,952
If it were me, I'd be totally,
you know, "No problem."

10
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,997
But my dad is this ginormous hard-ass.

11
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,583
He was in Fallujah for a year.

12
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,295
And he always checks the receipts.
I mean, like, always.

13
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,589
I gotta call him. I'm sorry.

14
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,132
Wait, wait, wait.

15
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,511
Hold on a second.

16
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,972
Maybe we could

17
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,642
trade.

18
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,149
Ever try it?

19
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,113
I mean, I smoke pot a lot sometimes.

20
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,156
I party.

21
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,658
But...

22
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,869
- But that stuff's really addictive, right?
- Not really.

23
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:03,498
It's just a media thing. You know?

24
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,462
What's it like?

25
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,052
It's awesome.

26
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:23,017
Everything's maximum interesting.

27
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:30,184
You get these really cold
and sharp-like action dagger feelings.

28
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,864
It's awesome.

29
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,493
Come on. What do you say?

30
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,236
Have a nice day.

31
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,611
So how does it feel?

32
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,404
Does it hurt?

33
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,949
Yeah, it's tight.

34
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,452
- Yeah, but is it painful?
- It's hard to breathe.

35
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,956
Well, you need your breathing.

36
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,917
{\an8}Although let's not lose sight of the fact

37
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,463
{\an8}that you were the victim
of a terrible accident, Antonio,

38
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,174
{\an8}so some discomfort is to be expected.

39
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,683
Let's go with that one.

40
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,147
{\an8}A cashier's check, <i>por favor.</i>

41
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:37,360
{\an8}Oh, and spread the word.
I'm building a class-action, flight 515.

42
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,177
{\an8}Victims' families would be great.

43
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,070
{\an8}I'll take anyone on the ground
who suffered emotionally.

44
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:45,368
{\an8}Anxiety, sleeplessness.
You get the picture.

45
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,953
{\an8}Trouble?

46
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,498
<i>Ted Beneke? You cannot be serious.</i>

47
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,002
<i>- That guy is a joke.
- You know what? You called my bluff.</i>

48
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,461
{\an8}<i>What does that even mean?</i>

49
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,828
{\an8}<i>You dared me to tell the police
and I couldn't do it, so you win.</i>

50
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,468
{\an8}<i>If you want to stay in this house, fine,
but we are not married anymore.</i>

51
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,972
{\an8}<i>I told you that
I was done cooking meth, Skyler.</i>

52
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,739
{\an8}<i>- I promised you that.
- So what?</i>

53
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,351
{\an8}<i>You know what?
At least I didn't run off to go...</i>

54
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,813
{\an8}<i>Jesus! I mean, everything that I did,
I did for this family.</i>

55
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,149
<i>- Just keep telling yourself that.
- What is that supposed to mean?</i>

56
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,985
<i>You don't like it, then leave.</i>

57
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,488
{\an8}<i>- And take your drug money with you.
- That's what you want.</i>

58
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,827
{\an8}- Jesus.
- Garbage disposal.

59
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,912
{\an8}<i>You think this will get me to move out?</i>

60
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,846
{\an8}<i>You can screw Ted. You can screw
the butcher, the mailman.</i>

61
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,458
{\an8}<i>- God, Walt.
- Whoever you want.</i>

62
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,253
<i>Screw them all.
I'm not going anywhere.</i>

63
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,213
{\an8}<i>Suit yourself.</i>

64
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,008
{\an8}Is this a good or bad thing?

65
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,720
{\an8}<i>Suit myself.
You want me to suit myself?</i>

66
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,722
{\an8}<i>I'll suit myself to his face!</i>

67
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,058
It's a bad thing.

68
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,403
{\an8}Hello.

69
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,406
{\an8}Walter White to see Ted Beneke.

70
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:09,577
I'm sorry.
Mr. Beneke's on a conference call.

71
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,581
{\an8}Okay. I will wait.

72
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,708
{\an8}It could be a while.

73
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,878
{\an8}I have all the time in the world.

74
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,530
Okay.

75
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,283
{\an8}- Here we go. Okay.
- Excuse me.

76
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,650
- Mr. Beneke's not available.
- Ted? Come on.

77
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,538
Sir, excuse me.

78
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,124
{\an8}Excuse me.

79
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,959
{\an8}Ted, I can see you.

80
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,628
I can see you standing right there
in your office.

81
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,838
Now, come on.

82
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,926
Open the door. Come on, let's talk.
I just want to talk. That's all.

83
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,793
Come on, let's be men about this.
Okay? How about that?

84
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,456
Hey, Walt. I'm kind of in the middle
of something now.

85
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,269
Oh, yes, you are.

86
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,146
So open the door.

87
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,648
You're damn right.
You're right in the middle.

88
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,317
Just open the door
and let's talk about it, okay?

89
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,653
Open the door, Ted, right now.

90
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,825
You don't want to be a man about it?
Plan B. How do you like that? Plan B.

91
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,828
We have a situation.

92
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:41,502
Walt. Walt. Walt.

93
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,963
What are you doing?

94
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,840
I'm talking with Ted.

95
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:01,564
Next time, you'll open the door.

96
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,401
- Freeze! Come on.
- Oh, damn it.

97
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,986
No, I'm just here to talk.

98
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,530
- I just want to talk to him.
- Outside. Let's go.

99
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:13,201
God. Can I just talk?
I just want to talk to him.

100
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,452
{\an8}- Calm down.
- I'm just... Okay, all right.

101
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,831
{\an8}All right, all right, all right.
I'm calm. I'm calm.

102
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,334
{\an8}Asshole.

103
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,188
{\an8}What do you want?
What do you want?

104
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,233
{\an8}Hey! Hey, come on.

105
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,168
What the hell is wrong with you?

106
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,778
You act like you're the first guy
this happened to.

107
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,576
{\an8}I caught my second wife screwing
my stepdad, okay?

108
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:59,038
{\an8}It's a cruel world, Walt. Grow up.

109
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,272
{\an8}- I just wanted to talk to him.
- Yeah, well, now I'm talking to you.

110
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,378
{\an8}Consider this an intervention.

111
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,297
{\an8}You could have been arrested
back there. You understand.

112
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,564
{\an8}Speaking as your lawyer,
I'm always looking for billable hours.

113
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,928
But speaking as your business associate

114
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,931
I'm strongly advising
that you get your shit together.

115
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:22,436
Just cool it with this Beneke guy,
at least for now. Okay?

116
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:27,441
Let's talk shop, because
I think this is a great opportunity

117
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:31,320
{\an8}to channel some of that negative
energy into something positive.

118
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,574
{\an8}- How did you know?
- Sorry?

119
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,285
{\an8}About Skyler.
About where to find me just now.

120
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,453
{\an8}How did you know?

121
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:43,499
That's just my meticulousness.
Don't bog down in detail, Walt.

122
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,794
- The lesson here should be...
- Did you bug my house?

123
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,532
Yeah, but I didn't know it was
your house, did I?

124
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,304
You'd moved out.
Besides, you basically told me to.

125
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,473
- I told you to?
- You strongly hinted that I should.

126
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,686
You were worried your wife might say
something to the police.

127
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:08,482
What? No, no, that's not true.
When the hell did I say that?

128
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,277
Let's not get lost in the who,
what and whens.

129
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,656
The point is we did our due diligence
and she didn't talk.

130
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,867
She kept quiet.
She stood by you, Walt

131
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,996
which, if you ask me,
is the ironical silver lining here.

132
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,998
I mean, on the one hand

133
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:29,003
sure, she snuck off the reservation
to get some dirty, damp and deep.

134
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,463
On the other hand...

135
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,892
Off me.

136
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,522
You're fired!

137
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,149
- You're done!
- Good!

138
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,266
"Oh, boohoo,
I won't cook meth anymore."

139
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,153
You're a crybaby. Who needs you?

140
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,070
I'm unplugging the website,
so no more money laundering.

141
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,248
How do you like that?

142
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,077
I want those bugs out of my house today.

143
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,537
I want them out now!

144
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:07,500
You just bought a $300 suit, psycho!

145
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,503
Go.

146
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,886
Great, drilled right into the stucco.

147
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,225
A little bit of putty, you'll be fine.

148
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,437
Just make sure
you get all of those things.

149
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:32,942
A, these things cost $800 apiece.

150
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,694
B, you're not that interesting.

151
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,905
So yeah, I'll get all of them, Walter.

152
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,577
Great line of work, by the way.
Real upstanding field.

153
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,621
Yeah, well

154
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,375
I enjoy it.

155
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,429
You're free to leave now. Anytime.

156
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,766
You know, Walter

157
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:10,271
sometimes it doesn't hurt
to have someone watching your back.

158
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,936
Mr. White?

159
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,068
Hi.

160
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,655
What's up?

161
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:49,579
I can't begin to understand
what you're going through, Walt

162
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:54,750
with all of your health concerns
and the stresses you've been under.

163
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,544
But still, as educators

164
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:00,756
there are certain responsibilities
we need to be meeting here

165
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,718
to the school
and to the students themselves.

166
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,470
Of course.

167
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,267
Is this a wheaten terrier?

168
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,895
Norfolk.

169
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,897
Norfolk?

170
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,566
That's surprising.

171
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:23,405
Walt, could you come back over here
and have a seat, please?

172
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,740
Sure.

173
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:40,088
You've been absent a lot recently.

174
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:45,385
And when you are here at school, there
have been some behavioral questions.

175
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,054
And frankly I'm concerned.

176
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,559
Thank you.

177
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,236
Are you feeling okay?

178
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,449
Do you think maybe I should call Skyler?

179
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,328
No.

180
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:21,004
Let's just keep this...

181
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,839
What...?

182
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,593
Hey!

183
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,096
Walt, what's wrong with you?

184
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:15,517
You know, look, you're the one
always talking about D.C., okay?

185
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,352
This is how you get there.

186
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,522
You answer the bell.
You pay your dues.

187
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:28,196
Besides, you know,
it's a big deal to get picked for this.

188
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:33,368
El Paso's like the Super Bowl.

189
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,705
I could get killed crossing the street,
okay?

190
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:41,126
Whatever. You know, I want to go.

191
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,545
What about last time?

192
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,755
What about last time?

193
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,447
Schrader.

194
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,533
Hey, sheriff. Yeah.

195
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,036
Blue, huh?

196
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,292
Yeah, yeah. Thing is...

197
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,087
Thing is I'm supposed to be getting
on a plane right now.

198
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:34,095
The stuff this guy had was blue.
You sure about that?

199
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,766
Yeah.

200
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,769
Yeah, I want to talk to him.

201
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,441
Taxi.

202
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,774
- Hi.
- Man, I'm sorry.

203
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:31,277
I needed to talk to you,
but you weren't at your apartment.

204
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,821
No, I moved back home.

205
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:35,990
That's good, right?

206
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,159
Yeah.

207
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,496
- Yo, did you just get fired?
- No.

208
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,165
No, no, no.

209
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,775
It's more like a sabbatical.

210
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,837
Indefinite. Yeah.

211
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,021
So, what's up?

212
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,691
Should we go somewhere?

213
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,069
No, this is fine.

214
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:18,992
So I want an intro to your guy.

215
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,577
What guy?

216
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,236
Your guy. Your distribution guy.
The guy Saul hooked you up with.

217
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,500
No, no, no. Come on, Jesse.

218
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:32,213
- I thought about it and I want to.
- God.

219
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,173
It's the one thing I'm good at.

220
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,051
No, that is just not true.

221
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,762
You're good at a lot of things, son.

222
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,347
Like what?

223
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,436
What about your sobriety?

224
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,689
I told you, I'm not using.

225
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,733
Ever.

226
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,612
I just want back into the business.

227
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:03,119
Well, I don't. I'm sorry.

228
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,455
I know, and that's cool.

229
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:09,250
I'm not asking you to cook.

230
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,254
What's this?

231
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:18,259
In the end, I just went with
two reflux condensers.

232
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,928
I didn't want to lose track
of my pH levels.

233
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:25,099
But I did everything else
just like you taught me.

234
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,770
Super careful in my amounts,

235
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,440
and watched the numbers
every step of the way.

236
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:36,861
So, what do you think?
It's good, right?

237
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:44,786
What in the hell is this?

238
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,163
- What?
- What?

239
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:50,833
This. This. This is my product.

240
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,503
This is my formula. This is mine.

241
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:58,007
It's our product,
but yeah, I was gonna cut you in.

242
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,884
Oh, you were gonna cut me in?

243
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,470
No, no, no. I cut you in.

244
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:06,474
What the hell is your problem?
All I'm asking is for you to set a meet.

245
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:09,602
- Absolutely not.
- Why?

246
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,671
Because I am not gonna lend my name
to an inferior product.

247
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,151
I mean, look at the diameters here.

248
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,112
What did you use for reduction?

249
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,156
Don't tell me. Platinum dioxide, right?

250
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,493
No. Mercury-aluminum amalgam.

251
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,829
The dioxide's too hard to keep wet.

252
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,355
All right, well,
you must've done it wrong, then.

253
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:35,294
Your color is all cloudy, so you were
struggling with distillation too.

254
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,172
Now, this is very shoddy work, Pinkman.

255
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,341
I'm actually embarrassed for you.

256
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,135
What?

257
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,848
No way. I gave out samples
and everyone said it was the bomb.

258
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,476
Oh, they said it was the bomb.

259
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,646
And who were they, I wonder?
A bunch of meth heads?

260
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:54,856
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

261
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,692
- They should know, right?
- Yeah, well, sorry.

262
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:00,194
- I can't help you.
- Fine, ass-wad.

263
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,364
- I'll contact the guy myself.
- Oh, yeah? Well, good luck.

264
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:06,868
Because my guy is a pro
and he doesn't deal with junkies.

265
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,746
- You know what? Eat me.
- Anytime, loser.

266
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,038
Hey, hey, hey!

267
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:14,250
Wait. Hey!

268
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:56,000
I can't believe it's only 4:00.

269
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,421
This day is dragging.

270
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,765
Okay.

271
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,961
I wish I could stay.

272
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,755
So stay.

273
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:47,677
What's stopping you?

274
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:53,266
What, like everything, you mean?

275
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:57,478
How about my lunatic husband
refusing to leave the house?

276
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,940
So move in here.

277
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:07,822
And then my son hating me even more.

278
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,784
That'll pass.
I went through that with the girls.

279
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,369
They adapt.

280
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:18,332
And now everyone at work thinks
I'm an evil ladder-climbing whore.

281
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:21,210
They're all fired, effective immediately.

282
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,004
What else?

283
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,467
Oh, aren't you the answer man?

284
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,681
Where did it...?

285
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:39,812
Where did it go wrong, exactly,
with you and Walt?

286
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:47,487
I mean, I always saw him as kind of...

287
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,033
mild-mannered.

288
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,913
Something, I don't know,
change when he got sick or...?

289
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:00,666
I don't know what changed, Ted.

290
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:05,003
And I just don't feel really comfortable
talking about it.

291
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,131
Sorry.

292
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,551
Just asking out of self-interest.

293
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:13,387
Gotta make sure
I don't make the same mistake.

294
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,683
I would be amazed.

295
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,061
Just let me see if
I'm following you here, Russell.

296
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:27,944
You got this stuff from some guy
at Gasparza's

297
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,946
who was wearing tan pants,

298
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:34,283
and who you're 80 percent sure
had a mustache.

299
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,910
That's it, right?

300
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:39,914
That's your brain
working at maximum capacity?

301
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,422
Russell.

302
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,759
Everything all right in there?

303
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:56,681
Mel. The dude's name was Mel.

304
00:25:57,098 --> 00:26:01,310
Well, there you go. See?
You served an actual earthly function.

305
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,396
I can't believe I remembered that.

306
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:07,608
Mel who?
Does he have a last name?

307
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:09,986
Yeah, Mel.

308
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,071
Wait.

309
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:15,700
Was it Mel,

310
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,286
or Mark?

311
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,497
It was definitely an M name.

312
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:23,791
Oh, man, I'm losing it.

313
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,460
Wait, wait.

314
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,131
Yeah.

315
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,134
It's gone.

316
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:34,635
It's gone.

317
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,095
- It was an M name though.
- Yeah.

318
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,141
I remember the... sound.

319
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:46,147
All right, well,
we'll go with the... sound.

320
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:48,065
- Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

321
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:50,234
He definitely had tan pants.

322
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,364
Remind me to get a vasectomy.

323
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,331
Okay, it's after 9,
so this bar that Girl George is at

324
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,451
probably wall-to-wall dirtbags by now.

325
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:06,000
Let's go have a little looky-loo,
see if we can't find this M-named clown.

326
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:12,006
What? It's a lead.

327
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:15,009
- Lead to what?
- To Heisenberg.

328
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:18,720
I told you it was only a matter of time
before this guy booted up again.

329
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,723
Here we go, my friend.

330
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,990
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful,
Gomey.

331
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,062
Just apologize and buy me a beer.

332
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:29,147
Man, you're reaching.

333
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:33,402
This stuff could be a knockoff
or left over from an older cook.

334
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,197
How do you know Heisenberg's
gearing up again?

335
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:38,991
How do I know?

336
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,869
Because I know.

337
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,412
I don't get it.

338
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,916
This is the reason why
you're blowing off the task force?

339
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,001
Chase down teeners?

340
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,838
I'm getting tired
of all the second-guessing.

341
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,717
If you're not sufficiently stimulated
by this investigation

342
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,177
do us both a favor
and ask for a transfer.

343
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,722
What is up with you lately?

344
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:05,601
Starting bar fights,
turning down El Paso,

345
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,185
and now this bullshit?

346
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,314
Do you need to talk to someone or what?

347
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,733
Talk to someone?

348
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:15,193
Talk to who?

349
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:22,576
I'm not trying to step on your toes,
bro. Okay?

350
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,413
I'm just worried about you.
That's all.

351
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,916
Appreciate that, bro.

352
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,336
Now take your hand off my shoulder.

353
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,809
Yeah, yeah, the one that was on TV.

354
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,939
Did any little piece
fall on your property?

355
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:55,109
I'm not looking for an entire wing here,
Mr. Linkas.

356
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:58,320
It could be a nut or a bolt.
It could be a bag of peanuts

357
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,657
just so long as it caused you
pain and suffering.

358
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:04,410
Oh, no, no, no. Closed.
Calling you back.

359
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:07,913
You had your chance.
I told you to get him cooking again.

360
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:11,917
You blew it off and now it's too late.
The guy's gone mass maniac on us!

361
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,434
All I wanted was to show you two
your potential.

362
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,839
And what do I get in return?
A bone contusion.

363
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:20,384
You wanna see the scar?
I wish you two had...

364
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,261
Hi, there.

365
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:27,016
- How in the hell did you get Walt to...?
- I made it.

366
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:30,478
You know the guy
who knows the guy, right?

367
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:05,346
Well, good news is,

368
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:09,850
for a stage-three cancer,
the guy's doing well physically.

369
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,144
Mentally, the guy's a disaster.

370
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,856
He's gone off the rails
over this thing with his wife.

371
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:20,986
My opinion, he's not coming back.
Not on his own.

372
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,701
Your friends were at his place again,
by the way.

373
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:31,038
They drew something on the street
outside his house.

374
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:35,251
- The scythe.
- Animals.

375
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,169
- Does the lawyer know?
- Should he?

376
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:38,879
No.

377
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:45,052
If you want this guy to produce again,
why not just tell him?

378
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,596
You stand between him
and an ax in the head.

379
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,349
I don't believe fear
to be an effective motivator.

380
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,393
I want investment.

381
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:56,230
For now, I'm simply interested
in time frame.

382
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:59,358
He will live for the foreseeable future,
yes?

383
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:05,114
Foreseeable. Couple years at least,
barring acts of God and men with axes.

384
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,965
From the lawyer,
I'm supposed to let you know

385
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,787
the Pinkman kid is looking to sell.

386
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:15,583
- I don't work with junkies.
- That's what I thought you'd say.

387
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,585
Probably for the best.

388
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,087
What I hear,
he and Walter are splitsville.

389
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,257
Really?

390
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:26,886
That's what Goodman says.
Cats and dogs.

391
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,098
Do the deal.

392
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:01,480
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

393
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:05,401
<i>Agent Schrader, you need
to be calling me back ASAP.</i>

394
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:09,238
<i>I've got Texas breathing down
my neck and I'm not about...</i>

395
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:34,555
<i>No, I haven't seen Matt since my dad
fired him, like, a while ago.</i>

396
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:36,598
Where can I find him, you think?

397
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,851
- No idea. Haven't seen him.
- I know. You said that a few times.

398
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:44,565
Yeah, because I haven't seen him.
I don't know what else to say.

399
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:51,905
- What's your name, darling?
- Cara.

400
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,372
Where did this come from, Cara?

401
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,417
I don't know.

402
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,587
What is it? Drugs?

403
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:12,217
Look, I'm just gonna come right out
and say it.

404
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:15,262
You're a bad liar, Cara.

405
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:19,808
Don't get me wrong.
Not the worst I've ever seen.

406
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:24,938
Once had a guy try to explain the dope
balloon up his butt on bad Thai food.

407
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:30,194
Still, you're not a very good liar.

408
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:33,947
- I honestly don't know...
- Stop.

409
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:37,284
You look like a good kid.
I'm not here to get you in trouble.

410
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:41,330
But you need to tell me
where this came from right now!

411
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:49,463
I never do stuff like this.
I swear to God.

412
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,966
I tried it and I hated it,
so I just gave it to Matt.

413
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,218
- Okay, and who gave it to you?
- Some guy.

414
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:59,431
He came in a couple days ago
and wanted to trade it for gas.

415
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,643
Some guy? What's his name?

416
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:07,106
Okay, what...? What did he look like?

417
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,859
I don't know.

418
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,028
He looked pretty normal.

419
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:15,656
You know, white.

420
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:22,663
I think his hair was lightish brown.

421
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,833
He had really blue eyes.

422
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,335
They were really, really blue.

423
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:31,296
Yeah, yeah, yeah, dreamy.
Okay, what else?

424
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:36,385
Piercings, jewelry, distinctive
articles of clothing. Come on.

425
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:39,012
Come on.

426
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,015
Listen to me.

427
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:46,019
It's real important that I find the person
that had these drugs.

428
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:49,523
So if you can remember anything else...

429
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:55,779
Come on, think.
Come on, now. Come on.

430
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,283
He drove an RV.

431
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:01,493
Okay, good, good.

432
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,935
What can you remember?
What kind of RV?

433
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,915
What color?
Did you spot a license plate?

434
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:12,713
I don't know the kinds
and I didn't see the license.

435
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:18,886
But the color was,
I think, white, brownish color.

436
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:22,681
I'm sorry.

437
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,058
I know I'm not helping you...

438
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:29,688
but, please, don't tell my dad.

439
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:40,616
Cara.

440
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:47,331
Please, tell me that that camera works.

441
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,387
Damn it.

442
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:00,988
Bingo.

443
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,343
These eggs are good, Mom.

444
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,345
Thanks.

445
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,684
Hey, you know what's weird?
Dad's website.

446
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:33,687
It's been three days
since the last donation.

447
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:41,320
Yeah, well, people lose interest.

448
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,170
So how long are you off for?

449
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,092
A few weeks.

450
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:07,095
I'll play it by ear.

451
00:39:09,723 --> 00:39:15,896
I probably pushed it, you know,
going back to work too soon.

452
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:29,409
Think I can get a ride today?
Louis has a doctor's appointment.

453
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,914
Yeah.

454
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:43,090
Hey, so, Dad can babysit now, right?

455
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:48,095
You won't have to take Holly
to work every day.

456
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:59,398
Sometime, maybe.

457
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:03,235
Yeah, we'll see.

458
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,320
What's up?

459
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:54,953
I think you'll seriously enjoy, yo.

460
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:15,348
Wait. No, no. No way.

461
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:20,854
Hey! Hey!

462
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:26,067
Hey. What the hell? This is only half.

463
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,029
That's right. It's your half.

464
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:35,827
Yo, where's the other half, bitch?

465
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:41,166
I mean, the whole thing was crazy.
Poor bastard. I felt sorry for him.

466
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:45,253
I think he actually thought
we were the cable guys, you know.

467
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:51,009
Anyway, sorry about
those missed calls, chief.

468
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,426
I'm changing providers.
It won't happen again.

469
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,390
Are you going to El Paso, Hank?

470
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:00,894
Hell, yes.
With pointy boots and bells on.

471
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:02,961
Got this break in the Heisenberg case.

472
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:06,024
The blue meth, you mean?
The teenth?

473
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,735
Yeah, well,
that teenth got things rolling.

474
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:12,239
I traced it to a gas station in Cibola.
That's where I got these.

475
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:16,076
The station's closed-circuit was down...
Surprise, surprise.

476
00:42:16,243 --> 00:42:21,206
...but I was able to pull some of these
snapshots off an ATM security camera.

477
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:23,958
We always thought these guys
might be camper-cooking.

478
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,545
First off, your typical Class C
motor home

479
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:29,661
is gonna grunt at least 5000 pounds
of interior fixtures.

480
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:33,426
Appliances, furniture, built-ins,
5000 pounds at least, okay?

481
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:36,221
See how high that suspension's riding?

482
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:39,933
{\an8}No way, no how, this thing's carrying
that kind of weight.

483
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,937
This thing has been cleared out and
stripped down to its tight-and-curlies.

484
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:47,482
For what? Blood bank?

485
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,776
Maybe a bookmobile?

486
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:53,780
There's no clear view of the plates.

487
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:56,283
Yeah, well, you can only get
so lucky, right?

488
00:42:56,449 --> 00:43:00,120
But there's no front plate. Tells me
it's likely New Mexico registration.

489
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:01,413
I check with DMV.

490
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,959
There are only 29 of these early-'80s
Bounders registered in the state.

491
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:11,256
- Only 29?
- Yeah.

492
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:14,718
So I gotta go, you know,
knock on some doors.

493
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,227
They need you in El Paso, Hank.

494
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:28,148
You bet. I'm just gonna wrap up
this Heisenberg thing first.

495
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:30,858
- You're refusing the assignment.
- I'm not. I'll go.

496
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,819
It's just I need some more time.

497
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:35,822
You're not hearing me, Agent Schrader.

498
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:37,866
You're out of time.

499
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:43,496
Are you going to El Paso now, tonight?

500
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:49,878
It's a simple yes or no.

501
00:43:56,509 --> 00:44:01,181
No. I can't.

502
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:09,356
But that's only because
I'm really close to something big here.

503
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:21,701
Better get to it, then.

504
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:50,063
<i>This is KECA 480,
Albuquerque's news radio.</i>

505
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,399
<i>KECA news time, 10:13.</i>

506
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:55,026
<i>Our top story this hour, Donald Margolis</i>

507
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:59,280
