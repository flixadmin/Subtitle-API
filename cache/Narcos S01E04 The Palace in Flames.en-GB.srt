00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:26,545
WANTED: PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
$100,000 REWARD

2
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:43,242
Now more than ever
is the time for solidarity.

3
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,913
You make the mistakes,
and then you preach solidarity?

4
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,332
—Shut up, fag.
—What the fuck, Carlos?

5
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:53,502
Why are you always defending him?

6
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,546
Did he get your sister
back for you or not?

7
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:59,424
We rescued her
because we did it together. Right?

8
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,389
Gentlemen …

9
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,519
I suggest we form another organization

10
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:14,023
to fight against
this injustice of extradition.

11
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,316
Like John Lennon said,

12
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,862
—“Come together, hermanos y hermanas--”
—Stop that fag shit now.

13
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,074
So Jorge …

14
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,201
what will we call it?

15
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,929
Next!

16
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,271
Fire!

17
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,531
The gringos are the ones
who use the drugs.

18
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:09,411
So why are we the ones
who need to be extradited?

19
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,541
I mean, all of the problems

20
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,921
are because of those imperialist gringos!

21
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,548
No, stay there. Stay there.

22
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,977
“Better a grave in Colombia
than a grave in the United States.”

23
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,022
I’ve got it, Fabio, I’ve got it.
Let’s see …

24
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:41,652
“Better a grave in Colombia
than a cell in the United States.”

25
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,946
—What do you think?
—I love it.

26
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,614
Very good.

27
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:49,118
And for $50,000 more,
we’ll make your logo.

28
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:51,203
Done.

29
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,833
THE EXTRADITABLES

30
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:12,492
If you speak in favour of extradition,
you will be their puppet,

31
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,912
and that will be your death sentence.

32
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:19,124
I don’t care about the Americans, but I am
still going to support extradition.

33
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,669
Besides, if the gringos want to take away
all the goddamn killers of this country,

34
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,171
then let them take them.

35
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,249
Defendants, please rise.

36
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,796
You’ve been convicted of cocaine traffic
in Colombia and indicted in the US.

37
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:12,844
You will immediately be turned over
to the DEA for extradition to America.

38
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,334
—Thank you for seeing me, General.
—You’re welcome.

39
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:53,004
Listen, I have General Gomez
assigned to the operation against Pablo.

40
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:57,468
With all due respect, General Jaramillo,
I propose Horacio Carrillo.

41
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,512
But Carrillo only acts on his own orders.
He doesn’t follow anyone.

42
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:02,473
Well, I don’t want him to follow.

43
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:05,142
I want him to lead.

44
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,232
Go ahead.

45
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,444
Yes, General.

46
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,695
As you wish.

47
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:18,905
Understood.

48
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,119
What happened, honey?

49
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,996
Things with work.

50
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,290
At what time does Horacio arrive
to have dinner with us?

51
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:32,043
I’m making the chicken he likes,
but he’s out with the girlfriend.

52
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,341
Tell me what’s wrong.

53
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,759
They want me to catch Pablo Escobar.

54
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,684
The Ochoas aren’t happy at all.

55
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:50,688
They are saying that
since you’ve become a wanted man,

56
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,440
bribing the police
has become very costly.

57
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:55,567
They want to renegotiate
the price of our routes.

58
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:02,157
When it came to me killing
to get their sister back, well, then …

59
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,159
I didn’t hear them complaining,
did I?

60
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,911
Yeah. The problem is that
it is one thing to kill communists

61
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,831
—and another to kill politicians.
—So what now?

62
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,752
What I would do better is to increase
the payments to the police, you know?

63
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,128
And most of all, to the top brass.

64
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,632
We’re already giving too much money
to those bastards.

65
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,222
Oh, shit. What’s that?
Is it snowing or what?

66
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,016
Egrets from the Himalayas.

67
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,603
It took two years
to train them to stay there.

68
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,773
They cost me a million dollars.

69
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,031
Bastards.

70
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,744
Stay in the fucking tree!

71
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,339
Seems like you lost that dough,
eh, cousin?

72
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,510
The thing is,
that’s your problem, Pablo.

73
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:06,096
You think that everything
can be controlled,

74
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,682
but it turns out that nature
cannot be controlled.

75
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:12,018
OK, OK, OK, Gustavo. OK.

76
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,372
Hand me that coffee.

77
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,560
But you do know where he is hiding,
don’t you?

78
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,666
Look, little brother …

79
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,003
I know it scares the shit out of you
that Pablo will kill you.

80
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,924
But I will also kill you.

81
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,092
And very slowly.

82
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,305
Pablo is going to kill me more slowly.

83
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:40,018
Well, then, you should pray we find him,
and quickly.

84
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,242
Boss!

85
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,327
Poison …

86
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,703
Boss!

87
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:03,000
They were headed for El Bizcocho,
but they got off the main highway.

88
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,794
—They’re already on their way here.
—How far are they?

89
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,128
Two hours, boss.

90
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:10,674
Round up the guys,
and tell them to get ready.

91
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,676
—We’re leaving.
—All right.

92
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,764
We have to go.

93
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,058
Go where?

94
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,852
The police are coming.

95
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,187
—But Pablo, I’ve been cooking for hours.
—I’m sorry, my love,

96
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,149
—but we need to leave now.
—What about our things? Our clothes?

97
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,109
We’ll buy new ones later, won’t we?

98
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,239
I’m sorry.

99
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,076
Do you hear me complaining?

100
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:46,125
Whenever you are with us, Pablo,
I’m prepared to do whatever it takes.

101
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,137
Bring all of the boxes here.

102
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:02,809
Cangrejo! Go to Pablo’s room
and see if anything is in there.

103
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,061
Efrain!

104
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,730
The two blue notebooks
are the only ones I’m taking.

105
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,904
Search the whole house to make sure
that not a single loose document remains.

106
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,007
What’s wrong, Gustavo?

107
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,468
You fucked us, Pablo.

108
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:41,098
Not only you and me.

109
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,807
You fucked the whole family.

110
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,523
But of course, since you needed
to present yourself to Congress …

111
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,278
since you want to be president
of this motherfucking country,

112
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,697
the rest of us get screwed,
isn’t that right?

113
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,371
But what the fuck …

114
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,208
a man only dies once, right?

115
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,504
Come here.

116
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,554
My brother.

117
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,391
I’m going to let you sit
next to the pilot. Come on, come on.

118
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,562
There we go.

119
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,792
These are from
the narcos’ account in Miami.

120
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:42,713
A cashier’s check
payable to “Ellis McPickle.”

121
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:45,258
Yes.

122
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:50,388
I’ve heard that name mentioned
in some of the narco wiretap transcripts.

123
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:51,973
Obviously, it’s an alias.

124
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,977
No Colombian would go by the name
“Ellis McPickle.”

125
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,313
He’s not Colombian.

126
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:03,901
He’s an American pilot who transports
tons of cocaine for the cartel.

127
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:05,403
A gringo?

128
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,907
—What’s his name?
—We don’t know.

129
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:14,537
But we do know that Gustavo
frequently mentions “McPickle.”

130
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,667
Suarez, do you ever worry
what would happen to you

131
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,046
if Pablo finds out
that you work for both sides?

132
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,757
—I’m on your side.
—Yeah?

133
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,553
Prove it.
What else can you tell me about McPickle?

134
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:36,351
We have his photograph
in some of our files.

135
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:40,063
Maybe you should check with the CIA.
He started his career with them.

136
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,506
Until next time.

137
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,268
Hi, Vanessa.

138
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,816
There’s no way out, Carlitos.
You’re going to Disneyland.

139
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,558
Gentlemen?

140
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,603
Thank you.

141
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,904
What happened to Carlos was terrible.

142
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,200
But I have already presented a motion
before the Supreme Court of Colombia

143
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:34,953
against the legality of extradition.

144
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:39,958
They are examining it this week
at the Palace of Justice.

145
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,628
Can we buy someone in that court?

146
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:45,798
Unfortunately, no.

147
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:49,343
It’s the only institution in this country
that is incorruptible.

148
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:53,430
Let’s pray that the ruling
comes out in our favour.

149
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:56,308
Brother … even after he’s dead,

150
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:59,770
Carlos still has a sentence
of 135 years in prison.

151
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:01,772
He’s totally fucked.

152
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,482
This is gringo bullshit.

153
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:07,361
That happened to him for speaking
about the revolution on the radio.

154
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,697
We’re next, aren’t we?

155
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:11,782
You’re right.

156
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:13,784
Pablito.

157
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:15,369
Do you have an answer or what?

158
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:24,545
Well … in my opinion, a jail
in the United States is worse than death.

159
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:29,258
We can never forget
what happened to Carlos.

160
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,928
Carlos was one of us.

161
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:38,809
Fabio is right.
The Americans are fucking us.

162
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,144
But remember,
they want someone more than they want us.

163
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:44,356
So, brothers …

164
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,860
it’s time to give them what they want,
isn’t it?

165
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:52,322
I didn’t think our paths
would cross again.

166
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:55,701
It’s not so simple, you know?
It’s risky.

167
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:58,621
It’s going to require
more men and weapons.

168
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,163
There will be casualties.

169
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:05,544
I understand what you want.
How much are we talking about?

170
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,171
Two million US dollars.

171
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,050
It’s too dangerous.

172
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:17,014
Fighting a revolution
comes with sacrifice.

173
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,936
It goes without saying,
dangerous or not.

174
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:34,698
For us, brother …

175
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:39,286
it is our duty to fight to the very end.

176
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:44,000
We have an historical obligation.

177
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:46,919
We can’t ignore it.

178
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,848
Meet Pablo Escobar.

179
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:02,935
Miss.

180
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:05,688
—OK.
—We have a deal.

181
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,189
You got it.

182
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:08,858
We were just leaving.

183
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:11,861
Good night.

184
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:21,495
What the hell is this?

185
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,706
Why are you meeting with Escobar?

186
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,749
We made an agreement.

187
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,501
Obviously about money.

188
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,295
In exchange for what?

189
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:34,925
Unless you are willing to be part of it,
I cannot say.

190
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:42,016
It’s a partnership,
necessary for the revolutionary fight.

191
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:46,478
I fight for the people …
not for drug traffickers.

192
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:08,091
They’re looking for us everywhere.

193
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:10,135
What did you expect?

194
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:12,179
That it would be any different?

195
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:18,727
You did a very good job.

196
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:35,994
You can’t imagine how much
this is going to help our cause.

197
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:39,248
No, brother.
The truth is, you helped mine.

198
00:41:42,418 --> 00:41:43,960
You, Ivan …

199
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:48,298
gave me the sword of Simón Bolívar.

200
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:52,844
The same one that freed this country.

201
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,436
Now it belongs to you.

202
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:10,362
With it, you will continue the fight …
to free this country.

203
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:16,534
I promise you, I will continue the fight.

204
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,703
You earned it, brother.

205
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,998
As for me …

206
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:25,335
I’ll be in Panama until this blows over.

207
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,879
We are also--

208
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,386
Make sure you grab the briefcase.

209
00:42:36,138 --> 00:42:37,764
And the fucking sword.
