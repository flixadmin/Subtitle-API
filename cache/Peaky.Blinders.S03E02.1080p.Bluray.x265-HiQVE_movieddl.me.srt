some English tea. Go on.

how come he got invited.

-May I ask your name, sir?
-Shelby.

323
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,800
Thomas Shelby, and in the future
I will be dining here quite a bit.

324
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,000
Then I shall put you
on our special list.

325
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,120
You do that.

326
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,640
Here is a menu.

327
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,720
I recommend the teal and the pork.

328
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,120
Although your guest, I'm sure,
will order the caviar.

329

LEON: Myself and my wife and my niece
travel led by train,

330
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,400
then coach, then on foot
through the Villa Ai-Todor in Crimea.

331
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,040
On that journey I lost a toe.

332
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,240
I don't know, I woke up one morning
and it was gone.

333
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,760
All of a sudden I saw a dog,
and it was eating it.

334
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,600
They said the British
had taken pity on us,

335
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,760
and we were taken aboard
<i>HMS Marlborough.</i>

336
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,280
I immediately kissed the steel deck,
my lips froze to it.

337
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,040
And then, of course, I thanked God
and your King for saving us.

338
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,040
Though since then,
he has done nothing but humiliate me.

339
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,080
Who? God or the King?

340
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,640
Sometimes both, Mr Shelby.

341
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,840
Mmm, so, you met my niece already?

342
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,040
Tatiana.

343
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,120
Are you in love with her yet, hmm?

344
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,880
You would be wise
not to love Russian women, you know.

345
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,880
Ah, better not speak of Russian women.

346
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,840
Mmm... That is the worst thing
about being here.

347
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,840
Russian women, they know how to hold it

348
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,160
and most important,
they know exactly when to let it go.

349
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,760
Your cock, I mean.

350
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,000
English women, they do not know so much.
You know?

351
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,840
Did he die well, the spy?

352
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,960
He begged for his life.

353
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
I heard you had your brother do it.

354
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,480
So you trust your family, like me.

355
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,800
Like us, Mr Shelby.

356
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,520
Let's talk about trust then, shall we?

357

to the Romanovs, you are Georgian.

361

by the British Crown.

362

that you are in some debt.

363

Both here and other places, I imagine.

364
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,360
See, I've been given 10,
but I've been promised 40.

365
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,200
Already, I have had to
have a man killed.

366
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,120
That sort of work does not come cheap.

367
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,960
Do you understand?

368
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,960
Let me tell you something, Mr Shelby.

369
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,960
Before we boarded the ship,

370
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,800
my niece sewed 16 diamonds
into her velvet dress,

371
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,040
and also she had two sapphires
in her intimate places.

372
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,480
My wife managed two sapphires
and five diamonds.

373
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,920
This is already
for the killing of the spy

374
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,200
and a down payment on future services.

375
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,880
Now, tell me,
where do you keep these things?

376
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,280
In a bank?

377
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,560
How could we plead poverty
around London society

378
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,040
if we used banks, Mr Shelby?

379
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,800
Well, you should know...

380
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,520
Hatton Gardens is not safe.

381
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,840
That's why we have our own treasury.

382
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,960

So, should he apologise in Italian

you wanted peace at home.

-Goodness no.

The people I work for just
want me to paint what is there.

656
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,680
To me, politics is deliberately
making things better

657
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,480
for some people by deliberately
making them worse for others.

It's beautiful.

666
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,600
It was made in Paris.

667

from St Mary's Boys Reformatory.

And with him is Mr Patrick Jarvis, MP.

They are part of an organisation
called the Economic League.

set aside at the BSA,

And how will you get it all aboard
the London train?

There will be a strike that night
across the city.

You will have to stop
the train twice. How?

Two drivers will join the strike
at different points.

to help get weapons to the Whites.

What did you say?

800
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,160
Nothing on Earth would make me wear it.

801
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,160
Grace, listen to me.
Look, I can explain.

but you need to take this off.

809
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,000
Why? Because you think
it would look better on her?

810
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,800
Grace, look at me,
fuck these people, eh.

811
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,960
Fuck 'em, I need you to be all right.
