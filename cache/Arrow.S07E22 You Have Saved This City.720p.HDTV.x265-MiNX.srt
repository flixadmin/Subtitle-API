1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,300
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,303 --> 00:00:02,945
I think I finally figured out a plan B

3
00:00:02,948 --> 00:00:05,548
to keep us hidden from Archer
while we try to destroy it.

4
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:07,952
We'd have to steal it
from Keven Dale's computer

5
00:00:07,955 --> 00:00:10,020
in his office at Galaxy One.

6
00:00:10,023 --> 00:00:12,240
Something's come up which
requires my immediate attention.

7
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:13,765
We should get out of here.

8
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:15,143
Seize them.

9
00:00:15,146 --> 00:00:16,965
- Where is William?
- Mom, what's wrong?

10
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:18,109
Frak!

11
00:00:18,112 --> 00:00:19,803
By the authority of Galaxy One,

12
00:00:19,806 --> 00:00:20,872
you are under arrest.

13
00:00:20,874 --> 00:00:22,575
Emiko!

14
00:00:24,184 --> 00:00:25,507
She has the weapon.

15
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,341
And we have no idea
where she's gonna use it.

16
00:00:27,343 --> 00:00:28,398
We'll find her.

17
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:30,568
This is SCPD aerial support.

18
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:32,027
Hold your positions.

19
00:00:35,055 --> 00:00:36,654
Stop right there!

20
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:38,323
We are not the enemy, Lieutenant.

21
00:00:38,325 --> 00:00:39,924
The enemy is still out there,

22
00:00:39,926 --> 00:00:42,260
and we should be working
together, not wasting time.

23
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:44,829
Six arrows and six
dead cops say otherwise.

24
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:46,131
Talk to Sergeant Bingsley.

25
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:47,912
He'll tell you we didn't do this.

26
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,342
Sergeant Bingsley is unconscious

27
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:51,709
in the back of an ambulance right now.

28
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,901
Lieutenant.

29
00:00:52,904 --> 00:00:53,956
Turn around.

30
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:56,074
Put your hands behind your head!

31
00:00:56,076 --> 00:00:58,042
All of you, do it now!

32
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:20,259

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

33
00:01:20,262 --> 00:01:21,709
What do you think is worse,

34
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:23,559
Emiko being in possession of a bioweapon

35
00:01:23,562 --> 00:01:25,490
or the team being Star
City's most wanted?

36
00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:26,545
Can I choose both?

37
00:01:26,548 --> 00:01:28,685
I'm going to go with the
warrants out for our arrest.

38
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,271
The real us, not the vigilante us,

39
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:32,378
which means our lives
in this city are over.

40
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:33,468
Been there before.

41
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:35,480
Guys, this team always
finds a way to come through.

42
00:01:35,482 --> 00:01:36,723
Yeah, but this feels different.

43
00:01:36,725 --> 00:01:38,772
Emiko has a personal vendetta
against you and your whole family.

44
00:01:38,774 --> 00:01:41,386
She has a bigger ax to grind
than Adrian chase or Slade.

45
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:43,363
Fine. But there has to be
a way to get through to her.

46
00:01:43,365 --> 00:01:44,831
And she knows we're alive now.

47
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:46,758
That'll make her even more
determined to destroy the city.

48
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,473
Which means we need to
figure out where in the city

49
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,261
she's planning on deploying the Cygnus.

50
00:01:50,264 --> 00:01:51,538
Yeah. Well, easier said than done,

51
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,331
because Emiko must've found out
that I was tracking the Cygnus

52
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,666
by using its chemical signature

53
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:56,589
because she's figured
out a way to block me,

54
00:01:56,592 --> 00:01:58,092
which brings us back to square one.

55
00:01:58,095 --> 00:01:59,629
Sounds like you all could use some help.

56
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:01,674
It's a good thing you called for backup.

57
00:02:05,162 --> 00:02:10,404
In accordance with Star
City penal code 10101971,

58
00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:11,909
you are all under arrest.

59
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:14,520
Turn around. Put your
hands behind your head.

60
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,937
Ohh. Smoak Tech flex-restraints.

61
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,706
Nice to see another one of my creations

62
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,175
being used against me.

63
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:31,570
And what if we don't want to go quietly?

64
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:35,811
Failure to comply will result

65
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:37,045
in summary execution.

66
00:02:37,048 --> 00:02:39,529
Wrong answer. Hyah!

67
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:50,006
- Alena!
- Uh!

68
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:02,500
They know what we're gonna do...

69
00:03:02,502 --> 00:03:03,823
Even before we do it.

70
00:03:03,826 --> 00:03:05,847
Archer's predictive algorithm!

71
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,207
Hyah!

72
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:35,176
Hey, troublemaker.

73
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:36,378
I had him.

74
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:37,869
You're welcome.

75
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:39,370
We have to find William.

76
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:41,651
Not from here. This place is burned.

77
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,563
I know somewhere that isn't.

78
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:45,733
What are they gonna do with us?

79
00:03:45,736 --> 00:03:47,636
You mean before they
torture us to find out

80
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,979
what you stole off Keven
Dale's computer or after?

81
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:52,592
I'm gonna stop asking questions now.

82
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:54,261
Look, I'm sorry I blew your cover.

83
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:55,477
It's not your fault.

84
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,180
Dale's been suspicious ever since

85
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:59,049
I questioned what they did to Felicity.

86
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:00,886
On the bright side,
I did manage to steal

87
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:03,227
Galaxy One's secret
evil plans for Star City.

88
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:05,401
They plan to use the zetas to establish

89
00:04:05,404 --> 00:04:06,737
martial law

90
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,136
and remake Star City
in The Glades' image.

91
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,316
Which means they're gonna hunt
down everyone with a record

92
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,628
no matter how minor and
kill them on the spot.

93
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:17,375
Which is basically everyone
on that side of the wall.

94
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:19,819
It will be a bloodbath.

95
00:04:28,955 --> 00:04:30,389
Duck.

96
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:37,567
Dad, I was so worried.

97
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,932
We're okay, peanut.

98
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:41,032
We need to get out of here.

99
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:43,612
You're back just in
time for the fun stuff.

100
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:45,336
I'm so happy Roy's back.

101
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:47,271
I love a good reunion.

102
00:04:47,273 --> 00:04:49,089
You seem awfully positive

103
00:04:49,092 --> 00:04:50,775
about the stuff with your sister.

104
00:04:50,777 --> 00:04:53,190
I know how to break my
family's cycle of violence.

105
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,015
Ooh, I hope it goes
something along the lines of

106
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:57,612
stopping Emiko from destroying
the city and killing us all.

107
00:04:57,615 --> 00:04:59,250
That's part one,

108
00:04:59,252 --> 00:05:01,953
but it needs to be more than that.

109
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:05,523
Felicity, I... I want to
help her redeem herself.

110
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:07,592
If I don't break this cycle of violence,

111
00:05:07,594 --> 00:05:10,328
I just don't ever see
us being able to provide

112
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,765
a secure future for our family.

113
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:16,501
Hey. We just got some strange chatter

114
00:05:16,503 --> 00:05:17,735
over the SCPD scanner.

115
00:05:17,737 --> 00:05:19,137
Someone called in a bomb threat

116
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,705
at a shopping complex downtown.

117
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:23,261
Somebody using a signal-bounced
untraceable number.

118
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:24,175
Suspicious.

119
00:05:24,177 --> 00:05:27,214
Why would Emiko give an advance
warning on her own attack?

120
00:05:27,217 --> 00:05:28,112
It doesn't make sense.

121
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:31,206
So that the whole complex will
evacuate into the Plaza outside,

122
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:32,612
where she'll deploy the Cygnus.

123
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:34,440
Maximizing the casualty count.

124
00:05:34,443 --> 00:05:36,254
Well, we can't let that happen.

125
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:38,322
We won't. Let's move out.

126
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:42,579
This place is jammed.

127
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:44,682
Cops, too. This could get messy.

128
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:46,297
That's exactly what Emiko wants.

129
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,167
Overwatch, do you have eyes on?

130
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,970
Okay. Still no sign of
Emiko, but we are tracking

131
00:05:49,972 --> 00:05:51,967
what is most likely a detonation signal

132
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,018
to a package on the
northeast corner of the Plaza.

133
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,292
It's got to be the Cygnus X-1.

134
00:05:55,295 --> 00:05:56,641
All right. We need to
get these people clear

135
00:05:56,643 --> 00:05:58,242
and find that device now.

136
00:05:58,244 --> 00:05:59,310
Copy that.

137
00:05:59,312 --> 00:06:00,845
We're focused on the weapon.

138
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:03,237
Let's get all these people out of here.

139
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,909
Listen up! Everybody move now!

140
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:07,261
We have to go!

141
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:11,307
Move. Hey! If we don't evacuate
this building right now,

142
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,815
all these people are gonna die.

143
00:06:12,818 --> 00:06:15,226
You're the vigilantes who
killed those transit workers.

144
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:17,195
You're under arrest.

145
00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:26,057
All right. Enough. We
don't have time for this.

146
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,239
Stand down.

147
00:06:27,242 --> 00:06:29,925
You should still be
in jail... All of you.

148
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:32,777
We're not gonna stand for this...

149
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:35,613
He's trying to save you, dumbass.

150
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:39,083
Questions later. How can I help?

151
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:40,651
Clear a path.

152
00:07:14,387 --> 00:07:16,318
Aah!

153
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:18,189
Overwatch, what happens to the Cygnus

154
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:19,490
if I shoot it down?

155
00:07:19,492 --> 00:07:21,175
An accelerant will augment the effects.

156
00:07:21,178 --> 00:07:22,528
You need to freeze them.

157
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:31,440
It worked! The Cygnus didn't spread.

158
00:07:31,443 --> 00:07:33,097
You got all of them. You contained it.

159
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,599
Not fast enough.

160
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:43,387
Star City is reeling tonight

161
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,621
following a horrific terrorist attack

162
00:07:45,624 --> 00:07:48,973
perpetrated by its own
heroes, which injured hundreds.

163
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:52,107
The vigilantes' motives
are still in question.

164
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,577
I cannot believe they still
think we're behind this

165
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:56,579
after everything we've
done for this city.

166
00:07:56,581 --> 00:08:00,504
Well, not everyone. I'm out
on parole thanks to you guys.

167
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:02,774
Look, I know tonight
didn't go as planned.

168
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:04,040
That's an understatement.

169
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:05,421
That doesn't mean it's over.

170
00:08:05,423 --> 00:08:06,809
You can't possibly think

171
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:08,690
Emiko could have a change of heart.

172
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:10,035
Oliver's right.

173
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:14,196
What? I'm happy that you two
are on the same side finally.

174
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,965
But how can you be siding with the woman

175
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:17,734
who tried to destroy your life?

176
00:08:17,736 --> 00:08:20,903
She actually did me a favor.

177
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:23,906
If I hadn't had toyed around
with being Black Siren again,

178
00:08:23,908 --> 00:08:25,402
then I never would have realized

179
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,301
that that's not the
life that I want to live.

180
00:08:27,304 --> 00:08:29,637
Maybe Emiko will have
the same realization.

181
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,950
If people were correct in their thinking

182
00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:32,304
that Laurel and I couldn't change,

183
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:34,583
well, we wouldn't be here helping you.

184
00:08:34,586 --> 00:08:35,926
I hope you guys are right

185
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:38,946
because Emiko only used
a fraction of the Cygnus.

186
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:41,637
She has a lot of scary
nightmare bacteria left.

187
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,426
Any idea where she
may be targeting next?

188
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,894
At the moment, everywhere.

189
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:46,513
The detonation signal's
been purposely scrambled,

190
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:47,841
which means the target keeps moving.

191
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:50,098
Yeah. It's like a whack-a-Cygnus.

192
00:08:50,101 --> 00:08:52,559
Ha ha! Ohh, I missed you.

193
00:08:52,562 --> 00:08:54,429
Our descrambling algorithm is working,

194
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:56,772
but it's going to be slower than normal.

195
00:08:56,775 --> 00:08:58,168
Even if you find the targets,

196
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,575
we still need to find a way to
contain the drones at each site.

197
00:09:00,577 --> 00:09:02,644
Are you all familiar with the term

198
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:04,747
"Optimized Cryogenic Chambers"?

199
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:05,926
Oh, no, they aren't.

200
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,194
Yeah. It's just us? Okay.

201
00:09:07,197 --> 00:09:09,451
Basically I was able to modify

202
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:11,421
an old portable freezing device

203
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,759
so that it can contain
the Cygnus on the drones.

204
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,188
Good thing you guys didn't toss
all of my old tech equipment

205
00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:17,693
when you did the new bunker upgrades,

206
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:19,096
which, by the way, are very cool, so...

207
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:20,704
- Right?
- Okay, look...

208
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:22,665
Uh, it's not that I don't
have faith in this team,

209
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:25,101
but if this scary bacteria
gets all over the city,

210
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:27,024
I got to get Zoe somewhere safe.

211
00:09:27,027 --> 00:09:29,439
Okay. Well, Lyla took J.J. to
a secure A.R.G.U.S. location.

212
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:31,207
She can pick up Zoe as well.

213
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:33,076
You have a son, right? Connor?

214
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:34,944
- Yeah.
- We'll bring him as well.

215
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:36,027
Thank you.

216
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,746
Jackpot. I got two detonation sites.

217
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:39,950
Okay, Digg, Turner, and I will
go to the water treatment plant.

218
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:41,951
Roy, Dinah, Laurel, you go
to the convention center.

219
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:43,319
All right. And I will
stay here with Felicity.

220
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:44,660
All right. No one die.

221
00:09:44,663 --> 00:09:48,424
- "No"... wow. What?
- Uh, I'm rusty. Sorry.

222
00:09:48,426 --> 00:09:50,282
Well, I'm glad everyone is safe

223
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:51,277
to say the least.

224
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,933
Does anyone need anything?
Do we need any water?

225
00:09:52,935 --> 00:09:54,044
It's very important to hydrate.

226
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:56,090
No. And we don't need any snacks either.

227
00:09:56,093 --> 00:09:57,106
According to the information

228
00:09:57,108 --> 00:09:59,113
William got on Dale's
computer, the ZETAs

229
00:09:59,116 --> 00:10:00,801
are marching into Star City tonight.

230
00:10:00,804 --> 00:10:03,206
We have to disable Archer before
they start their mass execution.

231
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,474
That won't be easy.

232
00:10:04,476 --> 00:10:05,899
Archer doesn't have a server room.

233
00:10:05,902 --> 00:10:07,210
Its server is the actual wall

234
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:08,845
outside of The Glades.

235
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:11,149
Wait. The ZETAs use
Archer to track our DNA.

236
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,419
They'll know the second we get
anywhere close to that wall.

237
00:10:13,421 --> 00:10:14,793
- Mom...
- Hmm?

238
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:16,128
Why are you making that face?

239
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:17,449
I am not making a face.

240
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:19,923
This is my face.

241
00:10:19,926 --> 00:10:21,257
I might have put a backdoor into Archer

242
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:22,692
that utilizes Queen/Smoak DNA

243
00:10:22,694 --> 00:10:25,061
so that you wouldn't be in the system.

244
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:26,762
So you basically just erased me.

245
00:10:26,764 --> 00:10:27,840
I...

246
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:29,398
You know, just add that
to the list of lies.

247
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,067
I was protecting you.

248
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:32,184
Wait. Hold on.

249
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:33,980
Yes, what she did may be overprotective

250
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:35,508
- and overbearing...
- Yeah.

251
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,641
But it could be the break
that we've been waiting for.

252
00:10:37,644 --> 00:10:39,809
I mean, if Archer doesn't
recognize Mia's DNA,

253
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:41,511
she could be the key
to shutting it down.

254
00:10:41,513 --> 00:10:43,513
You're right. If Archer inputs your DNA,

255
00:10:43,515 --> 00:10:45,114
it theoretically creates an opening

256
00:10:45,116 --> 00:10:46,382
for a virus to be uploaded.

257
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:47,786
I mean, I don't know if it would work.

258
00:10:47,788 --> 00:10:49,614
Well, even if it did,
Archer only inputs data

259
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,191
to its main server at one location...

260
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:53,829
The checkpoint between
Star City and The Glades.

261
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:54,821
That's where Dale plans

262
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:56,591
to march the zetas into Star City.

263
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:58,461
So we go there, we scan Mia's DNA,

264
00:10:58,463 --> 00:10:59,894
we upload the virus.

265
00:10:59,897 --> 00:11:01,681
Even with the Archer
blindspots put in place,

266
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:03,129
we're way too publicly recognizable

267
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:04,751
to get anywhere near that checkpoint.

268
00:11:04,754 --> 00:11:08,104
I mean, you can't, but we can.

269
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:09,605
- No.
- Uh, the... the public

270
00:11:09,607 --> 00:11:11,107
doesn't even know who we are.

271
00:11:11,109 --> 00:11:12,508
No. It is much too dangerous.

272
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,711
Mom, you've trained me
my whole life for this.

273
00:11:15,713 --> 00:11:18,114
Trust me.

274
00:11:18,116 --> 00:11:19,582
Got to hand it to you, Curtis.

275
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:21,236
Your containment chamber
worked like a charm.

276
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:23,119
Nice to know you still
think I'm terrific. Heh!

277
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:24,348
Heard it. That was bad.

278
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,321
Any luck unscrambling
the detonation signal?

279
00:11:26,324 --> 00:11:28,122
Dinah started transmission
at the convention center.

280
00:11:28,124 --> 00:11:31,152
Her data plus your
data should do the trick

281
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:33,019
and help us identify the targets.

282
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:35,031
Okay, perfect. If we can
neutralize the rest of the Cygnus,

283
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:36,730
then we can turn our
focus back to Emiko.

284
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:37,864
Uh-oh.

285
00:11:39,444 --> 00:11:40,394
What's happening?

286
00:11:40,397 --> 00:11:42,975
Okay, so we have a good
news/ bad news situation

287
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:44,152
going on here, guys,

288
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:46,712
the bad news being we
just got 15 new targets.

289
00:11:46,715 --> 00:11:48,676
We don't have time to
neutralize that many.

290
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,667
We might not have to.

291
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,080
All the Cygnus devices are
linked up to the same detonator.

292
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,536
- That was the good news, right?
- Uh-huh.

293
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:54,590
Ok, well, if we destroy the detonator,

294
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:56,138
we can neutralize the
rest of the targets.

295
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,871
I'm working on a location for you now.

296
00:11:57,874 --> 00:11:59,956
Oh, double frak.

297
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,591
It's at Palmer Tech.

298
00:12:01,593 --> 00:12:04,327
Formerly Queen consolidated,
our father's company.

299
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:07,296
She wants to tear down
our family's legacy.

300
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:10,144
This is her target.

301
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,863
Call the team.

302
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:13,632
Two of the Cygnus dispersement sites

303
00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:16,805
have been compromised.

304
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:20,777
The circle, they're concerned.

305
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:23,285
Look, they want to detonate

306
00:12:23,288 --> 00:12:25,680
the remaining devices now.

307
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:27,516
That isn't the plan.

308
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:28,951
The plan was only to profit

309
00:12:28,953 --> 00:12:30,786
on the destruction of Star City.

310
00:12:30,788 --> 00:12:33,856
I mean, this extra chaos is unnecessary,

311
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:36,793
especially now with
the D.I.A. closing in.

312
00:12:38,773 --> 00:12:40,674
Chaos is the point.

313
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,105
Without terror, there is no profit.

314
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:48,522
The Circle respectfully disagrees,

315
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:50,959
and they worry that your
focus on your brother

316
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:52,465
has led to our exposure.

317
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:55,194
Your personal vendetta is only
drawing more attention to us.

318
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:57,130
I think you...

319
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:59,033
And the circle

320
00:12:59,036 --> 00:13:01,540
have forgotten who their leader is.

321
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:04,754
My brother deserves to suffer

322
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:07,465
just like I have suffered
all of these years.

323
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:09,268
And when he sees his city burn

324
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:11,726
with his family to blame,

325
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:14,324
he will.

326
00:13:20,482 --> 00:13:21,882
Overwatch, we're on-site.

327
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,103
We're in the telecom suite.

328
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:25,218
B.C., Laurel, and Wild
Dog are still en route.

329
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,808
I'm picking up over a
hundred heat signatures

330
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,710
in the building, including the penthouse
that is still under construction.

331
00:13:29,712 --> 00:13:32,746
One guess as to where your sister is.

332
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:33,881
She really knows how to maximize

333
00:13:33,883 --> 00:13:35,369
collateral damage, doesn't she?

334
00:13:35,372 --> 00:13:37,591
If we try to evacuate the
civilians, we'll blow our cover.

335
00:13:37,593 --> 00:13:38,617
We need to find that relay trigger

336
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:40,225
before the ninth
circle knows we're here.

337
00:13:40,228 --> 00:13:42,022
Actually, just the device
relaying the signal.

338
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:43,758
There's a power surge coming
from the room you're in,

339
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,223
so the relay must be somewhere nearby.

340
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,860
We shut down Emiko's
ability to detonate,

341
00:13:46,862 --> 00:13:48,397
we save the city.

342
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:52,960
Find the relay device

343
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:55,131
and then evacuate the building.

344
00:13:56,772 --> 00:13:58,138
You going after Emiko?

345
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,606
I've got your back.

346
00:13:59,608 --> 00:14:02,342
Got to go alone.

347
00:14:02,344 --> 00:14:05,199
Communication is mission critical.

348
00:14:05,202 --> 00:14:06,980
The last thing we need are comms failing

349
00:14:06,983 --> 00:14:08,175
while we're out there.

350
00:14:08,178 --> 00:14:09,980
While we're out there?

351
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,718
Sounds like you still haven't budged

352
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,387
on Mia and William taking the reins.

353
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:14,955
We are about to stop a small army

354
00:14:14,957 --> 00:14:16,280
from infiltrating Star City.

355
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:18,091
I can't be the only one
worried about the kids.

356
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:19,327
Of course I'm worried,

357
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,027
but I taught Zoe everything she knows

358
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,696
about being a hero.

359
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:24,064
Almost everything.

360
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:26,105
And now my little
girl's a grown-ass woman

361
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:27,382
and one of the Canaries.

362
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:29,218
I know she can handle herself.

363
00:14:29,221 --> 00:14:32,505
And your kids, they're no
slouches either, Felicity.

364
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:33,874
They're like their parents.

365
00:14:33,877 --> 00:14:35,434
This is not the life

366
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:36,843
that Oliver and I wanted for them.

367
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:38,178
They're supposed to be living

368
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,530
happy, normal lives right now.

369
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:41,796
That was the only thing
that Oliver asked me to do.

370
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,565
It was the only thing that I

371
00:14:43,568 --> 00:14:46,318
promised him I would do.

372
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:50,623
And I failed.

373
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:52,527
Some mother I turned out to be.

374
00:14:53,862 --> 00:14:55,596
It's time.

375
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:57,655
Be safe. I love you.

376
00:14:57,658 --> 00:14:58,874
I love you, too, dad.

377
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:00,824
I'm going to be watching
over both of you.

378
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:02,437
We'll need you.

379
00:15:13,616 --> 00:15:15,416
Mia...

380
00:15:17,152 --> 00:15:19,220
Thought you might need these.

381
00:16:33,762 --> 00:16:36,129
What happened to us being
public enemy number one?

382
00:16:36,131 --> 00:16:37,297
I told pollard the truth

383
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:38,665
about what really went down.

384
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:39,882
You guys are heroes.

385
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:41,134
Is the relay down, Overwatch?

386
00:16:41,136 --> 00:16:42,957
Oh, so down, it's in Australia.

387
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,847
Emiko can't trigger the devices now.

388
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,207
Every remote device.

389
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,536
There's still an active
one in the building.

390
00:16:47,538 --> 00:16:48,809
Enough to take this place down?

391
00:16:48,811 --> 00:16:50,110
And then some.

392
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:51,878
We need to evacuate this building now.

393
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,425
You heard the captain. Move!

394
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:55,115
Oliver, the relay's deactivated,

395
00:16:55,117 --> 00:16:59,553
but the building is still
armed. Do you have Emiko?

396
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:00,913
I do now.

397
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:08,129
I have been waiting for you.

398
00:17:13,752 --> 00:17:15,185
Emiko, it's over.

399
00:17:15,187 --> 00:17:18,421
This was his view, wasn't it?

400
00:17:18,423 --> 00:17:19,923
Your father.

401
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:23,927
His perch above the
city, above everyone.

402
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:26,730
I'm glad you'll get to see it all fall.

403
00:17:26,732 --> 00:17:28,299
Not tonight.

404
00:17:32,905 --> 00:17:35,238
What did you do?

405
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,240
I'm giving you a second chance...

406
00:17:37,242 --> 00:17:39,876
Before it's too late for both of us.

407
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:42,179
I don't need bombs to kill you.

408
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,952
Welcome to Galaxy One.

409
00:17:48,954 --> 00:17:51,655
Proceed to checkpoint.

410
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:53,790
This couldn't be creepier.

411
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:55,191
Just keep your heads down.

412
00:17:55,193 --> 00:17:56,726
Once the scan starts, it'll only take

413
00:17:56,728 --> 00:17:58,361
a few seconds to upload the virus.

414
00:17:58,363 --> 00:18:00,164
Proceed.

415
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,936
Prepare for identification.

416
00:18:07,706 --> 00:18:10,240
Done. Let's get out of here.

417
00:18:10,242 --> 00:18:13,574
Mr. Clayton. What a surprise.

418
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:15,629
I thought you'd be smarter than this.

419
00:18:15,632 --> 00:18:19,283
Turns out you're just like your father.

420
00:18:20,677 --> 00:18:23,179
Looks like you're having
technical difficulties.

421
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,666
No, no, no.

422
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:29,835
Don't tell me you
actually liked that creep.

423
00:18:29,838 --> 00:18:31,238
No, it didn't work.

424
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:32,729
The virus didn't destroy Archer.

425
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:35,726
It's rebooting itself. We failed.

426
00:18:39,638 --> 00:18:42,006
You have every right to be angry.

427
00:18:49,815 --> 00:18:51,915
I was angry, too,

428
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:54,317
because you let our father die.

429
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,199
And that led to a ripple
effect in my life of loss.

430
00:18:57,202 --> 00:19:00,790
I lost Tommy, my
mother, Laurel, Quentin.

431
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:03,793
And I wanted to kill you for all of it.

432
00:19:03,795 --> 00:19:05,997
Hyah! Hyah...

433
00:19:14,306 --> 00:19:17,408
I know his death affected you, too.

434
00:19:20,946 --> 00:19:22,445
Instead of finding the hero

435
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:25,749
that I really believe is inside of you,

436
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:29,019
you went down a dark path.

437
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:30,787
And it killed your mother.

438
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:32,555
Dante killed my mother.

439
00:19:32,557 --> 00:19:34,691
No, he didn't, Emiko.

440
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:37,637
Your allegiance to the Ninth
Circle killed your mother.

441
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,730
Your hatred of our
father killed your mother.

442
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:43,500
His worst impulses drove you away,

443
00:19:43,502 --> 00:19:49,072
and it led to every terrible
moment in both of our lives.

444
00:19:49,074 --> 00:19:51,942
I think that together, we can be better.

445
00:19:55,013 --> 00:20:00,017
So if you're gonna kill me, do it.

446
00:20:05,257 --> 00:20:07,934
Well, if you're not gonna kill him,

447
00:20:07,937 --> 00:20:10,593
we'll gladly oblige.

448
00:20:10,595 --> 00:20:12,566
Galaxy One must have found a weak spot

449
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:13,663
and modified the system.

450
00:20:13,665 --> 00:20:15,632
Okay. How long until the
ZETAs are back online?

451
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:18,022
Uh, best-case scenario, 5 minutes?

452
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:20,135
Dad, you said the brain
of Archer is in the wall,

453
00:20:20,138 --> 00:20:21,749
so if we destroy the wall?

454
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:22,679
When we built the wall,

455
00:20:22,682 --> 00:20:23,815
we installed explosives

456
00:20:23,818 --> 00:20:25,083
inside of each control tower.

457
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:26,897
They're linked together electronically,

458
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,129
but they can only be detonated
from inside one of the towers.

459
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:32,301
Yeah, but there's no way
anyone can make it up there

460
00:20:32,304 --> 00:20:33,515
in 4 minutes.

461
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:34,866
An Archer could.

462
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:37,074
No way, Mia. Look.

463
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:39,310
Even if you got up there, you wouldn't
be able to make it back down in time.

464
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:40,423
You'll die.

465
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:42,792
Once I'm inside the tower,
can you talk me through it?

466
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:44,494
You know it's the only way.

467
00:20:44,496 --> 00:20:47,163
If you can get inside, I can
access the system remotely.

468
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:50,366
- Mia, listen to me!
- Sorry, Mom. I have to do this.

469
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:55,374
Beatrice, you don't have
the authority to be here.

470
00:20:55,377 --> 00:20:56,632
The council was promised

471
00:20:56,635 --> 00:20:59,108
the total destruction of Star City,

472
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:00,944
not a sibling spat.

473
00:21:00,946 --> 00:21:02,554
And for the first time in history,

474
00:21:02,557 --> 00:21:04,446
the world knows of our existence.

475
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:06,550
The Ninth Circle answers to me.

476
00:21:08,312 --> 00:21:10,015
Not anymore.

477
00:21:13,658 --> 00:21:15,092
Finish them.

478
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:20,296
Almost in position.

479
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:22,768
Ready when you are.

480
00:21:42,254 --> 00:21:43,546
You're still here.

481
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:45,350
Yeah. I don't leave my family.

482
00:21:57,822 --> 00:21:59,155
Detonate the building.

483
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:05,142
Aah!

484
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:22,788
Aah!

485
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,649
Aah!

486
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,713
Okay. The device is installed.

487
00:22:44,716 --> 00:22:47,150
Now all I have to do is bypass
the encryption protocols,

488
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:49,252
reconfigure the detonation commands,

489
00:22:49,254 --> 00:22:51,287
and voila.

490
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,161
Ready when you are.

491
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:04,894
Take care of mom.

492
00:23:04,897 --> 00:23:07,504
She's already lost so much.

493
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:11,175
Here goes nothing.

494
00:23:15,313 --> 00:23:17,309
I just started getting
used to having a sister.

495
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,715
I'm not losing you now.

496
00:23:18,717 --> 00:23:21,098
You have 60 seconds
until that wall goes boom.

497
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:22,432
Get out of there.

498
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:29,791
I'm sorry.

499
00:23:29,794 --> 00:23:31,394
I know. It's okay.

500
00:23:31,396 --> 00:23:34,264
You need to hide.

501
00:23:37,335 --> 00:23:41,571
Your family's gonna
die. I made sure of it.

502
00:23:41,573 --> 00:23:45,575
You need to hide Felicity and the baby.

503
00:23:46,745 --> 00:23:47,911
Emiko.

504
00:23:47,913 --> 00:23:51,374
I... I...

505
00:23:51,377 --> 00:23:56,257
I wanted to be a Queen.

506
00:24:11,178 --> 00:24:12,553
Aah!

507
00:24:12,556 --> 00:24:15,091
Uh-oh. The ZETAs are back online.

508
00:24:17,976 --> 00:24:20,143
You think?

509
00:24:20,145 --> 00:24:22,241
You have 20 seconds.

510
00:24:58,684 --> 00:25:01,340
So this is what it feels
like to save a city,

511
00:25:01,343 --> 00:25:03,768
minus Palmer Tech becoming a crater.

512
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:06,080
No civilian casualties. That's a win.

513
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:08,478
We really couldn't have
done this without your help.

514
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:10,177
Thank you.

515
00:25:11,646 --> 00:25:13,913
Laurel, thank you.

516
00:25:13,915 --> 00:25:15,714
That last-minute SCPD assist

517
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:16,942
really helped turn the tide.

518
00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:18,754
Oh, well, I'm just
relieved the department's

519
00:25:18,757 --> 00:25:20,423
back on our side and
we can show our faces

520
00:25:20,426 --> 00:25:21,770
- in the city again.
- Yeah.

521
00:25:21,773 --> 00:25:24,609
Because you proved this
is a team of heroes.

522
00:25:26,694 --> 00:25:29,061
I'm sorry about Emiko.

523
00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:32,270
Thank you. I... I know
I tried to save her.

524
00:25:32,273 --> 00:25:37,269
Oliver, I know this wasn't how
you wanted her story to end.

525
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:39,856
Hey. I'm sorry. I hate to save and run.

526
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:41,631
- Ohh.
- But I have to go back to D.C.

527
00:25:41,634 --> 00:25:42,731
The jeweler called.

528
00:25:42,734 --> 00:25:44,434
The ring I picked out for Nick is ready.

529
00:25:44,437 --> 00:25:46,427
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You're popping the question?

530
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:48,247
Yeah. The holtnastases
are gonna make it official,

531
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:49,449
assuming he says yes.

532
00:25:49,452 --> 00:25:51,252
Of course he'll say yes!
He'd be a fool not to. Oh!

533
00:25:51,254 --> 00:25:52,496
Congratulations.

534
00:25:52,499 --> 00:25:54,130
Any thoughts about what
you're gonna do next?

535
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:55,169
A man with your set of skills,

536
00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:56,655
a lot of people will be looking.

537
00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:58,057
Lyla... well, she's always looking.

538
00:25:58,059 --> 00:25:59,809
I just want to spend time with my son,

539
00:25:59,812 --> 00:26:01,387
who I need to get back to.

540
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,457
- Copy that.
- All right.

541
00:26:07,268 --> 00:26:10,502
And then there were six.

542
00:26:10,504 --> 00:26:14,607
Actually, five. I can't stay.

543
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:15,975
You're gonna catch up with Thea?

544
00:26:15,977 --> 00:26:18,644
There's a lot I still
have to figure out.

545
00:26:18,646 --> 00:26:20,479
I killed two innocent people.

546
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:22,579
I have to find a way to atone for that.

547
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:24,130
Well, since we're on
the subject of good-byes,

548
00:26:24,132 --> 00:26:25,756
we have an announcement, too.

549
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:26,792
Hmm?

550
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,453
We're stepping back.

551
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:30,473
We're leaving Star City. Not forever,

552
00:26:30,476 --> 00:26:32,285
but, uh, for now.

553
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:33,488
You just saved the city.

554
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,857
You don't want to take a victory lap?

555
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:37,528
I didn't do anything.

556
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:39,298
Our team did.

557
00:26:39,301 --> 00:26:41,044
The fact that the city is safe is

558
00:26:41,047 --> 00:26:42,559
the reason why we can leave.

559
00:26:42,562 --> 00:26:44,495
I've spent a long time thinking about

560
00:26:44,498 --> 00:26:46,466
my legacy as the Green Arrow.

561
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:51,811
I always hoped it would
be saving the city.

562
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:57,250
But now I know that
my greatest legacy...

563
00:26:58,619 --> 00:26:59,965
Is this team.

564
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,559
I started this mission alone.

565
00:27:01,562 --> 00:27:04,396
I was certain that I would end it alone,

566
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:07,158
but the truth of the matter is that

567
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:10,863
every bit of success that
I've had along the way

568
00:27:10,865 --> 00:27:12,442
is because of all of you.

569
00:27:12,445 --> 00:27:14,196
The city is safe
because of your courage,

570
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,207
your compassion, your selflessness,

571
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,285
and your loyalty.

572
00:27:17,288 --> 00:27:20,756
Courage, compassion,
selflessness, loyalty.

573
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:23,875
Oliver, that sounds like the
4 pillars of heroism to me.

574
00:27:23,878 --> 00:27:26,245
We should find a way to remember them

575
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:29,381
to symbolize we will all be
there for each other always

576
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:30,520
no matter what.

577
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,168
Ooh, like a signal, you know.

578
00:27:32,171 --> 00:27:34,738
One of us is in trouble,
we'll all come running,

579
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:37,609
including you, Roy.

580
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:40,337
We should just call it
the mark of four, right?

581
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,652
That's brilliant.

582
00:27:41,655 --> 00:27:43,393
Man, I really hope
this isn't the last time

583
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,895
we're all in this bunker together.

584
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:46,364
Hear! Hear!

585
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:48,715
But it does feel like the end of an era.

586
00:27:48,718 --> 00:27:51,231
Okay, well, let's
just try to think of it

587
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:52,917
as the beginning of a new one.

588
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:18,395
Star City is a wall-free zone once again.

589
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:20,265
Restoring The Glades won't be easy.

590
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:23,454
The Glades hasn't been
open to outsiders in years.

591
00:28:23,457 --> 00:28:25,942
Plenty of people will be
trying to take advantage.

592
00:28:25,945 --> 00:28:27,598
Seems like the city's gonna need heroes.

593
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:28,957
We were thinking the same thing.

594
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,996
The four of you are the
heroes that the city needs.

595
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:32,198
What are you talking about?

596
00:28:32,201 --> 00:28:33,334
Passing the torch.

597
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:34,879
Zoe, you are a born leader.

598
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:36,652
And I think you are more than ready

599
00:28:36,655 --> 00:28:38,716
to rebuild and take
control of the Canaries.

600
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:40,004
I don't understand.

601
00:28:40,007 --> 00:28:41,940
Someone's gonna get
blamed for what happened.

602
00:28:41,943 --> 00:28:43,076
It should be us.

603
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,356
You'll be fugitives.

604
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,991
We've spent the last two
decades living in hiding.

605
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:49,059
Going off-grid won't be new for us.

606
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:50,861
Wait. I just got you back.

607
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:52,731
I'm so sorry,

608
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:55,535
but the four of you having a future,

609
00:28:55,538 --> 00:28:58,940
that's worth any sacrifice.

610
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:06,465
Thank you, both of you.

611
00:29:06,468 --> 00:29:09,447
I should be thanking you.
You got me off that island.

612
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,821
You never really told me
how you got on that island.

613
00:29:11,824 --> 00:29:15,418
It's a long story. Look,
we should really get going.

614
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,379
Um, I'll catch up with the two of you.

615
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,849
There's something I have to
do before we say good-bye...

616
00:29:19,852 --> 00:29:21,552
Something to honor your father.

617
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:29,501
You having second thoughts?

618
00:29:29,503 --> 00:29:31,837
- Ahh.
- No.

619
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:34,139
Right. Yeah. Me either.

620
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:36,842
It's the right thing to do

621
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:38,582
for our family.

622
00:29:38,585 --> 00:29:40,679
I do wish we could tell
the team about the...

623
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:41,529
Yeah.

624
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:45,220
Baby, but I understand it just

625
00:29:45,223 --> 00:29:48,262
puts them in the Ninth
Circle's crosshairs.

626
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:50,533
When that threat is over.

627
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,561
Until then, it's the
best thing for them...

628
00:29:55,563 --> 00:29:57,297
And us.

629
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:01,954
You know, the spirit of this place

630
00:30:01,957 --> 00:30:04,002
will live on long after we're gone.

631
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:06,473
You've inspired so many people, Oliver.

632
00:30:07,634 --> 00:30:09,568
They will carry on your legacy.

633
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:11,527
Sounds like a cycle for good.

634
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,263
Far better than that.

635
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:15,033
A cycle of heroes...

636
00:30:17,251 --> 00:30:20,085
Who will fight to defend this city

637
00:30:20,087 --> 00:30:23,056
with every fiber of their being.

638
00:30:25,525 --> 00:30:27,892
Anyone ever told you you
always know exactly what to say?

639
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:28,957
I have been told.

640
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,560
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!

641
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,647
Mm.

642
00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:46,746
Let's get you two to your new home.

643
00:30:55,077 --> 00:30:58,013
Good-bye, old friend.

644
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:16,948
Well, it's not Ivy town, but it'll work.

645
00:31:16,951 --> 00:31:18,866
Well, it's temporary.

646
00:31:18,868 --> 00:31:20,800
Well, basically, this
whole neighborhood is

647
00:31:20,803 --> 00:31:24,550
ex-C.I.A., ex D.I.A., and ex-A.R.G.U.S.

648
00:31:24,553 --> 00:31:26,974
This is one big safe house.
You two will be fine here.

649
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,412
Please thank Lyla for us.

650
00:31:28,415 --> 00:31:29,576
Of course.

651
00:31:29,578 --> 00:31:31,311
Well, I guess this is home now.

652
00:31:31,313 --> 00:31:33,090
At least until the threat
against our baby girl

653
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:34,716
is taken care of.

654
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,852
Your baby girl? You're having a girl.

655
00:31:38,854 --> 00:31:39,820
Mia.

656
00:31:39,822 --> 00:31:43,357
Mia. That's beautiful.

657
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,492
It's beautiful.

658
00:31:45,494 --> 00:31:50,497
Well, I guess since the
city's in good hands now,

659
00:31:50,499 --> 00:31:54,101
you two can focus on your family,

660
00:31:54,103 --> 00:31:56,737
which is exactly what you should do.

661
00:31:56,739 --> 00:31:59,907
Well, you are part of that family, John.

662
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:02,620
Maybe it's the pregnancy
making me overly emotional,

663
00:32:02,623 --> 00:32:06,146
but, oh, I'm gonna miss you so much.

664
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:08,216
We love you.

665
00:32:09,752 --> 00:32:11,419
I love you.

666
00:32:12,955 --> 00:32:14,097
And you.

667
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,823
Yeah.

668
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,927
I'll reach out to you two later.

669
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:22,362
Hey. You maintain my bunker.

670
00:32:22,364 --> 00:32:23,873
No food by the monitors.

671
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:26,444
There's nothing worse
than crumbs in a keyboard.

672
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:32,639
What now?

673
00:32:32,641 --> 00:32:34,808
Well, this isn't a tropical paradise,

674
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,879
but we never did take our honeymoon.

675
00:33:40,075 --> 00:33:44,812
Oh. Yes. Mom juice. Mm.

676
00:33:46,949 --> 00:33:49,750
Ahh. You know,

677
00:33:49,752 --> 00:33:51,618
as much as I miss the team

678
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,519
and the action of
taking down the bad guys,

679
00:33:54,522 --> 00:33:58,862
- this has been so nice.
- Yeah.

680
00:33:58,865 --> 00:34:00,327
I wish William were here.

681
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,209
Me, too.

682
00:34:02,212 --> 00:34:04,864
You know, if this is
gonna be the new normal,

683
00:34:04,867 --> 00:34:08,792
we should talk with his grandparents

684
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:10,597
about getting shared custody.

685
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,513
Yeah. I would love that.

686
00:34:13,516 --> 00:34:16,117
Mia's gonna need her older brother.

687
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:38,399
Now?

688
00:34:39,802 --> 00:34:41,668
I thought I had more time.

689
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,304
The universe is a complex
piece of machinery,

690
00:34:44,306 --> 00:34:47,474
and balance must be maintained.

691
00:34:47,476 --> 00:34:50,644
One change requires another.

692
00:34:50,646 --> 00:34:54,195
How would you propose
I keep the balance?

693
00:34:54,198 --> 00:34:57,995
Will you help me save
Barry and Kara or not?

694
00:34:57,998 --> 00:35:00,921
No. But I will give you
the means to save them.

695
00:35:00,923 --> 00:35:02,834
Tell me what you need in exchange.

696
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:04,831
Whatever the multiverse requires

697
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:08,829
to survive the crisis that is looming.

698
00:35:08,831 --> 00:35:10,731
When it is time.

699
00:35:13,836 --> 00:35:15,737
It's okay.

700
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:32,419
So what bargain have I made?

701
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,054
What does the multiverse require?

702
00:35:34,056 --> 00:35:35,503
You assist me as we seek

703
00:35:35,506 --> 00:35:37,190
to prevent the inevitable.

704
00:35:37,192 --> 00:35:39,339
But that sounds impossible.

705
00:35:39,342 --> 00:35:42,329
The multiverse is more
complex than you could fathom.

706
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:44,206
What are you not telling me?

707
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:46,042
I've seen your future, Oliver,

708
00:35:46,045 --> 00:35:48,003
inexorable and unavoidable.

709
00:35:48,006 --> 00:35:49,737
I have watched you die.

710
00:35:52,245 --> 00:35:54,212
During this crisis?

711
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:58,807
I am truly sorry.

712
00:36:00,928 --> 00:36:03,128
No. You are not taking him.

713
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:04,717
- Felicity.
- Oliver.

714
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,153
I am not here to bring harm
to you or your daughter.

715
00:36:07,156 --> 00:36:08,776
Trust me, the world needs her.

716
00:36:08,779 --> 00:36:10,317
You think that I'm just
going to let you leave here

717
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:11,959
with my husband's life?

718
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:16,347
This is bigger than us...

719
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,465
Than all of us.

720
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,367
Why does it always have to be you?

721
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:23,022
I cannot prevent his passing,

722
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:24,971
but he can prevent the deaths

723
00:36:24,973 --> 00:36:27,441
of countless more, including you

724
00:36:27,443 --> 00:36:30,377
and your daughter.

725
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:32,914
But he needs to come with me tonight.

726
00:36:38,535 --> 00:36:40,102
Mom?

727
00:36:40,105 --> 00:36:42,888
- Hi.
- Are you okay?

728
00:36:42,891 --> 00:36:45,425
Yeah.

729
00:36:47,062 --> 00:36:49,396
I wanted to say good-bye to both of you.

730
00:36:49,398 --> 00:36:51,932
- Here?
- Yeah.

731
00:36:51,934 --> 00:36:54,900
I just wanted us to be
all together one last time.

732
00:36:54,903 --> 00:36:57,069
What do you mean, one last time?

733
00:36:57,072 --> 00:36:58,988
Just because you're a fugitive,

734
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:01,417
it doesn't mean we
can't still communicate.

735
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,744
Well, things are gonna
be different this time.

736
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,617
You two don't need
my protection anymore.

737
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,019
You're our mom.

738
00:37:09,022 --> 00:37:12,519
We still want you in our lives.

739
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:14,737
I promised your father

740
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:18,339
that I would protect both of
you until you didn't need me.

741
00:37:18,342 --> 00:37:20,594
He would be so proud...

742
00:37:20,596 --> 00:37:22,831
So proud of you two.

743
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:24,464
I miss him so much.

744
00:37:24,466 --> 00:37:25,799
I know.

745
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:28,902
I wish I got to know him.

746
00:37:28,904 --> 00:37:31,271
I know, but he lives
on in the two of you.

747
00:37:33,008 --> 00:37:35,877
It's time for me to go
on a journey of my own.

748
00:37:38,247 --> 00:37:43,551
I love you both so much.

749
00:37:45,187 --> 00:37:47,454
So you promise me...

750
00:37:47,456 --> 00:37:50,925
That the two of you are gonna
take care of each other, okay?

751
00:37:53,123 --> 00:37:54,423
Okay?

752
00:38:18,453 --> 00:38:20,353
Hey.

753
00:38:28,826 --> 00:38:32,342
This is why we can't have a normal life.

754
00:38:32,345 --> 00:38:34,800
This is why our children

755
00:38:34,803 --> 00:38:37,542
will never have normal lives.

756
00:38:37,545 --> 00:38:39,539
I had to make the deal.

757
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:41,775
Oh, there's always gonna be some danger

758
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,810
or some threat...

759
00:38:43,812 --> 00:38:48,608
The league of assassins
or hive or the Ninth Circle

760
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:49,845
or...

761
00:38:51,887 --> 00:38:54,688
The end of the friggin' universe.

762
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,325
I need you to make me a promise.

763
00:38:58,327 --> 00:39:00,026
Yeah, okay.

764
00:39:00,028 --> 00:39:02,569
No matter what happens to me...

765
00:39:02,572 --> 00:39:05,965
No matter what...

766
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:09,469
You need to do everything
in your power...

767
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:11,805
You...

768
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,895
You need to keep William and Mia safe.

769
00:39:13,898 --> 00:39:15,831
I will keep them safe.

770
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:18,079
But wherever you go...

771
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,918
Whatever happens to you...

772
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:30,123
You'll never leave me.

773
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:33,847
On our wedding day, you told me
that I was the best part of you,

774
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,529
but the truth is...

775
00:39:36,532 --> 00:39:39,222
We are the best parts of each other.

776
00:39:39,225 --> 00:39:45,705
And that is so much bigger
than the friggin' universe.

777
00:39:45,707 --> 00:39:47,540
When I came back to Star City

778
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:49,209
to start my mission,

779
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:58,052
I didn't think that I was
capable or deserving of love.

780
00:39:59,588 --> 00:40:01,755
But you opened up my heart

781
00:40:01,757 --> 00:40:06,393
in ways that I never th...
thought were possible.

782
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,365
My only regret is not telling
you I loved you sooner.

783
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:14,800
No regrets.

784
00:40:16,271 --> 00:40:19,305
Would you tell Mia that
I love her every day?

785
00:40:19,307 --> 00:40:22,075
And I know that she will grow up to be

786
00:40:22,077 --> 00:40:24,495
as smart and as beautiful

787
00:40:24,498 --> 00:40:25,933
as her mom.

788
00:40:25,936 --> 00:40:29,282
I will find you... again.

789
00:40:29,284 --> 00:40:31,251
I promise.

790
00:40:31,253 --> 00:40:32,652
I love you.

791
00:40:32,655 --> 00:40:35,163
I love you so much.

792
00:41:11,064 --> 00:41:12,490
I'm ready.

793
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:21,101
Where I'm taking you,
there is no return.

794
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:24,304
I have waited a very
long time to see him.

795
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:26,201
I'm ready.

796
00:41:42,837 --> 00:41:46,944
