-But... Where are you going?
-[Merimac] Uh, nowhere.

163
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,541
Take us with ya.

164
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,000
Uh, sorry, no outsiders in the village.

165
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,666
Village? What village?

166
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,750
No village! There's no village.

167
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,375
Listen here, Nobody.

-[exclaims]
-Either we're coming with you

169
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,541
or I will turn you in myself
this moment, water-thief.

170
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,791
[Merimac] You're about to meet The Gund,
our dwell-leader.

171
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:30,833
And if you want her to even think
about takin' you in, there's four rules.

172
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,541
One, never look her in the eye.

173
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,375
B, always stand three steps back.

174
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:41,250
Four, don't, ever, ever, no matter what,
call her "The Gund."

175
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,958
-Got it.
-Got it.

176
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,125
Was that three rules or four?

177
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,708
[Poppy] I wasn't really paying attention.

Off you go, have fun now.

Come on. Over there.

182
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,500
[female Stoor villager 2]
That's 'cause it's had the sunshine on it.

183
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,791
[female Stoor villager 3] You're there.

187
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,625
It doesn't seem natural.

188
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,041
[Gundabale]
That's 'cause we're not Harfoots.

189
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,333
We're Stoors.

190

[Gundabale] What were you thinkin',
bringin' 'em here?

-Nobody's that stupid.
-[scoffs]

193
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,708
They needed a place to hide.

What, with half the devils
in the desert searchin' for them?

195
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:14,250
Boy, if we put your brains in a vulture,
it'd fly backwards.

Be nicer to him.

197

Are you talkin' back-sass to me?

198
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,625
Oh, that was the fourth rule.

199
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:26,250
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't
feed you leg, limb, and joint

to those Gaudrim hunting you out there.

201

Go on, plead your case.

202
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:42,083
I have walked across rivers,
and mountains,

203
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,416
and deserts to help my friend
find his destiny,

depend on, yours included...

-He's a giant.
-A giant?

208

-What, like an Elf?
-Bigger than that.

209
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,250
So he's a great big Grand-Elf.

210
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,208
He's not an Elf.

211
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,125
He's a wizard.

Well, the only wizard under these skies

215
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,666
is the Dark Wizard.

216
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,666
And the last friend we need
is a friend of his.

217
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,041
Tie 'em up.

218
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,875
[Poppy] What?
What? No.

219
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,875
What? Let her go. What Dark Wizard?

220
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:31,875
[Brânk] The <i>Istar</i> is already much more
powerful than we had anticipated.

221
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,291
He conjured a sandstorm from thin air
that killed two of my men,

222
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,125
He makes his way north now.

223
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,583
Towards... the hermit.

224
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,416
[Dark Wizard] And what of the halflings?

225
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,541
[Brânk] We are scouring the desert
even now.

226
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,291
They will not evade us for long.

227
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,625
I swear my life on it.

228
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,625
You are either very foolish, Gaudrim,

229
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,083
or very brave.

230

Let the Harfoots be your sole concern.

before the river and the trees.

and the first acorn.

He knew the dark under the stars
when it was fearless.

This whole place used to be green.
Now, it's all sand.

You wield power over trees,
over wind and fire.

You wield it, as if it belongs to you.

All things belong each to themselves.

Just as you belong to yourself.

how to wield a staff?

well, we shall soon discover.

00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,500
The Dark Wizard.

321
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,125
What became of him?

322
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,333
Once, he sought to control magic,
like you.

323
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,791
Now, he controls much of Rhûn.

324
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,458
But still, he hungers for more.

325
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:48,416
You believe his evil will spread?

326
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:53,666
Not without an ally
far more powerful even than himself.

327
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,666
Sauron.

328
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,750
If these two flames combine into one,

329
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,166
there will be no end to burnin',
till all Middle-earth is ashes.

330

Can you stop it?

331
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,583
Old Tom's a wanderer, not a warrior.

332
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:23,750
Great deeds are left
to the hands they were placed in.

333
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,166
And I shall gather lilies,
while yet they grow.

334
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:34,583
You mean...

335
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:38,750
You mean my hands.

336
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:51,291
Is it my task to stop the fire?

337
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:55,125
Is it my task to face Sauron?

338
00:24:57,916 --> 00:25:02,625
Your task... is to face them both.

Known to Men as the Barrow-downs.

344
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:58,916
In ancient days, this was where
they laid their lords and kings to rest.

345
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,625
I feel no rest here.

The King sent a dispatch

She's one of them.

Truth is, he was in your place...

He was called Sadoc Burrows.

Sadoc Burrows was your leader's name?

Sure of what?

555
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:05,708
Story goes, in ancient days,
there was a Stoor.

556
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:07,791
Wasn't like the rest of us.

557
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:13,833
They say he dreamed one night of a place,
with endless streams of cold water

558
00:41:13,916 --> 00:41:18,500
and rollin' hills so soft,
a family could dig a hole

559
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:20,625
and live in it in less than a month.

560
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:24,708
He called it "the Sûzat."

561
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:29,708
Struck out one year
with a caravan of followers to find it.

562
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:31,333
Promised, when he did,

563
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:34,041
he'd send someone back
to gather the rest of us.

Have you come back here
to lead us all to the Sûzat?

Rorimas never found the Sûzat.

[Brânk] Do you know
why we wear these masks?

Defy the Dark Wizard
and, when we return with him,

you will find out for yourselves.

[Galadriel] I know you believe this Ring
is deceiving me.

But I believe it is guiding me,

587
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:43,750
and that following it
may be our only path to victory.

588
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,375
Is there no point at which
the cost of victory becomes too great?

I have yet to reach that point.

How does that not terrify you?

591
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:59,875
Because the suffering
of a world ruled by Sauron

592
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:01,666
terrifies me more.

593

I have always felt it.
But with this Ring, I can see it.

597

I will choose the path I must to give me
the best hope of protecting it.

598

Protecting that which is most fragile,

most dear,
is a task entrusted to all Elves.

00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,083
Maiming and murdering as they marched.

647
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:21,583
We saw what they did.

648
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:26,208
Is that why you're here?
Why you're so angry?

649
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:34,291
The spilling sap and burning branch
called to us from afar.

650
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:39,583
But... we were too late.

651
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:42,666
An army? How long ago was this?

652
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:46,875
Winterbloom nourished many of those trees
from seed and sprout.

-Do not ask her to speak more of it.

[Winterbloom]
They are no different from them!

655
00:50:56,333 --> 00:51:01,125
Disemboweling, and uprooting,
branch-breakers and trunk-splitters, all!

656
00:51:07,416 --> 00:51:08,333
[in Sindarin] We would seek...

657
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,041
[groans softly]

658
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,333
your forgiveness...

659
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,333
for the injury...

660
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,708
...we have done.

661
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:53,583
[in English] Forgiveness takes an age.

662
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:06,291
Rain washing clear
the long memory of soil.

663
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:10,875
New bark, covering old scars.

664
00:52:11,666 --> 00:52:15,458
And in all that time, I promise,

665
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:19,916
we will see to it that the trees
of this wood are left in peace.

666
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:40,083
Think they know what peace is?

667
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:44,000
It is what comes after the night storms,

668
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:47,958
when the dawn is silent,
and the birds awaken.

669
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:53,208
We have tended this forest

670
00:52:53,291 --> 00:52:57,291
since before the mountains
rose up and divided it.

671
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:06,625
<i>When the only sound here
was the light upon the moss...</i>

672

Theo?

673
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:15,833
<i>And the breathing of the leaves.</i>

674
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:24,500
<i>Yes. We know peace.</i>

675
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:27,291

00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,791
-What... I thought you...
-So did I.

680
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:53,875
[Estrid] I can't believe you're here.
Look at you.

681
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,416
[footsteps thudding]

682
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:22,250
Thank you for coming for me.

683
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:28,166
I made a promise.

684

Thank you for keepin' it.

685
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:37,291
Now I must keep another.

686
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:43,541
Orcs are on the move.
I must follow the trail where it leads.

687
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:47,083
Perhaps have another chance
to confront Adar.

688
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:52,625
You can come with me, if you wish.

689
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:58,666
I have promises of my own to keep.

690
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:10,250
Then <i>mae glenno.</i> Lord of Pelargir.

Orc-treachery.

695

That trail.

696
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:54,041
I gather it leads to...

697
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:56,166
Eregion, my liege.

698
00:55:57,041 --> 00:56:01,333
We came in search of Sauron.
And instead, we find Adar?

699
00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:03,791
Could they
be in league with each other or...

700
00:56:05,708 --> 00:56:06,916
Perhaps at war.

701
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,375
A legion of Orcs
have marched into Elvish lands.

702
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:12,083
We are all of us at war.

703
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:18,541
Word of this must reach the High King
before our host sails for Mordor.

704
00:56:22,875 --> 00:56:23,916

[Borzag] Came from over here.

[Borzag, in English]
Leave no stone unturned. Go!

00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:43,583
Get to Lindon.
I will occupy them as long as I am able.

[Borzag] Keep looking.

Take it.

No, you are mistaken, Camnir.
