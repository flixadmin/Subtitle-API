1
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,449
Najid, cut
the horses loose!

2
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,050
We have to turn back.

3
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,288
We have been riding
for six months.

4
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,283
And we've lost 20 men.

5
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,726
But we survived.

6
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,683
Yes. By chance.

7
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,122
Any one of us could
have met that same fate.

8
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,282
We were the strongest.

9
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,284
Remember why you're here.

10
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,206
In the West, we would be enemies,
and I would have to kill you.

11
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,125
At least here,
we have a common goal.

12
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,406
Oh, yes.

13
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,084
This black powder.

14
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,603
It turns air into fire.

15
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,361
And kills a dozen men
at one time.

16
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,363
It is the weapon
of our dreams.

17
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,970
And what if
it's just a myth?

18
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,961
Men have sent word
that it's real.

19
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,241
And those men are dead.

20
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,725
And we are next.

21
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,685
We have no maps,

22
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,131
no medicine

23
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,406
and no food.

24
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,166
No one is going back.

25
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,203
We take inventory
of what we have left

26
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,488
and finish
what we started.

27
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,642
There's not much here.

28
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,685
The moon is strong.

29
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,848
When the horses
are fresh, we move.

30
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,809
- To where?
- North.

31
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,409
If they keep after us, we'll
kill them in the mountains.

32
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,931
The magnet.

33
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,730
Too heavy.

34
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,966
Useless.
I'll have it.

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,126
It's all yours.

36
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,971
Amigo, only you would carry a
stupid magnet through the desert.

37
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,644
I can use it
to make a compass.

38
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,522
Rizzetti won't make it.

39
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,521
The wound is festering.

40
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,125
We'll be dragging
a corpse.

41
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,282
I heard that.

42
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,361
He's earned the right
to die where he wants.

43
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,930
I've been left
for dead twice.

44
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,170
It was bad luck.
For who?

45
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,969
The people who left me.

46
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,965
Maybe Rizzetti's right.

47
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,131
Where are they?

48
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,886
Hill tribes?

49
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,891
It's no man.

50
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,885
Then what is it?

51
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,722
Whatever it is,
it's hunting.

52
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,450
What was that?
I don't know.

53
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,611
I took its hand.

54
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,121
- We need to move.
- Agreed.

55
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,480
I'll take the hand with us.

56
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,840
What the hell for?

57
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,161
So someone can tell me
what I just killed.

58
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,961
Persistent bastards,
aren't they?

59
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,650
We'll take the rise,
make a stand there.

60
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,489
What a long shitting
way to go to die.

61
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,165
Mother of God.

62
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,804
I have no need
to go down fighting.

63
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,405
Agreed.

64
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,410
I say we take our chances with
the gents in front of us.

65
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,086
I haven't surrendered
in a while, eh?

66
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,123
It'll come back
to you.

67
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,726
Follow my lead,
we'll be fine.

68
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,885
Of course,
my friend.

69
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,724
Where you go,
I follow.

70
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,723
You're doing such
a great job already.

71
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,129
They know what it is.

72
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,645
And they don't
look happy to see it.

73
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,487
All the more reason to get
the hell out of here.

74
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,523
Our weapons
are on that table.

75
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,129
Have you lost
your mind?

76
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,641
I can take out the guards on
the perimeter with my bow.

77
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,450
You cut the legs out
from under the officers.

78
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,171
I must confess, this is
not my favorite plan.

79
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,561
Where was this found?

80
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,810
You speak English.

81
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,486
Fantastic.

82
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,484
Where was this found?

83
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,009
It wasn't found.

84
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,846
It was taken.

85
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,207
That thing killed three men
before we took it down.

86
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,401
Where?

87
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,850
Two days' ride.

88
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,571
North, in the mountains.

89
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,567
Two of you,
you did this?

90
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,563
Well...

91
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,926
I killed it.

92
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,405
Alone?

93
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,324
Tell me how.

94
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,730
A swing of the sword.

95
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,888
The hand,
it came away clean.

96
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,921
The beast fell back
into a chasm.

97
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,090
Why are you here?

98
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,929
We came to trade.

99
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,008
We were ambushed.

100
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,246
You are soldiers.

101
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,041
Mmm.

102
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,609
Are you killing us, sister?

103
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,842
Two lost travelers?

104
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,125
I think she'd like that.

105
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,447
If it is death, my dear,
we need time to pray.

106
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,201
I'm trying here.

107
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,810
Sister, I know a siege
when I see one.

108
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,960
What comes at you so hard
you need a wall like this?

109
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,884
What the hell
did we kill out there?

110
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,525
Tao Tei.

111
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,521
You killed
a Tao Tei scout.

112
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,011
You killed it alone.

113
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,806
You're correct.

114
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,331
We are under siege.

115
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,691
But we did not expect the
attack for another nine days.

116
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,042
Attack?
Tao Tei.

117
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,409
What the hell
is a Tao Tei?

118
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,807
Many things about your
story have importance.

119
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,771
You are not to die today.

120
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,841
The black are
the foot soldiers.

121
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,121
And the red?

122
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,406
Those are the archers.

123
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,884
And the blue?

124
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,491
They're all women.

125
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,801
What the hell
do they do?

126
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,044
Look at this army.

127
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,884
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

128
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,610
Incredible.

129
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,369
They look nervous.

130
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,250
It's a big wall
to be so nervous.

131
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,164
Do you hear it?

132
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,401
William, over there.

133
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,923
Why isn't he tied up?

134
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,880
There's our escape.

135
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,971
We need to move!

136
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,690
We need to move
or we die!

137
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,681
Go, go!

138
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,526
Go and fight!

139
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,763
Cut me loose!

140
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,561
Fight or run?

141
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,641
Run where?

142
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,247
Aim for the eyes!

143
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,641
William!

144
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,089
Hey! Bitch!

145
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,331
William.

146
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,805
I need a shot.

147
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,687
What god made
those things?

148
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,523
None that we know.

149
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,204
Think they'll
hang us now?

150
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,448
I could use the rest.

151
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,769
You've earned
General Shao's praise.

152
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,405
Will they come back?

153
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,561
Yes.

154
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,771
All we can do
is prepare.

155
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,930
Who are you?

156
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,045
Easy.

157
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,928
I'm Ballard. Hmm?

158
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,241
William.

159
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,491
This is Tovar.

160
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,403
What are
you doing here?

161
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,528
We came looking
for black powder.

162
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,881
I bet you did.

163
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,725
I came with mercenaries
for the same thing.

164
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,450
Twenty-five years ago.

165
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,406
And did you find it?

166
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,689
Finding it and leaving with it
alive are two different things.

167
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,687
You saved the west turret.
That was extremely diplomatic.

168
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,728
We weren't
being diplomatic.

169
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,529
We were trying
to stay alive.

170
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,766
You smell like animals.
Thank you.

171
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,651
Clean up

172
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,329
and they'll feed you.

173
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,522
He knows where the powder is.

174
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,804
Then why is he
still here?

175
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,090
He needs help
getting out?

176
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,721
Right.

177
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,449
We play our part,

178
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,530
take the powder
and go home.

179
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,410
I didn't sign up for this.

180
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,567
Which part?

181
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,491
Well, all of it.
But mostly the monsters.

182
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,766
There's a lot of them.

183
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,208
We really do smell.

184
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,404
General Shao welcomes
you as honored guests

185
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,684
of the Nameless Order and thanks
you for your skill and courage.

186
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,363
We are honored
to be honored.

187
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,165
Is that the best
you've got?

188
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,004
Commander Chen thinks your bow

189
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,889
is not worthy
of your skill.

190
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,847
Tell him there's no
better weapon here.

191
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,564
They wish
to see you shoot.

192
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,081
In here?

193
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,321
What was that?

194
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,680
He thinks you have fear.

195
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,524
Too many people.

196
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,086
Get one of the cups.

197
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,526
Now?
Get one of the cups.

198
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,601
I want to eat.

199
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,641
You remember
how to do this?

200
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,001
Last time didn't go so good.
We were drunk.

201
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,761
How high?

202
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,770
Ten yards.
Six hands to the right.

203
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,041
Turn around.

204
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,440
No, I'll do it this way.

205
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,485
On my count.
Amigo...

206
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,165
One.

207
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,281
Two.

208
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,646
Three.

209
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,730
Pull.

210
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,684
Good luck with that.

211
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,490
I want food.

212
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,050
Who taught
you English?

213
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,687
Sir Ballard.

214
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,124
English and Latin.

215
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,321
Heard he's been here
for 25 years.

216
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,488
You won't
let him leave.

217
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,330
He must stay here.

218
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,126
What about us?

219
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,765
Pace yourself.

220
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,330
The meals
are regular here.

221
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,843
I hope not
to stay that long.

222
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,405
I like your thinking,

223
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,330
but I suggest you keep
your plans private.

224
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,323
You aren't
the first Westerners

225
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,323
to come here looking
for black powder.

226
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,647
We'll discuss it tonight.
Bring your partner.

227
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,245
How long
have you been here?

228
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,407
Always.

229
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,649
I was not five years old
when I came here.

230
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,882
I have no other family.

231
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,724
We're the same.

232
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,770
I was given to an army
before I can remember.

233
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,126
As a soldier?

234
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,044
Worse.
As a gleaner.

235
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,010
Packs of children, we'd
clean the battlefields.

236
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,208
After, when the
fighting's over.

237
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,568
I became a page,
a pikeman's boy...

238
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,603
For your country?

239
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,405
No. I fought for food.

240
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,964
You fight to eat.

241
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,523
You live long enough,
you fight for money.

242
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,841
How many flags
do you fight for?

243
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,884
I don't know.

244
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,280
I fought for Harold
against the Danes.

245
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,768
I saved a Duke's life. I
fought for him until he died.

246
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,931
Fought for Spain
against the Franks.

247
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,924
Fought for the Franks
against Boulogne.

248
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,804
I fought for the Pope.

249
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,763
Many flags.

250
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,088
We are not the same.

251
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,769
Meet me on the Wall. I have
something to show you.

252
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,611
He should be
careful with her.

253
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,284
She's very powerful here.

254
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,846
Then it is a fair contest.

255
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,481
Come.

256
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,882
Hmm.
You wish to try?

257
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,845
She says men
have so much to teach us.

258
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,164
I don't think
that's what she said.

259
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,290
You know what I think?

260
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,366
I think you're afraid.

261
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,849
You said that
this morning.

262
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,081
And yet,

263
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,683
here I am.
Yes.

264
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,971
Here you are.

265
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,650
Will you jump?
Or not?

266
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,523
These men know
what they're doing?

267
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,727
Wrong question.

268
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,684
Whether or not
the cable is attached,

269
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,806
that is the question.

270
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,000
And the answer?

271
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,411
Xin ren.

272
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,162
Xin ren means trust.
To have faith.

273
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,766
Here, in this army,

274
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,091
we fight for more
than food or money.

275
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,602
We give our lives
to something more.

276
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,921
Xin ren is our flag.

277
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,283
Trust in each other.

278
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,407
In all ways,
at all times.

279
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,206
Well, that's all well and
good, but I'm not jumping.

280
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,602
I'm alive today
because I trust no one.

281
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,922
A man must learn to trust

282
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,487
before he can be trusted.

283
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,568
Then you were right.

284
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,089
We're not the same.

285
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,930
My God!

286
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,324
A taste, a glimpse.

287
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,247
A few pilfered grains from Strategist
Wang's supply of black powder.

288
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,804
He's mastered the transmutation
of these elements.

289
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,291
People speak
of a weapon.

290
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,169
There are many
weapons here.

291
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,606
Why have we
not seen them?

292
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,889
There are many
things you have not seen.

293
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,368
And many things you should
pray will not be needed

294
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,921
before the siege
is through.

295
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,011
The Tao Tei will return.

296
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,522
When the drums
call to battle,

297
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,121
the guards leave their posts and
take their positions on the Wall.

298
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,851
That is our moment.

299
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,210
We want to be
riding away

300
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,683
as the battle rages.

301
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,889
And the armory doors?
You have keys?

302
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,809
I have black powder.

303
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,848
Enough for
several doors.

304
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,851
He brings us in.
We get us out.

305
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,882
As you fought,
where was this stone?

306
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,368
In my bag.

307
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,249
Its unseen force
is powerful.

308
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,724
I believe this strange
stone could help us.

309
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,488
We try everything.

310
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,881
Where are the
Tao Tei now?

311
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,446
The mountains, regrouping.

312
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,688
Where do they
come from?

313
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,407
About 20 centuries ago,

314
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,323
there was an emperor whose greed brought
deep suffering to all of China.

315
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,683
<i>The heavens sent the meteor
that struck Gouwu Mountain,</i>

316
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,128
<i>turning it green
and releasing the Tao Tei.</i>

317
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,205
<i>From that day on, the Tao
Tei rise every 60 years</i>

318
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,125
<i>to scourge
the north of China.</i>

319
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,923
<i>They come to remind us of what
happens when greed is unchecked.</i>

320
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,607
<i>They eat anything,
alive or dead,</i>

321
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,888
<i>and take food
to their queen.</i>

322
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,249
<i>She depends on her
soldiers to feed her.</i>

323
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,128
<i>Only with the food they provide
is she able to multiply.</i>

324
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,491
<i>The capital, and its two million
people, is only 800 Ii away.</i>

325
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,324
<i>If the Tao Tei ever had
that much nourishment,</i>

326
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,768
no corner of the world
would be safe.

327
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,771
You can't hunt them?

328
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,166
Men try.

329
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,647
They disappear.

330
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,521
We never find
their bones.

331
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,170
This is envoy
Shen from the palace.

332
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,841
He has brought important records
to help with the coming battle.

333
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,401
A 900-year-old
battle report.

334
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,526
At the Hansha gates,

335
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,689
three beasts
mounted the Wall.

336
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,601
They killed many men
as they went forward.

337
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,367
Then, by the grace
of the ancient gods,

338
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,761
the beasts stopped...

339
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,923
...and sat peacefully
as we slaughtered them.

340
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,609
At the Hansha Gate,
was a magnet just like this one.

341
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,402
I believe that magnet was the
reason that two of you Westerners

342
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,562
killed the Tao Tei
so easily.

343
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,001
I believe the magnet
makes the Tao Tei deaf.

344
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,564
Without instruction,
they fall still.

345
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,046
How can we be sure?

346
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,881
Why not try it?

347
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,646
Capture a Tao Tei.

348
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,961
See if it works.

349
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,641
How?

350
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,762
No net is strong enough.

351
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,087
Hunt them.
Like a whale.

352
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,244
You know what that is.

353
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,367
Uh... A water beast.

354
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,163
Hundred times
the size of a Tao Tei.

355
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,325
A spear that grabs. Hook the bone.
Pull them up.

356
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,729
I've seen
it done in Spain.

357
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,688
What the hell
are you doing?

358
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,410
We need to be free
when the attack comes.

359
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,891
How many chances do you
think we will get?

360
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,287
Be injured. Be missing.
Be a coward.

361
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,964
Get out of this.

362
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,526
We did enough.

363
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,961
He'll be here.

364
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,202
When?
When it's over?

365
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,049
We start
and he will find us.

366
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,167
Start?

367
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,970
We're jumping
off a cliff here.

368
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,962
I have everything.
Powder, tools, maps.

369
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,168
It's all hidden and
arranged along the route.

370
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,560
Once we start,

371
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,211
there's no going back.

372
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,403
I'll find him.
Forget him.

373
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,245
He'd rather die trying to
impress the new general

374
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,042
than grab the key to every counting
room and brothel in the world.

375
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,768
Good God, man.
The time is now!

376
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,569
I can't go
without him.

377
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,091
More the spoils for us!

378
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,162
We need his bow!

379
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,087
No, no, no. Stop!

380
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,440
There's too much tension.

381
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,010
Chain will break.

382
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,650
That way. That way.

383
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,006
Let him run!

384
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,410
Stop! Stop!

385
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,887
We need longer for the
sleeping potion to work.

386
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,561
That way. That way.

387
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,084
We need to isolate it.
Separate it from the others.

388
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,803
The chain won't hold much longer!

389
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,207
William, wait.

390
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,129
These arrows will
scream as the Tao Tei run.

391
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,767
Aim for the sound.

392
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,445
I'm only saving
you so I can kill you myself.

393
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,245
Grab an ax,
we're fighting blind.

394
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,848
Not yet.
I know what to do!

395
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,201
The fire's not
holding them back.

396
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,405
Die well, brother.

397
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,641
What the hell
are you doing?

398
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,926
She's listening.

399
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,526
Did it work?

400
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,171
Yes. The beast
was captured.

401
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,204
My friend...

402
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,170
He was unharmed.

403
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,206
Why did you go
over the Wall?

404
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,884
<i>Did I say it right?</i>

405
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,200
Thank you.

406
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,484
Black powder.

407
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,202
It is a terrible weapon.

408
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,887
It would be better if
you had never seen it.

409
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,370
I know very little
of the outside world.

410
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,525
But it seems to me,

411
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,082
the greed of men is not that
different from the Tao Tei.

412
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,570
Is that true?

413
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,526
The strong take
what they want.

414
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,921
Forget what you have seen.

415
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,447
Hmm?

416
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,369
You're much
braver than they think.

417
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,644
You wounded?

418
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,044
I was looking for you.

419
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,121
To say thank you.

420
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,725
You feel good, huh?

421
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,167
Maybe you sing
a little song, eh?

422
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,930
I will join you.

423
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,250
We can sing together how you
saved the grateful chinos.

424
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,761
You saw what happened out there
and that's what you say?

425
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,006
I see black powder.

426
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,086
I see a man
forget his friends.

427
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,688
The black powder's
not going anywhere.

428
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,882
What goes nowhere is you.

429
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,967
You'll never get
what you want from this.

430
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,406
You think they see you
as some kind of hero?

431
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,603
A man of virtue?

432
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,522
Maybe you can fool them,

433
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,602
but I know what you are.

434
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,285
You know what you are.

435
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,645
A thief,

436
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,571
a liar,

437
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,285
and a killer.

438
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:35,365
And you can never undo
the things you have done,

439
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,086
and you will
never be anything.

440
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,444
Good to see you again,
amigo.

441
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,449
Nothing?
No.

442
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,760
How do you know
he won't betray us?

443
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,966
I don't.

444
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,809
They'll kill him. They'll
kill him no matter what.

445
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,848
The time they spend
killing him

446
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,162
is time they are
not chasing us.

447
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,369
Careful with that.
There's powder here.

448
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,050
Tovar.

449
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,131
Have a look.
See if it's gone out.

450
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,606
Is it safe?

451
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,285
Of course it is.

452
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,521
Shake it off, man.
To work.

453
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,207
I thought
you said it was safe?

454
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,690
We're in, aren't we?

455
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,931
You're here.

456
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,050
We've come
to our senses, eh?

457
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,960
Ballard has
planned well.

458
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,929
Getting out is easy.

459
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,321
There's a gate.
20 miles west.

460
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,363
We dodge
the hill tribes.

461
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,521
We can make it.

462
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,006
They need us here.

463
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,889
They need more than us.

464
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,205
These people are doomed.

465
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,367
Don't be a fool.

466
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,447
I've been a fool.

467
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,284
I'm done with it.

468
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,205
Brother, please.

469
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,362
We've been fighting
for nothing.

470
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,486
For greed.

471
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:51,249
Amigo,
after all the blood,

472
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,846
and cold, and pain,

473
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,327
with this black powder
in our saddle bags,

474
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,925
we win.

475
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,406
You come with me.

476
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,486
I can't do that now.

477
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:06,727
Stay and fight.

478
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,406
William...

479
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,001
Think he's dead?

480
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,162
It'd take a lot
more than that.

481
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,440
Come on.

482
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,007
Hyah.

483
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:38,204
I tried to stop them...
You dare to speak to me?

484
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,440
I didn't do this.

485
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,044
And you came here
to trade.

486
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,043
And you knew nothing
of black powder.

487
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,680
What a fool
you must think I am.

488
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,001
If I was with them,
why would I be here?

489
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,161
I tried to stop them.
I tried...

490
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,291
You lie.

491
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,002
Some part of you knows
that's not true.

492
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:08,007
If I were not the General,
I would kill you myself.

493
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,969
Which way,
left or right?

494
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:32,450
Go up and take a look
from the high ground.

495
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,005
Hyah!

496
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,401
No!

497
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,480
No! Bastard!

498
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,165
What happened?

499
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,361
What happened?

500
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,329
We have failed.

501
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,921
The Tao Tei
are in the Kingdom.

502
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,922
You are free to leave.
Take what you wish and go.

503
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,088
This was the
General's final order.

504
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,401
Where is she?

505
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,405
To do what?

506
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,606
To fight?

507
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,051
Is there a chance?

508
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,286
There's only one.

509
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,762
Kill the Queen.

510
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,047
Kill the Queen,
or we all die.

511
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:47,961
Leave.

512
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,602
Tell the world
what you have seen,

513
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:52,882
and tell them
what is coming.

514
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,530
I'll need my bow.

515
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,806
If I'm to join you,
I'll need my bow.

516
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,408
He wishes
to join us.

517
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:32,967
No.

518
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,041
No.

519
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:39,721
No.

520
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,601
No.

521
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,124
No, don't throw
that thing near fire!

522
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,771
Above you!

523
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,564
Behind you!

524
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,764
I set you free.

525
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,091
And here I am.

526
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,926
There's the Queen!

527
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,281
They will not attack
while the Queen is feeding.

528
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,323
We have a chance!

529
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,521
Hold on!

530
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,329
There is
an underground canal here.

531
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,363
Has it been breached?

532
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,930
The Tao Tei should
all be above ground.

533
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,846
And the one we captured?

534
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,361
<i>We load it up.</i>

535
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,811
<i>We feed it.</i>

536
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,848
<i>And it will return
to its Queen.</i>

537
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,007
Good.

538
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,561
You'll have one hell of
a scar, but you'll live.

539
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,404
We'll come back for him.

540
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,890
They've broken through!

541
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,011
Patience, William.

542
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,043
And it will go to the
Queen when it's done?

543
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,526
It should.

544
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,087
It Will.

545
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,081
Let it in.

546
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,451
I can get a shot
from above.

547
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,767
Go! I'll hold them back.

548
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,290
Wait. Not yet.

549
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:18,961
Hit.

550
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,127
Go higher.

551
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,645
I'll get
a better shot.

552
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:44,961
General!

553
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,326
It's up to you now!

554
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,850
We have one black
powder weapon left.

555
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:42,410
Give me the spear.

556
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,005
I've trained for
this my whole life.

557
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,206
I'll get you the shot.

558
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,606
I've got you.

559
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,602
So, how's life
without me?

560
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,291
A little slow.

561
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,170
You're a hero after all.

562
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:10,960
Well, it looks that way.

563
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,361
You seem pleased
with yourself.

564
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,886
And what are they giving you
for all of your troubles?

565
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,041
A bag of gold?

566
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:19,802
A victory parade
along the top of the Wall?

567
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,283
All the black powder
I can carry.

568
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,611
And a cavalry escort
to get me home safely.

569
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,051
Well, congratulations.

570
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,963
Thank you.

571
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:33,362
So what is this? You're
here to rub my nose in it?

572
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:34,971
Well, would you
blame me?

573
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:37,447
The last time I saw you,
you left me for dead.

574
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:39,483
And the time before that,
I saved your life.

575
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:40,891
True.

576
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,846
You know, the Emperor
gave me a choice.

577
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,127
I could take
the black powder,

578
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,601
or I could take you.

579
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,408
Please tell me
you chose the powder?

580
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:03,409
I don't even
know you anymore.

581
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,730
The horses are
saddled and waiting.

582
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,087
Best we ride
before nightfall.

583
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,284
I'll be inside.

584
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,249
Don't leave
without me.

585
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,121
I came to say goodbye.

586
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,728
I understand congratulations
are in order.

587
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:39,121
General of the
northwest territory.

588
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,964
That's quite
an honor.

589
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:45,608
Seems you've made
your choice.

590
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:46,801
Him?

591
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,850
Believe me, I'm already thinking about
trading him back for the powder.

592
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,968
I heard that.

593
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,769
Perhaps we were
both wrong.

594
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:04,005
We are more similar
than I thought.

595
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:11,369
Thank you, General.

596
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:39,368
Are you sure you don't
want to go back?

597
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,001
Of course I do.

598
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:44,680
I just don't trust you to
make it out of here alone.
