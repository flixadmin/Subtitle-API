1
00:00:01,971 --> 00:00:04,956
<i>- Previously on</i> Gotham...
- Uncle Frank. Maybe you want to tell me

2
00:00:04,958 --> 00:00:06,487
where the hell you've
been since I was a kid.

3
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:08,195
FRANK:<i> The Court is a secret society.</i>

4
00:00:08,229 --> 00:00:09,598
If it's so secret, how
do you know about them?

5
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:11,233
Your father and I were both members.

6
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:12,734
GORDON:<i> It was a drunk driver!</i>

7
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:14,335
<i>I watched him die.</i>

8
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:15,603
My brother was making trouble
and they killed him.

9
00:00:16,503 --> 00:00:18,205
One cannot deny love.

10
00:00:20,507 --> 00:00:22,577
I... don't... love you.

11
00:00:23,777 --> 00:00:25,779
Look who's alive.

12
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:26,914
I just remembered.

13
00:00:26,948 --> 00:00:28,350
There's someone I need to kill.

14
00:00:28,382 --> 00:00:31,218
- KATHRYN: <i>The clone is in place.</i>
- FRANK:<i> What about Bruce Wayne?</i>

15
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:33,487
KATHRYN:<i> He should be
waking up as we speak.</i>

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,890
FALCONE: I've always done whatever
the Court has asked of me.

17
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:37,926
What aren't you telling me?

18
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,760
This city is on the brink of chaos.

19
00:00:39,794 --> 00:00:43,397
Seems like judgment came to
Gotham earlier than expected.

20
00:00:44,532 --> 00:00:46,501
Members of the Ruling Council,

21
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:48,937
Gotham has fallen ill.

22
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,907
Violence and crime continue to spread

23
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,543
like an unstoppable disease.

24
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:57,913
Drastic action must be taken.

25
00:00:57,946 --> 00:01:02,384
To that end, a weapon is being built.

26
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,787
A weapon intended to
be unleashed on Gotham

27
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,659
so that the city may be
cleansed and rebuilt by us.

28
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:13,294
The Head of our Court asks that we reach

29
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:16,465
a unanimous vote to proceed.

30
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:49,564
KATHRYN: Judgment has been passed.

31
00:01:49,597 --> 00:01:53,335
Gotham must fall.

32
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:33,909
I want to speak with
whoever's in charge.

33
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:39,880
That would be me.

34
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:42,884
Is the Court of Owls
behind my abduction?

35
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,885
The Court is a tool. Nothing more.

36
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,521
You won't get away with this.

37
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:48,490
People will know I'm gone.

38
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:49,623
We've taken precautions

39
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:51,626
to ensure your absence

40
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:53,594
won't be noticed.

41
00:02:55,796 --> 00:02:57,632
My clone.

42
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:00,001
He's in Gotham pretending
to be me, isn't he?

43
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:03,638
Alfred will figure it out.

44
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,906
Perhaps.

45
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:06,640
But by that time,

46
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:09,778
I'm hoping we've accomplished our goal.

47
00:03:09,811 --> 00:03:10,979
Which is what?

48
00:03:13,681 --> 00:03:15,984
I need your help, Bruce.

49
00:03:17,085 --> 00:03:18,920
Eat.

50
00:03:18,952 --> 00:03:22,390
You're going to need your strength.

51
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:24,892
We'll begin soon.

52
00:03:28,695 --> 00:03:29,797
REPORTER: Aubrey James, the once and...

53
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:31,399
All right, come on people, come on.

54
00:03:31,432 --> 00:03:32,801
Let's get back to work.
Joe, shut that off.

55
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,535
Can you believe this nonsense?

56
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:37,105
After all that's said and
done, who's back in charge?

57
00:03:37,138 --> 00:03:39,807
Aubrey James. The
original crook himself.

58
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:41,409
How was the cabin?

59
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:42,642
What?

60
00:03:42,676 --> 00:03:45,946
You and your uncle. You must've
had a lot to catch up on.

61
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:47,681
Oh, yeah.

62
00:03:47,715 --> 00:03:48,849
Any word on Nygma?

63
00:03:48,883 --> 00:03:51,586
No. But after gassing the cadets

64
00:03:51,618 --> 00:03:53,455
and dangling me over an empty stairwell,

65
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:55,490
he just disappeared.

66
00:03:55,522 --> 00:03:57,758
No riddles, puzzles or
singing telegrams, yet.

67
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:01,596
Who's, uh, "Michael Ness"?

68
00:04:01,628 --> 00:04:03,965
The drunk driver who
hit and killed my father

69
00:04:03,997 --> 00:04:05,499
when I was nine.

70
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:07,569
Something my uncle said got me thinking.

71
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:09,503
- What do you got?
- Not much.

72
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:12,005
He was convicted of
vehicular manslaughter.

73
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,975
Got six years.

74
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:16,711
Then got his ticket punched in a
prison stabbing a few months in.

75
00:04:16,743 --> 00:04:17,611
Silver lining.

76
00:04:17,645 --> 00:04:18,979
Yeah.

77
00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:21,750
But I pulled his medical
file from Blackgate,

78
00:04:21,782 --> 00:04:24,118
found something that wasn't
in the original case file.

79
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:25,887
He had "chronic persistent hepatitis."

80
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,390
I was gonna ask Lee what
it was when she got in.

81
00:04:29,424 --> 00:04:30,859
Chronic persistent hepatitis
is a non-progressive form

82
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:33,128
of liver inflammation.

83
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:34,996
How do you know that?

84
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:37,599
You kidding? It's known
as the Irish Curse.

85
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:39,166
With chronic inflammation,

86
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,735
you cannot drink. Nothing, not a drop.

87
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:42,604
Not even beer.

88
00:04:42,637 --> 00:04:44,005
Well, this guy didn't get the memo.
His blood alcohol

89
00:04:44,037 --> 00:04:45,005
was off the charts the
night of the accident.

90
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,608
You're not hearing me.

91
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,510
If this guy had chronic
liver inflammation,

92
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:50,043
if he blew a 0.1

93
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:51,746
on a blood alcohol test,

94
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:54,616
he'd be dead before he
got behind the wheel.

95
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:57,786
If that's true, then someone
dummied the report.

96
00:04:57,818 --> 00:04:59,621
Can you do some digging?

97
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:01,022
Find out who this guy was?

98
00:05:01,054 --> 00:05:01,922
Sure, but... Hey.

99
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:03,859
Where you going?

100
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,635
Ta-da!

101
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:14,768
Pretty cool, huh?

102
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,037
I told you the whole estate

103
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,772
was abandoned... can you believe it?

104
00:05:17,804 --> 00:05:19,773
- As a matter of fact, I can.
- You know,

105
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:21,676
the fresh air will do you good.

106
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:23,778
It smells like rotting death in here.

107
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:27,549
- Oh. I think someone's hungry.
- What are you doing? Stop it!

108
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:29,918
I... told you I am fine!

109
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,085
I am a grown man, for crying out loud!

110
00:05:32,118 --> 00:05:33,821
And you're hungry.

111
00:05:35,222 --> 00:05:36,824
Ah...

112
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:39,793
What's with you and all the plants?

113
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:42,063
Oh, they're my friends.

114
00:05:42,095 --> 00:05:43,797
Your friends?

115
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,933
- Yeah.
- Wonderful.

116
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:48,202
You know, plants make better
friends than most people.

117
00:05:48,236 --> 00:05:50,138
And some of them helped save your life.

118
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:53,941
It's broth.

119
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:56,677
I even put in some white
willow for your fever.

120
00:05:58,111 --> 00:06:00,547
- What is wrong with you?
- For the millionth time,

121
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,717
I need to get back to Gotham!

122
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,085
What's the rush?!

123
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:06,221
I was betrayed<i> and</i> shot.

124
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:09,256
I should be plotting my
revenge, building an army,

125
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:11,092
not drinking pinecone juice

126
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,728
with the... crazy plant lady.

127
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,830
So build an army. No one's stopping you.

128
00:06:15,863 --> 00:06:18,700
And I could even help
if you weren't being

129
00:06:18,732 --> 00:06:19,967
such a jerk.

130
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:21,135
Jerk.

131
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:24,039
Fine.

132
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:27,976
I need you to deliver a message

133
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:29,710
to Gabe.

134
00:06:29,743 --> 00:06:31,845
Who's Gabe?

135
00:06:31,878 --> 00:06:33,847
He's a moron.

136
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,618
But... he is a loyal moron.

137
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,285
And every army starts

138
00:06:38,318 --> 00:06:41,556
with one single loyal soldier.

139
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:49,063
"Please."

140
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,599
Please?

141
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:54,002
Okay.

142
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:55,703
Fine.

143
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:18,159
Thank you for meeting me.

144
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:19,960
Why here?

145
00:07:21,061 --> 00:07:23,330
It's public, open,

146
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:26,301
easy to spot if anyone's watching us.

147
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:29,304
The driver who hit my father's
car that night wasn't drunk.

148
00:07:29,337 --> 00:07:31,171
I think he did it on purpose,

149
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:33,640
and someone made it
look like an accident.

150
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:36,077
Easy enough for the Court.

151
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:39,780
So let's say I believe you.

152
00:07:39,813 --> 00:07:42,784
What do you want from me?

153
00:07:42,816 --> 00:07:44,686
I have just learned something

154
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:47,654
I am still having trouble believing.

155
00:07:47,688 --> 00:07:51,659
A weapon is en route, headed for Gotham.

156
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:54,328
A weapon the Court intends
to use to destroy the city.

157
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:56,364
What are you talking about?

158
00:07:56,397 --> 00:07:57,932
You said the Court controls Gotham.

159
00:07:57,965 --> 00:07:59,666
Why would they want to destroy it?

160
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,669
This isn't the Court as a whole.

161
00:08:01,702 --> 00:08:04,672
It's limited to a number
of high-ranking members,

162
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:07,675
fanatics who believe the
city needs to be cleansed.

163
00:08:07,707 --> 00:08:09,710
And you really think
they're capable of this?

164
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:11,345
They've done it before.

165
00:08:11,378 --> 00:08:14,381
Twice in the city's history
they've laid waste to Gotham.

166
00:08:14,414 --> 00:08:16,818
It's no bluff.

167
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:19,087
So how do we stop it?

168
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,854
I have no idea.

169
00:08:20,888 --> 00:08:23,690
I don't even know what the weapon is.

170
00:08:23,724 --> 00:08:25,892
But that's exactly what
I'm going to find out.

171
00:08:25,926 --> 00:08:27,695
- I can help.
- No. The Court knows

172
00:08:27,727 --> 00:08:29,396
I reached out to you, but that's all.

173
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:31,098
We need to keep it that way,

174
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:33,301
in case I'm discovered.

175
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:37,339
Be careful, Uncle Frank.

176
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,136
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to intrude.

177
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:09,736
I saw you earlier.

178
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:13,173
Who was that man you were with?

179
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:15,742
My Uncle Frank.

180
00:09:15,776 --> 00:09:18,945
I thought you two were estranged.

181
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:20,748
We recently reconnected.

182
00:09:20,781 --> 00:09:23,818
Good for you.

183
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:28,422
I've
been coming here a lot.

184
00:09:28,455 --> 00:09:30,791
The other day I saw this...

185
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:33,294
little old man, must
have been in his 90s,

186
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:34,895
all dressed up,

187
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:37,031
standing in front of his wife's grave...

188
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:38,900
smiling.

189
00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:42,403
I couldn't understand what
there was to smile about.

190
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:48,142
And then it occurred to me.

191
00:09:50,076 --> 00:09:52,846
They shared a whole life together.

192
00:09:56,216 --> 00:09:58,385
I'm sorry.

193
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,324
How do you do that?

194
00:10:03,357 --> 00:10:05,793
How do you just... move on,

195
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:08,997
leaving so much
destruction in your wake?

196
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:16,271
I wish I could do that.

197
00:10:25,245 --> 00:10:26,947
- Yeah?
- BULLOCK: Hey.

198
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,849
That driver that hit and
killed your father that night

199
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:29,850
was a career scumbag.

200
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:31,085
What'd you find out?

201
00:10:31,118 --> 00:10:33,220
He did a stretch for grand theft auto,

202
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:34,821
among other things, and get this...

203
00:10:34,854 --> 00:10:36,356
the high-priced lawyer
who got him his plea

204
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:40,128
was paid for by none other
than Carmine Falcone.

205
00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:52,678
Okay, that's... easy. Okay.

206
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:54,305
Okay, that's enough.

207
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:57,538
Oh, Boss, I can't believe it.

208
00:10:57,571 --> 00:10:59,045
You know that everyone
thinks you're dead.

209
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:01,497
- Yes.
- And that Barbara's running things?

210
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:04,115
Gabe, this might go faster
if you just listen.

211
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,350
I need to build an army

212
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,056
to exact my revenge,

213
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,476
and to take back my throne.

214
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:10,761
Will you help me?

215
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:12,021
Of course I will. When the guys hear

216
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,489
that you're still alive,
they'll come running.

217
00:11:14,514 --> 00:11:15,582
I'll make sure of it.

218
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:17,151
What do you want me to do?

219
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:19,119
That.

220
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:21,122
I want you to do that, Gabe.

221
00:11:21,154 --> 00:11:22,723
Right. I got it.

222
00:11:22,756 --> 00:11:24,058
No problem.

223
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,462
Hey...

224
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:30,631
Um... there's something<i> off</i> about him.

225
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:31,899
No argument there.

226
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't trust him.

227
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:34,903
Gabe?

228
00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:38,006
He's a human Labrador. You
whistle, he comes running.

229
00:11:38,038 --> 00:11:39,039
Trust me, he's loyal.

230
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:40,875
I have this perfume.

231
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:44,512
One whiff, and a man
will do anything I ask.

232
00:11:44,544 --> 00:11:45,913
Including telling the truth.

233
00:11:45,947 --> 00:11:47,916
Look, now that Gabe is here,

234
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:50,150
I'm afraid this is where we part ways.

235
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:51,785
I have an army to build,

236
00:11:51,818 --> 00:11:53,921
a war to plan,

237
00:11:53,955 --> 00:11:56,758
and we really do not know
each other that well.

238
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,026
You understand.

239
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:00,527
No.

240
00:12:00,561 --> 00:12:03,898
Maybe you can ask one of your plants.

241
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,067
I do not trust you.

242
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,534
I saved your life.

243
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:09,069
My men are on their way.

244
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:10,505
You trust him?

245
00:12:10,538 --> 00:12:11,906
But I...

246
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:13,808
I thought we were friends.

247
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:15,777
Friends?

248
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:17,178
Friends.

249
00:12:17,211 --> 00:12:19,681
Oh.

250
00:12:19,713 --> 00:12:21,548
You're being serious.

251
00:12:21,582 --> 00:12:23,952
Look, don't take this the wrong way,

252
00:12:23,985 --> 00:12:27,154
but you are a bit of a freak.

253
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,928
Did she tell you not to trust me?

254
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,864
Yeah.

255
00:12:37,697 --> 00:12:39,601
Why?

256
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:44,239
Smart girl.

257
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:56,944
Shall we begin?

258
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,793
The temple is some sort
of maze, is that it?

259
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:37,104
Everything is a maze, Bruce.
The only difference

260
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:40,293
is whether we realize
our place within it.

261
00:14:40,364 --> 00:14:42,463
Given enough time, I
will find a way out.

262
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,200
How much time?

263
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:47,771
How long have you been blindly
running down the corridors

264
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,341
of your life only to end
up in the same place?

265
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:53,944
It's time to pick a direction.

266
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,846
You can speak in cryptic
riddles all you want.

267
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,948
I'm not scared of you.

268
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,984
But you are scared of
something, aren't you?

269
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:06,056
Sit.

270
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:09,859
Let me show you what I have to offer.

271
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:19,068
You have some nerve showing up here.

272
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:20,803
We need to talk. Alone.

273
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,071
No, we don't.

274
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:23,473
You took my son from me.

275
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,208
And you took my father away from me.

276
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:28,211
I'd say that makes us even.

277
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:29,946
Your father was killed
by a drunk driver.

278
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:31,348
No, he wasn't.

279
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,349
The driver wasn't drunk.
He hit us on purpose.

280
00:15:33,383 --> 00:15:36,753
But I think you know that because
you paid for his lawyer.

281
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:41,157
Still think we have
nothing to talk about?

282
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,498
If you have a question for me, son...

283
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,534
why not go ahead and ask it?

284
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:53,135
Did you order the hit on my father?

285
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:54,370
No.

286
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:56,405
I respected your father.

287
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:59,409
Much more than the son he left behind.

288
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:00,876
But someone did.

289
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,045
It was a hit?

290
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,181
Yes.

291
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:09,385
The Court of Owls.

292
00:16:09,418 --> 00:16:12,254
What do you know about them?

293
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,858
I know my uncle is a member.

294
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,893
- Are you?
- No.

295
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:19,296
But we've built a
partnership which has been

296
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:21,531
mutually beneficial over the years.

297
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,166
You mean you do their bidding.

298
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,569
Everyone does the Court's bidding.

299
00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:27,903
Some of us just know it.

300
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:30,139
The person who came to you...

301
00:16:30,172 --> 00:16:32,075
a member of the Court?

302
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:34,444
Yes.

303
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:35,911
Who was it?

304
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:39,449
Who ordered the hit on my father?

305
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:41,384
I want a name.

306
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:47,057
Frank Gordon.

307
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,926
Your uncle.

308
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:05,909
Hello, Jim.

309
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,245
Thought we could use a drink.

310
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:15,059
Is it true?

311
00:17:15,093 --> 00:17:18,263
Did you order the hit on my father?

312
00:17:18,296 --> 00:17:21,200
Carmine called the Court after you left.

313
00:17:21,232 --> 00:17:22,815
You shouldn't have gone there.

314
00:17:22,846 --> 00:17:24,048
It'll raise suspicions.

315
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,617
Is it true?

316
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:30,955
Yes.

317
00:17:33,023 --> 00:17:34,258
Why?

318
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,894
I already told you...

319
00:17:35,926 --> 00:17:38,161
your father was determined
to expose the Court

320
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:39,731
and became a risk.

321
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:40,798
Simple as that.

322
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,132
So you had him killed?

323
00:17:42,165 --> 00:17:43,635
Your own brother?

324
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,269
You want to shoot me, Jim?

325
00:17:45,302 --> 00:17:46,737
You'd be doing me a favor.

326
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,272
But it won't change anything.

327
00:17:48,306 --> 00:17:50,107
The only thing we can do now

328
00:17:50,141 --> 00:17:53,077
is finish what Peter started
and bring down the Court.

329
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:54,279
It's what he would have wanted.

330
00:17:54,311 --> 00:17:55,812
What my father would have wanted

331
00:17:55,846 --> 00:17:57,848
is for justice to be done.

332
00:18:00,818 --> 00:18:03,020
So do I.

333
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:04,756
Frank Gordon, you're under arrest

334
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:06,891
for the murder of Peter Gordon.
Turn around.

335
00:18:06,923 --> 00:18:08,693
Turn around!

336
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:09,960
Have you not been listening?

337
00:18:09,993 --> 00:18:11,562
You have the right to remain silent.

338
00:18:11,596 --> 00:18:13,064
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

339
00:18:13,096 --> 00:18:14,898
- in a court of law.
- Arrest me

340
00:18:14,932 --> 00:18:16,668
- and it's over.
- You have the right to an attorney.

341
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:17,835
Stopping them is the
only thing that matters.

342
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:19,904
My father mattered!

343
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,179
Dock 9C.

344
00:18:28,212 --> 00:18:30,815
It's where the weapon will be arriving.

345
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:32,317
It's all I've been able to find out.

346
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:34,918
I need to speak with the
Court, try to buy some time.

347
00:18:34,952 --> 00:18:36,988
You need to find out when the
weapon will be arriving,

348
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,655
and you need to do it without the Court

349
00:18:38,689 --> 00:18:39,991
finding out you're involved.

350
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:43,927
Otherwise... we're both dead.

351
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:45,664
Make a choice, Jim.

352
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,844
I didn't think you had it in you.

353
00:18:59,876 --> 00:19:01,378
I know.

354
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:03,815
You never did.

355
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:05,817
Oh, boo-hoo.

356
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:07,952
Is that what this is about?

357
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:10,954
No one gave you a gold
star for thuggery?

358
00:19:10,988 --> 00:19:13,924
If you're gonna kill me,
then get on with it already.

359
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,696
I ain't gonna kill you.

360
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,933
We're gonna auction off that right

361
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:24,868
to the highest bidder.

362
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:28,373
We?

363
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:31,274
That would be my sales force.

364
00:19:52,062 --> 00:19:55,432
If he had just listened to me, but no.

365
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:57,401
Nobody listens to Ivy...

366
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:06,677
BULLOCK:<i> Whoa.</i>

367
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:08,011
That's a lot to take in.

368
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:09,747
Tell me about it.

369
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:12,683
A secret organization that
controls all of Gotham?

370
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:14,451
If that's true, somebody should tell 'em

371
00:20:14,484 --> 00:20:16,753
they're doing a pretty terrible job.

372
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:18,423
He told you all this at the cabin?

373
00:20:18,455 --> 00:20:21,291
Most of it. The weapon
intended to destroy the city...

374
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:23,760
that's a new wrinkle
he threw at me today.

375
00:20:23,794 --> 00:20:25,764
Quite the family reunion you're having.

376
00:20:27,464 --> 00:20:30,300
I didn't mean to involve
you in all this,

377
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:32,804
I just don't know who to trust anymore.

378
00:20:32,837 --> 00:20:34,172
Way I see it, as hard as it was

379
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:36,039
to hear what Falcone had to say,

380
00:20:36,073 --> 00:20:39,043
at least he confirmed the
existence of the Court.

381
00:20:39,076 --> 00:20:41,112
So I take my uncle at his word?

382
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:42,379
You work the lead.

383
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:43,981
Check the docks. But that's just me.

384
00:20:44,013 --> 00:20:46,383
I tend to give apocalyptic warnings

385
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,986
of mass destruction the
benefit of the doubt.

386
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:52,789
But it wasn't my father who was killed.

387
00:20:52,823 --> 00:20:55,993
So if you want to go after
your uncle for what he did,

388
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:58,096
I got your back.

389
00:20:59,864 --> 00:21:01,399
He says the Court has destroyed the city

390
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:03,201
twice before in its history.

391
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:05,102
We can't take that chance.

392
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:07,003
I'll call Judge Bam Bam, get a warrant.

393
00:21:07,037 --> 00:21:09,507
We'll hit the docks and start
kicking in doors today.

394
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:12,076
No. He was very clear.
The Court can't know

395
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:14,478
I'm looking into this. The
GCPD cannot be involved.

396
00:21:14,511 --> 00:21:16,947
So who do we know who can raid the docks

397
00:21:16,981 --> 00:21:18,482
who won't raise questions

398
00:21:18,516 --> 00:21:21,119
and isn't connected to the GCPD?

399
00:21:26,856 --> 00:21:28,992
No. No, no, no, no, no.

400
00:21:37,801 --> 00:21:38,969
Hmm.

401
00:21:39,002 --> 00:21:41,472
Feels a little light.

402
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:44,509
And, you know...

403
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,243
Mommy's gonna need

404
00:21:46,277 --> 00:21:48,513
a new pair of stilettos.

405
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,848
<i>Capisce?</i>

406
00:21:55,552 --> 00:21:56,987
Who's next?

407
00:22:00,023 --> 00:22:01,525
Barbara Queen.

408
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:05,863
Jim,

409
00:22:05,895 --> 00:22:07,999
what an unpleasant surprise.

410
00:22:08,031 --> 00:22:09,299
Let me guess,

411
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,870
do I hear a favor coming on?

412
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,479
I've been waiting a long time
for you to begin your journey.

413
00:22:21,511 --> 00:22:24,014
The only journey I'm going
to take is back home.

414
00:22:24,048 --> 00:22:25,482
Back to Gotham.

415
00:22:25,516 --> 00:22:29,420
Then we share the same destination.

416
00:22:31,254 --> 00:22:34,024
What are those?

417
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:36,461
Acupuncture needles?

418
00:22:38,229 --> 00:22:40,298
Of a sort.

419
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,333
Think of them as keys.

420
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:44,902
A way to open the mind to that

421
00:22:44,934 --> 00:22:47,437
which it locks away, even from itself.

422
00:22:52,108 --> 00:22:54,913
What are the symbols on the ends?

423
00:23:37,387 --> 00:23:40,191
You said you wanted to return to Gotham.

424
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:43,426
Here we are.

425
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,636
Oh, come on, Tom.

426
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:53,671
- It wasn't that bad.
- Oh, no?

427
00:23:53,703 --> 00:23:56,139
Childish drivel.

428
00:23:56,173 --> 00:23:58,308
MARTHA: I thought the acting was
fine, the music was lovely.

429
00:23:58,341 --> 00:24:00,577
What about you, Bruce?

430
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,646
Sorry, Mom, I agree with Dad.

431
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,015
It was kinda lame.

432
00:24:04,048 --> 00:24:05,650
THOMAS: "Kinda lame"?

433
00:24:05,683 --> 00:24:07,919
There's no such word as "kinda."

434
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:16,660
Dad?

435
00:24:16,662 --> 00:24:18,711
Mom?

436
00:24:18,743 --> 00:24:20,346
Give me your money!

437
00:24:30,688 --> 00:24:32,990
How'd you... how'd you do that?

438
00:24:33,023 --> 00:24:34,959
How did you do that?

439
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,276
What was that place?

440
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,312
- A memory.
- No.

441
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:42,013
No, it was real.

442
00:24:42,046 --> 00:24:43,248
The mind can do

443
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:45,885
far more than recall memories.

444
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:48,754
If one knows how, you
can experience them,

445
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:52,023
relive them as if they were
happening for the first time.

446
00:24:52,056 --> 00:24:54,993
You're saying we were inside my mind?

447
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,862
One is always inside their own mind.

448
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,032
Pretending we are separate from it,

449
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:02,601
that is the falsehood.

450
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:05,137
Why would you show me that?

451
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:08,273
Why would you take me back there?

452
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,875
You've never left that alley, Bruce.

453
00:25:10,908 --> 00:25:12,210
Not really.

454
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:15,214
And for you to be able
to accept what it is

455
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:17,984
I have to teach, you need to.

456
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,919
Rest.

457
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:23,056
We'll try again soon.

458
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,079
Torture is fun.

459
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:49,314
However, I need to know

460
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,651
what is coming into dock 9C.

461
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:54,654
I told you, there is no dock 9C.

462
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,688
- I can't tell you what I don't...
- What you don't know.

463
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,691
Yes, I've heard that one.

464
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,327
Now tell me something I haven't heard.

465
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,796
You don't know what they're capable of.

466
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,666
Even when Don Falcone
was running things,

467
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:10,135
he never asked questions
about what came into 9C.

468
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:12,705
In case you haven't heard,

469
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,941
Don Falcone ain't running things, baby.

470
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,211
Now, what is coming...

471
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,814
into dock 9C?

472
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,385
Something already came in last week,

473
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,387
- but they picked it up. Okay?
- Oh?

474
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:31,356
The crate, it's still over there.

475
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:34,225
I swear, that's all I know.

476
00:26:34,258 --> 00:26:35,694
I swear.

477
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:39,230
So, you must have a phone number

478
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,133
to alert them when things arrive.

479
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,869
Huh? What do you say

480
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:46,438
we give 'em a little call?

481
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:50,109
'Cause I would love an introduction.

482
00:27:21,372 --> 00:27:23,408
Get him!

483
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:44,830
I-I swear,

484
00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:46,865
I didn't tell her nothin'!

485
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:53,505
GABE: Make sure you get
him from all sides.

486
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:57,176
Potential bidders need to know
that he's alive and well.

487
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,177
Once we get these delivered,

488
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,312
the auction can begin.

489
00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:02,914
Forgot these in the car.

490
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,315
Cannolis from Alberto's, boss.

491
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,485
Thank God. I'm starved.

492
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:09,487
Alberto's are my favorite...

493
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,826
Looks like you got yourself
into quite the pickle.

494
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,327
You're sitting right next to me.

495
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,495
I think our fates are
somewhat intertwined.

496
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,398
Oh, no. I'll be fine.

497
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,000
What? What are you talking about?

498
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,835
Totally fine.

499
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,004
If you have a plan, tell me.

500
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,839
Tell me.

501
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,475
What? You want me to beg? Is that it?

502
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,409
I want you to be nice to me.

503
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,478
Nice to you?

504
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:34,013
Yes! Is that so much to ask?

505
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,346
No.

506
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:37,081
No, it's not.

507
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:39,317
Okay, I'll be nice. I promise.

508
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,353
Now, what is your plan?

509
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,354
Lay it on me.

510
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,357
Watch and learn.

511
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:48,259
Oh, yoo-hoo. Canolli guy.

512
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,062
Hey, quick question.

513
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,967
If I had information,

514
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:58,103
like, really good information

515
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:01,106
that would get you a ton
more money for Penguin,

516
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,074
would you let me go?

517
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:05,844
I don't know. Maybe.

518
00:29:05,878 --> 00:29:07,012
What is it?

519
00:29:07,044 --> 00:29:10,315
Oh, I can't tell you in front of...

520
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,885
Let me whisper it in your ear.

521
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,225
Do you like my perfume?

522
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,967
You'll do anything I ask?

523
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,403
Super.

524
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,370
Kill them all.

525
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,476
Wait!

526
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,445
Stop!

527
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:41,179
Get his gun.

528
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:42,414
Grab the gun!

529
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,918
Give it to me.

530
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,420
Give it to him!

531
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,889
And tell him to untie us.

532
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:50,956
Untie us!

533
00:29:50,988 --> 00:29:51,956
You don't have to yell.

534
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:53,157
Sorry.

535
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,126
I just got so caught up in the moment.

536
00:30:02,466 --> 00:30:04,436
You know,

537
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:07,438
I like the idea of an auction, Gabe.

538
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,075
I think I'll auction you off to myself.

539
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:13,913
Piece by bloody piece.

540
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,449
Carmine told us Jim came to him

541
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,620
asking questions about
his father's death.

542
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:23,621
What exactly does he know?

543
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,191
Only what Carmine knew.

544
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:29,028
That I gave the order
to have Peter killed.

545
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:33,064
Nothing can lead back to the Court.

546
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:34,600
After all these years,

547
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:37,635
why would he start
looking into this now?

548
00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:41,573
I don't know. Believe me, this
is the last thing I wanted.

549
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,344
Which is why I'm here.

550
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:47,279
I know my nephew.

551
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:50,616
Jim won't stop until one of us is dead.

552
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:53,017
Unfortunate.

553
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:56,621
He would have made a powerful
ally in what lies ahead.

554
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:58,389
In that case,

555
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,459
you know what you have to do.

556
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:05,063
James Gordon must be killed.

557
00:31:11,153 --> 00:31:13,456
- Barbara called.
- What'd she say?

558
00:31:13,488 --> 00:31:15,323
Apparently, dock 9C is being guarded

559
00:31:15,357 --> 00:31:18,060
by a blade-wielding psychopath
who almost killed them.

560
00:31:18,092 --> 00:31:20,329
Of course it is. Did she find
out if anything was coming in?

561
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:21,730
That's the thing,

562
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:24,065
it already has.

563
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:26,603
I thought your uncle said the weapon
wasn't in the city yet. He did.

564
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,471
Which means either he's
lying or he didn't know.

565
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:31,506
Either way, we have to assume
the Court already has it.

566
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,076
- We still don't even know what "it" is.
- We know one thing.

567
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:35,744
Barbara said the crate that she saw

568
00:31:35,778 --> 00:31:37,513
was stamped with Indian Hill.

569
00:31:37,545 --> 00:31:39,614
So something from the freak factory

570
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,349
is gonna wipe out the city?

571
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:51,359
Gordon.

572
00:31:51,393 --> 00:31:52,762
FRANK: We need to talk.

573
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:55,096
Did you know the weapon is here?

574
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:56,364
What? No.

575
00:31:56,397 --> 00:31:58,367
What the hell is going on, Frank?

576
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,368
We're running out of time.

577
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,535
I'm at my house.

578
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:02,271
Come alone and come quickly.

579
00:32:11,547 --> 00:32:13,382
I trusted you, Gabe.

580
00:32:13,415 --> 00:32:16,118
And how did you repay that loyalty?

581
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,786
Betrayal.

582
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,522
Not for nothing,

583
00:32:20,555 --> 00:32:22,657
but I was there after
your mother was killed

584
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,393
when no one else was.

585
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:26,262
And how'd you repay me?

586
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:28,397
By passing me over.

587
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:30,666
Wow.

588
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,268
A valid point.

589
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:35,670
Perhaps we forget that loyalty

590
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:39,541
must be extended before
it can be returned.

591
00:32:39,574 --> 00:32:41,543
Yeah.

592
00:32:41,577 --> 00:32:44,413
You were loyal to me once, Gabe.

593
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:46,415
I wonder, could you be again?

594
00:32:46,447 --> 00:32:48,551
Yes! Oh, boss.

595
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:52,554
I'd swear an oath on my dead
mother's grave right now.

596
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:54,156
God rest her soul.

597
00:32:54,188 --> 00:32:56,291
No need for anything so dramatic.

598
00:32:56,324 --> 00:32:59,160
Ivy, would you mind ensuring

599
00:32:59,194 --> 00:33:03,099
that Gabe's oath of loyalty
is noble and true?

600
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:08,303
If what is what now?

601
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:10,306
Make him smell your perfume.

602
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:12,508
Right. Okay.

603
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:19,849
Um, raise your right hand.

604
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:22,450
Do you swear

605
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:25,487
to be loyal and true to Penguin?

606
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,224
No.

607
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,326
Ouch.

608
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:34,397
I don't understand. Why not?
Why can't he be loyal?

609
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,365
Go ahead, answer.

610
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:39,868
I never was.

611
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:42,203
I only followed you out of fear.

612
00:33:42,236 --> 00:33:44,205
We all did.

613
00:33:44,238 --> 00:33:46,741
Actually, I can live with that.

614
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:50,478
Fear and respect... management 101.

615
00:33:50,512 --> 00:33:52,214
No one ever respected you.

616
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:56,252
We always saw you for
what you really are.

617
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,754
A tiny freak who used
to hold an umbrella.

618
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,457
Nothing more.

619
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,194
A freak?

620
00:34:06,427 --> 00:34:08,397
A... freak?

621
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,683
A<i> freak?!</i>

622
00:34:16,626 --> 00:34:17,727
No!

623
00:34:17,752 --> 00:34:18,253
A freak!

624
00:34:18,442 --> 00:34:20,777
A freak! A<i> freak!</i>

625
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:38,928
Thanks for coming.

626
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:41,397
The weapon the Court is planning

627
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:45,267
to use on Gotham came from Indian Hill.

628
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,669
Any idea what it might be?

629
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:49,571
No.

630
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:53,274
Like I said, I had no idea
that it had already arrived.

631
00:34:53,307 --> 00:34:55,878
It's clear that the Court
no longer trusts me.

632
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:01,484
Then why call me down here?

633
00:35:04,318 --> 00:35:06,922
I'm supposed to kill you.

634
00:35:08,457 --> 00:35:11,827
Which leaves us... where?

635
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,696
That's up to you.

636
00:35:14,729 --> 00:35:17,432
I need someone to replace
me on the Court.

637
00:35:17,466 --> 00:35:19,734
Someone who can find
out what the weapon is

638
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:21,970
and how to stop it.

639
00:35:22,004 --> 00:35:24,272
Someone I can trust.

640
00:35:26,608 --> 00:35:29,311
You need to join the Court of Owls, Jim.

641
00:35:29,343 --> 00:35:31,446
It's the only way.

642
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:33,881
You just said they want me dead.

643
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:35,883
They still want you on the Court.

644
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:38,354
They just don't seen
now how it's possible,

645
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,455
but I do.

646
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:43,458
At some point, a woman named

647
00:35:43,492 --> 00:35:45,327
Kathryn is going to call

648
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,762
to ask if you are dead.

649
00:35:47,796 --> 00:35:50,332
And when she does,

650
00:35:50,365 --> 00:35:52,767
I suggest you pick up.

651
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,003
And tell her what?

652
00:35:55,037 --> 00:35:56,638
That you blame me for
your father's death.

653
00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:58,506
I gave the order to have him killed,

654
00:35:58,539 --> 00:35:59,874
and I deserved what I got.

655
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,610
What are you talking about?

656
00:36:01,642 --> 00:36:02,878
You have his strength, Jim.

657
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,347
You can finish what he started.

658
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:08,884
For both of us.

659
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:12,021
He would have been so proud of you.

660
00:36:12,053 --> 00:36:14,823
No!

661
00:36:38,502 --> 00:36:41,038
Please! Please. I'm sorry.

662
00:36:41,063 --> 00:36:42,332
I'll do whatever you want.

663
00:36:42,357 --> 00:36:44,361
Just please don't make me go back there!

664
00:36:51,785 --> 00:36:52,987
Give me your money!

665
00:37:12,735 --> 00:37:15,138
No!

666
00:37:59,184 --> 00:38:03,789
I have so much to teach you, Bruce.

667
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,892
But your pain...

668
00:38:05,925 --> 00:38:09,062
it blocks you from who
I need you to become.

669
00:38:09,095 --> 00:38:13,133
Who Gotham needs you to become.

670
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:34,675
If one's feelings and
emotions are strong enough,

671
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:39,973
their consequences can follow
you back into the real world.

672
00:38:40,126 --> 00:38:43,863
I don't know what you want from me.

673
00:38:46,009 --> 00:38:48,746
Over the centuries, we've
tried to end the cycle

674
00:38:48,771 --> 00:38:51,841
of crime and violence
that plagues Gotham,

675
00:38:51,866 --> 00:38:54,969
only for it to start up again.

676
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,300
And do you know why it does?

677
00:38:59,812 --> 00:39:02,916
People are afraid.

678
00:39:04,043 --> 00:39:07,780
And fear breeds hopelessness.

679
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:11,950
I'm supposed to believe you care
about the people of Gotham?

680
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,311
I do.

681
00:39:14,336 --> 00:39:16,805
Very much.

682
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,766
Which is where you come in.

683
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:22,327
Gotham needs something I believe

684
00:39:22,352 --> 00:39:25,690
only you can provide.

685
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:28,416
What?

686
00:39:29,289 --> 00:39:32,254
A protector, Bruce.

687
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:37,708
I can't protect Gotham.

688
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,849
Not by myself. No one can.

689
00:39:39,874 --> 00:39:41,709
Perhaps.

690
00:39:41,734 --> 00:39:44,603
But if you were to become a symbol,

691
00:39:44,814 --> 00:39:48,285
a symbol against fear,

692
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,684
then Gotham can be reborn.

693
00:39:59,373 --> 00:40:02,244
Okay, I admit it.

694
00:40:02,674 --> 00:40:05,510
I might have lost my
temper there a little bit.

695
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,717
Sorry about that.

696
00:40:08,683 --> 00:40:09,962
It's okay.

697
00:40:09,987 --> 00:40:13,224
I don't know why I let him get to me.

698
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,655
Sticks and stones, right?

699
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:16,573
Hmm.

700
00:40:17,044 --> 00:40:20,215
Words always hurt me way
more than sticks or stones.

701
00:40:21,236 --> 00:40:22,579
Yeah. Me, too.

702
00:40:24,665 --> 00:40:28,102
So does this mean you're giving
up your plans for revenge?

703
00:40:28,456 --> 00:40:32,093
I can't take on Nygma and Barbara

704
00:40:32,118 --> 00:40:33,852
and the rest of them by myself.

705
00:40:33,877 --> 00:40:36,846
Who said anything about
taking them on by yourself?

706
00:40:37,088 --> 00:40:39,190
Selina told me some pretty crazy stories

707
00:40:39,215 --> 00:40:40,961
about people she met
down in Indian Hill.

708
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,966
Said you wanted to build an army, right?

709
00:40:43,991 --> 00:40:45,827
Well,

710
00:40:45,852 --> 00:40:49,957
what about an army of freaks?

711
00:40:51,694 --> 00:40:54,764
What kind of freaks?

712
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:19,894
Kathryn, I presume.

713
00:41:19,919 --> 00:41:21,521
KATHRYN: Detective Gordon.

714
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:23,766
I can't say I'm entirely surprised.

715
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:25,127
I killed my uncle.

716
00:41:25,394 --> 00:41:27,097
I make no apologies for it.

717
00:41:27,122 --> 00:41:28,489
We understand.

718
00:41:28,537 --> 00:41:31,541
Good. Maybe it's time we meet.

719
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,062
Agreed.
