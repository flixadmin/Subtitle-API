1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,600
<i>Time travel is real,</i>

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,960
<i>and all of history
is vulnerable to attack,</i>

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,960
<i>which is why we must travel
through time</i>

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,120
<i>to stop the spread of these
so-called Time Aberrations</i>

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,640
<i>and to erase their damage to history.</i>

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,080
<i>We are a team
of outcasts and misfits.</i>

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,200
<i>So please don't call us heroes.</i>

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,720
<i>We're Legends.</i>

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,000
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,160
I think I can save him.

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,600
<i>It's a biomolecular enhancer.</i>

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,200
You got super powers now, dude.

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,160
Name's Steel.

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,200
I'm not going back until Rex's
killer is brought to justice.

15
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,960
You let the shogun steal
a 21st century super-suit?

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,480
I have to teach you to destroy

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,000
the only thing that makes me hero.

18
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,080
Do it!

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,920
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
<i>Dontar.</i>

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,360
Dontar, are you reading this?

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,880
They're dead! They're all dead.

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,320
The heist went off easy.

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,920
We got the TX-90 out of 2235

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,120
as contracted, but...

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,600
but Alec got infected.

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,680
And then he killed...

28
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,560
God, you wouldn't imagine
what he did to everyone.

29
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,760
I don't know when I am.

30
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,240
I'm activating the temporal beacon.

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,240
You get in the "Dauntless"

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,640
and you get out here
and rescue my ass.

33
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,320
Don't move.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Don't move.

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,560
{\an5}What the hell is this thing?

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,640
<i>I can't risk putting
any more lives in danger.</i>

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,600
<i>And neither can you.</i>

38
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,320
{\an5}<i>Which is why you'll keep
what I'm about to tell you</i>

39
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,800
<i>a secret.</i>

40
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,240
<i>Even from the rest of your team.</i>

41
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,040
<i>A war is coming, Captain Hunter.</i>

42
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,560
How many times are we gonna listen

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,000
to this message from Future Barry?

44
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,320
Until it make sense.

45
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,280
{\an5}So, forever
is basically what you're saying.

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,320
You haven't spoken
to anyone else about this?

47
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,440
No.

48
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,640
We agreed that we wouldn't.

49
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,360
And yet, I find myself asking.

50
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
<i>Martin?</i>

51
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,080
Oh. Sara.

52
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,880
What can I do for you?

53
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,480
<i>You never call me Sara.</i>

54
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,120
<i>Everything with you is Ms. Lance.</i>

55
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,960
I'm turning over a new leaf.

56
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,360
<i>Well, turn it over in the Library.</i>

57
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,440
<i>We've got something.</i>

58
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,840
<i>I don't know when I am.</i>

59
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,200
<i>I've activated the temporal beacon.</i>

60
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,160
<i>You get in the Dauntless</i>

61
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,560
<i>and you get out here
and rescue my ass.</i>

62
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,960
A bit vulgar for a Time Master.

63
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,760
Time Pirate, we're thinking.

64
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,040
He activated a beacon.

65
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,240
We have to go after him.

66
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
He's a Time Pirate.

67
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,440
Why would we rescue him?

68
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,880
Because if he ends up
somewhere he shouldn't...

69
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,200
And does something he shouldn't...

70
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,960
It's Aberration-palooza.

71
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,280
So, where do we think

72
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,200
he's going to end up?

73
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,880
Looks like Mississippi, 1863.

74
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,920
Height of the American Civil War.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,800
It's also the bloodiest year
in American history.

76
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,960
{\an5}We got to watch each
other's backs out there.

77
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,280
{\an5}Yes, which is why you will be
watching ours from right here.

78
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,880
Huh?

79
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,600
If you don't mind,

80
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,000
someone has to stay behind as backup.

81
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,920
I can't believe Ray got pined.

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,280
No suit, no powers, no tech.

83
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,840
I mean, I guess Sara

84
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,280
had no choice but to bench him.

85
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,000
Well, I... I'm sure she's just
trying to keep him safe.

86
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,560
This time period is replete

87
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,960
with various perils.

88
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,640
Perhaps it might be easier

89
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,600
{\an5}if he were to remain behind
and keep Dr. Palmer company.

90
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,360
Perhaps you should remain behind.

91
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,880
No? Because you're not black.

92
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,240
{\an5}Because you think that,
me going back to 1863,

93
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,640
{\an5}- I can't handle it.
- That doesn't mean

94
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,960
{\an5}there's a need for you
to subject yourself

95
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,920
{\an5}to the horrors
that await you in that era.

96
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,880
Okay, now,
I get it might be difficult

97
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,520
for you to understand this,

98
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,040
but I've been black
my entire life, Grey.

99
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,520
And honestly, I can't think
of a time period we could go to

100
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,680
where I wouldn't face
some sort of racism.

101
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,560
So don't worry. Okay?

102
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,240
Along with comms devices,
I also packed sacked lunches.

103
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,440
{\an5}I figured the food
in 1863 is pretty lousy.

104
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,280
All right, the operation is simple.

105
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,960
We isolate the target,
we eliminate the timeship,

106
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,360
and we get out of there.

107
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,200
And all while wearing this dress.

108
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
Come back safe.

109
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,840
<i>It's Mississippi, 1863.</i>

110
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,360
The weather
is a temperate 58 degrees.

111
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,640
Oh, a little trivia
you guys are in Hinds County,

112
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,120
<i>which was named
after General Thomas...</i>

113
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,960
Did you just...

114
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,440
- Shut off his comms?
- Yep.

115
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
Guys?

116
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,880
Guys?

117
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,560
I can't believe it.

118
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,080
It looks to be
some kind of escape pod.

119
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,040
No doubt, it fell out
of the Temporal Zone.

120
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,480
No sign of anyone.

121
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,000
Well, the power core looks exposed.

122
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,600
That mean what I think it means?

123
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,880
Only one way to find out.

124
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
Thought you'd never ask.

125
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,520
Back up, everyone.

126
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,120
Oh, what's next?

127
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Don't you think that's enough

128
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,400
incineration for one day, Mr. Rory?

129
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,880
No, I do not, Professor.

130
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,160
This is turning out to be
one of our easiest missions yet.

131
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,160
<i>Help me! Somebody, please!</i>

132
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,480
You had to say that, didn't you?

133
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
It's over there.

134
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,040
Help me! Help!

135
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,320
Whoa, wait, we're not
supposed to interfere

136
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
with historical events.

137
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,920
- Try and stop me.
- Oh, come...

138
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Women.

139
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,520
She certainly has a fiery spirit.

140
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,240
Which is either gonna get her killed

141
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,600
or completely screw up history.

142
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,920
Just end it, fast.

143
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,920
Let's get those Confederates
off his back.

144
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,880
Whoa, whoa. Relax.

145
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,400
All right, you're safe now.

146
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,800
What in tarnations was that?

147
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,600
- What did I just see?
- What was what?

148
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,920
I... I didn't see anything.

149
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,560
Who are you guys?

150
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,840
What's going on, here?

151
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,560
Look, we're just passing through.

152
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,200
Okay, guys, let's get the hell
out of here.

153
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,600
We can't just leave him here.

154
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,920
Well, unfortunately, we have to.

155
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,800
If we rescue one man,
we could alter history

156
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
in the wrong way.

157
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,080
You're dispatch, aren't you?

158
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,120
Wait, what's a dispatch?

159
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,560
It's a former slave providing
information to the Union Army.

160
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,400
My name is Henry Scott.

161
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,840
I'm a free man
from Trenton, New Jersey.

162
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,520
Well, you're a long way from home.

163
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,360
And we need to be getting
out of here.

164
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,960
Oh, guys?

165
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,880
Oh, my God.

166
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,160
Those Confederates look a lot like...

167
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
Don't... don't... don't say it!

168
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,400
Quick just merge!

169
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,880
Is everybody okay?

170
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
What the hell was that?

171
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,000
You ask me, they look like...

172
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,200
No! Please, don't say it.

173
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,080
I know they're essentially a myth,

174
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,720
but I have this irrational fear of...

175
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,440
- Zombies.
- Please, don't say it.

176
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,040
Oh, God.

177
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,480
Hey! Hey...hey...

178
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,240
- Hang on.
- Satch...

179
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,040
- What?
- My... satchel.

180
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Are you...

181
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Union?

182
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,880
- Kind of.
- My... my orders.

183
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,680
Collins Plantations.

184
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,320
Confederate troop movements.

185
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,760
Without them...

186
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,880
Hey. Hey!

187
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,400
Nice job blowing up
the Time Pirate's escape pod.

188
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,120
Put another win
in the mission column.

189
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,120
Did you not see
what happened next?

190
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,840
No, I took a break.
Had to go to the bathroom.

191
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,280
- You okay?
- We were attacked by zombies.

192
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,960
And someone put sprouts
on my sandwich.

193
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,360
The Time Pirate's distress call

194
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,240
referenced something called a TX-90.

195
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,800
It's a futuristic bioweapon.

196
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,040
The infected's condition
represents strongly

197
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,240
those things... that... I can't say.

198
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
And if that infected
Time Pirate is out there

199
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,760
spreading this virus,
then our work is not done here.

200
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
No kidding.

201
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,600
Having zombies, or whatever they are,

202
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,840
running around the Civil War
is not a good thing.

203
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,000
Speaking of not good.

204
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,160
Get him to the MedBay.

205
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,680
What's going on?

206
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,720
Apparently, you were wounded

207
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,360
during our encounter
with the infected.

208
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,560
Impossible.

209
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,320
Those creepy bastards
didn't lay a finger on me.

210
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,720
But they might
have gotten in a tooth.

211
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,920
Or 30.

212
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Oh, my God. He's already
starting to turn.

213
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
Ray, you got to fix me.

214
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,160
I don't want to be turned into
a fricking zombie.

215
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,400
Oh, my God.

216
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,440
Yeah, it's pretty disastrous.

217
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,400
I'm guessing, thanks to the zombies,

218
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,240
the Confederacy won
its independence from the Union.

219
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
It wasn't just them.

220
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,360
That guy, the dispatch,
these are his mission orders.

221
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,000
From General Ulysses S. Grant.

222
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
My God.

223
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,520
He was supposed to infiltrate
the Collins Plantation

224
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,440
and steal Confederate troop
movement orders.

225
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,760
They named a high school
after him?

226
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,200
That's because in the original
version of history,

227
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,200
the plans Scott stole helped Grant

228
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,960
win the Battle of Champion Hill.

229
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,760
And I'm guessing
none of that happened

230
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,000
because Scott was bayoneted
by a Confederate

231
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,480
turned into a zombie
by a future virus.

232
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,960
Okay, so...

233
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,160
- how do we fix it?
- We don't.

234
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,080
I do.

235
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,640
- Jax.
- There's a reason

236
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,360
black people were used as spies.

237
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,400
Because we were invisible.

238
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,640
That's why I'm going in there.

239
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
Don't worry.
If anything happens, it's on me.

240
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,520
No, Jax, it's on me.

241
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,680
Look, Mick is already hurt,
and I don't like the idea

242
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,160
of putting anyone else in harm's way.

243
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,320
And I don't like the idea
of having a flag

244
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,800
that has 20 stars on it.

245
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,640
I'm definitely not letting you
go in there alone.

246
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,200
Fine, I'll take Amaya.

247
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,000
All right. Nate and I will go

248
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,360
warn the Union Army
about the infected soldiers.

249
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
Okay.

250
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,440
When we get to wherever we're going,

251
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,800
maybe I should be the one

252
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,520
that breaks the zombie news
to General Grant.

253
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,840
I'm someone he'll listen to.

254
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,400
Because you're a man?

255
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,720
We're a couple hundred years
away from gender equality.

256
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,200
- Only a couple hundred?
- Look, all I'm saying is,

257
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,320
maybe... just maybe...
when we get to the Union Army,

258
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,200
- you let me do the talking.
- Wait where you are.

259
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,680
- Right there.
- Okay.

260
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,760
You do the talking.

261
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,680
So, what's our plan?

262
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,240
Well, if things go easy,

263
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,440
we sneak in while everybody's asleep,

264
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,880
find the Confederate plans,
and grab them.

265
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,880
Are things ever easy with your group?

266
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,800
- Oh, good point.
- Please, don't!

267
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,360
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to burn the table cloth!

268
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,440
It was an accident, I swear!

269
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,720
An accident? You just let yourself
get distracted, that's all.

270
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,160
While you should have been
thinking about the ironing,

271
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,600
you were probably daydreaming
about Ulysses S. Grant

272
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,360
marching down here to free
all the slaves.

273
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,240
No, sir. I wasn't.

274
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,480
Which is why

275
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,440
I need to focus your attention.

276
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,360
- No, no, no, wait.
- He's going to hurt her.

277
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,480
I know, and it's awful.

278
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,920
But if we blow our cover now,

279
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,800
we won't be able to fix
the Aberration.

280
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,440
And we might lose the Civil War.

281
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,760
Don't matter how much you cry.

282
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,880
I'm still gonna hurt you.

283
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,480
Raymond, please hurry.

284
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,760
I don't like the way this is going.

285
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,680
You don't like
the way this is going?

286
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,200
How close are you to
formulating a workable vaccine?

287
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,400
Very.

288
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,480
I think.

289
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Raymond.

290
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,920
I'm counting on you.

291
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,360
Don't worry, Mick. I got you.

292
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Here we go.

293
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,360
What's happening?

294
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,720
His heart rate's spiking.

295
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,680
Gideon, administer the sedative now!

296
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,840
Zombie! Zombie! Zombie!

297
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,240
- Screaming isn't helping.
- Zombie!

298
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,440
Gideon, put the ship on lockdown!

299
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,960
<i>Lockdown mode activated.</i>

300
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,600
This is incredible.

301
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,960
I did my sophomore thesis
on the Civil War.

302
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,160
I smell a history lesson coming.

303
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,600
Fun fact. Did you know,
out of the three million people

304
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,720
who fought on both sides,
300 were women in drag?

305
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,760
How is that not a fun fact for you?

306
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,680
General, we caught these two
outside the northeast perimeter.

307
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,880
This here is a war zone,
so either you two

308
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,560
are Confederate spies, or you...

309
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,560
are very lost.

310
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,680
Actually, we're neither,
General Grant.

311
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,480
How do you know my name?

312
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,200
I'm a fan. Actually, I'm, like,
a really big fan.

313
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,040
And you are surprisingly taller
than I thought in real life.

314
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,400
I'm a Colonel in the Union Army.

315
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,480
Colonel Sanders.

316
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,800
I'm Colonel Sanders

317
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,000
with the 31st Pennsylvania Infantry.

318
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,400
Then why are you not
in proper uniform, son?

319
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,440
My uniform's in the wash, sir.

320
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,360
Or you are a Confederate spy.

321
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,320
- Okay.
- Look, we're not Confederates.

322
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,880
And truth be told, we're not a part
of the Union either.

323
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
But we are here to tell you

324
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,400
that your company is in danger.

325
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,480
In danger?

326
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,880
Of... of what?

327
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,160
Well, believe it or not,

328
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,440
a horde of zombies
is headed your way.

329
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,760
What is a zombie?

330
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,680
They're not familiar with
that word for another 70 years.

331
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,080
- I've had enough nonsense.
- Look, it's not nonsense.

332
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,600
It's just really hard to explain.

333
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,440
And it would be a lot easier
if I just showed you.

334
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,800
And if I'm not back for any reason,

335
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
feel free to shoot him.

336
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,160
Just don't listen to her.

337
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,040
They're having some kind of party.

338
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,320
Oh, a Cotillion, actually.

339
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,720
According to Scott's mission papers,

340
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,520
he was going to get in
disguised as the help.

341
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,120
You mean slave?

342
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,760
We could have helped her.
We should have.

343
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,280
Look, I've been doing
this time travel thing

344
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,720
for a little while now.

345
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,480
And if I've learned one thing,
it's you never know

346
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,920
what's gonna change history
and have massive consequences.

347
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,040
What, you think this doesn't
make me angry as well?

348
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,320
But we have a job to do.

349
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,200
And if we don't do it,
we can make things a lot worse.

350
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,800
Just... just stay on comms, okay?

351
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,600
He was... he was... he... he...

352
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,840
Calm down, calm down.

353
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
We're going to die.

354
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,120
- You just need to calm down.
- I will not calm down.

355
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
He was threatening enough

356
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,320
before he was one
of the walking dead!

357
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,640
Why didn't your vaccine work?

358
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,960
I... I don't know.

359
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,720
It could be
that subcutaneous delivery

360
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,280
- needs more than one dose.
- Oh, and that didn't occur

361
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,440
to you while formulating your serum?

362
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,440
At least I'm not the one
with an irrational fear of zombies.

363
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,920
There's nothing irrational
about my fear of zombies.

364
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,200
He's a zombie!

365
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,440
Look, I'm pretty sure
that I stunned him.

366
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
Oh, you're pretty sure?

367
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,280
And if he's knocked out cold
in the MedBay,

368
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,640
all we have to do is go back in there

369
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,040
- and inject him again.
- And if he's not,

370
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,840
I'm pretty sure he'll kill us!

371
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,520
So, me and my irrational fear
are staying right here.

372
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Listen to me, Marty...

373
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,240
- Can I call you Marty?
- No.

374
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,760
You have to help me. If you don't,

375
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,720
and I get bitten, then you'll
have two zombies to deal with.

376
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,080
Oh, my God.

377
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,280
Amaya, it's Jax.

378
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,360
<i>The study's a bust,
I'm gonna check the rest</i>

379
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,480
<i>of the plantation house.</i>

380
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,040
I am so sorry, ma'am.

381
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,200
Boy, what did you just do?

382
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,840
I... I'm sorry.

383
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,640
You took that woman's hand
and addressed her directly.

384
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,760
No, sir, I... I did not.

385
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,720
You calling me a liar, boy?

386
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,400
I'm not calling you anything, sir.

387
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
Who the hell are you?

388
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm with the additional staff
for tonight's festivities.

389
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,480
Oh, so you're ignorant
about the house rules?

390
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,760
See, my staff know better
than to talk back to me.

391
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,800
I'm very sorry.

392
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,680
Won't happen again, sir.

393
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
Hey!

394
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,040
Don't you turn your back on me, boy.

395
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,840
There a problem, Mr. Collins?

396
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,600
Just a house boy
who don't know his place.

397
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,800
And needs to be taught some manners.

398
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,640
These zombies, they're...

399
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,280
they're going to kill all of you.

400
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,560
And I keep asking,

401
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,560
what in perdition's flames
is a zombie?

402
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,640
This.

403
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,480
I found him and 50 others
just like him

404
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,440
less than a mile outside
of your camp.

405
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,400
And, yeah, I said less than a mile.

406
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,720
Which means we don't have
a lot of time.

407
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,880
Okay.

408
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,960
You ready?

409
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,280
Just relax.

410
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,800
He's unconscious, remember?

411
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
Raymond.

412
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Yeah?

413
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,080
If he's unconscious,

414
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,080
wouldn't he be here?

415
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,160
This isn't working.
We need more sharpshooters.

416
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,440
I can't spare the men.

417
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,960
You see what is out there.

418
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,040
We have to think
about the battle that lies ahead.

419
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,000
If we don't take Vicksburg,
we won't control the Mississippi,

420
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,400
and we need command
of the river to win the war.

421
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,280
At this rate,
I'm afraid we will be out

422
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,720
of ammunition before dawn.

423
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,160
We need some backup.

424
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,360
Damn, it's dark.

425
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,080
Even if Mr. Rory
wasn't in a zombified state,

426
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,480
I doubt he possesses the intelligence

427
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,280
to operate a light switch.

428
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,800
Well, he probably just destroyed

429
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
a conduit or something.

430
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,480
Well, that's hardly comforting,
Raymond.

431
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
All right, come on!

432
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,600
He got me! He's got my foot.

433
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,520
- Oh, my God.
- Run, run!

434
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Come on.

435
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,760
This is a nightmare.

436
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,880
If Mr. Rory's intention
is to eat our brains,

437
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,800
can you imagine
the feast we'll provide him,

438
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,600
given our combined intellects?

439
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
Wait, wait!

440
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,800
Comfortable now?

441
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,480
You've got a long night ahead of you.

442
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Hey.

443
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,360
Damn it.

444
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,760
What is it?

445
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
It's...

446
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,320
it's... it's Jefferson.

447
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,760
- What's happening to him?
- I'm not sure

448
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,440
but I... I've never felt him so...

449
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,720
so frightened or angry before.

450
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,680
I knew I should have gone with him.

451
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,240
Well, Sara and Nate
are still out there.

452
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,320
Maybe they can get to him.

453
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,200
Ray, Martin.

454
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,120
I've lost contact with Jax and Amaya.

455
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,800
I really could
use some help out here.

456
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,360
I suppose there's your answer.

457
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,600
Here's the thing,
Sara we'd love to come help.

458
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,040
<i>But my vaccine didn't work,</i>

459
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,160
<i>and Mick got turned into
one of those things.</i>

460
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,800
And he's confined us to the galley.

461
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,800
Until we can cure him,

462
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,840
<i>you guys are on your own.</i>

463
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,560
Yeah, looks like we all are.

464
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Yeah.

465
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,840
Who are you?

466
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,360
My name's Jackson.

467
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,760
Jefferson Jackson.

468
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,960
Those are some pretty famous
slave owners

469
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,600
you're named for, Jefferson.

470
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,240
Look at his hands.

471
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,480
Have you ever worked
a day in your life?

472
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,840
It's a long story.

473
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,240
What are you doing here?

474
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,320
Also a long story.

475
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
Oh, actually...

476
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,680
Maybe... maybe you could help me.

477
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,720
I'm here for General Grant.

478
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,680
The Union general?

479
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,680
He sent me to steal details
of Confederate troop movements.

480
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,800
Even if you could
get your hands on them,

481
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,160
there ain't no way off this
plantation, Mr. Jackson.

482
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,160
- There's always a way.
- No.

483
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,480
Master Collins got guard dogs.

484
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,080
Cuban bloodhounds.

485
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,520
Yeah, we had some friends.

486
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,320
They got caught less than a mile out.

487
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
But they didn't kill them.

488
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,240
No, they didn't want to
lose the labor.

489
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,840
So they cut off their manhood.

490
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,120
And then hobbled them,
so they could never think of

491
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,200
trying to run again.

492
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,280
How do you endure this?

493
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,440
- How does it not...
- Drive us all mad?

494
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,320
Because that's what
they want it to do.

495
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,760
They think they can break us.

496
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,840
<i>When the sun comes up</i>

497
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,160
<i>And the first quail calls</i>

498
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,360
<i>Follow the drinking gourd</i>

499
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,720
<i>For the old man's a-waiting for</i>

500
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,360
<i>To carry you to freedom</i>

501
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,200
<i>Follow the drinking gourd</i>

502
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,800
Jax, are you there?

503
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,640
Damn.

504
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,040
Well, well, well.

505
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,240
Who invited you to the party?

506
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,920
Actually, my invitation must
have gotten lost in the mail.

507
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,400
You sure have a smart mouth on you.

508
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,000
Pretty one, though.

509
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,200
We'll have to teach
you a lesson on how to

510
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,840
talk to your betters.

511
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,080
We told Mick that we would save him.

512
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,400
Plus, I still have the vaccine.

513
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,800
We just have to figure out a way
to get it to work.

514
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,200
The vaccine wasn't effective
when we injected Mick.

515
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,600
But if we can aerosolize the serum,

516
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,960
and deploy it using something
like a fire extinguisher,

517
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,680
we could deliver the cure as a spray.

518
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,440
We're not doing anything.

519
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,040
But you, on the other hand...

520
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,920
Look, Marty,
I know that you're scared.

521
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,160
I've been nothing but scared
since my suit was destroyed.

522
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,400
I've been terrified that I have
nothing to offer the team.

523
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,600
But you have to get over your fears

524
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,840
if we're gonna survive this.

525
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,600
We've only seen these things
downwind from here.

526
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,360
We can pick them off in this valley

527
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,520
until they're all gone.

528
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,320
I got my best men on
the ridge to the West.

529
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,560
But reports are, they
are running out of ammunition.

530
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,480
What?

531
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
Helps me think.

532
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,160
Well, without ammo, we can't take

533
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,400
all these zombies out,
even with perfect shots.

534
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,680
Can I talk to you for a minute?

535
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,760
Yeah.

536
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,240
Mr. Collins is gonna love

537
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,640
spending the midnight
hour with you, girlie.

538
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,960
I'm looking forward to it.

539
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,840
I hope he enjoys
getting punched in the face.

540
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,520
And thank you ever so much
for showing me

541
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,080
where to find my friend.

542
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
What the hell was that?

543
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,680
Don't you know a breakout
when you see one?

544
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
Okay.

545
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,760
Good. Now let's free them.

546
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,680
I thought you said
if we didn't do our job,

547
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,640
we could end up doing
more harm than good.

548
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,000
Yeah, that's still a risk.

549
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,200
So what's changed?

550
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,880
The way these people
are being treated...

551
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,200
that's the real Aberration.

552
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,120
I can see that now.

553
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,480
This is the history
that needs to be fixed.

554
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,600
No, no, I'm obliged, ma'am,
but I told you

555
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,960
what happens if they catch us.

556
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
Don't worry.

557
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,240
We're gonna protect you.

558
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,680
I know you're scared.

559
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
I get it.

560
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,440
Don't ask me how I know this,
but it gets better.

561
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,560
Not perfect.
Nowhere near close. But...

562
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,600
better than this.

563
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,000
But it starts right now

564
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,720
with us not giving up.

565
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
Zambezi.

566
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,360
Your amulet.

567
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,360
You are a warrior of the Zambezi.

568
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,520
You're familiar with it.

569
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,320
That's where my mother was born.

570
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,960
We must follow her.

571
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,520
I believe in her.

572
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,880
I believe in them.

573
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
Then I do, too.

574
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,000
- What is it?
- We got company.

575
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,520
We've got to get out of here.

576
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,120
Not without the Confederate plans.

577
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
I think I know where they are.

578
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,360
Okay, you, get everyone to safety.

579
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,240
- Come on.
- Wait, Jax.

580
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,520
Good luck.

581
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
You ready?

582
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
Come on!

583
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
This way.

584
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
Go.

585
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Mr. Jackson.

586
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,840
What are you doing, man?

587
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,920
For when things get better,
like you said.

588
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,120
Okay, come on.

589
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,520
What in Sam Hill are these things?

590
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,000
They're infected with something.

591
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,360
We got to work together,

592
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,960
or we'll never make it
out of here alive.

593
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,160
What are you saying?

594
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,880
I'm saying give us weapons.

595
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,840
Without us, you'll never be able
to fight them off.

596
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,960
You think I'm dumb enough
to arm my own slaves?

597
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,440
- Come on!
- Help!

598
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,960
For God's sake, help me!

599
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,240
We are down to our last rounds

600
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,760
with no hope of stopping
those abominations.

601
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,920
Whatever you have up your sleeve,
I suggest you play

602
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,240
that card now, Ms. Lance.

603
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,400
We are working on it.

604
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,320
- You good?
- Am I good?

605
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,440
Well, considering
my survival hinges on me

606
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,280
accessing a superpower
I'm not familiar with,

607
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,360
I'm a little...

608
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,400
Run fast, run hard, don't die.

609
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
Okay.

610
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,680
I can promise you
two of those things.

611
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
I'm in the MedBay.

612
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,800
<i>Be careful, Raymond.</i>

613
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,440
<i>It won't take long for Mr. Rory
to figure out where you are.</i>

614
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,400
Tell me something I don't know.

615
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,840
Party's over!

616
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,520
Those things are right outside
the perimeter.

617
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,440
Kill the lights and hold your fire.

618
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,920
Hey, over here!

619
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,280
Come and get it, you ugly freaks!

620
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,800
Follow me, you big dummies!

621
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,600
Come on! Follow the light!

622
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
Raymond?

623
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,160
Raymond, where are you?

624
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,840
What happened?

625
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,920
Oh, no. Don't be dead, Raymond.

626
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,200
On the other hand, if you are dead,

627
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,800
please stay dead.

628
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,200
Just unconscious, well done.

629
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,400
Now, where's that fire extinguisher?

630
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,240
Okay, Martin.

631
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,760
Just do what they did...

632
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,400
in those zombie movies...

633
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,520
that you never
had the courage to watch.

634
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,440
Come on!

635
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,400
That gentleman
is either the bravest man

636
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,200
I have ever had in my ranks,

637
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,960
or the dumbest.

638
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,960
If, if you'd if you'd just cooperate

639
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,320
things will go much easier for us.

640
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,080
You may be stronger,
but I assure you,

641
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,800
you will not eat me today.

642
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,760
Professor, what's going on?

643
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,000
Was I just trying to kiss you?

644
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,840
I could only hope, Mr. Rory.

645
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,240
I can only hope.

646
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,640
- Everybody good?
- Yeah.

647
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,080
Jax, we've got to go.

648
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,040
This fire is gonna attract
a lot of unwanted attention.

649
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
I know.

650
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,520
I want to enjoy this for a moment.

651
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,920
Okay.

652
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,960
You see your man anywhere?

653
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,360
What the?

654
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,520
Wait, hold your fire.

655
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,240
Nate?

656
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,520
I am covered in zombie guts.

657
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,680
But you're alive.

658
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,280
I think I'm gonna be sick.

659
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,240
This is a godsend.

660
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,840
We know how the rebels
are planning to take Champion Hill,

661
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,840
and when they do,
we will be there to give them hell.

662
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,000
Set our cannon battery up
on the western ridge.

663
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,360
- Yes, sir.
- We will light them up

664
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,760
like the Fourth of July

665
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,160
when they roll over that hill.

666
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,920
- What's your name, son?
- Oh, it's Ja...

667
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,120
Henry Scott.

668
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,480
Mr. Scott, thank you
for your incredible bravery

669
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,200
and your service
to the United States.

670
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,720
You may have
just won this war for us.

671
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,120
Are these men and women
from the Collins Plantation?

672
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,280
Yes, they are, sir.

673
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,840
We will care
for anyone seeking refuge

674
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,440
in our camp
from the Confederate states.

675
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,960
We have plenty
of food and water for everyone.

676
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,520
Thank you.

677
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,080
We've spread the vaccine
our friends worked up.

678
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,720
The only Confederates
you'll have to worry about now

679
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,760
are the living ones.

680
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,840
I'm obliged.

681
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,520
Oh, your man Colonel Sanders, he...

682
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,000
tells me you're his captain.

683
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,840
In any case, he mentioned
something about

684
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,520
you having regrets
about putting men in harm's way.

685
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,360
I don't think that's something
I can ever get used to.

686
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,440
You know, by the time
I had taken over this division,

687
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,320
there had already
been three other generals

688
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,400
in place before me.

689
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,200
They'd all stepped down and given up.

690
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,960
But I believe in my men.

691
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,680
And I believe in the good
that we're doing.

692
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,720
Do you?

693
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,680
Do you believe in your mission,
Captain Lance?

694
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,560
I do.

695
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,160
Well, then, don't regret
making those tough decisions.

696
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
Ma'am.

697
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,160
- Hey.
- Hey.

698
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,080
Just checking up on you.

699
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,560
I don't feel like eating
anyone's brain, so...

700
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
thank you.

701
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,480
Well, maybe you feel like
eating a burger.

702
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
No sprouts.

703
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,720
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

704
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,480
- Well, there's a little something.
- I had to ask, didn't I?

705
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,760
It's just, I don't think it's
any secret that without my suit,

706
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,960
I've been wondering
what my place on the team is.

707
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,080
If...

708
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,960
I even have a place, you know?

709
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,080
Being an outsider is a good thing.

710
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,160
It's a great thing.

711
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,200
I've been an outsider my whole life.

712
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,640
You get to tell people to go
shove it.

713
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,440
What are you doing?

714
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,240
Something I hope I don't regret.

715
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,160
This belonged to the greatest
outsider I ever knew.

716
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,240
I'm looking for a partner.

717
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,440
Cool.

718
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,120
What on Earth are you doing?

719
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,520
Oh, oh, scrimshaw.

720
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,040
It's... was my mom's thing.

721
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,240
She taught me a little.

722
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,240
Makes me think of her.

723
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,680
I had no idea.

724
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,680
Are you homesick?

725
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,360
You checking up on me, Grey?

726
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,440
Given what you've witnessed,
what you've endured,

727
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,960
would that really be so bad?

728
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,200
No.

729
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,560
You've just witnessed

730
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,720
the very worst of humanity.

731
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,120
We share a psychic connection,
but I still can't even

732
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,280
begin to fathom
what you must be feeling.

733
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
It must be...

734
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,080
like your heart is broken.

735
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,360
Yeah. It is.

736
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,800
But I saw something
in those people's eyes

737
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,480
I... I didn't expect to see.

738
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,600
I saw hope.

739
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,960
I saw dignity.

740
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,120
Those men and women,

741
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,880
they were treated worse than animals.

742
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,120
But they never let anybody
stop them from being people.

743
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,640
You know?

744
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,960
I suppose there will always be
those who will seek to

745
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,440
dehumanize us.

746
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,320
But I believe there are more

747
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,920
that cling to hope,

748
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,360
despite the darkness.

749
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,600
Yeah, that is exactly how they were.

750
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,040
I was actually thinking of you,
Jefferson.

751
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,280
<i>When the sun comes up</i>

752
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,600
<i>And the first quail calls</i>

753
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,360
<i>Follow the drinking gourd</i>

754
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,520
<i>For the old man's a-waiting for</i>

755
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,200
<i>To carry you to freedom</i>

756
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,960
<i>Follow the drinking gourd</i>
