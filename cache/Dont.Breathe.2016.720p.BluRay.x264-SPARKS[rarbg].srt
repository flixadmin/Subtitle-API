1
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,816
Are you sure you have the right keys?

2
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,240
Trust me, it's the right key.

3
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,771
Okay, then, open the door.

4
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,446
It shouldn't be taking so long, man.

5
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,367
20, 19, 18...

6
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,284
Rocky, those are very slow seconds.

7
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,336
- Yo, kill that already.
- 17, 16...

8
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,203
- Dude, come on.
- 15, 14, 13...

9
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,683
- This is what I'm talking about.
- 12, 11, 10, 9...

10
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,963
I told you this was gonna be fancy.

11
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,288
All right, so, just like last time.

12
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,376
No cash.
The total take has to fall below ten G's.

13
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,536
Yeah, yeah. Whatever, Judge Judy.

14
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,686
- Come on.
- Let's do this.

15
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,851
<i>Okay, let's get out of here.</i>

16
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,764
Hey, Rocky, did you hear
that Kopecky's moving away?

17
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,849
Everybody's leaving.

18
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,122
You know, if we keep hitting
houses like today's...

19
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,327
Rocky, and...

20
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,130
Bye-bye, Detroit.

21
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,647
And hola, California.

22
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,685
Wait, wait.
You're going away, Rock?

23
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,808
Yeah, as soon as I can.

24
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,082
When are you,
when are you coming back?

25
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,560
Never.

26
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,683
You should come with us.

27
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,410
Uh...

28
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,164
What?

29
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,924
Everyone else is gone.

30
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,202
I got my dad here.

31
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,289
I'll miss you, then.

32
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,162
Dad?

33
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,482
You home?

34
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,931
Yo, this is it, man?

35
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,168
Minus my 40 percent.

36
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,765
Take it or leave it.

37
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,376
There's a fucking Rolex in there, bro.

38
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,811
And what do you think...

39
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,651
I'm going to put it up
for auction at Sotheby's? Heh.

40
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,446
Do you know how much...

41
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,728
people on the street pay
for a hot Rolex?

42
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,167
Heh. You want money?

43
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,209
Then steal money.

44
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,771
Fucking bullshit, bro.

45
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,004
Do you want this new tip or not?

46
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,490
All right, let's hear it.

47
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,166
<i>1837 Buena Vista Street.</i>

48
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,000
House is with
your dad's security company.

49
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,485
I already checked.

50
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,484
Guy who owns it
is an Army vet loner.

51
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,005
No family.

52
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,326
Just him in the house.

53
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,896
That part of the city is a ghost town.

54
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,126
It looks like a dump.

55
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,520
That's actually good news.

56
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,011
How's that good news?

57
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,491
The story goes...

58
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,165
some preppy girl
a few years ago...

59
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,924
ran over this guy's daughter.

60
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,969
- Jesus.
- The daughter dies...

61
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,521
and this preppy,
rich-ass family...

62
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,404
pays him off...

63
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,050
gives him a big-ass sediment.

64
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,929
Settlement.

65
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,570
Blow me, Your Honor.

66
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,282
All right, this guy
is sitting on at least...

67
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,642
300K.

68
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,609
Boom!

69
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,923
I mean, if I deliver
this stake to Raul, man...

70
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,605
he will shit his pants.

71
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,922
Do you think the money's
in the house?

72
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,202
I don't know.
Let's go find out.

73
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,691
Guys, no. We don't do cash.

74
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,205
Above ten K, it's major larceny.

75
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,840
That means ten years
if we get caught.

76
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,883
- We won't get caught.
- Okay, and then what?

77
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,680
That amount brings
a serious cop presence.

78
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,960
They'll do an investigation.

79
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,160
My dad could get in trouble.

80
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,526
I knew you'd bitch out, man.

81
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,603
I just knew it.

82
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,088
Alex, if we do this right,
we never have to do it again.

83
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,482
Where are you going?

84
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,371
We're not doing this one.

85
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,807
Seriously?

86
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,849
Give us the fucking keys, man.

87
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,286
- We'll fucking do it.
- Alex!

88
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,888
"Gulf War veteran reaches
six-figure settlement."

89
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,561
Six-figure settlement.

90
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,086
All right.

91
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,376
<i>The suspect was leaving...</i>

92
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,616
<i>the rear entrance of the club.</i>

93
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,722
<i>Are you done, Eddy'?</i>

94
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,404
Be a doll and get your mother...

95
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,528
a large four-cheese from Tony's.

96
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,096
- So Trevor's living here now?
- Don't be a bitch, Roxanne.

97
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,016
It's just a few months
till he can find a new job.

98
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,884
You have no money in here.

99
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,168
You pay for it then.

100
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,209
I know you're making money.

101
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,966
I'm done.

102
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,407
Your lips look sore.

103
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,847
That's how you're making
your cash out there?

104
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,241
Ha, ha. Huh?

105
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,248
Okay, Diddy,
let's go for a walk.

106
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,967
I want to go to the beach.

107
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,329
Yeah, well,
it's not summer, monkeyhead.

108
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,767
I want to be a surfer.

109
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,730
There's no surf in Michigan.

110
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,365
- Not fair.
- Yeah, well...

111
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,322
some things
you can't change, baby.

112
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,484
No matter how unfair they are.

113
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,563
What a bummer.

114
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,208
Hey, you know
where there is surf?

115
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,810
California.

116
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,531
What do you say
you and I move there together?

117
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,761
Would you like that?

118
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,490
Okay.

119
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,051
I promise then.

120
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,645
Is that a new tattoo?

121
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,881
Yeah.

122
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,241
I got it last night.

123
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,568
- Ls it a...?
- Ladybug.

124
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,570
Why a ladybug?

125
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,962
What?

126
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,328
When my dad left,
my mom started drinking...

127
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,807
and she told me that...

128
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,725
my dad's leaving was all my fault.

129
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,489
And I missed him a lot, so I'd cry.

130
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,682
She got so fed up with the crying...

131
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,366
that she would lock me
in the trunk of her car.

132
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,921
Sometimes for hours.

133
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,369
But there was this, um...

134
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,482
A little hole in the trunk...

135
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,449
and one time a ladybug flew in...

136
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,365
kept me company.

137
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,363
It made me feel safe.

138
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,321
When I reach California,
I'm gonna color this tat...

139
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,926
and that's the last time
I will mark my body.

140
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,169
If we get this money,
I'm going away with you guys.

141
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,687
I know you will.

142
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,329
At least four blocks around,
houses aren't occupied.

143
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,167
No people means
no Five-0 on patrol.

144
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,731
It's gonna be a piece of cake.

145
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,490
The guy's a shut-in...

146
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,400
hasn't left his house
in, like, five days.

147
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,925
I say we do it with him
in the house.

148
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,525
I'll get a chloro-bomb.

149
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,161
Oh, shit!

150
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,560
- Jesus.
- Fucking A.

151
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,040
Get off my fucking car, dog shit!

152
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,204
Shit, that's our guy.

153
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,170
Wait, is he blind?

154
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,563
He lost his sight in Iraq or something.

155
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,121
That's kind of fucked up
to rob a blind guy, isn't it?

156
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,680
Just because he's blind don't
mean he's a fucking saint, bro.

157
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,241
We do this tonight.

158
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,842
The whole neighborhood
is fucking empty.

159
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,480
This guy's the last man standing.

160
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,281
The lights are out.

161
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,441
He must be asleep.

162
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,409
He's blind.

163
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,971
Lights off doesn't mean anything.

164
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,167
It's 2 a.m.

165
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,971
He's sleeping.

166
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,963
Let's take care
of that dog first, yeah?

167
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,731
Come on, man.

168
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,761
He's chewing it.

169
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,285
It'll be lights out in a sec.

170
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,601
There's four locks.
You got the other keys?

171
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,728
- I only have the one.
- Ah. Fuck me.

172
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,327
Why wouldn't he give backup
keys to the security company?

173
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,845
Because the money's in there...

174
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,685
and the paranoid fuck
doesn't trust nobody.

175
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,604
Let's check for a side door.

176
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,650
Sweet dreams, pup.

177
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,721
What's that?

178
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,336
We just have to point this
in the general direction...

179
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,696
of the master keypad,
and it'll kill the alarm.

180
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,564
Okay, open the fucking door, Dexter.

181
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,602
Yes. Got it.

182
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,841
Shit.

183
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,240
What's wrong?

184
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,646
It won't open.

185
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,325
This guy isn't messing around.

186
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,246
There's a bolt here.

187
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,129
I can feel it.

188
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,805
- Come on.
- That's too loud.

189
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,883
- That's too loud.
- Fucking stop.

190
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,126
What about that window?

191
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,327
There's no bars on it.

192
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,760
- I can fit in there.
- What?

193
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,962
No, we're not sending you
in there alone.

194
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,685
Nobody's sending me anywhere.

195
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,842
I'm going myself.

196
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,011
Help me up.

197
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,321
Here, Rocky.

198
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,481
You only got 30 seconds.

199
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,641
Okay.

200
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,529
Here. Come here.

201
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,645
Slow your roll, fool.

202
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,928
She must have got it by now.
She's fine.

203
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,251
Yeah, like you really give a fuck.

204
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,050
What'd you say?

205
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,362
That's my bitch in there.

206
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,443
Of course I give a fuck.

207
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,807
Let me give you some advice.

208
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,405
Be a good friend...

209
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,325
and stay in the fucking
friend zone, all right?

210
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,321
Are you okay?

211
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,766
Yes.

212
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,684
Shoes off.

213
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,604
- What the fuck?
- Hey.

214
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,961
Hey. Hey.

215
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,924

What the fuck, dude?

The guy's gassed out.

250
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,046
He's out.

251
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,336
He's in Sleeping Beauty mode.

252
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,124
- It's fine.
- Guys.

253
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,046
That's a big-ass lock.

254
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,202
If the money's in the house...

255
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,170
probably in there.

256
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,288
You think you can crack it open?

257
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,970
Yeah, I got this.

258
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,165
Fuck.

259
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,690
Jesus.

260
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,081
Do you have anything else?

261
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,605
Yeah.

262
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,966
Yeah, yeah.

263
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,487
I've got a more powerful tool.

264
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,730
What the hell is that?

265
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,405
It's a nine millimeter Beretta.

266
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,642
Gangster-style, bitches.

267
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,165
Why did you bring a gun?

268
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,129
This is a soldier's house, Alex.

269
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,896
Like I'm gonna come in here
without some chrome.

270
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,810
Money, you've never shot a gun before.

271
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,088
Yeah, well, it's time
to pop that cherry, baby.

272
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,136
Because I'm going to pop that
shit like a fucking tuna can.

273
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,736
Do you have any idea
what bringing a gun...

274
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,841
to a burglary means?

275
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,490
Yeah, it gives me...

276
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,529
a better chance
to defend myself, Alex.

277
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,896
No, it means
you just gave this guy...

278
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,127
the legal right to shoot us.

279
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,408
Rocky, let's go.

280
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,767
No, no, no, no.
I think we should stay.

281
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,042
We have to leave.
This is not good.

282
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,016
You don't really think just because...

283
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,536
you jerk off
to her Instagram selfies...

284
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,483
that makes you a Romeo?

285
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,005
Think again, bitch.

286
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,845
Fuck, I'm so out.

287
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,483
Alex.

288
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,404
Who's there?

289
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,130
Okay, man, just chill, all right?

290
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,760
Look, um...

291
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,763
I was wasted...

292
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,968
and I wandered in,
so that was my bad, all right?

293
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,451
So, I'm just gonna...

294
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,443
I'm just gonna leave, okay?

295
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,650
Stay right fucking there.

296
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,410
Don't you fucking move.

297
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,724
Yeah, that's right.

298
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,167
I know what's in there,
and I ain't leaving without it.

299
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,765
You got me?

300
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,526
Now, you do as I say, all right?

301
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,684
Don't take one single step,
all right? Huh?

302
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,290
Well, do you hear me or what?

303
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,205
What, are you blind and deaf
all of a sudden?

304
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,441
Huh?

305
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,331
Motherfucker, I said stop.

306
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,687
I think you fucking heard me.

307
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,683
- Sorry.
- Don't you move.

308
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,896
What the fuck are you doing,
you old man?

309
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,570
I'll fucking shoot you.

310
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,126
Don't you fucking test me.

311
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,731
You're a fucking pussy.

312
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,961
What are you gonna do now,
huh? Huh?

313
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,043
You better fucking stop. Stop!

314
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,768
Don't make me fucking kill you, man.

315
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,924
Please.

316
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,320
Please.

317
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,371
Please, just let me walk.

318
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,091
Let me walk.
Leave me alive.

319
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,486
Please.

320
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,445
How many of you are there?

321
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,051
What?

322
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,850
How many?

323
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,844
It's just me, man...

324
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,004
all right? It's just fucking me.
Just let me go!

325
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,964
Please let me go.

326
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,209
Please.

327
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,769
Just let me go.

328
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,807
Okay. Okay.

329
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,486
Okay.

330
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,886
Okay, I swear to God...

331
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,802
Rocky, hey, are you okay?

332
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,042
Are you okay?

333
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,009
Maybe... Maybe we should...

334
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,446
call the cops before he does.

335
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,369
We'll come clean...

336
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,650
Wait.

337
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,802
What?

338
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,001
Oh, my God.

339
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,326
There's a lot more
than 300 grand in there.

340
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,801
That's got to be
about a million dollars.

341
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,362
Okay, let's get out of here.

342
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,091
The storm cellar door.
The door's bolted from the inside.

343
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,322
That could be our way out.

344
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,403
Let's go.

345
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,209
Let's go.

346
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,329
This way.

347
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,567
What?

348
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,724
Oh, shit.
The phone died.

349
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,723
Oh, fuck.

350
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,961
Hmm.

351
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,286
Hmm.

352
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,364
- Where's the door?
- I don't know.

353
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,040
Where is it? Do you see it?

354
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,731
Please help me! Please!

355
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,201
We need to get the fuck
out of here right now.

356
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,091
Come on. Let's go.

357
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,571
Look, the door's right here.

358
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,610
Look! Look at it!

359
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,001
Please!

360
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,724
What?

361
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,928
Rocky? Rocky.

362
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,407
Rocky, listen, listen.

363
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,607
Hey, that's our exit.

364
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,920
The door's right fucking there.
We can leave right now.

365
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,923
No, no, no, no!

366
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,324
She's the one
who killed his daughter.

367
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,726
We have to get her out of here.

368
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,803
No, no, no.
Rocky, we don't have time.

369
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,136
We'll... We'll get out of here,
and we'll call the cops...

370
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,576
and then they'll
come find her, all right?

371
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,284
The safe! The safe!

372
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,925
There's the safe!

373
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,760
The code from the safe upstairs.

374
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,888
- You remember it?
- Um...

375
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,326
2978, 78, 78, 2978.

376
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,131
2-9-7-8.

377
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,526
Oh...

378
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,967
Okay, got them.

379
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,891
He's coming.

380
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,606
- Hurry up.
- Okay, one more, one more.

381
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,762
Fuck, fuck!

382
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,850
I almost have it.
Almost... okay.

383
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,176
I don't care what you did.
I'll get you out of here.

384
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,441
Go, go, go!

385
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,644
- There's the door.
- There it is.

386
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,681
Are you okay?

387
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,921
Okay.

388
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,725
What's wrong?

389
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,361
What's wrong?

390
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,567
It's locked.

391
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,167
You have the keys.
Don't you have the keys?

392
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,287
Fuck.

393
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,560
One of these should open it.

394
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,846
Come on.

395
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,320
Come on.

396
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,646
- Come on.
- Okay.

397
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,285
Oh, yes.

398
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,011
Come on.

399
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,648
He shot her.

400
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,161
No...

401
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,321
Oh.

402
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,361
No!

403
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,086
No!

404
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,323
Oh! Oh! Oh!

405
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,081
My baby.

406
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,601
No!

407
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,729
No!

408
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,886
No!

409
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,449
We have to go back upstairs.

410
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,125
Yeah, listen.

411
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,725
Listen, okay?

412
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,880
These keys, they match
the locks on the front door.

413
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,126
All right?

414
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,362
If we get up there,
we can get out.

415
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,284
Okay?

416
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,046
Let's go now.

417
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,088
Shit.

418
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,121
Alex?

419
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,081
Rocky?

420
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,690
Please don't...

421
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,122
No, please...

422
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,647
Rocky?

423
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,723
Alex! Alex.

424
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,166
Rocky, Rocky.

425
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,321
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.

426
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,682
This way. This way, come on.

427
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,096
This way, come on, come on, come on.

428
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,406
Okay.

429
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,040
Oh, come on. Where am I?

430
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,366
Where is it?

431
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,249
Light. I see light!

432
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,243
Come on, come on.

433
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,371
Don't...

434
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,646
run.

435
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,090
Rocky...

436
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,324
go to the door.

437
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,045
Try the blue key.

438
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,605
- Do it.
- Okay.

439
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,121
Easy.

440
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,401
Easy, buddy.

441
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,046
Fuck.

442
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,568
- Rocky?
- Yeah.

443
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,407
- Come on.
- Easy, buddy.

444
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,800
Easy...

445
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,361
It's okay.

446
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,562
Okay, that's a good boy.
That's good.

447
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,881
All right.

448
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,806
That's...
That's good. That's good.

449
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,726
Oh. Fuck.

450
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,608
Rocky! Rocky.
Run, now. Go, go, go!

451
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,444
Upstairs, now. Go. Go, go!

452
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,240
Go! Hurry, hurry!

453
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,166
Go!

454
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,367
There's a door! Come on!

455
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,761
Let's go.

456
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,360
Hey, move this.

457
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,806
Come on.

458
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,685
Damn.

459
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,882
- Are those blocked up too?
- Yeah.

460
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,769
We're trapped in here.

461
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,328
Rocky, the remote.
Do you have it with you?

462
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,766
Come on. Okay.

463
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,576
- What are you doing?
- I'm pressing the panic button.

464
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,696
If I manage to get in range,
the system will call 911...

465
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,160
- and the police will come.
- No. Wait, we can't go to jail.

466
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,691
No. No, we won't. Okay?

467
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,640
This is robbery
versus kidnapping and murder.

468
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,120
The police won't care about us...

469
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,576
or why we were here
in the first place.

470
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,120
We would have helped them
get this guy.

471
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,640
But then we wouldn't
keep the money.

472
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,608
- We need to get out of this room.
- Up there.

473
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,923
Go!

474
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,850
Alex!

475
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,002
What are you doing? Go!

476
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,850
No! No, no!

477
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,886
Oh!

478
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,762
Hey!

479
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,370
Huh, huh!

480
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,563
Ah...

481
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,086
Ah.

482
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,050
Please, let me go.

483
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,928
Please, let me go!

484
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,406
.1111

485
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,289
I understand you.

486
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,930
She killed your daughter.

487
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,570
You wanted her to pay.

488
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:43,761
I understand that.

489
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,490
I won't tell anyone.

490
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,648
You understand nothing.

491
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,724
Only a parent could know the...

492
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,327
bond between a father
and his child.

493
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:03,083
She should have
gone to prison, but...

494
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,442
rich girls don't go to jail.

495
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,561
None of this is going
to bring your daughter back.

496
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,527
That's not really true.

497
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:28,084
Cindy took my child
away from me.

498
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,881
I thought...

499
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,441
it's only fair...

500
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,083
that she give me a new one.

501
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,687
She was pregnant with my baby.

502
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,964
You killed them both.

503
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,765
- No.
- Well, they would be alive...

504
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,406
if you hadn't broken
into my home.

505
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,766
No.

506
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,606
You have to be held accountable.

507
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,406
Please.

508
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,965
Please, God.

509
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,281
God?

510
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,363
There's no God.

511
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,570
It's a joke.

512
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:39,690
It's a bad joke.

513
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:44,528
You tell me what God
would allow this.

514
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,770
What are you doing?

515
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:57,046
I'm not a rapist.

516
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,209
I never forced myself on her.

517
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,089
Stop.

518
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,527
I promised I would set her free...

519
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,887
just as soon
as she gave me a child.

520
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,362
But now she's gone.

521
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,488
But I'm done waiting.

522
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,808
Ah! No. No, no.

523
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,965
You can't do this to me.

524
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,889
There's nothing a man cannot do...

525
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,607
once he accepts the fact
that there is no God.

526
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,410
No!

527
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,006
No. No, no, no, no!

528
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,241
No!

529
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,007
No!

530
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,286
You're strong.

531
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:17,966
You're young.

532
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,560
You'll breed well.

533
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,688
No. Get away from me.

534
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,844
No! No!

535
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,244
No!

536
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,611
No...

537
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,604
Stop.

538
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,886
Shh, Shh, shh.

539
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,206
Nine months...

540
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:43,170
and I will give you
your life back.

541
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,322
Are you okay?

542
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:25,766
Rocky. Okay, yeah.

543
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,440
Rocky, did he...?
Did he hurt you?

544
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,806
Rocky?

545
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,888
You fucking bastard.

546
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,327
Fuck you!

547
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:49,481
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, Rocky. Rocky.

548
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:52,246
Rocky. Rocky, it's over.
Come on.

549
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,090
How's that taste?

550
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,365
- Now what?
- Come on.

551
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,684
You're going to rot in prison
for what you've done.

552
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,360
Rocky, we can't
involve the cops now.

553
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,409
If we steal a million in cash...

554
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:19,336
and then lead the cops here,
he'll tell them about us.

555
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,124
Our blood is all over.

556
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,486
They'll get to us in a second.

557
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:25,445
You got what you came for.

558
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,324
Now take it.

559
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,682
Get out of my house!

560
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,410
Look, he's buying our silence.

561
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,130
He needs us to take the money.

562
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,044
It's one or the other.

563
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:46,927
Whatever you choose,
I'm with you.

564
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,245
- Okay.
- This one.

565
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,129
Let's get out of here.

566
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,566
I need to find the key.

567
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,091
All right.

568
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,729
That key won't...

569
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,247
I got it.

570
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,088
You're worthless out here.

571
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,451
Fuck.

572
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,171
Shit!

573
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,006
Fuck.

574
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,401
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

575
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:44,891
Ah, fuck!

576
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,167
I'm sorry, Alex.

577
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,401
I'm so sorry.

578
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,041
No!

579
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,403
Don't!

580
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,244
Ah, no...

581
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,849
No. Ah...

582
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,365
Ah! Don't...

583
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,601
No.

584
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,570
What is that?

585
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,809
You and me at the beach.

586
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,602
Train service to Los Angeles...

587
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:11,081
<i>will be boarding shortly
on platform six.</i>

588
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,096
<i>This house
behind me on Buena Vista...</i>

589
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,884
<i>belongs to a retired Army vet...</i>

590
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,963
<i>who fought
for our country in Iraq...</i>

591
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,691
<i>and lost his sight as a result
of a grenade splinter.</i>

592
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,009
<i>Last night, two burglars
broke into his home...</i>

593
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,931
<i>and attempted to rob
and brutally attack him.</i>

594
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:31,363
<i>This visually impaired man
was able to defend himself...</i>

595
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,761
<i>shooting and killing
both his attackers on the spot.</i>

596
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,088
<i>Now, the man did
sustain some injuries...</i>

597
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,000
<i>but doctors say he is
in stable condition.</i>

598
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,447
<i>He'll be released
from the hospital soon...</i>

599
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,523
<i>and able to return to his home.</i>

600
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:45,968
<i>No goods were reported stolen
by the victim.</i>

601
