1
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,030
This the wall
she was talking about, Chief?

2
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,210
A trooper found
something in the, uh...

3
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,090
water that's at the quarry.

4
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,430
Our working theory right now
is that Will...

5
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,060
crashed his bike, he...
made his way over the quarry and, uh...

6
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,100
accidentally fell in.

7
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,560
The earth must have given way.

8
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,730
Joyce?

9
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,200
Joyce?

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,950
Do you understand what I'm saying?

11
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,240
No.

12
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,450
Whoever you found...

13
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,040
is not my boy.

14
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,960
- It's not Will.
- Joyce.

15
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,210
No, you don't understand.

16
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,040
I talked to him...

17
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,550
a half hour ago.

18
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,720
He was...
He was here.

19
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,090
He was...
He was talking with these.

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
- Talking?
- Uh-huh.

21
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,220
One blink for yes, two for no.

22
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,810
And... And, uh...

23
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,770
And then I made this
so he could talk to me.

24
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,190
'Cause he was hiding...

25
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,360
from that... that thing.

26
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,876
The thing that came out of the wall?

27
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,176
- The thing that chased you?
- Yeah.

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,410
- Yeah.
- Mom, come on, please.

29
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,530
- You've gotta stop this.
- No, maybe he's...

30
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,910
It's after him!

31
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,460
- He's in danger. We have to find him! We...
- What exactly was this thing?

32
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,976
It was some kind of animal, you said?

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Uh, no, it was...

34
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,340
It was almost... human,
but it wasn't. It...

35
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,470
It had these long arms and...
it didn't have a face.

36
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,470
It didn't have a face?

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,970
- Joyce.
- It didn't have a face...

38
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,350
Joyce, listen to me.

39
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,890
Listen to me.

40
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,060
After Sarah...

41
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,070
I saw her, too.

42
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,230
And I heard her.

43
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,110
I didn't know what was real.

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,370
And then I figured out
that it was in my mind.

45
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,490
And I had to pack all that away.

46
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,790
Otherwise, I was gonna fall down a hole...

47
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,660
that I couldn't get out of.

48
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,580
No, you're...
you're talking about grief.

49
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,920
This is different.

50
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,470
- I'm just saying that you...
- No, I know what you're saying, Hop.

51
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,760
I swear to you,
I know what I saw.

52
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,100
And I'm not crazy.

53
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,020
I'm not saying that you're crazy.

54
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,020
No...
You are.

55
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,730
And I understand, but...

56
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,230
God, I...

57
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,900
I need you to believe me.

58
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,030
Please.

59
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,990
Please.

60
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,070
Listen...

61
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,450
I think you should go to the morgue
tomorrow and see him for yourself.

62
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,410
It'll give you the answers that you need.

63
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,870
- But tonight...
- Oh, God.

64
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,630
...I want you to try to get some sleep,
if you can.

65
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,000
<i>Byers' body was found
in the water of this quarry</i>

66
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,170
<i>by state police earlier this evening.</i>

67
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,000
<i>It was discovered by state trooper
David O'Bannon, just after dark.</i>

68
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,010
<i>The state police
are mounting an investigation</i>

69
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,970
<i>to determine Byers' cause of death,</i>

70
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,430
<i>but an initial inquiry...</i>

71
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,470
Should I go down and talk to Michael?

72
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,310
Give him time.

73
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,140
He'll come to us when he's ready.

74
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,660
Can you please stop that?

75
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,420
Are you deaf?

76
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,670
I thought we were friends, you know?

77
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,590
But friends tell each other the truth.

78
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,366
And they definitely don't lie
to each other.

79
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,220
You made me think Will was okay,
that he was still out there,

80
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,270
but he wasn't.
He wasn't!

81
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,350
Maybe you thought you were helping,
but you weren't.

82
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,650
You hurt me.
Do you understand?

83
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,980
What you did sucks.

84
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,740
Lucas was right about you.

85
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,740

Will, is that you? It's Mike!
Do you copy?

93
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,230
Over.

94
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,820
Will, are you there?

95
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,780
Will!

96
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,740
Was that...

97
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,870
Was it...

98
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,830
Will.

Mom!

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,170
Mom! Wake up.

102
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,300
What... what time is it?

103
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,050
It's almost 8:00.
We have to go.

104
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,470
Go where? Where?

105
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,720
To see Will.

106
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,810
Michael?

107
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,020
Hi, honey.
How are you feeling?

108
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,690
I, uh...

109
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,650
I don't think I can go to school today.

110
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,450
Oh, that's fine, sweetie.

111
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,780
I need to drop off Nance,
then I'm gonna check in on Barb's parents.

112
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,200
Why don't you grab a book
or something and come with me?

113
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,330
We can stop by the video store
on the way back,

114
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,750
pick out whatever you want.
Even R-rated.

115
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,580
I think I just want to stay home today.

116
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,130
I mean, if that's okay?

117
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,510
Well, are you sure you're gonna be
all right here by yourself?

118
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,050
I think so.

119
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,010
Okay.

120
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,430
But if you need anything,
call Dad at work.

121
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,390
- Okay.
- Okay.

122
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,350
Bye.

123
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,940
Bye, sweetie.

124
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,780
Lucas, do you copy?

125
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,070
<i>Lucas, come on, I know you're there!</i>

126
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,870
This is urgent.
I'm serious.

127
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,290
I'm not gonna stop until you answer.

128
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,790
Lucas.

129
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,330
Lucas!

130
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,210
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas,
Lucas, Lucas...

131
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,590
<i>Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas,
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas...</i>

132
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,130
Go away, Mike.

133
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,220
I'm not in the mood, all right?
Over and out.

134
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,680
<i>No, not "out."</i>

135
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,220
I'm not messing around, okay?
This is about Will.

136
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,220
<i>- Over.</i>
- What about Will?

137
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,720
You mean about his funeral?
Over.

138
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,980
No, not his funeral.

139
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,560
- Screw his funeral!
- What?

140
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,940
Just get over here stat.
And bring Dustin.

141
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,310
Over and out.

142
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,440
What's taking so long?

143
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,620
Well, everything's been a bit chaotic
around here without Gary.

144
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,580
Without Gary?

145
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,750
- Where's Gary?
- Well, I thought you knew.

146
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,210
Those men from State, they...
they sent Gary home last night.

147
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,670
So who did the autopsy?

148
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,840
Someone from State.

149
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,830
He has a birth mark on his right arm.

150
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,620
Can you show that to me, please?

151
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,330
How's your mom doing?

152
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,010
I don't know.

153
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,470
How long's this stuff been going on?
With the lights and, uh...

154
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,760
Will and the thing in the wall?

155
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,730
Since the first phone call, I guess.

156
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,400
You know, she's had anxiety problems...

157
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,690
in the past.

158
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,690
But this...

159
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,410
I don't know.

160
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,200
I'm worried it could be...

161
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,210
Ugh, I don't know.

162
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,090
She'll be okay.

163
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,510
We'll be okay.

164
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,260
My mom...

165
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,980
she's tough.

166
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,560
Yeah, she is.

167
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,480
Hey.

168
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,270
She is.

169
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,490
Ma'am!

170
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,170
- Ma'am, I need you to sign!
- I don't...

171
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,990
I don't know what you think that thing
is in there, but that is not my son!

172
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,830
- Joyce, wait a second.
- No!

173
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,040
- Mom!
- Ma'am, I... Ma'am!

174
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,340
So, wait a sec. I don't understand.
You went back to my house?

175
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,800
To look for Barb.

176
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,970
Yeah, okay, but why didn't you
just talk to me?

177
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,680
That's crazy.

178
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,600
I don't know, I... I was scared.

179
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,310
You seriously think
you saw a guy in a mask

180
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,060
just hanging out in my yard?

181
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,890
I don't think it was a mask.

182
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,770
But he had no face?

183
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,770
I don't know!

184
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,730
I don't know, I just...

185
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,400
I have a terrible feeling about this.

186
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,530
Oh, this is bad.

187
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,160
This is really bad.

188
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,280
What?

189
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,240
The cops...

190
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,080
they're gonna want to talk
to all of us now.

191
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,670
Tommy, Carol,
everybody who was at the party.

192
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,710
- So?
- My parents are gonna murder me!

193
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,750
Are you serious right now?

194
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,920
You don't understand.
My dad's a grade-A asshole.

195
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,510
Barb is missing!
And you're worried about your dad?

196
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,930
Okay, just...
When you talk to the cops, just...

197
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,930
don't mention the beers.

198
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,810
It's just gonna get us both in trouble,

199
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,020
and Barbara's got nothing to do with it,
okay?

200
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,060
I can't believe you right now.

201
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,150
- I can't believe you.
- Nancy.

202
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,150
Nancy, wait!

203
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,070
Nancy!

204
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,096
- Mom, will you get in?
- No, I...

205
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,540
I need to think.
Just go on home.

206
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,580
Mom, will you just get in, please?

207
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,880
Mom.

208
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,710
Mom!

209
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,170
Mom.

210
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,640
- Stop.
- Just go home, Jonathan.

211
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,470
No, this is not an okay time
for you to shut down.

212
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,970
- Shut down? What...
- We have to deal with this, Mom.

213
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,770
We have to deal with the funeral!

214
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,310
The funeral?

215
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,310
- For... for who?
- For that thing back there?

216
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,440
Okay, let me get this straight.

217
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,690
Will, that's not his body,
because he's in the lights, right?

218
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,610
And there's a monster in the wall?

219
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,200
Do you even hear yourself?

220
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,200
I know it sounds crazy.

221
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,620
I sound crazy!

222
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,500
- Yeah.
- You think I don't know that?

223
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,750
It is crazy!

224
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,670
But I heard him, Jonathan.

225
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,420
He talked to me!

226
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,340
Will is... is calling to me!

227
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,300
And he's out there, and he's alone,
and he's scared, and I...

228
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,340
I don't care if anyone believes me!

229
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:30,010
I am not gonna stop looking for him
until I find him and bring him home.

230
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,180
I am going to bring him home!

231
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,060
Yeah, well,
while you're talking to the lights,

232
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,650
the rest of us are having
a funeral for Will!

233
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,780
I'm not letting him sit in that freezer
another day!

234
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,200
All right, show's over.

235
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,240
What?

236
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,340
We keep losing the signal,
but you heard it, right?

237
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,840
Yeah, I heard a baby.

238
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,970
What?

239
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,850
Mike, you obviously tapped
into a baby monitor.

240
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,570
It's probably the Blackburns' next door.

241
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,390
Uh, did that sound like a baby to you?

242
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,770
- That was Will!
- Mike...

243
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,060
Lucas, you don't understand.
He spoke last night.

244
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,360
Words!

245
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,190
He was singing that weird song he loves.
Even El heard him!

246
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,490
Oh, well, if the weirdo heard him,
then I guess...

247
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,886
Are you sure you're on the right channel?

248
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,966
I don't think it's about that.

249
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,660
I think, somehow, she's channeling him.

250
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,410
- Like... like Professor X.
- Yeah.

251
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,160
Are you actually believing this crap?

252
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,120
I don't know, I mean...

253
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,040
Do you remember when Will
fell off his bike and broke his finger?

254
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,340
He sounded a lot like that.

255
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,470
Did you guys not see what I saw?

256
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,800
They pulled Will's body out of the water.

257
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,430
He's dead!

258
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,230
Well, maybe it's his ghost.
Maybe he's haunting us.

259
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,036
- It's not his ghost.
- So how do you know that?

260
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,740
- I just do!
- Then what was in that water?

261
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,900
I don't know!

262
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,190
All I know is Will is alive.

263
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,730
Will is alive!

264
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,150
He's out there somewhere.

265
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,860
All we have to do is find him.

266
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,990
This isn't gonna work.

267
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,960
We need to get El to a stronger radio.

268
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,040
- Mr. Clarke's Heathkit ham shack.
- Yeah.

269
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,170
The Heathkit's at school.

270
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,510
There is no way we're gonna get the weirdo
in there without anyone noticing.

271
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,470
I mean... look at her.

272
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,550
Wow.

273
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,680
- She looks...
- Pretty.

274
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,100
Good.

275
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,480
You look pretty good.

276
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,000
Pretty.

277
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,960
Good.

278
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,840
Clear.

279
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,470
- You boys hear me all right in there?
- Loud and clear, Shepard.

280
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,260
Good luck in there, son.

281
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,330
"The brown current ran swiftly
out of the heart of darkness,

282
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,410
bearing us down towards the sea

283
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,250
with twice the speed
of our upward progress.

284
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,000
And Kurtz's life
was running swiftly, too..."

285
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,550
Nancy Wheeler?

286
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,510
If you'll come with me, please?

287
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,930
This argument
you and Barbara had?

288
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,640
What exactly was it about?

289
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,850
It wasn't really an argument.

290
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,810
Barb just wanted to leave.

291
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,030
I didn't, so, I...

292
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,650
I told her to just go home.

293
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,860
Then what?

294
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,660
Then I went upstairs
to put on some dry clothes.

295
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,620
And the next day, you went back and...

296
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,120
saw a bear, you're thinking?

297
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,840
I don't know what it was, but...

298
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,130
I think...

299
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,220
I think maybe it took Barb.

300
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,590
- You need to check behind Steve's house...
- We did.

301
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,010
There's nothing there.

302
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,770
- There's no sign of a bear.
- And no car.

303
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,020
- What?
- Look.

304
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,350
We figure that Barbara
came back last night

305
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,560
and then she took off,
went somewhere else.

306
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,820
Has she ever talked to you
about running off?

307
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,360
Leaving town, maybe?

308
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,570
No.

309
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,860
No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever.

310
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,320
She wasn't maybe upset about the fact
that you were spending time with this boy?

311
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,620
Uh, Steve Harrington?

312
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,330
What? No!

313
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,580
Maybe she was jealous
because she saw you go up to Steve's room?

314
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,750
It wasn't like that.

315
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,960
Like what?

316
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,920
Steve and me, we're... we're just friends.

317
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,750
We... we just talked.

318
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,880
Now was this before or after
you changed out of your clothes?

319
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,906
So, Gary, tell me
about these troopers that brought in Will.

320
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,140
It was about six of 'em, I'd say.

321
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,480
They're all Staties?

322
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
Yes, sir.

323
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,690
Never seen that many troopers
come with a body before.

324
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,570
They told you that they were gonna
take care of the autopsy, huh?

325
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,570
Yeah. Claimed jurisdiction.
Kicked me out.

326
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,660
Well, it all seemed a bit over the top
to me, considering...

327
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,580
Considering what?

328
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,790
Considering this was Will Byers
and not John F. Kennedy.

329
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,420
- Thanks for stopping by, Gary.
- Sure thing.

330
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,050
<i>...let the people know that, uh,
the troopers are on duty</i>

331
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,680
<i>and you should be safe, because we think
this is just an isolated incident.</i>

332
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,326
<i>State trooper David O'Bannon,
thank you so much for your help.</i>

333
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,390
<i>- Thank you, sir.
- Back to you...</i>

334
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,830
Okay, remember,
if anyone sees us, look sad.

335
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,580
<i>Attention students,</i>

336
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:41,340
<i>there will be an assembly to honor
Will Byers in the gymnasium now.</i>

337
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,260
<i>Do not go to fourth period.</i>

338
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,510
It's locked.

339
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,760
- What?
- Hey, do you think you can open it?

340
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,550
With your powers?

341
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,100
Boys?

342
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,180
Hey.

343
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,770
Assembly's about to start.

344
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,600
We know.
We're just, you know...

345
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,480
Upset.

346
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,916
Yeah, definitely upset.

347
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,400
We need some alone time.

348
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,650
- To cry.
- Yeah, listen...

349
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,990
I get it. I do.

350
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,070
I know how hard this is,
but let's just be there for Will, huh?

351
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,570
And then...

352
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,580
the Heathkit is all yours
for the rest of the day.

353
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,080
What do you say?

354
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,670
I don't believe we've met.
What's your name?

355
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,420
- Eleven...
- Eleanor! She's my, uh...

356
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,590
- Cousin.
- Second cousin.

357
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,880
She's here for Will's funeral.

358
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,220
Ah, well, welcome to Hawkins Middle,
Eleanor.

359
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,340
I wish you were here
under better circumstances.

360
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,470
Thank you.

361
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,140
Uh, where are you from exactly?

362
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,600
Bad place...

363
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,390
- Sweden!
- I have a lot of Swedish family.

364
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,956
- She hates it there.
- Cold!

365
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,560
Subzero.

366
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,110
- Shall we?
- Yep!

367
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,900
<i>At times like these...</i>

368
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,820
it is important that we come together
as a community.

369
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:53,120
We come...

370
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,620
Abort.

371
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,210
We come together to heal...

372
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,840
we come together to grieve...

373
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,880
- You lied to the police!
- I didn't lie!

374
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:11,220
How naive do you think I am?

375
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,430
You and Steve were just talking?

376
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,760
We slept together!

377
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,100
Is that what you want to know?
It doesn't matter!

378
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,520
- It does matter!
- No! It is all bullshit!

379
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,810
It has nothing to do with Barb
and she's missing.

380
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,836
And something terrible
happened to her. I know it.

381
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,780
I know it!

382
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,900
And no one is listening to me!

383
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,530
Sweetie, sweetie, I'm listening.

384
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,320
- I'm listening to you...
- No! You're not!

385
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,410
Nancy... Nancy!

386
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,200
Just leave me alone!

387
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,840
Try him again.

388
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,550
Shepard, come in.
Confirm comm.

389
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,230
Shepard, come in.
Confirm comm.

390
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,650
<i>This is Shepard.
Confirming, over.</i>

391
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,520
Shepard.
Where are you?

392
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,030
Can you describe to us
what it is you see? Over.

393
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,490
<i>I...
I can't make out my location.</i>

394
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,280
<i>It's hard to see.</i>

395
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,080
Shepard? Do you copy?

396
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,330
Shepard?
Can you hear me?

397
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,060
<i>There's something else...
There's something else in here!</i>

398
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,920
Reel him in.

399
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,050
- Reel him back in!
- Get him in.

400
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,510
Come on, come on!
Faster!

401
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,156
<i>There's something else in here!</i>

402
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,220
<i>Pull me out!
Pull me out, pull me out!</i>

403
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,520
<i>Pull me out! Pull me out!</i>

404
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,080
- Shepard, come in. Over.
- Comms are down, sir.

405
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,750
Shepard, come in!
Over.

406
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,120
<i>Will Byers' death
is an unimaginable tragedy.</i>

407
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:08,670
Will was an exceptional student
and a wonderful friend to all of us.

408
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:14,250
It's impossible to express the hole
his loss will leave in our community.

409
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,630
I'd like to introduce you to Sandy Sloane.

410
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,390
She's a local grief counselor
from the church over in Jonesboro.

411
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,100
But before she comes up here,

412
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:27,350
I just want those of you who are having
trouble dealing with this tragic loss...

413
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,600
Look at these fakers.

414
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,496
They probably didn't even know
his name till today.

415
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,150
What?

416
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,940
Who is interested in this?
This is so stupid.

417
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,490
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

418
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,740
Oh,
he was such a great student.

419
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,120
Oh, he's going to leave
a hole in the community.

420
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,790
Mouth breather.

421
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,970
Hey! Hey!

422
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,310
Hey, Troy!

423
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,560
Hey, Troy!

424
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,600
You... you think this is funny?

425
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,100
What'd you say, Wheeler?

426
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,730
I saw you guys
laughing over there.

427
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,940
And I think that's
a real messed up thing to do.

428
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,070
Didn't you listen to the counselor,
Wheeler?

429
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,780
Grief shows itself in funny ways.

430
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,870
Besides, what's there to be
sad about, anyway?

431
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,910
Will's in fairyland now, right?

432
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,960
Flying around
with all the other little fairies.

433
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,540
All happy and gay!

434
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,140
You're dead, Wheeler!

435
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:49,930
Dead!

436
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,650
Dude, Troy peed himself.

437
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,500
Holy shit!

438
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,090
Hey! What's going on here?

439
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,250
Oh.

440
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,420
Mike! Let's go!

441
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:34,480
It's made of soft wood
with a crepe interior.

442
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,980
Uh, now, I...
I don't know what your budget is,

443
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,740
but over here, we...
we have copper and bronze.

444
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,450
Can you just give me a second?

445
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,580
Of course.

446
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,630
Hey.

447
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,420
Hey.

448
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,970
Your mom, um... she said you'd be here.

449
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,590
I just...

450
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,140
Can we talk for a second?

451
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,400
It looks like it could be
some kind of perspective distortion,

452
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,520
but I wasn't using the wide angle.

453
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,150
I don't know.

454
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,440
It's weird.

455
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,160
And you're sure you didn't see
anyone else out there?

456
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,030
No.

457
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,580
And she was there one second
and then, um...

458
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,210
gone.

459
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,920
I figured she bolted.

460
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,340
The cops think that she ran away.

461
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,340
But they don't know Barb.

462
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,010
And I went back to Steve's...

463
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,760
and I thought I...

464
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,640
saw something.

465
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,020
Some...

466
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,270
weird man or...

467
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,770
I don't know what it was.

468
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,150
I'm sorry.

469
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,160
I... I shouldn't have come
here today. I'm...

470
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,080
I'm so sorry.

471
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,540
What'd he look like?

472
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,250
What?

473
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,580
This man you saw in the woods.

474
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,630
What'd he look like?

475
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,630
I don't know.

476
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,430
It was almost like he...

477
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,550
he didn't have...

478
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,470
Didn't have a face?

479
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,560
How did you know that?

480
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,240
Aw, come on!

481
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,660
Another, please.

482
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,710
And another for my, uh, friend here.

483
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,750
Oh, thanks, man.
Appreciate it.

484
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,420
Yeah, that's all right.
I'm, uh... I'm celebrating.

485
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,380
My daughter,
she won the spelling bee today.

486
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,720
Is that right?

487
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,300
Yeah, that's right.

488
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,680
"Odontalgia."

489
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,640
That was the word.

490
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,560
You know what it means?

491
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,100
It's a fancy name for a toothache.

492
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,070
Yeah, she's smart. She's real smart.
Don't know where she gets it from.

493
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,450
I've been tryin'
to figure that out for years.

494
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,240
Your daughter, she got a name?

495
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,120
What?

496
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,750
Your daughter?
What's her name?

497
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,500
Sarah.

498
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,000
Her name's Sarah.

499
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,510
To Sarah.

500
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,690
I recognize you.

501
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,020
Are you famous or somethin'?

502
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,400
Uh, you might have seen me on TV, I, uh...
I found that Byers boy.

503
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,570
So, you on that case or what?

504
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,320
I just saw him on patrol, you know?

505
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,530
Dumb luck.

506
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,410
So that quarry, that's, uh...

507
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,910
that's state-run,
where they found the boy, huh?

508
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,330
Yeah.

509
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,710
Yeah, well, that's funny.

510
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,050
'Cause, you know, I know for a fact
that it's run by the Sattler Company.

511
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:37,970
Frank Sattler? Decent guy, still got
a couple operational quarries up in Roane.

512
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,430
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

513
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,560
That's right.

514
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,810
So why are you lying to me, man?

515
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,230
What's your problem, bud?

516
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,940
I don't have a problem.

517
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,490
I'm just a concerned citizen.

518
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,740
Yeah?

519
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,490
Well, stick your nose someplace else.

520
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,870
The kid is dead.

521
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,120
End of story.

522
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,080
Thanks for ruining the game, dick.

523
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,630
Okay...

524
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,680
Let's try this one more time.

525
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,760
Who told you to be out there?

526
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,600
What were you doing out there?

527
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,100
I don't know!
I don't know. They...

528
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:28,440
they just told me to call it in
and not let anybody get too close.

529
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,150
Get close to what?

530
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,480
The body.

531
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,150
Who do you work for?

532
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,700
The NSA? Hawkins Lab?

533
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,620
Who is that?

534
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,620
- You're gonna get us both killed.
- Who is that?

535
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,080
Hey! Hey!

536
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,680
Come on!
Come on!

537
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,520
Talk to me!

538
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,900
I know you're here!

539
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,780
Come on.

540
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,780
- Now what?
- She'll find him.

541
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:24,990
Right, El?

542
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,130
Eleven?

543
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,760
Are you listening?

544
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,640
That man before you...

545
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,400
I need you to find him.

546
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,150
- Hurt him?
- No.

547
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,820
No, I don't want you to hurt him.

548
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,450
I want you to listen to him.

549
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,830
- Listen?
- Yes.

550
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:17,340
I want you to listen to what he says
and repeat his words back to me.

551
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,930
Just like we used to
with those old nursery rhymes.

552
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,430
Do you remember?

553
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,180
Hmm?

554
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,390
Do you think you can do that for me?

555
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,140
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good.

556
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,080
<i>Begin.</i>

557
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Amulet.

558
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
Frigid.

559
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,880
Evolve.

560
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,050
Airplane.

561
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,300
Eleven?

562
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,050
Repeat the words.

563
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,810
<i>Apricot.</i>

564
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,980

<i>Balloon.</i>

569
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,610
She's doing it.

570
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,410
- She's finding him!
- This is crazy.

571
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,280
Calm down.
She just closed her eyes.

572
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,700
Holy...

573
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,840
What is that?

574
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:57,770
<i>Mom?</i>

575
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,770

<i>Mom?</i>

577
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,650
No way!

578
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,530
- <i>Mom...</i>
- Will!

579
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,660
<i>Please...</i>

580
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,070
Will!

581
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,080
Will!

582
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,200
Will...

00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,660
Will!

- Will!
- Will, it's us! Are you there?

588
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,380
Can you hear us?
We're here!

589
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,470
<i>Hello? Mom?</i>

590
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,590
Why can't he hear us?

591
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,890
I don't know!

592
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,760
Baby...

593
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:34,640
- Mom?
- Oh, God. Will!

594
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:35,730
Mom!

595
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,770
Oh, thank God.

596
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,650
Baby...

597
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,770
Will...

598
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,980
Mom...

599
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,400
Mom, it's coming!

600
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,700
Tell me where you are!
How do I get to you?

601
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,280
<i>It's like home,
but it's so dark...</i>

602
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:53,240
<i>It's so dark and empty.
And it's cold!</i>

603
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,540
<i>Mom? Mom!</i>

604
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,920
Listen to me!
I swear I'm gonna get to you, okay?

605
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,830
But right now, I need you to hide.

606
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,290
Mom, please!

607
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,960
No, no, listen! Listen, I...

608
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,010
I will find you, but you have to run now!

609
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,430
Run! Run!

610
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,650
- El, are you okay?
- Oh!

611
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,710
Can you move?

612
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,130
Here, help her up.

613
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,290
This way!

614
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,260
And you're...

615
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,670
Brightening.
Enlarging.

616
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,880
Hmm.

617
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,010
Did your mom say anything else?

618
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:41,140
Like, um,
where it might have gone to, or...

619
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:44,650
No, just that it came out of the wall.

620
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,100
How long does this take?

621
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,200
Not long.

622
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:00,080
Have you been...

623
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,000
doing this a while?

624
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,670
What?

625
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,000
Photography?

626
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,710
Yeah.

627
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,800
I guess I'd rather observe
people than, you know...

628
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,930
Talk to them.

629
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,970
I know.
It's weird.

630
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,060
No!

631
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,270
No, it is.

632
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,850
It's just, sometimes...

633
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,560
people don't really say
what they're really thinking.

634
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,400
But you capture the right moment...

635
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,650
it says more.

636
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,110
What was I saying?

637
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,740
What?

638
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,120
When you took my picture.

639
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,450
I shouldn't have taken that.

640
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,660
I'm, uh...

641
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,290
I'm sorry.

642
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,670
It's just...

643
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,290
That's it.

644
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,340
That's what I saw.

645
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,800
My mom...

646
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:58,850
I thought she was crazy

647
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:00,680
'cause she said...

648
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,520
that's not Will's body.
That he's alive.

649
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,270
- And if he's alive...
- Then Barbara.

650
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,330
- Hey, Patty!
- Hey, uh, need something, Chief?

651
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,920
- Oh, you know, I forgot my hat.
- Oh.

652
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,710
I'll just be a minute.

653
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,890
Hey, I love that book.
It's a nasty mutt.

654
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,076
Hey, you can't be back here.

655
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,736
Yeah, I just got off the line
with O'Bannon.

656
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,730
He said that he needs
to see you at the station.

657
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,956
- It's some emergency...
- What the hell are you talking about?

658
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,100
I don't work with O'Bannon.

659
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,980
Did I say O'Bannon? I meant...

660
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,980
Okay.

661
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,790
Babe...

662
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,210
Jesus, the hell happened?

663
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,920
Lonnie.
