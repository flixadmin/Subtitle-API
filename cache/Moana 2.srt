00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,541
Almost there, just an easy little hawk.

3
00:01:58,458 --> 00:01:59,458
Kind of.

4
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,375
Hey, you wanted to come this time.

5
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,250
Just a little higher.

6
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,750
Hey, hey, ow.

7
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You hear anything?

8
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,791
I don't like it.

9
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,625
There's gotta be other
people out here, other villages.

10
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:59,250
And one day someone's gonna end certain.

11
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,250
Never change.

12
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:55,625
Hey, hey, sweet beautiful chicken.

13
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,500
What are you waiting for?

14
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's go home.

15
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,791
I can't wait till I retire.

16
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:56,707
You're bruised.

17
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,625
You're in my face.

18
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,291
I don't love anything.

19
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,833
How could I beat this chicken?

20
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,333
New look.

21
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,375
Yep, even better.

22
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,625
Oh, look.

23
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,125
The name is Boo.

24
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,250
Hi, kid.

25
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,250
You can do it.

26
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:19,916
Hold on.

27
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:20,666
Lay it on me.

28
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:23,041
I mean, it takes a
bit to rotate the sails.

29
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:23,750
Got it.

30
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,750
No, no, no, no, no, no.

31
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,999
It's called a hair whip.

32
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,291
A hair whip.

33
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,083
Let it from those guys.

34
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,583
So, how did go this time?

35
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,583
You found something.

36
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,375
It was in a clearing,
which I found a little help from.

37
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,458
Hey, but this isn't from our village.

38
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,875
I don't even know what
it's made of, but it's proof.

39
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,458
There are other people out there.

40
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:58,333
I don't know why we haven't
found them yet, but Dad, that island,

41
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,708
I think that's where they're going to be.

42
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,250
I just have to figure
out how to find those stars.

43
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Little fish!

44
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,041
Little fish!

45
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,958
I thought you were gone forever.

46
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,500
It was three days,
but I missed you every...

47
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,416
Mr. Baby.

48
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,166
Bring you?

49
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,083
You said you'd bring me a present.

50
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:24,875
Hmm.

51
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,833
Well, let me see.

52
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Whoa.

53
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,708
What's it do?

54
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What's it not?

55
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,291
Where are we going?

56
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,083
This is the place of our ancestors,
where I learned our people are voyagers.

57
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,500
Where Grandma showed me who we are.

58
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,457
She said to Grandma
by the ear and tell him,

59
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,416
I am a one and I'm a two-newie.

60
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,083
You'll board my boat and
restore the heart of the fishy.

61
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:06,375
Pretty good.

62
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:07,666
Yeah.

63
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,375
How much did it take?

64
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,166
A few weeks.

65
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:11,708
Weeks?

66
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,000
That's longer than forever.

67
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,666
I know, but it was important.

68
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:22,291
And if I hadn't fallen, I
never would have become a wayfinder.

69
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,625
Like our ancient chiefs, like
the last great navigator, Taotai Busa.

70
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:33,750
Before Maui stole
Timothy's heart and we stopped voyaging,

71
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:40,708
Taotai Busa wanted to connect our island
to all the people of the entire ocean.

72
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:48,166
Because together, what we can
do, how far we all can go, it's endless.

73
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,041
And now that I'm a wayfinder,
it's my job to continue what he started.

74
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:00,416
And this, this is my first cool how.

75
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,500
You should make Maui
go so you can stay with me.

76
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,333
Well, Maui's out
demigodding, but if he ever shows up,

77
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,166
you'll grab him by
the ear and tell him that.

78
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,541
I'm not here to cause trouble, just
a super chiseled demigodd passing through.

79
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:01,125
Now open the portal to
the island and I'll be on my way.

80
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,375
And why would I risk
breaking the rules for you

81
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,416
when you've already
caused my boss so much trouble?

82
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:11,166
Who?

83
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,291
Maui started it.

84
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:13,541
And you'll finish it?

85
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,000
Team up with your precious human again.

86
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,875
Team? You mean the girl with
the canoe and that goofy little chicken?

87
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,625
We weren't a team. I
just used her to get my hook.

88
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:28,333
Ow!

89
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,999
Nalo is a god, Maui.

90
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,041
If you try to reconnect the
people of the ocean, he will destroy you.

91
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,166
And then he'll destroy her too.

92
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,458
This is between him and me.

93
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,083
Moana has nothing to do with it.

94
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,333
Ooh, you've made her a way by now, Maui.

95
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:54,583
So now, she has everything to do with it.

96
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's done!

97
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,999
I'd like a sound like that.

98
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Woo hoot!

99
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:24,375
Here you are.

100
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:37,500
Well, eat up.

101
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,583
We don't want the port getting old.

102
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,000
Why don't you watch me now?

103
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,833
Wanna.

104
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,333
Tonight isn't just a feast.

105
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:51,916
Long ago,

106
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:55,333
there was a title given
to the last great wayfinder.

107
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,541
With dreams as big as yours.

108
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,916
The sacred title.

109
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,458
More than a chief.

110
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,291
A tall tide.

111
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Leader.

112
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,833
Connector of the entire sea.

113
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,500
My dear.

114
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,750
Would you honor us
tonight by accepting this title?

115
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,916
How people's first
tall tide in a thousand years.

116
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,040
And show us all

117
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,791
just how far we'll go.

118
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:46,291
Tonight, we drink
from our ancestors' form.

119
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,916
As tall tide us all once did.

120
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,083
To bestow this title.

121
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
On you.

122
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,208
To connect to our past.

123
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:56,708
Our present.

124
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,416
And the future that lies beyond.

125
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:04,000
May the ancestors continue to guide us.

126
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:18,708
I am
honored to serve our people.

127
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,625
May the ancestors continue to guide us.

128
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,833
One truth may too be ...

129
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,041
...under the stars.

130
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,958
S

131
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,291
You are my people.

132
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,166
So type one.

133
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:51,916
This is your future
if you cannot find others.

134
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:57,125
In isolation, this
is how your story ends.

135
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,708
I don't understand.

136
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,291
Returning to
Hichi's heart was the beginning.

137
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,708
You must brave the storm.

138
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,791
Reconnect our people.

139
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,166
Find Mochufetsu.

140
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,958
I don't know how to reach it.

141
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:15,040
A fire in the sky will guide you.

142
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,916
Wait, I don't even know how far it is.

143
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,166
Farther than I was able to go.

144
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,833
Find Mochufetsu.

145
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,458
Reconnect us all.

146
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,375
Mochufetsu.

147
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,458
The island I have to find is Mochufetsu.

148
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,041
Okay.

149
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,083
Took some searching, but...

150
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,166
Mochufetsu.

151
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What is it?

152
00:16:55,666 --> 00:17:01,166
An ancient island where the
channels of the ocean once came together,

153
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,666
connecting the people of the
entire sea until it was lost, cursed.

154
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:17,291
In a terrible storm
of a power-hungry god, novel.

155
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,958
He believed he'd be stronger by separating
the people of the ocean to weaken us,

156
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,458
to end our story.

157
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:36,583
Our ancestors believed reaching
Mochufetsu would break Nalo's curse,

158
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,416
restore the channels.

159
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:44,083
It's the only way to
bring our people together again.

160
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:46,833
Or historians.

161
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,125
We need to convene a council of people.

162
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,208
Fire in the sky.

163
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,750
He wants me to follow it.

164
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,541
Two new stars.

165
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,791
It could take a lifetime.

166
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,791
Don't dive us. I
didn't make it back at all.

167
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,208
It's a call from the ancestors to him.

168
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,416
But if we never see her again...

169
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,500
I do mean everything you want to get.

170
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,166
Sami... No, I mean that's...

171
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,500
I don't want you to leave.

172
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,125
Mom, it's...

173
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,583
It's so fast. What if...

174
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,833
You're a tough time now, Moana.

175
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,458
For some things...

176
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,458
We never feel ready.

177
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,583
My mom.

178
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:04,125
I'll always be right beside you.

179
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:08,625
But perhaps you're meant for more.

180
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,500
Oh, what are you so worried about?

181
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,916
It's not like last time.

182
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,958
Last time you
weren't old enough to understand.

183
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,000
Oh, you could lose or learn.

184
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:29,333
And here we are together
still just a little different.

185
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,666
I can't see where your story leads.

186
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,166
But we never stop choosing who we are.

187
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,250
This is bigger than what you do.

188
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,083
Bigger than us.

189
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,666
So I will sail into this new sky to
reconnect the people of the entire ocean.

190
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:58,416
And then I will return home.

191
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,458
Moana, you need a crew.

192
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,660
Hey, hey, Apuwa, don't count.

193
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,916
It's the other side of the ocean.

194
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:50,665
How could I ask them to?

195
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:54,750
Our people will rise if you let them.

196
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,625
Last time the chicken made it.

197
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,833
Well, I'm going to need a bigger canal.

198
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,124
Yes, brand new.

199
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:06,333
Sleep.

200
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:07,291
Double health design.

201
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:08,625
My fist can do this.

202
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:09,375
Sweet.

203
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,999
I'm hoping to line
up greats with the crew.

204
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,958
I'd like you on the crew.

205
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,125
Well, we should do better than this.

206
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,790
A farmer on the sea.

207
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,431
We're going to
need to eat more than fish.

208
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You need irrigation.

209
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:28,666
Plant propagation.

210
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,625
Take even my best apprentice.

211
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,041
Good stuff.

212
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:32,916
Exactly.

213
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,000
We need a master.

214
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,333
Yes, you too.

215
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:36,583
Thanks, Kelly.

216
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:37,416
You're the best.

217
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,416
I walked onto that one.

218
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,875
Hey, Maui, it's been a while.

219
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:48,291
I don't know where you are,
but I could really use your help.

220
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,750
Maui!

221
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,458
Oh, Moni.

222
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,625
It's both of us, actually.

223
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,083
Maui and me.

224
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,291
It's part of a series.

225
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,125
Wow.

226
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,541
It's too bad Maui isn't here.

227
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:08,871
We really need someone
who knows all the old stories.

228
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:14,333
Someone who's like super
strong and has great hair and just...

229
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:16,332
I know someone else.

230
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,333
Kind of like that?

231
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:19,708
Yes!

232
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,625
I'm going with Donna
on a call from the ancestors.

233
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:25,416
Whoo!

234
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,291
Get ready for some
eyewitness accounts, people.

235
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,916
I'm coming with you.

236
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:45,041
I'll be back as soon as I can.

237
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:46,875
I promise.

238
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,458
What if you don't come back?

239
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:01,791
The ocean is my friend.

240
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:12,833
Our friend.

241
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,208
He connects us.

242
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:47,291
So, there is nowhere I could
ever go that I won't be with you.

243
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:48,625
Go.

244
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:58,083
So you can take a piece of hold.

245
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,500
Okay, okay, okay.

246
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
One more time.

247
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:36,541
This is not the end of our story.

248
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:40,583
This is not where our destiny is denied.

249
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,666
Together, we rise as one.

250
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:47,166
Together, we take our freedom.

251
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,374
That guy gets it.

252
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:55,833
Yep, I made you handsome.

253
00:28:56,916 --> 00:29:00,250
Now all you gotta do is catch my hook.

254
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:02,833
Come on.

255
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,208
Yes, yes.

256
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:07,458
Come on, you got it.

257
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:08,866
That's what I'm talking about.

258
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,500
Yes, keep doing it.

259
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
That's it, higher.

260
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:12,583
We're almost there.

261
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:13,916
Just a little higher.

262
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,208
Don't worry.

263
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:34,466
Come on, you know
me, I'll get us out of here.

264
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:38,125
No, I don't need her to save me.

265
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:39,916
Again.

266
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:42,208
Because she'll die.

267
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:45,166
Melo hates humans
even more than he hates me.

268
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:46,642
And let me tell you something.

269
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:47,666
He hates me a lot.

270
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:51,000
So the farther Curly is
from any of this, the better.

271
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:54,833
We're on our own.

272
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:57,958
Yeah, I got it.

273
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,541
I would let you out, but I'm
really hoping to meet your little friend.

274
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:07,541
I have plans for you both.

275
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,708
Hey, hey, hey, enjoy your lunch.

276
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,500
Melo, what are you doing?

277
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:38,000
I'm making improvements.

278
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:39,125
Okay.

279
00:30:39,126 --> 00:30:42,708
Who is perfect as it is?

280
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:44,083
The fictions of it.

281
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:47,083
There is only
failing, then learning, then death.

282
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:51,666
What is the order?

283
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:53,041
Of course.

284
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:55,000
That's why you're the wayfinder.

285
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:57,708
No, no, no.

286
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,208
Guys, the entire
ocean is kind of counting on us.

287
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:06,000
We've got to rise to the moment.

288
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:09,750
Stay on course and
kick everyone off the canoe.

289
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:12,208
Wait, where's the harbor?

290
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Ow.

291
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,041
When will the canoe stop?

292
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:17,458
Moving.

293
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,791
Well, we're kind of on the ocean.

294
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:22,082
Oh, Moni.

295
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,000
Lotto, Moni's the other one.

296
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,833
Guys, we'll never make it.

297
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,166
What?

298
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:30,583
If you don't embrace the ocean.

299
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:31,934
He kind of breaks the liquid.

300
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:32,999
Otto, I cannot swim.

301
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,375
You don't use a human.

302
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,040
Now everyone looks sad.

303
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:41,999
And whoever designs
the canoe, forgot our macros.

304
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,041
Yes, sir.

305
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,291
I am unclear as to what you are doing.

306
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:56,125
Guys, we want to reach
Motufetu, break Nalo's curse.

307
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,041
We've got to come together.

308
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,958
Find our friends.

309
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:01,833
I don't use anyone.

310
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,791
Oh, we'll see in the back.

311
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:05,958
Don't be dead on your feet.

312
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,958
It's time to live your own story.

313
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,500
Even if you disagree.

314
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:13,333
Try this mandatory look of trials.

315
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,500
What could be better than this?

316
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:17,165
It would be better than this.

317
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:18,625
I'm sure it could be so great.

318
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,458
Why, you just need your son.

319
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:22,375
You can't live here forever.

320
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:24,041
But it was all the fun.

321
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:27,125
Don't you know it's
gathers better than you see?

322
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,999
Nothing is better than this.

323
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,583
I'm going to be sick.

324
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,750
Fascinating. It's like an acid.

325
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:37,000
Can I get a chihu?

326
00:45:38,666 --> 00:45:40,000
Oh, yeah!

327
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:45,041
Now I just gotta get my baby.

328
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,999
The tattoo, Mommy.

329
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,208
Listen to me. I am a demi-god.

330
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,833
I want to be slept by the tattoo.

331
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:09,125
Hey! Okay. Rule number one.

332
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:11,666
Okay.

333
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:16,291
Roll me back. I'll
roll you back. Not him.

334
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:20,416
This is what happens
when you meet your heroes.

335
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:22,583
I know, right?

336
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:28,000
Rule number one.
You never saw me like this.

337
00:46:28,416 --> 00:46:31,625
Even though I still look very
cool. You look like a kidney stone.

338
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,999
You look like someone
who would know what that is.

339
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Now.

340
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,249
Well, hello, bacon.
Okay. I feel like there's

341
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,583
some back story that
I need to get caught up on.

342
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:48,458
Actually, you know what? Scratch that.
I don't want to get attached if you all...

343
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:52,083
You know what?
Which... which... you guys won't.

344
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:54,374
You're not gonna do that. I
don't even know why I said that.

345
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:57,375
The point is, there's
some serious god stuff going down.

346
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,250
So I'm gonna go handle my disc.

347
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:11,125
Alright. Be back in a bit.
Until then, stay alive. Talk to no one.

348
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:20,375
And if you see a crazy
bat lady, run. She is the worst.

349
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:22,875
Stay away or you will die. Be good.

350
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:24,458
Maui, out.

351
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,791
Boat snack. Boat snack.

352
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:32,416
Where's Moana?

353
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,250
Simia? Simia!

354
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:45,416
How are you here?

355
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:51,999
I'm not. You got sucked inside
a giant, um, and her story will end.

356
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,791
Cause now you will never
help the people of the ocean.

357
00:47:56,208 --> 00:48:00,625
And their ancestors will be
like, "Moana, we hate you forever."

358
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,583
You got this.

359
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,916
Here. You got this. You got this.

360
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:35,708
Relax. I don't bite.

361
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:37,583
Here come I.

362
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,833
It's been a while
since I've seen a wayfinder.

363
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,791
Love the oar. Would
you like to see me use it?

364
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:50,000
Ooh, feisty. We
have that in common, Moana.

365
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:54,875
The human who's got all the gods talking.

366
00:48:57,458 --> 00:49:02,541
Who are you, Matani?
Guardian of this little slice of paradise.

367
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:07,000
You live here?

368
00:49:07,333 --> 00:49:11,000
No, by choice. Maui never mentioned me.

369
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:13,999
Probably too busy
playing with his tattoo.

370
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,916
Well, come on then.

371
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,833
Um, I'm not going anywhere with you.

372
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:26,541
Get out of here, break
Nala's curse, find Motufetsu.

373
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:30,791
Here to help. You
know the way to Motufetsu?

374
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,875
You think you can only
get somewhere if you know the way?

375
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,833
That's kind of what wave-biting is.

376
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So much to learn.

377
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,500
A true wayfinder
doesn't know the path at all.

378
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:52,541
That's the whole point. To find
your way to what's never been found.

379
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:57,500
If you want to break Nala's curse,
you've got to stop playing and save Sis.

380
00:49:57,875 --> 00:49:58,875
Get a little lost.

381
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:02,291
Why would I listen to anything you say?

382
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,708
Because Nala trapped me too.

383
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:11,958
I want you to beat
Nala. Because then, I'll be free.

384
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,875
There's always another
way to get where you need to go.

385
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:47,875
You just have to
think a little different.

386
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Different?

387
00:50:50,791 --> 00:50:51,791
Play it right?

388
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,375
Let him save you, then I
know the rules around the bridge.

389
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:14,916
It's time to get lost.

390
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:18,541
He's terribly nice.

391
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:21,166
You know you're questioning.

392
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,125
Take a look around.

393
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:29,041
I've got to let you up and
down, cause at the end you cannot drown.

394
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:31,416
In the rain for memories.

395
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:33,999
It's been too late to see.

396
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,708
And put your trust in me,
because you've got potential and trouble.

397
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,250
The distance are real
existential and lost through existence.

398
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,666
And there is no map beyond estimation.

399
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:50,500
No explanation,
please hold this equation.

400
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:58,999
We're gonna get back,
come loose, and lose our way.

401
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,833
There ain't no
time in holding that faith.

402
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:06,208
You better not try the
thrill of living dangerously.

403
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,583
You've got along a way to go keep crazy.

404
00:52:09,875 --> 00:52:14,208
You'll never know
the rules around the bridge.

405
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:15,875
What is this?

406
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:20,875
Don't you know how good you have it?

407
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:24,375
You're all there stopping you.

408
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,958
You want me, I'm stuck like static.

409
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:29,375
Can you imagine?

410
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:32,250
That life is time to carry the nerve.

411
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:35,500
You've got a chance, don't take it.

412
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:39,208
I know you're scared, but life's unfair.

413
00:52:39,708 --> 00:52:43,416
It's the truth of
choices making it small.

414
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:48,166
Trust the fall, and you can have it all.

415
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,208
You gotta come loose and lose your way.

416
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:56,916
There ain't no
time in holding that faith.

417
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:59,791
You better not try the
thrill of living dangerously.

418
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:03,166
You've got along a way to go keep crazy.

419
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:07,583
You'll never know
the rules around the bridge.

420
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
What is this?

421
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:14,791
What is this?

422
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
You're all there.

423
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
There's always another way in my life.

424
00:53:20,708 --> 00:53:21,708
What are you doing to me?

425
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:26,208
You're all there.

426
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:48,500
Oh, yeah.

427
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,625
There's always another way.

428
00:53:58,375 --> 00:53:59,375
Order of the guards.

429
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:03,083
One get you all the way to Motufi 2,

430
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:05,958
a little short on the
commute for you and your crew.

431
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:08,291
And Mr. Coconut Oil.

432
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,125
Who's Mr. Coconut Oil?

433
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,500
I've always used my patience.

434
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:17,500
Do not fear. You have been rescued.

435
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:21,208
Kwa-ki-na, kwa-ki-na!

436
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:23,833
We're home, we're home!

437
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:25,666
Please!

438
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,583
She's opening.

439
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:49,374
They're such a plan.

440
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:52,332
They keep you in a snack game
because you want us to go together?"

441
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:55,208
Well, I certainly did not
keep you for the conversation.

442
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:56,833
Oh, wait.

443
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,875
Well, shall we?

444
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:05,083
Do you... can't leave?

445
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:07,291
Break Nalo's curse.

446
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,833
And maybe one day
we'll see each other again

447
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:14,958
Remember there's always another way

448
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:18,541
Even if you have to get lost to find it

449
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,625
Good luck. Hold by one

450
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:26,790
You got this

451
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:33,708
Let Nalo find out I
helped will die by lightning

452
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:34,875
Huh?

453
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,291
Molly looks good

454
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:43,375
Woah! I'm kissing the pig!

455
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:46,458
We're in a portal of the gods!

456
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:47,250
Hey!

457
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:48,958
Hey guys!

458
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:50,416
I got her again!

459
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:51,708
Plus Molly?

460
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:52,875
Where's Molly?

461
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:54,208
What's up girlie?

462
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:55,458
Molly!

463
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,583
You could have told
me we were doing new outfits

464
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:01,833
But Rocket leaves on
my cheeks for a thousand years

465
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:03,750
Oh! I can't believe we're here!

466
00:56:04,208 --> 00:56:05,666
Hey buddy, I missed ya!

467
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:09,749
Oh! Sorry, that was weird

468
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:10,750
Is that weird?

469
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:13,125
This is the craziest thing in my life

470
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:17,582
Love this guy! Not creeping me out at all

471
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:18,750
Gotta join me for a second

472
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:21,625
This is cool!

473
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:23,124
Oh! And did you meet the papa mora?

474
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:24,290
I thought he'd do this in a climb

475
00:56:24,291 --> 00:56:25,749
But it turned out to be super great

476
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:28,415
Because otherwise I
never would have met Montagny

477
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:29,083
Who's great by the way

478
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:29,833
And now you!

479
00:56:29,875 --> 00:56:31,875
And now we're gonna
bring all of us together

480
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,333
Sorry, you go

481
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:36,458
You're all gonna die

482
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:39,833
What?

483
00:56:40,916 --> 00:56:41,083
What?

484
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:43,708
Nalo didn't just hide Motofetu in a storm

485
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:45,999
He hid it in a monster storm

486
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,207
In a cursed ocean you can't escape from

487
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:50,708
And then sunk into the bottom of the sea

488
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:53,290
Which means a human can't reach it

489
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:54,999
So unless I break the curse

490
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,124
You just bought a
one way ticket to Densville

491
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:58,832
Which is why I didn't want
you coming out in the first place

492
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:01,957
Because now you're
stuck and you're gonna die

493
00:57:01,958 --> 00:57:03,249
Your crew's gonna die

494
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,208
And this time so is the chicken

495
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:15,040
But it's great to see you

496
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,833
And we're here

497
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:29,833
And we?

498
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,666
But this place looks perfectly nice

499
00:57:35,833 --> 00:57:36,833
And look!

500
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:38,416
A constellation!

501
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:40,125
It's right there!

502
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:45,207
Guys, the ancestors wouldn't have called

503
00:57:45,208 --> 00:57:46,708
If we couldn't do this

504
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:48,000
Unless it was a bot dial

505
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:50,500
That'll make sense in two thousand years

506
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:52,790
Tell Tybaza said reaching Motofetu

507
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:55,749
Is the only way to
give our people a future

508
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:56,791
If you know so much

509
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:59,000
How come he didn't tell you it was f♪♪♪

510
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:00,333
Suck

511
00:58:00,833 --> 00:58:04,666
Because he told me to
follow the fire in the sky

512
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:06,708
That led me straight to you

513
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:08,625
Which makes sense

514
00:58:08,833 --> 00:58:12,750
Because if Nalo thinks he's
stronger by keeping people apart

515
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:16,583
Then maybe the way to
break his curse is by coming together

516
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:20,333
You lift the island and I step on it

517
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:21,666
Mommy and Moana!

518
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:22,791
You're doing it again

519
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:23,833
You're so amazing

520
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:25,541
This is gonna work

521
00:58:25,833 --> 00:58:26,916
Right? Ocean?

522
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Ocean?

523
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:37,541
Moana,

524
00:58:38,166 --> 00:58:39,166
The ocean

525
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:42,416
Cannot help you here

526
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:49,250
Grandma!

527
00:58:50,833 --> 00:58:52,083
Actually,

528
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,833
I believe that's a welcome gift

529
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:57,791
From Nalo

530
00:58:57,792 --> 00:59:05,792
Take that, sucka!

531
00:59:19,833 --> 00:59:22,833
Humans, get your positions,
work together, and let's do this!

532
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:28,583
We really gotta talk
about your quitting process

533
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,000
Rabs!

534
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:32,250
Down below

535
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:34,166
Hate these guys

536
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:35,957
I'm an elder

537
00:59:35,958 --> 00:59:37,416
And I'm three thousand years old

538
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:39,500
Which makes me elder, Earl

539
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:42,832
Just gotta outrun them till sunrise

540
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:44,500
Oh, I didn't open up

541
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:45,874
Uh, sure

542
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:50,833
Oh, yeah!

543
00:59:56,833 --> 00:59:57,916
Woohoo!

544
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:01,041
Did he just freak out?

545
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:06,041
Behind us!

546
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:10,625
If Moana becomes turned
that time to this title, it'll work!

547
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:14,833
Oh, no!

548
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:18,833
Wait!

549
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:22,833
Woah!

550
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:24,833
Wait!

551
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:28,625
Woah!

552
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:29,916
Hey, what?

553
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:32,083
What?

554
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:34,458
No!

555
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,166
Moana!

556
01:00:51,208 --> 01:00:55,458
Moana!

557
01:00:55,833 --> 01:01:03,833
Moana! Moana!

558
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:30,000
Well, figure this out

559
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:32,416
Yeah, sister Moana

560
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:43,790
Don't tell Fazza's!

561
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:44,791
I know!

562
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:52,250
Uh, uh, uh, it's a
bad time to say I told you so

563
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:55,353
So I'm not gonna do that,
because that would make you feel worse

564
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:57,290
But I believe in you

565
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:58,415
No one else does

566
01:01:58,416 --> 01:02:00,499
There you go, walk it off, camp

567
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,791
What? I must be nice!

568
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,708
Ow! No purple, no purple, stop!

569
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:07,500
Okay, I'll talk to her

570
01:02:14,541 --> 01:02:18,083
I know, Maui, it's just...

571
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:27,958
Every time I think I know what
I'm supposed to do, everything changes

572
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:30,291
I can't...

573
01:02:31,291 --> 01:02:32,291
Moana almost died!

574
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:39,541
If I'm the reason her
people's story just... ends...

575
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:44,583
This is serious!

576
01:02:44,958 --> 01:02:46,250
Is something distracting you?

577
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:48,540
Maybe breaking the curses like you said

578
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:49,832
We gotta work together

579
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:53,958
I pull it from the sea, but
a human has to land on its shores

580
01:02:56,833 --> 01:02:59,832
Look, I get it

581
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:01,249
No one else can do this Look, I get it

582
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:03,333
No one likes sucking at their job

583
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:05,541
Why are you even here?

584
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,166
Because... because I've been low before

585
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:15,500
And I couldn't see a way forward

586
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:18,791
And then someone came along

587
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:21,125
Someone who I underestimated

588
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:24,541
And she lifted me up

589
01:03:26,833 --> 01:03:28,833
I haven't done anything right

590
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:31,166
Since I left behind that topic

591
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:35,333
Hey, there is a way out

592
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:39,250
You wanna get through
it? You just gotta... gee who it?

593
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,124
You are so bad at this

594
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:42,790
I'm the best at this

595
01:03:42,791 --> 01:03:46,375
I was a human, but now I'm a demigod

596
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:48,874
You never know what's next

597
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:51,916
I do all those monstrous form?

598
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:53,540
Well, you wanna get through it?

599
01:03:53,541 --> 01:03:54,541
Stop trying

600
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:56,791
You're down in the dumps

601
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:58,291
You think you're way off your game

602
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:01,416
Come on, come on, remember your name

603
01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:03,124
Don't waste all this energy

604
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:06,291
You got the
remedy, and I know your legacy

605
01:04:06,833 --> 01:04:08,957
You got greatness inside

606
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:10,415
And you just gotta believe

607
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:11,915
You think you don't have the tricks

608
01:04:11,916 --> 01:04:13,499
But they're right up your sleeve

609
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,165
These waters are frightening

610
01:04:15,166 --> 01:04:16,707
But you bring the reckoning

611
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:19,249
So drop all the fear and the questioning

612
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:21,207
I need a... can I get a...

613
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:24,082
Who are you? Who are you?

614
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:25,666
Who are you gonna be?

615
01:04:25,958 --> 01:04:27,198
You're gonna... you're gonna...

616
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:28,583
You need the history

617
01:04:28,584 --> 01:04:30,666
You're gonna... you're gonna...

618
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:33,875
Who are you? Who are you?

619
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,249
You gotta... you're gonna...

620
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,750
You need the level up

621
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:39,207
For sure, for sure

622
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,790
You're gonna be nuts and nuts

623
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:42,125
You're gonna... you're gonna...

624
01:04:43,833 --> 01:04:45,499
You're gonna... you're gonna...

625
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,500
You're gonna be...

626
01:04:47,541 --> 01:04:52,040
You used to be
that bullying, storm cause,

627
01:04:52,041 --> 01:04:53,082
conflicting for real

628
01:04:53,083 --> 01:04:55,832
Can you imagine the
legend is at this point for reals?

629
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:57,999
You think that it's doomsday

630
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,374
It's a Tuesday

631
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:01,582
You know what, I'm
coming to play, come to play

632
01:05:01,583 --> 01:05:04,166
And you click right
there for you and I'm trapped

633
01:05:04,833 --> 01:05:06,207
And I'm gonna impress you and cut you up

634
01:05:06,208 --> 01:05:07,415
You're gonna come and be a legend

635
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:10,999
It's a whole lot of becoming a friend

636
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,582
But now you got me invested

637
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:14,291
I'm gonna use that I call a blessing

638
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:18,957
Who are you? Who are you?

639
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:20,250
Who are you gonna be?

640
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,791
You're gonna... you're gonna...

641
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,250
I'm gonna make some ass do it

642
01:05:23,875 --> 01:05:26,332
You're gonna fall
on a focus and then spin me

643
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:29,333
Pull it up, pull it up

644
01:05:34,833 --> 01:05:38,290
It's my turn to
give a motivational speech

645
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:41,249
It's your job to
finally practice what you preach

646
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:43,082
Because of you, a better me

647
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:45,749
I didn't even
think that was a possibility

648
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:48,082
You copy that a mess after mess

649
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:50,999
Then he got into stress,
but now they're also reversed

650
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,500
You're being put to the desk

651
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:56,124
And breaking the curves,
leaving the law, that's gonna be worse

652
01:05:56,125 --> 01:05:57,749
I'm making the bet
on the breakers and breakers

653
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:03,166
I've ever met

654
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,915
I'm gonna make some ass do it

655
01:06:08,916 --> 01:06:09,541
Who are you? Who are you?

656
01:06:09,541 --> 01:06:09,666
Who are you?

657
01:06:09,667 --> 01:06:11,500
I'm gonna make some ass do it

658
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:14,583
You're gonna fall
on a focus and then spin me

659
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:16,083
Pull it up, pull it up

660
01:06:16,833 --> 01:06:19,125
You're gonna... you're gonna...

661
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:20,624
I'm gonna make some ass do it

662
01:06:20,625 --> 01:06:22,833
You're gonna fall
on a focus and then spin me

663
01:06:23,875 --> 01:06:25,207
Pull it up, pull it up

664
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:26,665
Go get your ass do it

665
01:06:26,666 --> 01:06:28,082
Come here

666
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:30,874
Pull it up, pull it up

667
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:32,749
You're gonna fall on your desk do it

668
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:34,457
You're gonna have to get free up

669
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:37,332
Pull it up, pull it up

670
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:38,957
Go find your desk do it

671
01:06:38,958 --> 01:06:39,500
Come here

672
01:06:39,501 --> 01:06:44,457
Pull it up

673
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:49,207
Go get him princess

674
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:50,625
Still not a princess

675
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:52,873
What do you think you are?

676
01:06:55,833 --> 01:07:02,041
I know what I've asked you is a lot

677
01:07:02,833 --> 01:07:06,000
That our canoe is in really rough shape

678
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:10,833
But I believe that together we...

679
01:07:31,125 --> 01:07:33,500
We found a way to fix it

680
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:35,582
A little help from the ancestors, man

681
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:37,582
I did the decorations

682
01:07:37,583 --> 01:07:39,957
We used the chicken

683
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:41,874
Respect

684
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:49,249
Nala wants to end our story

685
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:49,791
But we're not letting that happen

686
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:49,831
We're not letting that happen

687
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:51,809
We're not letting that happen We're not letting that happen We're not letting
that happen We're not letting that happen But we're not letting that happen

688
01:07:51,833 --> 01:07:53,583
We just have to outsmart him

689
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:55,915
Find some new
traits he's never seen before

690
01:07:55,916 --> 01:07:59,666
Well, I have been working on some ideas

691
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:02,250
Also, we do have a demigod

692
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:04,290
Sure, he's a little scruffy

693
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:05,915
But I get out better than nothing

694
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:07,082
I think you'll agree

695
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,916
Okay, we sail to
the heart of Nala's storm

696
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:16,166
Once I raise the
island, you all have to get to it

697
01:08:16,916 --> 01:08:18,833
It would be harder
than anything we faced before

698
01:08:19,875 --> 01:08:20,916
So if anyone wants to...

699
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:29,958
I spent my whole life
learning our people's stories

700
01:08:30,833 --> 01:08:35,708
Because of you, I get to live for it

701
01:08:37,541 --> 01:08:38,541
Alright then

702
01:08:38,833 --> 01:08:41,208
Let's break a curse

703
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:48,833
Yeah, been a while since
I pulled an island from the sea

704
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:52,153
I know I have to bend it to knees

705
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:54,374
I have great posture

706
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:58,791
You know what? You farted

707
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:02,957
He's growing on me

708
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:04,041
Like a witch

709
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:05,500
That's beautiful

710
01:09:05,501 --> 01:09:07,000
Okay, we do this

711
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:09,583
We make it home

712
01:09:10,875 --> 01:09:12,499
Curly

713
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:18,833
Is this work?

714
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:21,208
I'm doing it one

715
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:41,166
Well, now I kind
of miss a lot of monsters

716
01:09:46,833 --> 01:09:48,500
Ah, it's a big wave

717
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:53,415
We can go around it

718
01:09:53,416 --> 01:09:54,915
Everyone get to your position

719
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:57,666
Be ready to switch it up

720
01:09:57,833 --> 01:09:59,541
Here, it's fucked up

721
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:01,458
You might want to check the sundial

722
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:02,958
Why? What time is it?

723
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:04,833
It's bowie time

724
01:10:05,833 --> 01:10:10,250
Let's lift an island and
show the swing back who's boss

725
01:10:10,833 --> 01:10:12,457
Bring the thunder

726
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:17,833
I mean it's got a foot right?

727
01:10:19,833 --> 01:10:27,833
Yeah

728
01:10:33,666 --> 01:10:34,041
Switch it up

729
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:34,958
We're going over

730
01:10:34,959 --> 01:10:36,624
Hold on, I don't want it

731
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:44,625
Help me

732
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:48,833
Hello

733
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:52,458
Hello

734
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:54,416
What about this?

735
01:10:55,416 --> 01:10:58,499
I'm going to pull the finger

736
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:02,332
Hold on

737
01:11:02,333 --> 01:11:03,333
There

738
01:11:05,833 --> 01:11:09,040
Let's do it

739
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:13,541
Oh, come on

740
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:17,332
They keep coming across

741
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:18,333
We got to turn

742
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:23,250
Hold on

743
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:27,749
Get up Get up

744
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,707
Help me

745
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:34,915
Help me

746
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:37,499
Hold me

747
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,915
It's okay, I got a half of them

748
01:11:39,916 --> 01:11:40,916
More board

749
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:44,750
Oh, I'm going to throw this thing

750
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,458
I'm going to throw this thing

751
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:49,790
Well, now it's a cheater

752
01:11:49,791 --> 01:11:53,458
I am the coward for avoiding

753
01:11:54,333 --> 01:11:55,125
You know

754
01:11:55,126 --> 01:11:58,082
He doesn't care about you

755
01:11:58,083 --> 01:11:59,750
Oh, he cares about me

756
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:00,957
I'm saying

757
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:04,250
It's humans, he wants to stop us

758
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:06,541
Why are you smiling?

759
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:08,416
Because we can use it

760
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:10,353
Distract all of, let him come after us

761
01:12:10,833 --> 01:12:13,915
While Maui reaches the
center and lifts the island

762
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:15,249
We switch it up

763
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:18,541
Okay, Curly, you
couldn't outmaneuver the storm before

764
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:20,073
How are you going to do it now?

765
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:22,000
I think I am digging it out

766
01:12:22,833 --> 01:12:25,208
I will need to chuck the glass

767
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:31,500
If you keep coming back to
help us, we'll never break Nolo's curse

768
01:12:32,833 --> 01:12:35,208
We can draw the storm Maui

769
01:12:35,833 --> 01:12:36,833
It's the only way

770
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:46,082
I'm going to throw this thing

771
01:12:46,083 --> 01:12:47,499
I'm going to throw this thing I'm going
to throw this thing Go as fast as you can

772
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:51,915
Uh, look, I could
pull up a million islands

773
01:12:51,916 --> 01:12:54,666
But if you're not
there to land on them, then

774
01:12:58,833 --> 01:12:59,958
See you up there, Maui

775
01:13:01,833 --> 01:13:03,166
See how they're Moana

776
01:13:06,041 --> 01:13:07,041
Bacon? Eggs?

777
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:10,833
Yeah

778
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:13,833
Giant Hawk

779
01:13:16,916 --> 01:13:17,750
So serious

780
01:13:17,751 --> 01:13:22,000
See you on the island

781
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:37,791
The Spedy thing is coming

782
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,416
Stop placing the protons like this

783
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:46,749
Pickle

784
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:54,750
You can see it!

785
01:13:57,208 --> 01:13:59,333
I couldn't have done it without Maui

786
01:15:09,833 --> 01:15:14,458
A little dizzy!

787
01:15:14,708 --> 01:15:16,750
Lightening and windows...

788
01:15:17,083 --> 01:15:18,415
solemnizing

789
01:15:18,416 --> 01:15:23,583
We have been gone.

790
01:15:23,958 --> 01:15:26,958
You're ready!!!

791
01:15:28,583 --> 01:15:32,708
I can't talk again.

792
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:35,083
I'm fine...

793
01:15:36,125 --> 01:15:37,125
What happened?

794
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:39,833
Are we worse?
