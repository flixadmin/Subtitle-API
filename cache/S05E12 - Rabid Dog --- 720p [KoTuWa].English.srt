1
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,520
Jesse?

2
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,030
Jesse!

3
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,350
Show yourself right now!

4
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,950
I'll be in touch.

5
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,470
Okay. Hey, Huell.

6
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,720
Listen, I want you to

7
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,720
swing by the high school

8
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,720
on your way to Saul's.

9
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,920
I can't believe he would

10
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,920
go after my son, but...

11
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,990
You got it.

12
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,990
And Kuby's at the car wash, right?

13
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,310
Parked right across the street.

14
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,310
All's quiet. No Pinkman.

15
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,390
Okay. Just find him.

16
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,630
Please leave a message.

17
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,990
Jesse, listen.

18
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,270
I mean, obviously,

19
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,270
you've changed your mind here,

20
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,270
and so thank you for that.

21
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,900
And I know you're angry.

22
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,390
I wanna fix this, okay?

23
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,150
Whatever it takes, all right?

24
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,070
We'll talk, and we will fix this.

25
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,390
Until then, just...

26
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,230
Just sleep it off, okay?

27
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,900
And then call me.

28
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,630
Be safe.

29
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,710
How's it coming?

30
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,950
I replaced the doorjamb

31
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,950
and the striker plate.

32
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,270
Switch this out, we'll be good to go.

33
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,270
Good.

34
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,830
Do you want separate keys

35
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,830
for the different locks

36
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,790
or do you want one working both?

37
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,790
No, no, no. No re-key.

38
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,230
Same exact keys as before.

39
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,860
Usually with a break-in,

40
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,860
people like to get new keys.

41
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,990
No, same keys, same locks.

42
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,110
The old keys

43
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,110
have to work here, okay?

44
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,990
Okay.

45
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,990
All right.

46
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,910
Good.

47
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,440
Good. Good, good, good.

48
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,830
Oh, no, no.

49
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,830
Hey, guys, guys, guys.

50
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,590
Cut that. Yeah, this...

51
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,590
That area's still pretty bad.

52
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,030
Right. We'll have to

53
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,030
go over this a lot more.

54
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,870
We've made

55
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,870
three passes already.

56
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,510
Like I say, gasoline's tricky.

57
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,510
No, no, no. The smell has got

58
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,510
to be gone completely.

59
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,230
My wife is coming home,

60
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,230
and I can't have any odor, any stain,

61
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,590
any sign that anything

62
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,590
happened here.

63
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,230
Understand?

64
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,790
I-- I know. This is short notice,

65
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,790
and I really appreciate it.

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,390
Sir, we'd love to take

67
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,390
more of your money,

68
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,240
but you've got gas soaked

69
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,240
through to your subfloor.

70
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,390
Until you pull this up

71
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,390
and get new carpet,

72
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,390
new padding,

73
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,750
this is as good as it gets.

74
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,510
Is that gasoline?

75
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,670
Ask Dad.

76
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,670
Hey. Over here.

77
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,790
What happened?

78
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,790
What happened is that

79
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,270
I should sue someone.

80
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,270
That's what happened.

81
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,910
So I'm on my way to the drugstore,

82
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,910
and I have to stop to get some gas

83
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,070
and there is this

84
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,070
total pump malfunction.

85
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,390
You know what?

86
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,390
She shouldn't be in this room.

87
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,320
I mean, this is supposedly green,

88
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,320
but you know how it is.

89
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,870
You can close the windows

90
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,870
in the nursery

91
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,710
because it's really

92
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,710
only out here.

93
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,030
This is as good as it gets.

94
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,630
So, uh...

95
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,830
pump malfunction?

96
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,430
Yeah. I'm standing there filling up

97
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,430
like I've done a thousand times

98
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,550
and I hear a chunk.

99
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,550
You know, the pump's nozzle.

100
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,870
The metal thing.

101
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,870
The thing you squeeze?

102
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,270
I hear a chunk.

103
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,270
So I suppose, in my naivetÃ©

104
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,990
I took to understand that gas is

105
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,990
no longer coming out of the nozzle

106
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,190
so I pull out the hose

107
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,190
to put it back and whoosh!

108
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,950
Yeah, I am suddenly

109
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,950
soaked in gasoline.

110
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,350
I mean, on my arms

111
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,350
and my legs and my groin.

112
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,830
So now I am in a panic.

113
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,830
I race home, I run inside the house,

114
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,550
and I'm stripping off

115
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,550
my clothes as fast as I can.

116
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,790
I jump in the shower.

117
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,230
It's not until

118
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,230
after I get out of the shower

119
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,750
that I realize

120
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,750
my gas-covered clothes

121
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,510
have been soaking

122
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,510
in the living room rug

123
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,510
this entire time.

124
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,230
I mean, it's-- It's--

125
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,230
The whole thing is just so stupid.

126
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,670
I could have rinsed off

127
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,670
at the station.

128
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,670
Halfway home, I started to realize,

129
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,470
wait a minute, there's a water hose

130
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,470
right there next to the air pump.

131
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,790
You know, for tires.

132
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,950
Anyway, so that was my day.

133
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,310
How was yours?

134
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,790
Dad?

135
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,790
Yeah.

136
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,110
Please, can you just tell the truth?

137
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,630
Tell-- What do you mean?

138
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,630
You fainted, didn't you?

139
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,630
Because you're sick again?

140
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,230
You were pumping gas,

141
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,230
and the fumes,

142
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,710
they made you pass out again.

143
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,070
Just-- Just admit it.

144
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,390
No, the-- No.

145
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,110
It was the pump.

146
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,750
All right, I...

147
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,800
Maybe I did get a little

148
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,800
swimmy at one point

149
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,070
but I did not faint. Okay?

150
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,630
I'm fine, and that's the truth.

151
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,550
However, in the best interest

152
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,550
of all of our continued good health,

153
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,670
I don't think we can stay here.

154
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,510
I mean,

155
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,510
not until we get new carpet.

156
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,670
Yeah.

157
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,870
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie,

158
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,870
they got plenty of space.

159
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,310
Hey, what about a hotel?

160
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,030
A hotel. That could be sweet.

161
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,790
A good one.

162
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,310
I like the way you're thinking. Yes.

163
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,310
Could be a little family vacation.

164
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,070
Might be fun.

165
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,070
What do you say?

166
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,070
Why don't you put

167
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,070
some clothes together.

168
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,550
Yeah. All right.

169
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,670
I'm sorry. It's not my finest hour.

170
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,400
I'll go pack a bag.

171
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,030
Okay.

172
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,030
Okay.

173
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,390
Think this'll leave a scar?

174
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,390
I never should have let

175
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,390
my dojo membership run out.

176
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,710
Jesus. Jesse did that?

177
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,550
Yeah, but you gotta understand,

178
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,550
deep down he loves me.

179
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,030
So where is he?

180
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,030
Still looking.

181
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,030
Where have you looked?

182
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,590
His place, his folk's place,

183
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,590
this Brock kid's place.

184
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,470
Crack shacks at Siesta Hills,

185
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,470
the Indigo, the Crystal Palace,

186
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,470
go-kart joint on Copper Ave,

187
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,150
AA meeting off the 40.

188
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,710
His buddies,

189
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,710
Beaver and what's-his-name?

190
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,990
Badger and Skinny Pete.

191
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,990
Yeah, no, he's not with them.

192
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,870
They could be

193
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,870
covering for him.

194
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,350
I posed as a meter reader. I put a bug

195
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,350
on the tall kid's mom's place.

196
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,870
For three hours straight,

197
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,870
all he talked about was

198
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,870
something called Babylon 5.

199
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,750
I checked with my gal at A.P.D.

200
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,790
Pinkman's not in their system

201
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,830
so the cops don't have him.

202
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,830
Yet.

203
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,350
Maybe he changed his mind

204
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,350
about leaving,

205
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,750
called your guy back.

206
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,670
Somebody misses their first chance

207
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,670
with my guy, there's no second.

208
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,630
Well, keep looking.

209
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,430
What then?

210
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,630
What do you mean?

211
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,510
I mean, Pinkman's like a bad penny.

212
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,190
Sooner or later, he'll turn up.

213
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,870
I'm wondering what you wanna do

214
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,870
when he does.

215
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,070
Jesse is upset about the boy.

216
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,750
I just need to explain to him

217
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,750
why that had to happen.

218
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,430
Okay, but say, you know,

219
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,430
just for the sake of argument,

220
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,710
the kid's not in the mood

221
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,710
for a nuanced discussion

222
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,830
of the virtues of child poisoning.

223
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,150
His plans are running more towards

224
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,150
stabbing you to death

225
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,990
with a pointed stick.

226
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,990
In that scenario, then what?

227
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,710
You have a suggestion?

228
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:51,080
We were wondering if maybe this

229
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:51,080
isn't an Old Yeller type situation.

230
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,750
Old Yeller?

231
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,270
Yeah, Old Yeller was the best,

232
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,270
most loyal dog there ever was.

233
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,390
I mean, everybody loved that mutt

234
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,230
but one day he showed up rabid

235
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,230
and little Timmy,

236
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,230
for Old Yeller's own sake,

237
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,150
had to, uh...

238
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,790
Oh, you-- You saw the movie.

239
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,590
You're full of colorful metaphors,

240
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,590
aren't you, Saul?

241
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,830
Belize, Old Yeller...

242
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,750
Just brimming with advice.

243
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,790
Do not float that idea again.

244
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,190
Find him.

245
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,590
Sorry. Ah. Sorry.

246
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,950
Room key wouldn't

247
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,950
let me into the ice room

248
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,350
so I had to go down

249
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,350
to the front desk.

250
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,350
But here we are.

251
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,310
Checked in on Junior.

252
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,990
Heh. Pay-per-view

253
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,990
and room service.

254
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,990
He's in heaven.

255
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,350
Hey, I thought you

256
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,350
were gonna take a bath.

257
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,710
How's Saul doing?

258
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,270
Saul? Goodman?

259
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,150
No idea.

260
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,150
No?

261
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,350
You were just out talking to him

262
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,350
in the parking lot.

263
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,510
I'm sorry. Were you spying on me?

264
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,030
Yes.

265
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,950
And I feel just awful about it too.

266
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,830
You know, I played along

267
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,950
with your pump malfunction

268
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,950
bullshit

269
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,270
because Junior

270
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,270
was standing right there,

271
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,550
but now I would like to know

272
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,550
what's going on.

273
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,760
First of all, it's no big deal.

274
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,070
Coming here is just me

275
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,070
being overly cautious.

276
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,120
Jesse Pinkman, you know?

277
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,470
He came over to our house

278
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,470
that time for dinner, remember?

279
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,470
Well, he... He got upset over this...

280
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,110
Something he thinks I did.

281
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,310
I did do it.

282
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,480
But I did it for very good reasons.

283
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,480
And it's just-- It's complicated.

284
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,710
Wait, are you...?

285
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,520
Are you telling me that he tried to

286
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,630
burn our house down?

287
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,910
That was...

288
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,470
probably, for a brief moment,

289
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,470
his intention,

290
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,390
but, obviously,

291
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,390
he changed his mind.

292
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,950
And how does that work?

293
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,680
Him--? Him changing his mind?

294
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,030
Ah, God.

295
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,990
Look...

296
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,350
You've got to understand

297
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,350
that with Jesse,

298
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:09,190
there are emotional issues,

299
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:09,190
personal issues, some drug abuse.

300
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,440
But he has always been more of

301
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,440
a danger to himself than anyone else.

302
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,470
He has a tendency

303
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,470
to fly off the handle, that's all.

304
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,680
So he has never hurt anybody?

305
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,390
No.

306
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,070
I can't believe

307
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,070
you got her down so fast.

308
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,150
So...

309
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,190
what's your course of action here?

310
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,470
Saul's guy, Kuby, tracks him down,

311
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,470
which shouldn't take long,

312
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,200
and when he does, I'm gonna...

313
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,710
I'm gonna talk to him.

314
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,430
Make him see reason.

315
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,590
Talk to him?

316
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,630
Make him see reason?

317
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,470
So I'm clear...

318
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,640
these are just euphemisms

319
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,950
you're using here, right?

320
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,790
No.

321
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,200
What?

322
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,950
Wh--? What does that mean?

323
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,470
My God.

324
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,470
I knew this was going to happen.

325
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,310
I knew it. I told you that someday,

326
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,470
someone was going to come

327
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,470
to our door and try to hurt us.

328
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,960
And now here we are.

329
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,230
No.

330
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,710
Jesse didn't go there to hurt anyone.

331
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,150
He poured gasoline

332
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,150
all over our house, Walt.

333
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,670
He tried to set our house on fire.

334
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,990
He changed his mind.

335
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,990
He didn't do it, did he?

336
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,270
What if he changes it back?

337
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,110
Walt, you need

338
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,870
to deal with this.

339
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,590
How much have you had to drink?

340
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,590
Heh, heh.

341
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,360
Not nearly enough.

342
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,350
I don't know how we got off

343
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,870
on whatever it is

344
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,870
we're talking about here...

345
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,030
but, clearly, I haven't explained

346
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,030
the situation well enough

347
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,150
because this is a big overreaction.

348
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,030
We all need to just take

349
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,030
a deep breath and calm down

350
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,110
because Jesse isn't just some...

351
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,430
Some-- Some rabid dog.

352
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,310
This is a person.

353
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,310
A person that is a threat to us.

354
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,950
I mean, my God, where we are now

355
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,950
with Hank and Marie

356
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,270
and that awful tape we made.

357
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,870
After everything we've done,

358
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,470
you can't just talk to this person.

359
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,320
You're saying...

360
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,870
that I just...

361
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,430
What--? What exactly are you saying?

362
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,870
We've come this far.

363
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,350
For us.

364
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,030
What's one more?

365
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,590
Jesse!

366
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,320
Stop what you're doing

367
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,320
and turn and face me!

368
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,830
You wanna--?

369
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,830
You wanna know what he did?

370
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,190
You wanna hear about it?

371
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,030
Jesse, put out the lighter.

372
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,030
He poisoned a little kid.

373
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,030
An 8-year-old boy.

374
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,230
Just because, you know--

375
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,950
Just as a move!

376
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,580
Walt's a bastard. Secret's out.

377
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,870
We'll talk about it.

378
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,950
But I need you to put out

379
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,950
the lighter, okay?

380
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,840
Look, Jesse...

381
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,470
Jesse, I don't wanna kill you.

382
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,110
And you don't wanna be killed.

383
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,150
So put it out.

384
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,940
He can't keep getting away with it!

385
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,190
He can't keep getting away with it!

386
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,470
He won't.

387
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,350
You really wanna burn him down?

388
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,710
Let's do it together.

389
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,830
You were following me?

390
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,030
Yeah. Since Goodman's.

391
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,750
Where we going now?

392
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,910
DEA. Downtown.

393
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,520
What, I'm, like, arrested?

394
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,070
Yeah, you know how this works.

395
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,310
Be a good witness for me,

396
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,270
it'll go better for you.

397
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,950
Yeah, sitting around MDC,

398
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,390
waiting to be a witness

399
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,390
against Mr. White.

400
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,750
It's... Heh.

401
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,110
It's gonna go great for me.

402
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,920
So...

403
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,470
you're angry.

404
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,200
I can't sleep. I'm not eating.

405
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,310
Last night, I was online for six hours

406
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,310
looking up untraceable poisons.

407
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,270
This close family friend

408
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,870
had been keeping a secret

409
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,870
from you and Hank,

410
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,950
and somehow this person's secret

411
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,950
became known,

412
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,830
and now you're sad and hurt

413
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,830
and angry.

414
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,870
I'm--? I'm in the ballpark?

415
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,750
To be this wrong

416
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,750
about someone.

417
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,830
This off.

418
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,110
We all lead double lives

419
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,110
to some extent, don't we?

420
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,270
We all have our secrets.

421
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,270
Yeah. Not like this.

422
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,270
Not like him.

423
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,310
Marie, I think it's time you filled me in

424
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,310
on some more details here.

425
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,470
Who and what are we talking about?

426
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,430
I said I can't do that.

427
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,870
It'd be bad for Hank.

428
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,390
Our friend made that clear

429
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,390
in his little movie.

430
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,830
Those kids...

431
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,750
under his roof. That baby.

432
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,190
I'm sick just thinking about it.

433
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,590
How could I have not seen this?

434
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,470
If I weren't being such a...

435
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,750
idiotic-- Stupid idiot, I could've--

436
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,950
We could have...

437
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,110
Blackjack winnings.

438
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,110
Nothing suspicious about that at all.

439
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,550
Tell me about this movie.

440
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,870
Dave, can we simply

441
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,230
just focus on my feelings here?

442
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,110
The details don't really matter, do they?

443
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,110
There's nothing to be done, okay?

444
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,150
He screwed us and he won.

445
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,750
Can we just...?

446
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,630
Can we talk about

447
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,630
something else, please?

448
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,510
Yes?

449
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,430
How's work?

450
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,510
Last week, you were upset

451
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,510
about the new parking rules.

452
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,350
Marie?

453
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,230
Saxitoxin.

454
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,940
Derived from shellfish.

455
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,510
Produces a flaccid paralysis

456
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,510
that leaves the victim conscious

457
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,470
through a progression of symptoms.

458
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,270
Death occurs from respiratory failure.

459
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,110
That is definitely a contender.

460
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,590
Marie,

461
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,910
you're not ready to fill me in here,

462
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,790
that's fine.

463
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,390
But I want you to listen.

464
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,670
There is no problem,

465
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,670
no matter how difficult

466
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,830
or painful or seemingly unsolvable,

467
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,950
that violence won't make worse.

468
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,990
I know, I...

469
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,750
Don't worry. I wouldn't hurt anybody.

470
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,470
I just...

471
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,430
It just feels good to think about it.

472
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,820
Hey, babe.

473
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,820
What's the story here?

474
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,950
Oh, well, something's come up.

475
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,230
I thought you might wanna get out

476
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,230
of the house for a day or two.

477
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,910
You thought I'd pack up

478
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,910
and move out of my own house.

479
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,400
Why? What's going on?

480
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,670
Look, I don't wanna get into it now.

481
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,030
But you know that thing with Walt,

482
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,030
there's...

483
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,510
There's been a development.

484
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,510
What happened? Are you in danger?

485
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,510
No, no, no, not at all.

486
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,670
Just-- It's a fluid situation.

487
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,560
I think it might go a little smoother

488
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,560
if you're not here.

489
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,790
So I... It's gonna be great, you know?

490
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,390
I booked you a spa package

491
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,390
at La Posada.

492
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,470
You can do that river-stones thing.

493
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,470
Hank, what the hell is going on?

494
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,030
Hank?

495
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,350
We have a guest.

496
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,670
He was a little keyed up.

497
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,670
Gave him a couple sleeping pills.

498
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,710
Okay. Okay, so listen.

499
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,070
I bring that kid in,

500
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,070
put him in the system,

501
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,830
Walt's gonna find out

502
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,830
five minutes later. You know?

503
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,150
My last 10 witnesses

504
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,150
died in jail, remember?

505
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,310
And I can't use a DEA safe house

506
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,310
without writing him up.

507
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,110
I can't risk a motel.

508
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,920
I know it sounds crazy,

509
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,920
but this is the best place.

510
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,390
For now.

511
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,390
Just a day or two, tops--

512
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,750
Okay, just answer me

513
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,750
this one question:

514
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,790
Is this bad for Walt?

515
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,480
Yeah. Very.

516
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,460
Good. I'm staying.

517
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,460
I'll heat up lasagna.

518
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,260
Phone's ringing.

519
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,510
You have one new message.

520
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,950
Jesse, listen. Uh...

521
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,470
I mean, obviously,

522
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,470
you've changed your mind here

523
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,470
and so thank you for that.

524
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,670
And I know you're angry.

525
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,780
I wanna fix this, okay?

526
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,510
Whatever it takes, all right?

527
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,710
We'll talk, and we will fix this.

528
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,630
Until then, just...

529
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,390
Just sleep it off, okay?

530
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,350
And then call me.

531
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,790
Be safe.

532
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,430
Hey.

533
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,510
Hey.

534
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,750
What are you still doing up?

535
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,150
Couldn't sleep.

536
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,950
Ah. You and me both.

537
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,950
Here. Have a seat.

538
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,270
Everything okay?

539
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,270
Oh, yeah.

540
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,560
Just business stuff.

541
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,070
Going over some options.

542
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,510
You guys still think

543
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,510
you might buy another car wash?

544
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,710
Oh, uh-- Yeah. Well, maybe.

545
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,510
See how it goes.

546
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,320
How it goes now that--

547
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,830
Now that you're--

548
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,830
You're sick again, right?

549
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,230
No. That's not what I mean.

550
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,080
Hey. Told you not to worry,

551
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,080
remember?

552
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,630
How--? How can I not worry?

553
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,710
Come on.

554
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,710
You think I came all this way

555
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,310
just to let something as silly

556
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,310
as lung cancer take me down?

557
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,030
Not a chance.

558
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,430
I'm not going anywhere.

559
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,310
Should've brought

560
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,310
our suits, huh?

561
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,910
It's okay.

562
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,270
It's all right.

563
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,470
I'll be up in a minute.

564
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,110
Okay.

565
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,950
See you in the morning.

566
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,950
Okay.

567
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,720
Would you like some coffee?

568
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,400
Morning.

569
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,630
You want some coffee?

570
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,600
No. The lady, um...

571
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,350
I think your wife...

572
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,000
You take cream and sugar?

573
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,030
Uh-- Black's--

574
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,030
Black's good.

575
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,790
Thanks.

576
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,120
Thanks.

577
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,110
Thanks.

578
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,470
This is probably

579
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,470
gonna take a while.

580
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,190
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

581
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,270
I'll run some errands.

582
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,270
Okay.

583
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,990
All right.

584
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,110
Uh... You remember Agent Gomez?

585
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,110
How you feeling? Your head clear?

586
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,110
Yeah.

587
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,750
This-- This can't be what you mean

588
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,750
by burning him to the ground, right?

589
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,710
I got stories that'll make your toes curl,

590
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,960
but, you know, it's just "my word

591
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,960
against his word" kind of stuff.

592
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,350
So, you know, I don't really

593
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,350
have any, like, proof or anything.

594
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,510
Gomey, can you grab

595
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,510
the curtains over there?

596
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,180
There's a glare thing

597
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,180
happening here.

598
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,280
You know he's retired,

599
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,280
right? He's...

600
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,190
He's not even

601
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,190
in the business anymore.

602
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,630
So you're never gonna catch him

603
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,630
with a camcorder.

604
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,270
We're gonna catch him.

605
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,270
We gotta do this first, okay?

606
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,270
Come on.

607
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,070
Just tell us everything

608
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,070
you remember.

609
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,350
Any business dealings,

610
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,350
any personal dealings,

611
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,670
any criminal activity

612
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,670
you were a witness or a party to.

613
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,470
Anything and everything.

614
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,390
Just tell us your story, okay?

615
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,870
Start from the beginning.

616
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,870
When did you first meet Walter White?

617
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,910
Right. Okay, uh...

618
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,390
I first met Mr. White--

619
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,590
Walter White.

620
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,270
--in junior year chemistry.

621
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,830
He was my teacher.

622
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,760
You believe him?

623
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,830
Yeah. I do, unfortunately.

624
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,550
And I hate to admit it,

625
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,550
but I think the kid is right.

626
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,830
There is no physical evidence,

627
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,830
not that I heard.

628
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,230
Yeah, well, no weapons,

629
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,230
no bodies, no working lab.

630
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,030
Just the word

631
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,030
of one nut-job meth-head

632
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,150
against

633
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,150
Mr. Rogers-Has-a-Lung-Tumor.

634
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,470
So do we take a run

635
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,470
at Lydia Rodarte-Quayle?

636
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,750
Vamonos Pest?

637
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,750
Follow up with

638
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,750
the Drew Sharp killing?

639
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,270
Where do we start?

640
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,520
I say we start with this.

641
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,350
Jesse...

642
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,950
I'm gonna be at Civic Plaza

643
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,950
tomorrow at noon.

644
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,790
I hope you'll give me the chance

645
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,790
to explain myself

646
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,430
and talk through everything

647
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,430
once and for all.

648
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,510
I'll be alone and unarmed.

649
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,710
So if you wanna come and shoot me

650
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,710
in the head, that's up to you.

651
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,310
Either way...

652
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,750
I'm in your hands.

653
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,310
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

654
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,870
Go and talk to that asshole?

655
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,270
You can't be serious.

656
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,350
Go and listen.

657
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,350
He wants to explain himself.

658
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,510
We put a wire on you

659
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,510
and let him explain.

660
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,030
So your plan is to do his plan?

661
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,030
You seriously think that this--?

662
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,150
This whole

663
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,150
"once and for all in the plaza" thing

664
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,910
is so he can talk to me?

665
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,710
Why not?

666
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,630
I-- I-- I can't believe you two.

667
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,310
The dude wanted me out of town

668
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,310
before I came to burn his house down,

669
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,350
and now I'm more of a threat to him.

670
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,310
And he's got a zero-tolerance policy

671
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,310
on threats, you know?

672
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,430
If I go to this plaza,

673
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,430
I'm a dead man, is why not.

674
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,590
Hey, Walt's ruthless.

675
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,870
He'll do just about anything

676
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,870
to protect his interests.

677
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,920
I agree.

678
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,920
Except when it comes to you.

679
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,910
He cares about you.

680
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,910
Heh.

681
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,230
Can't you see?

682
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,680
Oh, yeah. You mean when he's not

683
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,680
ripping me off or calling me an idiot

684
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,670
or poisoning people

685
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,670
that I care about?

686
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,950
Yeah, no, Mr. White's gay for me.

687
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,950
Everyone knows that.

688
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,840
No, I mean it.

689
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,840
Based on everything you told us.

690
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,950
Uh, he paid for your rehab,

691
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,510
ran over those two drug dealers

692
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,510
with his car.

693
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,160
Sounds like he saved your life.

694
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,670
Made you a 50-50 partner.

695
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,670
He didn't need to do that.

696
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,870
Yeah, he sort of did.

697
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,870
I'm the only one near

698
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,870
as good as him.

699
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,710
I don't know. The way you tell it,

700
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,030
sounds like he's manipulating you

701
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,030
to stick around.

702
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,270
Like he doesn't wanna lose you.

703
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,270
All those numbers he runs on you

704
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,080
over and over,

705
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,080
helping you find the ricin cigarette.

706
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,910
Look how far he'll go to show you--

707
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,750
To convince you

708
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,750
that he's not such a bad guy.

709
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,590
That's what this is.

710
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,590
What if it's about, um,

711
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,550
killing me, you know?

712
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,910
You know, getting me out in the open,

713
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,310
hire some, uh--

714
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,310
Some clock-tower guy

715
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,030
or have me sit on a poisoned needle

716
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,030
or something, you know?

717
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,600
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

718
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,430
The plaza's one of the most wide-open

719
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,430
public places in all of Albuquerque.

720
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,920
It's the middle of the day.

721
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,670
And Agent Gomez and I will

722
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,670
be right there with you.

723
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:00,040
Look, you two guys

724
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:00,040
are just guys, okay?

725
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,950
Mr. White, he's the devil.

726
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,110
You know, he is.

727
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,110
He is smarter than you,

728
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,350
he is luckier than you.

729
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,110
Whatever-- Whatever you think

730
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,110
is supposed to happen,

731
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,550
I'm telling you,

732
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,550
the exact reverse opposite of that

733
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,240
is gonna happen, okay?

734
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,110
Jesse, Jesse,

735
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,110
we're not brainstorming here.

736
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,430
This is not asking.

737
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,430
Unless you know another way to get the

738
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,430
man or you wanna take your chances

739
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,590
with the banger boys over in MDC,

740
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,590
then this is it.

741
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,480
This is what's happening.

742
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,590
I gotta piss. Can I piss?

743
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,590
Yeah. Down to the left.

744
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,470
You got another SD card?

745
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,110
What?

746
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,110
What if the kid's right?

747
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,470
What if it's a trap?

748
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,840
The kid?

749
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,070
Oh, you mean the junkie murderer

750
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,670
that's dribbling all over

751
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,670
my guest bathroom floor?

752
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,350
Well, then, he's right.

753
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,510
Pinkman gets killed,

754
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,990
and we get it all on tape.

755
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,910
Remember, you're hurt, angry,

756
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,910
but you're here for answers, okay?

757
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,830
But don't... Don't push the questions.

758
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,790
Okay?

759
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,790
Let's not get him suspicious, all right?

760
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,630
You let him do the talking, right?

761
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,110
Just relax.

762
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,110
That's what matters most.

763
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,270
Don't cross your arms,

764
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,270
if you can help it.

765
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,620
Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.

766
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,590
Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.

767
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,590
You getting that?

768
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,990
Loud and clear, idiota.

769
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,990
How's it looking, Gomey?

770
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,670
No change.

771
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,550
He's just sitting there.

772
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,040
Are we doing this, or what?

773
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,630
Ready to kick some ass, partner?

774
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,030
All right. Time to go.

775
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,030
Okay.

776
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,030
Hey, Hank, you got eyes on this?

777
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,030
What's with the kid?

778
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,070
He's just standing there.

779
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,590
What the hell is he doing?

780
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,790
He's on the move now.

781
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,790
He's taking off. I think he's running.

782
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,950
Oh, no, no, no, kid. Come on.

783
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,760
You got him? He's at the pay phone.

784
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,910
Who the hell is he calling?

785
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,430
Oh, no, no, no. Come on, kid.

786
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,230
No. Come on.

787
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,430
Hello?

788
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,470
Nice try, asshole.

789
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,910
Jesse, where are you?

790
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,150
I just wanna talk.

791
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,510
No. I'm not doing what you want

792
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,510
anymore. Okay, asshole?

793
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,830
This is just a heads-up

794
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,830
to let you know I'm coming for you.

795
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,510
See, I decided that burning down

796
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,510
your house is nothing.

797
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,910
Next time, I'm gonna get you

798
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,910
where you really live.

799
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,950
Jesse, listen.

800
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,550
Jesse? Jesse?

801
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,440
Daddy! Daddy!

802
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,440
Hey!

803
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,270
Get in.

804
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,000
Son of a bitch!

805
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,000
Stupid, high little--

806
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,670
What the hell

807
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,670
was that all about?

808
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,310
What were you thinking?

809
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,470
Thinking there's another way.

810
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,470
What?

811
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,270
To get him.

812
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,270
There's another way.

813
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,150
A better way.

814
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,350
Hey.

815
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,350
It's Walt.

816
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,600
I'm okay.

817
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,670
I, uh...

818
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,200
Todd...

819
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,990
I think I might have another job

820
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,990
for your uncle.
