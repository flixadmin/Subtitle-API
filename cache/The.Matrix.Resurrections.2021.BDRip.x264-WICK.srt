1
00:00:58,065 --> 00:00:59,775
- Seq, I'm in.
- Captain.

2
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:01,110
You were right.

3
00:01:01,193 --> 00:01:02,611
The skylight
was a window pane.

4
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,196
I've got
serious interference.

5
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,614
Weird.
It's some kind of Modal.

6
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,491
Looks like old code.

7
00:01:07,575 --> 00:01:08,951
It feels really familiar.

8
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:10,786
Drop a pin.
I'll signal for backup.

9
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:12,538
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Bugs?

10
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:13,831
If the general finds out
we've been fishing...

11
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:15,583
A quick peek can't hurt.

12
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:16,959
Did you hear that?

13
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:18,419
Shit. I think
our signal was traced.

14
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:20,629
Bugs, this feels like a trap.

15
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:21,839
Bugs!

16
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:04,298
Freeze!
Do not move!

17
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:05,341
We will shoot!

18
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:08,719
Very slowly, raise your hands.

19
00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:24,193
Here we go.

20
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:31,533
Hey, where are you going?

21
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:32,826
You were warned, Lieutenant.

22
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,162
I think we can handle
one little girl.

23
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:39,708
You're wasting your time!

24
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,044
My men are bringing her
down now.

25
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:43,212
No, Lieutenant,

26
00:02:44,296 --> 00:02:46,298
your men are already dead.

27
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,102
Seq, you with me?

28
00:02:58,185 --> 00:02:59,561
This old code keeps crashing.

29
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:00,979
Your projection's breaking up.
Switch to audio.

30
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:02,398
Bugs,
this is a direct violation

31
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:03,732
of the general's protocols.

32
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,234
I know, I know.

33
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:06,944
But something
is happening here.

34
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,571
Something important.

35
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:10,739
Oh, fuck.

36
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,408
We know what happens next.

37
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,159
She kicks their ass.

38
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:38,100
Now she makes a call.

39
00:03:38,183 --> 00:03:39,435
The line was traced.

40
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:41,770
- And then...
- Then she runs for her life.

41
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,188
Are there any agents?

42
00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:44,690
We know this story.

43
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:47,860
This is how it all began.

44
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:50,404
God damn it.

45
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:51,947
This is where he began.

46
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,284
You're thinking this Modal
is a loop? Or a treadmill?

47
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:58,912
Some sort of sequencer
evolving a program to do what?

48
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:00,164
I don't know.

49
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:02,958
But I'm going to find out.

50
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,168
All right.

51
00:04:34,782 --> 00:04:37,159
So deja vu and yet it's
obviously all wrong.

52
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:39,411
Why use old code
to mirror something new?

53
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:41,121
I don't know.

54
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,844
If that's supposed
to be Trinity,

55
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,471
that's not what happens.

56
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:01,391
Maybe this isn't the story
we think it is.

57
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:03,852
Bugs, you have
to get out of here.

58
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,188
It's gotta be a trap.

59
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:08,649
Shit.

60
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:49,565
You all carry on.

61
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:50,649
As you were.

62
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:55,195
I'm just gonna...

63
00:05:56,113 --> 00:05:57,865
see myself out.

64
00:05:57,948 --> 00:05:58,949
Kill her.

65
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:34,902
Oh, Seq!

66
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:44,012
- Why did you save me?
- You first.

67
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,847
Who are you?
Where did you come from?

68
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:47,474
Okay.

69
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:49,309
My name is Bugs.

70
00:07:49,393 --> 00:07:51,687
As in Bunny.

71
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,480
And tech that listens.

72
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:56,525
Do you know this is a Modal?

73
00:07:57,776 --> 00:07:58,902
What's a Modal?

74
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:01,279
It's a simulation
used to evolve programs.

75
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:07,035
Do you understand
that you are...

76
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:09,621
digital sentience?

77
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:11,373
I know what I am.

78
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:12,708
Just like I know my job

79
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,876
is to hunt down
and destroy synthients.

80
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,211
Like you.

81
00:08:20,382 --> 00:08:21,925
And yet...

82
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:25,012
Here we are.

83
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:26,513
Here we are.

84
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:30,267
The other agents
don't know about this room?

85
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:33,395
How'd you find it?

86
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:35,981
No one was ever
in the key shop,

87
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:37,274
so I started looking.

88
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:40,527
More you looked,
the more you found.

89
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,155
Story of my life.

90
00:08:50,287 --> 00:08:51,288
What?

91
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:55,042
I feel like I know this room.

92
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:06,094
Holy shit.

93
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:09,931
This is his apartment.

94
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,268
You mean Thomas Anderson's?

95
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:15,312
I searched everywhere.
He doesn't exist.

96
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:17,647
He stopped being Thomas
a long time ago,

97
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:20,108
but maybe you know him
by his real name.

98
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:21,943
Neo.

99
00:09:23,403 --> 00:09:24,654
You do.

100
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,324
Oh, okay.

101
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:31,995
I can't believe this,
after all these years.

102
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:35,749
You see, most people
think that Neo is dead.

103
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:38,502
But I know he's not.

104
00:09:39,461 --> 00:09:41,213
Because I've seen him.

105
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:45,258
Where?

106
00:09:45,342 --> 00:09:47,886
It's not something
I can explain easily, but...

107
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,519
But the moment
he looked at me,

108
00:09:55,602 --> 00:09:57,229
I felt something...

109
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:02,275
unlock my mind.

110
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,904
Okay.

111
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:10,158
Something like that
happened to me.

112
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,748
I saw this pattern...

113
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,459
and it was everywhere.

114
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:23,463
We can't see it,
but we're all trapped inside

115
00:10:23,547 --> 00:10:26,091
these strange,
repeating loops.

116
00:10:26,174 --> 00:10:29,427
Somehow I saw it
in the mirror.

117
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:32,264
Just a flicker,
but it was like you said.

118
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:40,147
And suddenly I understood.

119
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,691
This is not the real world.

120
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:48,488
For the first time,
I felt real purpose.

121
00:10:49,156 --> 00:10:51,116
I knew who I was

122
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:53,118
and what I had to do.

123
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:55,203
Who are you?

124
00:10:56,538 --> 00:10:58,248
What do you have to do?

125
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:02,502
I am...

126
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,671
Morpheus.

127
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:08,091
And I have to find Neo.

128
00:11:12,262 --> 00:11:13,597
Morpheus.

129
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:18,185
Okay. Okay.

130
00:11:18,268 --> 00:11:19,352
Oh, my God!

131
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:20,729
I have to get you out of here.

132
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:23,231
I need to figure out
who built this Modal.

133
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:24,900
Okay, come with me.

134
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:27,110
You have to be ready to leave.
You have to be really ready.

135
00:11:27,194 --> 00:11:28,486
And if you're not,

136
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,571
if you think that
this is where you belong...

137
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:34,492
You call this a choice?

138
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:36,077
Oh, honestly, when somebody
offered me these things,

139
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:37,662
I went off on binary
conceptions of the world

140
00:11:37,746 --> 00:11:39,331
and said there was no way
I was swallowing

141
00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:41,291
some symbolic reduction
of my life.

142
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:42,709
And the woman
with the pills laughed

143
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:43,960
'cause I was
missing the point.

144
00:11:44,044 --> 00:11:45,587
What point?

145
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,590
The choice is an illusion.

146
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:50,884
You already know
what you have to do.

147
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:58,725
Truth.

148
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,441
Okay.

149
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:07,734
There's an old building

150
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:09,402
with a skylight
and lots of stairs.

151
00:12:09,486 --> 00:12:10,695
The Lafayette.

152
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:12,322
One of the four back doors
leads there.

153
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,867
- Don't fight it.
- Whoa, what's happening?

154
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:17,035
Keep breathing.

155
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:18,495
Extraction works
pretty much the same

156
00:12:18,578 --> 00:12:20,497
for humans and programs.

157
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:28,171
Okay.

158
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:32,133
- Hey.
- Hey.

159
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:34,010
I've never worn
different glasses before.

160
00:12:34,094 --> 00:12:36,846
Yeah, looks good.
Which door?

161
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,723
- It's gotta be...
- Okay.

162
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,480
Agent White.

163
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:46,773
Agent Smith?

164
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:53,947
Go!

165
00:13:01,162 --> 00:13:02,831
Seq! Can you hear me?

166
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:04,165
Bugs! I thought I lost you.

167
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:05,500
Can you get us
to the window pane?

168
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,544
Bugs! Bugs! He's an agent!

169
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:19,973
That window! Go hard!

170
00:14:06,186 --> 00:14:08,646
What the...

171
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:16,905
What the hell?

172
00:14:33,755 --> 00:14:35,090
Something wrong?

173
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:37,926
Just a little crash.

174
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:40,387
Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.

175
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:44,265
What a beautiful day
to be alive. Am I right?

176
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:46,351
- Problemo?
- He lost something.

177
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:48,978
Is this old Matrix code?

178
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,565
A little Modal experiment.

179
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:55,610
For Binary?

180
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:58,321
- I need a coffee.
- Coffee. Yes, stat!

181
00:14:58,405 --> 00:14:59,531
I'm buying.

182
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,285
I'm not trying to blow
smoke up your ass,

183
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:08,790
but the first time I played
the trilogy, I was shook.

184
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:11,459
The paradox
between free will and destiny.

185
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:12,710
Are we all just algorithms

186
00:15:12,794 --> 00:15:14,003
doing what we're
supposed to do

187
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,797
or can we escape
our programming?

188
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,801
Genius, inside the context
of the game, BT dubs.

189
00:15:19,884 --> 00:15:21,970
Hey, did I tell you
it took over my life?

190
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:24,806
Yeah. I failed
the seventh grade.

191
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:27,058
Your game almost ruined me.

192
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:29,644
- So you've said.
- Yet here we are.

193
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:32,564
You tell me, Mr. Anderson,

194
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:33,690
is it free will

195
00:15:34,941 --> 00:15:36,568
or destiny?

196
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:43,158
Oh, yeah.

197
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:45,160
There she is.

198
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:46,744
Total f-ing MILF.

199
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,706
Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.

200
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:52,083
I'm a geek.
I was raised by machines.

201
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:53,418
Maybe you should go.

202
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:56,546
No, please.
I promise, best self.

203
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:57,881
Best self.

204
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:03,052
Sure.

205
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:05,346
You ever talk to her?

206
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:08,892
Tell you what.

207
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:13,354
For all you've done for me,
let me do this for you.

208
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:16,191
Jude, no. Stop.

209
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:17,984
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Thanks.

210
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:19,486
Hi...

211
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:21,154
I know this is all
a bit extemporaneous.

212
00:16:21,237 --> 00:16:22,864
I'm Jude Gallagher.

213
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:25,533
I work for a game company
called Deus Machina.

214
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:26,868
Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.

215
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:29,871
Tiffany.
Didn't see that coming.

216
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:31,873
- Mom loved Audrey Hepburn.
- Jude.

217
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:35,877
Oh, and this is my very
good friend, Thomas Anderson.

218
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,879
He is a bona fide
famous person

219
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:39,339
and considered by most to be

220
00:16:39,422 --> 00:16:41,424
the greatest game designer
of our generation.

221
00:16:41,508 --> 00:16:42,717
I'm sorry about this.

222
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,010
- Jude...
- Just talk to her.

223
00:16:44,093 --> 00:16:46,596
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me Tiff.

224
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:48,681
Hi.

225
00:16:55,855 --> 00:16:56,981
Have we met?

226
00:16:58,441 --> 00:17:00,568
We both come here.

227
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,070
- Can I have your morning bun?
- Hey!

228
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:03,571
Are you trying
to ball my mom or what?

229
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:04,948
Brandon!

230
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:06,908
Can I have one bite?

231
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:09,994
Babe! What's going on?
We're gonna be late.

232
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:11,996
This is my husband, Chad.

233
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,873
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

234
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,585
Babe, we gotta get
Callie to practice.

235
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,754
Right. Sorry.

236
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,464
Come on, kids. Let's move out.

237
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:46,823
What?

238
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:56,624
Sorry. It's the boss.

239
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:05,633
Billions of people
just living out their lives...

240
00:18:06,843 --> 00:18:08,678
oblivious.

241
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:13,016
I always loved that line.

242
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:14,559
You wrote that one, yeah?

243
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,439
Every time I stand here,

244
00:18:19,522 --> 00:18:22,775
I mean, O-M-G.

245
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:24,902
It's so perfect,
it's gotta be fake.

246
00:18:25,945 --> 00:18:27,363
Right?

247
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,491
Yeah.

248
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:32,493
Sure.

249
00:18:32,577 --> 00:18:34,412
Have a seat.

250
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:38,625
Smoke?

251
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:40,960
I thought you quit.

252
00:18:41,836 --> 00:18:44,213
I quit calling it a habit.

253
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:46,215
Now it's just
a guilty pleasure.

254
00:18:48,384 --> 00:18:51,971
Maybe I can make this
easy for you.

255
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:54,098
I know Binary is over budget.

256
00:18:54,182 --> 00:18:56,476
This is not about Binary, Tom.
It's bigger than that.

257
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,894
This is about our future,

258
00:18:57,977 --> 00:19:00,938
which is a sticky subject,
given our past.

259
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:02,231
What do you mean?

260
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:04,943
How's the therapy?

261
00:19:05,026 --> 00:19:06,319
Good.

262
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:08,488
Any...

263
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:10,782
episodes?

264
00:19:12,575 --> 00:19:13,660
No.

265
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:16,079
That's terrific.

266
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,292
Look, Tom, I know we've
always had our differences.

267
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:23,211
What did you say
about our first meeting?

268
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:26,547
We had all the chemistry
of an FBI interrogation.

269
00:19:29,258 --> 00:19:30,677
But look at this place.

270
00:19:31,761 --> 00:19:33,096
We did this.

271
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:35,682
Together.

272
00:19:37,058 --> 00:19:38,518
Yeah.

273
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:40,561
Now what?

274
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:44,232
Things have changed.
The market's tough.

275
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:46,609
I'm sure you can understand
why our beloved

276
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:48,069
parent company, Warner Bros.,

277
00:19:48,152 --> 00:19:50,571
has decided to make
a sequel to the trilogy.

278
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,073
What?

279
00:19:52,156 --> 00:19:54,075
They informed me they're gonna
do it with or without us.

280
00:19:54,158 --> 00:19:55,993
I thought
they couldn't do that.

281
00:19:57,203 --> 00:19:58,579
Oh, they can.

282
00:19:58,663 --> 00:19:59,997
And they made it clear

283
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:02,250
they'll kill our contract
if we don't cooperate.

284
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,043
Really?

285
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:08,005
I know you said the story
was over for you,

286
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:10,258
but that's the thing
about stories.

287
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:13,970
They never really end,
do they?

288
00:20:14,053 --> 00:20:16,597
We're still telling the same
stories we've always told,

289
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:20,977
just with different names,
different faces

290
00:20:22,603 --> 00:20:25,690
and I have to say
I'm kind of excited.

291
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:29,694
After all these years,

292
00:20:29,777 --> 00:20:32,780
to be going back
to where it all started.

293
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,199
Back to The Matrix.

294
00:20:36,325 --> 00:20:38,035
I've spoken to Marketing...

295
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,543
Tom?

296
00:20:45,626 --> 00:20:47,170
Yeah.

297
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:48,296
Are you all right?

298
00:20:50,631 --> 00:20:51,758
Yeah.

299
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:58,890
What were you feeling
at that point?

300
00:21:01,976 --> 00:21:03,770
What was I feeling?

301
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:11,819
I felt either I'm having
a mental breakdown again

302
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:16,157
or I'm living inside
a computer-generated reality

303
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,784
that has imprisoned me...

304
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:19,577
again.

305
00:21:30,254 --> 00:21:31,756
Not much of a choice.

306
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,049
No.

307
00:21:33,132 --> 00:21:34,717
Maybe it's not
as binary as that.

308
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:38,095
Maybe there are other ways
to understand what happened.

309
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:39,764
Yeah.

310
00:21:39,847 --> 00:21:42,016
Thomas, you are
a suicide survivor

311
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:44,977
gifted with
a powerful imagination.

312
00:21:45,061 --> 00:21:46,813
Those facts have combined

313
00:21:46,896 --> 00:21:49,398
to create dangerous fictions
in your life.

314
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:51,025
Yesterday,
you walked into a meeting

315
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:52,235
with your business partner

316
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:53,778
and he ambushed you,

317
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:56,280
demanding you make a game
you said you would never make.

318
00:21:56,364 --> 00:21:59,700
This attack effectively
took away your voice.

319
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:02,537
His violence triggered you
and your mind fought back.

320
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,497
You did to him
what he was doing to you.

321
00:22:05,998 --> 00:22:07,375
We've talked about the value

322
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:11,003
of adaptive anger
in healing trauma.

323
00:22:11,087 --> 00:22:14,465
Far from suggesting a repeat
of your initial breakdown,

324
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:15,758
I believe this episode

325
00:22:15,842 --> 00:22:17,635
demonstrates healthy
self-protection.

326
00:22:19,178 --> 00:22:21,389
And more importantly,
I remember how hard

327
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:24,517
it was for you
to share something like this.

328
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,311
Which tells me
just how far we've come.

329
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,694
Do you need a refill
on your prescription?

330
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:37,738
Yeah.

331
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:02,555
First of all, I know
I speak for everyone

332
00:23:02,638 --> 00:23:04,932
when I say that
I'm so, so excited

333
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,101
to be working on a game
that was such a...

334
00:23:07,184 --> 00:23:09,270
well, game changer.

335
00:23:09,353 --> 00:23:10,938
Now, the packet
in front of you

336
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,816
has our focus group research.

337
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,359
Inside, you'll find
the breakdown

338
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:18,279
including keyword association
with the brand.

339
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:21,449
The top two being
originality and fresh,

340
00:23:21,532 --> 00:23:23,576
which I think are great things
to keep in mind

341
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:25,870
as you begin
working on Matrix 4.

342
00:23:27,413 --> 00:23:28,998
And who knows how many more?

343
00:23:44,513 --> 00:23:47,934
What made Matrix different?
It effed with your head.

344
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:49,310
On point.

345
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:51,395
People want us
up in their grey space,

346
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:54,523
switching their synaptic
WTF light on.

347
00:24:03,658 --> 00:24:06,994
What made Matrix different?
It effed with your head.

348
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,913
People want us
up in their grey space,

349
00:24:08,996 --> 00:24:10,331
switching their synaptic

350
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:13,042
what the hell is going on here
light on.

351
00:24:23,135 --> 00:24:27,348
I didn't love the first one,
like some of you.

352
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:29,850
And, frankly,
I've got zero tolerance

353
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:32,353
for anything that requires
a syllabus and a highlighter.

354
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:34,313
I like my games big,
loud and dumb.

355
00:24:34,397 --> 00:24:36,357
We need guns! Lots of guns.

356
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,026
Matrix means mayhem.

357
00:24:43,698 --> 00:24:45,866
Mindless action
is not on-brand.

358
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,368
She's right.

359
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:50,496
Matrix is mind-porn.
Philosophy in shiny...

360
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:52,248
- tight PVC.
- Yeah.

361
00:24:52,331 --> 00:24:54,208
Ideas are the new sexy.

362
00:25:08,347 --> 00:25:10,057
Obviously
The Matrix is about...

363
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,393
- Trans-politics.
- Crypto-fascism.

364
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:13,394
It's a metaphor...

365
00:25:13,477 --> 00:25:15,146
of capitalist exploitation.

366
00:25:27,616 --> 00:25:31,996
This cannot be another reboot,
retread, regurgitated...

367
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:34,165
Why not? Reboots sell.

368
00:25:37,293 --> 00:25:39,295
We are so far down the wrong
rabbit hole, here, people.

369
00:25:39,378 --> 00:25:43,215
You say Matrix to anyone...
You say Matrix...

370
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:46,260
Matrix...
Matrix... Matrix...

371
00:25:46,343 --> 00:25:48,179
This is what they see.

372
00:25:54,852 --> 00:25:57,146
Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.

373
00:25:57,229 --> 00:25:59,398
Bullet time! Bullet time!

374
00:26:00,066 --> 00:26:01,108
That's two words.

375
00:26:05,112 --> 00:26:08,282
We need
a new bullet time.

376
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:14,789
We need to revolutionize
gaming again.

377
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:18,667
Revolutionize gaming
again!

378
00:26:44,568 --> 00:26:46,320
Afternoon, Tiff.

379
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:47,571
The ushe?

380
00:26:47,655 --> 00:26:49,824
You know what, Skroce?
I'm going wild.

381
00:26:49,907 --> 00:26:52,409
I'll have a cortado today.

382
00:26:52,493 --> 00:26:55,037
Fly that freak flag.

383
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:56,872
Mind if I get that?

384
00:26:56,956 --> 00:26:57,998
Oh, hi.

385
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:01,001
Hi.

386
00:27:01,085 --> 00:27:03,587
I remember
wanting a family,

387
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:04,964
but was that because

388
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:07,716
that's what women
are supposed to want?

389
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,510
How do you know
if you want something yourself

390
00:27:09,593 --> 00:27:12,721
or if your upbringing
programmed you to want it?

391
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:16,809
I pay my analyst
a lot of money

392
00:27:16,892 --> 00:27:19,478
to answer
such questions for me.

393
00:27:19,562 --> 00:27:20,771
Smart.

394
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:22,064
I should get more therapy

395
00:27:22,148 --> 00:27:24,567
but honestly,
I'm too goddamn tired.

396
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,402
Kids are exhausting, you know?

397
00:27:27,987 --> 00:27:30,239
No. Never had kids.

398
00:27:30,322 --> 00:27:33,075
Oh, right, I knew that.

399
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:35,619
Sorry. I googled you.

400
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,166
So, what's it like being
a world-famous game designer?

401
00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:42,793
Must be amazing.

402
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:44,378
A lot of hours.

403
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:46,505
Sometimes it is amazing.

404
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:48,090
Most times...

405
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,593
I don't know.

406
00:27:50,676 --> 00:27:53,179
But you made The Matrix.
Even I've heard of that.

407
00:27:53,262 --> 00:27:57,057
Yeah. We kept
some kids entertained.

408
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:59,268
So, worth it?

409
00:28:05,608 --> 00:28:08,194
Can I ask something
about your game?

410
00:28:08,277 --> 00:28:09,528
Sure.

411
00:28:09,612 --> 00:28:11,864
Did you base your
main character on yourself?

412
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:18,996
There is a lot of me in him.

413
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:24,668
Maybe a little too much.

414
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,422
Can I ask you something else?

415
00:28:28,505 --> 00:28:29,715
Please.

416
00:28:31,425 --> 00:28:33,719
There's a woman in your game.

417
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:35,930
Trinity.

418
00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:40,517
Which is a weird
coincidence also, right?

419
00:28:42,061 --> 00:28:43,187
God, yeah.

420
00:28:44,563 --> 00:28:45,814
I like her.

421
00:28:47,024 --> 00:28:49,318
I like Trinity.

422
00:28:49,401 --> 00:28:50,653
And I dig her Ducati.

423
00:28:50,736 --> 00:28:53,739
Another coincidence.
I love motorcycles.

424
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:59,745
My friend Kush and I
actually build them.

425
00:28:59,828 --> 00:29:00,955
Really?

426
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,416
You have your analyst,
I have my bikes.

427
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,129
So, I was looking at images
from your game. At Trinity.

428
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:12,424
Well, I showed Chad a scene,

429
00:29:12,508 --> 00:29:14,551
and I was like,
so, what do you think?

430
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:18,138
He didn't get it until I said,

431
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:20,224
don't you think
she looks like me?

432
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:23,769
You know what he did?

433
00:29:25,104 --> 00:29:26,355
He laughed.

434
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:33,946
And I laughed too,
like it was a joke.

435
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:35,572
How could it not be, right?

436
00:29:37,783 --> 00:29:39,410
Made me so angry.

437
00:29:40,911 --> 00:29:43,247
I hated myself for laughing.

438
00:29:44,915 --> 00:29:48,002
I wanted to kick him so hard.

439
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:50,587
Not too hard.

440
00:29:50,671 --> 00:29:53,882
Maybe just hard enough
to break his jaw off.

441
00:29:57,094 --> 00:29:58,929
And right now,
you're probably regretting

442
00:29:59,013 --> 00:30:00,514
sitting down with me.

443
00:30:02,683 --> 00:30:06,562
This is the best thing
I've done in a long time.

444
00:30:10,941 --> 00:30:12,651
I have to take this.

445
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,364
Hi, this is Tiff.

446
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,532
Oh, God, no.

447
00:30:20,576 --> 00:30:22,578
I'll be right there.

448
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:25,497
My youngest
stuck a Lego up his nose.

449
00:30:29,084 --> 00:30:30,127
I gotta go.

450
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:34,923
I hope I see you again.

451
00:30:52,858 --> 00:30:53,984
There has been a report

452
00:30:54,068 --> 00:30:55,569
of an emergency.

453
00:30:55,652 --> 00:30:57,571
Proceed calmly
to the nearest exit

454
00:30:57,654 --> 00:30:59,698
and leave the building
immediately.

455
00:30:59,782 --> 00:31:01,158
What's going on?

456
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:03,077
We probably just got swatted
by some 14-year-old.

457
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,745
Yeah, someone pissed
about the latest update.

458
00:31:04,828 --> 00:31:06,246
Or they're just a dick.

459
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,083
Please move to the exits.
Building's being evacuated.

460
00:31:30,354 --> 00:31:32,022
Sir, this way.

461
00:31:37,861 --> 00:31:39,029
Jude?

462
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,615
Jude!

463
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,040
At last.

464
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,670
I wasn't too sure
about the callback,

465
00:31:54,753 --> 00:31:56,755
but, you know,
it was hard to resist.

466
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:57,965
What?

467
00:31:58,048 --> 00:31:59,466
Morpheus Uno.
Reveal at the window.

468
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,010
Lightning,
thunder and theater.

469
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:03,971
At last.

470
00:32:04,054 --> 00:32:06,473
All these years later,
here's me,

471
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,809
strolling out
of a toilet stall.

472
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:10,018
Tragedy or farce?

473
00:32:10,102 --> 00:32:11,728
I know you.

474
00:32:11,812 --> 00:32:13,814
Not every day
you meet your maker.

475
00:32:13,897 --> 00:32:15,065
This can't be happening.

476
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:16,817
Oh, most definitely is.

477
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,361
You can't be
a character I coded.

478
00:32:19,445 --> 00:32:21,488
100% natural.

479
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:30,164
How?

480
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:32,416
All the explanation you need.

481
00:32:37,337 --> 00:32:38,505
No.

482
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,340
No, no, no.

483
00:32:40,424 --> 00:32:42,217
What do you mean, no?

484
00:32:42,301 --> 00:32:44,928
You wanted this, you did this.
This was your idea.

485
00:32:45,012 --> 00:32:49,349
It was a test. An experiment.

486
00:32:50,642 --> 00:32:51,852
An experiment?

487
00:32:53,395 --> 00:32:55,355
You put me
in a tiny-ass Modal,

488
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:56,815
left me to bang my head till

489
00:32:56,899 --> 00:32:59,151
I nearly lost my shit
searching for you

490
00:32:59,234 --> 00:33:00,736
as an experiment.

491
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:02,821
- The exit's breaking down.
- He hasn't taken the pill.

492
00:33:02,905 --> 00:33:04,239
What? There's no time.

493
00:33:04,323 --> 00:33:06,366
I know, I know.
He's having a moment.

494
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,911
Does he know how hard it was
to hack that mirror?

495
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:12,873
Still open.

496
00:33:12,956 --> 00:33:16,376
This... This can't be real.

497
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,295
Target acquired.
We got him.

498
00:33:25,886 --> 00:33:27,221
This isn't happening.

499
00:33:27,304 --> 00:33:29,765
It's in my mind.
It's in my mind.

500
00:33:29,848 --> 00:33:31,058
Hey, you!
Stop! Hold it!

501
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:48,700
This can't be happening.

502
00:33:51,828 --> 00:33:53,580
Freeze! Don't move!

503
00:34:02,548 --> 00:34:03,674
Neo!

504
00:34:18,564 --> 00:34:19,982
Oh, my God!

505
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:55,809
Neo!

506
00:35:00,689 --> 00:35:02,899
Mr. Anderson!

507
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:04,985
No!

508
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:06,111
It can't be.

509
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:16,747
I've missed you.

510
00:35:32,012 --> 00:35:33,680
It's in my mind.

511
00:35:34,806 --> 00:35:36,183
It's in my mind.

512
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:45,859
Can you hear me, Thomas?

513
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,905
Follow my voice.

514
00:35:49,988 --> 00:35:53,700
Feel the tips of your fingers.
What are they touching?

515
00:35:55,744 --> 00:35:57,120
The bell.

516
00:35:59,623 --> 00:36:01,041
Do you hear the bell?

517
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:07,506
Do you remember what happened?
How you got here?

518
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:10,425
You must have walked.

519
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:11,718
I heard Deja Vu outside,

520
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,053
opened my door,
and there you were.

521
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:21,228
You feel like
you can talk about it?

522
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:22,562
When we started
working together,

523
00:36:22,646 --> 00:36:24,398
you had lost your capacity

524
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:27,025
to discern reality
from fiction.

525
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:30,278
You came to me after
trying to jump off a building.

526
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:32,656
You said you wanted
to fly away.

527
00:36:46,002 --> 00:36:48,755
We have made
a lot of progress since then,

528
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:51,174
but you seem particularly
triggered right now.

529
00:36:51,258 --> 00:36:52,718
Can you tell me
how it started?

530
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,430
He texted me.

531
00:36:57,597 --> 00:36:58,932
Who?

532
00:36:59,015 --> 00:37:00,475
Morpheus.

533
00:37:03,353 --> 00:37:04,730
So, he's back.

534
00:37:04,813 --> 00:37:06,982
It wasn't actually him.

535
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:11,445
It was a program
I coded for a Modal.

536
00:37:11,528 --> 00:37:13,697
And this Modal, Morpheus,

537
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,782
came to help you escape

538
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:19,494
from a virtual reality
called The Matrix.

539
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:31,590
Am I crazy?

540
00:37:31,673 --> 00:37:34,134
We don't use that word
in here.

541
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:37,137
What word should I use?

542
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,557
What word explains
what is happening to me?

543
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,309
Can I see the texts?

544
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,313
They were erased.

545
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:54,905
If we got in my car
and drove to your office,

546
00:37:54,988 --> 00:37:56,948
what do you think
we'd find there?

547
00:37:57,032 --> 00:37:58,074
Nothing.

548
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:02,871
Because there was no attack.

549
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,665
No one was killed.

550
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,710
No one texted.

551
00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:10,837
My mind made it all up.

552
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:14,925
Is that what
I'm supposed to say?

553
00:38:15,008 --> 00:38:16,510
Is that what you believe?

554
00:38:17,302 --> 00:38:19,179
It felt real.

555
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:21,014
Of course.

556
00:38:21,097 --> 00:38:24,017
It was your great ambition
to make a game

557
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,478
that was indistinguishable
from reality.

558
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:28,021
To achieve this goal,

559
00:38:28,104 --> 00:38:30,565
you converted elements
of your life into narrative.

560
00:38:30,649 --> 00:38:32,901
Your sublimated anger
toward your business partner

561
00:38:32,984 --> 00:38:35,195
cast him as your nemesis.

562
00:38:35,278 --> 00:38:36,905
A married woman named Tiffany

563
00:38:36,988 --> 00:38:40,325
became the Trinity
of a doomed romance.

564
00:38:40,408 --> 00:38:44,579
Even your dislike of my cat
made it into your Matrix.

565
00:38:44,663 --> 00:38:46,456
There's nothing wrong
with that.

566
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,999
It's what artists do.

567
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:51,461
But it becomes a problem
when fantasies

568
00:38:51,545 --> 00:38:53,880
endanger us or other people.

569
00:38:56,132 --> 00:38:58,510
We don't want anyone
to get hurt,

570
00:38:58,593 --> 00:38:59,970
do we, Thomas?

571
00:39:08,061 --> 00:39:10,188
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me Tiff.

572
00:39:10,272 --> 00:39:12,691
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

573
00:39:12,774 --> 00:39:14,401
No one can tell you
you're in love.

574
00:39:14,484 --> 00:39:16,987
You just know it,
through and through.

575
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,573
Balls to bones.

576
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:21,449
You feel this?

577
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:24,870
I'm never letting go.

578
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:34,588
You have
to let it all go, Neo.

579
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:37,048
Free your mind.

580
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,362
Looks easy enough.

581
00:40:06,202 --> 00:40:08,830
Free my mind. Shit.

582
00:40:14,002 --> 00:40:16,046
Okay.

583
00:40:16,129 --> 00:40:17,547
Free my mind.

584
00:40:33,772 --> 00:40:35,315
I fly...

585
00:40:36,232 --> 00:40:38,151
or I fall.

586
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:47,202
Who the hell are you?

587
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,163
You won't remember me,

588
00:40:50,246 --> 00:40:53,500
but a long time ago,
you changed my life

589
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:55,961
when you leapt off
another roof.

590
00:40:56,044 --> 00:40:58,964
Back then, I was just like
any other coppertop,

591
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:00,757
pretending my life...

592
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,970
until I looked up
and I saw you.

593
00:41:05,053 --> 00:41:07,555
It was a different you,
but I saw

594
00:41:08,348 --> 00:41:10,100
the real you,

595
00:41:10,183 --> 00:41:11,977
just a second before...

596
00:41:13,436 --> 00:41:14,521
you leapt.

597
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:21,069
And you never fell.

598
00:41:26,366 --> 00:41:28,535
Are you the one
that hacked my Modal?

599
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,120
Yeah.

600
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:33,164
That'll be Jude.

601
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:34,582
He's not your friend.

602
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:36,126
He's a handle,
a program used to control you.

603
00:41:36,209 --> 00:41:37,252
He's on his way here,

604
00:41:37,335 --> 00:41:39,170
and he's bringing
Agents with him.

605
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,881
Jude.

606
00:41:41,965 --> 00:41:43,383
Bro, I've been calling you
all night.

607
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:45,176
We have a major problemo.

608
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,304
Are you alone?

609
00:41:51,057 --> 00:41:53,852
That's kind
of a sexy question, dude.

610
00:41:53,935 --> 00:41:56,229
They don't look like
typical Agents.

611
00:41:56,312 --> 00:41:57,731
They use bots now,
skinned as normal people,

612
00:41:57,814 --> 00:41:58,940
which means they're everywhere

613
00:41:59,024 --> 00:42:01,276
and you never know
who to trust.

614
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,111
Why should I trust you?

615
00:42:05,196 --> 00:42:08,283
Because if they open
that door, we lose our hack.

616
00:42:08,366 --> 00:42:10,076
I will be caught and killed

617
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,369
and you will be put right back

618
00:42:11,453 --> 00:42:12,704
on that treadmill
they designed for you,

619
00:42:12,787 --> 00:42:13,913
just like they did
the last time

620
00:42:13,997 --> 00:42:15,165
you tried to leap
your way out.

621
00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:18,918
I know why you left
your Modal open.

622
00:42:19,002 --> 00:42:21,463
You needed someone else
to free Morpheus.

623
00:42:21,546 --> 00:42:23,590
And it's because of him
that we were able to get to you.

624
00:42:23,673 --> 00:42:25,550
I know these things
the same way

625
00:42:25,633 --> 00:42:28,386
that I knew one day
I would find you.

626
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:31,097
And that when I did,
you would be ready for this.

627
00:42:35,685 --> 00:42:37,062
If you want the truth, Neo,

628
00:42:38,313 --> 00:42:40,315
you're going
to have to follow me.

629
00:42:41,858 --> 00:42:42,859
Okay.

630
00:43:02,378 --> 00:43:05,006
- Where are we?
- Tokyo.

631
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,925
A moving portal
makes it harder to track us.

632
00:43:07,008 --> 00:43:09,636
- Seq is the best of them.
- Portal's clean.

633
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:11,137
Reading our shadows.

634
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:15,141
I don't remember this.

635
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:17,519
We don't have to run to
phone booths anymore either.

636
00:43:27,112 --> 00:43:28,571
Door's on your right.

637
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:45,171
Set and setting, right?

638
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:46,548
Oh, no.

639
00:43:46,631 --> 00:43:48,091
It's all about set

640
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:50,176
and setting.

641
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,387
After our first contact
went so badly,

642
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:54,347
we thought elements
from your past

643
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:55,932
might help ease you
into the present.

644
00:43:56,015 --> 00:43:58,852
Nothing comforts anxiety like

645
00:43:58,935 --> 00:44:00,353
a little nostalgia.

646
00:44:00,436 --> 00:44:02,772
This is footage
from your game.

647
00:44:09,988 --> 00:44:11,990
Time is
always against us,

648
00:44:12,866 --> 00:44:14,909
etcetera, etcetera.

649
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:17,245
No one can be told

650
00:44:17,328 --> 00:44:20,623
what the Matrix is,
blah, blah, blah.

651
00:44:23,209 --> 00:44:25,170
You gotta see it
to believe it.

652
00:44:28,798 --> 00:44:30,383
Time to fly.

653
00:44:32,427 --> 00:44:33,887
Wait.

654
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:35,221
If this is real,

655
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:37,932
if I haven't lost my mind,
does that mean

656
00:44:39,642 --> 00:44:41,019
this happened?

657
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:51,487
But if it did...

658
00:44:55,617 --> 00:44:57,160
then we died.

659
00:44:57,243 --> 00:44:59,162
Obviously not.

660
00:44:59,245 --> 00:45:00,663
Why the Machines
kept you alive

661
00:45:00,747 --> 00:45:03,625
and why they went
to such lengths to hide you

662
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:05,543
are questions
we don't have answers to.

663
00:45:05,627 --> 00:45:07,212
Hide me?

664
00:45:07,295 --> 00:45:11,591
I've been at a company making
a game called The Matrix.

665
00:45:11,674 --> 00:45:14,260
Doesn't seem like they were
trying to hide anything.

666
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:15,887
We've been tracking
that company for years.

667
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:18,765
We screened every
Thomas Anderson we found.

668
00:45:18,848 --> 00:45:20,433
What we didn't understand

669
00:45:20,516 --> 00:45:23,019
was that they could
alter your DSI.

670
00:45:23,102 --> 00:45:24,854
Pods generate
your digital self-image

671
00:45:24,938 --> 00:45:27,440
through a feedback system
called Semblance.

672
00:45:27,523 --> 00:45:29,525
This is how
you look to yourself.

673
00:45:29,609 --> 00:45:33,321
Somehow they were able
to alter your DSI loop.

674
00:45:33,404 --> 00:45:35,907
This is how
everyone else sees you.

675
00:45:50,004 --> 00:45:51,965
Twenty years?

676
00:45:53,258 --> 00:45:56,803
Why did it take 20 years
to find me?

677
00:45:56,886 --> 00:45:58,721
It took a lot longer
than that.

678
00:45:58,805 --> 00:46:00,807
It's been over 60 years
since you and Trinity

679
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:02,642
flew to one
of the Machine Cities.

680
00:46:03,351 --> 00:46:04,310
What?

681
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,604
There's so much we don't know.

682
00:46:06,688 --> 00:46:08,439
Like why you've barely aged,

683
00:46:08,523 --> 00:46:10,733
or how many times
they've altered your DSI.

684
00:46:10,817 --> 00:46:12,151
But based on
what we do know,

685
00:46:12,235 --> 00:46:13,569
it appears no one found you

686
00:46:13,653 --> 00:46:15,488
because you didn't
want to be found.

687
00:46:15,571 --> 00:46:18,324
- That's not true.
- Maybe it isn't.

688
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:19,617
Maybe there's no foundation

689
00:46:19,701 --> 00:46:20,868
to the rumors
that you disappeared,

690
00:46:20,952 --> 00:46:22,120
because you were working

691
00:46:22,203 --> 00:46:23,621
with the Machines
from the beginning.

692
00:46:23,705 --> 00:46:24,831
Morpheus, stop.

693
00:46:24,914 --> 00:46:28,042
All I'm saying is
this is the moment

694
00:46:28,126 --> 00:46:30,670
for you to show us
what is real.

695
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:32,964
If you want out,

696
00:46:33,047 --> 00:46:34,424
you'll take this pill.

697
00:46:35,925 --> 00:46:38,344
But if you are
where you belong,

698
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,597
you can go back to this.

699
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,015
Every day.

700
00:46:42,098 --> 00:46:45,727
Over and over forever.

701
00:46:49,188 --> 00:46:50,398
Fuck.

702
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,617
Keep the loop tight.

703
00:47:14,047 --> 00:47:15,214
Cybebe needs
that tower pin.

704
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:17,175
I got a signal. It's faint.

705
00:47:17,258 --> 00:47:18,718
It's definitely off-grid.

706
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,019
Captain. I'm tracking
a whole lot of weird.

707
00:47:28,102 --> 00:47:29,562
- What?
- It's some kind of graft.

708
00:47:35,818 --> 00:47:37,111
Thomas?

709
00:47:38,279 --> 00:47:40,073
Oh, God.

710
00:47:40,698 --> 00:47:42,408
Oh, no.

711
00:47:43,743 --> 00:47:45,912
- We got company.
- How'd they find us?

712
00:47:47,205 --> 00:47:50,083
Thomas, none of this is real.

713
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:54,379
You are in the midst
of a serious psychotic break.

714
00:47:54,462 --> 00:47:56,547
- Lexy?
- Almost there.

715
00:47:56,631 --> 00:47:58,716
Thomas?

716
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,636
Thomas, please.
This is not a game.

717
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:03,221
Feel my hand.

718
00:48:03,304 --> 00:48:04,514
This is what is real.

719
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:09,310
Stay with me.

720
00:48:09,394 --> 00:48:11,020
No. No.

721
00:48:13,898 --> 00:48:15,108
Stay with me.

722
00:48:17,777 --> 00:48:18,778
Neo!

723
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:23,491
Morpheus!

724
00:48:25,034 --> 00:48:26,452
Let's go, let's go!

725
00:48:56,858 --> 00:48:58,943
- Bots are being activated.
- It's a swarm.

726
00:49:23,092 --> 00:49:24,177
Come on!

727
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:59,128
I got a hack
in the bathroom. Hurry!

728
00:49:59,212 --> 00:50:00,213
Yes.

729
00:50:01,005 --> 00:50:02,006
Come on!

730
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,092
Seq, where?

731
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,888
- That mirror.
- What?

732
00:50:08,971 --> 00:50:10,723
- We'll never fit.
- You gotta fit,

733
00:50:10,806 --> 00:50:12,183
'cause I don't have
another way off this train.

734
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:15,811
No, no, no.

735
00:50:15,895 --> 00:50:17,063
Think perspective.

736
00:50:17,146 --> 00:50:18,940
Closer you are,
bigger it gets.

737
00:50:22,485 --> 00:50:24,153
Okay, come on.

738
00:50:25,404 --> 00:50:26,572
In you go.

739
00:52:21,437 --> 00:52:22,813
Trinity.

740
00:52:28,152 --> 00:52:29,153
No!

741
00:53:50,025 --> 00:53:52,987
Welcome back
to the real world.

742
00:54:01,537 --> 00:54:02,705
Trinity.

743
00:54:02,788 --> 00:54:03,914
- What's up, Doc?
- His vital systems

744
00:54:03,998 --> 00:54:05,458
have been
meticulously maintained,

745
00:54:05,541 --> 00:54:07,418
but it doesn't look good.

746
00:54:12,757 --> 00:54:15,176
- We're losing him.
- Cold boot could shock him.

747
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,802
Do it.

748
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,400
I remember this.

749
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:35,613
The Construct.

750
00:54:36,405 --> 00:54:39,033
In between everything

751
00:54:39,116 --> 00:54:41,243
and nothing.

752
00:54:41,327 --> 00:54:42,995
Welcome to the Crib.

753
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,624
I've been chilling here
in the ship network...

754
00:54:50,002 --> 00:54:51,629
learning all about you.

755
00:54:56,342 --> 00:54:57,468
And me.

756
00:55:01,305 --> 00:55:05,142
Careful. It'll do your head in.

757
00:55:05,226 --> 00:55:08,771
Are memories turned
into fiction any less real?

758
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:15,194
Is reality based in memory
nothing but fiction?

759
00:55:15,277 --> 00:55:18,531
As to my role in all this,
my best guess

760
00:55:18,614 --> 00:55:19,907
is that you wrote me

761
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:22,034
as an algorithmic reflection
of two forces

762
00:55:22,117 --> 00:55:24,620
that helped you become you,

763
00:55:24,703 --> 00:55:28,165
Morpheus and Agent Smith.

764
00:55:28,249 --> 00:55:29,375
A combo pack

765
00:55:29,458 --> 00:55:31,961
of counterprogramming
that was...

766
00:55:34,755 --> 00:55:38,592
Let's just say, more than
a little bit crazy-making.

767
00:55:38,676 --> 00:55:41,595
But it worked
because here we are.

768
00:55:42,638 --> 00:55:44,223
Now, for the bad news.

769
00:55:44,306 --> 00:55:46,517
Your brain
is hooked on this shit

770
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,478
the Matrix has been
force-feeding you for years.

771
00:55:49,562 --> 00:55:51,230
Hooked bad.

772
00:55:51,313 --> 00:55:52,815
You're going through
major withdrawals.

773
00:55:52,898 --> 00:55:56,110
Docbots are giving you
crap odds for surviving.

774
00:55:56,193 --> 00:55:58,445
But, see,
they don't know you like I do.

775
00:56:01,323 --> 00:56:03,534
I know exactly what you need.

776
00:56:25,389 --> 00:56:27,099
You gotta be kidding.

777
00:56:29,226 --> 00:56:31,020
No joke.

778
00:56:31,103 --> 00:56:35,232
Could be this is the first day
of the rest of your life.

779
00:56:35,316 --> 00:56:37,151
But if you want it...

780
00:56:40,779 --> 00:56:42,114
you gotta fight for it.

781
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,201
No. I'm done fighting.

782
00:56:47,244 --> 00:56:48,245
Are you?

783
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,998
What the hell is he doing?

784
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:36,961
Oh, yeah.
They taught you good.

785
00:57:42,424 --> 00:57:45,678
Made you believe their world
was all you deserved.

786
00:57:45,761 --> 00:57:47,680
But some part of you knew
that was a lie.

787
00:57:47,763 --> 00:57:50,516
Some part of you remembered
what was real.

788
00:57:53,268 --> 00:57:54,436
You don't know me.

789
00:57:55,062 --> 00:57:56,105
No?

790
00:58:38,772 --> 00:58:40,399
I know you, because I know

791
00:58:40,482 --> 00:58:42,401
the only thing
that still matters to you.

792
00:58:42,484 --> 00:58:45,654
I know it's why you're here,
why you're still fighting

793
00:58:45,738 --> 00:58:47,322
and why you will
never give up.

794
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,838
Come on, Neo!

795
00:59:04,256 --> 00:59:05,466
This is it.

796
00:59:07,593 --> 00:59:09,178
This is your last chance.

797
00:59:17,144 --> 00:59:18,604
You gotta fight
for your goddamn life

798
00:59:18,687 --> 00:59:20,022
if you want to see
Trinity again.

799
00:59:24,943 --> 00:59:26,320
Come on, Neo! Fight for her!

800
00:59:28,947 --> 00:59:31,575
- Holy shit.
- Fight for her!

801
01:00:23,627 --> 01:00:25,337
- Hey.
- Hey.

802
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:28,757
Mind if I...

803
01:00:41,937 --> 01:00:43,438
How are you doing?

804
01:00:44,982 --> 01:00:47,109
If this plug is actually real,

805
01:00:49,069 --> 01:00:51,405
that means
they took my life...

806
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:56,326
and turned it
into a video game.

807
01:00:59,454 --> 01:01:01,081
How am I doing?

808
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,084
I don't know.

809
01:01:04,168 --> 01:01:06,336
I don't even know how to know.

810
01:01:07,462 --> 01:01:08,922
That's it, isn't it?

811
01:01:10,424 --> 01:01:12,634
If we don't know
what's real...

812
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:15,846
we can't resist.

813
01:01:18,765 --> 01:01:20,225
They took your story,

814
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:21,810
something that meant

815
01:01:22,895 --> 01:01:25,147
so much to people like me,

816
01:01:26,773 --> 01:01:29,443
and turned it
into something trivial.

817
01:01:31,236 --> 01:01:33,030
That's what the Matrix does.

818
01:01:33,864 --> 01:01:36,074
It weaponizes every idea.

819
01:01:36,825 --> 01:01:38,243
Every dream.

820
01:01:39,745 --> 01:01:41,538
Everything
that's important to us.

821
01:01:43,999 --> 01:01:46,293
Where better to bury truth
than inside something

822
01:01:46,376 --> 01:01:49,421
as ordinary as a video game?

823
01:01:49,504 --> 01:01:51,506
That sounds like the Oracle.

824
01:01:52,925 --> 01:01:54,718
Heard so much about her.

825
01:01:57,512 --> 01:01:59,056
She was gone
before I was free.

826
01:02:00,682 --> 01:02:02,100
Gone?

827
01:02:02,184 --> 01:02:05,020
When this new version
of the Matrix was uploaded,

828
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:08,065
there was a purge.

829
01:02:12,945 --> 01:02:16,698
They promised peace
and they gave us purge.

830
01:02:18,158 --> 01:02:19,618
No.

831
01:02:19,701 --> 01:02:21,411
No, there was peace.

832
01:02:22,829 --> 01:02:27,960
You made it possible,
and it changed everything.

833
01:02:28,043 --> 01:02:31,546
Doesn't feel like
it changed anything.

834
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:34,841
The Matrix is
the same or worse.

835
01:02:34,925 --> 01:02:37,135
And I'm back where I started.

836
01:02:39,888 --> 01:02:42,349
It feels like
everything I did,

837
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:44,893
everything we did...

838
01:02:50,899 --> 01:02:53,110
like none of it mattered.

839
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,989
All of it mattered.

840
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,242
I can show you.

841
01:03:10,919 --> 01:03:12,504
This is my crew.

842
01:03:15,632 --> 01:03:17,801
Our operator, Seq.

843
01:03:20,012 --> 01:03:23,890
Sequoia. But everybody
calls me Seq.

844
01:03:23,974 --> 01:03:25,434
Nice to meet you.

845
01:03:26,476 --> 01:03:28,520
Dad loved redwoods.

846
01:03:28,603 --> 01:03:29,855
When he escaped the Matrix

847
01:03:29,938 --> 01:03:31,481
and found out
they no longer existed,

848
01:03:31,565 --> 01:03:33,066
it almost killed him.

849
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:34,359
Lucky, he met Mom

850
01:03:35,235 --> 01:03:36,862
and here I am.

851
01:03:36,945 --> 01:03:40,657
This is Lexy,
Berg and Ellster.

852
01:03:41,408 --> 01:03:42,534
Hi.

853
01:03:42,617 --> 01:03:45,203
You knew my grandfather,
Captain Roland.

854
01:03:45,287 --> 01:03:47,748
Roland was your grandfather?

855
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,624
He always laughed,

856
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:50,667
joking how he never
believed in you.

857
01:03:51,793 --> 01:03:53,211
But, in private, he said that

858
01:03:53,295 --> 01:03:55,422
you freed his mind
a second time.

859
01:03:55,505 --> 01:03:57,549
Not to fanboy out here,

860
01:03:57,632 --> 01:03:59,634
but this is kind
of a huge moment for me.

861
01:03:59,718 --> 01:04:02,220
Berg is our resident
Neo-ologist.

862
01:04:02,304 --> 01:04:03,513
A what?

863
01:04:03,597 --> 01:04:06,641
There's a lot of people
out there like me

864
01:04:06,725 --> 01:04:09,061
who are a little bit
obsessed with your life.

865
01:04:09,144 --> 01:04:10,312
I would never have recognized

866
01:04:10,395 --> 01:04:11,521
your Modal
if it weren't for him.

867
01:04:11,605 --> 01:04:12,856
Whenever
you're feeling up for it,

868
01:04:12,939 --> 01:04:14,900
I've got, like,
a million questions.

869
01:04:14,983 --> 01:04:17,444
Me too. Starting with them.

870
01:04:18,779 --> 01:04:19,821
It's okay.

871
01:04:20,572 --> 01:04:21,823
Come meet him.

872
01:04:21,907 --> 01:04:23,200
This is Cybebe.

873
01:04:23,283 --> 01:04:24,701
That's Octacles.

874
01:04:24,785 --> 01:04:27,454
That's Lumin8.

875
01:04:27,537 --> 01:04:29,790
Machines are on our side now?

876
01:04:29,873 --> 01:04:31,083
They are synthients.

877
01:04:31,166 --> 01:04:32,834
It's a word
they prefer to Machines.

878
01:04:32,918 --> 01:04:34,252
Your contact
with the Synthient City

879
01:04:34,336 --> 01:04:36,713
had a huge impact
on their world.

880
01:04:36,797 --> 01:04:37,923
That's what I meant.

881
01:04:38,006 --> 01:04:39,257
What you changed

882
01:04:39,341 --> 01:04:40,926
that nobody believed
could ever be changed.

883
01:04:42,844 --> 01:04:45,347
The meaning of our side.

884
01:04:49,142 --> 01:04:50,977
Cybebe and Octacles
risked their lives

885
01:04:51,061 --> 01:04:52,229
to help get you out.

886
01:04:53,688 --> 01:04:54,689
Thank you.

887
01:04:56,233 --> 01:04:57,275
But why?

888
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,903
Not all seek to control.

889
01:04:59,986 --> 01:05:01,988
Just as not all wish
to be free.

890
01:05:03,782 --> 01:05:05,033
What is that?

891
01:05:05,117 --> 01:05:07,411
An exomorphic-particle codex.
It's pretty new.

892
01:05:07,494 --> 01:05:09,621
It gives programs
access to this world.

893
01:05:09,704 --> 01:05:10,914
Within limits.

894
01:05:10,997 --> 01:05:14,000
Limits are the domain
of the limited.

895
01:05:14,084 --> 01:05:15,627
Morpheus.

896
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:16,753
Thank you.

897
01:05:16,837 --> 01:05:18,255
It was my honor.

898
01:05:21,383 --> 01:05:22,551
How does it work?

899
01:05:22,634 --> 01:05:24,136
Paramagnetic oscillation.

900
01:05:24,219 --> 01:05:26,721
If you want, I can download
the codex manual for you.

901
01:05:26,805 --> 01:05:29,224
- Sure.
- Downloading used to be fun.

902
01:05:29,307 --> 01:05:31,685
Now it's all manuals
and diagnostics.

903
01:05:31,768 --> 01:05:33,478
Can I ask them something?

904
01:05:36,398 --> 01:05:39,651
When you unplugged me,
there was another pod?

905
01:05:40,986 --> 01:05:43,864
Yes. We've analyzed the data.

906
01:05:45,073 --> 01:05:46,408
It could be Trinity.

907
01:05:47,242 --> 01:05:48,827
It's her.

908
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:51,997
I figured we were going
to have this conversation.

909
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,000
Look, you were not
a typical flush-and-grab.

910
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:56,751
You were in this weird tower
that Cybebe

911
01:05:56,835 --> 01:05:58,920
had never accessed,
and she's now exiled.

912
01:05:59,004 --> 01:06:01,381
We burned
our one shot for you.

913
01:06:01,465 --> 01:06:03,508
Even if it were Trinity
and she wanted to be free,

914
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:05,635
we have no idea how to do it.

915
01:06:05,719 --> 01:06:06,720
Yet.

916
01:06:09,139 --> 01:06:12,017
Nobody believed
we'd ever find him,

917
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:13,143
but we did.

918
01:06:15,562 --> 01:06:17,481
Okay.

919
01:06:17,564 --> 01:06:20,692
We don't know
how to get her out... yet.

920
01:06:22,736 --> 01:06:25,405
Captain, we're approaching
security clearance.

921
01:06:26,698 --> 01:06:27,866
We're here.

922
01:06:27,949 --> 01:06:28,992
Zion?

923
01:06:37,083 --> 01:06:38,543
Have a seat.

924
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:41,379
This is Hanno.
Best pilot in our fleet.

925
01:06:41,463 --> 01:06:42,422
Quite a few synthients

926
01:06:42,506 --> 01:06:43,965
deserve that title before me.

927
01:06:44,049 --> 01:06:45,217
Mnemosyne, you are cleared

928
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:46,676
for landing. Welcome home.

929
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,428
Thank you, Control.

930
01:06:48,512 --> 01:06:50,096
We're about to crash.

931
01:06:57,020 --> 01:07:00,398
General realized we were never going to
beat the Sentinels, so...

932
01:07:00,482 --> 01:07:02,609
we just got better
at hiding from them.

933
01:07:07,197 --> 01:07:08,782
Welcome to Io.

934
01:07:10,408 --> 01:07:11,826
Io.

935
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:21,002
That looks real.

936
01:07:21,503 --> 01:07:23,088
Bio-sky.

937
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:29,010
Works kind of like
grow lights.

938
01:07:29,094 --> 01:07:30,762
It's way more complex
than that.

939
01:07:30,845 --> 01:07:33,306
It pulls water from the crust,
hydronating the air.

940
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:36,726
It balances the ECO
and our SRI cycles.

941
01:07:37,811 --> 01:07:39,145
Plus...

942
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:41,773
it is pretty to look at.

943
01:07:41,856 --> 01:07:43,650
As opposed to that.

944
01:07:44,943 --> 01:07:47,529
I guess the general sent us
a welcome party.

945
01:08:05,797 --> 01:08:07,215
God damn.

946
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,509
It is you.

947
01:08:10,385 --> 01:08:11,553
Niobe?

948
01:08:13,388 --> 01:08:16,975
A few more wrinkles
and a few less teeth,

949
01:08:17,058 --> 01:08:20,729
but wise enough to know
I don't know anything.

950
01:08:20,812 --> 01:08:23,481
I sure as shit
never saw this coming.

951
01:08:24,316 --> 01:08:25,483
Neither did I.

952
01:08:25,567 --> 01:08:26,901
I told you he was alive.

953
01:08:26,985 --> 01:08:28,945
Captain, you and your crew
have been grounded.

954
01:08:29,029 --> 01:08:30,655
General,
if you'd just let me explain.

955
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:33,366
The protocols are put in place
for everyone's protection.

956
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:35,327
I'm sorry.
I saw an opportunity

957
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:36,870
and I was afraid
we'd lose him.

958
01:08:36,953 --> 01:08:39,623
But, General, people have been
waiting for so long.

959
01:08:41,291 --> 01:08:42,542
We found The One.

960
01:08:44,377 --> 01:08:46,087
I don't believe in The One.

961
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,466
I never did.

962
01:08:50,133 --> 01:08:51,217
No?

963
01:08:52,302 --> 01:08:53,845
Me neither.

964
01:08:53,928 --> 01:08:56,306
But there was a time

965
01:08:56,389 --> 01:08:59,059
when you trusted me
with your ship,

966
01:08:59,142 --> 01:09:00,935
against the Council's orders.

967
01:09:01,019 --> 01:09:03,104
The world was different then.

968
01:09:04,939 --> 01:09:06,566
We were different.

969
01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:10,028
Report to the docks.

970
01:09:10,111 --> 01:09:11,821
Scrub down the Mnemosyne.

971
01:09:11,905 --> 01:09:14,199
Transfer your access codes.

972
01:09:14,282 --> 01:09:15,700
You are done, Captain.

973
01:09:25,377 --> 01:09:27,212
We need to talk.

974
01:09:32,425 --> 01:09:35,095
When word first came

975
01:09:35,178 --> 01:09:37,430
that it actually might be you...

976
01:09:41,184 --> 01:09:44,979
I didn't know how I would feel
in this moment.

977
01:09:52,862 --> 01:09:54,823
It is nice to see you.

978
01:09:54,906 --> 01:09:57,617
It's good to see you too.

979
01:10:03,498 --> 01:10:06,251
A long way
from Dozer's paint stripper.

980
01:10:06,334 --> 01:10:09,295
Yes.

981
01:10:09,379 --> 01:10:11,131
A lot has changed.

982
01:10:12,674 --> 01:10:14,592
Except maybe you.

983
01:10:17,387 --> 01:10:18,930
You remember this?

984
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:28,773
It's so easy to forget
how much noise

985
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:30,775
the Matrix pumps
into your head

986
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:32,652
until you unplug.

987
01:10:34,112 --> 01:10:35,488
Yeah.

988
01:10:35,572 --> 01:10:38,491
Something else
makes the same kind of noise.

989
01:10:38,575 --> 01:10:40,785
Takes over every damn thing,

990
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:42,579
just like the Matrix.

991
01:10:44,247 --> 01:10:45,248
War.

992
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:49,586
I stood at the barricade
of the Temple.

993
01:10:51,379 --> 01:10:53,673
Staring at the army of Sentinels,

994
01:10:54,799 --> 01:10:57,427
waiting for them
to kill every one of us.

995
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:01,973
But then, they left.

996
01:11:03,183 --> 01:11:05,643
They said you saved us.

997
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,895
I didn't believe it.

998
01:11:06,978 --> 01:11:10,315
Every night I would dream
of attack sirens.

999
01:11:10,982 --> 01:11:12,233
But then,

1000
01:11:14,819 --> 01:11:17,030
I would wake up to this...

1001
01:11:21,034 --> 01:11:22,494
silence.

1002
01:11:25,955 --> 01:11:27,499
I'm ashamed of it now.

1003
01:11:27,582 --> 01:11:31,586
My pessimism of how long
it took me to believe

1004
01:11:31,669 --> 01:11:34,923
a world without war
was possible.

1005
01:11:36,341 --> 01:11:38,343
You gave me that.

1006
01:11:38,426 --> 01:11:41,304
You gave that gift to us all.

1007
01:11:41,387 --> 01:11:45,058
And it is the gift
that continues to bear fruit.

1008
01:11:47,769 --> 01:11:49,521
Come help me get up.

1009
01:11:49,604 --> 01:11:51,356
Let's take a walk.

1010
01:12:15,463 --> 01:12:17,465
Beautiful.

1011
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:21,511
This is Freya, head of botany.

1012
01:12:21,594 --> 01:12:24,889
And this is Quillion,
our lead digitologist.

1013
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:28,977
I presume our guest
needs no introduction.

1014
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:31,729
Nothing travels
faster than light,

1015
01:12:31,813 --> 01:12:33,064
except gossip.

1016
01:12:35,441 --> 01:12:36,860
Welcome to the Garden, Neo.

1017
01:12:38,903 --> 01:12:40,071
A strawberry?

1018
01:12:40,154 --> 01:12:41,865
Using digital code
from the Matrix,

1019
01:12:41,948 --> 01:12:44,367
we retro-convert it
into DNA sequences.

1020
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:45,869
And they grow here?

1021
01:12:45,952 --> 01:12:47,579
It's not easy
augmenting the genome

1022
01:12:47,662 --> 01:12:50,206
to photosynthesize
Bio-sky, but...

1023
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:52,041
We're getting there.

1024
01:12:52,792 --> 01:12:54,502
Go ahead. Try it.

1025
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:04,220
We're quite excited
about the blueberries.

1026
01:13:04,304 --> 01:13:06,222
You remember that shit
we used to eat?

1027
01:13:06,306 --> 01:13:08,683
That slop
that tasted like rust.

1028
01:13:10,268 --> 01:13:13,897
Zion could have never
made something like this.

1029
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:15,607
Why?

1030
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:18,276
Because we needed synthients

1031
01:13:18,359 --> 01:13:20,320
and DI like him.

1032
01:13:20,403 --> 01:13:23,781
Zion was stuck in the past.
Stuck in war.

1033
01:13:23,865 --> 01:13:26,242
Stuck in a Matrix of its own.

1034
01:13:26,326 --> 01:13:30,204
They believed
that it had to be us or them.

1035
01:13:30,288 --> 01:13:33,291
This city was built by us

1036
01:13:33,374 --> 01:13:35,043
and them.

1037
01:13:40,715 --> 01:13:42,258
What happened to Zion?

1038
01:13:42,342 --> 01:13:45,762
I've been waiting
for you to ask that question.

1039
01:13:47,722 --> 01:13:51,184
All of the troubles
started in the Machine Cities.

1040
01:13:51,267 --> 01:13:54,979
Power plants were unable
to produce enough energy.

1041
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:58,816
Nothing can breed violence
like scarcity.

1042
01:14:00,568 --> 01:14:02,153
For the first time,

1043
01:14:02,236 --> 01:14:05,448
we saw machines at war
with one other.

1044
01:14:08,451 --> 01:14:12,455
We got word from the Oracle
of a new power rising.

1045
01:14:14,415 --> 01:14:17,085
That was the last
we heard from her.

1046
01:14:20,755 --> 01:14:22,131
Morpheus.

1047
01:14:22,215 --> 01:14:26,594
After the siege,
he was elected unanimously.

1048
01:14:26,678 --> 01:14:29,555
High Chair of the Council.

1049
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:33,059
Oh, how he loved that.

1050
01:14:33,142 --> 01:14:37,355
But as rumors
of this new power spread,

1051
01:14:37,438 --> 01:14:38,856
he ignored them.

1052
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:43,569
He was certain what you had
done could not be undone.

1053
01:14:43,653 --> 01:14:47,615
All of these people never
stopped believing in miracles,

1054
01:14:47,699 --> 01:14:50,076
believing in you.

1055
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:03,506
I'm sorry.

1056
01:15:05,341 --> 01:15:07,760
How could I know
this would happen?

1057
01:15:07,844 --> 01:15:10,138
We didn't understand
all of it back then.

1058
01:15:10,221 --> 01:15:12,056
No more than we do now.

1059
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:15,435
I didn't come here
to cause you problems, Niobe,

1060
01:15:16,477 --> 01:15:18,229
but I need your help.

1061
01:15:19,897 --> 01:15:21,357
Trinity is alive.

1062
01:15:21,441 --> 01:15:23,192
Then there is
another question.

1063
01:15:23,276 --> 01:15:25,069
Why did they keep her alive?

1064
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:26,404
I can't answer that.

1065
01:15:26,487 --> 01:15:29,824
But if there's a chance
I can free her,

1066
01:15:29,907 --> 01:15:31,451
I have to try.

1067
01:15:31,534 --> 01:15:35,455
Even if it means endangering
everyone in this city?

1068
01:15:39,709 --> 01:15:41,419
I'm sorry, Neo.

1069
01:15:41,502 --> 01:15:45,173
I won't let what happened
to Zion happen to Io.

1070
01:15:46,966 --> 01:15:48,342
I hope you'll forgive
an old woman

1071
01:15:48,426 --> 01:15:51,512
for asking you to go
with Sheperd here,

1072
01:15:51,596 --> 01:15:53,097
till we have
better understanding

1073
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:54,599
of what's going on.

1074
01:15:54,682 --> 01:15:57,727
You're going to imprison me
after I just got free?

1075
01:15:57,810 --> 01:16:01,606
I know it doesn't seem fair,

1076
01:16:01,689 --> 01:16:04,484
but neither does growing old.

1077
01:16:04,567 --> 01:16:06,694
But you don't
hear me complaining.

1078
01:16:18,706 --> 01:16:20,541
Sorry.

1079
01:16:20,625 --> 01:16:22,668
I've never met
a legend before.

1080
01:16:26,047 --> 01:16:27,131
Neo.

1081
01:16:28,424 --> 01:16:30,176
Sheperd.

1082
01:16:31,552 --> 01:16:33,387
Crazy. You're real.

1083
01:16:35,348 --> 01:16:36,474
Real.

1084
01:16:37,558 --> 01:16:39,560
There's that word again.

1085
01:16:45,066 --> 01:16:47,443
People talk a lot
about the old days.

1086
01:16:47,527 --> 01:16:49,779
About you, the viral Agent.

1087
01:16:49,862 --> 01:16:52,490
The siege of Zion.

1088
01:16:52,573 --> 01:16:54,575
Everything was simpler
back then.

1089
01:16:55,576 --> 01:16:57,161
People wanted to be free.

1090
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:01,165
It's different now.

1091
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:04,710
Sometimes it feels like
people gave up.

1092
01:17:05,962 --> 01:17:07,672
Like the Matrix won.

1093
01:17:10,466 --> 01:17:11,884
This is you.

1094
01:17:15,888 --> 01:17:18,182
And I gotta ask you one thing.

1095
01:17:20,226 --> 01:17:21,936
Is it true you could fly?

1096
01:17:26,774 --> 01:17:27,775
Cool.

1097
01:17:58,306 --> 01:17:59,599
Morpheus.

1098
01:17:59,682 --> 01:18:02,602
General stuck you
in the Rapunzel tower.

1099
01:18:05,062 --> 01:18:06,564
On the upside,
it's a nice view.

1100
01:18:06,647 --> 01:18:08,733
What happened to Bugs
and the others?

1101
01:18:08,816 --> 01:18:10,526
They're supposed to be
sterilizing the Mnemosyne

1102
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:12,737
- with a toothbrush.
- Supposed to be?

1103
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:14,155
Well, I could tell you
that they're standing by,

1104
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:15,489
waiting for you
to make the choice

1105
01:18:15,573 --> 01:18:17,408
to remain meekly incarcerated

1106
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:19,827
or bust the hell out of here
and go and find Trinity.

1107
01:18:21,412 --> 01:18:22,497
But that ain't a choice.

1108
01:18:35,134 --> 01:18:37,261
General,
what should we do?

1109
01:18:40,681 --> 01:18:43,267
Bugs has the same
independence of mind

1110
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:44,810
she had the day you freed her.

1111
01:18:44,894 --> 01:18:47,897
This is not
independence of mind.

1112
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:49,023
It's mutiny.

1113
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:51,609
Come on, 'Be.

1114
01:18:51,692 --> 01:18:54,695
I know how much
you hated locking him up.

1115
01:18:54,779 --> 01:18:57,490
Just like I know
there's a part of you

1116
01:18:57,573 --> 01:19:00,618
that's relieved now
that he's gone.

1117
01:19:02,078 --> 01:19:05,915
We've worked so hard
to keep Io safe.

1118
01:19:08,668 --> 01:19:10,294
This scares me.

1119
01:19:20,846 --> 01:19:22,139
That's her.

1120
01:19:22,223 --> 01:19:23,349
On the bridge.

1121
01:19:23,891 --> 01:19:24,892
Got her.

1122
01:19:33,568 --> 01:19:35,820
It's sick
how the Semblance works.

1123
01:19:35,903 --> 01:19:38,656
You see flashes
of the real her, but...

1124
01:19:38,739 --> 01:19:40,366
the way she reads...

1125
01:19:42,076 --> 01:19:44,704
Code-wise,
she's pure bluepill.

1126
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:49,667
This is a tough question, Neo,
but it has to be asked.

1127
01:19:50,793 --> 01:19:52,962
What if she's happy
where she is?

1128
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:55,673
How did I read?

1129
01:19:57,758 --> 01:19:59,677
Exactly like her.

1130
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:05,683
Take us to broadcast depth.

1131
01:20:16,986 --> 01:20:18,446
Thank you for helping me.

1132
01:20:20,072 --> 01:20:22,074
Most of us are here
because of you.

1133
01:20:24,744 --> 01:20:25,870
I also admit our only chance

1134
01:20:25,953 --> 01:20:27,371
to get out
of the general's doghouse

1135
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:29,081
is for you to find your mojo.

1136
01:20:30,791 --> 01:20:33,377
What if I can't be
what I once was?

1137
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,547
Then we're all fucked.

1138
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:38,007
Two minutes.

1139
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:39,467
Two minutes to broadcast.

1140
01:20:48,642 --> 01:20:49,977
I slipped you in
through a hotel room.

1141
01:20:51,812 --> 01:20:53,272
Should be safe.

1142
01:21:04,075 --> 01:21:05,576
Portal's open.

1143
01:21:05,659 --> 01:21:07,787
Closest I could get you is
the warehouse near her garage.

1144
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:09,413
Whole zone's crawling with bots.

1145
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:12,333
Let's go.

1146
01:21:39,568 --> 01:21:42,696
So, what do you think of him?

1147
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:45,574
I was kinda worried at first
because he's so much older.

1148
01:21:45,658 --> 01:21:48,160
The beard, the hair...

1149
01:21:48,244 --> 01:21:51,664
- No, totally works for me.
- You idiot.

1150
01:21:51,747 --> 01:21:53,124
I mean The One thing.

1151
01:21:54,792 --> 01:21:57,753
You know, everyone that
shipped with him died.

1152
01:21:57,837 --> 01:22:00,631
Oh, yeah. He's gonna
get us all killed, for sure.

1153
01:22:06,011 --> 01:22:07,555
Predictable as ever.

1154
01:22:09,807 --> 01:22:11,559
Smith.

1155
01:22:11,642 --> 01:22:13,978
Smith? As in, the Smith?

1156
01:22:22,111 --> 01:22:23,404
This is so insane.

1157
01:22:23,487 --> 01:22:24,738
There's so many theories
about the two of them

1158
01:22:24,822 --> 01:22:26,490
and they're standing
right there.

1159
01:22:26,574 --> 01:22:28,159
This code is freaky!

1160
01:22:28,242 --> 01:22:31,120
He's like an Agent, but not.

1161
01:22:35,291 --> 01:22:36,876
An appeal to reason.

1162
01:22:41,088 --> 01:22:42,590
How did you find us?

1163
01:22:42,673 --> 01:22:45,593
You never appreciated
our relationship.

1164
01:22:45,676 --> 01:22:47,052
Not like The Analyst.

1165
01:22:47,136 --> 01:22:49,054
- The what?
- My doctor.

1166
01:22:49,138 --> 01:22:52,850
He used our bond
and turned it into a chain.

1167
01:22:52,933 --> 01:22:54,602
It's so obvious
once you see it, right?

1168
01:22:54,685 --> 01:22:58,105
But this whole altered-code
update really blew my mind.

1169
01:22:58,189 --> 01:23:00,191
I still don't know
how he did it.

1170
01:23:00,274 --> 01:23:03,068
You, as a balding nerd.

1171
01:23:03,152 --> 01:23:04,904
Hilarious.

1172
01:23:04,987 --> 01:23:07,364
And me...

1173
01:23:07,448 --> 01:23:10,117
even more perfect.

1174
01:23:10,201 --> 01:23:12,203
Maybe a little too far
on the piercing blue eyes.

1175
01:23:12,286 --> 01:23:14,205
What do you think?

1176
01:23:14,288 --> 01:23:16,248
What do you want, Smith?

1177
01:23:18,417 --> 01:23:20,711
I have such dreams, Tom.

1178
01:23:20,794 --> 01:23:22,505
Big dreams.

1179
01:23:22,588 --> 01:23:25,341
Well, mostly just extremely
violent revenge fantasies,

1180
01:23:25,424 --> 01:23:26,842
but in order for me
to pursue mine,

1181
01:23:26,926 --> 01:23:28,969
I need to dissuade you
from pursuing yours.

1182
01:23:29,053 --> 01:23:32,681
Sounds like conflict.

1183
01:23:34,391 --> 01:23:35,935
Inevitable?

1184
01:23:37,144 --> 01:23:38,479
Doesn't have to be.

1185
01:23:38,562 --> 01:23:40,731
All you have to do
is stay out of the Matrix,

1186
01:23:40,814 --> 01:23:42,316
and leave
the good doctor to me.

1187
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:44,735
You can have him.
I'm here for Trinity.

1188
01:23:44,818 --> 01:23:46,320
That's the trouble, Tom.

1189
01:23:46,403 --> 01:23:49,073
He knew you'd come,
just like I did.

1190
01:23:50,824 --> 01:23:52,034
Trust me.

1191
01:23:52,993 --> 01:23:54,537
You're not ready for him.

1192
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:57,414
Captain, I'm reading portals
from the lower frequencies.

1193
01:24:02,711 --> 01:24:05,881
I won't have his leash
on my neck again.

1194
01:24:13,347 --> 01:24:15,599
I found some
old acquaintances of yours.

1195
01:24:16,642 --> 01:24:20,020
Bugs!

1196
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:34,743
Exiles.

1197
01:24:34,827 --> 01:24:35,995
I thought
they were all purged.

1198
01:24:36,078 --> 01:24:37,580
You?

1199
01:24:38,872 --> 01:24:41,208
It is you!

1200
01:24:42,543 --> 01:24:46,130
All these years.
I can't believe it.

1201
01:24:46,797 --> 01:24:48,465
Oh, God.

1202
01:24:48,549 --> 01:24:52,511
You stole my life!

1203
01:24:57,266 --> 01:24:58,809
What the Merv is trying to say,

1204
01:24:58,892 --> 01:25:01,353
is that their situation
is a little bit like mine.

1205
01:25:01,437 --> 01:25:03,647
To have their lives back,
yours has to end.

1206
01:25:07,318 --> 01:25:08,402
Kill him!

1207
01:25:21,624 --> 01:25:24,084
You ruined

1208
01:25:24,168 --> 01:25:27,296
every suck-my-silky-ass thing!

1209
01:25:27,379 --> 01:25:29,965
We had grace.

1210
01:25:35,012 --> 01:25:36,555
We had style!

1211
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:38,641
We had conversation!

1212
01:25:38,724 --> 01:25:40,684
Not this...

1213
01:26:05,209 --> 01:26:08,754
Art, films,
books were all better!

1214
01:26:08,837 --> 01:26:12,049
Originality mattered!

1215
01:26:12,132 --> 01:26:14,051
You gave us
Face-Zucker-suck

1216
01:26:14,134 --> 01:26:17,596
and Cock-me-climatey
Wiki-piss-and-shit!

1217
01:27:03,726 --> 01:27:05,310
I still know kung fu.

1218
01:27:07,187 --> 01:27:08,188
Neo!

1219
01:27:37,885 --> 01:27:39,386
Just like old times.

1220
01:28:37,027 --> 01:28:38,070
Neo.

1221
01:28:39,988 --> 01:28:42,658
I've been thinking
about us, Tom.

1222
01:28:42,741 --> 01:28:46,036
Look how binary is the form,
the nature of things.

1223
01:28:47,287 --> 01:28:48,580
Ones and zeros.

1224
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:50,916
Light and dark.

1225
01:28:53,043 --> 01:28:55,087
Choice and its absence.

1226
01:28:58,465 --> 01:29:00,717
Anderson and Smith.

1227
01:29:37,337 --> 01:29:39,548
You've lost something, Tom.

1228
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:45,345
You're not
what you used to be.

1229
01:29:46,597 --> 01:29:47,681
It's true.

1230
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:03,030
- Nice one.
- Thanks.

1231
01:30:10,871 --> 01:30:12,080
Come on, Neo.

1232
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:39,608
Captain. You okay?

1233
01:30:39,691 --> 01:30:42,653
Yeah. Where's Neo?

1234
01:30:42,736 --> 01:30:43,862
Smith is killing him.

1235
01:30:43,946 --> 01:30:45,322
Where?

1236
01:30:52,829 --> 01:30:54,831
I feel bad about this, Tom.

1237
01:30:57,417 --> 01:30:59,544
After all, you are the one
who set me free...

1238
01:31:00,837 --> 01:31:01,838
again.

1239
01:31:03,882 --> 01:31:04,967
So, you, more than anyone,

1240
01:31:05,050 --> 01:31:06,677
understands why
I can't go back.

1241
01:31:09,262 --> 01:31:11,056
You should have
listened to me.

1242
01:31:13,266 --> 01:31:15,018
Now you'll never
see her again.

1243
01:31:28,615 --> 01:31:29,783
What was that?

1244
01:31:29,866 --> 01:31:31,243
That was Neo.

1245
01:31:32,869 --> 01:31:33,870
Mojo rising.

1246
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,380
You all right?

1247
01:31:43,463 --> 01:31:44,965
Yeah.

1248
01:31:45,048 --> 01:31:46,216
It's gonna trigger a response.

1249
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:47,509
I got multiple exits ready.

1250
01:31:47,592 --> 01:31:49,052
This is not over yet!

1251
01:31:49,136 --> 01:31:51,847
Our sequel franchise spinoff!

1252
01:31:58,895 --> 01:32:00,313
We should go.

1253
01:32:00,397 --> 01:32:01,565
I can't.

1254
01:32:01,648 --> 01:32:03,567
I have to talk to her.

1255
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:05,902
Neo, those Exiles
were older than you,

1256
01:32:05,986 --> 01:32:07,070
and we barely handled them.

1257
01:32:10,657 --> 01:32:12,200
You really wanna do this now?

1258
01:32:17,622 --> 01:32:18,832
I mean...

1259
01:32:22,836 --> 01:32:24,421
you look like shit.

1260
01:32:35,682 --> 01:32:38,226
Oh, my God. What?
What happened?

1261
01:32:38,310 --> 01:32:39,436
An accident.

1262
01:32:39,519 --> 01:32:41,855
Kush! Call a doctor.

1263
01:32:41,938 --> 01:32:43,482
It's fine.

1264
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:46,526
I don't have a lot of time.

1265
01:32:46,610 --> 01:32:48,320
I wasn't sure
I'd see you again.

1266
01:32:48,403 --> 01:32:50,989
After we spoke, I realized...

1267
01:32:51,865 --> 01:32:53,909
my life wasn't a life.

1268
01:32:55,368 --> 01:32:58,121
At some point,
I think I gave up

1269
01:32:58,205 --> 01:33:00,457
searching for something real.

1270
01:33:06,797 --> 01:33:08,090
Wait.

1271
01:33:09,549 --> 01:33:12,135
Something happened.

1272
01:33:12,219 --> 01:33:14,596
I looked for you
at the coffee shop.

1273
01:33:16,389 --> 01:33:18,725
I began to wonder
if I imagined you.

1274
01:33:19,893 --> 01:33:22,437
And then last night
I had a dream.

1275
01:33:22,521 --> 01:33:25,315
In the dream, you were
surrounded by police,

1276
01:33:25,398 --> 01:33:27,943
then they started chasing us.

1277
01:33:28,026 --> 01:33:31,029
- Us?
- You were on my bike with me.

1278
01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:34,574
How did it end?

1279
01:33:35,992 --> 01:33:37,160
Not good.

1280
01:33:39,704 --> 01:33:43,125
I've had dreams
that weren't just dreams.

1281
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:45,460
You mean a dream
that came true?

1282
01:33:53,135 --> 01:33:55,762
Finally, we can talk
like adults.

1283
01:33:57,430 --> 01:34:00,559
I hate lying. I do.
It exhausts me.

1284
01:34:02,352 --> 01:34:04,437
Tiff and I have been
waiting for you...

1285
01:34:04,521 --> 01:34:05,772
like, forever.

1286
01:34:12,863 --> 01:34:14,156
Deja vu, right?

1287
01:34:15,949 --> 01:34:18,118
Oh, no use.
You can't beat time.

1288
01:34:18,201 --> 01:34:21,913
This rewind is happening
faster than you can blink.

1289
01:34:26,793 --> 01:34:28,795
You gave me the idea.

1290
01:34:31,631 --> 01:34:34,926
Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.

1291
01:34:37,971 --> 01:34:39,097
Bullet time.

1292
01:34:40,932 --> 01:34:42,893
I know. Kind of ironic,

1293
01:34:42,976 --> 01:34:46,897
using the power that defined you
to control you.

1294
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:49,608
I kept such a close eye on you

1295
01:34:49,691 --> 01:34:52,235
and still you found a way out.

1296
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:54,696
Clever monkey,
using that Modal.

1297
01:34:55,655 --> 01:34:56,823
Call me an optimist,

1298
01:34:56,907 --> 01:34:59,075
but this could
all be for the best.

1299
01:34:59,159 --> 01:35:01,995
The skin's not looking
too bad this time.

1300
01:35:02,078 --> 01:35:04,706
I know some of this will be
difficult for you to hear,

1301
01:35:04,789 --> 01:35:06,249
after everything
you went through.

1302
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:07,709
All that pain and suffering,

1303
01:35:07,792 --> 01:35:10,629
only to learn the world
doesn't end when you do.

1304
01:35:12,172 --> 01:35:13,256
Surprise.

1305
01:35:19,262 --> 01:35:20,680
I was there when you died.

1306
01:35:23,183 --> 01:35:24,309
I said to myself...

1307
01:35:24,392 --> 01:35:27,604
Here is the anomaly
of anomalies.

1308
01:35:27,687 --> 01:35:30,482
What an extraordinary
opportunity.

1309
01:35:32,150 --> 01:35:33,610
First, I had to convince
the Suits

1310
01:35:33,693 --> 01:35:35,111
to let me rebuild
the two of you.

1311
01:35:35,195 --> 01:35:36,780
Why her? Getting there.

1312
01:35:36,863 --> 01:35:38,657
And don't worry,
she can't hear me.

1313
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:41,868
Resurrecting you both
was crazy expensive.

1314
01:35:41,952 --> 01:35:43,286
Like renovating a house.

1315
01:35:43,370 --> 01:35:45,622
Took twice as long,
cost twice as much.

1316
01:35:49,709 --> 01:35:52,170
I thought you'd be happy
to be alive again.

1317
01:35:53,213 --> 01:35:54,464
So wrong.

1318
01:35:56,258 --> 01:35:59,886
Did you know hope and despair
are nearly identical in code?

1319
01:36:01,888 --> 01:36:03,848
We worked for years,

1320
01:36:03,932 --> 01:36:05,559
trying to activate
your source code.

1321
01:36:05,642 --> 01:36:09,062
I was about to give up,
when I realized...

1322
01:36:12,148 --> 01:36:13,191
Trinity.

1323
01:36:13,275 --> 01:36:15,443
It was never just you.

1324
01:36:15,527 --> 01:36:18,613
Alone, neither of you
is of any particular value.

1325
01:36:20,323 --> 01:36:21,491
Like acids and bases,

1326
01:36:21,574 --> 01:36:23,952
you're dangerous
when mixed together.

1327
01:36:24,035 --> 01:36:26,997
Every sim
where you two bonded...

1328
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:29,165
Let's just say
bad things happened.

1329
01:36:31,209 --> 01:36:32,669
Neo!

1330
01:36:36,923 --> 01:36:40,302
However, as long as I managed
to keep you close,

1331
01:36:40,385 --> 01:36:42,053
but not too close,

1332
01:36:42,137 --> 01:36:45,348
I discovered
something incredible.

1333
01:36:45,432 --> 01:36:48,935
Now, my predecessor
loved precision.

1334
01:36:49,019 --> 01:36:52,689
His Matrix was all fussy facts
and equations.

1335
01:36:52,772 --> 01:36:54,524
He hated the human mind.

1336
01:36:54,607 --> 01:36:56,026
So he never bothered
to realize

1337
01:36:56,109 --> 01:36:57,277
that you don't give a shit
about facts.

1338
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:58,778
It's all about fiction.

1339
01:36:58,862 --> 01:37:03,533
The only world that matters
is the one in here.

1340
01:37:03,617 --> 01:37:06,619
And you people
believe the craziest shit.

1341
01:37:07,162 --> 01:37:08,413
Why?

1342
01:37:08,496 --> 01:37:11,082
What validates
and makes your fictions real?

1343
01:37:12,042 --> 01:37:13,126
Feelings.

1344
01:37:14,294 --> 01:37:15,754
Allow me.

1345
01:37:17,130 --> 01:37:18,798
Kush, here,
is one of my handlers.

1346
01:37:18,882 --> 01:37:20,216
They're everywhere.

1347
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:22,886
Such a pain, cloning Agents
over a coppertop.

1348
01:37:22,969 --> 01:37:25,430
Far more effective
just to saturate a population.

1349
01:37:27,349 --> 01:37:30,226
And, bonus,
swarm mode is sick fun.

1350
01:37:42,655 --> 01:37:45,784
Nicely done.

1351
01:37:47,243 --> 01:37:50,497
You ever wonder
why you have nightmares?

1352
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:53,541
Why your own brain
tortures you?

1353
01:37:53,625 --> 01:37:57,128
It's actually us,
maximizing your output.

1354
01:37:57,212 --> 01:37:58,380
It works just like this.

1355
01:37:58,463 --> 01:38:01,091
Oh, no!
Can you stop the bullet?

1356
01:38:01,174 --> 01:38:04,094
If only you could move faster.

1357
01:38:04,177 --> 01:38:06,721
Here's the thing
about feelings.

1358
01:38:06,805 --> 01:38:09,099
They're so much easier
to control than facts.

1359
01:38:10,058 --> 01:38:11,935
Turns out, in my Matrix,

1360
01:38:12,018 --> 01:38:15,480
the worse we treat you,
the more we manipulate you,

1361
01:38:15,563 --> 01:38:18,024
the more energy you produce.

1362
01:38:18,108 --> 01:38:20,318
It's nuts.

1363
01:38:20,402 --> 01:38:21,986
I've been setting
productivity records

1364
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:23,363
every year since I took over.

1365
01:38:23,446 --> 01:38:26,282
And, the best part,
zero resistance.

1366
01:38:26,366 --> 01:38:27,742
People stay in their pods,

1367
01:38:27,826 --> 01:38:30,912
happier than pigs in shit.

1368
01:38:30,995 --> 01:38:32,205
The key to it all?

1369
01:38:32,288 --> 01:38:33,623
You.

1370
01:38:33,706 --> 01:38:34,874
And her.

1371
01:38:34,958 --> 01:38:37,168
Quietly yearning
for what you don't have,

1372
01:38:37,252 --> 01:38:39,671
while dreading
losing what you do.

1373
01:38:39,754 --> 01:38:41,423
For 99.9% of your race,

1374
01:38:41,506 --> 01:38:44,175
that is the definition
of reality.

1375
01:38:44,259 --> 01:38:47,137
Desire and fear, baby.

1376
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:50,181
Just give the people
what they want, right?

1377
01:38:59,482 --> 01:39:02,527
She's the only home
you have, Thomas.

1378
01:39:02,610 --> 01:39:05,905
Come home before
something terrible happens.

1379
01:39:16,332 --> 01:39:17,625
- Bugs!
- I hear him.

1380
01:39:24,007 --> 01:39:25,175
Trinity!

1381
01:39:25,258 --> 01:39:26,968
- You shouldn't call me that.
- I'm sorry.

1382
01:39:28,470 --> 01:39:29,721
I have to go.

1383
01:39:29,804 --> 01:39:30,972
But I'll be back.

1384
01:39:32,098 --> 01:39:34,392
Neo! Time to go.

1385
01:39:36,895 --> 01:39:38,605
- Sentinels?
- Worse.

1386
01:39:40,064 --> 01:39:42,233
General ordered me
to look after the ship.

1387
01:39:42,317 --> 01:39:44,194
So you shadowed us?

1388
01:39:44,277 --> 01:39:45,862
Check your long-range scans.

1389
01:39:45,945 --> 01:39:47,947
Squids are combing this area.

1390
01:39:48,031 --> 01:39:49,491
He's right.

1391
01:39:49,574 --> 01:39:50,742
You can stay here and die,

1392
01:39:50,825 --> 01:39:53,203
or come back
and face a court-martial.

1393
01:39:53,286 --> 01:39:55,288
And you call that a choice?

1394
01:40:02,504 --> 01:40:04,631
Sheperd should have
left you to the Squids.

1395
01:40:04,714 --> 01:40:08,092
I'm too damn old to sit
through some boring-ass trial.

1396
01:40:08,176 --> 01:40:09,385
Niobe, don't blame Bugs.

1397
01:40:09,469 --> 01:40:11,387
Do shut your mouth.

1398
01:40:11,471 --> 01:40:13,765
Do address me as General.

1399
01:40:13,848 --> 01:40:18,102
And do not rob
my ex-captain of her agency,

1400
01:40:18,186 --> 01:40:20,188
which she exercised
with her own

1401
01:40:20,271 --> 01:40:23,775
particular brand
of shortsighted stupidity.

1402
01:40:25,026 --> 01:40:26,110
Shortsighted?

1403
01:40:27,779 --> 01:40:31,741
You care more about growing fruit
than freeing minds.

1404
01:40:31,824 --> 01:40:34,327
We are not going
to have this argument again.

1405
01:40:34,410 --> 01:40:36,746
It's not an argument.
It's a fact.

1406
01:40:36,829 --> 01:40:38,039
You gave up on people.

1407
01:40:39,499 --> 01:40:41,834
I tell you
what I'm going to give up on

1408
01:40:41,918 --> 01:40:43,002
and it's you!

1409
01:40:45,421 --> 01:40:47,340
Sheperd, get her
out of my sight!

1410
01:40:47,423 --> 01:40:48,550
General...

1411
01:40:50,468 --> 01:40:51,553
Disarm!

1412
01:40:51,636 --> 01:40:53,263
Kujaku's a friend.

1413
01:40:59,811 --> 01:41:01,437
Hello, friend.

1414
01:41:04,023 --> 01:41:05,024
Okay.

1415
01:41:06,359 --> 01:41:07,569
Him?

1416
01:41:14,492 --> 01:41:16,160
General.

1417
01:41:16,244 --> 01:41:17,537
Thank you for seeing me.

1418
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:19,414
I figured if there was anyone

1419
01:41:19,497 --> 01:41:21,791
who could make sense
of this mess,

1420
01:41:21,874 --> 01:41:23,668
it would be you.

1421
01:41:23,751 --> 01:41:24,877
Hello, Neo.

1422
01:41:24,961 --> 01:41:26,796
I know you.

1423
01:41:26,879 --> 01:41:28,881
I tried to keep my eye on you.

1424
01:41:32,218 --> 01:41:33,469
Why?

1425
01:41:33,553 --> 01:41:35,305
We met a long time ago.

1426
01:41:37,015 --> 01:41:38,099
Good morning.

1427
01:41:40,893 --> 01:41:41,894
Sati.

1428
01:41:41,978 --> 01:41:44,480
My father knew
we'd meet again,

1429
01:41:44,564 --> 01:41:47,525
though he would have wished
for happier circumstances.

1430
01:41:47,609 --> 01:41:49,402
His inadvertent role
in what happened to you

1431
01:41:49,485 --> 01:41:51,738
was the greatest regret
of his life.

1432
01:41:51,821 --> 01:41:53,698
I don't understand.

1433
01:41:55,074 --> 01:41:56,743
My father
was the chief engineer

1434
01:41:56,826 --> 01:41:58,077
at the Anomaleum.

1435
01:41:58,161 --> 01:41:59,537
The what?

1436
01:41:59,621 --> 01:42:02,707
My father designed
the resurrection pods

1437
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:04,709
where Neo and Trinity
were imprisoned.

1438
01:42:06,753 --> 01:42:08,004
I'm sorry.

1439
01:42:08,087 --> 01:42:09,589
You knew what happened to him?

1440
01:42:09,672 --> 01:42:12,884
You knew that he and Trinity
both were alive...

1441
01:42:13,885 --> 01:42:15,178
and you didn't tell me?

1442
01:42:15,261 --> 01:42:18,181
There were times
I doubted my decision, Niobe.

1443
01:42:18,264 --> 01:42:19,891
But Io needed you.

1444
01:42:19,974 --> 01:42:21,309
This city needed to be built

1445
01:42:21,392 --> 01:42:23,436
for your people
as well as mine.

1446
01:42:24,604 --> 01:42:26,356
If I would have
told you everything,

1447
01:42:26,439 --> 01:42:28,608
you would have had a very
difficult choice to make.

1448
01:42:28,691 --> 01:42:30,276
My friends

1449
01:42:31,611 --> 01:42:34,113
let me make my own choices.

1450
01:42:34,197 --> 01:42:36,115
If it was a mistake,

1451
01:42:36,199 --> 01:42:38,284
you have my deepest apologies.

1452
01:42:40,370 --> 01:42:41,704
Why are you here now?

1453
01:42:41,788 --> 01:42:44,290
Neo's escape has
destabilized the Matrix.

1454
01:42:44,374 --> 01:42:45,625
The Anomaleum
draws its current

1455
01:42:45,708 --> 01:42:47,043
from Trinity alone now.

1456
01:42:47,126 --> 01:42:49,295
A fail-safe has been
triggered to reset

1457
01:42:49,379 --> 01:42:51,381
the Matrix back
to the previous version.

1458
01:42:51,464 --> 01:42:53,257
But The Analyst
halted the reset.

1459
01:42:53,341 --> 01:42:54,634
He's convinced the authorities

1460
01:42:54,717 --> 01:42:56,678
that you will soon
return voluntarily.

1461
01:42:57,804 --> 01:42:59,722
And why would he say that?

1462
01:42:59,806 --> 01:43:02,892
Because if I don't go back,
he'll kill Trinity.

1463
01:43:05,645 --> 01:43:08,022
Faced with returning
to your pod

1464
01:43:08,106 --> 01:43:10,900
or enduring
Trinity's death again.

1465
01:43:10,983 --> 01:43:12,276
What would you choose, Neo?

1466
01:43:13,361 --> 01:43:14,654
I'll go back.

1467
01:43:16,364 --> 01:43:18,574
Well, The Analyst
knows you well,

1468
01:43:18,658 --> 01:43:21,411
but that knowledge
has made him incautious.

1469
01:43:21,494 --> 01:43:23,162
After you escaped,

1470
01:43:23,246 --> 01:43:26,082
he should have accepted his losses
and devacuated Trinity.

1471
01:43:26,165 --> 01:43:29,043
But that would have prevented
this extraordinary opportunity

1472
01:43:29,127 --> 01:43:31,045
that now exists before us.

1473
01:43:31,713 --> 01:43:34,632
A few hours ago,

1474
01:43:34,716 --> 01:43:38,010
no one would have been able
to convince me

1475
01:43:38,094 --> 01:43:42,390
that I would be standing here,
trying to explain a mission

1476
01:43:42,473 --> 01:43:44,434
as crazy as this one.

1477
01:43:48,229 --> 01:43:49,856
What are you doing?

1478
01:43:49,939 --> 01:43:51,482
- Volunteering.
- Oh, no.

1479
01:43:51,566 --> 01:43:56,112
You are the one captain
that I am ordering to go.

1480
01:43:56,195 --> 01:43:57,780
Now you don't
have to order me, General,

1481
01:43:57,864 --> 01:43:59,532
'cause I'm volunteering.

1482
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:04,454
I need two more.

1483
01:44:08,958 --> 01:44:11,794
Are you out of your minds?

1484
01:44:11,878 --> 01:44:13,755
You don't even know
what it is.

1485
01:44:13,838 --> 01:44:16,758
General, we know you.

1486
01:44:16,841 --> 01:44:18,050
If you say this is important,

1487
01:44:18,134 --> 01:44:20,178
none of us is
choosing to stay home.

1488
01:44:25,558 --> 01:44:26,642
Thank you.

1489
01:44:31,731 --> 01:44:33,733
Knuckle up, and good luck.

1490
01:45:03,763 --> 01:45:05,264
Trinity is held
in the Anomaleum,

1491
01:45:05,348 --> 01:45:07,099
which is in this
transmission tower.

1492
01:45:07,183 --> 01:45:09,435
The passages used
to rescue Neo are now sealed

1493
01:45:09,519 --> 01:45:11,729
and a legion of Sentinels
patrols the tower.

1494
01:45:11,813 --> 01:45:13,856
So, stealth will be paramount.

1495
01:45:13,940 --> 01:45:15,691
As long as we raise no alarms,

1496
01:45:15,775 --> 01:45:17,860
this first part of the mission
should be the easiest.

1497
01:45:17,944 --> 01:45:19,195
You mean
crossing the Fetus Fields,

1498
01:45:19,278 --> 01:45:21,030
sneaking across
an entire power plant,

1499
01:45:21,113 --> 01:45:22,532
climbing
a two-kilometer tower

1500
01:45:22,615 --> 01:45:24,450
guarded by thousands
of Sentinels?

1501
01:45:24,534 --> 01:45:25,701
That's the easy part?

1502
01:45:25,785 --> 01:45:27,453
Exactly so.

1503
01:45:27,537 --> 01:45:29,872
Because all we have to do
is convince someone

1504
01:45:29,956 --> 01:45:31,624
who does this every day

1505
01:45:31,707 --> 01:45:33,125
to take one of us along.

1506
01:45:56,649 --> 01:45:58,484
Fifty meters
below the Anomaleum

1507
01:45:58,568 --> 01:46:00,069
is a stratum
of amniotic filters.

1508
01:46:00,152 --> 01:46:03,573
Hidden along this edge
is a small hexagonal vent.

1509
01:46:03,656 --> 01:46:06,826
This vent feeds the air intake
into the corpuscular modifier,

1510
01:46:06,909 --> 01:46:09,996
which oxygenates
the bio-gel used in Neo's pod.

1511
01:46:10,663 --> 01:46:11,873
I get it.

1512
01:46:11,956 --> 01:46:14,834
The exomorph slinkies up
Neo's old umbilicus.

1513
01:46:16,085 --> 01:46:17,211
What could go wrong?

1514
01:47:04,091 --> 01:47:05,468
Once inside,

1515
01:47:05,551 --> 01:47:07,386
Morpheus will use
the System Operator

1516
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:09,805
to open the devacuator line
and disengage the macerators.

1517
01:47:13,893 --> 01:47:15,478
In order to unplug
Trinity's body,

1518
01:47:15,561 --> 01:47:17,772
while her mind still remains
connected to the Matrix,

1519
01:47:17,855 --> 01:47:19,482
I'm gonna need
a second human brain

1520
01:47:19,565 --> 01:47:20,775
to implement the bypass.

1521
01:47:20,858 --> 01:47:22,485
And since Neo
must be with The Analyst,

1522
01:47:22,568 --> 01:47:25,738
the only available mind
that's a near-enough match

1523
01:47:25,821 --> 01:47:26,864
is yours.

1524
01:47:28,407 --> 01:47:29,325
Figures.

1525
01:47:46,842 --> 01:47:47,969
Thanks, Cybebe.

1526
01:47:56,185 --> 01:47:58,187
Does Trinity still have
to take the red pill?

1527
01:47:58,270 --> 01:47:59,689
Since Kujaku and I
are transferring

1528
01:47:59,772 --> 01:48:01,065
her consciousness
onto the ship,

1529
01:48:01,148 --> 01:48:02,817
it's not strictly necessary.

1530
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:06,821
But what matters is that
this is her choice.

1531
01:48:06,904 --> 01:48:10,199
Extracting a confused
or an uncertain mind will,

1532
01:48:10,282 --> 01:48:11,659
in all probability, kill her.

1533
01:48:11,742 --> 01:48:14,286
But even if it is
what she wants,

1534
01:48:14,370 --> 01:48:18,040
won't The Analyst just order
the Sentinels to stop you?

1535
01:48:18,124 --> 01:48:19,625
He will.

1536
01:48:19,709 --> 01:48:22,169
But if my plan works,
it won't matter.

1537
01:48:22,253 --> 01:48:23,212
Why?

1538
01:48:23,295 --> 01:48:24,922
Because we'll already be gone.

1539
01:48:26,632 --> 01:48:28,551
Somebody thinks
this hard about a plan,

1540
01:48:28,634 --> 01:48:30,052
there has to be a reason why.

1541
01:48:32,263 --> 01:48:33,472
When my father realized

1542
01:48:33,556 --> 01:48:35,808
how the Anomaleum
was going to be used,

1543
01:48:35,891 --> 01:48:39,353
he covertly transferred
the designs to me.

1544
01:48:39,437 --> 01:48:41,939
The Analyst
discovered his betrayal

1545
01:48:42,023 --> 01:48:43,899
and had my parents purged.

1546
01:48:46,527 --> 01:48:49,530
I would have been murdered too
if it wasn't for Kujaku.

1547
01:48:52,575 --> 01:48:56,579
Not a day goes by
that I don't grieve them.

1548
01:48:56,662 --> 01:48:59,790
I've been praying for this day
for a very long time.

1549
01:49:07,882 --> 01:49:09,425
We're coming up on broadcast.

1550
01:49:12,011 --> 01:49:16,015
I thought you should know
that I'm here because of her.

1551
01:49:19,518 --> 01:49:21,896
All I ever wanted was to be
as fearless as Trinity.

1552
01:49:24,106 --> 01:49:27,526
But I saw how she reacted
in the garage, and I...

1553
01:49:27,610 --> 01:49:30,237
You're wondering if I'm wrong.

1554
01:49:30,321 --> 01:49:31,864
What if we're too late?

1555
01:49:33,657 --> 01:49:35,367
What if she's not
Trinity anymore?

1556
01:49:40,790 --> 01:49:43,542
I never believed
I was The One.

1557
01:49:44,418 --> 01:49:45,836
But she did.

1558
01:49:46,879 --> 01:49:48,506
She believed in me.

1559
01:49:51,175 --> 01:49:53,385
It's my turn
to believe in her.

1560
01:50:18,369 --> 01:50:20,287
This is
where it gets tricky.

1561
01:50:31,423 --> 01:50:33,843
Have you ever done
an operation like this?

1562
01:50:34,552 --> 01:50:35,636
Not yet.

1563
01:50:57,366 --> 01:50:58,701
Here we go.

1564
01:51:16,343 --> 01:51:18,262
Welcome home.

1565
01:51:18,345 --> 01:51:20,723
All I want is to talk to her.

1566
01:51:20,806 --> 01:51:22,433
Do you mean Tiff?

1567
01:51:22,516 --> 01:51:25,269
Come back, and you can talk to her
as often as you like.

1568
01:51:25,352 --> 01:51:26,729
I mean, handsome Chad

1569
01:51:26,812 --> 01:51:28,272
may have something
to say about it.

1570
01:51:28,355 --> 01:51:31,650
If she tells me
this is what she wants,

1571
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:34,028
you win.

1572
01:51:34,111 --> 01:51:35,237
Really?

1573
01:51:35,321 --> 01:51:38,073
But if she wants me,

1574
01:51:38,157 --> 01:51:39,992
then you'll let us go free.

1575
01:51:40,075 --> 01:51:42,828
And why would I do something
as stupid as that?

1576
01:51:42,912 --> 01:51:45,706
Right now, I'm on a ship full of people
who will unplug me

1577
01:51:45,789 --> 01:51:48,792
before they'll let you
take me back.

1578
01:51:48,876 --> 01:51:50,920
If you want this Matrix,

1579
01:51:51,003 --> 01:51:52,546
this is your only chance.

1580
01:51:52,630 --> 01:51:55,591
But how do I know
they won't unplug you anyway?

1581
01:51:55,674 --> 01:51:59,011
Same way I know you'll let us
walk out of here.

1582
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:26,288
Okay.

1583
01:52:26,372 --> 01:52:27,873
I like tests.

1584
01:52:28,749 --> 01:52:30,542
We'll let Tiff decide.

1585
01:52:47,893 --> 01:52:49,061
That's it.

1586
01:52:50,271 --> 01:52:51,814
Bypass is ready.

1587
01:52:51,897 --> 01:52:53,607
Now what?

1588
01:52:53,691 --> 01:52:54,942
We wait.

1589
01:52:55,025 --> 01:52:56,986
Doesn't it seem crazy
to come all this way

1590
01:52:57,069 --> 01:52:58,654
and leave her here?

1591
01:52:58,737 --> 01:53:01,407
We must abide by her decision.

1592
01:53:01,490 --> 01:53:03,075
And if she says no,

1593
01:53:03,909 --> 01:53:05,369
what happens to Neo?

1594
01:53:05,452 --> 01:53:06,662
At this time,

1595
01:53:06,745 --> 01:53:09,581
the most important choice
of Neo's life

1596
01:53:09,665 --> 01:53:11,166
is not his to make.

1597
01:53:42,197 --> 01:53:43,991
I saw this in my dream.

1598
01:53:45,451 --> 01:53:48,912
If I was the Oracle,
maybe I could explain it.

1599
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:51,165
The Oracle.

1600
01:53:51,248 --> 01:53:52,916
From your game?

1601
01:53:54,793 --> 01:53:57,046
It's not a game.

1602
01:53:59,173 --> 01:54:00,382
Oh, God.

1603
01:54:07,848 --> 01:54:11,268
After you left, I went home

1604
01:54:11,352 --> 01:54:13,062
and I played it.

1605
01:54:15,439 --> 01:54:17,900
I kept thinking,

1606
01:54:17,983 --> 01:54:21,320
why does this story
feel like a memory?

1607
01:54:28,494 --> 01:54:30,245
There's a part of me

1608
01:54:32,831 --> 01:54:36,043
that feels like I have been waiting
my whole life for you.

1609
01:54:39,004 --> 01:54:41,256
And that part is like...

1610
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:45,052
What the hell
took you so long?

1611
01:54:45,135 --> 01:54:47,179
I don't have an easy answer.

1612
01:54:49,348 --> 01:54:51,517
Maybe I was afraid of this.

1613
01:54:52,976 --> 01:54:54,853
Afraid of what might happen.

1614
01:54:56,355 --> 01:54:59,358
Afraid of hurting
the only person I ever loved.

1615
01:55:01,068 --> 01:55:04,613
I wish I was
who you think I am.

1616
01:55:05,989 --> 01:55:07,574
But look at me.

1617
01:55:08,867 --> 01:55:11,036
I can't be her.

1618
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:13,247
- Mom!
- Mom! Come on.

1619
01:55:13,330 --> 01:55:14,581
- Mom!
- It's Callie.

1620
01:55:14,665 --> 01:55:15,666
Is this real?

1621
01:55:15,749 --> 01:55:16,917
You have to come with us.

1622
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,377
Come on, we gotta go.

1623
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:19,962
Tiff, hey. Don't know
what's going on here,

1624
01:55:20,045 --> 01:55:21,380
but I'm glad we found you.

1625
01:55:21,463 --> 01:55:22,756
- She got hit by a car!
- I know, it's crazy.

1626
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:23,966
She was chasing after you.

1627
01:55:24,049 --> 01:55:25,384
They're casting her arm.
We gotta go.

1628
01:55:25,467 --> 01:55:26,844
Doctor said
she's gonna be fine.

1629
01:55:26,927 --> 01:55:28,720
You have to come
with us to the hospital.

1630
01:55:28,804 --> 01:55:29,888
It's too late.

1631
01:55:29,972 --> 01:55:31,181
I understand.

1632
01:55:31,265 --> 01:55:33,100
- Tiff, come on, let's go.
- Come on.

1633
01:55:39,606 --> 01:55:40,691
What's happening?

1634
01:55:42,776 --> 01:55:43,902
Neo was wrong.

1635
01:56:17,269 --> 01:56:18,353
Tiffany.

1636
01:56:21,940 --> 01:56:24,485
Tiffany, you have
to come with us.

1637
01:56:26,111 --> 01:56:27,488
Tiffany!

1638
01:56:29,781 --> 01:56:33,494
I wish you would
fucking stop calling me that.

1639
01:56:33,577 --> 01:56:35,120
I hate that name.

1640
01:56:36,622 --> 01:56:38,165
My name is Trinity

1641
01:56:38,248 --> 01:56:40,626
and you better
take your hands off of me.

1642
01:56:51,803 --> 01:56:52,804
Neo!

1643
01:56:53,305 --> 01:56:54,306
Trinity!

1644
01:56:55,474 --> 01:56:56,517
Oh, shit.

1645
01:56:57,809 --> 01:56:59,144
Get her out. Get her out!

1646
01:57:07,778 --> 01:57:11,073
Aye-yi-yi, what a mess.

1647
01:57:11,156 --> 01:57:13,825
I own that mistake.
Shouldn't have pressed.

1648
01:57:13,909 --> 01:57:16,912
Women used to be
so easy to control.

1649
01:57:16,995 --> 01:57:21,542
You know there's no way
I can let you two go free.

1650
01:57:24,962 --> 01:57:26,421
Cannot happen.

1651
01:57:29,591 --> 01:57:32,427
So, I guess it's deja vu
all over again.

1652
01:57:33,554 --> 01:57:35,347
She dies

1653
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:36,807
and it's all your fault.

1654
01:57:38,350 --> 01:57:40,936
Lies, lies and more lies.

1655
01:57:41,687 --> 01:57:42,896
Smith?

1656
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:44,106
What has the world come to

1657
01:57:44,189 --> 01:57:45,357
when you can't even
trust a program?

1658
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:48,777
How...

1659
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:51,613
Tom and I have more in common
than you know.

1660
01:57:51,697 --> 01:57:54,741
Once he got out,
let's just say,

1661
01:57:55,576 --> 01:57:57,369
I was free to be me.

1662
01:58:05,043 --> 01:58:07,796
- Yeah!
- Trinity?

1663
01:58:56,178 --> 01:58:57,346
You ready?

1664
01:58:57,429 --> 01:58:58,722
Yeah.

1665
01:59:40,806 --> 01:59:42,265
Oh, no.

1666
01:59:43,642 --> 01:59:46,019
Destroy her. Destroy her!

1667
02:00:02,994 --> 02:00:03,995
No.

1668
02:00:09,835 --> 02:00:11,336
Stop them.

1669
02:00:36,987 --> 02:00:38,488
You think this is over?

1670
02:00:38,572 --> 02:00:40,574
Lockdown. Initiate swarm.

1671
02:00:49,541 --> 02:00:51,877
Here, our unexpected
alliance ends.

1672
02:00:53,545 --> 02:00:56,173
You know the difference
between us, Tom?

1673
02:00:56,256 --> 02:00:58,133
Anyone could have been you.

1674
02:00:58,216 --> 02:01:00,260
Whereas I've always
been anyone.

1675
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:07,142
What just happened?

1676
02:01:07,225 --> 02:01:08,393
What?

1677
02:01:10,395 --> 02:01:12,981
Oh, no! Move! Move!

1678
02:01:13,064 --> 02:01:14,107
Get the hell out of there!

1679
02:01:17,986 --> 02:01:19,946
- How bad?
- Like, all the bad.

1680
02:01:21,239 --> 02:01:22,699
Yeah, this is bad.

1681
02:01:24,075 --> 02:01:25,702
I don't suppose
you can still fly?

1682
02:01:36,087 --> 02:01:37,798
Yeah, that's not happening.

1683
02:02:03,532 --> 02:02:04,783
Neo! Get on.

1684
02:02:13,458 --> 02:02:15,252
Calliope! Take the wounded!

1685
02:02:15,335 --> 02:02:17,379
Everyone else,
we stay with them!

1686
02:02:34,437 --> 02:02:36,982
- How is she?
- Life signs are good.

1687
02:02:40,819 --> 02:02:42,279
Her signal's strong, Captain.

1688
02:02:51,162 --> 02:02:53,206
Well done, Captain.

1689
02:02:55,584 --> 02:02:57,460
All we need is a miracle.

1690
02:03:25,530 --> 02:03:26,573
I hate bots.

1691
02:03:32,871 --> 02:03:34,706
- Get us out of here!
- I'm trying!

1692
02:03:34,789 --> 02:03:36,791
The lockdown is tracking.
Swarm is everywhere.

1693
02:03:36,875 --> 02:03:38,043
Never seen anything like this.

1694
02:04:23,922 --> 02:04:26,091
Seq, what is that?

1695
02:04:31,096 --> 02:04:32,222
What's wrong?

1696
02:04:33,932 --> 02:04:35,433
What are you...

1697
02:04:42,983 --> 02:04:45,026
He's turning bots into bombs.

1698
02:05:17,475 --> 02:05:18,685
Shit!

1699
02:05:18,768 --> 02:05:19,769
Lexy?

1700
02:05:34,159 --> 02:05:35,368
Sheperd's in trouble.

1701
02:05:38,455 --> 02:05:40,248
Jack me in.

1702
02:05:40,331 --> 02:05:42,375
I can get you in.
I don't know if I can get you out.

1703
02:05:48,339 --> 02:05:50,050
No!

1704
02:06:03,396 --> 02:06:04,522
What are they doing?

1705
02:06:08,568 --> 02:06:10,236
Herding them into a kill zone.

1706
02:06:43,311 --> 02:06:44,646
Captain, you gotta hurry.

1707
02:06:44,729 --> 02:06:46,981
Hang on, Lex.

1708
02:06:51,194 --> 02:06:53,029
Lexy!

1709
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:36,447
There they are!

1710
02:08:02,891 --> 02:08:04,058
Morpheus!

1711
02:08:07,937 --> 02:08:09,647
Lex.

1712
02:08:09,731 --> 02:08:11,608
- Bugsy.
- Hell yeah!

1713
02:08:12,567 --> 02:08:14,194
Seq, where's Neo?

1714
02:08:14,277 --> 02:08:15,904
It's bad. They're pinned.

1715
02:08:15,987 --> 02:08:17,071
Heading to a roof.

1716
02:09:26,349 --> 02:09:27,600
Nodal fibrillation
is critical.

1717
02:09:27,684 --> 02:09:29,102
She'll die
if we don't extract.

1718
02:10:10,101 --> 02:10:12,729
It's so beautiful.

1719
02:10:28,036 --> 02:10:29,746
I remember this.

1720
02:10:31,831 --> 02:10:34,042
I remember us.

1721
02:10:52,143 --> 02:10:54,145
My dream ended here.

1722
02:11:05,031 --> 02:11:06,616
We can't go back.

1723
02:11:08,743 --> 02:11:09,827
We won't.

1724
02:11:29,097 --> 02:11:30,473
Can they make the jump?

1725
02:12:01,546 --> 02:12:03,172
I'm not doing this.

1726
02:12:03,256 --> 02:12:04,632
Are you doing this?

1727
02:12:28,739 --> 02:12:29,824
Bye.

1728
02:13:50,863 --> 02:13:52,448
How dramatic.

1729
02:13:53,282 --> 02:13:54,575
Tiffany?

1730
02:13:54,659 --> 02:13:57,620
It was a private joke.

1731
02:13:57,703 --> 02:13:59,247
An amusement, that's all.

1732
02:13:59,330 --> 02:14:01,666
An amusement?

1733
02:14:05,670 --> 02:14:07,088
Kind of like that?

1734
02:14:11,342 --> 02:14:14,095
Okay.

1735
02:14:14,178 --> 02:14:15,638
If you hated the name so much,

1736
02:14:15,721 --> 02:14:17,890
why did you heel like
a good little bitch so long?

1737
02:14:21,018 --> 02:14:23,271
Yeah. Definitely asked
for that.

1738
02:14:28,568 --> 02:14:30,528
Can't you control her?

1739
02:14:36,367 --> 02:14:38,077
That was for using children.

1740
02:14:42,957 --> 02:14:44,458
We have a few questions.

1741
02:14:44,542 --> 02:14:46,377
You tried to activate
the fail-safe.

1742
02:14:46,460 --> 02:14:47,795
The Suits tried.

1743
02:14:47,878 --> 02:14:50,172
Obviously, without control
of your source code,

1744
02:14:50,256 --> 02:14:51,632
I knew that was impossible.

1745
02:14:51,716 --> 02:14:53,926
So, why haven't
the Suits purged you?

1746
02:14:54,802 --> 02:14:57,471
Because I know the system.

1747
02:14:57,555 --> 02:14:59,974
I know human beings.

1748
02:15:00,057 --> 02:15:02,226
And I know you.

1749
02:15:04,645 --> 02:15:07,189
Right now, you're feeling good
about what you've done.

1750
02:15:07,273 --> 02:15:09,692
You should.
It was a victory. Bravo.

1751
02:15:10,526 --> 02:15:11,861
Now what?

1752
02:15:11,944 --> 02:15:14,572
You've come here to negotiate
some kind of deal?

1753
02:15:14,655 --> 02:15:16,240
You think you hold
all the cards,

1754
02:15:16,324 --> 02:15:18,743
because you can do
whatever you want in this world.

1755
02:15:18,826 --> 02:15:21,162
I say, go for it.

1756
02:15:21,245 --> 02:15:23,831
Remake it.
Knock yourselves out.

1757
02:15:23,914 --> 02:15:25,958
Paint the sky with rainbows.

1758
02:15:26,042 --> 02:15:27,209
But here's the thing.

1759
02:15:27,293 --> 02:15:30,338
The sheeple aren't
going anywhere.

1760
02:15:30,421 --> 02:15:31,631
They like my world.

1761
02:15:31,714 --> 02:15:34,634
They don't want
this sentimentality.

1762
02:15:34,717 --> 02:15:36,636
They don't want
freedom or empowerment.

1763
02:15:36,719 --> 02:15:39,138
They want to be controlled.

1764
02:15:39,221 --> 02:15:41,182
They crave
the comfort of certainty.

1765
02:15:41,265 --> 02:15:44,018
And that means you two,
back in your pods,

1766
02:15:44,101 --> 02:15:47,647
unconscious and alone,
just like them.

1767
02:15:51,901 --> 02:15:54,612
We're not here
to negotiate anything.

1768
02:15:54,695 --> 02:15:56,947
We were on our way
to remake your world.

1769
02:15:57,031 --> 02:15:58,574
Change a few things.

1770
02:15:58,658 --> 02:15:59,867
I kind of like

1771
02:15:59,950 --> 02:16:01,285
the paint the sky
with rainbows idea.

1772
02:16:01,369 --> 02:16:03,287
Just remind people
what a free mind can do.

1773
02:16:03,371 --> 02:16:04,872
I forgot.
It's easy to forget.

1774
02:16:04,955 --> 02:16:07,375
- He makes it easy.
- That, he does.

1775
02:16:07,458 --> 02:16:09,669
Something he should
think about.

1776
02:16:10,670 --> 02:16:11,879
Before we got started,

1777
02:16:11,962 --> 02:16:14,799
we decided to stop by
to say thank you.

1778
02:16:14,882 --> 02:16:17,968
You gave us something
we never thought we could have.

1779
02:16:18,052 --> 02:16:19,428
And what is that?

1780
02:16:20,304 --> 02:16:22,098
Another chance.

1781
02:27:25,344 --> 02:27:28,138
Face reality, people.
Movies are dead.

1782
02:27:28,221 --> 02:27:30,140
Games are dead.

1783
02:27:30,223 --> 02:27:31,975
Narrative? Dead.

1784
02:27:32,059 --> 02:27:34,019
Media is nothing
but neuro-trigger response

1785
02:27:34,102 --> 02:27:35,312
and viral conditioning.

1786
02:27:35,395 --> 02:27:36,897
Wait, what are you two
talking about?

1787
02:27:39,149 --> 02:27:40,984
Cat videos.

1788
02:27:41,068 --> 02:27:44,821
What we need is
a series of videos

1789
02:27:44,905 --> 02:27:47,240
that we call The Catrix.
