1
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:33,199
Hans Jonas discussed the responsibilities
of modern science in relation to life.

2
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,371
I named this virus the Jonas Virus.

3
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,083
It is my responsibility to find a cure.

4
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,712
I will not give up.

5
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:28,546
I'M FUCKING SEXY

6
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,528
-Hey. Help me!
-Fuck.

7
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:55,824
Shit.

8
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,037
Damn it. Come here.

9
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,093
Ji-min!

10
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,594
-Stop her!
-What are you doing?

11
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,804
-Let go.
-What's with you?

12
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,180
Let go of me!

13
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,431
-Please come down.
-Don't.

14
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,226
I want to die! Leave me alone!

15
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,394
Don't be like this.

16
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,688
I don't want to live!

17
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,940
-Ji-min.
-I want to die!

18
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,694
Please leave me alone! Please!

19
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,821
Let go of me!

20
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,616
Please let me go!

21
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,912
My mom and dad both died.

22
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,209
What am I supposed to do alone?

23
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,632
Why would you die, you crazy idiot?

24
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,843
What's the use in living?

25
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,845
Still, you should live anyway.

26
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,972
I have nobody.

27
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,935
I don't have a mom or a dad.

28
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,064
I have nowhere to go
and no one waiting for me.

29
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,694
No one to scold me or praise me.

30
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,447
Do you know how that feels?

31
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,785
No, I don't.

32
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,954
So stop acting like you know everything.

33
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,165
Who are you to tell me to live?

34
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,959
Have you been in my shoes?

35
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,627
-No.
-Exactly.

36
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,047
Just leave me alone.

37
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:44,135
I almost always come last in every exam.

38
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,847
Well, not completely last.

39
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,102
Whenever I get my report card, my dad says

40
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,314
my grades won't shoot up
and get me into Seoul National University,

41
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,940
so I shouldn't bother having hope.

42
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,403
He says I should just
make sure I don't get hurt or sick

43
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,907
and to just be healthy.

44
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,700
I don't want to hear it.

45
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,702
I don't want to hear anything.

46
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,497
I didn't believe him.

47
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,459
He'd love it
if I got into Seoul University.

48
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,462
He was only saying that.

49
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,548
But…

50
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,345
there was something he said
that I did believe.

51
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,310
He said that if anything happened to me…

52
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,441
he'd be the first one there.

53
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,902
But he didn't come.

54
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:46,906
He didn't.

55
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,452
But who knows?

56
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,831
Maybe he can't come.

57
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,794
What if

58
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,796
my dad died?

59
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,217
At least you have hope.

60
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,012
I have nothing.

61
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,392
Is there hope?

62
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,275
Should I wait for my dad?

63
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,028
Or should I run away?

64
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,115
I don't know anything.

65
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,035
I-sak died, Gyeong-su died…

66
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,207
I wish no one else would.

67
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,751
What the hell?

68
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,670
Why are you crying?

69
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,589
Please don't die, Ji-min.

70
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,428
I wish no one else would die.

71
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,430
No one.

72
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,189
I want to leave.

73
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,485
I feel like I'll go insane in here.

74
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,196
Okay, let's go.

75
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,866
Let's leave.

76
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,161
I hate it here.

77
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,665
But how do we get out?

78
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,920
And we have nowhere to go anyway.

79
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,433
Ji-min. Sorry, but just a minute.

80
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,240
Gross.

81
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,202
Can't you people smell? It stinks.

82
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,662
Breathe through your mouth.

83
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,455
What are you doing?

84
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,501
I think we can get out of here.

85
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,673
This is where we are.
This is where Cheong-san is.

86
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:13,177
If we play music only on this speaker,
the zombies will go left.

87
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,179
Then we'll take the stairs on the right,

88
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,558
get Cheong-san, and go to the rooftop
using the center stairs.

89
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,226
The rooftop? Why?

90
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,770
Choppers keep flying around.

91
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,856
If we light a fire there,
they may come to save us.

92
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,735
Will the zombies really go
toward the speakers?

93
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,738
I think she's right
that they're drawn to sound.

94
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,908
That's right. They come running
whenever they hear us.

95
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,869
Can we just turn on certain speakers?

96
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,998
Yes. We'll turn on the ones
in the cafeteria, yard, and library, too,

97
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,666
and draw them there.

98
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,586
That's right. You were
in the broadcasting club in tenth grade.

99
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,755
Yes, because my mom made me.

100
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,257
That's all good, but

101
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,968
how can we play music?

102
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,637
There's no Internet so we can't stream.

103
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,558
That.

104
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,354
That?

105
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,609
This is ancient. Will it work?

106
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:42,933
Who wants to do it?

107
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,437
I've never done it before.

108
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,856
Somebody do it. Anyone.

109
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,359
I'll do it, then.

110
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,990
Cheong-san, are you there?

111
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,992
-We--
-What are you doing?

112
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,577
Check.

113
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,537
Cheong-san, do you hear us?

114
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,414
It's Su-hyeok.

115
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,627
We'll come to you so stay put.

116
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,878
Got it?

117
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,964
Don't come, moron. You can't come here.

118
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,342
I know what you'll say,

119
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,096
but we can't hear you from here.

120
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,472
Don't come.

121
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,975
So don't go anywhere. Wait for us.

122
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,230
You really can't go anywhere, okay?

123
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,317
We'll come now.

124
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,861
All good.

125
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,114
Let's get out of here.

126
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,282
The smell of poop makes me want to barf.

127
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,242
It's yours.

128
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,869
-It's not just mine.
-Yes, it is.

129
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,371
-Really?
-Yes.

130
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,081
These punks.

131
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,715
Cheong-san.

132
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,346
Please stay still.

133
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,142
I know you never listen to me,
but listen this time.

134
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,497
Why won't it work?

135
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,084
-Isn't it useless, then?
-That's right.

136
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,757
Time for meditation.

137
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:46,307
Once again, another joyful day
at school has begun.

138
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,729
Everyone, close your eyes

139
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,858
and calm your hearts.

140
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,115
-Broadcasting room first.
-Happy lives come from happy hearts.

141
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,370
Turn off the right and middle speakers.

142
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,372
BUILDING CENTER - RIGHT - LEFT

143
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:16,712
It sounds distant.

144
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,381
Yes. I only hear it from the left.

145
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,804
-They're going to the speakers.
-Really?

146
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,473
It worked, right?

147
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,939
Damn it.

148
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,195
ONE HEART

149
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,293
Bare-su.

150
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,795
Let's go.

151
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,508
-Hold on.
-What? Why?

152
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,393
There's one more.

153
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,686
What?

154
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,545
I'm really going now.

155
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:43,883
Let's go.

156
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,384
Walk slowly.

157
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,972
Check the left first.

158
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:57,938
BROADCASTING ROOM

159
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,275
Fuck.

160
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,776
Close it.

161
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,070
Close it.

162
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,408
Fuck, I could've been killed.

163
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,701
Asshole, you said it was clear.

164
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,787
-What? Why?
-There's still one left.

165
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,456
Look.

166
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,388
What do we do?

167
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,265
Is something wrong with him?

168
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,475
Not any more than you.

169
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,602
-Shut up, you prick.
-Sorry.

170
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,688
Everyone else followed the sound,
but he's still there by himself.

171
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,398
Maybe he's deaf.

172
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,818
Fuck. How could he hear when he's dead?

173
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,613
What about the others?
They all respond to sound.

174
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,115
Shit. Beats me.

175
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,117
Damn it.

176
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,244
How do we get out?

177
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,412
Hold on.

178
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,414
Let's wait a little bit.

179
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,876
I'll look.

180
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,586
Let's wait.

181
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:11,261
We are all beautiful.

182
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:19,228
We are in
the most beautiful times of our lives.

183
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,487
We can't wait any longer.

184
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,074
Take the others and walk past him
as carefully as possible.

185
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,785
I'll do what I can from behind.

186
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,373
Okay.

187
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,420
Let's go.

188
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:52,594
…will never perish
even when all else withers and dies.

189
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,055
Hold on tight.

190
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,558
Don't let go.

191
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:07,943
BROADCASTING ROOM

192
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,046
Run!

193
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,136
Damn it.

194
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,201
Lee Cheong-san.

195
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,876
ROOFTOP

196
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,336
Today will be another joyful day.

197
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,966
You moron.

198
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,094
You let this loser get you?

199
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,268
Thanks.

200
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,395
Of course. I saved your life.

201
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,398
Where's Cheong-san?

202
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,399
Cheong-san?

203
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,943
Why do you ask?

204
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:55,986
I want to kill him.

205
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,946
What are you talking about?

206
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,492
I'm going to kill him.

207
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:11,877
You're badly hurt.

208
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,087
Are you okay?

209
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,467
I'm good.

210
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,469
I'm so fucking good.

211
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,638
Where's Cheong-san?

212
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,806
Stop it.

213
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,520
You were always like that.

214
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,523
That's right.

215
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,069
"Do this."

216
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,112
"Don't do that."

217
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,323
Always ordering me around.

218
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,243
It's okay.

219
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,704
Since you were a better fighter than me.

220
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,667
But you can't do that anymore. Fuck!

221
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,013
You're nothing special.

222
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:36,962
Scared, right?

223
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,506
I know you're scared.

224
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:41,883
Hey.

225
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,344
Aren't you scared?

226
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,639
You crazy asshole.

227
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,143
You weak asshole.

228
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,868
You motherfuckers!

229
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,161
I said stop it!

230
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:28,972
Let's go.

231
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,228
Hurry up.

232
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,608
There's one coming. Run!

233
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,198
Hey, what's the code?

234
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,910
-Three-two-one-zero!
-Three-two-two-zero?

235
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,371
Three-two-one-zero, damn it!

236
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,664
Three, two, two…

237
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,292
It won't open! What is it?

238
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,628
-Three-two-one-zero!
-Damn it!

239
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,588
Three, two…

240
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,547
Mi-jin!

241
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,224
It worked! It's open!

242
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,600
-Come on!
-Hey! Hurry!

243
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,523
Hurry!

244
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,649
Joon-seong!

245
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,733
Help me.

246
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,151
Come on!

247
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,987
What are you waiting for? Hurry!

248
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,656
Hurry! Get in here!

249
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,117
Get in here!

250
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,544
I'm fucking tired.

251
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,589
-Damn it.
-Are you crying?

252
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,384
You're crying?

253
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,469
How humiliating.

254
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,473
What is this?

255
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,642
What the fuck happened to you?

256
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,436
What do I do now?

257
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,437
Let me see.

258
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,397
Were you stabbed?

259
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,192
Why the fuck did you get stabbed,
you moron?

260
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,656
Get the first aid kit.
I said get the fucking first aid kit!

261
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,658
Where is it?

262
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,580
Hey.

263
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:18,915
Where were you?

264
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,834
Cheong-san.

265
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,878
Where's On-jo?

266
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,380
On-jo!

267
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,968
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

268
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:31,720
Asshole.

269
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,223
How did you know I was here?

270
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,436
I told you not to go.

271
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,229
Why don't you ever listen?

272
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,191
Hey, save the lovers' quarrel for later.

273
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,484
Let's go.

274
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,528
-Where?
-We have to get to the rooftop.

275
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,697
-Before the music ends.
-Let's go. Hurry.

276
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,615
Wait.

277
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,909
Where's Su-hyeok? Su-hyeok isn't here.

278
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,454
-Hey. Where are you going?
-Hey!

279
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,770
Are you insane? Don't go by yourself--

280
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,439
-Go in! Go inside!
-They're coming.

281
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,691
Hurry!

282
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,278
The curtains.

283
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,038
There's a zombie there.

284
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,750
It's caught under the piano,
so it can't move.

285
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,804
We can't make it…

286
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,974
to the rooftop, can we?

287
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,894
We're trapped again, aren't we?

288
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,439
There are zombies outside, so…

289
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,442
Let's think a little.

290
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,527
This is so annoying.

291
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,954
Hey.

292
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:22,706
Hey, Prez.

293
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,293
Were you bit?

294
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,169
That's a bite mark, right?

295
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,852
Don't push, jerk!

296
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,564
Can't you see we're all in line?

297
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,400
We're all waiting!

298
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,993
I'm sick of this food.

299
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,162
I can't eat pork. Is there anything else?

300
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,039
-Hey!
-Take it and go!

301
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,832
-Hold on.
-Get out.

302
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,751
I can't eat pork!

303
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,170
-Give it a rest!
-That's enough!

304
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,755
Do you think this is your home?

305
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,228
I'm okay.
Are our phones still not working?

306
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,940
No. They won't work here either.

307
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,194
Shouldn't an assembly member

308
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,364
be able to find a way out of here?

309
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,284
I know.

310
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,411
I've never been treated like this.

311
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,247
There's nothing
an assembly member can't do.

312
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,582
Don't be sarcastic.

313
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:52,629
I've never done
anything illegal or improper.

314
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,547
Then can't you do it just this once?

315
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,383
I really need to go.

316
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,843
Wait a little while.

317
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:03,223
Once we're tested, I'll get you a chopper
and send you to the school.

318
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,683
The test isn't the problem.

319
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,936
Even if we test negative,
we'll still have to quarantine.

320
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,897
It was nine days for MERS,
two weeks for Covid-19,

321
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,774
and three weeks for Ebola.

322
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,945
Then what? We have to stay here
even after we get tested?

323
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,531
It depends on the incubation period--

324
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,125
Please try not to leave leftovers,

325
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,502
and leave your empty food containers
by the door.

326
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,087
Wait.

327
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:37,966
Special Mission Unit?

328
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,135
I was a master sergeant.

329
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,011
Are you a senior officer?

330
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,223
He was also with Special Forces.

331
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,433
Nice to meet you, sir.

332
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,686
Sorry. I'd buy you a meal
if we had met outside.

333
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:50,979
It's fine.

334
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,065
How long are they considering
for quarantine?

335
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,442
We don't know.

336
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,651
Yes, you do.

337
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,652
We don't.

338
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,947
They don't know what this is,
so they don't know the incubation period.

339
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,367
From what I hear,
they're thinking a minimum of one month.

340
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,203
What? That means we have
to be here for at least a month.

341
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,955
Wait until you get tested.

342
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:09,956
Wait a minute.

343
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,751
Yes, sir.

344
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,668
Well,

345
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,754
I'm really sorry,

346
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,340
but I have to get out of here.

347
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:21,843
Sir.

348
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,430
Even judges and prosecutors
are standing by and waiting.

349
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,931
Connections don't work here.

350
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,851
I know. I'm really sorry.

351
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,729
-I sincerely apologize.
-For what?

352
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,780
What are you going to do?

353
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,702
What are you doing?

354
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:56,169
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I have to get to the school.

355
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,922
I said I'd follow the protocols
to help you.

356
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:02,425
In the past, there were too many lives
I couldn't save due to those protocols.

357
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,641
I'm going.

358
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:14,020
Please help them
so they are not punished too severely.

359
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,441
You created the mess,
but you want me to clean it up?

360
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,241
You're a mother as well.

361
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,660
And I'm a father.

362
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,212
Hey.

363
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,380
Why did you do that?

364
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,674
He tried to get up.

365
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,677
What should I do?

366
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,887
Don't even think about coming.

367
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,849
Stay after what I just did?

368
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:51,766
You…

369
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,301
We can't go this way.

370
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,900
There are no kids in school uniforms.

371
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,153
No one got out.

372
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,739
No one was saved.

373
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:51,743
No.

374
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,119
It's not what it looks like.

375
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,370
Move. Step back.

376
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,538
I'm telling you it's not.

377
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,583
Tell him.

378
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,001
You weren't bitten by a zombie.

379
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,094
Why won't you say anything?

380
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,055
It wasn't a zombie.

381
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,933
Gwi-nam bit her.

382
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,517
Who?

383
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,353
Gwi-nam. The bully.

384
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,271
-Yoon Gwi-nam?
-Yes.

385
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,192
Nam-ra. Were you really bitten by Gwi-nam?

386
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,154
Say it clearly.

387
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,739
It's true.

388
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,536
Gwi-nam was bitten by zombies.

389
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,334
What bullshit is that? Moron.

390
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,044
I saw him get bit.

391
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,797
If you get bitten by zombies, you turn.

392
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,674
-So if Gwi-nam bit her--
-You're wrong!

393
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,427
MUSIC ROOM

394
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,264
Gwi-nam wasn't a zombie.

395
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,643
He wasn't.

396
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,145
He spoke. He recognized me.

397
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,107
You saw. He wasn't a zombie.

398
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,029
Are you sure he was bitten by a zombie?

399
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,364
Yes.

400
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,367
Then I'll turn into a zombie too.

401
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:16,577
Stop that.

402
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,164
I…

403
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,252
Never mind. I'm leaving.

404
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,921
Thanks, Su-hyeok.

405
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,966
Hey, Prez.

406
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,307
You never call me by my name.

407
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,068
You're not one of them.

408
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,366
She won't turn into a zombie.

409
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,076
Don't you trust me?

410
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,538
I saw Gwi-nam get bit.

411
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,292
-It happened while we fought.
-I fought him too.

412
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,544
That's how I know.

413
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:24,854
See this?

414
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,817
If she turns, I'll throw her
out the window so she can't attack you.

415
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,196
So don't say anything.

416
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,990
-Su-hyeok.
-Don't say anything, asshole.

417
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,827
You don't need to do this.

418
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,872
You stay quiet too.

419
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,048
Don't come closer.

420
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,301
I warned you.

421
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:57,970
Screw you.

422
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,306
I warned you first.

423
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,183
Stay away.

424
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,434
Gyeong-su was enough.

425
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,437
I won't lose any more friends.

426
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,568
-Get out of the way.
-I said stay away.

427
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,862
I told you to stop it, fucker.

428
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,155
Get out of my way!

429
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,698
Stop it, both of you!

430
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,049
If I feel strange at all…

431
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,139
I'll make sure I die.

432
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,725
I'm sorry, but--

433
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,185
No need to be sorry.

434
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,481
I'm not sorry towards any of you either.

435
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,110
I'm sorry.

436
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,654
Su-hyeok.

437
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,532
Push me if I turn.

438
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:02,827
Hey!

439
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,222
That's enough.

440
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,433
She should've turned by now.

441
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,351
No.

442
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,562
She was bitten by Gwi-nam.

443
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,564
She should be fine.

444
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,900
He was bitten by zombies.

445
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,652
Su-hyeok says he wasn't one.

446
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,488
I saw it with my own eyes.

447
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,782
Su-hyeok has no reason to lie.

448
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,951
And I do?

449
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,661
Still, Su-hyeok--

450
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,663
I know you like him,

451
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,790
but this is a different matter.

452
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,587
Why are you bringing that up now?

453
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,007
Stop taking his side all the time.

454
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,969
I am not--

455
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,262
Yes, you are.

456
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,661
Does it hurt a lot?

457
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:31,040
I said we shouldn't come out!

458
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,959
I said we would all die!

459
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:36,545
We stopped the bleeding.
You'll be fine when you get to a hospital.

460
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:39,382
How can I go to a hospital right now?

461
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,633
Damn it.

462
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,468
Yes, you can. Don't worry.

463
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,513
It's all your fault. It's your fault.

464
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,515
Stop whining. You won't die.

465
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,063
Hey. No luck?

466
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,279
See? I told you it wouldn't work.

467
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,572
Stop it already! You're not dying!

468
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,683
Su-hyeok.

469
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,227
Su-hyeok.

470
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,897
I feel weird. I'm hungry.

471
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:42,945
Su-hyeok.

472
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,782
Why do you smell so good?

473
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,336
Nam-ra.

474
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,422
Su-hyeok!

475
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,780
Get out of the way!

476
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,823
-Don't do it.
-Move!

477
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,203
I told you to stop, fuck.

478
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,329
You moron.

479
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,629
Hey. Cut it out. Stop it already!

480
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,589
-Let go of me!
-They're going to come in!

481
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,383
-Let go!
-Don't do it!

482
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,802
-Watch out, On-jo!
-Get out of my way! Let go of me!

483
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,971
Stop it. Are you blind?
Can't you see Nam-ra?

484
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,891
She would have blood on her mouth
if she bit him.

485
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,649
Did you see it?

486
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,360
Is he bleeding? No, right?

487
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,237
She's right. There's no wound.

488
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,657
But if Gwi-nam bit her--

489
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,659
She's still fine so she's okay.

490
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,665
Put that down.

491
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,918
Stop being so stubborn.

492
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,509
Let go.

493
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,429
I got it so let go.

494
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,558
Why won't you drop that?

495
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,436
None of your business.

496
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:54,785
You're okay, right?

497
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,247
-Why are you taking my side?
-What?

498
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,624
It's weird.

499
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,127
You hated me.

500
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:08,883
I still do.

501
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,887
But what's wrong is wrong.

502
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:23,272
She seems fine. Let's…

503
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,274
She should've turned by now.

504
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,734
No.

505
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,742
I'm not okay. I wanted to bite Su-hyeok.

506
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,035
That's not true.

507
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,078
Stop that.

508
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,914
No, I really did.

509
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,750
I wanted to bite him.

510
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,627
What do you mean?

511
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,295
That's all.

512
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,549
I wanted to bite him.

513
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,975
I don't think I should stay with you guys.

514
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,478
If I hadn't come to my senses,
I would've bit him.

515
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,647
Hey, stop that. What's wrong with you?

516
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,151
I'll go.

517
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,528
Wait.

518
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,157
Did you see Gwi-nam get bitten by zombies?

519
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,659
How many times must I tell you?

520
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,410
Did you see him turn?

521
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,496
No, I didn't.

522
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,456
I was busy running away.

523
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,628
Su-hyeok, you definitely fought Gwi-nam?

524
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,172
Yes, I did.

525
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,468
There's no reason
for either of you to lie.

526
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,513
Maybe Gwi-nam was bitten but didn't turn.

527
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,849
In the movies,
there are people who are immune.

528
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,936
Still, she tried to bite him.

529
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,230
And she could have.

530
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,692
Regardless, she isn't normal.

531
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,902
I can't be with her.

532
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,028
Ji-min.

533
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,030
What? Am I wrong?

534
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,201
I don't know.

535
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,163
I don't know what we should do.

536
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,291
So? What do you want us to do?

537
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:06,792
Please.

538
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,673
Don't fight.

539
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,472
If I leave, it'll solve everything.

540
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:29,315
Don't go. Where would you go? Stop it.

541
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,232
Please.

542
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,738
Let's not let anyone else die.

543
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,788
Hyeon-ju and I-sak's hands

544
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,625
were very cold before they turned.

545
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,463
Nam-ra's hands are warm.

546
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,131
She isn't a zombie.

547
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,301
So let's just talk about
how to get to the roof.

548
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,094
-No.
-Ji-min!

549
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,262
No!

550
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,433
She may be fine now,
but who knows when she'll turn?

551
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,228
The rest of you say something.
This is wrong.

552
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,564
She said so herself
that she wanted to bite him.

553
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,775
She has zombie blood flowing in her veins!

554
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,319
Zombies killed my mom and dad.

555
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,113
My innocent mom…

556
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:34,546
Hey.

557
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,466
Give me your hand.

558
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,594
-What are you doing?
-Tying our hands together.

559
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,764
Stop it. Stop.

560
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,477
Stop it.

561
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,992
Happy? She can't go to you
even if she turns.

562
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,205
She can only bite me.

563
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,687
What do you plan to do?

564
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,813
I have to leave.

565
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,399
It won't take long on that.

566
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,616
I don't think it'll start.

567
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,745
Why are you so damn pessimistic?

568
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,914
The one earlier was in an accident.
That one's obviously fine.

569
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,459
How can two people ride that?

570
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,419
Three.

571
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,757
You're really taking the baby?

572
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,385
If we leave the baby here, it'll die.

573
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,227
Here.

574
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,437
Sit in the back

575
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,522
and beat up anyone who gets close.

576
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,192
I can't go. No way.

577
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,528
You bastard.
I'll report you for desertion.

578
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,406
Fine, go ahead.

579
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:29,328
Given the situation, the court will agree
these were extenuating circumstances.

580
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:32,080
-Court? Extenuating circumstances?
-Yes.

581
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,541
You're pretty smart.

582
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,460
Yes, I am. I go to Seoul University.

583
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,421
Okay, then.
I'll break all the windows on my way out

584
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,839
so that they can get in.

585
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,302
No!

586
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,017
Damn it.

587
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:53,685
Let's go.

588
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,355
A person should use his head.

589
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:59,483
We need to stay alive
to tell someone about the laptop.

590
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:03,487
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

591
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,282
-What's that?
-Help!

592
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:10,077
-Hey.
-Help!

593
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,036
Come here!

594
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,220
We should've just gone when we decided to!

595
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,431
Are you going
to save everyone in the world?

596
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,267
-Are you an angel?
-I'm a detective.

597
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,351
Damn it.

598
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,731
-Take the baby.
-Okay.

599
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,444
Are you okay?

600
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,280
Are you hurt?

601
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:48,949
Mommy.

602
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:54,204
-Mommy is over there.
-Where?

603
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:55,914
Where's your mommy?

604
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,252
Is…

605
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,753
is that your mommy?

606
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,006
The one wearing red?

607
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:13,682
Sir. I don't know how to hold babies,

608
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,310
but this baby keeps smiling at me.

609
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,145
-Wait a minute.
-What do I do?

610
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,607
Stay still for a minute.

611
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,541
Fuck.

612
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,295
What's wrong with this world?

613
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,447
It'll all be okay.

614
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,785
Hey. If she's immune,
does that mean she's okay

615
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,954
even if she gets bitten?

616
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,413
Probably.

617
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,874
Fuck. I'm so jealous.

618
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,002
But she still has zombie blood
flowing in her veins.

619
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,380
She isn't completely a zombie.

620
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:28,966
A hambie?

621
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,175
What's a hambie?

622
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:31,468
Half zombie?

623
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:32,427
What the hell?

624
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,887
It's like half-half.

625
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,305
Like half spicy, half fried…

626
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:38,266
-I want fried chicken.
-Stop it.

627
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,644
We haven't even had water for two days.

628
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,563
Is it true we'll die
if we don't have water for three days?

629
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,317
I don't know.
Don't talk to me. I'm hungry.

630
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:51,321
Dae-su, don't you want
that soda we had on our way to school?

631
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,367
-Aren't you dying for it?
-Yes.

632
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,454
I want Hot Six with Pocari.

633
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:05,168
I'll see your soda, Hot Six, and Pocari
and raise you an iced vanilla latte.

634
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,546
How could you think about food
with a zombie right here?

635
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,007
Stop it. Nam-ra isn't a zombie.

636
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:10,966
Hambie.

637
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,175
That's still a zombie.

638
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,969
Let's not do that among ourselves.

639
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,346
We're all we have.

640
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:20,183
She's right. Prez is better than Na-yeon.

641
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,769
Don't even say her name. She's subhuman.

642
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,565
Gyeong-su died because of her,
and Ms. Park…

643
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:27,649
That's true.

644
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:31,862
If it weren't for Na-yeon,
they'd still be with us.

645
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,448
That's right.

646
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,826
The PTA asked the parents
to send stuff before the competition

647
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,995
and asked my mom to send some chicken.

648
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:40,996
Chicken?

649
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:44,207
We would've seen it if it were here.

650
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,751
There's nothing here.

651
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:48,712
Hold on.

652
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,674
Fuck. Maybe it's in here.

653
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,092
Hey.

654
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,886
-What?
-We don't know what's in there.

655
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,055
We need to eat and survive first.

656
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,893
-Fuck. It's locked.
-It's locked, damn it.

657
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,272
Let's open it.

658
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,399
Find something to open it.

659
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,152
-Hurry.
-Look for something. Hurry.

660
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,290
What do you think?

661
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:28,210
-That wall is our only way out, right?
-That's our best option.

662
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,963
Security is insane.
We're completely trapped.

663
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,175
-Let's go over it.
-Are you sure? We'll be seen for sure.

664
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,719
That's the only way.

665
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:44,768
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

666
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,385
-What?
-Rope.

667
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,389
Drop me a rope.

668
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,146
-U-sin.
-Yes?

669
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,148
My God.

670
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,358
Stay alive.

671
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,694
What are you doing? Take me with you.

672
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:39,489
Captain!

673
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:42,993
Captain!

674
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:48,623
Freeze.

675
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,333
Freeze!

676
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,669
What are you doing?

677
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,548
Stop right there.

678
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,216
What the hell?

679
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,051
I told you not to move!

680
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,761
I'm on patrol, punk.

681
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,683
Which unit are you with?

682
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:07,726
Sorry.

683
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,311
Pardon?

684
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,080
It won't work?

685
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,458
Should we knock it down?

686
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,339
Damn it.

687
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,884
PTA DONATIONS

688
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,016
Hey. Take it easy.

689
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,610
Hey. Keep it down! Quiet!

690
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:01,613
Hey.

691
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,198
Stop it.

692
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:08,828
It won't work.

693
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:10,747
What a waste of energy.

694
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,967
Don't play any music either.

695
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:47,909
My mom and dad…

696
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,706
came to the school to save me,

697
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,084
but the cops…

698
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,130
and firefighters never came.

699
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,260
If anyone sees this later,

700
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,387
please punish

701
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,931
everyone who should have come.

702
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,727
Everyone abandoned us.

703
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:15,979
All of them.

704
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,191
I swear I'll make you pay.

705
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,121
Mom.

706
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:36,291
Dad.

707
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,255
I'll stay alive and get revenge.

708
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,260
I'll get revenge on the zombies…

709
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,806
and everyone else, Mom.

710
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,209
Mom.

711
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,294
Dad.

712
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,296
Hi.

713
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,885
I'm fine. The kids are really good to me.

714
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,305
Want to see them?

715
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:41,731
Well…

716
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:45,777
Mom, Dad…

717
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:50,031
I miss you.

718
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,201
I miss you.

719
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,496
And…

720
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,417
I'm so sorry.

721
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,302
Give it to me too.

722
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,189
Mom.

723
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,358
I want a raise in my allowance.

724
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,238
-Is it ready to go?
-Yes.

725
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:36,202
Music and lyrics
by intergalactic superstar Yang Dae-su.

726
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:38,371
Beat.

727
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:44,127
Chicken tastes better fried in olive oil

728
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,964
Pork tastes better than soy meat

729
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:51,259
Strawberry cake tastes better
Than plain strawberries

730
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:54,929
What makes me laugh, laugh, laugh

731
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,389
Is trans fat

732
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,515
Cheong-san?

733
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,324
Mom.

734
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:17,410
It's me.

735
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,913
Dad, you're okay too, right?

736
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,291
I'm…

737
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:26,544
I'm doing okay.

738
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:53,696
Hi, Dad.

739
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:55,907
You're okay, right?

740
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,744
I waited for you all night,
but you didn't come,

741
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:01,496
so we're trying our best to hang on.

742
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:07,043
You said being healthy is the best
even if I don't get good grades.

743
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,429
You said you'd come first
if anything happened.

744
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,142
You're okay, right?

745
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,736
You have to be okay, Dad.

746
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,573
You don't have to come save me.

747
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,831
But still, I wish you'd come.

748
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,839
I really thought you would come.

749
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:11,858
But I'm okay.

750
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,824
I only say this
when you give me my allowance,

751
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,078
but I'll say it for free today.

752
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:27,665
Dad.

753
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:30,501
I love you.

754
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,215
I love you.

755
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,387
I love you so much.

756
