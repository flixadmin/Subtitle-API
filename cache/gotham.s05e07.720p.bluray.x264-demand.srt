1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,116
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,680
You're the brother I never had.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,877
We will create a legacy
in this city.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,269
<i>Gotham falls,</i>

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,680
<i>we rise.</i>

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,120
Together.

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,470
<i>Poor Jim.</i>

8
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,640
All alone again.

9
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,757
- I told you to leave.
- I heard you.

10
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,200
<i>So many things
I wish I could change.</i>

11
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,316
Things I've done.

12
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,312
We're here now.
We'll try to put

13
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,834
the pieces back together again.

14
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,879
<i>Jim,</i>

15
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,880
I'm pregnant.

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,390
- This isn't you.
- We're not the same.

17
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,597
<i>That night that your parents
were murdered,</i>

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,879
<i>I didn't do anything,
because I didn't care.</i>

19
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,509
Everyone,
let's dig a little deeper.

20
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,951
'Cause that's the only way
you're all making it out

21
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,120
of this hole.

22
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,952
Deep enough?

23
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,480
You're leaving Gotham.

24
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,560
<i>There's nothing left
for me here anymore.</i>

25
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,670
<i>I've done all I can.</i>

26
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
I want in.

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,152
<i>I love family reunions.</i>

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,556
Don't you?

29
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,880
Go. Go, go.

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,240
- Which way?
- Wait.

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
General,

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,879
you were the ones
who let Walker operate

33
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,315
right under your noses.

34
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,713
Now you're telling me
she evaded capture?

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,593
I understand your frustration.

36
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,276
Have you at least determined
why she did what she did?

37
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,920
Not yet.

38
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,720
Look, bottom line,

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,197
Walker and Dorrance
are out of the picture.

40
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,597
What else is standing in the way
of reunification?

41
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,760
Nothing.

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,309
I'm recommending we begin
the process immediately.

43
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,515
There have been a lot of
promises from across the river.

44
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,791
But unlike Walker,
or whoever she is,

45
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,713
I have the authority
to take action.

46
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,714
Unless something happens
to destabilize Gotham again,

47
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,712
this nightmare is about to end.

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,720
<i>Think he's for real?</i>

49
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,280
I'll believe it
when it happens.

50
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,397
I take it your search party
didn't find Alfred.

51
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,829
Neither hide nor hair.

52
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,154
Pennyworth vanished
five days ago.

53
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,320
It ain't looking good.

54
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,640
How's Bruce?

55
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,750
He's been pulling double shifts
on the search parties.

56
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,953
Kid's dead on his feet.

57
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,640
I want to search
this area next.

58
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,136
There are whole blocks
of abandoned buildings.

59
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,936
- I'll get a squad right on it.
- Just give me five minutes.

60
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,235
- I'll be ready.
- No.

61
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,680
You're not going out.

62
00:02:56,681 --> 00:02:58,353
- No, Jim...
- You need your rest.

63
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,320
I'm not cutting you out,
but I need you sharp,

64
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,589
not a liability.

65
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,231
I just don't understand
what could have happened.

66
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,556
Neither do I.

67
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,616
But I know
that Alfred Pennyworth

68
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,994
can take care of himself.

69
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,234
I'll send for you
if I hear anything.

70
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,079
Kid's tough.

71
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Yeah.

72
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,198
In other good-ish news,
Harper radioed.

73
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,430
Her squad
found something.

74
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
What?

75
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,516
It's weird.

76
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,120
Four men.

77
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,896
Looks like they breathed in
some sort of chemical agent.

78
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,036
I'm thinking airborne.

79
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,120
And the Z's on their bodies?

80
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,079
Carved into them
before time of death.

81
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,755
Check out the mustache.

82
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,114
- Fake.
- Seems like

83
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,794
they escaped from here.

84
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,876
A film set?

85
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,236
I said it was weird.

86
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,993
Zs on their chests.

87
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,159
Think it could be Zsasz?

88
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,119
Chemicals aren't
really his MO.

89
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,749
Plus, I never figured Zsasz
for much of a cinephile.

90
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,560
But whoever it is, if they
have more of these chemicals

91
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,670
and the will
to use them...

92
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,320
It's bye-bye, reunification.

93
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,039
Got to stop him before news
reaches the mainland.

94
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
The Chessmen.

95
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,256
That's a gang
that operates out

96
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,816
of the Narrows. What the
hell is a Narrows gang

97
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,956
doing way up here?

98
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,720
I think we both know
someone we can ask.

99
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,976
Can you check on the fever
in Bed 12?

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,116
What's up, Doc?

101
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,557
Heard you were working
here. Interesting.

102
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,154
It's what I do,
help people.

103
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,516
Speaking of which,
I've got patients.

104
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,070
Oh, you wouldn't kick
Jim's baby mama to the curb,

105
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,357
- now, would you?
- Whatever happened between you

106
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,113
and Jim,
it's none of my concern.

107
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,336
So if you're here to gloat...

108
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,874
I'm here for
medical assistance.

109
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,909
For my little nugget.

110
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
What do you say?

111
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,559
Be my O.B.?

112
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,829
You can't be serious.

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,434
I know we've had
our differences.

114
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,319
You tried
to kill me, Barbara.

115
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
Twice.

116
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,953
That was years ago.

117
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,349
There are other doctors here.

118
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,835
Not as good as you.

119
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
Look,

120
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,954
whatever you think
of me, my child

121
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,759
is innocent,
and I want the best for it.

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,719
And in this place,
that means you.

123
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,640
Does Jim know you're here?

124
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,520
This is none of his business.

125
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Lee?

126
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Jim.

127
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,079
- Barbara.
- You're interrupting.

128
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,272
Doctor-patient. Blow.

129
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,715
I'm sorry,
you're her doctor?

130
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,070
No. I don't know.

131
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,432
Maybe.
What are you doing here?

132
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Some bodies turned up.

133
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,200
They might have
a Narrows connection.

134
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,556
I wouldn't have
come, but...

135
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,240
It's important. Right.

136
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,513
You two need to talk.
I'll be outside.

137
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,816
- Uh, I'd rather not.
- If you want me to be your doctor,

138
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,560
you will talk
to the baby's... father.

139
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,616
Your first appointment is next
week. The nurse will give you

140
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,896
all your vitamins
when you leave.

141
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Deal?

142
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,376
Is she really
the only one you could find?

143
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,392
She's the best doctor in
this hellhole of a city.

144
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,960
Not everything is
about Jim Gordon.

145
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Pretty sure this one is.

146
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,759
Because we slept
together. Yeah.

147
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,616
I only told you because I felt
you had a right to know.

148
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,154
But your involvement
in this ended

149
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,118
the moment you put
your pants back on.

150
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,076
What?

151
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,616
You don't think I'm
fit to be a mother?

152
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,710
What do you think?

153
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,670
Barbara.

154
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,315
Who are you?

155
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,513
Well, look who decided
to join us.

156
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,756
Hello, champ.

157
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,190
Master Bruce!

158
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,710
Alfred, how did you...

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,275
Look at the state of you.

160
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,711
What have I told you about
rolling around in the muck?

161
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,117
Alfred, what's going on?

162
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Who are these people?

163
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,754
Whatever do
you mean, Bruce?

164
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,394
We're your parents.

165
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,840
Right. Well,
let's get you spruced up.

166
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
After all,

167
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,435
we have a guest.

168
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,396
Welcome home, Bruce.

169
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,398
Jeremiah.
You're alive.

170
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,873
Well, you
didn't think Selina

171
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,872
could kill me so
easily, did you?

172
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,431
I just had
to put you off my scent

173
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,439
until I could finalize
my... project.

174
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,673
Manners,
Master Bruce.

175
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,360
Let's not be rude
to our guest.

176
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,950
Especially when I
come bearing gifts.

177
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,350
Oh, Mr. Jeremiah. A cake.

178
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,120
How exceedingly kind
of you.

179
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,275
Is it Italian meringue?

180
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Sure.

181
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
Oh.

182
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,274
Now, now, Bruce,
you come

183
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,352
any closer
and I blow up Wayne Manor,

184
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,874
with all of us inside of it.

185
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,037
I have a dozen
more of these, uh,

186
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,116
Italian meringues sprinkled
all throughout the house.

187
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,873
What did you do to Alfred?

188
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,994
And who are these people?

189
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,355
Ah, glad you asked.

190
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,520
Mm, come.

191
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,876
Come, come.

192
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,150
Mommy and Daddy dearest

193
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,310
were just an innocent couple
I kidnapped based on...

194
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,196
bone structure and, um...

195
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
build.

196
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,589
Just a touch

197
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,514
of plastic surgery,
and voilà...

198
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Waynes.

199
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,437
Alfred I nabbed
in the Green Zone.

200
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,480
They're hypnotized.

201
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,199
Well, I'm afraid
there was no room

202
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,794
for improv in
our script.

203
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,480
Today is a...

204
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,195
<i>very</i> important day, Bruce.

205
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,595
Just look at the way
they're dressed.

206
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,152
It's the night
my parents were killed.

207
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,355
And I'm giving
you the chance

208
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,513
to experience it
all over again.

209
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Why?

210
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,560
Isn't it
obvious?

211
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,076
Bruce...

212
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,676
this...

213
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,391
this was the most important day
of your life.

214
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,956
And I didn't get to be
a part of it.

215
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,753
We need to
rectify that.

216
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,276
Alfred. It's
time for dinner.

217
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,720
Chop-chop.
We're on a very tight schedule.

218
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,992
Of course,
Mr. Jeremiah.

219
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,752
That's zero for three.

220
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,040
Yes.

221
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,960
It seems the government
was quite thorough

222
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,151
- when they mined the river.
- You didn't have a plan

223
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,074
to get off this rock <i>before</i>
you stole everyone's crap?

224
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,995
I was working on a plan.

225
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,953
The river is mined.

226
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,840
Everything that flies out
gets blown from... the...

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,878
- sky.
- What?

228
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,758
Jeremiah was digging a
tunnel under the river.

229
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
A tunnel?

230
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,873
Really?

231
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,351
Do you have any better ideas?

232
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,760
Didn't think so.

233
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,075
It's in the Dark Zone.

234
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,360
We should wait until
night to check it out.

235
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,354
Well, I was running out
of guinea pigs anyway.

236
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Oh, look!

237
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,595
He's swimming to shore.

238
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,199
<i>Are you sure</i>

239
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,953
you should be out
in the Narrows alone?

240
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,396
When the bridges fell, this
place descended into chaos.

241
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,496
Figure our best bet of
getting out in one piece is

242
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,376
- to keep a low profile.
- So all the work I did to make the Narrows better

243
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,914
was for nothing.

244
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,717
It's the Leopards.
Rivals of the Chessmen.

245
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,359
About this Barbara thing...

246
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,476
Uh, Jim, just don't.

247
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,836
No, it's important to me
that you understand.

248
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,671
Okay. So, what
are you gonna do?

249
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,757
I don't know,
but it's my child, too.

250
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,511
Barbara seems to have a
difference of opinion.

251
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,470
But hey, people change.

252
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,360
You don't know her
like I do.

253
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,590
You can say that again.

254
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Look.

255
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
We're clear.

256
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,234
The Chessmen moved around.

257
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,160
They used these as signals
for their members.

258
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,840
The rook's a compass needle.

259
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,793
North-northeast.
Let's go.

260
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Hmm.

261
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,830
Alfred told me
such great tidbits

262
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,315
about your childhood.

263
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,672
How you used to eat here,

264
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,634
in the kitchen, when it was
just you and the family.

265
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,679
My, how...

266
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,231
homey and intimate.

267
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,236
Grilled cheese and Branston
pickle sandwich, Mr. Jeremiah.

268
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,675
Master Bruce's favorite.

269
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,232
My influence,
though Thomas did add a dash

270
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,557
of aioli for extra flair.

271
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,713
Oh. Come on, Bruce.

272
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,600
That's a weird favorite
food for a 12-year-old.

273
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,633
I'm playing your game.

274
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,153
Now let Alfred
and these people go.

275
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,390
They're innocent.

276
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,072
I'm sorry, Bruce,
it's just...

277
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,870
it's very important
to me that I get

278
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,192
every detail
exactly right.

279
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,714
Speaking of which...

280
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,440
the final touch.

281
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,199
What was it like...

282
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,277
losing your parents
that night?

283
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,474
I lost my family,
too, Bruce.

284
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,757
The wound still
hasn't healed.

285
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,640
I... think about it often.

286
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,474
None of this is real.

287
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,071
You're trying
to manipulate me.

288
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,472
It will never be real.

289
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,671
But you are thinking
about that night.

290
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,113
That's all I need.

291
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,272
I just want to be
connected to you.

292
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,632
I offered for you
to be my best friend!

293
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,036
But I've realized
if we...

294
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,630
can't be friends...

295
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,912
then we <i>can</i> be connected
in other ways.

296
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,635
How?

297
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,600
You'll see.

298
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,960
In time.

299
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Hmm.

300
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,676
I'm sorry to cut
tonight short...

301
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
but...

302
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,756
your parents and I have
a very important date...

303
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,839
Jeremiah.

304
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,593
- ...with destiny.
- Jeremiah!

305
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,038
You might want to find your
faithful butler and leave.

306
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,840
Quickly.

307
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Alfred!

308
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,560
The signs lead
this way.

309
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,676
Look at the smoke.

310
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,952
Someone restarted production.

311
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,400
My God, Jim...

312
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,235
look at all of this.

313
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Come on.

314
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,197
- Who's in charge here?
- Tick tock,

315
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
the chemical stock,

316
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,238
shall give our Gotham
an aftershock.

317
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,394
Tick tock, the chemical stock,

318
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,240
shall give our Gotham
an aftershock.

319
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,357
Tick tock,
the chemical stock...

320
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,392
...shall give our Gotham
an aftershock.

321
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,670
They've been
hypnotized.

322
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Tetch.

323
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,616
Tick tock,

324
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,915
the chemical stock

325
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,080
shall give our Gotham
an aftershock.

326
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,591
My, my, what a thrill.

327
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,595
Jim Gordon...

328
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,920
and the woman
he told me to kill.

329
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,918
Brings back memories.

330
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,795
That tea party,
so long ago.

331
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,354
But now, to order these men
to attack my foe!

332
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,193
All for one, and one for all!

333
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,192
Ain't this a grand old ball!

334
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
Yoo-hoo!

335
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
Jim!

336
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,554
Ain't this...

337
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,793
some... game!

338
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,515
Give it to me again?

339
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,193
Penguin
has been stealing

340
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,477
everything in the city
that's not nailed down,

341
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,115
and now he needs a way
of getting it off the island.

342
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,835
Hmm. And you're
helping him?

343
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,560
Well, that's what he thinks.

344
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,632
Barbara, Tabitha
was my friend, too.

345
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,873
If anything,
I want to gut the twerp...

346
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,040
- and take his loot.
- Except you don't actually have

347
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,430
- a way out of Gotham.
- I'll find one tonight.

348
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,478
I'll still need your help
moving the stuff.

349
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,433
We can get out of here together.

350
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,794
Away from Jim Gordon.

351
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,920
Rich as Midas.

352
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,719
Penguin dead in a ditch.

353
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,076
Well, aren't we just
two single ladies and a baby

354
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,630
about to kill
our sworn enemy together.

355
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
What?

356
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,040
It's just you're pregnant.

357
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,800
Don't even start.

358
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,560
Alfred!

359
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
Alfred!

360
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,554
Alfred. We need to get out of here.

361
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,680
Ah, Master Bruce. I was
just taking a quiet moment

362
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,154
- to tidy up.
- We need to go.

363
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,238
- The bombs.
- What bombs?

364
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,830
These bombs.

365
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,909
No need for roughhousing, sir.

366
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,240
There has to be a way.

367
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,136
Alfred, you'd do anything
to protect me, right?

368
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,119
- Absolutely, sir.
- There's a gas leak. In the kitchen.

369
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,496
It's only a matter of time
before this whole place goes up.

370
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,398
A gas leak?
Where are your parents?

371
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,336
- Where's our guest?
- I've already warned them.

372
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,635
I know a way out.
Come on!

373
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,510
Alfred!

374
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Alfred.

375
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,316
Oh, bloody hell.

376
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
Don't move.

377
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,876
Do you, uh...?

378
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,152
Oh, yeah, I remember everything.

379
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,996
Clear as day.

380
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,736
And let me tell you,
if ever I see

381
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,320
that Jervis Tetch character
again I'll stick that watch

382
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,678
so far up his... his nose.

383
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,230
How about you?

384
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,310
You all right?

385
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,280
Yeah, I'm all right.

386
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,914
But the manor...

387
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,117
Don't you worry about that now,
son.

388
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,990
Come on. Help me up.

389
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,120
Oh, your leg's hurt.

390
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,279
Yes, but it's not broken.

391
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,400
I thought I lost you.

392
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,240
Me?

393
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,752
Never, Master Bruce.

394
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,716
Go on.

395
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,560
You know where
he's gonna be at.

396
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Go.

397
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,395
If you're here,

398
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,197
Jeremiah must
still be alive.

399
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,234
And if you're here, I'm guessing
you found our test subjects,

400
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,791
all boiled and bubbled.

401
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
What's he planning?

402
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:18,392
Shh. It's a surprise,
don't you know?

403
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,191
A real killer.

404
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,400
Shall I hypnotize
our friends here,

405
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,040
and have them slit
each other's necks?

406
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,640
Nix.

407
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,519
Better check
with the boss.

408
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,390
He might have other ideas.

409
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,793
I'm sorry I got you
involved in this.

410
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,119
Don't be.

411
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,416
I knew what I was
getting myself into.

412
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,159
I know, but, Lee...

413
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,915
Jim, whatever
you want to tell me,

414
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,759
save it till
we're out of here.

415
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
Fair enough.

416
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,471
We need to find out
what Valeska's planning.

417
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,480
Hey, Tetch.

418
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,394
You know, it's funny.

419
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,994
I never figured you for
Jeremiah's errand boy.

420
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,438
Oh, Captain.
No errands do I run.

421
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,155
This is simply a way
for me to have some fun.

422
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,596
Tell yourself that.

423
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,919
What are you
when you would take away

424
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,833
your games and your rhymes?

425
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,670
Nothing but a second-rater
with a really silly hat.

426
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,676
Shut up.

427
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,720
Beautiful.

428
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
Beautiful.

429
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,392
Lee Thompkins,
you do intrigue me so.

430
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,316
First, you were a doctor,

431
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,192
then the Narrows queen.

432
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,760
Tell me, please do,

433
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,957
are you running
from your past

434
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,552
when you become
someone new?

435
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,673
When I found Jeremiah,

436
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,760
he had a bunch of crazies
digging this tunnel for him.

437
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,880
Well, that certainly
fills me with confidence.

438
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,631
Whoa. You hear that?

439
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,753
- Alfred.
- Selina.

440
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,715
What are you doing here?

441
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
And with that?

442
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,273
I should ask you
the same thing.

443
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,635
What's down that tunnel?

444
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,031
Well, it was Wayne Manor
till Jeremiah blew it up.

445
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,913
He sealed the only way out
of Gotham.

446
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
No.

447
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,559
J-Jeremiah is not alive.
I-I saw him die right here.

448
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,790
Yeah, well, you're wrong.

449
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,676
We all were.

450
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,509
And now he's embarked
on some madcap scheme

451
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,040
where he's reenacting the night
Bruce's parents were killed.

452
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,080
Where's Bruce?

453
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,560
He's gone
after Jeremiah.

454
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,275
He could use your help.

455
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,199
Wait.

456
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,351
Don't you think
that because

457
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,513
I did not kill Jeremiah does
not mean that I won't kill you.

458
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,840
Selina.

459
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,476
You killed my friend Tabitha.

460
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,960
You deserve to die.

461
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,156
Selina.

462
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,119
Just put the knife down.

463
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,679
Bruce needs you.

464
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,713
I suppose I should thank you.

465
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,598
Or you could help me
to the Green Zone.

466
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,789
Of course. It's that way.

467
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,000
Jeremiah!

468
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,079
Show yourself!

469
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,160
Olé!

470
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,474
Hola, Bruce.

471
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,196
Well, here we are,

472
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,751
the theater where your mommy
and daddy took you to see

473
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,350
<i>The Mark of Zorro.</i>

474
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,595
Ha-ha!

475
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,515
I had heard you were obsessed
with this man as a child.

476
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,149
I wonder what it was
that intrigued you so?

477
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,199
Was it the fact
that he struck fear

478
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,959
into the hearts of his enemy?

479
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,630
En garde!

480
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,839
Hee-yah!

481
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,672
Take that, you villain.

482
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,960
Vagabond.

483
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,996
Scoundrel.

484
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,000
Warned you.

485
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,072
Perhaps the movie was a bit
too effective.

486
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,798
Isn't this the part where you
became frightened?

487
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,714
When you asked your parents
to leave?

488
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,840
I wonder what would
have happened

489
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,394
if you hadn't done that.

490
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,439
If you had conquered your fear.

491
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,232
Maybe your parents would still
be alive.

492
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,310
Well, on to the last

493
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,711
and final stop down memory lane.

494
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,070
Stop!

495
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,436
Stop!

496
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,279
That's far enough, Bruce.

497
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,630
Jeremiah.

498
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,915
You don't have to do this.

499
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
But I...

500
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
I do.

501
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,677
You see, I-I came to this
realization.

502
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,556
I realized that no matter
what I did

503
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,633
to bond us, some random gunman
in an alley

504
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,713
would be the man who you were
tied to the most.

505
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,638
The man you saw
when you closed your eyes.

506
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,634
I want to be the star
of the show.

507
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,429
So if I can't have you as
a brother bonded by love,

508
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,034
then we'll just have
to be bonded by hatred.

509
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,736
And you think
killing two people

510
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,956
that look like my parents
will do that?

511
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
It won't.

512
00:29:56,121 --> 00:29:57,616
Well, then it's a good
thing I already put

513
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,077
a bullet in both of their
fraudulent skulls.

514
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,960
Oh, you're confused.

515
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,112
You're wondering if
I already shot them,

516
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,757
then who's this lovely couple?

517
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,078
Thomas, Martha...

518
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,317
...why don't you turn around?

519
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,031
Jim!

520
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,350
I know.

521
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,832
See, o-over the course
of our little adventure,

522
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,074
fate brought to me James Gordon
and Leslie Thompkins,

523
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,837
and I thought to myself,
why not...

524
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,551
why not kill the man
who you think of

525
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,757
as your second father figure?

526
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,710
And your dear, dear,

527
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,237
dear friend Lee Thompkins.

528
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,520
And when I do,

529
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,960
finally, you and I
will be bound together.

530
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Because you see...

531
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,235
...re-unification with the
mainland hangs on by a thread.

532
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,960
Those fireworks go off

533
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,920
and toxic chemicals rain down
onto the city,

534
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,151
and the government...

535
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,152
...cuts us adrift for good.

536
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
Jeremiah.

537
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Don't.

538
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
Shh.

539
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,116
The pièce de résistance.

540
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,354
One last thing.

541
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,991
I had Jervis Tetch
hypnotize them

542
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,560
so that they'll wake up
the moment

543
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,430
these beautiful pearls hit
the ground.

544
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,155
I want you to see them realize
what I've done to them

545
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,392
as the life drains
from their bodies.

546
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,834
Never forget,

547
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,711
this is all for you, Bruce.

548
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,360
No!

549
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,080
Selina! The pearls!

550
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,476
Ecco! Now!

551
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,936
We need to stop
the fireworks.

552
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,040
- They're gonna...
- I know.

553
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,471
You go after Jeremiah and Ecco.
I'll take the truck!

554
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,720
There's no way to stop them all.

555
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,840
Get to Harvey.

556
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,440
Warn the people in
the Green Zone to get to cover.

557
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,713
What are you... Jim!

558
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,594
Jeremiah!

559
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,276
Face me!

560
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,310
Here, Bruce.

561
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,320
Jeremiah!

562
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,076
This ends.

563
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,879
- Tonight.
- No.

564
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,437
No, Bruce. Now it begins.

565
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,440
Yes.

566
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,398
You feel it.
The connection between us.

567
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,276
You do.

568
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,234
Don't you? Bruce, you feel it.

569
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,315
Tell me you feel it.

570
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,957
You mean nothing to me.

571
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,036
Why don't you understand?

572
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,479
You need me.

573
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,915
I'm the answer
to your life's question!

574
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,360
Without me,
you're just a joke...

575
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,357
...without a punch line.

576
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,953
After all this time,

577
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,593
you've come to me for help.

578
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,632
After allowing Strange
to put a chip into my brain.

579
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,632
Attempting to sell me out
to Gordon.

580
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,435
And after naming...

581
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,398
...a dog after me.

582
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,870
First of all,

583
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,479
I am very fond of that dog.

584
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,516
Secondly, I had Hugo Strange
save your life.

585
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,030
Thirdly, do you really think

586
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
I didn't have plans

587
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:34,272
to save you from Jim Gordon?

588
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,600
You always have an answer for
everything, don't you, Oswald?

589
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,110
We have been
through all of this before.

590
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,794
I've tried to kill you.

591
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,113
You've tried to kill me.

592
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,555
But here we are in this room.

593
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,920
Together.

594
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,710
It means fate has
different plans for us.

595
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,320
What are these plans?

596
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,511
Haven't you realized
what Gotham is yet?

597
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,318
It is no longer a city.

598
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,600
It is a prison.

599
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,357
And I think it's time
we escaped.

600
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,875
You heard the news?

601
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,560
Everybody's
talking about it.

602
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,993
Reunification
isn't happening.

603
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,391
Word of the chemical spill
reached the mainland.

604
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,311
No action until the government
can determine if Gotham is safe.

605
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,712
I figure at least
a couple of months.

606
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,480
You don't sound surprised.

607
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,595
Guess I'm not.

608
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,834
Could've been much worse.

609
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,312
You stopped that.

610
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,296
Every time I think
we're turning things around,

611
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,880
I look up...
right back where we started.

612
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,879
What were you
about to say to me

613
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,238
when, uh, Tetch had us?

614
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,195
I don't know.

615
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,318
I guess I, uh,
would have said...

616
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,956
what I said the last time
we saw each other.

617
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,632
I wish I could go back.

618
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,960
Do things differently.

619
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
Better.

620
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,318
- It feels like a long time ago.
- Nothing's changed.

621
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,993
But it has, Jim.

622
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,279
That was a mistake.

623
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,350
A mistake?

624
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,999
Put yourself in my shoes.
After everything you said,

625
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,437
suddenly you're having a baby
with Barbara, of all people.

626
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,760
But it's not just that.

627
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,456
You talk about doing
things differently

628
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,834
and I keep thinking,

629
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,752
what if we hadn't lost ours?

630
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,319
What are you doing here, Lee?

631
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,996
I don't know.

632
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,949
I know you've taken
on so much, and...

633
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,352
and I want to be
understanding, but...

634
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,759
you let me down, Jim.

635
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,595
I'm sorry.

636
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,870
What does that mean?

637
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,390
For us?

638
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,156
I don't know.

639
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,116
Can't change the past,

640
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,840
so I guess we just
have to live with it.

641
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,720
No, Lee...

642
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,476
I can't believe
he's still alive.

643
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,433
They've been doing scans,
and he has no brain activity.

644
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,313
He's no longer a threat.

645
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,473
To either of us.

646
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,637
Thank you for coming to help me.

647
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,696
That night your parents
were killed,

648
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,757
I should have done something.

649
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,513
Selina, you've done enough.

650
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,913
It's not much, but it's home.

651
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,157
I've been looking through
your treasure trove.

652
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,474
- You've been a very naughty boy.
- Barbara?

653
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,034
How did you...

654
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,680
Selina?

655
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,716
Hmm. She and I
were gonna go murder-halfsies

656
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,559
to get you back for Tabitha,

657
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,435
but it seems I will have to do
the dirty work myself,

658
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,750
as usual.

659
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,036
Oh, my God.

660
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,635
You're pregnant.

661
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,760
- How could you possibly know that?
- Look at you.

662
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,230
She's glowing.

663
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,234
You're glowing.

664
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,440
How very observant of you.
Adieu, Oswald.

665
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,676
Wait!

666
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,629
Come with us.

667
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,832
- What?
- Yes.

668
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,030
I killed Tabitha.

669
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,596
You're angry.

670
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,600
You want revenge.
But do you really want

671
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,959
to raise your child
in a toxic waste war zone?

672
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,833
Come with us.

673
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,870
Are you telling me
you found a way out of Gotham?

674
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
Ed did.

675
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,436
It's a submarine.

676
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,349
- A submarine?
- It can track

677
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,677
mines in the river using sonar.

678
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,155
So, where's this submarine?

679
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,116
We have to build it.

680
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,000
Yeah, I'm gonna shoot you.

681
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,480
God.

682
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,955
What is happening to me?

683
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,274
- Perhaps...
- Shut up!

684
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,238
That was a
rhetorical question.

685
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,995
Fine.

686
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,479
I won't shoot you
for the sake of my child.

687
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,558
- But I will never forgive you.
- Of course.

688
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,074
I understand.

689
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,995
Call me when it's done.

690
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,470
- So, who's the lucky father?
- Shut up!
