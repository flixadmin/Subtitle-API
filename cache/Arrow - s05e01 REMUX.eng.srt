1
00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:03,546
Last season, on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,713 --> 00:00:07,008
I convinced you that we can have it all.
I was wrong.

3
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:08,968
We have to let each other go.

4
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:12,847
I have a village, too. Run by
a government strongman named Kova.

5
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:16,642
You'll go back to Russia,
and you can take on this Kovar.

6
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:19,103
What are you gonna do now, Oliver?

7
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,317
I know you wouldn't approve of what I did.

8
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:26,611
But you were always
better than me, Laurel.

9
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,863
That is what I loved most about you.

10
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,711
I thought about Laurel
and what she'd say.

11
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:32,283
I think she'd tell me to get out.

12
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,868
What are you gonna do?

13
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:37,121
Take some time
away from this team,

14
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,332
away from the city.

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,126
I, Oliver Queen, do solemnly swear
to faithfully

16
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:46,297
and impartially perform and discharge
the duties of the office of mayor.

17
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:58,142
- Your brother's late.
- "Late" is his "on time."

18
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:01,145
And he's not just my brother,
he's the Mayor.

19
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:03,898
Well, maybe someone should
remind him of that.

20
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,859
Is there something
I can help you with, Captain?

21
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,508
This evening is important, Miss Queen.

22
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,093
And it's supposed to be the kickoff
to the Anti-Crime Initiative.

23
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,012
And I don't think I need to tell you
how much this city...

24
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:21,832
City needs the A.C.I. Yes, I know
and so does he so he will be here.

25
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,710
He's just taking care
of a little business first.

26
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:26,295
Blonde or redhead?

27
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:29,006
Brunette actually.

28
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:01,914
I found the bomb.

29
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:08,796
No, no, no. That's not "a bomb,"
that's one, two, three, four bombs.

30
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:24,473
I'm in the brains.
It's gonna take a while to disarm.

31
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:29,066
- Do you think you can keep Machin busy?
- I don't think that'll be a problem.

32
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:39,744
Does this mean you're not gonna kill me?

33
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,246
What's a guy got to do
to get a little love?

34
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:46,042
I only tried blowing up the city.
I mean, half of it.

35
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,420
Sleep.

36
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,256
Tell SCPD I left a present for them.

37
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:54,467
Get away from that!

38
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,260
I'm disarming it.

39
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:01,807
It's handled. Overwatch?

40
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,186
Yeah. Oh, man,

41
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:07,553
that thing's just a really ugly piece
of modern art now.

42
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,485
Aw. You gonna make a new friend?

43
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,947
I thought I told you
to stay off the streets.

44
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,867
- It's my city, too.
- You wanna help?

45
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,035
Yeah.

46
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,329
Then make a donation
to the police department.

47
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,792
- And keep that elevated.
- Keep what elevated?

48
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,172
I don't want to see you out here again.

49
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:46,519
The Mayor will be making his official
statement on the Anti-Crime Initiative

50
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,580
at the ceremony honoring
the Black Canary, but...

51
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,482
But he can say a few words now.

52
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:54,652
The A.C.I. is an important step
towards lowering crime in the city,

53
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:57,196
but I'm not gonna consider it
without some major reform.

54
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:58,489
What type of reforms?

55
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,866
Uh, to start,
an investigation into allegations

56
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,153
of widespread corruption
within the police department.

57
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:06,122
Okay. Mayor Queen will elaborate
on all comments

58
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,968
at the ceremony honoring the Black Canary.

59
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:10,334
Thank you all very much.

60
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,295
You realized you just
accused the police department

61
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,339
of being corrupt
at the police department gala?

62
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,549
I answered a question.

63
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,760
Yeah, and you also just put blame
on the police department

64
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,555
instead of taking responsibility
for the city's crime.

65
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,766
- You know I'm taking responsibility.
- Yeah. As the other guy.

66
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,937
But as the Mayor, it looks like
you're sleepwalking, okay?

67
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:33,190
Showing up late again
is not helping that perception.

68
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:37,153
Being the Mayor gives me access
to actionable intel as "the other guy."

69
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,029
It's a means to an end.

70
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,532
Well, it didn't start off
like that, Ollie.

71
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,035
You wanted to become
and then became the Mayor

72
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,080
- to actually be Mayor.
- Right. And then reality set in.

73
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:51,250
Even if we weren't dealing with
a corrupt police department, and we are,

74
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:53,817
or an electorate that thinks
I got all my political knowledge

75
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,005
by binge-watching The West Wing,

76
00:04:56,172 --> 00:05:00,050
I still wouldn't be able to focus
on being the Mayor, Speedy.

77
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,720
Because I'm flying solo
as "the other guy."

78
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:05,055
Okay, nice try.

79
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,224
Talk to the comptroller
about tax incentives.

80
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,768
- And Councilman Garcia about sanitation.
- Mmm-hmm.

81
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,230
I also put the applications
for Deputy Mayor on your desk.

82
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,232
I'm gonna go drink.

83
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,720
What I do care about is what
you promised me if I won tonight.

84
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,938
None of yours.

85
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:41,902
What?

86
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,370
Whose?

87
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,717
What are you two doing here?

88
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,511
- It's late.
- That's what I told her,

89
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,930
but she's been complaining
that the secondary processor

90
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,765
keeps overclocking the GPU cache.

91
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,372
It must be nice to have someone
down here who speaks Felicity.

92
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:17,688
Well, I'm strictly repair and maintenance.
You guys are the vigilantes.

93
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,524
Yeah, well, it's getting to be
an awfully big club.

94
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:25,029
- What's this?
- A little dossier on Wild Dog.

95
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,906
- "Wild Dog?"
- Yeah, you know, 'cause of his shirt.

96
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,926
"Silly Dog" just didn't really
have the same ring to it.

97
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,910
I suggested the "Wild."

98
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,538
Right. And why do I need a dossier on him?

99
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,625
So, I was thinking,
instead of putting an arrow in him,

100
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,918
you might consider
bringing him into the fold.

101
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,629
He shot him? You shot him?

102
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,357
Okay, I know it's not the most enticing
of recruitment pitch plans.

103
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,109
But there are plenty of candidates
willing to compensate

104
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,173
for our ineffectual-slash-corrupt
police department.

105
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:52,389
Evelyn Sharp. Mr. Ski Goggles.
I'm still work-shopping that codename.

106
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,142
I'm not...
I'm not putting together a new team.

107
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,912
Okay, well, in case you haven't noticed,
we're a little short-handed.

108
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,065
Just for a little while.
John will come back.

109
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,777
- Thea will come back.
- And if they don't?

110
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:09,406
Then I will handle it.
Get some sleep. Both of you.

111
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,709
SCPD! We have you surrounded.
Guns on the floor, now!

112
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,842
What is this? These aren't our guys.

113
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,428
No, they're Los Halcones.

114
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,685
See, they tried to rob you tonight.
A shoot-out ensued.

115
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,772
You killed them. They killed you.

116
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,862
Drop the bodies,
empty the cash into the van.

117
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:56,120
Bravo! Cleverness and efficiency.

118
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,706
Very Robin Hood.

119
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,459
But I doubt that
you'll be providing the poor

120
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:07,423
with any of these ill-gotten gains.
Enlighten me.

121
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:11,844
- I'm new in town.
- Kill this prig.

122
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,639
Note! Any attempt to "kill this prig"

123
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,726
will result in your swift demise.

124
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,737
- Are you the one in charge?
- Go to hell.

125
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,029
Oh...

126
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,907
I'll take that as a "yes."

127
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,372
Okay, gang.

128
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:58,682
He said he was in charge.
Anybody else want to be in charge?

129
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:03,979
No takers? Then I guess
it's gonna have to be me.

130
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:12,821
Six DOA's. The dealer and his girlfriend,
two Los Halcones and one of our own.

131
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:16,784
And who's lucky Number Six?
Keating.

132
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,870
COD doesn't match the other vics,
who were all shot at close range,

133
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,873
- but Keating...
- Blunt force trauma.

134
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,375
And these, what?
Some sort of calling card?

135
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,628
M.O. matches a skel named Tobias Church.

136
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:32,090
According to his jacket, he and his crew
tore up Hub City and Blldhaven.

137
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:36,053
- And now he's here.
- Question is, what was Keating doing here?

138
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,057
Nothing good.
He didn't call anything in.

139
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,184
You think he's one of the bent cops?

140
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,938
It doesn't matter. He's dead now.

141
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,316
Well, Lance was a royal pain in the ass,

142
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,693
but at least he kept
his department in line.

143
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,863
Well, you could always give him
his badge back. He's back in town.

144
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,492
Though word has it he took a few bumps
off the wagon on his way.

145
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,419
All right, all right, all right.
All right.

146
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:19,012
Knockin', that's not like you.

147
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,139
Give us a minute.

148
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:30,274
- How long you been back in town?
- Uh, couple of weeks.

149
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,111
- Where's Donna?
- She's in Heaven.

150
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:40,158
It's a casino in Vegas that
she's waitressing at these days. Not...

151
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,913
- So you two aren't, uh...
- Oh, come on, Oliver.

152
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,209
- Opposites attract, but not that much.
- Did you break up before...

153
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,130
Well, you know,
not that it's any of your business.

154
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:58,051
But you see, a drunk needs a reason
to stay sober.

155
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,596
Fresh out, my friend.

156
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,390
Well, Quentin...

157
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:06,727
You know what? I don't know if you're in
a position to be judging me anyway.

158
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,650
It's just me out there.

159
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,487
Sometimes, saving the city
takes priority over running it.

160
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:21,575
But that'll change
when the team gets back together.

161
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,161
I can devote more time
to actually being the Mayor.

162
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,457
That team could include you.

163
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,710
Would I cover up
this beautiful face with a mask?

164
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,337
That's not what I meant.

165
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,340
Is there anything else
I can help you with, Oliver?

166
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,675
I got a pretty full day ahead.

167
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,474
You know about the ceremony?

168
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,020
The city's gonna honor Laurel.

169
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,859
Yeah.

170
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:02,324
It's probably best I don't turn up
and embarrass her memory, then.

171
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:24,096
You killed my best fighter.
You cost me lots of money.

172
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,519
Your Russian's terrible.

173
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,772
Your accent's American.

174
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,235
So,

175
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,780
what are you doing so far from home?

176
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:49,037
Adam Hunt. Daniel Brickwell.
Frank Bertinelli.

177
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:53,083
If I were you...
I'd put that back in my bag.

178
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,919
Jason Brodeur. Leo Mueller...

179
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,214
I said, put it back.

180
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:01,967
You know what?

181
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,386
This book, it intrigues me.

182
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,348
It's the only reason
you are still breathing.

183
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:14,771
It was my father's.
I'm waiting to use it.

184
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,606
Waiting for what?

185
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,817
To be ready.

186
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,778
Well, I have some bad news for you.

187
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,994
You're going to be dead before you are.

188
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:32,289
You must be lost. City Hall is that way.

189
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:35,000
Wanted to see
if you had info on our new player.

190
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,437
And you wonder why your approval rating
is in the basement.

191
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:40,589
- I don't wonder.
- How'd you ditch your security detail?

192
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:43,133
I used to ditch John Diggle.

193
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,636
Yeah. Tobias Church.

194
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,514
AKA "Charon."

195
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:53,769
The ferryman of Hades. Left gold coins on
the eyes on one of his victims last night.

196
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:54,978
Well, well, well...

197
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,914
I didn't fail every course
that I took in college.

198
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,608
Warrants out for his arrest
on no less than 20 murders

199
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:02,152
and those are just the ones
that they can connect him to.

200
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,154
Mr. Church just became our top priority.

201
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:06,531
"Our" is not going
to be enough for this guy.

202
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:07,699
Okay. Felicity...

203
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,660
Church runs with a crew.
And yours is not coming back.

204
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,705
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

205
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,592
It's called "not being in denial."
You really ought to give it a try.

206
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:20,587
Look, for the past five months,
you have been frozen in amber.

207
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,924
Waiting for things to go back
to the way things were, they're not.

208
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,718
You need to move forward.

209
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,221
Especially, with guys like this
coming into town.

210
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,265
Don't worry about him.
He's not gonna be staying very long.

211
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,727
Just find a way
for me to find him, please.

212
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:45,195
- Why isn't he at City Hall?
- That's a question I keep asking myself.

213
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,242
- What are you workin' on?
- If Oliver's asking,

214
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:50,534
- a location for our new baddie in town.
- And if he's not asking?

215
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,555
Got an address for this guy.
You mind checking him out for me?

216
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,206
I'm a happily married man, Felicity.

217
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,875
Just see what you can find out.
Like, if he's loco or anything.

218
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:02,212
We are callin' him the "Wild Dog."
Isn't that already settled?

219
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:03,630
- Please?
- No.

220
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,340
- Please.
- Okay. Fine.

221
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:13,140
Cities are like gen pop. First day in,
you find the biggest guy in the yard,

222
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,017
put him down. Hard. Sends a message.

223
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:20,021
"Screw not with me."
So here we all are.

224
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,732
Now who's the biggest guy in the yard?

225
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,445
It's highly unlikely that
he will just come out to play.

226
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,073
But it's like my younger brother
always said,

227
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,409
"Don't fish without bait."

228
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,416
Thank you all for coming.

229
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,663
With all that ails our city,
I think it's fair to ask

230
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:45,589
why we would spend time and money
to honor anyone.

231
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:50,719
Why we would commission a statue
and have a ceremony to unveil it.

232
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:54,598
Surely those resources
could be put to better ends.

233
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:58,810
But I for one think
there is no better end than a reminder

234
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:03,273
of what we are capable of
when we stand together united.

235
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:07,235
A reminder of those
who have made the ultimate sacrifice

236
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,446
protecting our home.

237
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:14,993
And a reminder that as long as
we keep their spirit in our hearts,

238
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,623
there will always be better days ahead.

239
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,920
And as she reminds us,

240
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,172
let us always remember her.

241
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,803
Ladies and gentlemen, Laurel Lance.
The Black Canary.

242
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,959
Whoal!

243
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,253
- Felicity.
- We saw it.

244
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,256
Why didn't Oliver fight back?
Sorry. Really dumb question.

245
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:54,303
- Yeah, well, can we track the van?
- No, they shut down traffic cameras.

246
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,886
And there're no satellites over the area.
We're blind.

247
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,093
Okay, well, if that SCPD van was legit,
then the police are gonna be no help.

248
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,701
Well, maybe this is a job for Speedy.

249
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,893
Can you suit up
and hit the streets for intel?

250
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,229
Can you maybe try to hack into
the police department

251
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,857
and see if there is any
internal chatter we can go on?

252
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,444
Gentlemen. And lady.

253
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,613
This is not personal.

254
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:20,869
I know it feels personal. But it is not.

255
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:24,956
You are all here as a means to an end.

256
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,085
I finally figured out a way
to make politicians useful.

257
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:32,088
You want the Green Arrow?

258
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,633
Ooh.

259
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,262
Your Honor.

260
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:44,267
Listen, the Green Arrow is not coming.
You're wasting your time.

261
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:49,689
Just for the fun of it, how is it that you
know so much about Mr. Arrow?

262
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,526
I have it on pretty good authority
that he's tied up right now.

263
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:58,031
- Are you his buddy?
- I have connections.

264
00:19:58,365 --> 00:19:59,616
And I... Listen.

265
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,035
You let these people go,

266
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:06,289
and I'll make something happen.
Do we have a deal?

267
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:09,125
No, we most certainly do not.

268
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,795
I don't need your help, Mr. Mayor.

269
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,965
Do you think I would go to
all this trouble without a plan?

270
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,134
Yeah.

271
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,640
But that's because I think you're stupid.

272
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:29,354
Take Mr. Queen to a quieter place
and teach him some manners.

273
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,154
You almost shot my friend in the head.

274
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:44,828
Leave us.

275
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,334
My book!

276
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:05,515
Oliver Queen. My brother.

277
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:10,854
Anatoly. It is very good to see you.

278
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,731
What are you doin'?

279
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,069
Ahh!

280
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,449
I just dislocated thumbs. Useful if
getting tied to chair is to become habit.

281
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:27,704
- This is going to hurt little.
- Son of a bitch!

282
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:30,248
Yeah, with bit of practice
you can do yourself anytime.

283
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,500
Anatoly, can't you bring
a knife next time?

284
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,669
What is fun of that?

285
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:37,839
My old friend, I thought you dead!

286
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:42,802
Well, if you hadn't have shown up,
I probably would be.

287
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:47,140
It's good to see you, tovarisch.

288
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,766
What are you doing in Russia?

289
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,770
I'm here to kill Konstantin Kovar.

290
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:57,942
If this is true, I did you no favor
by saving your life just now.

291
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,574
We got a twenty
on Oliver's location.

292
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,826
- Felicity and Curtis?
- Neither.

293
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:12,582
Felicity says it's probably the work of
a "Tobias Church."

294
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,769
And look, he's done his homework too
'cause he knows the Green Arrow is workin'

295
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:19,297
with someone who's tapped into
the city's security cameras of...

296
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,549
Okay, so, he's trying to call
the Green Arrow out.

297
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:24,928
Yeah, except he doesn't know
he's already got him. Cute, huh?

298
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,598
All right, well, you...
You need to go do something.

299
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:31,601
Well, that was...
That was gonna be my line to you.

300
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:36,439
For the first time in a...

301
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:41,110
A long time, I'm really starting
to feel like myself again.

302
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:46,115
I'm not a killer,
I'm not a vigilante, I am...

303
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,869
I am a normal version of me.

304
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:55,708
And I think just after everything
that happened with Laurel...

305
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:01,464
I really needed to know
that life like this was even possible.

306
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:05,635
And now that I do,
I don't wanna give it up.

307
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,931
Yeah, yeah, I get
where you're coming from.

308
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,020
I do. I lost my job, I lost my...
I lost my daughter, I lost my girl,

309
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:19,649
and you know I just wanted to hit pause
on the world, you know?

310
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,069
- Yeah.
- But then I, uh...

311
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,488
You know, what?
I listened to Oliver's speech.

312
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:27,883
Well, you know, that's
when I realized that I, I can't do that.

313
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,743
I can't hit pause on it when I gotta
get on with my life, you know?

314
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:40,169
Even if that life
isn't what I want it to be.

315
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,012
I didn't vote for you.

316
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,432
That's okay. I ran unopposed.

317
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,357
"Mayor Handsome," they call you.

318
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,653
Not for long, though.

319
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,367
If you hit me again...

320
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:18,708
- I'm gonna kill you.
- You're delusional.

321
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,793
You're zipcuffed to that chair.

322
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:38,936
- Please, don't...
- I'm sorry. But nobody can know my secret.

323
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:48,863
- I thought you retired.
- Yeah, me too.

324
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,379
Speedy!

325
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:08,257
There are wires. They've been rigging
explosives to set up a kill cordon.

326
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,260
- A what?
- If we try to get down there

327
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:14,847
- we're gonna blow everything up.
- I can't just leave them there.

328
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:23,106
No!

329
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:27,276
We'll come back for them.

330
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:35,368
Felicity's already looking
for the power station blueprints.

331
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,537
Now, if we can get past
that kill cordon, we...

332
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:41,290
Then we can kill all of Church's men
instead of just those guys?

333
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:44,961
- Excuse me?
- I saw you break that guy's neck, Ollie.

334
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:48,256
You murdered him, okay. I thought
you weren't doing that anymore.

335
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:51,884
Maybe if I showed a little less restraint,
Laurel might still be alive.

336
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,303
Okay, you cannot keep hiding behind that.

337
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,014
And you know that's not
what she would have wanted.

338
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:00,643
You know, Thea, you told me
that the dead don't want anything.

339
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:05,652
Now, I could have killed Damien Darhk
before that night at Iron Heights.

340
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:09,318
I had multiple chances to do so.
And I didn't.

341
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:12,238
Because I thought
that taking the high road

342
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,657
was more important than saving lives.

343
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:19,412
And that is a mistake
that I will never ever make again.

344
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:22,665
I wouldn't call not killing people
a mistake, Ollie...

345
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:25,293
I would. Because when I did take
Darhk down for good,

346
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,005
I had to confront the fact
that Malcolm Merlyn was right.

347
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:33,676
Either I'm willing to do
whatever is necessary

348
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,679
or I shouldn't be out there at all.

349
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:41,851
Which is exactly why I can't be.
I won't ever again.

350
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,729
- Thea...
- No, no.

351
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:49,817
Ollie, I am sorry, but I wanna honor
Laurel just as much as you do.

352
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,696
Just not like this. And I don't care
what your reasons are,

353
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:57,366
putting killing back on the table
is a huge step backwards.

354
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,411
And I don't want anything to do with it.

355
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:09,712
- Sorry that you had to hear that.
- Hazard of the job. You okay?

356
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:13,382
I just... Seeing Thea in the suit, it made
me feel like everything was gonna

357
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:14,717
get back to normal.

358
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:17,362
Well, I'm running out of different ways
to tell you that it's not.

359
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:22,391
Hey. Look, being a vigilante
is not just putting on a mask

360
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,604
and thinking up a codename.
These people are amateurs, Felicity.

361
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:30,608
You really think that they're gonna
replace Dig or Thea or Laurel?

362
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:34,904
They couldn't do that if I wanted them to.
And I don't want them to.

363
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:38,282
They're already out there, Oliver.
Because of you.

364
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:41,911
- Inspired by you.
- After what happened with Laurel,

365
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:44,622
how can you ask me to put
more people in the crosshairs?

366
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:47,291
I am not the one who is asking.

367
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,419
Or do you not remember the promise
that you made to Laurel before she died?

368
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:53,297
Laurel was thinking about the future.
You need to think about yours.

369
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:56,592
Right now, I need to think of ways
to stop Tobias Church.

370
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,803
- Oliver...
- So, you let me know

371
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,180
when you find a way around
the kill cordon.

372
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:12,400
Nothing ever simple with you,
Oliver Queen.

373
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:15,611
You survive Lian Yu, twice, you say.

374
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,781
And instead of going home,
you come to mine.

375
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:23,619
Well, I didn't know this was your town.
Or that you're a Bratva boss...

376
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:27,790
- Avtoritet. It's like a captain.
- Right.

377
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:33,212
- What business do you have with Kovar?
- It's a promise that I made.

378
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,631
What, that you'll kill him?
Or that you die trying?

379
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:37,717
'Cause second's much more likely.

380
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:41,554
Okay, Anatoly, you just need to tell me
if you can get me close to him.

381
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:45,433
Kovar has army. Government soldiers.

382
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,184
It's very dangerous.

383
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:51,022
You're sure you want to risk your life
for this promise?

384
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:03,200
- "The shark that does not swim, drowns."
- What does that mean?

385
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:06,245
I know real reason why you not go home.

386
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,206
You're not swimming.

387
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:14,587
This business with Kovar.
It's old promise. It's in past.

388
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:19,675
You need to move forward, my friend.
You need to move ahead. Move on.

389
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:29,685
All right. But the only way will kill you.

390
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:32,897
- Curtis?
- Okay.

391
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:35,316
This is the craziest
super-hero scavenger hunt

392
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:37,860
I have ever been on.
Not that I've ever been on any, but...

393
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:40,696
Wild Dog isn't a "super hero."
He's a vigilante.

394
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,366
You are really gonna have to explain
the distinction to me.

395
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,868
Either way, we'd have better luck
with an ad in the paper.

396
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:47,512
No one reads the classifieds anymore.

397
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:50,098
Why don't you just come on back,
and we'll figure out our next move.

398
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,374
You got it.

399
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:57,463
What do you want?

400
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:03,928
Hey, this is John. Leave a message.

401
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,347
Hey, John. Um...

402
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:10,393
I hope that everything's going well
over there.

403
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,066
Listen, no pressure, but give me
a call back when you get a chance. I...

404
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,486
I have a question and I figure
you'd probably have an answer.

405
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,446
Be well.

406
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,034
Lonely at the top, Mr. Mayor?

407
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:30,621
Actually, being the Mayor
isn't the job that's lonely.

408
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:34,250
- Thea?
- Thea's not coming back.

409
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,839
Neither is John.
There's a Russian proverb,

410
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,341
been thinking about it a lot recently.

411
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:52,852
"The shark that does not swim

412
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,937
"drowns."

413
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,940
You don't move forward, you die.

414
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:02,611
But listen, you will die if you try takin'
on this Tobias Church by yourself.

415
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,280
There's no more team, Quentin.

416
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:06,127
And I can't trust anyone
on the department.

417
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:09,118
Then don't. Just trust these guys.

418
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:16,125
Lieutenant Conahan.
I trained him back in the day.

419
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,961
The guy is so clean,
he doesn't even double park.

420
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,172
And he's vouched for each
of these officers.

421
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:24,216
- To do what?
- To help you

422
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:27,303
whatever way we can. "We"?

423
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:31,223
Look, I don't know
any Russian proverbs, all right?

424
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,143
- But both of us have got to move on.
- Yeah.

425
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,354
Boy, I thought
that was gonna be a bigger fight.

426
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,231
That's what Laurel would've wanted.

427
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:46,322
After tonight,
I realize anything can happen,

428
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,659
which is why I need you to
make me a promise.

429
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:58,584
- Anything.
- Please...

430
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,589
Please don't let me be the last Canary.

431
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:08,552
That way, a part of me will always be
out there with you.

432
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,348
I promise,

433
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:27,154
There's nothin' out there.
Gonna grab a smoke.

434
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:30,658
We're in.

435
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:32,118
Copy that.

436
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:35,371
I'm gonna disarm the bombs. Fisher'll take
the others and get the councilmen.

437
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:39,708
All right, watch your back, all right?
I got you from here.

438
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,919
And where do they think "here" is,

439
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:44,171
- exactly?
- I forgot to mention that.

440
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:45,339
I am jealous.

441
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:48,217
I've been trying to get Oliver
to work with a team for weeks now.

442
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,886
- They're not a team.
- Well, you can look it up.

443
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:54,640
A team is, "a group of persons
associated with a joint action."

444
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,063
Duck.

445
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:05,901
Duck.

446
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:10,698
Goose.

447
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,413
That's more like it.

448
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,759
Hey! Don't worry!

449
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:34,972
After I kill you,
I will let the hostages go. I promise.

450
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:02,833
Taking heavy fire.

451
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,793
- Fisher?
- I need backup.

452
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,813
Conahan, Fisher's catching heat.
Can you assist?

453
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:08,547
Negative.
We got a bigger problem.

454
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,674
Church has wired the conductor.

455
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:13,904
The conductor is in the center of... If it
goes, the whole building's gonna blow.

456
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:15,596
You have to get out of there.

457
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,682
Not without Church.

458
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:23,187
The whole power plant is gonna go up.
There's nothing I can do to stop it.

459
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,191
Get them out of here.

460
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:28,984
- I'll disarm the cordon.
- I got it.

461
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:38,619
Overwatch!

462
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,959
Hostages are safe.
You have maybe five seconds.

463
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:02,226
Hey. Keep her flying.

464
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,261
Good morning.

465
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:40,222
I had intended to state my position
on the Anti-Crime Initiative

466
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,891
during the city's tribute
to the Black Canary

467
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,019
but that speech was cut short.

468
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:48,063
In the intervening days,
I have refined my position.

469
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,066
Now, I have been reluctant
to embrace the A.C.I.

470
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:54,737
because of widespread corruption
within our police department.

471
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:58,407
But these four officers have shown me
and the entire city

472
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:02,619
that there are still good men
and women in the SCPD.

473
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:06,165
Today, I'm announcing the formation
of the Anti-Crime Unit.

474
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:09,001
These four officers will report
directly to me.

475
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,295
And by working together,

476
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:15,466
we will begin the process
of saving our city.

477
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:21,221
Wanna thank you all for comin' out.

478
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:24,391
Wanna thank you all
for deciding to hear my vision.

479
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:28,645
The Green Arrow
cannot be stopped. Unless...

480
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:34,109
Unless we all work together.
Under a singular command.

481
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:38,947
- And I suppose that leader'd be you?
- You need someone from the outside.

482
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:43,952
I know this because it took me less than
12 hours to get inside your organizations.

483
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,121
All of them.

484
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:49,541
What's that mean? "Get inside"?

485
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,593
It means that, Mr. Bertinelli.

486
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:02,179
What are you still doing here?

487
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:04,932
Thought you'd be out celebrating
after your big win.

488
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:06,683
Well, it wasn't exactly a win.

489
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,311
You went from being the Do-Nothing Mayor
to the Rockstar Mayor

490
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:12,773
in under 24 hours.
I would say that that qualifies.

491
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,401
- Church is still out there.
- I'm not worried about that.

492
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,194
What with your new unit of super-cops

493
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:19,255
and the new team of vigilantes
you're gonna be recruiting,

494
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,490
Church is gonna see
the inside of a cell in no time.

495
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,343
- I see what you did there.
- What did I do?

496
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:25,869
You talked about the new team
like it's a done deal.

497
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:29,873
Oh, that. Well, I just thought,
since you decided to

498
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:34,670
"keep swimming" as mayor you might do
the same as Green Arrow.

499
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:36,839
You might be right.

500
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:40,342
Lance told me about the Russian proverb,
by the way. Very poetic. Wait,

501
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:46,432
did you just say I might be right?
Are you okay?

502
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,603
- Been looking into your guy.
- Wild Dog?

503
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:55,441
- Says here, his name is Rene Ramirez.
- Yeah, but "Wild Dog" is much scarier.

504
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,420
- So by "looking into," does that mean...
- I'm thinking of recruiting him.

505
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:00,070
- Good.
- You better.

506
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:05,325
Because if you don't, I have no idea
what I went through this for.

507
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:08,662
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- I was looking for Mr. Dog,

508
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:11,999
and then I was jumped by two insanely
aggressive guys with knives.

509
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:13,518
Do you remember
what they looked like?

510
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:16,378
Yes, and I will tell you everything
on one condition.

511
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,965
You recruit me too.

512
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,885
Okay.

513
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:27,556
Kovar face many threats.
Many people want to kill him.

514
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:32,436
Only people who have power
to get past his army are Bratva.

515
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,981
So,

516
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:39,902
first you say that this is gonna kill me,

517
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:43,906
and now it looks like
you wanna initiate me.

518
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:48,869
Unless you are careful,
it will be one and same.

519
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:54,750
Okay, Anatoly.

520
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:58,170
So, I survive this.

521
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:00,422
Then I'm Bratva.

522
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:03,592
You survive this,

523
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,847
you can begin process of becoming Bratva.

524
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,655
Hey, buddy. How you doin'?

525
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,240
Well,

526
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:30,410
besides feeling like I've got the worst
case of déja vu ever, not bad.

527
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:32,538
- How about you? You still the mayor?
- Yeah.

528
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,456
They haven't voted me out yet, so...

529
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:37,543
Yeah, well, give it a little bit of time
and they'll come to their senses.

530
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,837
I got your message. You all right?

531
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:43,674
I'm all right. I just, I...

532
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,593
I wanted to bounce something off of you.
And get your perspective.

533
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,972
Okay? On?

534
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:53,517
Felicity thinks that it's time
we put together a new team.

535
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:56,436
And you want to know if I think
that's a good idea?

536
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:57,813
I do.

537
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:01,817
I think it is.

538
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:06,822
Wasn't exactly the response
you were looking for, right?

539
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,907
No, no.

540
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,829
But I'm not surprised. Uh...

541
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,024
I need to make peace with the fact

542
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:19,244
that things aren't gonna go back
to the way they were.

543
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:23,672
- So, does that include you and Felicity?
- I don't know.

544
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,655
- Mmm. You're a magician.
- Tough day?

545
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:51,033
Mmm, just long.

546
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,161
Better now.

547
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:12,679
Hey, honey. Yeah, I'm headed home.

548
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:15,307
Yeah, it was a good day. It was real good.

549
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:19,019
Diapers and formula. You got it.
I'll be home in a bit.

550
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,987
How you doing? Help you with somethin'?

551
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:53,428
Green Arrow?

552
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:57,265
No. I'm not Green Arrow.

553
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:28,964
English - SDH
