You, too.

- I only wounded her.
- You brought her down. That's what matters.

31
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:28,285
A fine shot.
Wasn't it, Reek?

A fine shot, master.
My lady.

What about your left?

67
00:05:16,844 --> 00:05:20,180
I can hold a sword, but all
my instincts are wrong.

68
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:22,315
How can I protect the king

69

wipe my own ass?

70

Command.

Father used a sword?

I'm the Kingslayer.

When people find out
I can't slay a pigeon...

75
00:05:37,448 --> 00:05:40,700
Train, then.
Learn to fight with your other hand.

76
00:05:40,702 --> 00:05:44,087
With whom? You?
Men talk.

77
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:46,673
Soon as someone discovers I can't
fight, he'll tell everyone.

78
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,212
You need a proper,
discreet swordsman.

79
00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:55,882
As it happens,
I have just the one.

80

My brother tells me you
can keep your mouth shut.

81
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:09,729

I fuck his wife.

00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:22,472
This was Balon Greyjoy's

You're not a Bolton.
You're a Snow.

Tywin Lannister has given
me the North.

But he won't lift a finger

Theon was a valuable

137
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:50,583
I wanted to trade him
for Moat Cailin.

138

I already asked.

139

Lord Greyjoy refused.
Savages have no...

140
00:09:55,956 --> 00:09:58,958
You sent terms to Balon
Greyjoy without my consent?

141
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,044
You made me acting
Lord of the Dreadfort.

142
00:10:01,095 --> 00:10:02,545
I acted.

143
00:10:08,552 --> 00:10:11,187
I had to smuggle myself

145

147
00:10:17,027 --> 00:10:20,480

But Reek,

Reek will never betray us.

150
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,155
I placed far too much
trust in you.

151
00:10:37,965 --> 00:10:41,835
Reek, how could you let me stand
before my father unshaven?

152
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:45,338
- <i>It's disrespectful.</i>
- I'm sorry, my lord.

153
00:10:47,558 --> 00:10:49,676
Give him the razor.

154
00:10:57,518 --> 00:11:00,770
If I'm not a Bolton,
Father, what does it matter?

155
00:11:08,913 --> 00:11:10,446
Go on, Reek.

156
00:11:10,497 --> 00:11:12,916
<i>A nice close shave.</i>

157
00:11:33,187 --> 00:11:36,639
Reek, tell Father

158
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,726
where are Bran and Rickon Stark?

159
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:41,778
I don't know, my lord.

160
00:11:41,812 --> 00:11:43,563
You murdered them

161
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:47,367
and displayed their corpses
at Winterfell.

162
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:50,820
Ramsay:<i> Reek,</i>

163
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:53,072
did you murder the Stark boys?

164
00:11:53,123 --> 00:11:55,291
No, my lord.

165
00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:56,576
Just two farm boys.

166
00:11:56,627 --> 00:11:59,579
<font color="#804040">RAMSAY</font>: <i>And crisped them

168
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:06,753
The Starks have always
ruled the North.

169
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:09,472
If Bran and Rickon are alive,

170
00:12:09,506 --> 00:12:12,091
the country will rally
to their side

171
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:14,310
now that Robb Stark is gone.

172
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,349
<i>Oh, that's right, Reek.</i>

173
00:12:20,784 --> 00:12:22,819
Robb Stark is dead.

174
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:25,605
<i>Sorry.</i>

175
00:12:25,607 --> 00:12:27,907
<i>I know he was like
a brother to you.</i>

176
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:30,860
But my father put a knife
through his heart.

177
00:12:34,164 --> 00:12:36,282
How do you feel about that?

178
00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:52,181
- You ready for a hunt?
- Always.

179
00:12:52,216 --> 00:12:55,468
Find those boys and I'll give
you 1,000 acres and a holdfast.

180
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,520
Your pet rat have any thoughts

181
00:12:57,554 --> 00:12:59,772
on which way they went
after Winterfell?

182
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:03,943
Jon Snow is at Castle Black.

183
00:13:05,362 --> 00:13:07,313
Who the fuck is Jon Snow?

184
00:13:07,315 --> 00:13:08,698
Their bastard brother.

185
00:13:08,732 --> 00:13:10,984
He could be sheltering them.

186
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:12,618
He may know where they are.

187
00:13:14,238 --> 00:13:17,707
Even if he doesn't,
he's half Stark himself.

188
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:19,375
Could be a threat.

189
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,561
You want to prove
yourself a Bolton?

190
00:13:21,595 --> 00:13:25,164
Gather whatever men you can
and ride for Moat Cailin.

191
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,417
Bring this creature of yours.

192
00:13:28,635 --> 00:13:30,753
Maybe he'll be of some use.

193
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,174
Take the Moat for the family,

194
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:36,893
for<i> our</i> family,

195
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:39,429
and I'll reconsider
your position.

196
00:13:42,516 --> 00:13:45,985
Lord Varys.
Breakfasting with the king?

197
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,322
I'm afraid foreigners aren't
welcome at such exclusive affairs.

198
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:52,158
- Oh, to be foreign.
- Ahem.

199
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:54,327
Shae has been noticed.

200
00:13:54,361 --> 00:13:55,862
Sansa's maid saw you with her.

201
00:13:55,864 --> 00:13:57,580
She already told your sister.

202
00:13:57,664 --> 00:13:59,866
It's only a matter of time
before your father hears.

203
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:03,036
So I'm guilty of being seen
with my own wife's handmaiden.

204
00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:04,871
My father will ask you
if there's anything more

205
00:14:04,873 --> 00:14:06,539
and you'll tell him
some clever lie.

206
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,291
No, I will not.

207
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:11,594
How long do you imagine your father
and sister would let me live

208
00:14:11,628 --> 00:14:13,963
if they suspected me of lying?

209
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:16,382
I have no pet sellsword
to protect me.

210
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:18,468
No legendary brother
to avenge me.

211
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:20,937
<i>Only little birds
who whisper in my ear.</i>

212
00:14:20,971 --> 00:14:22,755
Forgive me
if I don't weep for you.

213
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,808
No one weeps
for spiders or whores.

214
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:28,978
I have friends across
the sea who could help her.

215
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:30,530
She won't leave.

216
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:31,814
I've told her this is
a dangerous place

217
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:33,733
so many times,
she no longer believes it.

218
00:14:33,784 --> 00:14:36,736
Your father has promised to hang
the next whore he finds you with.

219
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:40,323
Have you ever known your
father to make an idle threat?

220
00:14:43,377 --> 00:14:45,545
From House Tyrell and the
people of the Reach,

221
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:49,749
Your Grace, it is my honor to
present you with this wedding cup.

222
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,335
May you and my daughter Margaery

223
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:54,170
drink deep and live long.

224
00:14:54,221 --> 00:14:56,589
A handsome goblet, my lord.

225
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,258
Or shall I call you Father?

226
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:01,844
I shall be honored, Your Grace.

227
00:15:09,186 --> 00:15:11,587
She's the whore
I told you about.

228
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:13,439
The dark-haired one.

229
00:15:15,109 --> 00:15:18,111
Have her brought to the Tower
of the Hand before the wedding.

230
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:29,956
A book?

231
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,425
"The Lives of Four Kings."
Grand Maester Kaeth's history

232
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,760
of the reigns of
Daeron the Young Dragon,

233

Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the
Unworthy, and Daeron the Good.

234
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:40,967
A book every king should read.

235
00:15:50,144 --> 00:15:52,145
Now that the war is won,

236
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:55,364
we should all find
time for wisdom.

237

Thank you, Uncle.

238

One of only two Valyrian
steel swords in the capital,

Your Grace, freshly
forged in your honor.

Careful, Your Grace.
Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.

Our friendship?

257
00:17:50,764 --> 00:17:53,099
There's a ship waiting in
the harbor bound for Pentos.

What?

You'll have your own

a house, servants.

You are. You are afraid of
your father and your sister.

They were the gods
of your fathers, too.

309
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:10,129
I ordered him to tear
down his idols.

310
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,630
He disobeyed.

311
00:21:11,632 --> 00:21:13,966
How many ships did he
bring to your 'cause?

312
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:15,267
How many men?

313
00:21:15,302 --> 00:21:17,636
A good deal more than you.

314
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:20,940
Did you see, Ser Davos?

315
00:21:20,974 --> 00:21:22,274
They're with our lord now.

316
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:24,810
Their sins all burned away.
Did you see?

317
00:21:24,861 --> 00:21:27,530
I'm sure they're more
than grateful, my queen.

One morning, he shot two
seagulls on the beach.

328

I've never tasted anything

You think she's sweet because
she smiles when you visit.

339

She's sullen and stubborn
and sinful.

340

Why else would the Lord of Light
have seen fit to mark her face?

341

She needs the rod.

Women scream

00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:21,933
horrid.

463
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:24,186
What sort of monster
would do such a thing?

464
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,689
As if men need more
reasons to fear marriage.

465
00:32:27,723 --> 00:32:29,224
My lady.
My lady.

466
00:32:29,275 --> 00:32:32,527
Lord Tyrion, you see?
Not as bad as all that.

467
00:32:32,562 --> 00:32:34,229
Perhaps if your pauper husband

468
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,815
were to sell his mule
and his last pair of shoes,

469
00:32:36,817 --> 00:32:40,152
he might be able to afford to bring
you to Highgarden for a visit.

470
00:32:40,154 --> 00:32:43,205
Now that peace has come and
all is right with the world,

471
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:45,323
it would do you good
to see some of it.

472
00:32:45,325 --> 00:32:48,326
You must excuse me.
It's time I ate

473
00:32:48,328 --> 00:32:50,462
some of this food I paid for.

If you somehow managed

Not such a fascinating

Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to
Catelyn Stark. And now my brother.

Must be exciting to flit
from one camp to the next

- Qyburn? Deplorable man.

Brought shame on the Citadel
with his repugnant experiments.

552
00:37:41,287 --> 00:37:43,621

You annoy me right now.

I expect it is a relief,

giving up your regal
responsibilities.

589

Wearing the crown for so many years
