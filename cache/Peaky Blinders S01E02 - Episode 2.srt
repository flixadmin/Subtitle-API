1
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,110
I want you to see this as me
introducing myself to you.

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,790
He said Mr Churchill sent him
to Birmingham.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,310
Something about a robbery.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,110
Thomas, you are a bookmaker,
not a fool...

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,310
You sell those guns to anyone who
has use for them,

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,110
you will hang.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,510
I am just a poor communist frog
with a big mouth.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,310
I'm with you cos you're the only man
round here not scared of them.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,630
The only difference between you
and me, Freddie, is that

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,550
sometimes my horses stand
a chance of winning.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,190
Tommy!

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,400
You fixing races now?

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,480
I'm here about the job as barmaid.

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,240
Are you in position?

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,520
I am, sir.

16
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,880
I thought you said we were going to
the fair.

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,390
We have business first. Come on.

18
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,750
Bring your wits.

19
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,640
What business?
That's the Lee family.

20
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,990
Tommy!

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,590
Johnny Dogs.

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,190
Tommy, how the hell are you?

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,830
All the better for getting the city
smoke out of me lungs.

24
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,150
I thought you became a bit
too grand for us.

25
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,430
I've been busy.

26
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,950
I'm riding with the Lee family now.

27
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,470
I heard.

28
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,590
Myself, I'd rather live among pigs.

29
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,110
Come on, Tommy. No disputing.

30
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,390
So, your first fair since France...?

31
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,600
What do you know about France, you
war-shy Gypsy bastard?

32
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,750
So this is the horse.

33
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,200
And that's the car.

34
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,230
Hang on a minute.

35
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,270
You are not swapping the family car
for a bloody horse.

36
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,390
Of course we're not swapping it.

37
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,550
Huh?

38
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,510
That would be mad.

39
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,920
We're going to play two-up.

40
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:05,680

41
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,550
Here you are.

42
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,420
I knew it. I knew it.

43
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,130
Tommy, you bloody idiot.

44
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,090
Shut up, Arthur, I won.

45
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,250
I promised Johnny I'd let him have a
spin in the car if he lost.

46
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,490
All right.

47
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,770
Are you Lee boys
laughing at my brother?

48
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,250
Are you?

49
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,170
Eh? Tommy...

50
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,930
Tommy.
I asked you a question!

51
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,090
Tommy, come on, it's just the
craic...

52
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,850
Get your family out of here and go
and enjoy yourselves at the fair

53
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,530
before they start a war. Huh?

54
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,450
Yeah, but his mother was
a Didicoy whore.

55
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,890
We will take them before last night's
beer turns to piss

56
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,050
and wakes the devils up.

57
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,690
We will leave no stone unturned.

58
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,530
Every gun, every bullet will
be brought to me for inspection.

59
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,530
Now...

60
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,730
take your positions.

61
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,650
Don't hit me! Get off me!

62
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,010
Freddie!

63
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,450
You're sure your
brothers are at the fair?

64
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,570
If it was them they wouldn't knock.

65
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,690
Mr Thorne...

66
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,970
What is it?

67
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,930
The police are rounding up
the communists.

68
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,010
Come on, Ada, if the cops find me
we are screwed.

69
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,330
Fuck...

70
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,010
Freddie Thorne, open up!
Ada...

71
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,170
You have to jump, Ada.
I'll catch you.

72
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,450
Come on.

73
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,690
Look at this.

74
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,610
A prescription for iron tablets...

75
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,570
for Ada fucking Shelby.

76
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,050
Mrs Donovan, I need that favour.

77
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,050
Come in and be quick.
I'm not coming in. She is.

78
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,690
Holy Jesus, it's the Shelby girl.

79
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,490
You have not seen her with me,
Mrs Donovan.

80
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,210
Give her a cup of tea and let her
stay until the police have gone.

81
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,170
She's the sister of those
Peaky Blinder devils...

82
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,890
And yet she is an angel.

83
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,570
Come on, Ada.

84
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,170
What are you going to do, Freddie?

85
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,290
Me? I'm going to have to leave town
for a bit.

86
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,730
A gentleman would take off his hat...

87
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,170
and put out his pipe.

88
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,970
I see you Specials
only dare to come here

89
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,770
when you know the boys
are away at the fair.

90
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,250
You mean your nephews...

91
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,210
with their guns and their razors?

92
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,130
Is it them
you're lighting candles for?

93
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,490
No.

94
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,010
I am lighting candles for the boys
from the Garrison who

95
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,650
lost their lives in France.

96
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,170
There's a list there.

97
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,530
Look...

98
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,650
I hear you didn't make it to
France, Inspector Campbell.

99
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,250
You've heard of me.

100
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,370
I've heard of you.

101
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,610
Is it the Holy Grail you're
looking for...?

102
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,770
As a matter of fact...

103
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,770
it is the Holy Grail
I'm looking for.

104
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,730
Something precious.
Something stolen.

105
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,650
Perhaps you know what I'm
talking about.

106
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,610
Sorry, I misunderstood
your intention

107
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,890
when you pushed me to the wall.

108
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,330
Turn the place upside down.

109
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,010
Arthur Shelby said
you people would help us.

110
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,650
If we don't know what you've lost,
how can we help you find it?

111
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,730
But I've found out subsequently that
I was speaking to the wrong man.

112
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,290
Next time I want to
talk to the boss.

113
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,810
The Lickey Tea Rooms.
Friday. Ten o'clock.

114
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,250
And when I say the boss,
I mean Thomas.

115
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,850
Come on.

116
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,090
The scum of the Earth...

117
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,770
Now what the
bloody hell's been going on here?

118
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,450
Jesus Christ.

119
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,650
The coppers told everyone
Arthur had agreed to it

120
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,970
when he was arrested.

121
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,490
They said the Peaky Blinders had

122
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,290
cleared out to the fair
to let them do it.

123
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,330
I never said nothing to that copper
about smashing up bloody houses...

124
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,730
All right... which pubs did they do?

125
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,930
The Guns, the Chain, the Marquis.

126
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,690
All the ones that pay you
to protect them.

127
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,730
The only one they didn't touch
was the Garrison.

128
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,570
Make sure people think
we were in on it.

129
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,010
He's smart, this copper.

130
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,130
So, go on.

131
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,130
Drink your beers, get out.

132
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,650
You'd better show people you're
still the cocks of the walk.

133
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,170
Hand out some cash to the
landlords of the pubs.

134
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,370
Pay some veterans to fix
the places up.

135
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,250
Oi, Nipper. Give us the bag.

136
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,090
So, what about you, Tommy?

137
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,090
I have to go to Charlie's to
stable the horse.

138
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,570
She looked foot-sore in the box.

139
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,130
Let them see your faces.

140
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,010
So we both know what
they were looking for.

141
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,010
You don't read the papers.

142
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,010
Racing papers.

143
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,290
So let me tell you the odds.

144
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,290
I reckon it's three to one
there'll be a revolution.

145
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,970
I wouldn't bet on that.

146
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,330
That copper's betting on it.

147
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,690
He's not going to let it rest till
he gets those guns back.

148
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,330
Did he talk to you, Pol?

149
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,170
In the church.

150
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,330
Did he try to find our Ada?

151
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,970
She was sleeping.

152
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,170
Where was she sleeping, Pol?

153
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,490
I thought you didn't care for
women's business.

154
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,690
He knows you're the boss.

155
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,810
He wants to meet you.

156
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,970
Will you talk to him?

157
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,010
No...

158
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,650
you don't parley
when you're on the back foot.

159
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,970
We'll strike a blow back first.

160
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,730
Finn, lad? What are you doing?

161
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,850
We're having a fire.

162
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,010
Two bob for your picture
of the King.

163
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,170
What?

164
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,170
Bring it to Watery Lane.

165
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,450
All right, Finn, lad.
All right, Scud.

166
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,970
We are blocking the entrance, mate.

167
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,010
Come on, keep making your way
through. Come on.

168
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,130
Come on, gentlemen.

169
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,010
Now come on...

170
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,370
Chuck them on, boys.

171
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,610
Well, I hope to God
you know what you're doing.

172
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,770
I'm a reporter with
the Birmingham Evening Despatch.

173
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:22,850
I had a phone call.

174
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,650
Someone called Thomas Shelby.

175
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,570
Come with me.

176
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,530
Come on, folks,
give us a bit of room.

177
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,330
Tommy.

178
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,090
Move back for us, please, folks.
You're Mr Shelby?

179
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,650
All the way back, please.
I am.

180
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,930
You said I would be protected.

181
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,010
You're protected.

182
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,370
What's going on?

183
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,570
There are some things
I want you to write down.

184
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,130
Now, first of all...

185
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,370
it's not that people round here are
disloyal to the King.

186
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,490
It's the opposite.

187
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,890
You see, we don't want our beloved
King looking down

188
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,490
and seeing the things
that are being done to us.

189
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,290
So we are taking down his pictures.

190
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,690
But why are you burning them?

191
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,010
We went through hell for our King.

192
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,090
Walked through the flames of war.
Write all this down...

193
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,610
And now we're being
attacked in our own homes.

194
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,170
These new coppers over from Belfast,
breaking into our homes

195
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,770
and interfering with our women.

196
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,370
We don't think our King would
want to see that happening.

197
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,730
So, we're lighting fires to
raise the alarm.

198
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,130
May I ask you, in what capacity
do you speak?

199
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,010
No capacity.

200
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,810
I am an ordinary man.

201
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,850
I won gallantry medals at the Somme.

202
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,730
I want you to write in your paper
what's going on here.

203
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,610
Go on, go.

204
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,770
Come in.

205
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,370
Here, eh...

206
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,090
there's a telephone call for you,
sir, on the London line.

207
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,730
There is? It's almost midnight.

208
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,090
It's Mr Winston Churchill, sir.

209
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,170
Yes, sir?

210
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,850
Inspector Campbell?

211
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,450
I hear there has been
a bonfire in your city.

212
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:33,010
There was a small fire reported
around nine o'clock on Watery Lane.

213
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,690
But it was certainly nothing to
trouble you about, sir.

214
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,570
Ah,
but I'm afraid it has troubled me.

215
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,010
Half an hour ago I received a
wire communication

216
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,170
from the editor
of the Birmingham Evening Despatch.

217
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,050
It seems one of his reporters was
invited to the fire

218
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,210
and discovered that they were
burning pictures of the King.

219
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,210
Of the King?

220
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,490
Any newspaper report which may cause
embarrassment to His Majesty

221
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,370
is always referred first

222
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,010
and as a matter of routine to the
Home Office.

223
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,650
I will go down there immediately
and arrest those involved.

224
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:11,130
No, you most certainly will
not make arrests.

225
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,490
If there are arrests
there will be trials,

226
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,210
if there are trials there will be
more newspaper reports,

227
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:21,290
which will necessarily mention the
burning of the King's likeness.

228
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:26,730
I put you in Birmingham for one
very specific reason.

229
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,410
Are you any nearer to finding
those stolen guns?

230
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,010
We are making steady progress...

231
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,810
We need results.
Good night, Mr Campbell. Sir...

232
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,930
Could I at least ask,
does this report

233
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,370
name any of those involved?

234
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,850
It names a Mr Thomas Shelby.

235
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,810
The report mentions
he is a war hero.

236
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,370
Good of you to join us.

237
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,570
Where have you been all day?
In bed.

238
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,450
I couldn't sleep.

239
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,570
Then I couldn't wake up.

240
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,770
Then I was cold
and then I had to go for a wee.

241
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,010
Then I was with this bear on a boat,

242
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,810
but that was a dream.

243
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,810
Then I was hungry.

244
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,730
Why are you reading the paper?

245
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,570
Why wouldn't I be?

246
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,290
I've never seen you read the paper.

247
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,650
I've only ever seen you light
fires with them.

248
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,930
The BSA are on strike.

249
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,010
The miners are on strike.

250
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,810
IRA are killing our boys ten a day.

251
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,690
What?

252
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,290
Stand up.

253
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,570
Why?

254
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,690
Just stand up.

255
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,250
Side on.

256
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,490
Hoi! What are you doing?

257
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,610
Ada...

258
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,530
how late are you?

259
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:02,890
One week.

260
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,490
Five weeks.

261
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,410
Seven if you count weekends.
I think it's a lack of iron.

262
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,850
I got some tablets.

263
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,850
But they didn't work?

264
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,690
No.

265
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,090
You can get dressed now, love.

266
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,970
So, am I or not?

267
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,770
Keep bloody walking, Ada. If anybody
sees us here they'll know.

268
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,410
I'm not getting rid of it, Aunt Pol.

269
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,130
Just come home
and we'll talk about it.

270
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,010
You get off me or I'll scream out,
I swear.

271
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,490
All right, if you want to do
this on the street, let's do it.

272
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,090
Whose is it?

273
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,850
If I tell you, you'll tell them
and they'll cut him to pieces.

274
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,410
Not if he marries you they won't.

275
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,450
Will he marry you?

276
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,970
I don't know.
I don't know where he is.

277
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,690
Jesus Christ, Ada. He's gone away,
but he said he'd come back.

278
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,610
Yeah, but they all say
they'll come back.

279
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,210
He's not like that. He's a good man.
He promised.

280
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,130
He will come back,
Aunt Pol, I know he will.

281
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,730
Get me down a Spanish saddle, Curly.

282
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,130
Yes, Tom, a Spanish saddle.

283
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,330
He's a beauty, Tom.
Yeah, yeah, a beauty, Tom.

284
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,410
A fine beast you got there, Thomas.

285
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,090
But is he worth falling out with
the Lee family over?

286
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,730
Just passing it on...

287
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,130
a declaration of war -
the whole Lee clan.

288
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,690
The guns and now this.

289
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,770
The guns are not spoken of.

290
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,610
Right?

291
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,410
Tommy...

292
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,290
you mind how you speak to me.

293
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,370
Forgive me, Uncle.

294
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,010
It's Thomas Shelby against the
whole bloody world, right?

295
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,850
Easy...

296
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,250
Easy, easy.

297
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,570
Whoa.

298
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,130
Easy, boy.

299
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,450
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

300
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,010
Shh.

301
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,770
In France we used to say...
Shh...

302
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:32,290
In France we used to say it's
just the music hall band turning up.

303
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:35,250
Shh. It's just trombones and tubas,
that's all.

304
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,450
It's just noise. Shh. Shh. Shh.

305
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,890
It's just noise.
Hey. It's just noise.

306
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,210
You get used to it.

307
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,850
It's just noise. Good boy.

308
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,010
Good boy.

309
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,890
You have some pain there, boy, hey?

310
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,530
I'm so sorry, Mr Shelby.

311
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,130
I'm Grace, by the way.

312
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,130
I know who you are.

313
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,370
What's his name?

314
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,690
He doesn't have a name.

315
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,090
Poor boy deserves a name.

316
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,330
You have something to say to me?

317
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,130
The other night you came
into the pub and I was singing...

318
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,490
You said singing wasn't allowed.

319
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,730
I'd like there to be one night a week
when there's singing.

320
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,970
I think it would be good for
everyone...

321
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:46,970
Saturday nights.

322
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,090
Harry was too afraid to ask you,
so...

323
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,650
But you're not.

324
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,130
I am.

325
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,890
But I love to sing.

326
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,570
You sound like one of those
rich girls who comes over

327
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,010
from Dublin for the races.

328
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,490
Do you like horses?

329
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,730
How do you fancy earning
some extra money?

330
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,610
Doing what?

331
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,410
Dig out a nice dress.

332
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,610
I want to take you to the races.

333
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,490
Monaghan Boy two to one.

334
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,890
Get your bets in now before
he goes evens.

335
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,650
We've got a couple of changes coming
in, John. Rock Ferry down to eight.

336
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,250
That's for you. Thanks, mate.

337
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,930
Get your bets in now.

338
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,930
20-1.

339
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,450
There you go, take that to
the twins, yeah? Yeah.

340
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,570
Down to tens. That's right.

341
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,130
Doubles?

342
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,210
OK, friend, Monaghan Boy.
You want to push out, mate,

343
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,170
cos it's going to go evens soon.

344
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,930
Good one. Change of ã35...

345
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,930
I've told you...
Sorry, Mr Shelby.

346
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,330
Go on!

347
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,570
All right, Mr Shelby, how's it going?

348
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,770
Hello, Frank, how's the leg?
Not bad. Not bad.

349
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,850
Good. Nice to see you, son.

350
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,290
Morning, Charlie.

351
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,210
All right, Scudboat,
how are we looking?

352
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,050
Looking good, Tommy.
Grand stuff.

353
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,770
Tommy,
they are all here for Monaghan Boy.

354
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,770
That's what
I like to hear, Johnny Boy.

355
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,130
And Aunt Pol wants to see you.

356
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,850
Tell me the man's name, Ada.

357
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,050
Rudolph Valentino.

358
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:12,730
Get out! All of you!

359
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,450
Go on! Now!

360
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,890
I said, tell me his fucking name.

361
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,170
Freddie fucking Thorne!

362
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,130
Yeah.

363
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,730
Your best mate since school!

364
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,530
The man who saved your life
in France!

365
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,290
So go on!

366
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,450
Go on, cut him!

367
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,370
Cut him up and chuck him in the cut.

368
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,250
Oi! I'm a Shelby too, you know.

369
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,170
Put my fucking film back on!

370
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,010
So Monaghan Boy finally lost.

371
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,410
Third time unlucky.

372
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,050
We took money
from all over the city.

373
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,290
Yeah, but you'll pay it back
to people round here.

374
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,490
Buy your popularity back.

375
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,490
Already done.

376
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,330
I taught you well.

377
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,850
And you fixed this race without
the permission of Billy Kimber.

378
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,610
Obviously, I didn't teach
you well enough.

379
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,010
Rule one,
you don't punch above your weight.

380
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,810
Billy Kimber is
there for the taking...

381
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:55,570
Says who? Says Tommy
and his parliament of one.

382
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,650
I ran this business for five
years...

383
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,570
Yeah, while I was away fighting,
remember,

384
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,490
where I learnt some things,
such as

385
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,130
you strike when your enemy is weak.

386
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,610
I thought you came here
to talk family business.

387
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,330
I'll deal with it.

388
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,890
You're too busy taking over the
world... Polly...

389
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,170
If it's about Ada, I need to know.

390
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,970
Ada wants you to give
Freddie this letter.

391
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:31,130
She wants Freddie to know she's
having his baby.

392
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,330
He deserves an opportunity to
do the right thing.

393
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,770
I say we give them a chance.

394
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,650
For a woman who's had a
hard life with men,

395
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,210
you're still full of romance, eh?

396
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,450
What do you think Freddie
sees in our Ada?

397
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,090
That's Freddie's business...
No.

398
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,050
No. I'll tell you what he sees.

399
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:58,130
He sees machine guns, and rifles,
and ammunition,

400
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,970
and some glorious revolution.

401
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,810
What is it you really
don't like about Freddie?

402
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,770
She'll have no life with
a man on the run.

403
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,890
If you can't see that,
you can't see much.

404
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,730
Damn them for what
they did to you in France.

405
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,330
Tell Ada Freddie went to America.

406
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,570
Or Russia.

407
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,090
Polly, it would do no good for Ada

408
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,210
to bring a baby into the world
alone.

409
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,370
Pol, listen.

410
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,730
The truth is you would have hit me
with that thing

411
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,850
if it weren't for the fact
that you know I'm right.

412
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,170
I thought I heard someone knocking.

413
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,490
Couldn't get back to sleep.

414
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,770
The longer you leave it...

415
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,130
the worse it gets.

416
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,250
Believe me...

417
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,330
I know.

418
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,010
I was 16.

419
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,690
And I didn't dare tell anyone.

420
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,330
Polly, Freddie will come back...

421
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,130
In the end I did it myself.

422
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,890
I did it to myself...

423
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,210
and I almost died.

424
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,210
And he didn't come back.

425
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,930
They don't. Why should they?

426
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,010
You know the words.

427
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,170
You're a whore,

428
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,210
the baby's a bastard...

429
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,650
but there's no word for the man
who doesn't come back.

430
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,530
One day...

431
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,850
on your wedding day...

432
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,850
you'll have a good man
on your arm...

433
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:50,450
and you'll say, "Polly...

434
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,890
"thank you for common sense."

435
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,730
This woman is in Cardiff.

436
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,850
We'll take the train tomorrow.

437
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,570
Go to the castle
afterwards for a treat.

438
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:12,490
I chose this place because it is
outside both our jurisdictions.

439
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,530
Do you want tea?

440
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,890
Inspector, I responded
to your invitation

441
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:23,130
because I want us
to understand each other.

442
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,610
I am a businessman.

443
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:28,010
I want to make my business
successful.

444
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:32,690
And I want my city
to run peacefully.

445
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,770
Well, if the city is peaceful,
business can thrive.

446
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,490
So we are on the same side?

447
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,970
I think perhaps we could be.

448
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:58,850
How can we be on the same side
when I see things like this?

449
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:07,930
My men found this in the bedroom
of a known communist.

450
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,650
It has your sister's name on it.

451
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:15,890
It was obvious she had been
sleeping in his bed.

452
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:21,130
Are you also in bed with
the communists, Mr Shelby?

453
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:24,170
I do not share their fantasy.

454
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:29,250
And, as for my sister, I have
already dealt with the situation.

455
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:32,610
Freddie Thorne is at the very
top of my list. So cross him off.

456
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,050
He won't be returning to the city.

457
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,770
I'll make him part of our deal.

458
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,890
What "deal"?

459
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:51,250
You and your Specials will leave
my businesses alone from now on.

460
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:54,810
No more raids into our territory,
no more smashing up pubs

461
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,570
and no more lifting my runners.

462
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,890
You will turn a blind eye to
all my gambling operations.

463
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,570
Also, I am planning an expansion.

464
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,570
Onto the racetracks.

465
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,810
I intend to do business
with Billy Kimber.

466
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,490
He runs most of the legal track-side
betting outside of London.

467
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,890
He has policemen on his payroll.

468
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:18,210
I want you to put in a word with
the Chief Inspector at

469
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:23,610
Gloucestershire that his men should
leave me alone when I make my move.

470
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:26,970
Forgive me.

471
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,570
I don't seem to have a pen

472
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,290
to write down this rather
long list of demands.

473
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,330
And what do I get in return?

474
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,930
I have what you're looking for.

475
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,410
I have the guns.

476
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,850
What guns?

477
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,170
I'm not here to play games...
Wait, wait.

478
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,330
25 Lewis machine guns,

479
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:10,970
50 carbines,
10,000 rounds of ammunition -

480
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,410
all in a crate bound for Libya,

481
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:16,530
stolen from the BSA
factory proofing bay.

482
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:21,050
I'm guessing they sent you to
Birmingham to get those guns back.

483
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:24,050
Well, it's me that has them.

484
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:30,130
I have left word with men I trust
that if I am taken into police

485
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,210
custody for whatever reason, those
guns will be shipped to Liverpool.

486
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,890
From there they will be sent
directly to Belfast

487
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:41,050
and sold to the
Irish Republican Army.

488
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,890
All your good work in Ireland
would be undone.

489
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:46,450
Each stolen weapon is
numbered and marked.

490
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,730
If I sell them to the IRA,
it won't be long

491
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,850
before Mr Churchill finds out.

492
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,850
I imagine you got into enough
trouble over

493
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:55,370
the burning of
the King's photographs.

494
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,650
That was just a taster.

495
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:03,170
If those guns reach Belfast,
your life in the force is over.

496
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,610
When I have achieved what
I have set out to achieve,

497
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,330
I will let you know
where to find the guns.

498
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,930
You'll be a hero.
You'll probably get a medal.

499
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,450
I'm a fair man.

500
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,450
It's a fair offer.

501
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,810
Do we have a deal?

502
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,450
I need an answer.

503
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,490
Right now.

504
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,170
Very well.

505
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,530
But I'd prefer
if we don't shake hands on it.

506
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:04,330
Now why would I shake
the hand of a man who didn't even

507
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,930
fight for his country?

508
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:50,850
Grace.

509
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,770
I have new information.

510
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:06,130
'Thomas Shelby is now
the beginning, the middle'

511
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,730
and the end of your mission.

512
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,770
So what shall I do?

513
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:28,050
It hurts me as much as it
would a father sending his own

514
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:30,610
daughter into a whorehouse but...

515
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:38,010
no matter how repugnant it may be,
you must do everything

516
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:43,650
you can to get close to him and...

517
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,850
find out where the guns are hidden.

518
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:52,010
Of course, when I say everything,
I don't mean...

519
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:56,810
You underestimate me in every way.

520
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,090
Here.

521
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:21,130
'You are now active
in a military operation'

522
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,130
on behalf of the Crown.

523
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:28,330
I wish to God
circumstance hadn't chosen you.

524
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,850
It's what I'm trained for.

525
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,850
I'm late for my shift.

526
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,810
Grace...

527
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:44,050
my heart is with you.

528
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,690
Tom. Tom!

529
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:50,010
Tom, you better come quick. Tom!

530
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,530
Curly, tell me.

531
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,930
It's a curse, Tom.

532
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,850
Curly, Curly, shh, shh.

533
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,770
Curly, Curly.

534
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,050
Tell me.

535
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:30,930
Tell me, Curly, what's
wrong with your horse?

536
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,010
You bought her at the fair
in bad feeling.

537
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,970
The Lees put a bad seed in the hoof,

538
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,370
got an old woman to put a spell...

539
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,130
So those Lee bastards cursed her.

540
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:49,010
Whatever it is, he says
it's spread to the other feet.

541
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:52,010
It's going to his heart
by tomorrow, I'd say.

542
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:56,210
Seen curses like this twice.
Can't take them back, Tom. No.

543
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,330
I told you, Tommy.

544
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:02,490
Better enemies to have than
black-blood Gypsies.

545
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,290
Get out.

546
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:10,690
Get out, Curly.

547
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:17,730
I'm sorry.

548
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,730
We're closed, Mr Shelby.

549
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,730
Just get me a drink.

550
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,090
Should I leave you alone?

551
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:20,330
I came here for company.

552
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:22,130
Where's Harry?

553
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,610
He took the night off.

554
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,330
He went to the pictures.

555
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,770
How's your beautiful horse?

556
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:48,730
I just put a bullet in his head.

557
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,210
Was he lame?

558
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:59,810
He looked at me the wrong way.

559
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:04,610
It's not a good idea to look at
Tommy Shelby the wrong way.

560
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,850
What a waste. Yeah.

561
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:14,130
A waste is what it is.

562
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,850
You know, in France...

563
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:29,490
In France,
I got used to seeing men die.

564
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:33,770
I never got used to
seeing horses die.

565
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:37,250
They die badly.

566
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:46,850
I dug out a dress like you asked.

567
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:48,330
Thanks.

568
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:53,050
Is it Cheltenham
you're talking about?

569
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,810
Cheltenham's a grand affair,
is it not?

570
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:04,290
The King will be there.

571
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:05,690
King George?

572
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:06,650
No.

573
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,730
King Billy Kimber...

574
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,370
and all his men.

575
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,810
And what must I do?

576
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:18,370
For two pounds, you'll do
what I ask you to do.

577
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,530
I want three.

578
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:26,290
If I'm meeting a King,
I won't be wearing a cheap dress.

579
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:31,970
And I asked you to let me sing.

580
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:33,570
That's part of the deal now too.

581
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:36,250
Since when?

582
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:40,250
Since you nearly smiled.

583
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:47,450
Saturday nights, open and easy.

584
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:49,890
Everyone gets to sing their song
just like we did in Dublin.

585
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,250
You never worked in Dublin...

586
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,770
so don't lie to me.

587
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,570
I asked around about that pub
you said you used to work in.

588
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:01,090
I have friends over there.

589
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:03,290
No-one has heard of you.

590
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,810
My guess is...

591
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:15,850
you're a girl from a good family
who got herself pregnant.

592
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,330
It's not something I want known.

593
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:25,970
And bringing a child into the world
alone ruined your life.

594
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,170
Right?

595
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:33,090
So I'm right...

596
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:35,770
and Polly is wrong.

597
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,090
Right about what?

598
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:39,730
It doesn't matter.

599
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:43,570
It looks like it matters to you.

600
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,010
Family business.

601
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:51,090
You won't tell anyone my secret.

602
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:55,010
Do you think I tell people things?

603
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:00,290
So what do you sing?

604
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,250
Anything you want. Right.

605
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:06,970
Get up on a chair.

606
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:17,930
Happy or sad?

607
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:22,690
Sad.

608
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:25,410
OK.

609
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:29,650
But I warn you,
I'll break your heart.

610
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,530
Already broken.

You came back?

It was Tommy who tipped me off.

Maybe he's got half a heart
after all.

632
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:36,370
Tommy got a message to me.

633
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:41,010
It said "Get out of town

00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,050
Go and play snap with Finn.

650
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:03,450
Did you want whiskey as well?

651
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:05,530
No, just beer.

652
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:08,650
Why no whiskey, Tommy?
Are you expecting trouble?

653
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,850
Jesus Christ, Tommy, what the
hell made you let them sing?

654
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:17,290
They sound like they're
strangling cats out there.

655
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:20,370
All right, 20 to play. Come on.

656
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:24,410
What did make you
change your mind though, Tommy? Mmm?

657
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:27,610
Yeah, I mean,
it's about time, Tommy.

658
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:29,650
Time for what?

659
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:32,210
Time you took yourself a woman.

660
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:34,370
Just play the bloody hands.

661
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:38,330
You stay the way you are, Tommy.
Remember what Dad used to say -

662
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:40,290
"Fast women and slow horses...

663
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,290
"..will ruin your life."

It's Billy Kimber.

671
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:23,930
Is there any man here named Shelby?

672
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:35,170
I said,
is there any man here named Shelby?

673
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:43,090
Harry, get these men a drink.

674
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:45,290
Everyone else, go home.

675
00:53:58,130 --> 00:53:59,810
You, go home.

676
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:02,570
But Mr Fenton said...
I said go home.

677
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:08,850
I've never approved of women in pubs
but when they look like that...

678
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:13,810
You said you wanted men called
Shelby. You've got three of them.

679
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:16,810
Right, I'd never heard of you,
then I did hear of you,

680
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:20,250
some little Didicoy razor gang.
I thought to myself, so what?

681
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:23,610
But then you fuck me over

682
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,330
so now you have my
undivided attention.

683
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:31,970
By the way, which one am I
talking to? Who's the boss?

684
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:33,410
Well, I'm the oldest.

685
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:36,130
Ha... clearly.

686
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:37,730
Are you laughing at my brother?

687
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,930
Right, he's the oldest,
you're the thickest.

688
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:45,570
I'm told the boss is called Tommy
and I'm guessing that's you

689
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:48,730
cos you're looking me up and down
like I'm a fucking tart.

690
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:52,090
I want to know what you want.

691
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,730
There were suspicious betting
patterns at Kempton Park.

692
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:58,410
A horse called Monaghan Boy.

693
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:01,650
He won by a length twice
and then finished last

694
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:03,810
with ã3,000 bet on him.

695
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:05,650
Which one am I talking to?

696
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:07,970
Which one of you is the boss?

697
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:09,730
I am Mr Kimber's advisor
and accountant.

698
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:11,610
And I'm the fucking boss, OK?

699
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:16,210
Right, end of parley, you fixed
a race without my permission.

700
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:21,090
You fucking Gypsy scum what
live off the war pensions of these

701
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:23,170
poor old Garrison Lane widows!

702
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:24,570
That's your level!

703
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:28,130
I am Billy Kimber, I run the races

704
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:29,290
and you fixed one of them

705
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:31,810
so I'm going to have you shot
against a post.

706
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:35,090
Mr Kimber.

707
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:40,250
Look at it.

708
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:44,730
That is my name on it.

709
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:46,090
It's from the Lee family.

710
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:50,650
You are also at war with the Lees,
Mr Kimber, am I right?

711
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:57,410
The Lees are attacking your bookies
and taking your money.

712
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:59,410
Your men can't control them.

713
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:00,850
You need help.

714
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:05,930
Perhaps we should listen to what
Mr Shelby has to say.

715
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:08,690
Before we make our decisions.

716
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:12,770
Right, the Lees are doing
a lot of talking at the fairs.

717
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:14,210
They have a lot of kin.

718
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,330
They're saying the racetracks are
easy meat

719
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:18,370
because the police are
busy with strikes.

720
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:22,330
Now, we have connections.
We know how they operate.

721
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:25,370
You have muscle.

722
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:28,490
Together we can beat them.
Divided, maybe not.

723
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:34,770
Mr Kimber, perhaps we should take
some time for reflection.

724
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:38,370
Possibly make arrangements
for a second meeting.

725
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:41,010
I admire you, Mr Kimber.

726
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:46,010
You started with nothing
and built a legitimate business.

727
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:50,130
It would be an honour to work
with you, Mr Kimber.

728
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:54,210
Nobody works with me.

729
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,610
People work for me.

730
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,290
Pick it up, pikey.

731
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:15,850
Sit. Sit down.

732
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,450
That's for your ceiling.

733
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:27,330
Thank you, Mr Kimber.

734
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:33,570
We will be at Cheltenham.

735
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:35,130
As will I.

736
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:58,810
So you picked a fight with
the Lees on purpose.

737
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:03,050
Tommy, we can't mess with
Billy fucking Kimber.

738
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:05,370
Get yourself a decent haircut, man.

739
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:07,210
We're going to the races.

740
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:43,120
