[woman] Cletus. Are you there?

What did the doctor say?

10
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,189
He said the mutations are advancing.

11
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:49,524
My powers are too strong.

12
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,652
Cletus, I'm scared.

13

[Cletus] It's gonna be okay.

They're coming to take me away.

They're sending me to a place

[Eddie] Detective Mulligan,
with all due respect,

00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:31,287
I don't want anything
to do with Cletus Kasady.

47
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:34,083
[Mulligan] Well, that's too bad,
because he only wants to see you.

48
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,711
In my opinion, you had
your chance with Kasady and you blew it.

49
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,465
Right. Um, so, what does he want?

50
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:45,760
Maybe he wants to spill the beans
about where the missing bodies are buried.

51
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49,431
So you're gonna have to do
the right thing for a change.

52
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,516
Hmm.

Take your tiny hands off of me!

00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:03,361
We should be out there,

[whispering] Be quiet.

64

How many times have I told you

65
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:30,221
that I want you to hide yourself
when I am working?

66
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,809
I am serious. It is important.
You have to show me respect.

67
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,769
-Respect? Respect?
-Yes! Yes.

68
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,062
-Okay.
-Okay.

69
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,565
-Kasady gonna give you the scoop, right?
-Right.

70
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:40,732
-Wrong.
-What do you mean?

71
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:42,651
Because you blow everything.

72
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,946
Ah, okay, I see.
You're talking about Anne again.

73
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,156
I miss her!

74

-[in normal voice] I will do it.
-I don't like you.

[Venom] Let me eat him!

76
00:06:54,788 --> 00:06:59,042
You do not deserve nice things.

00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,977
I've been thinking about you.

What do you want, Cletus?
I mean, why am I here?

But why me?

00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,620
[chuckles]

100
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,206
I like you.

101
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,084
All right, it's a deal. [clears throat]

102
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:23,585
What's your message?

Who's gonna read that?

What did you get?

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,748
Uh, I got a headache
and probably got tuberculosis.

What? A little louder.

129
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,209
He read me poetry, man.

130
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:48,753
[Mulligan] Is this some kind
of joke to you?

131
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:50,129
Because I'm not laughing.

132
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,174
[Venom] Yeah, you could do with a laugh.

133

Come on, man. These things,
they just take a little time. All right?

-Do you understand?

00:10:03,143 --> 00:10:07,564
[Eddie] Trust me. The only scoop I'm
getting today is double chocolate chip.

00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,359
[Venom] No! I get brain freeze.

your friendship with Cletus Kasady

is what allowed you
to solve this decades-old mystery?

You are the only person
from the outside world he's spoken with.

Well, you know, he's a serial killer.
I don't see how he can like anyone.

00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:44,476
That's fine.

484
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,936
-[Venom] You suck.
-You suck!

485
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,063
-Excuse me?
-[Eddie] Yeah, wow.

486
00:26:48,147 --> 00:26:52,192
I don't have an explanation for that.
I think I'm having a panic attack, um...

487
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,487
Yeah, I'll sign here.

488
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,825
Stand two feet away from the bars.
No touching the condemned.

489
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,076
Understood.

490
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,371
[guard] Visitor's here!

491
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:04,913

[tense music playing]

493
00:27:12,171 --> 00:27:14,298
This is a "me" thing, not a "we" thing.

494
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,133
[Venom] Everything is a "you" thing.

495
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,720
[Cletus] Oh, happy day for you,
Eddie Brock.

496
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,723
Mm, what a scoop.

497
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:27,228
The end of the Magical Misery Tour.

498
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,189
I worry for your soul.

499
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,651
How will you live with the weight
of snuffing out a man's life?

500
00:27:34,443 --> 00:27:37,863
I was, uh... I was hoping maybe
you could give me a couple pointers.

501
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:43,076
Funny little guy, aren't you?

502
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,036
[beeps]

503
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,081
[Venom] Don't need that.
My memory is outstanding.

504
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,416
Rude.

505
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:51,877
Consequences.

506
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,840
Every decision you ever make.

507
00:27:57,216 --> 00:28:01,716
Who do we leave behind,
and how do we leave them?

508
00:28:04,056 --> 00:28:07,851
A connubial bed, empty.

509
00:28:07,935 --> 00:28:10,854
Waiting in the darkness

510
00:28:10,938 --> 00:28:14,024
for the rescuer who never comes.

511
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:15,234
Because of you.

512
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,028
[Venom] This guy makes zero sense.

513
00:28:17,111 --> 00:28:21,073
You and I are the same.

514
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,284
No. No, we're not.

515
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:26,787
Twisted insides, mean daddies.

516
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,623
You feel like home to me, Eddie.
Like family.

517
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:34,753
And really, truly, that is all
I ever wanted in this world.

518
00:28:34,837 --> 00:28:36,255
Family.

519
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:40,259
Killing your grandmother and your mother
sure is a funny way of showing it.

520
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:47,099
Anything you wanna
unburden yourself with before...

521
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:51,978
um, this happens?

522
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:54,440
Yes.

523
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:59,361
I have wishes to bestow upon you.

524
00:28:59,445 --> 00:29:00,904
[Venom] Oh, that is kind.

525
00:29:00,988 --> 00:29:04,157
I want to wish you...

526
00:29:05,117 --> 00:29:06,868
this heartbreak.

527
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,996
[Venom] Uh-oh. Too late.

528
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,750
I wish for you
to see out your days alone,

529
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,626
as you always have been.

530
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,836
[Venom] Watch it, pal!

531
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,671
Where are you going with this?

532
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:22,255
You are a cancer to everyone
who ever loved you, Eddie.

533
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:27,098
Deceived your trusting fiancée.

534
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:31,560
And no wonder Daddy
could never look at you again

535
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,647
after you killed his wife, your mother,

536
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,356
just by being born.

537
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,607
[Venom] You son of a bitch!

538
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,194
No, no! No, no, don't! Don't!

539
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,571
[Venom] Speak to my friend again
like that! I dare you!

540
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,281
[both yelling]

541
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,783
Hey, hey!

542
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,371
No touching the inmate. Hey, back up!

543
00:29:55,042 --> 00:29:56,334
Eddie?

544
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,003
[guard] You're done.

545
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:02,587
I have tasted blood before, my friend,
and that is not it.

546
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:07,304
Eddie Brock has a big secret!

547
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,972
Shut up, Kasady!

548
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,145
[chittering]

549
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:21,485
-[Venom] That may have been a mistake.
-Shut up.

550
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,738
Hey, aren't you Eddie Brock?

551
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:26,573
I don't know anymore.

552
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,204
-[Venom] Eddie!
-[Eddie] I don't wanna hear another word.

553
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,164
- Eddie.
- I don't wanna hear it.

554
00:30:34,248 --> 00:30:35,749
Eddie, I am sorry.

555
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,044
[Eddie] That was his last time
on record ever!

556
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:42,756
There's no more words for his victims.
You know, they're gone.

557
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,219
Any clues of outstanding bodies,
we've lost forever. And completely...

558
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,762
[Venom] I didn't mean to.

559
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,556
-You didn't mean to?
-And I said I'm sorry!

560
00:30:50,639 --> 00:30:53,933
You didn't mean to, but you did it.
You just decided, I don't know, "Blurgh!”

561
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,102
That's it. You did it.

562
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,438
You didn't even think
we might get caught, get killed?

563
00:30:57,521 --> 00:31:00,232
You don't think about things like that.
You think about chickens.

564
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,694
You think about you, you think about
what you want, and you think about you.

565
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:07,531
Let me remind you of something, Eddie.
You were a loser before I came along.

566
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,950
You were nothing. I made you special!

567
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,077
You made me special?
Let me tell you something.

568
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:15,497
Before you came along, I had a life.
I didn't have chickens, but I had dreams.

569
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:18,709
I had dreams and a fiancée
and a really successful TV show!

570
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:22,004
Ah, but you destroyed
all of those things by yourself.

571
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:26,633
Yeah. But you know what? I rebuilt my life
and now I just wanna live it. Good night.

572
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:28,593
And how did you build this new life?

573
00:31:28,677 --> 00:31:29,719
-Hmm?
-Excuse me?

574
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:34,099
Well, who found the clue on the wall
so you could be this big shiny hero?

575
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,935
Hmm? Who found the clue? Who?

576
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:38,770
-Wow.
-Yeah.

577
00:31:38,854 --> 00:31:43,354
No, no, no. This is not
about being a hero for me, man.

578
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:48,735
This is about wanting to live in peace.
Do you understand what I'm talking about?

579
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,244
No, you don't understand
what I'm talking about.

580
00:31:53,327 --> 00:31:56,246
Okay, this is about me
wanting to live without you

581
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:59,541
whining in my ear all the time
about eating bad guys

582
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,460
or nagging me about Anne

583
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,921
or destroying my place
or destroying my life!

584
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:07,757
Do you know how lucky
you are that I chose you?

585
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:08,968
You chose me?

586
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,720
Buddy, I'm the only person
that took you in

587
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:14,014
when your friends kicked you off
the planet Ming Mong

588
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,182
because you are a reject!

589
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,769
You are a pariah! Lethal protection,
my ass. You couldn't protect anything.

590
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,856
You are useless. You couldn't
get a job down here cleaning toilets!

-[whimpers]
-I'm sorry!

592
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,610
I don't know what came over me.
Please, let me fix it.

593

Take a look at me.
Look at the size of you.

973
00:56:27,049 --> 00:56:29,676
that bizarre outburst
at the lobster restaurant,

974
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,764
and only you at the Life Foundation
when that rocket exploded.

975
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:36,558
And now Clyde's found Bonnie

976
00:56:36,642 --> 00:56:40,145
and there's a dead psychiatrist at a
facility I knew nothing about until today.

977
00:56:40,229 --> 00:56:42,231
And people are talking
about seeing monsters.

978
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,816
Monsters?

979
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,943
Uh, what do you mean "monsters"?

980
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:49,739
Monsters, Eddie! Everywhere Cletus goes,
So goes this supposed monster.

981
00:56:49,822 --> 00:56:51,156
[Eddie] Oh, God.

982
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,699
[Mulligan] Talk to me, Eddie.

983
00:56:52,783 --> 00:56:54,493
-[groans]
-Talk to me.

984
00:56:55,953 --> 00:56:56,954
[veils]

985
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,330
[Mulligan] How's he doing it?

986
00:56:59,957 --> 00:57:03,418
What's the secret?
How's he making people see things?

987
00:57:03,502 --> 00:57:05,629
All right. I, uh... [sniffs]

988
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:09,508
I can't answer any more of your questions
without making my phone call.

989
00:57:14,972 --> 00:57:16,473
I'll get you your phone call.

990
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:19,268
But you know what secrets want, Eddie?

991
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:22,813
They want out.
That's why they're so hard to keep.

992
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,071
[door opens]

993
00:57:31,822 --> 00:57:33,406
[Dan] Eddie asked you to do this?

994
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:36,368
He has no one else that can help him?
We'll be late for the party.

995
00:57:36,452 --> 00:57:37,744
He's in trouble, Dan.

996
00:57:37,828 --> 00:57:39,704
Yeah, trouble is his thing.

997
00:57:41,248 --> 00:57:44,334
-Are there gonna be aliens again?
-No, of course not.

998
00:57:47,004 --> 00:57:48,547
I'd like to speak to him alone.

999
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:52,801
Your duty of honesty supersedes your duty
to the client if somebody gets harmed.

1000
00:57:53,427 --> 00:57:55,554
They teach you that at posh school?

1001
00:57:57,181 --> 00:58:01,393
Oh, hey. Anne. Hey, Anne,
thank you so much for coming.

1002
00:58:01,477 --> 00:58:03,187
Boy, that little guy's a charmer, huh?

1003
00:58:05,147 --> 00:58:07,149
How much do I need
to worry about you right now?

1004
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,359
I messed up.

1005
00:58:08,442 --> 00:58:09,776
Okay. How badly?

1006
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,445
It couldn't be worse, and it's all on me.

1007
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:15,699
Whatever you did,
you just need to tell the cops the truth.

1008
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:19,745
No. No. No, I can't tell them
that they are chasing a serial killer

1009
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,748
[whispering]
who's also got an alien inside of him

1010
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,626
and he's capable of killing everybody.

1011
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:31,715
Venom. Talk to me. What's happening?

1012
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:34,718
No, he's not here. He's not here.

1013
00:58:37,054 --> 00:58:40,724
Is this an "I'm lying" "He's not here"
or is this a real "He's not here"?

1014
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:41,892
He's not here.

1015
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,811
[Anne] Jesus Christ, Eddie.

1016
00:58:43,894 --> 00:58:45,854
[dispatcher over radio]
St. Estes fire. All units.

1017
00:58:45,938 --> 00:58:47,022
What the actual --7?

1018
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:47,981
Eddie, think.

1019
00:58:48,065 --> 00:58:51,401
I don't know. All I know is that he
can't go long without eating food, right?

1020
00:58:51,485 --> 00:58:54,112
So he's eating chicken
and he eats chocolate, and that's it.

1021
00:58:54,196 --> 00:58:56,364
And that is only
if he's still observing the rules.

1022
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:01,996
We need to find him.

1023
00:59:02,621 --> 00:59:04,247
You mean I need to find him.

1024
00:59:04,331 --> 00:59:07,751
Yeah, you need to find him, please.
And then I will fix it.

1025
00:59:08,544 --> 00:59:10,170
-I'll try.
-Thank you.

1026
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:14,508
Mrs. Chen.

1027
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,093
-Who's asking?
-It's me.

1028
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,305
What do you want?

1029
00:59:19,388 --> 00:59:20,597
-[sighs]
-Oh, she's a charmer.

1030
00:59:20,681 --> 00:59:22,265
-Okay, listen--
-You broke Eddie's heart.

1031
00:59:22,349 --> 00:59:24,684
I don't have time to explain
why that's off the mark.

1032
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:27,313
-Do you know where Venom is?
-You wanna break his heart too?

1033
00:59:27,396 --> 00:59:29,523
I'm not gonna get
into who did what to who.

1034
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:31,692
Eddie said
he might be here for the chocolate.

1035
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,110
I need to speak with the alien.

1036
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:35,696
-You said there wouldn't be any aliens.
-I meant more aliens.

1037
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,282
-[reporter on TV] Breaking news.
-The mayor has issued a curfew...

1038
00:59:38,365 --> 00:59:39,574
Turn the volume up, please.

1039
00:59:40,409 --> 00:59:44,909
Kasady and Barrison should be treated
as armed and extremely dangerous.

1040
00:59:45,122 --> 00:59:47,707
An all-out manhunt continues tonight.

1041
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,001
-[TV mutes]
-So?

1042
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:50,627
Cletus has a symbiote.

1043
00:59:50,711 --> 00:59:53,714
Oh, my God! Any other information
you're pathologically lying about?

1044
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,549
-Pussy.
-Excuse me?

1045
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,843
-Eddie needs Venom.
-She just called me a pussy.

1046
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,013
He said he didn't need him,
that life was better without him.

1047
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,140
Okay, I don't understand.
What do you care--?

1048
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:06,309
Oh, wait a second.

1049
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:10,230
You get out here right now.

1050
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:15,444
[gasps] Do you see that?
Seriously, do you see that?

1051
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:16,779
Yeah, hon, I've seen it.

1052
01:00:16,862 --> 01:00:21,362
[Venom] Eddie's going to have to fight
this battle all by his little bitch self.

1053
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:23,410
Don't be a big baby. Go help your friend!

1054
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:26,038
He said I couldn't
get a job fixing toilets!

1055
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:30,334
Cletus will come for him.
He won't survive without you.

1056
01:00:30,417 --> 01:00:34,671
Of course he won't.
Because I am the hero of the two of us.

1057
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,176
Yeah, you're the big sexy hero.

1058
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:46,058
You're the coolest, you're the hottest,
and you're the bravest.

1059
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,101
I am.

1060
01:00:47,184 --> 01:00:48,685
I'm still standing right here.

1061
01:00:48,769 --> 01:00:50,395
No one likes you, Dan!

1062
01:00:51,313 --> 01:00:53,231
I love seeing you in action.

1063
01:00:57,027 --> 01:00:57,861
Mm.

1064
01:00:58,362 --> 01:01:00,947
Let's go save that asshole.

1065

[Frances laughs]

1067
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:10,081
[Cletus] I promised
we'd be free from here.

1068
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:14,211
[Frances] And we'd walk
to the cathedral on the hill.

1069
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:15,963
[both laugh]

1070
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:17,881
A wedding.

1071
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,424
[Cletus] Three guests.

1072
01:01:19,508 --> 01:01:21,843
One for each of us.

1073
01:01:21,927 --> 01:01:24,638
[Frances] The cop that took my eye.

1074
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:26,306
[Cletus] Eddie Brock.

1075
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:29,309
And Venom.

1076
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,146
A red wedding.

1077
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:35,274
[door opens]

1078
01:01:36,817 --> 01:01:37,651
You...

1079
01:01:38,235 --> 01:01:39,694
You didn't find him?

1080
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:51,165
[dramatic music playing]

1081
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:54,710
[officer] Oh, my Lord. What happened?

1082
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:56,878
[officers chattering]

1083
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:08,432
-Hey.
-Dan. All right, let's go.

1084
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:10,559
[Venom] I'm not talking to him!

1085
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:11,935
He doesn't want to come out.

1086
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:15,772
What do you mean? We have to leave now
'cause Cletus is gonna wipe the city out.

1087
01:02:15,856 --> 01:02:18,525
[Venom] We're not doing shit
until he apologizes.

1088
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:20,319
So he's looking for an apology.

1089
01:02:20,402 --> 01:02:22,153
I know that amends aren't your thing--

1090
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,864
Like, as in right now, an apology?

1091
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:26,492
[Venom] I need him to beg.

1092
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:29,578
Fine, I will be the bigger of us.

1093
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:32,956
[Venom] I will always be the bigger of us.
But go on.

1094
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,126
-What is he saying?
-He said he's listening very sincerely.

1095
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,711
All right, listen to this.

1096
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:38,712
I am sorry.

1097
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:40,172
[Venom] Not the right tone.

1098
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:42,216
I'm sorry.

1099
01:02:42,299 --> 01:02:43,425
[Venom] Nope!

1100
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:45,260
I am sorry!

1101
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:46,845
So weird.

1102
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:47,846
I'm sorry!

1103
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,431
I don't know why you're shouting at me.

1104
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:53,185
Okay, well, fine.
I was a loser before I met you.

1105
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,895
-[Venom] Yup. That's right.
-And, uh...

1106
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:56,730
And now I am someone.

1107
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:01,235
All right? You made me special.

1108
01:03:01,318 --> 01:03:02,652
[Venom] Damn right!

1109
01:03:02,736 --> 01:03:06,072
-Why don't you put a cherry on it?
-A cherry on that? Right. Um...

1110
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:07,741
I'm

1111
01:03:08,575 --> 01:03:11,661
I am truly very sorry
for everything that I said...

1112
01:03:11,745 --> 01:03:13,997
-[Venom] Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
-...everything that I did not say,

1113
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:15,290
everything that I did,

1114
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:18,168
and probably everything that I did not do.

1115
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,170
-[Venom] Mm...
-Yeah, he's thinking.

1116
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:24,754
-Come on, come on.
-[Venom] Mmm...

1117
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:26,426
-Okay!
-Whoa.

1118
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:27,511
Whoa!

1119
01:03:29,221 --> 01:03:30,972
-Oh, no.
-[Venom] Kiss her!

1120
01:03:31,056 --> 01:03:32,932
Are you gonna kiss me now?

1121
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:34,685
-No!
-[Eddie] No?

1122
01:03:34,768 --> 01:03:36,519
[Anne] God, I'm never doing that again.

1123
01:03:36,603 --> 01:03:39,230
Well, maybe never.
I don't know. Honestly, it's really fun.

1124
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,109
[Venom] If we save the day, can we
call ourselves the Lethal Protector?

1125
01:03:42,192 --> 01:03:43,109
