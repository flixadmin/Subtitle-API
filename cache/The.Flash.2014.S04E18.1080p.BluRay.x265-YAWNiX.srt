1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:06,209
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:09,166
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,252
<i>but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:15,089
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,390
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

6
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:20,219
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

7
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:23,350
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,148
<i>And I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,192
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,941
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,442
Just one more bus meta out there.

12
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,820
Edwin Gauss.
We better find him before DeVoe does.

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,446
This is an intelligence booster.

14
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,779
You're talking about intense
amounts of dark energy

15
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,488
<i>going right into that cap.</i>

16
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,698
I'm gonna help you finish
the thinking cap

17
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,078
without using dark matter.

18
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,158
Fine.

19
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,211
Good evening, Dr. Wells.

20
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,504
How can I be of service?

21
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,751
Hello, Gideon.

22
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:58,299
Good ol' CCTA bus number 405,
where I was gifted with pretty much

23
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,553
the best powers ever.

24
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:00,884
If it wasn't for this old girl,

25
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,265
I'd still have to leave the couch
when I need to use the bathroom.

26
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,972
- You know, because I can...
- Yes, I know.

27
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,940
All right, this might be
our last chance

28
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,517
to find any clues
on the final bus meta

29
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,228
- before DeVoe catches him.
- Yeah, we know what happens next.

30
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,688
What do we know about this meta?

31
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,908
Other than his name, Edwin Gauss?
Nothing, it's like he disappeared.

32
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,787
Well, that explains the brand-new
beepy flashy schmancies.

33
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,616
Cisco designed these scanners
to look for dark matter anomalies,

34
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,167
so anything that looks
weird, all right?

35
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,212
Waves, ripples, whatever, log it.

36
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,415
Oh!

37
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,840
- I got something.
- What?

38
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,501
My Big Belly punch card.

39
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,507
Only five away
from a free kids' meal.

40
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,304
If I even live long enough to use it.

41
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,182
Man, don't even joke like that,
we're gonna get DeVoe.

42
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,180
Throw him in the Pipeline,
long before he gets to you.

43
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,596
Right, if that doesn't work, we'll
just take him out the other way.

44
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:47,805
What other way?

45
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,182
We'll put him down with a shovel.

46
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,313
Give him his harp and wings,
send him to visit

47
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:52,894
Grandma Thinker in the sky.

48
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,106
Ralph, you think
we're gonna kill DeVoe?

49
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,034
The way that you're saying that
makes me think

50
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,156
I'm supposed to say no?

51
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,870
Okay, look.

52
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,536
I've taught you a lot
about being a hero, right?

53
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,586
You ready for what's
probably the most important lesson?

54
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,917
We never have to kill.

55
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,503
For people with our abilities,
there's just always another way.

56
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,834
You understand?

57
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,635
Allen, you complete me.

58
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,715
- Bring it in.
- I'm good.

59
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,300
- Thank you.
- Just a little bit.

60
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,601
Come on. Okay.

61
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,770
What's this?

62
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,434
Wait a second.

63
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,899
I talked to the guy
who was sitting there.

64
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,730
I remember 'cause I paid his fare.

65
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,118
Uh... U-oh.

66
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,655
I think I may have left my wallet
in my other pants.

67
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,366
Look, buddy, either pay the fare,
or you hit the sidewalk.

68
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,826
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,411
Mr. Bus Driver, dude.

70
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,498
Allow me to pay his fare.

71
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,124
Who are we to be the gatekeepers

72
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,094
of whatever path
this fellow traveler is on?

73
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,596
Have a seat.

74
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,347
Uh... Thanks.

75
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,678
<i>Namaste, hermano.</i>

76
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,764
<i>Namaste</i> in the back of the bus.

77
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,811
You're a funny fat dude.

78
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,688
This is crazy, his residual
dark matter reads as if

79
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,740
he was here one second
and the next, vanished.

80
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,620
It's Harry, he wants us back
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

81
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,698
Says he got something important
to show everyone.

82
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,033
Well, now so do we.

83
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,873
Yeah, right, come on.

84
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,164
THE FLASH

85
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,168
That's the big news?

86
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,505
You're taking a sculpture class
at the community college?

87
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,055
It's not art.

88
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,099
It's science! And as such,

89
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,303
it is the thing that
is going to help us defeat...

90
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,347
DeVoe.

91
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,898
Recall, if you will, the one thing
that we've seen, nay, heard,

92
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,691
that can actually harm DeVoe.

93
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,397
Izzy Bowin's sound wave powers.

94
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,232
No, Izzy was killed by DeVoe,
so whatever power she had

95
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,362
is in his hands now.

96
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:08,697
And now, Joe, they're in ours.

97
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,577
Watch this.

98
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,907
So...

99
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,619
Maybe you should

100
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,584
take a couple of steps back
if you value your internal organs.

101
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:28,883
I know how that feels.

102
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,641
One strike

103
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,896
incapacitates The Thinker. Two strikes,

104
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:39,314
no more Thinker.
I call it a Sonic Scepter.

105
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,527
Okay, points for alliteration.

106
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,108
Basically just a big tuning fork.

107
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,192
My goodness.

108
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,781
It's not just any tuning fork.
This might be the most powerful

109
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,240
tuning fork in the multiverse.

110
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,542
You must've laser shaved
this thing down to the nano.

111
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,290
Shaved it right down to the last
angstrom as a matter of fact,

112
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,416
child's play for me
and my thinking cap.

113
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,045
The Sonic Scepter mimics
Izzy Bowin's sonic frequencies,

114
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,501
so we can penetrate
a heretofore impenetrable

115
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,881
force field of DeVoe.

116
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,679
And here's the best part.
Because there's no tech involved...

117
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,007
It's Kilg%re proof.

118
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,261
- Yes.
- Nice.

119
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,890
So, now we just need to figure out
where DeVoe is gonna appear next.

120
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,720
As a matter of fact,
before you got here,

121
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,649
I've scripted a subroutine
on the pocket dimension predictor

122
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,350
and it's gonna give us
a massive head start.

123
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,189
DeVoe's next location, thank you.

124
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,192
Yesterday, I thought you said
that was impossible.

125
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,523
That's right, Snow,
I did say that yesterday,

126
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,858
but today...

127
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,485
Is a new day.
I've got a million new ideas.

128
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,660
The cap and I are...

129
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,870
Firing on all cylinders.

130
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,247
Onward and upward.

131
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,750
Okay, let's get to it.

132
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,958
Cisco, can you integrate
Harry's algorithm

133
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,713
- into the predictor?
- Can do.

134
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:45,793
Okay.

135
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:49,764
Hey.

136
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:55,057
Harry's really loving
that thinking cap, huh?

137
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,264
Oh, my God, it's like
the best friend he never had.

138
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,645
I mean, he wears this thing
everywhere, I'm pretty sure

139
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,317
I saw him step out
of the shower with it.

140
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,980
I wanna know what kind of problem
he was trying to solve in there.

141
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,610
No, no, I don't wanna know.

142
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,911
What are you working on?

143
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,834
My brain. Or brains.

144
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,333
I think I've finally figured out
the science behind what

145
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,504
activates Killer Frost.

146
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,837
So, in fight or flight,
the adrenal glands flood the body

147
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,294
with catecholamines,
AKA the stress hormone,

148
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,755
and guess where the highest
concentration of dark matter is

149
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:31,965
in my body?

150
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,470
In your adrenal glands?

151
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,801
Exactly. So,

152
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,729
if adrenaline is what activates
Killer Frost, then all I need...

153
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,100
Is a shot of epinephrine?

154
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,774
No more Harry and Cisco traumatizing
me to get Killer Frost to show up.

155
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,101
Can't wait to tell her.

156
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,562
Wait, you guys talk now?

157
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,740
Sort of. We leave each other notes.

158
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,912
"Thanks for the badass new jacket,
I got some blood on it.

159
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,739
"Don't worry, it's not ours."

160
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,454
I guess her humor
is sort of an acquired taste.

161
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,123
Uh-oh.

162
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,582
Pocket dimension is about to open.

163
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,508
It's DeVoe, get that pen ready.

164
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,841
Okay, stay ready.

165
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,742
Edwin Gauss?

166
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,335
What?

167
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,927
All right, guys, say hello
to our last known bus meta,

168
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,175
Edwin Gauss. As we know,
there's not much on him.

169
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,177
No college history,
no known addresses,

170
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,680
just a couple of backpacking photos
on an old message board.

171
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,638
Old? Flip phones are old,
this site is from the age

172
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,814
of dial-up. Try prehistoric.

173
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,233
No digital fingerprint,
everything this guy owns

174
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,435
is strapped to his back.

175
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,862
He was off-grid before
he was even a meta.

176
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,986
That and his powers are
the reason that we couldn't find him.

177
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,692
And why there were
12 heat signatures

178
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,368
on the bus, including the driver.

179
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,533
Cisco, the way he appeared
and disappeared.

180
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,659
Pocket dimension.

181
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,706
What, like the DeVoe kind?

182
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,285
No, like the Edwin Gauss kind.

183
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,122
You see, pocket dimensions
like the one you see here

184
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,877
are unique to their users.

185
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,960
Just like DeVoe can only enter
or exit his,

186
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:35,217
Gauss, too, is limited
to his own pocket dimension.

187
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,717
So, why does DeVoe need him?

188
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:40,097
Well, DeVoe uses his chair
to create pocket dimensions.

189
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,099
If he has Edwin Gauss' powers,
he won't need it anymore.

190
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,680
Then we need to catch Gauss first.

191
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,890
And we will.

192
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,692
Little late, just tweaking
the cap. Now, listen,

193
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,066
locating this meta is not a task
that we have to accomplish.

194
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,022
"Why is that, Harry?"
I'll tell you why,

195
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,733
it's because we already have.

196
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,784
Now, this is the map that we constructed

197
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,033
of all the pocket dimension activity
throughout Central City.

198
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,206
Right, but that's when we thought
all the pocket dimensions

199
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,750
belong to DeVoe, now we don't know
whether they belong to him

200
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,247
- or to Gauss.
- And figuring out

201
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,920
those distinctions, sorry,
but that's too big even

202
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,090
- for your britches, Harry.
- My britches are plenty big.

203
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:14,010
Okay? I fill my britches,
watch this, okay.

204
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,508
By simply tracking the
trillions of identifiers,

205
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,136
cross-referencing the fluctuation
migration patterns

206
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,636
and the temporal displacement
and energy...

207
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,808
And...

208
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,730
I give you Edwin Gauss'
pocket dimension activity.

209
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,769
"Ah! Harry, it's amazing."

210
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,777
Yeah, let's all just split up
and search each one

211
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,405
for Edwin Gauss.
Barry you take Caitlin and Ralph,

212
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,452
and I'll go with Cisco
and my dad, Harry.

213
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,949
- I'll go with you.
- No, I was thinking that

214
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,248
you could just stay here
and hold down the fort.

215
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,791
Okay, I'll tweak the cap.

216
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,669
Detective, are you not going
after Gauss?

217
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,720
I'm on my way out,
I just wanted to see

218
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,298
if you needed anything
before we left.

219
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,470
If I need? No, I'm good.

220
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,394
Holding that thinking cap real close.

221
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,267
Never know when you might need it.

222
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,558
You only need it for
DeVoe-related problems, right?

223
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,064
DeVoe-related problems,
science problems.

224
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,486
Making the perfect omelet.

225
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,651
You make omelets with that cap?

226
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,857
Yeah.

227
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:18,941
Pretty darn good omelet.

228
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,742
I bet. Hey.

229
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,780
- Do you mind if I borrow the cap?
- No, I don't think so.

230
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,618
- Not a good idea.
- Why not?

231
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,911
It seems pretty easy to use.

232
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,993
Detective, this "easy-to-use"
thing is actually

233
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,420
a delicate scientific instrument
that directly alters

234
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,338
the brain wave of the user,
so I don't think so.

235
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,585
Hmm.

236
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,417
- So, it's dangerous?
- Yeah, it's very dangerous.

237
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,632
And yet you risked using it
to make breakfast?

238
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,350
All right. Okay, you're good, Detective.

239
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,351
How much do you wear that cap?

240
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,307
I'm not overusing it
if that's what you're asking.

241
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,065
Overusing is one way of putting it,
addiction is another.

242
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,441
I'm not addicted to...

243
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,149
Your concerns are well-founded.

244
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,950
Ramon had the same concern.
I told him...

245
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,824
No, I promised him
I would not use this thinking cap

246
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,155
with dark matter.

247
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,041
- Hmm. And that's a promise you kept?
- Yes.

248
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,291
I don't mean to be paranoid.

249
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,836
Sometimes it's just hard
to turn off the cop brain.

250
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,210
I get it. No worries.

251
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,171
Good luck finding Gauss.

252
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,446
Guys.

253
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,406
Where are we?

254
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,658
Looks like some
sort of hippie commune.

255
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:48,865
Yeah. Smells like one too.

256
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,449
I think I figured out DeVoe's plan.

257
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,579
He means to suffocate us

258
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,080
with B.O. and incense.

259
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,996
Well, this is the last pocket
dimension hot spot on our list.

260
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,833
So just... Do you see Gauss anywhere?

261
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,962
Unwashed flower child.

262
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,513
Have you seen this man?

263
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,257
No.

264
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,602
I've seen the soul that belongs
to this man.

265
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,101
Dude's aura is a trip.

266
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,978
Wait, so you know Edwin Gauss?

267
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,309
Sure do.

268
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,352
Around here, we call him

269
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,400
"The Folded Man."

270
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,945
- Folded man?
- He's everywhere.

271
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,284
And nowhere.

272
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,280
But mostly he's around here.

273
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,827
Time for the reflection hike,
everyone, don't forget to leash

274
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,003
your spirit animals.

275
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,880
Literally already smells better.

276
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,343
Okay, let's just search for Gauss
and stay in touch over the comms.

277
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,886
Yeah, I will leash my inner
penguin spirit animal

278
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,384
and head south.

279
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,511
Be careful.

280
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,263
Don't touch anybody.

281
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,560
Okay, remember
if we find Gauss first,

282
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,767
we might be able
to put an end to DeVoe's plans.

283
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,476
Speaking of ending DeVoe...

284
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,607
- It's not what I said.
- Allen, I'm just saying

285
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,860
DeVoe has been ahead of us
at every turn, his backup plans

286
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,612
have backup plans. On the off chance

287
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:06,943
that we can't capture him,

288
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,527
shouldn't we be willing to do
whatever it takes?

289
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,987
- We know that he is.
- I am willing to do

290
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:13,040
whatever it takes, except kill DeVoe.

291
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,992
- Even in self-defense?
- It's not self-defense

292
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,452
if you're already thinking about it.

293
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,878
Look.

294
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,131
I've been down this road,
I know you're scared,

295
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,674
I understand the temptation,

296
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,128
but you have to hear me when
I say there's always another way.

297
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,846
I really hope you're right, rookie.

298
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,641
<i>Guys, I've got eyes on Gauss!</i>

299
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,893
He's fast for a non-speedster.

300
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

301
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,977
Easy narcs, hey.

302
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,817
- I give up.
- We're not cops.

303
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,616
But you are in danger,
we are here to protect you.

304
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,819
Oh. Righteous.

305
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,279
Is that why you brought
your ninja buddy?

306
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,614
What?

307
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,292
Caitlin.

308
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,671
Meet us at S.T.A.R. Labs.

309
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,380
<i>You can't stop me, Mr. Dibny.</i>

310
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,475
<i>I'll cut through all of Team Flash
to get what I want.</i>

311
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,229
Are you sure you're okay?

312
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,062
Yeah, I mean the wound started
healing before I even woke up.

313
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,862
You frosted out for a sec
when we got here,

314
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,189
- it probably helped.
- Yeah.

315
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,401
Hey, shouldn't you rest?

316
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,194
Honestly, I'm fine.

317
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,280
If anything, this has just made
me more determined

318
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,457
to get DeVoe. I'm gonna
go help Cisco with that

319
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,908
pocket dimension predictor.

320
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,500
Well, it could've gone worse.

321
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,877
Yeah, all things considered,
we got pretty lucky.

322
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,003
Yeah.

323
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,673
Lucky? Are you two serious?

324
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,259
Am I the only one
who's paying attention here?

325
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,306
Ralph, the mission was successful.

326
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,392
Caitlin's okay and Edwin
agreed to stay in the Pipeline.

327
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,845
Edwin will be safe in there.

328
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,103
Safe. Because DeVoe
has never successfully attacked

329
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,434
metas in a maximum security
facility before.

330
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,736
Wait, he did exactly that.

331
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,734
- Watch it, Ralph.
- I have been watching.

332
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,819
Watching DeVoe ahead of us
at every turn,

333
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,492
watching Caitlin get skewered,
watching the metas drop

334
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,912
like flies one by one,
because we can't save them.

335
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,582
And why? Because we won't make
the tough call and end DeVoe

336
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,126
- when we get the chance.
- Look, I'm not doing this.

337
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,046
Okay, Ralph, I get where
you're coming from.

338
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,590
But that is not the tough call,
that is the wrong one.

339
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,589
Mr. and Mrs. S.T.A.R. Labs agree.

340
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,215
I swear, if I was running this team...

341
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,921
- But you're not!
- Okay, all right. That's enough.

342
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,473
We don't have time for this, okay?
We need to focus

343
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,017
and stick to the game plan.

344
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,971
Find DeVoe, hit him with the scepter
and put him in the Pipeline.

345
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,350
No one has to die.

346
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,642
Same plan again.

347
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,811
And you wonder
why he's always ahead of us.

348
00:15:47,835 --> 00:15:49,835
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

349
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:14,838
Yo.

350
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,015
Magnum, P.I.

351
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:21,311
I am digging this
tiny padded room, bro.

352
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,640
It's like an eggshell for my body.

353
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,772
Which is the eggshell for my soul.

354
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,405
Which contains the universe
on this...

355
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,701
Zesty Ranch.

356
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,944
Right on.

357
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,030
You strike me
as a munchies kind of guy.

358
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:45,001
Guilty. Wait, wait,
not actually guilty,

359
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:49,001
it's not like I'm on anything.
You guys said you aren't cops, right?

360
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,749
- Nope.
- All right.

361
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,960
But apparently we have to follow
more rules than they do.

362
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:56,593
Well, whatever rules protect me
from the evil genius dude,

363
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,093
I shall heed.

364
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,050
Even his name is creepy.

365
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,432
The Ponderer.

366
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,721
It's Thinker.

367
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,936
Yeah, sure is a thinker.

368
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,440
Make me think about my journey,
like first time I folded,

369
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,399
I was in this white space for days,
and then another time,

370
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:18,532
I tumbled down this ramp
in this space-agey room

371
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,079
with blue lights and there was
this bald dude and a professor,

372
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,283
exploding chair with tubes coming out
of his noggin,

373
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:28,462
and there was this lady
in a white lab coat,

374
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,632
with such a hot accent. Ah!

375
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,709
Wait, wait, wait,
Edwin, do you remember anything else

376
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,669
from there? Anything at all?
This is important.

377
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,182
I don't know if this detail
is relevant,

378
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,555
but he had one of those
robot samurai dudes.

379
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,765
You were in DeVoe's lair.

380
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,476
But how can that be?
Cisco said that a pocket dimension

381
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,934
can only be accessed by
a specific user.

382
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,980
I mean, I don't know...

383
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,696
Some places are harder
to get to than others,

384
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,025
but if you set your mind
to a high enough plane,

385
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,360
you can go anywhere.

386
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,116
My mind gets really high.

387
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,822
Edwin, can you get us back there?

388
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,953
For sure.

389
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,332
Come on.

390
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,289
I got more.

391
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,424
I got more.

392
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,215
I cannot do it any faster, Captain.

393
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:21,307
If I apply any more hobby glue,
this ship is gonna blow!

394
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,344
Wow!

395
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,145
This glue is really something else.

396
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,601
I should probably wear a respirator.

397
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,691
Where is it?

398
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,019
Where is what? The exit?
It's right behind you.

399
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,696
- Please and thank you.
- Can't find my thinking cap.

400
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,738
Hey, I don't have it,
Captain Caveman.

401
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,621
I never said you did.

402
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,290
So, why would you volunteer
that information unless

403
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,583
you do have it.

404
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,251
- Get out.
- I know what this is about.

405
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,500
You never wanted me to build
this sucker in the first place.

406
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,831
'Cause you never wanted
me to be smarter than you,

407
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,883
well, guess what, that's funny,
'cause I already am.

408
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,926
What the hell are you talking about?

409
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,797
- What the hell are you doing?
- Give me my cap!

410
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,974
- Hey.
- Give it to me.

411
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,642
- It's mine, it's my cap!
- Cut it out.

412
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:06,764
- It's mine!
- Stop!

413
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,140
Harry!

414
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,437
He didn't take it.

415
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,436
I didn't take it.

416
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,528
You definitely have a problem, man.

417
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,071
- Joe, this is fine.
- Be quiet.

418
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,699
Just listen.

419
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:24,369
I've seen these signs before
with my late wife Francine.

420
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,114
Back then, I didn't intervene

421
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,542
so quickly because I said to myself
I needed to be sure.

422
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,086
But I was sure.

423
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,132
I just didn't want to see those signs
in somebody I cared about.

424
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,177
I can't make you stop using this,
that's up to you.

425
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:45,425
All I will ask is that you take
a long hard look at what

426
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,884
it's doing to you.

427
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,556
And how it's making you treat people
you care about.

428
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,031
Ramon.

429
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,752
Uh... Where are we going again?

430
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,214
You are gonna open up
a pocket dimension into DeVoe's lair.

431
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,048
And I'm gonna stop him for good.

432
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,808
No, you're not.

433
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:34,098
Cisco installed motion detectors
in the Pipeline intake.

434
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,103
I thought it was DeVoe
coming for Edwin.

435
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,602
And I kind of wish it was.

436
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,655
Edwin can get me into DeVoe's lair,
I can end this.

437
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,781
All you have to do is let me go.

438
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,234
I can't let you do that.

439
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,613
Um...

440
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,662
Listen, I don't really
do confrontation,

441
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,991
so can I just go back
to my glass cage?

442
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,700
We're both leaving in a second.

443
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,001
Okay.

444
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,124
Just give me the scepter.

445
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,627
You know I can take it away
from you if I have to.

446
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:00,924
Yeah?

447
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,758
Well, you're going
to have to take it out of me.

448
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,595
Whoa! Bro, okay, I'm actually glad
I stayed for that.

449
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,806
That was trippy.

450
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,141
- Don't do this.
- Do what?

451
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:19,980
This?

452
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,625
I'm sorry, Ralph.

453
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,610
Olive branch?

454
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,203
You don't want to have
a drink with your buddy?

455
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,536
Is that what you call someone
who just went all

456
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:16,867
Thor, son of Odin on you?

457
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,918
- You can take it.
- Yeah.

458
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,123
Look.

459
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,088
I know you're worried about DeVoe.

460
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,011
About what he might do to you.

461
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,840
But there are some
lines we can't cross.

462
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,512
Wow.

463
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,432
You really don't know as much
as you think you do, rookie.

464
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,014
I know what killing DeVoe
would do to you.

465
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,225
You would be throwing away
everything you've done

466
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,150
to become a better man,
to become a hero.

467
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,478
You gotta realize that.

468
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,480
You

469
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,485
are a moron.

470
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,742
- Ralph...
- I am not afraid of DeVoe

471
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,286
or what he might do to me.

472
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,989
I am afraid of what
he might do to you.

473
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,955
And Iris and Caitlin and Cisco.

474
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,294
Joe, Harry, Cecile.

475
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,295
DeVoe has taken out
everyone who has gotten in his way.

476
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,876
And Team Flash...

477
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,679
They will always be in his way.

478
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,968
This was never about
protecting yourself.

479
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,434
I know that killing DeVoe
would mean throwing away

480
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,230
everything I've done
to become a hero.

481
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,193
But aside from my mom,

482
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,944
this team is the only family
that I have ever had.

483
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,700
And I would throw myself
into a furnace

484
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,322
to keep them safe.

485
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,289
DeVoe cannot have them.

486
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,200
They are mine.

487
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,840
What about what we want?

488
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,011
You may not care about
losing who you've become,

489
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,383
but we do.

490
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,137
We like hero Ralph.

491
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,395
Please don't take him away from us.

492
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,164
Well, Ralph was misguided,

493
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,286
but he had a half-good idea.

494
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,839
- Which half?
- We use Edwin Gauss' powers

495
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,757
to create a pocket dimension
to DeVoe's lair.

496
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,755
Yeah, that's the half
I was afraid of.

497
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,302
It doesn't get more
dangerous than this.

498
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,972
So, if we go, everybody
needs to sign off.

499
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:39,927
Look, you two have led this team
through every danger there is,

500
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,057
so if you think this will stop
DeVoe from claiming

501
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,763
any more lives, then...

502
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,602
Let's go get that bastard.

503
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,939
I mean, damn, Joe, you put it
all John McClane like that,

504
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,110
of course, I'm in.

505
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,029
- I'm in.
- I don't even need to ask

506
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,199
Killer Frost how she votes,
we're in, too.

507
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,445
So, it's settled.

508
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,871
Tonight, we take on The Thinker.

509
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,583
- Open it.
- You got it, mega-fast dude.

510
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,874
Open it again in 15 minutes.

511
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,629
If we don't come out with DeVoe
in cuffs,

512
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,461
close it, don't open it again.

513
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,815
It didn't work.

514
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,069
Why would it?

515
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,240
Sound has no effect on a hologram.

516
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,197
If DeVoe's not here, then...

517
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,161
Now, my love,

518
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,376
the real battle begins.

519
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,730
What's happening?

520
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,854
Someone's taken over our systems.

521
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,017
He sealed us in.

522
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,068
The second pocket dimension
opened in S.T.A.R. Labs at the exact

523
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,441
same time as ours.

524
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,611
It's DeVoe, he used
that first opening

525
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,737
to conceal his own entrance.

526
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,409
That's why our sensors
didn't register.

527
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,988
This is all a part of his plan,
the Samuroid attack,

528
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,790
us getting Edwin, using him
to attack DeVoe's lair.

529
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,458
- He wanted us divided.
- Where did Edwin go?

530
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,206
He's back locked in his cell,
and we've got DeVoe's

531
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,458
pocket dimension energy
coming from the Cortex.

532
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,414
That must be where his chair is.
I mean, if we can get to it,

533
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:34,499
we can use it to get our team back.

534
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,129
First, we gotta get ourselves
out of here.

535
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,586
Harry, can you unhack his code?

536
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,591
Trying, but it's too complex.
If only I had my quantum

537
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,263
encryption keys, I could do it,
but they're stuck in

538
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,431
Cisco's workshop.

539
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,850
But we're not stuck in here.

540
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,934
- What are you gonna do?
- It's a little worst case scenario

541
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,389
that I had Cisco whip up.

542
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,613
Get back, get back.

543
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,115
Harry.

544
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,867
- Go, get your...
- I'm going to hack the computers.

545
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,323
Yeah. Iris, get to that chair.

546
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,657
- Dad, you can't...
- Go.

547
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,597
I heard all the commotion
and I thought,

548
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,223
"If DeVoe was here.

549
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,937
"Where would he be going?"

550
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:31,355
Hmm.

551
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,688
A simple deduction for a simple man.

552
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,605
Though I assure you,
you are no threat

553
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:41,191
for an intellect of my magnitude.

554
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,532
Please.

555
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,952
Everyone I fight is smarter than me.

556
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,995
No bad guy has beaten me yet.

557
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:51,292
Well, I'm afraid an old friend
requests a re-match.

558
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,086
I really hate sequels.

559
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,823
Ah!

560
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,366
Mrs. West-Allen.

561
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,118
I was hoping we'd meet again.

562
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,372
You might change your mind
about that pretty soon.

563
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,835
Ah...

564
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,885
There's that passion for
our chat in the courthouse.

565
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,463
But I do remember warning you
that it could easily be destroyed.

566
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,009
And I remember you asking me
what I was willing to do

567
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,183
for my husband.

568
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,182
How about I show you?

569
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,200
Gideon.

570
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,747
Yes, Dr. Wells?

571
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,166
Increase the thinking cap's
dark matter feed.

572
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,587
More.

573
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,961
Warning, safe zone parameters
will be exceeded.

574
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,543
- Recommend...
- Maximum capacity, now!

575
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,046
Ah!

576
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,535
Come on.

577
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,702
A little closer. Little closer.

578
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,918
Warning, fists in Pipeline
are larger than they appear.

579
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,482
No.

580
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,125
God!

581
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,220
Even gray matter as un-evolved
as yours understands

582
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,890
the pain of psychic attacks.

583
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,553
You were born for me, Mr. Dibny.

584
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,978
And now...

585
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,139
You will die.

586
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,933
For me.

587
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:05,236
Yeah? You first!

588
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,357
What's that?

589
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,739
Big old fork to shove up your...

590
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,872
One more strike and you're dead.

591
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,875
I have been waiting
for this a long time,

592
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:30,336
you and me alone
so I can make the hard choice

593
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,966
that no one else will.

594
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,526
Perhaps you are willing to do
what it takes.

595
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:59,742
But it seems my love
is stronger than yours.

596
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,922
Get out of my office.

597
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:14,718
Where is he?

598
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,015
- Iris.
- I'm okay.

599
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,387
I'm okay, the others are
still out there

600
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,763
fighting DeVoe and a Samuroid.

601
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,390
Actually, now it's just DeVoe.

602
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,145
- Iris.
- I'm okay,

603
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,192
- we just need to get DeVoe.
- Breach us to him, I'm ready

604
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,191
- to get blood on this jacket.
- The blowback in the lair

605
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,692
knocked down my breaching.

606
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,943
I'll find him.

607
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,118
Did you just...

608
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:46,295
Beat the Thinker? Yeah, I did.

609
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,790
You just got out-thunk, punk.

610
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,709
And I see you went
with the same plan as always.

611
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,044
Yeah.

612
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,176
Do you remember when
I visited you in prison?

613
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,642
You said that I can have
a greater life if I just

614
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,139
rise up?

615
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:05,432
Well, I'm ready for that life.

616
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,892
And for the first time,

617
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,686
I might even deserve it.

618
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:11,820
Yes.

619
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,990
It appears I have been bested.

620
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,866
However, a tip if I may.

621
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,157
Before you cuff a meta,

622
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,043
make sure the light
is the right color.

623
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,045
Ralph!

624
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,841
Ms. Petty never understood
the full magnitude of her powers.

625
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,052
You're currently
the same gravimetric weight

626
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,636
as a cement truck, Mr. Allen.

627
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,356
That should hold you long enough
to bear witness.

628
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:53,363
Ralph, just fight it, all right,
fight it. I'll save you.

629
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,529
You already did, Barry.

630
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,202
No.

631
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,790
No!

632
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,209
Ralph.

633
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,289
Stay back.

634
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,533
Melt.

635
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,340
All the training.

636
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,972
All the lessons you've taught
Mr. Dibny to help him

637
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,768
reach his full potential.

638
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,646
This body will be
the greatest gift of all.

639
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,350
Thank you, Mr. Allen.

640
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,402
You were an excellent teacher.

641
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,468
We were supposed to save them.

642
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,180
We tried.

643
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,386
We failed.

644
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,730
I know this isn't the ending
we were expecting,

645
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,977
so...

646
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,939
If anyone wants to talk.

647
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,901
Should I track him down?

648
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,536
No.

649
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,155
I think I know where he is going.

650
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,710
Cisco.

651
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,592
Hey, uh, weather says rain's coming,
you mind helping me?

652
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:26,220
Can you get Harry?
I think something's wrong with me.

653
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,933
- All your vitals seem okay.
- Blood pressure,

654
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,813
respiratory rate
seems normal as well.

655
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,519
You're gonna have
to run the test again.

656
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,651
There was some feeling,
I don't know what it was, but...

657
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:43,407
You touched DeVoe.

658
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,613
Hand me the dark matter scanner.

659
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:46,990
The dark matter.

660
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,704
I'll get it.

661
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,242
- Focus, Harry.
- Gotta focus.

662
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,131
There's no trace of dark matter
anywhere in your body.

663
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,719
He must've used Melting Point's
powers to entangle your meta-DNA.

664
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,676
- So, Killer Frost...
- Is gone?

665
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:43,547
Thought I might find you
at the other office.

666
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:45,465
Yeah, well...

667
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,463
Without Ralph being around
to dodge rent,

668
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:48,798
it's only a matter of time

669
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,388
before the landlord
closes this place up.

670
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,979
I know there are some things in here
Ralph wouldn't want anybody finding.

671
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,608
You know, you could just
"whoosh" around

672
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,526
and you could pack up a lot faster.

673
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,899
Yeah, I know.

674
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,577
Barry, look, I just wanna...

675
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,370
Iris, I've...

676
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,874
I know that you're...

677
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:19,169
You're here for me
and that I can talk to you.

678
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,121
And I love you for that, but...

679
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,050
Right now, I just need to pack up.

680
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,882
That's all.

681
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,724
Okay, yeah.

682
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,763
I'll leave you to it.

683
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:29,148
I'll keep them safe.

684
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,946
To our overwhelming success.

685
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,080
Yes.

686
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,999
In more ways than one.

687
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,494
- What do you mean?
- Not only is my new host

688
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:27,502
body immune to the ravages
of my ever-expanding mind,

689
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,927
it also holds an ancillary benefit.

690
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,483
Clifford!

691
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,856
I'm nothing without you.

692
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:59,826
And now all of me
is with you once more.

693
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,350
But we must temper our celebration
with conviction.

694
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,555
Our plans have yet
to reach their apex.

695
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,904
- What is that?
- Dark matter,

696
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:36,908
siphoned from the room where
Dr. Wells was charging

697
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,486
his counterfeit cap.

698
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:43,116
As I predicted,
his hubris was his undoing.

699
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:49,877
And so now, the fire that burns down
Team Flash,

700
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,504
will also light the path
to the enlightenment.

701
00:41:57,528 --> 00:42:05,528
