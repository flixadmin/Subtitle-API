1
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,798
<i>Look at the stars.</i>

2
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,967
<i>Whenever you feel alone...</i>

3
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,260
<i>the great kings of the past...</i>

4
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,138
<i>will always be up there to guide you.</i>

5
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,307
<i>And so will I.</i>

6
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:19,807
My friends, the time of my family's growth
is upon us.

7
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:24,644
This home we share is the fulfillment
of my father's vision.

8
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:28,816
How wonderful is it that Nala and I
get to continue his dream...

9
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,568
and make even greater the Circle of Life?

10
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,036
Nala, my love, I'm on my way.

11
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,658
Simba...

12
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,786
I'm here.

13
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,455
I'm here.

14
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,013
Security detail has arrived!

15
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,681
One gentle reminder: we are not food.

16
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,851
No, no, no. We are just two guys...

17
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,311
walking to work
through a pride of hungry lions.

18
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,189
Which is perfectly normal.
I'm not terrified.

19
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,735
Security detail reporting for duty,
Your Grace, Your Highness...

20
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,321
Ruler of all four-legged creatures.

21
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,698
And that one three-legged zebra.

22
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,118
Oh, right, Ron. That was tragic.

23
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,577
- It was an eat-and-Ron.
- Yeah.

24
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,663
Ron has three legs.
That's still one more than me.

25
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,873
- Well, are those arms or legs?
- Guys.

26
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,707
- I don't know. I think they're paws.
- Guys.

27
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,669
- I consider all those legs.
- Guys! This is serious.

28
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,754
I need you to stay with Kiara
until I get back.

29
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:20,551
Are you saying that your security detail
has been called on to do babysitting?

30
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,638
Pumbaa, we should really discuss this
because I don't really love...

31
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:26,266
Guys, I promised her
everything would be okay.

32
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,559
Well, that's one way to parent.

33
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,768
She's gonna have to grow up sometime.

34
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,521
What else did you tell her, that she
could be whatever she wants to be?

35
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,730
That life is fair?

36
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,192
I need you two to try
and act like adults, okay?

37
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,403
Don't scare Kiara.
And most of all, no stories.

38
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,030
- No stories?
- Wait a second.

39
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,740
I know where your head goes.
I grew up with you two. Promise me.

40
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,702
Okay. You know what, you know what,
you know what? Fine. No stories.

41
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,245
Speak for yourself, Pumbaa.

42
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,456
No. We'll tell a story anyway.

43
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,041
Okay, we'll tell him that
we're not gonna tell a story and then...

44
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,085
- we're gonna tell a story.
- Are you guys serious?

45
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,794
- He can't stop us.
- I'm clearly within earshot.

46
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,088
Dad.

47
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,258
Hey, little one.

48
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,471
Dad, the storm's coming, and I'm scared.

49
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,139
I wanna go with you and Mom.

50
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,850
Don't be scared, my love.

51
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,060
Timon and Pumbaa
will watch you while I'm gone.

52
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,686
Be brave now, Kiara.

53
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,314
Be brave.

54
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,404
Okay! We've prepared a story.

55
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,950
<i>Scar looked at us.</i>

56
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,202
<i>He knew it was the end of the line.</i>

57
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,204
<i>I could smell the fear.</i>

58
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,498
<i>That was actually me, but yes.</i>

59
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,143
<i>So you two defeated Scar?</i>

60
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,394
And then you ate him?

61
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,562
Honestly, one of the best meals I ever had.

62
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,648
My dad told me he defeated Scar.

63
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,776
Well, okay. But your dad,
as we all know, is a pathological liar.

64
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,029
He's always lyin'. Get it?

65
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,700
I'm scared. I want Mom and Dad.

66
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,994
Look, look, look.

67
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,787
Don't be scared, Kiara.

68
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:14,374
How about we sing you a song?
And, a-one...

69
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,044
Pumbaa, no, it is way too early for the song.

70
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,671
It worked on Simba.
He thought he had murdered his own father.

71
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,673
He was singin' and dancin' around in seconds.

72
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,801
I can't just turn it on like that.
I have to be in the moment.

73
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,178
He sang that song for six years straight.

74
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,762
Well, who didn't?

75
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,472
- Look!
- No!

76
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,433
It's Ron, the three-legged zebra.

77
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,726
- Run for your lives!
- He heard what we've been sayin' about him.

78
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,688
We're sorry, Ron. They were jokes.
They were just jokes!

79
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,315
It's Rafiki.

80
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,317
Rafiki! Rafiki!

81
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,238
Little one, there's no reason to cry.

82
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,406
My parents...

83
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:47,950
they're gone.

84
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,618
Look out there, <i>mdogo.</i>

85
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,663
You see those baobab trees
blowing in the wind?

86
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:58,460
The roots of those trees are very strong,
like your family.

87
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,503
And, just as they did for you...

88
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,174
your parents have gone
to the ceremonial birthing grounds.

89
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:10,472
And when they return, the Circle of Life
will bring a blessing to you, Kiara...

90
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,975
that you will never forget.

91
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:13,976
Man, he's good.

92
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,893
He's such a visual storyteller.

93
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,146
Yet it makes sense that he lives alone.

94
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:23,443
I just want the storm to pass,
and then I promise to be brave.

95
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,154
I'll tell you a secret.

96
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,698
When your father Simba was your age...

97
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,702
he was afraid of the thunder
and would hide behind the king.

98
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,079
When did he stop hiding?

99
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,331
One day, during a big storm...

100
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:41,628
your grandfather Mufasa took your father
to the very top of Pride Rock...

101
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,296
told him to stand with him...

102
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,340
and howl into the wind.

103
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,301
And Simba slowly stepped out with the king.

104
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,804
And together, they roared into the night.

105
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,642
But I'm not brave like my dad.

106
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,145
And I could never be like Mufasa.

107
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,938
Is that so?

108
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,651
Then maybe it's time I tell you a story.

109
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,945
A story of a cub, not much bigger than you.

110
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,616
A lion born without a drop
of nobility in his blood.

111
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:15,620
A lion who would change our lives forever.

112
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,331
A story! So glad I brought some crickets.

113
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,208
But go easy. We're in a cave.

114
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,002
This story begins far beyond...

115
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,004
the mountains and the shadows.

116
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,964
On the other side of the light.

117
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:31,386
In this place,
everything was dying of thirst...

118
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:36,058
as 20 full moons had passed
without a single drop of water.

119
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,975
But when the skies finally opened...

120
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:41,521
destiny would reign.

121
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,177
Mufasa.

122
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,763
Mufasa! Come see.

123
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,397
Mom, what is that light way out there?

124
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,234
Oh, that's very special.

125
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,026
Beyond the horizon...

126
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,322
beyond the last cloud in the sky...

127
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,283
that's a place we call <i>Milele.</i>

128
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,493
<i>Milele?</i>

129
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,953
It means, "forever."

130
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,207
Imagine a kingdom full of life...

131
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,001
water and food...

132
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,963
grass and sky as far as the eye can see.

133
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,257
Will we ever go there?

134
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,883
Oh, yes, Mufasa.

135
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,051
That's exactly where we're headed.

136
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,222
But we can also be there right now.

137
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,307
We can close our eyes.

138
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,768
Let our dreams take us.

139
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,778
<i>Beyond the horizon</i>

140
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,657
<i>Beyond the last cloud in the sky</i>

141
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,327
<i>There's a place I know</i>

142
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,792
<i>Imagine a kingdom</i>

143
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,962
<i>The water flows, the grass is high</i>

144
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,673
<i>It's not a dream</i>

145
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,885
<i>Someday we'll go</i>

146
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:42,392
<i>We call it Milele</i>

147
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,646
<i>It's always there</i>

148
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,232
<i>Milele</i>

149
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:54,487
<i>It lives in you, it lives in me</i>

150
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,407
<i>You'll see</i>

151
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,161
<i>- Life, great and small
- The Circle of Life is not small</i>

152
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,333
<i>- We know that there's enough for all
- There's enough for all</i>

153
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,961
<i>There is always more</i>

154
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,339
<i>- Can you feel it?
- Can you feel it?</i>

155
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,259
<i>- We're on your side
- We'll wander no longer</i>

156
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,846
<i>- We carry ancestors inside
- Like a constant tide</i>

157
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,350
<i>- It's not a dream, can you see it?
- On an endless shore</i>

158
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,853
<i>- And as you grow, can you find your way?
- Can you see it?</i>

159
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,939
<i>We call it</i>

160
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,443

00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,312
Wow.

171
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,529
What is this?

172
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,656
Rain. Rain!

173
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,949
Oh, finally we have rain!

174
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,163
Dad, race you to the light!

175
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:29,791
You're too fast.

176
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,543
I've never beaten you.

177
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,461
Nobody has ever beaten you.

178
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:35,297
I know!

179
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,801
Mufasa! Fastest cub in the world.

180
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,207
Thank you.

181
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:13,960
Mufasa...

182
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,002
that's enough.

183
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,797
Mufasa, come back now.

184
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,056
Mufasa, stay there! I'm coming, son.

185
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,280
- Father!
- Mufasa!

186
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,080
Mufasa?

187
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,708
I'll catch you on the turn.

188
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,292
Find my voice.

189
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,086
Find my voice!

190
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,254
Mom!

191
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:11,058
Mufasa, the cliff is too high,
but you can cross at the dam.

192
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,436
Come on, Mufasa, you can do this.

193
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,146
Find your mother's voice.

194
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,148
Listen to your father, Mufasa!

195
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,650
Listen to us!

196
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,737
Afia, he's there.

197
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,031
- Mom!
- He's there!

198
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,991
- Mother!
- Mufasa!

199
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,829
Find your footing one step at a time.

200
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,582
- I can't.
- You can do this. I'm right here.

201
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,056
Mufasa!

Please.

I'm scared.

<i>Beyond all that he knew.</i>

214
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,297
Hello.

215
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:50,176
I'm Taka, son of Obasi.
What's your name?

216
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,468
Mufasa.

217
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,345
I'm not allowed to talk to Outsiders...

218
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,222
but I have a secret...

219
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,391
and I really want to tell you.

220
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,393
- What's the secret?
- I'll get in trouble.

221
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:00,562
Please, just tell me.

222
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,354
I don't know.

223
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,565
Just tell me!

224
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,900
Okay. You're about to be eaten.

225
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,279
I hate secrets!

226
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,574
- Swim!
- But I can't!

227
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,367
- You have to swim.
- I don't know how!

228
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,621
All right. Chin up,
then walk underwater really fast.

229
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:19,997
I can't!

230
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,625
Come on, Mufasa. Faster!

231
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,336
Help me, Taka! Help me!

232
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,435
I told you to wait for me.

233
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,895
It's not my fault, Mum.

234
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,564
I came down for a drink
and saw him floating by.

235
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:46,983
I'd like you to meet Mufasa.

236
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:51,362
You're lucky those crocs were young
and afraid to fight. Let's go!

237
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,030
We can't just leave him here.

238
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,949
Rules are rules, Taka.

239
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,451
Obasi will never accept a stray.

240
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:01,372
I'm not a stray. I'm just... lost.

241
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,539
See?

242
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,959
He's just lost.

243
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,378
There was a flood.

244
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,172
My parents, they tried to save me.

245
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,761
Do you know which way is home?

246
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,639
Home?

247
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,767
To be lost is to learn the way.

248
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:22,852
Call me Eshe.

249
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,103
I'm tired, Eshe.

250
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,230
Come on, it's this way.

251
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,082
Come on, Mufasa.

252
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,093
Is this <i>Milele?</i>

253
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,304
No, my love.

254
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,228
I was trying to nap, Eshe.

255
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,731
The all-important nap of kings...

256
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,525
only to be awoken by the disgusting...

257
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:14,278
hideous, revolting stench of a stray.

258
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,571
When we come upon an Outsider...

259
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,115
tell me, what do we do?

260
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,034
Obasi, I know.

261
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,202
Eat it.

262
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,121
But I found him, Dad. I saved his life.

263
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,834
Taka, we do not associate with Outsiders.

264
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,837
The only true bond is blood.

265
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,923
I've heard stories of lions twice our size.

266
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,674
These Outsiders...

267
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,219
will devour everything in their path.

268
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,888
Does he look like he's going to devour you?

269
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,976
That smell is disgusting.

270
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,311
I'm not even sure I could eat this <i>kibeti!</i>

271
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,396
I'm not a <i>kibeti.</i> I'm a Mufasa.

272
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,858
- Do you even know what "Mufasa" means?
- No.

273
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,025
It means, "king."

274
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,610
And that's me.

275
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,196
You better start running, little Mufasa...

276
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,364
for your life.

277
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,574
If I run, you'll never catch me.

278
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,201
I'm the fastest cub that ever lived.

279
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,410
My father told me so.

280
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,122
Taka, you have a challenge.

281
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,833
They will race to the dead tree and back.

282
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,960
And when the prince defeats him...

283
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,587
I will finish him in one bite.

284
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,714
What if Mufasa wins?

285
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,176
If he wins, he lives, Obasi.

286
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,552
He stays with me.

287
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,513
You have my word.

288
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,059
Let the race begin!

289
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,812
Clumsy little stray.

290
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,397
Run, Mufasa!

291
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,149
You did not have to do that.

292
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,151
Taka is the future king.

293
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,236
He has to win his first challenge.

294
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,614
No, Obasi. To be a true king,
he must earn it.

295
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,283
Don't take that away from him.

296
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,716
Better hurry.

297
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,867
I have one more secret, Mufasa.

298
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,495
I always wanted a brother.

299
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,264
Cheater!

300
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,306
Obasi!

301
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,351
You will keep him with the females.

302
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:37,273
Taka, how could you lose to a stray?

303
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,942
Well done, Taka.

304
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,485
Well done.

305
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,155
I thought you said you were fast.

306
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,406
I had to let you win.

307
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,449
Well, I did just go days with no sleep
while riding the waves of...

308
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,202
Anyway, come on, Mufasa.
Let's get in some trouble.

309
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,999
<i>When I am king</i>

310
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,335
<i>No other animal will break my stride</i>

311
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,254
<i>Break my stride</i>

312
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,714
<i>- And my brother
- My brother</i>

313
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,592
<i>When I'm king, you'll always take my side</i>

314
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,679
<i>- Ha! Yeah, right
- That's right</i>

315
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,681
<i>- When I am king

316

<i>No other animal will break our pride</i>

317
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,937
<i>Break our pride</i>

00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,022
<i>- And my brother
- My brother</i>

<i>Our prey may run away,
but they can't hide</i>

320
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,235
<i>Watch your hide</i>

321
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,903
<i>Let's go, let's go</i>

322
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,113
<i>Let's go</i>

323
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,784
<i>Hey, did your mama say
you could be up this late?</i>

324
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:32,619
<i>Okay, she didn't say either way</i>

325
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,955
<i>Hide away, let's go</i>

326
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:38,417
<i>Hey, did your father say
you could be out this far?</i>

327
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:39,710
<i>Okay, we're on our way</i>

328
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,545
<i>On our way, run away
Let's go</i>

329
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:46,258
<i>Hey, did your mama say
you could be up this late?</i>

330
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,509
<i>Ha ha, you're very sharp</i>

331
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,261
<i>Yes, you are,
yes, you are, let's go</i>

332
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:54,183
<i>Hey, did your father say
you could be out this far?</i>

333
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,852
<i>Make a wish on the brightest star
And I say</i>

334
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:00,647
<i>I always wanted a brother
I always wanted a brother</i>

335
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,650
<i>I always wanted a brother
just like you</i>

336
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,487
<i>And I always wanted a brother</i>

337
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,364
<i>I always wanted a brother</i>

338
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,658
<i>I always wanted a brother
just like you</i>

339
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:12,868
<i>You see that tree?</i>

340
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,830
<i>Those birds are watching the world unfold</i>

341
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:19,166
<i>The world unfold</i>

342
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,377
<i>- Oh, brother
- My brother</i>

343
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,255
<i>When I'm king, they will do as they're told</i>

344
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,133
<i>You may look down on them</i>

345
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,967
<i>- But they are free
- You can't catch me</i>

346
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:32,054
<i>And where they go
cannot be controlled</i>

347
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,848
<i>No one looks down on me</i>

348
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:37,101
<i>They look down on us, brother</i>

349
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,770
<i>Some things you chase
but you cannot hold</i>

350
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,274
<i>- Okay, it's getting old, let's go
- Let's go</i>

351
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,362
<i>Hey, did your mama say
that you could learn this way?</i>

352
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,156
<i>I've got to find a way, find our prey</i>

353
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,490
<i>- Fine, I'll wait
- Let's go</i>

354
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,160
<i>- Hey
- I heard his father say</i>

355
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,328
<i>He doesn't want this stray</i>

356
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,872
<i>I dare you to say that again to my face</i>

357
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,624
<i>What did you say 'bout my brother?</i>

358
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,459
<i>That's not a stray, that's my brother</i>

359
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:06,088
<i>You stay away from my brother
'cause I say so</i>

360
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,382
<i>If you put your paws on my brother</i>

361
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,301
<i>You'll meet the jaws of his brother</i>

362
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,553
<i>Those are the laws for my brother</i>

363
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,430
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

364
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:25,857
<i>I always wanted a brother</i>

365
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:29,820
<i>I still remember my mother</i>

366
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:33,657
<i>One season after another</i>

367
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:37,661
<i>One season after another</i>

368
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:41,457
<i>One season after another</i>

369
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:45,294
<i>One season after another</i>

370
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,045
<i>- Everyone sing for my brother
- Hey</i>

371
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,131
<i>- I'd do anything for my brother
- Hey</i>

372
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,966
<i>- Soon I'll be king with my brother
- Hey</i>

373
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,051
<i>- By my side
- Hey</i>

374
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,011
<i>- I always wanted a brother
- Hey</i>

375
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,805
<i>- Now we rely on each other
- Hey</i>

376
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,057
<i>- One season after another
- Hey</i>

377
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,393
<i>- Hey, Mufasa
- Yes, Taka?</i>

378
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,479
<i>- I'll race you to the other side
- Hey</i>

379
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,397
<i>- Race you to the other side
- Hey</i>

380
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,941
<i>Race you to the other side
Ha!</i>

381
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,284
Elephant stampede!

382
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,035
Run for your lives!

383
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,881
Chigaru jumped, like, 20 feet.

384
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,216
Oh, that's a new record.

385
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,510
Obasi, they did it again.

386
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,512
Your sons are nothing but trouble.

387
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,680
That one is not my son.

388
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,766
They're heathens, the both of them.

389
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,145
This stray is forbidden
to be near the Shade Tree.

390
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,562
Mufasa and I were just playing.

391
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,232
You two will never be brothers.

392
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:49,775
Now go back to the females...

393
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,653
and stay away from my son.

394
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,615
Oh, your mother, she adopts every lizard...

395
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,117
speaks to passing grasshoppers.

396
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,286
I want to go with him.

397
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,078
You want to be with the females?

398
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,830
You belong with the males.

399
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,791
He gets to hunt with Mother.

400
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,544
One day, he will betray you.

401
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,297
That is what strays do.

402
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,881
Mufasa would never betray me.

403
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,341
Hey, hey.

404
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,261
This will all be yours, my son.

405
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,763
You will be king.

406
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,182
So pay attention.

407
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,726
Study every move I make.

408
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,729
Sleeping again.

409
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:28,980
That is what males do.

410
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,318
We protect the pride as we nap.

411
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,735
That's...

412
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,696
Well, that's power.

413
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,034
Power?

414
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,343
Why are we stopping?

415
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,177
Close your eyes.

416
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,638
And tell me what you hear.

417
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,516
What you feel.

418
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:14,443
There's a herd of antelope
heading across the dry lakebed.

419
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,321
About half a day from here?

420
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,531
And how do you know they're not gazelles?

421
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,784
Their steps are too heavy.

422
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,246
- Moving way too slow.
- What else?

423
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,831
Come on. You can do it.

424
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:33,712
When the wind hits their horns,
it moves up...

425
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,758
instead of across.
So, definitely antelope horns.

426
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,426
Very good.

427
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,851
What is it, Mufasa? What's wrong?

428
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,853
Sometimes I get a scent.

429
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,398
It's barely a trace on the wind.

430
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,149
And it smells like home.

431
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,738
Then it's gone.

432
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:03,909
Mufasa, your parents are still out there.
We can keep looking.

433
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,286
I lost them, Eshe.

434
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,579
You're wasting your time
training me like this.

435
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,624
But these skills you have,
no other male has them.

436
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,001
Obasi will never accept me.

437
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,671
I'll never be his blood. His family.

438
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:20,301
But you are my family.
And if Obasi could see how gifted you are...

439
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,345
Well, maybe I like being a stray, you know.

440
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:26,056
No rules, no responsibility.

441
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,724
I'm the lucky one, Eshe.

442
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,267
What do you mean, Mufasa?

443
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:31,437
I never have to be like Taka.

444
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,064
I never have to be king.

445
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,413
Did he say, "no rules and no responsibility"?

446
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,915
An outcast, afraid of water,
never takes a bath.

447
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,459
Which means he smells like me.

448
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,876
Which is not good.

449
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,921
Well, either way,
I think that means that he's one of us.

450
00:29:58,589 --> 00:29:59,798
- This is it.
- It's our time!

451
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,093
- This is our moment.
- And a-one, and a-two and a-one, two...

452
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,136
<i>Hakuna Mufasa</i>

453
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,514
<i>What a wonderful name</i>

454
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,558
<i>Hakuna Mufasa</i>

455
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,977
<i>He ain't no passin' craze</i>

456
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,228
<i>It means no...</i>

457
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,563
- Stop!
- What?

458
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,981
Don't go there.

459
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,650
All right, all right, Rafiki's right.
We'll get letters from legal.

460
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,527
Those vultures will take everything we have.

461
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:22,446
Which, technically, is nothing.

462
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:23,822
Look at us. We're naked animals.

463
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,281
No wonder I'm always freezing.

464
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,493
- They want this!
- Come on, Pumbaa.

465
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,660
Let's bring it home.

466
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,120
<i>Hakuna Mufasa</i>

467
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,162
Quiet!

468
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,665
Kiara's a music snob.

469
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,751
Rafiki, keep going.

470
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:43,216
<i>Later that day, Eshe was teaching Mufasa
how to hunt in pairs.</i>

471
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:47,388
<i>But, as Taka was secretly watching...</i>

472
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,973
<i>something terrible was hunting them.</i>

473
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:46,530
Mufasa, run!

474
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:49,908
Eshe!

475
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:51,702
Mother.

476
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:53,954
Mother!

477
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,164
Eshe!

478
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,306
Keep moving, Mufasa.

479
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,101
They go for the neck!

480
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:35,954
It's okay, Mufasa.

481
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:38,039
It's okay.

482
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,792
It's okay.

483
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,461
That was very brave of you, Mufasa.

484
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:44,630
Thank you.

485
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,263
Eshe...

486
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,806
What has happened?

487
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,268
Are you hurt?

488
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,438
They were huge. White as ghosts.

489
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,107
Like nothing I've seen before.

490
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,778
Obasi.

491
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,615
Had Mufasa not been there, I...

492
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:17,579
Taka.

493
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:31,301
I owe you a great debt, Mufasa.

494
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:33,804
We need to prepare.

495
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,557
They're downwind less than a day away.

496
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,850
No.

497
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,894
You couldn't possibly know this.

498
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:43,313
Send a scout and you'll see...

499
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,732
they'll be coming for us.

500
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:47,943
Chigaru.

501
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,488
Father, please, let me explain.

502
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,490
No. Not now.

503
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:57,994
Taka, come.

504
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,266
Where is my son?

505
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,352
There was a young lion, Majesty.

506
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,729
He fought Shaju.

507
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,899
And yet you came back.

508
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,902
You survived.

509
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,155
I was badly hurt. I promise, Majesty.
This is the truth.

510
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,532
- The truth?
- Yes, the truth.

511
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,995
The truth is standing behind you.

512
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,752
- There were others, Majesty.
- No, no, no.

513
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,712
But only one left blood on his mane.

514
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,297
Which means he left Shaju to die.

515
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,758
Saved himself.

516
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,802
This young lion, was he their king?

517
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,428
His blood is common. Ordinary.

518
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:58,597
Answer me!

519
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,808
Was he their king?

520
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:06,479
No, Kiros, you are the only king.

521
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,691
An ordinary lion?

522
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:12,694
And you left my son to die?

523
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,738
I was injured. There was no choice.

524
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:16,948
Please, Majesty, you have to believe me.

525
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,200
There's no reason to fear me.

526
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,828
I would never harm one of my own.

527
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,122
Thank you, Majesty.

528
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,875
I'll leave that pleasure...

529
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,043
to them.

530
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,672
Majesty! No. Kiros!

531
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,298
Kiros!

532
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:47,395
<i>No one can ever know you ran.
That you ran from your mother.</i>

533
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,606
It never happened, Taka.
Do you understand?

534
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:52,859
But I didn't know.
I was just... I was just scared.

535
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,988
It doesn't matter.
We must protect the bloodline.

536
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,241
Protect it with a lie?
Father, that's deceitful.

537
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:04,579
Deceit is a tool of a great king.

538
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,123
Taka...

539
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:11,044
it's what kings must do.

540
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:12,838
But I'm not a king.

541
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,589
I'm just your son.

542
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,049
Obasi!

543
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,301
Chigaru.

544
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,469
Obasi!

545
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:23,807
Chigaru, I'm here. What did you see?

546
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,475
They're coming this way, Obasi.

547
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,560
Two lions for every one of ours.

548
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:29,395
Each one bigger than the next...

549
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:33,524
but none as mighty as Kiros,
their terrifying king.

550
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,485
Outsiders.

551
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,946
The stories were all true.

552
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,199
I must protect the bloodline, Eshe.

553
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,243
The future of this pride.

554
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,246
Taka, you are that future.

555
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,248
Future? Dad, what do you mean?

556
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,458
I'm sending you away.

557
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,543
Far from here.

558
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:57,507
You will leave and start a new life,
a new beginning.

559
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,843
I need you to go with him, Mufasa...

560
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,636
to pledge your loyalty.

561
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,180
They'll arrive with the sunrise.

562
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,315
Where will we go, Eshe?

563
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,942
Without you, I have no home.

564
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:19,195
Mufasa, you and Taka together. That...

565
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,239
- That is home.
- Eshe...

566
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,074
Mufasa, look out there.

567
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,826
Beyond the light...

568
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,286
You know what I see?

569
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:31,082
I see the place your mother told you about,
a place beyond the river's end.

570
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,544
Across the deepest canyon
on the other side of the mountains...

571
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,130
a place beyond the horizon itself.

572
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,465
A pride land so green...

573
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,468
so perfect...

574
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,680
that to see it is to see...

575
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,015
<i>Milele.</i>

576
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,767
Yes. Forever.

577
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:54,022
My parents spoke of <i>Milele</i> often.
My mother told me it was where we were going.

578
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,690
And don't you see, Mufasa?

579
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:56,983
You must keep going.

580
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,402
You must continue your journey
toward the light.

581
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:02,405
Please, Eshe. I can't lose you.

582
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:05,200
You have my love always, Mufasa.

583
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,244
But your family is still out there,
waiting for you.

584
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,955
I can feel their presence.

585
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,789
And I know you can, too.

586
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,791
Go.

587
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,545
Go, Mufasa. Find your way home.

588
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:29,057
Mother, please forgive me. I beg you.

589
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,434
There's no need, my love.

590
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:34,479
Taka, your moment of courage will come.

591
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,572
Now both of you go.

592
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,575
Go and find your place...

593
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,577
in the Circle of Life.

594
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,348
They left their family
never to see them again?

595
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,682
This story is killing me.

596
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,393
It's toying with my emotions.

597
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,020
And here is the worst part.

598
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,897
- What's that?
- I'm out of crickets.

599
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,314
Oh, maybe that's for the best.

600
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,025
I need a bathroom break
before the second act.

601
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,651
Everyone wait for me.

602
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:27,908
I am back.

603
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,076
- Pumbaa, did you wash your hooves?
- Mm-hmm.

604
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:31,619
- Pumbaa?
- I did. I did.

605
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,038
- Pumbaa?
- I'm just gonna...

606
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,789
- walk on them again right after.
- Pumbaa?

607
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,377
Rafiki, did the Outsiders come?

608
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,545
Yes.

609
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,464
And as the hunters led Kiros
into the Valley of Kings...

610
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:47,010
<i>Obasi and Eshe stood their ground.</i>

611
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,817
Which one of you is king?

612
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,946
You have no reason to challenge me.

613
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:10,616
Does this look like a challenge, King?

614
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,453
There are rules among lions.

615
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,787
Not anymore.

616
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:18,458
While you ruled this pride,
I've built my army.

617
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,460
Yours is the last pride...

618
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:23,588
in the Valley of Kings, which means...

619
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:27,633
everything the light touches belongs to me.

620
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,469
There will be one ruler.

621
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:32,263
One Lion King.

622
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:43,483
<i>You say you're the king,
but you lie around in the shade</i>

623
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:46,111
<i>Out of shape, unafraid</i>

624
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:50,490
<i>The moon cuts a path through the sky</i>

625
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,742
<i>By night or by day</i>

626
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,120
<i>It doesn't obey</i>

627
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,497
<i>And neither do I</i>

628
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,166
<i>You took my son</i>

629
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:04,754
<i>I hope you can run</i>

630
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:09,009
<i>'Cause I'm going to be
the last thing you see</i>

631
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,094
<i>Before you go bye-bye</i>

632
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,513
<i>There you go, bye-bye</i>

633
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:18,143
<i>Climb every tree
Cross land and sea</i>

634
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,020
<i>I'll make you go bye-bye</i>

635
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,355
<i>I'll make you go bye-bye</i>

636
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:27,152
<i>Everything in my clutches, ha!
Bye-bye</i>

637
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,530
<i>Everything the light touches</i>

638
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,451
<i>The Circle of Life is a lie</i>

639
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,370
<i>A pretty way to say</i>

640
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:40,165
<i>There are predators and prey</i>

641
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:44,377
<i>That circle of vultures up high</i>

642
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,712
<i>They keep stealing glances</i>

643
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,923
<i>They don't like your chances</i>

644
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,384
<i>And neither do I</i>

645
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,762
<i>I run my pride</i>

646
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,516
<i>You run and hide</i>

647
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:03,020
<i>'Cause I'm going to be
the last thing you see</i>

648
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,022
<i>Before you go bye-bye</i>

649
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,317
<i>There you go, bye-bye</i>

650
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,029
<i>Climb every tree
Cross land and sea</i>

651
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:14,240
<i>Until you go bye-bye</i>

652
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:16,242
<i>Will you go bye-bye?</i>

653
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:20,705
<i>Bye-bye, for vengeance is mine</i>

654
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,542
<i>If I'm the last of my line</i>

655
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:30,506
<i>I must be strong</i>

656
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,882
<i>Gotta go bye-bye</i>

657
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:34,177
<i>I'll make you go bye-bye</i>

658
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:40,725
<i>Bye-bye</i>

659
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,111
We have to move. They'll be tracking us.

660
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,154
- Taka!
- What if you're wrong?

661
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:54,530
What if they're okay?

662
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,991
They live in you now.

663
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,993
Follow me, brother.

664
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,036
We have to move...

665
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,164
together.

666
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,399
Run, Mufasa.

667
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,109
Run!

668
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:34,362
Hunters.

669
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:35,863
What's the plan?

670
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,159
Run! Very fast!

671
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,166
This way!

672
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,056
Back to the trees.

673
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:03,891
We're trapped. We have to swim.

674
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,476
No, we have to fight.

675
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,102
If we fight, we die.

676
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,646
But if we swim, we drown.

677
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,898
Okay, I didn't want to do this...

678
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,150
- but I command you to swim!
- You what?

679
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:15,945
You pledged your loyalty.
I command you to swim.

680
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,614
Taka, this is not the time for jokes.

681
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:35,756
Which one of you killed my son?

682
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:39,009
I did. This lion with me
is nothing but a stray. Let him go.

683
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,886
Kiros, the other is no stray.

684
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,805
He holds the blood of the pride.

685
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:46,183
The last blood of the king?

686
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:50,896
Blood for blood.

687
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:08,664
They're coming!

688
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,416
What do we do?

689
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,876
We find the advantage?

690
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,630
What advantage?
We're on a rock in the middle of the water!

691
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:19,133
Taka, this is it. We go for the king.

692
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,810
Mufasa, I'm ready.

693
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:32,146
Just one last thing.

694
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:33,356
- What?
- Chin up!

695
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:36,066
Taka!

696
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:39,654
This was a bad idea.

697
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:48,788
Mufasa!

698
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,373
Mufasa!

699
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,174
- Mufasa, we're alive.
- Yeah!

700
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:02,552
I did it. I saved us.

701
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,847
You were saying?

702
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:37,127
Okay. Okay.

703
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,004
No more water.

704
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,215
Tell me you can track them down river.

705
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,634
We can track them anywhere.

706
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,387
They can run, but they can't hide.

707
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:50,182
So just to be clear, we're not in this story?

708
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:53,644
It feels a little bit like
Kiros is stealing my thunder here.

709
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,813
Yeah. You know, I don't feel seen.

710
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,483
No. There's a lotta stories with all of us.
Tell one of those!

711
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,443
Can I make one small suggestion?

712
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,195
Less childhood trauma, more meerkat.

713
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:06,073
Rafiki, I know who Taka's gonna be.

714
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,826
Me too. It's so obvious.

715
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:10,661
But maybe,
just so we're on the same page, tell me?

716
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,538
- Is it Simba? Is it me?
- Pumbaa.

717
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:14,499
Oh, wait. Am I Obasi?

718
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,876
That makes no sense.
But seriously, I have one question.

719
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,962
Am I Taka?

720
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,716
I did it again. I did it again.

721
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:27,762
Not that I'm counting,
but I saved your hide. Again!

722
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,974
As much as it kills you to say it,
let's hear a little, "Thank you, Taka."

723
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:35,936
You want me to thank you
for pushing me off a waterfall?

724
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,855
Yes, and you're welcome.

725
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:41,108
Look, it's not my fault
crocodiles are simply attracted to you.

726
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,360
Don't say that.

727
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:49,575
I did it again. I did it...

728
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,036
Mufasa.

729
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,705
Is it them? Is it the Outsiders?

730
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,749
No. She's right there.

731
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,042
"She"?

732
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,171
There's no place to run.

733
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,756
We have your scent.

734
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:05,090
My scent?

735
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:07,593
I've been stalking you two all night.

736
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,595
That's not possible.

737
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:12,640
Then why did I circle you
three times in this wood...

738
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:15,017
while you two
were chasing each other's tails?

739
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,163
That's embarrassing.

740
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:40,084
Yeah, well, I meant to do that, so...

741
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,169
Still think I'm afraid?

742
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,467
- Why are you following us?
- I was hoping to find my pride.

743
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,510
- What happened to them?
- The Outsiders happened.

744
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:53,764
A few of us got away,
but you're the only other lions I've seen.

745
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,016
You two better keep moving.

746
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,434
Wait! Please.

747
00:48:58,853 --> 00:48:59,854
My name is Taka.

748
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,732
Son of Obasi.

749
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,567
I know what it's like to lose everything.

750
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:05,985
Come with us. We can help you.

751
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:07,737
I don't need any help.

752
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,030
But you don't have anyone.

753
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,825
She does indeed have someone.
Thank you very much.

754
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:15,202
That's Zazu. Don't eat him.

755
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,829
You heard her. Do not eat me.

756
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:19,790
As a recent addition
to the King's Royal Guard...

757
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,752
I must kindly ask you both to move on.

758
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,670
Thank you for stopping by.

759
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:26,881
Your king hired a bird to protect you?

760
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,758
How high can you fly?

761
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:31,594
Look, I needed a scout.

762
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:33,345
Zazu was the last option.

763
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:35,055
Well, next to last.

764
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,057
Between Albert the Iguana and I...

765
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,811
His Majesty
decided on the underling with wings.

766
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,773
And thus, I became the lead scout
for the princess.

767
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,734
It's my third day, going swimmingly,
if I may say so myself.

768
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,193
Sarabi, you can say so as well.

769
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,945
How far do you think you'll get with a bird?

770
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:53,991
How far do you two geniuses think you'll get
stumbling around, running into each other?

771
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,076
All the way to <i>Milele.</i>

772
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,037
<i>- Milele</i> is nothing but a myth.
- It's not a myth.

773
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:00,289
Circle of Life and fairy tale herds.

774
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:02,374
- You're chasing something that doesn't exist.
- Honestly. As If.

775
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:05,002
I don't know that <i>Milele</i> exists,
but right now...

776
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:06,336
it's the only hope we have.

777
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,339
We don't need hope. We need food.

778
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:14,219
Good job, brother. Real nice.

779
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,347
There's trouble in the trees.
My first real trouble...

780
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,517
and I am going to pass. Not going.
I am staying right here, thank you.

781
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:23,896
Come on, Sarabi.
Looks like there's dinner headed our way.

782
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,148
Sarabi, if I may.

783
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:29,401
He makes a valid point, Your Highness.

784
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:32,071
But, on the other hand,
he's a starving lion, he wants to eat me...

785
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:33,488
so I am slightly torn.

786
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:38,953
I think that went quite well,
all things considered.

787
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:52,549
<i>And now, Kiara, this is where I come in.</i>

788
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,559
Rafiki.

789
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:05,771
Order! We will have order
in the Congress of Baboons.

790
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:09,399
Tonight, a cheetah came into our trees
for the third night in a row.

791
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,901
Almost took one of our own.

792
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,069
It was Rafiki's fault.

793
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,321
He summoned the beast with his dreams.

794
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:17,867
Rafiki and his visions
must be banished once and for all.

795
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,201
Rafiki tried to warn you.

796
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:23,080
His dreams conjure our enemies.
He talks to the spirits, summons the devil.

797
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:25,374
- What are you talking about?
- He's done it before.

798
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,501
His brother was chased
from these very trees...

799
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:28,794
never to be seen again.

800
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,170
Rafiki was just a child.

801
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:33,924
A child born with a leg that does not work.
Yet somehow, he survived?

802
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,551
It was Rafiki who found water
in the dry season.

803
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,054
Who healed you, Inaki, when you were sick.

804
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:42,307
He speaks to the insects,
converses with the moon.

805
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:45,435
Zala, you know what will happen
if you send him down from the trees.

806
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,396
He is <i>amelaaniwa!</i>

807
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,438
A curse to us all.

808
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,733
- That's not true.
- He doesn't belong here.

809
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,778
All in favor of banishment, cover one eye.

810
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,529
How can you trust him?

811
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,489
Don't trust him, and I don't trust his magic!

812
00:51:57,657 --> 00:51:58,615
He doesn't belong here.

813
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:00,534
He's not a baboon.
And he never will be.

814
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:02,119
He's not one of us.

815
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,246
And so, it is time.

816
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:05,706
No, wait.

817
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,750
Where will you go?

818
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:10,335
Where I should have gone long ago.

819
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,546
To find all that was lost.

820
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,298
My family.

821
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,591
You can't survive on your own.

822
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,093
Nobody can.

823
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,637
And yet, here we are.

824
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:23,891
Oh, Rafiki.

825
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:28,520
The eye never forgets
what the heart has seen.

826
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,167
It's all right.

827
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:27,287
You can try to run,
but I'm afraid you won't get very far.

828
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,248
And why would I run from you?

829
00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:31,959
Because we're lions.

830
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,837
As in lions!

831
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:39,341
A flea can trouble a lion
more than a lion can trouble a flea.

832
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:42,177
I don't think you understand
what's about to happen.

833
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,846
There's no place for you to go.

834
00:53:44,013 --> 00:53:45,806
I am going forward.

835
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,391
I seriously doubt that.

836
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:51,353
It is easy to doubt everything
when you know nothing.

837
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,605
Can we get on with this, please?

838
00:53:53,773 --> 00:53:57,067
If you take my life,
you will never find <i>Milele.</i>

839
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,986
Wait, did you say <i>Milele?</i>

840
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,989
That is where I'm going. Toward the light.

841
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:05,785
I have been there many times in my dreams.

842
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,953
My brother waits for me there.

843
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,454
I've seen the tree.

844
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,623
Can picture it. The two of us...

845
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:13,292
together again.

846
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,795
And why would anyone trust a baboon's dream?

847
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,213
Sometimes, a dream is all you have.

848
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,757
The only truth that lives in you.

849
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:23,385
Like the memory of a great king.

850
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:24,970
How did you know?

851
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:28,432
Okay. Help us get to <i>Milele,</i>
and we will let you live.

852
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,184
- Do we have a deal?
- No.

853
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,518
What? Why?

854
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,688
Rafiki will let you live.

855
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,982
I've had enough of this!

856
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:38,818
Taka, do not eat him.

857
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:41,946
Wonderful. Another misfit stray
we're not supposed to eat.

858
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,698
So, you expect us to follow this baboon...

859
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:47,284
to a place nobody has ever seen?

860
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,119
I'll be better off alone.

861
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,040
A single stick may smoke...

862
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,084
but it will never burn.

863
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,754
Okay, now that there's five of us...

864
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:02,507
why don't we all go around
and say a fun fact about ourselves?

865
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:03,675
I'll go first.

866
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:06,803
I once had a crush on a flamingo.

867
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:08,973
I've never said that out loud.

868
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,599
And they're walking away.

869
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,559
Yeah, places to go, kingdoms to see.

870
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,186
We're busy. Let's hustle.

871
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,740
Wait, wait, wait.
Now you're the star of this thing?

872
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,493
Someone's a little tired
of bein' second banana, huh?

873
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,954
All of a sudden,
there's a lotta Rafiki in this story.

874
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:33,998
You even gave yourself a long-lost brother.

875
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,958
- Yeah.
- What's next? A funny catchphrase?

876
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:38,127
You gonna be fartin' next?
'Cause that's my thing.

877
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,670
You cannot tell the story of Mufasa...

878
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,298
without the story of Rafiki.

879
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,842
Oh, now he's even talkin' about himself
in the third person.

880
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,261
Pretty soon, he'll have his own fragrance.

881
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,804
And I'm the only one
with a fragrance around here.

882
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,515
It's called "Pumbaa by Pumbaa"...

883
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,184
and from what I hear, it's pretty gross.

884
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,311
Mom? Dad?

885
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,106
If you can hear me, come home.

886
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,233
Please.

887
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:02,902
Come home.

888
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:11,660
Mother?

889
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:15,039
Mother?

890
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,544
<i>Milele.</i>

891
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:21,878
Mother!

892
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:41,606
Rafiki.

893
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,068
- What are you doing?
- I am fishing.

894
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,695
You're sitting on a rock
with your eyes closed.

895
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:50,115
My eyes are open.
It is my lids that are closed.

896
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,659
Why am I talking to a baboon?

897
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:56,580
I am not a baboon.
I am a mandrill.

898
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,458
No offense, but a monkey is a monkey.

899
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,043
And a stray is a stray.

900
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:02,169
What's that supposed to mean?

901
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:04,463
It means we are very much the same.

902
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,674
We are nothing alike.

903
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:11,178
Take a good look. I am a lion.

904
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:14,723
A lion who fears water,
fears his own reflection.

905
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:18,685
Who can't sleep because of what he sees
when he closes his eyes.

906
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,897
You are afraid of your dreams, Mufasa.

907
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:25,067
Afraid of what you see in them.

908
00:57:25,234 --> 00:57:27,652
I see my parents.

909
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:30,405
I feel them everywhere.

910
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,366
Of course you do, Mufasa.

911
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,577
You will feel them forever.

912
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:38,913
My mother, I hear her voice.

913
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:43,085
She tells me that
we are on a journey to <i>Milele...</i>

914
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:46,463
but I feel so lost without her.

915
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:50,092
Your journey is not a dream, Mufasa.

916
00:57:50,259 --> 00:57:52,052
Your mother is guiding you...

917
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:55,722
and where you are going,
a family awaits.

918
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:09,736
What are you doing?

919
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:11,238
We're starving.

920
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:12,822
'Twas not its time.

921
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:16,701
Instead, the fish has agreed
to let us share the water.

922
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,213
I have a report.

923
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:29,964
It's morning.

924
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,301
End of report.

925
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:42,727
The earth divided is now a choice.

926
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,479
Around or down?

927
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,773
The decision is yours.

928
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,738
Look out there, beyond the light.

929
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:57,326
Across the deepest canyon.

930
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,745
"Across the deepest canyon."

931
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:02,456
We should go down.

932
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:05,041
Why? Because of some fairy tale?

933
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:06,585
The rocks will hide our tracks.

934
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,212
It's safer to go around.

935
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,796
I picked up their scents.

936
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:12,466
The only thing you picked up
is a hallucinating baboon.

937
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,717
I am a mandrill.

938
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,260
This is a waste of time.

939
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:16,845
Close your eyes.

940
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,388
What?

941
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:21,266
Tell me what you see. What you feel.

942
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:22,809
There's nothing on the wind.

943
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,437
- No, they're moving through the bush willow.
- They, who?

944
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:28,440
The females, out front. Come on.

945
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,692
Clear your thoughts. Concentrate.

946
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:32,902
I am concentrating.

947
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:45,832
He's right.

948
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:48,877
We have to go down.

949
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:50,879
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

950
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:56,301
Now the many sticks will make fire as one.

951
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,388
Come on. We have places to go.

952
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,806
And kingdoms to see.

953
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,808
And kingdoms to see!

954
01:00:07,146 --> 01:00:09,564
<i>If you wanna go fast, go alone</i>

955
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:11,650
<i>There's the road</i>

956
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,693
<i>Off you go</i>

957
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:17,071
<i>But if you wanna go far</i>

958
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:18,948
<i>We go together</i>

959
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,909
<i>So good, so far</i>

960
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,744
<i>We go together</i>

961
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,372
<i>Your father left you in my care</i>

962
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:29,293
<i>And now we're running who knows where</i>

963
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:32,754
<i>Sometimes you need a bird's-eye view</i>

964
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:36,300
<i>And I've got you to see me through</i>

965
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,967
<i>By land, by air</i>

966
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,053
<i>If you wanna go fast, go alone</i>

967
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,137
<i>Day and night</i>

968
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:42,931
<i>- There's the road
- I just might</i>

969
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:45,099
<i>- Off you go
- Yeah, right</i>

970
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,769
<i>If you wanna go far</i>

971
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:49,688
<i>We go together</i>

972
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,648
<i>So good, so far</i>

973
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,650
<i>We go together</i>

974
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:57,612
<i>I will find my family again</i>

975
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:01,533
<i>I will walk with you until then</i>

976
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:05,329
<i>I will walk with you till the end</i>

977
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:08,748
<i>It's much easier with a friend</i>

978
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:13,212
<i>I will find my family again</i>

979
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:17,006
<i>I will walk with you until then</i>

980
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:20,469
<i>- I will walk with you till the end
- Flying through</i>

981
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:24,348
<i>It's much easier with a friend</i>

982
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,600
<i>Like the clouds and rain</i>

983
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:31,271
<i>Like a meal in a field of grain</i>

984
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:35,024
<i>Like the flecks of gold in your mane</i>

985
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:39,488
<i>Sarabi, you and me, we go together</i>

986
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:43,408
<i>- Like clouds and rain
- We will find our family again</i>

987
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:47,412
<i>- Like a meal in a field of grain
- We will walk together till then</i>

988
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:51,791
<i>- Like the flecks of gold in your mane, Sarabi
- We will find our way to the end</i>

989
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,919
<i>- You and me, we go together
- It's much easier with a friend</i>

990
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:58,923
<i>- My brother waits for me to find him
- We will find our family again</i>

991
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:02,761
<i>- My brother knows I'm right behind him
- We will walk together till then</i>

992
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:05,514
<i>- My brother tends to lose his way
- We will find our way</i>

993
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,098
<i>- And go astray, say
- To the end</i>

994
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:10,602
<i>- If you see my brother, please remind him
- It's much easier with a friend</i>

995
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,356
<i>It's much easier with a friend</i>

996
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:19,694
<i>It's much easier</i>

997
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,906
<i>- We won't go alone
- Not alone</i>

998
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,824
<i>- Here we go
- Here we go</i>

999
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,076
<i>- Down the road
- Down the road</i>

1000
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:29,621
<i>- 'Cause we're gonna go far
- Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

1001
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:31,581
<i>We go together</i>

1002
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,542
<i>- So good, so far
- Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

1003
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,585
<i>We go together</i>

1004
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:46,305
<i>As we headed across the Great Valley...</i>

1005
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,182
<i>the hunters tracked our every move.</i>

1006
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,812
Kiros. They are not alone.

1007
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:55,730
They've collected a lioness.

1008
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,191
And a monkey.

1009
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:09,328
Mufasa.

1010
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,413
Mufasa. You have to help me.

1011
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:12,456
Help you how?

1012
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,957
It's Sarabi, Mufasa.

1013
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,209
She is the light my mother spoke of.

1014
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:17,877
- What?
- She's special.

1015
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,547
The most amazing female
I've ever met in my life.

1016
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:23,800
I don't know what to say to her.
You've spent your life with females.

1017
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:25,844
Please, tell me what to say.

1018
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,221
Just talk to her. Be yourself.

1019
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:29,556
No, Mufasa.

1020
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:32,183
You don't understand.
Myself isn't good enough.

1021
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:33,727
You...

1022
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,937
just know things.

1023
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,523
Fine. Fine.

1024
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:41,610
Keep it simple. Ask her a question.

1025
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,571
Right. A question. This is good.

1026
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:48,367
Yeah, try to be confident. Disinterested.

1027
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:50,034
But I'm very interested.

1028
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:53,455
- Tell her about the flowers.
- What flowers?

1029
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:57,083
The valley she comes from.
There's flowers everywhere.

1030
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,210
They're called duck flowers.

1031
01:03:59,378 --> 01:04:01,004
Long stems.

1032
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,339
It's absolutely beautiful.

1033
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:05,049
How do you know that?

1034
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:08,261
When she passes, I can smell them on her fur.

1035
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,721
Okay.

1036
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,432
Flowers. Disinterested.

1037
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:15,351
- Flowers. And disinterested. Flowers.
- And here's the most important thing, okay?

1038
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:16,686
- And disinterested.
- Listen...

1039
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,522
- Flowers and disinterested.
- ...when she speaks.

1040
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,356
- Males have trouble with that one.
- Flowers...

1041
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:23,402
Sorry. What did you say?

1042
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:26,320
Really?

1043
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,657
I heard you, brother.

1044
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,034
I'm gonna make you proud.

1045
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:44,714
It's very hot, isn't it?

1046
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:46,174
Yep.

1047
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:50,637
I love listening.

1048
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:51,930
Okay.

1049
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:54,057
- I'm listening right now.
- To what?

1050
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,100
- What you just said.
- You're the one that's talking.

1051
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:57,268
I am.

1052
01:04:58,562 --> 01:05:00,063
- You smell like a duck.
- What?

1053
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:01,230
Flower.

1054
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:03,692
A duck flower.

1055
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,985
How do you know about those flowers?

1056
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:09,197
Well, I inhaled you with my nose.

1057
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:10,865
I can smell them.

1058
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,660
That's amazing.

1059
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,870
Our valley was full of those flowers...

1060
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,957
thousands of them
as far as the eye could see.

1061
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:22,293
It was the most beautiful place, Taka.

1062
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:24,963
Did he just say she smells like a duck?

1063
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:27,256
And you call me a baboon?

1064
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:44,190
They shouldn't be here.

1065
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:46,025
The migration patterns are broken.

1066
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,652
- I don't understand...
- Outsiders!

1067
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:50,279
This is not a drill! Just to be clear...

1068
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:53,241
I never signed up for this.

1069
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,911
It's okay. We're safe.

1070
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,454
They're on the other side.

1071
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:00,248
Nope!

1072
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:01,875
They can just jump across!

1073
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,502
We are trapped!

1074
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:04,794
What do we do?

1075
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,337
The elephants will fight with us.

1076
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:07,506
And why would they do that?

1077
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:10,091
Because I'm going to ask them.

1078
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:11,635
Got a better idea?

1079
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:14,638
Yes, Mr. Ask-Questions-First.

1080
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:15,847
Get ready to run.

1081
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:18,808
Where is she going?

1082
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,728
Hello? Listen to me, please.
We need your help.

1083
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,689
Can you talk with me?
We need your help. Please.

1084
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,567
They're coming!

1085
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,570
Sarabi! Sarabi, wait!

1086
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:33,239
Sarabi! Sarabi, wait. Wait!
Where is she going?

1087
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:37,160
She's going for the hive!

1088
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:40,830
Like I said, get ready to run!

1089
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,052
Run!

1090
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:56,137
Get to the trees!

1091
01:06:56,304 --> 01:07:00,099
Why am I running?

1092
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:29,128
Your Highness, hold on!

1093
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:30,964
Zazu!

1094
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:41,808
Sarabi!

1095
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,240
Stand your ground!

1096
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:58,992
Do not retreat!

1097
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:18,678
I got you.

1098
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:20,303
I got you.

1099
01:08:21,179 --> 01:08:23,391
Sarabi, I got you.

1100
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,526
That's right. Run along, little kitty cats.

1101
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:38,321
Thank you, my friend.

1102
01:08:56,174 --> 01:08:57,465
Over here.

1103
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,775
Sarabi.

1104
01:09:20,699 --> 01:09:23,201
Alive. She's alive!

1105
01:09:28,621 --> 01:09:30,166
Why are you all looking at me?

1106
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,500
You were thrown from the tree.

1107
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,838
He saved your life.

1108
01:09:35,879 --> 01:09:36,880
Who?

1109
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:37,924
Taka.

1110
01:09:39,007 --> 01:09:40,508
Taka saved you.

1111
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,553
Isn't that right, brother?

1112
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:47,600
You saved me?

1113
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:50,937
Well, I had to do something.

1114
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:52,270
Thank you.

1115
01:09:53,646 --> 01:09:54,898
We're lucky.

1116
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:57,318
Those bees almost killed us all.

1117
01:09:57,485 --> 01:09:59,070
Those bees saved our lives.

1118
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:00,654
- Mufasa.
- Really?

1119
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:03,491
Because it felt like an elephant stampede.

1120
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:05,910
- We're alive, aren't we?
- The elephants would have fought with us.

1121
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:07,120
We're lions.

1122
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,537
Nobody will fight with us.

1123
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:09,873
Not out here.

1124
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:19,924
Where's he going?

1125
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:22,719
Beyond the horizon itself.

1126
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,432
Mufasa, thank you.

1127
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:42,989
Rafiki...

1128
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:46,117
Who are the Outsiders?

1129
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:49,412
Well, the Outsiders come from many prides.

1130
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,289
But, when they are born...

1131
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:55,084
they are hated
because they are different from their tribe.

1132
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,627
Like you and your tribe?

1133
01:10:56,795 --> 01:10:58,379
Yes, just like me.

1134
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:00,714
- But, Rafiki?
- Yes?

1135
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:02,801
Why do they wanna hurt everybody?

1136
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:06,930
Sometimes, when the people most like you
don't love you...

1137
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:10,308
it is a hurt
that can cause the greatest pain.

1138
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:11,976
And this pain...

1139
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:15,521
can lead you to hate everything.

1140
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:18,274
I'm glad that didn't happen to you, Rafiki.

1141
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:20,985
Yes, my child. I'm glad too.

1142
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:23,612
Hi. We're here, too.

1143
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:25,531
Yeah, why are you leavin' us
outside this story...

1144
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:28,326
when I'm pretty sure
we are the ultimate outsiders.

1145
01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:30,536
- Come on!
- Yeah, we've always been misunderstood.

1146
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,121
I contain multitudes.

1147
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:40,546
There are many ways to <i>Milele.</i>

1148
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,632
But this will be ours.

1149
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:54,477
<i>Go. Go, Mufasa.</i>

1150
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,729
<i>Find your forever.</i>

1151
01:11:57,981 --> 01:11:59,690
<i>I got you.</i>

1152
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:02,026
Sarabi, I got you.

1153
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:23,422
Hey, Rafiki?

1154
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,341
What are you doing?

1155
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:28,970
I am confirming my vision, Mufasa.

1156
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:34,267
Can I ask you something, Rafiki?

1157
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,478
How many of your visions have come true?

1158
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:40,523
- So far, none.
- None?

1159
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:43,776
But it's not what I see. It's what I feel.

1160
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:45,653
But how do you...

1161
01:12:46,154 --> 01:12:48,781
How do you know
when you should follow a feeling?

1162
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,117
<i>Milele</i> exists.

1163
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:53,953
I feel it in here.

1164
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:55,621
The question is...

1165
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,166
what do you feel, Mufasa...

1166
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,793
in there?

1167
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:21,397
The weather's shifted.

1168
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:23,232
There's not enough fresh snow.

1169
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:27,861
Hey, if the Outsiders find our tracks,
they'll follow them to <i>Milele.</i>

1170
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:30,573
Zazu, only you can help us now.

1171
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,533
Are you quite sure about that?

1172
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:33,742
No, I was actually thinking...

1173
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,494
that Rafiki looks pretty handy,
and with the stick...

1174
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:37,038
Zazu, you can use your wings...

1175
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:38,872
to cover our tracks
as we head up the mountain...

1176
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,416
without leaving a trace.

1177
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:42,501
Hey, you can do this.

1178
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:44,503
Yeah.

1179
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,797
Yes, sir. You're right. I've got this.

1180
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:52,886
Okay. It's just me against a frozen mountain.

1181
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:55,723
One hornbill
charged with saving the future...

1182
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:57,641
Mummy!

1183
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,812
Man alive, that's cold.

1184
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:17,370
Now what's happening?

1185
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,580
We can't keep stopping.

1186
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:22,125
Somehow, they have covered their tracks.

1187
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,709
In the snow?

1188
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,503
It's not possible.

1189
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:27,838
Majesty, they could be anywhere
on this mountain...

1190
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:29,048
Then find them!

1191
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:30,258
Now.

1192
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:32,343
<i>Zazu, Zazu, Zazu</i>

1193
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,512
<i>Zazu, Zazu!</i>

1194
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:40,684
I have a report.

1195
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:43,646
The Outsiders are completely lost.

1196
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:44,897
Well played, Mufasa.

1197
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:46,232
Great job, Zazu.

1198
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,400
And as per usual.

1199
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:48,817
I knew you could do it.

1200
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:51,237
We did it. We did it.

1201
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:53,781
No, you did it.

1202
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:55,699
Great thinking, Mufasa.

1203
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:58,411
We're all rubbing off on each other.
Perfectly normal thing to do.

1204
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:00,288
Who wants to rub against Zazu?

1205
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:01,997
No one. I'm leaving now.

1206
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:03,332
I'll scout ahead.

1207
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,848
I got you, Rafiki.

1208
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:21,225
- Hey.
- I got you.

1209
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:22,643
<i>Ho monate,</i> Mufasa.

1210
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:24,019
Yeah, I got you.

1211
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:30,109
Mufasa...

1212
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:32,945
"I got you."

1213
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:49,837
Hidden in the shadows,
downwind, light of foot.

1214
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:52,506
Interesting hunting style, Mufasa.

1215
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:55,926
We have to eat something
before we take on that descent.

1216
01:15:56,094 --> 01:15:58,221
Unfortunately,
there's nothing to hunt up here.

1217
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,555
See under that rock?

1218
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:02,183
There's a civet about to leave his den.

1219
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,353
Of course you can smell a civet
hidden in the snow.

1220
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:08,606
You, the lion who can do anything.

1221
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:10,524
What's that supposed to mean?

1222
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:13,319
It means I see you, Mufasa.

1223
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:15,404
I don't know what you're talking about.

1224
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:16,905
Now, that part, I believe.

1225
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:19,200
Because, smart as you are...

1226
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,161
you have a way of seeing
everything but yourself.

1227
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:23,704
What is this?

1228
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:25,539
What is this, Sarabi?

1229
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:29,001
There is a civet in the snow
right where you said it would be.

1230
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:31,086
And you smelled the Outsiders
on the wind...

1231
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:33,547
which means you're the one
who smelled the flowers on my fur.

1232
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:34,715
It was a lucky guess.

1233
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:37,092
You can smell the exact flower
from my valley.

1234
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,137
No, that's not possible.

1235
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:40,679
You saved me.

1236
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:43,307
Held me, covered me in the stampede,
comforted me.

1237
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:44,475
No, it was Taka.

1238
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:46,602
"I got you. I got you, Sarabi."

1239
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:48,896
- I'm here to protect him.
- That was you.

1240
01:16:49,062 --> 01:16:52,150
I was lost in the water, and he found me.
My brother saved me.

1241
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:53,817
I sensed it from the beginning.

1242
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:56,779
- His blood is the blood of the king.
- Mufasa.

1243
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,947
- That is his destiny.
- No!

1244
01:16:59,282 --> 01:17:01,325
His destiny was to save you.

1245
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:06,872
Now tell me it's you.

1246
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,804
<i>Ever since you appeared</i>

1247
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:26,434
<i>I've been running from something
deep inside</i>

1248
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,269
<i>And it's worse than I feared</i>

1249
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:32,940
<i>'Cause I look in your eyes
and I can't hide</i>

1250
01:17:33,106 --> 01:17:35,901
<i>- I push you away
- Don't push me away</i>

1251
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:39,154
<i>But the feelings come back
just twice as strong</i>

1252
01:17:39,322 --> 01:17:42,283
<i>- I don't know what to say
- You know just what to say</i>

1253
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:45,286
<i>But I know that I'm right where I belong</i>

1254
01:17:45,453 --> 01:17:47,371
<i>The way you know just where to be</i>

1255
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:50,583
<i>- I don't know
- The way you move, the way you see</i>

1256
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:54,169
<i>- You see me
- The way you feel when you're with me</i>

1257
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:58,591
<i>- Beside me
- Don't hide from me anymore</i>

1258
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:01,552
<i>Tell me it's you, I know it's you</i>

1259
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:03,221
<i>What do I say?
Where do I go?</i>

1260
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:04,680
<i>How do I know you feel the same?</i>

1261
01:18:05,223 --> 01:18:07,850
<i>Tell me it's you, I know it's you</i>

1262
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:10,811
<i>Quiet and low, letting it go,
letting you know it's in me</i>

1263
01:18:11,229 --> 01:18:13,356
<i>Ev'rywhere that I roam</i>

1264
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:17,568
<i>I remind myself not to overstay</i>

1265
01:18:17,735 --> 01:18:19,570
<i>Ev'ry time I find home</i>

1266
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:23,991
<i>Something happens to take that home away</i>

1267
01:18:24,157 --> 01:18:25,701
<i>But you've seen what I've seen</i>

1268
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:28,036
<i>- I see you
- As you lead with</i>

1269
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:30,456
<i>A strength that shines right through</i>

1270
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:33,334
<i>You move like a queen, a true queen</i>

1271
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:37,129
<i>Don't let anything take me away from you</i>

1272
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:39,757
<i>Tell me it's you, I know it's you</i>

1273
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:41,634
<i>Say it again, say it again</i>

1274
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,427
<i>Tell me I'll always be with you</i>

1275
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:46,389
<i>- Tell me it's you
- I know it's you</i>

1276
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:47,973
<i>Say it again, say it again</i>

1277
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,517
<i>Tell me you're always with me</i>

1278
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:52,227
<i>- The way you know just where to be
- Now I know</i>

1279
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:55,523
<i>- The way you move, the way you see
- I see you</i>

1280
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:58,025
<i>The love I feel when you're with me</i>

1281
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:01,570
<i>Beside me, beside me</i>

1282
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:03,989
<i>Say it again, say it again, say it again</i>

1283
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,616
<i>Tell me the world won't interfere</i>

1284
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:07,200
<i>Say it again, say it again</i>

1285
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:08,827
<i>Tell me the words I wanna hear</i>

1286
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:10,413
<i>Say it again, say it again</i>

1287
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:14,417
<i>Open your eyes and here we go</i>

1288
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:19,004
<i>I know it's you</i>

1289
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:26,261
<i>I know it's you</i>

1290
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:58,419
<i>You know I love her, my brother</i>

1291
01:19:58,586 --> 01:20:03,716
<i>There's nothing we keep from each other</i>

1292
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:06,844
<i>I saved your life</i>

1293
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:12,558
<i>This is how you repay me?</i>

1294
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:17,187
<i>What do I do?
What does it mean?</i>

1295
01:20:17,355 --> 01:20:19,607
<i>How do I ever unsee
what I've seen?</i>

1296
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:22,234
<i>He was my kin
She was my queen</i>

1297
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:24,027
<i>Now it's broken forever and...</i>

1298
01:20:24,612 --> 01:20:26,822
<i>"Tell her it's you!
She knows it's you!"</i>

1299
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:29,157
<i>What did you say to her?
What did you do?</i>

1300
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:31,660
<i>I'm next in line
She should be mine, ha!</i>

1301
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:33,662
<i>Are the ancestors laughing, I...</i>

1302
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:36,499
<i>What would they say?
Father is gone</i>

1303
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,959
<i>Not before giving me strength to go on</i>

1304
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:40,461
<i>He never trusted you!</i>

1305
01:20:40,628 --> 01:20:43,506
<i>Did he know
you'd betray me so?</i>

1306
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:46,008
<i>When you were drowning
I pulled you out</i>

1307
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:48,218
<i>I gave you life
which you lived in my debt!</i>

1308
01:20:48,386 --> 01:20:50,846
<i>Now I'm the one drowning
Tumbling down</i>

1309
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:53,056
<i>Trying to escape what I cannot forget</i>

1310
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:55,518
<i>I have a brother no longer</i>

1311
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,144
<i>It's over and done</i>

1312
01:20:57,645 --> 01:21:00,981
<i>Now all I have is this shame
and this rage that I can't...</i>

1313
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:03,734
<i>Out...</i>

1314
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:32,220
<i>...run</i>

1315
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:53,241
<i>Deceit is a tool of a great king.</i>

1316
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:15,430
There wasn't much to eat on this mountain...

1317
01:22:15,723 --> 01:22:17,099
until now.

1318
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:21,604
Tell me, how did you cover your tracks
in the snow?

1319
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,230
A bird helped us.

1320
01:22:23,396 --> 01:22:26,149
Lions getting help from a bird?

1321
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:29,027
Just as I will help you.

1322
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:30,779
You will help us?

1323
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:33,782
You think we need help from a wounded coward?

1324
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:37,327
I may hold the blood of a king...

1325
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:43,375
but it was Mufasa who killed your son.

1326
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:45,961
It was Mufasa...

1327
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:48,046
who trapped you up here...

1328
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:51,091
outsmarted you at every turn.

1329
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:55,303
Now I will lead you to him and to <i>Milele.</i>

1330
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:57,515
<i>Milele</i>!

1331
01:22:57,681 --> 01:23:02,269
<i>Milele</i> is nothing but a dream,
a vision sold to cubs.

1332
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:05,355
Well, tell that to the monkey.

1333
01:23:05,523 --> 01:23:07,107
He leads them to it.

1334
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:08,692
Look at you.

1335
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:12,070
A pack of starving wolves...

1336
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:14,364
clinging to the side of a mountain.

1337
01:23:14,532 --> 01:23:16,158
No tracks to follow.

1338
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:20,871
Only one chance at revenge.

1339
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:23,040
Me!

1340
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:25,834
Revenge...

1341
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,880
What about your father?

1342
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,507
Because of Mufasa...

1343
01:23:33,216 --> 01:23:34,927
I have no father.

1344
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:37,805
He did this.

1345
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,308
Yes.

1346
01:23:41,474 --> 01:23:43,101
You lost a father...

1347
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:45,604
and I, a son.

1348
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:48,691
Taka, will you join us?

1349
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:53,445
Together, we can both have our revenge.

1350
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:57,991
It will be my pleasure...

1351
01:24:00,327 --> 01:24:01,411
King.

1352
01:24:25,603 --> 01:24:26,604
Taka!

1353
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:29,272
Taka, where have you been?

1354
01:24:30,357 --> 01:24:31,358
Hunting.

1355
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:33,235
I couldn't find anything...

1356
01:24:33,694 --> 01:24:35,528
but I was never as good as you.

1357
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:37,740
Or my mother.

1358
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:42,285
- There's something I need to tell you.
- No.

1359
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:45,163
There's something I need to tell you.

1360
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:47,457
I need to thank you.

1361
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:50,543
You kept your word to Eshe and Obasi.

1362
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:52,796
- Taka...
- You saved me, Mufasa.

1363
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:54,632
And I...

1364
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:59,970
will never forget what you've done,
my brother.

1365
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:07,227
Guys! I have found a way down
just beyond those near peaks.

1366
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:10,105
Was it something I said?

1367
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:21,950
Hey, Rafiki?

1368
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,827
Yes.

1369
01:25:23,994 --> 01:25:26,496
We are nearing destiny, Mufasa.

1370
01:25:26,664 --> 01:25:29,374
And so, the earth must shake.

1371
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:52,522
Okay, now I am 100 million percent sure
who Taka is.

1372
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:53,648
Just be honest. Is it me?

1373
01:25:53,816 --> 01:25:56,276
In case you missed it,
we're not featured in this.

1374
01:25:56,443 --> 01:25:57,903
I think the civet has more screen time.

1375
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:01,031
- Hey, maybe they'll put us in the play.
- No, no, please don't mention the play again.

1376
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:02,282
I went to see it.

1377
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:03,909
I'm nothing but a giant sock puppet.

1378
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:05,368
You went to see it?
You didn't bring me?

1379
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:08,413
Rafiki, Mufasa and Sarabi are in love?

1380
01:26:09,372 --> 01:26:10,373
Love?

1381
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:13,711
That sounds gross and not something like
I constantly think about and really want.

1382
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:15,420
What is Taka gonna do to them?

1383
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:18,841
Little one, Taka's heart was broken.

1384
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:21,885
And now his trap was set.

1385
01:26:37,735 --> 01:26:39,737
Mufasa. Do you see?

1386
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:41,654
I don't believe it.

1387
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:43,907
The other side of the light.

1388
01:26:44,574 --> 01:26:45,575
Home.

1389
01:26:46,409 --> 01:26:48,245
<i>Milele.</i>

1390
01:27:38,796 --> 01:27:39,797
I can't believe it.

1391
01:27:40,713 --> 01:27:44,217
We found it. We found <i>Milele.</i>

1392
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,385
Yes.

1393
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:50,682
You found it, brother.
You always do.

1394
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:31,598
Rafiki.

1395
01:28:33,516 --> 01:28:36,269
This is the tree from your visions.

1396
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:40,690
I have seen this tree many times...

1397
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:44,152
and, in each vision,
there was always a brother...

1398
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:46,279
standing right here.

1399
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:47,990
But there's no one here, Rafiki...

1400
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:50,951
and you came here to find your twin.

1401
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:54,037
He was taken from me long ago.

1402
01:28:54,204 --> 01:28:57,207
What I saw in my dreams was a brother.

1403
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:59,417
Standing right here.

1404
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:02,295
A friend, family.

1405
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:04,172
What I saw was you.

1406
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:05,840
The unseeable.

1407
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:08,468
I saw Mufasa.

1408
01:29:08,635 --> 01:29:09,636
Me?

1409
01:29:09,802 --> 01:29:11,638
Yes, you.

1410
01:29:11,804 --> 01:29:13,390
My brother.

1411
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:20,522
Mufasa.

1412
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:22,107
How do you know who I am?

1413
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:26,069
We know the Outsiders are hunting you,
and we fear you'll bring danger.

1414
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:28,238
No. No. We covered our tracks.

1415
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:30,615
I promise you <i>Milele</i> is a safe place...

1416
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:33,410
and I would never do anything
to jeopardize that.

1417
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:39,374
Do not run.

1418
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:41,584
You have nothing to fear.

1419
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:43,545
We are not here for you.

1420
01:29:44,004 --> 01:29:47,090
We have come for Mufasa.

1421
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:49,551
Oh, no, no. How did they get here?

1422
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:52,804
Do not let him divide us.

1423
01:29:58,268 --> 01:30:01,396
It's no use, Mufasa.
The Circle...

1424
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:05,233
The Circle is broken.

1425
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:06,443
No!

1426
01:30:06,609 --> 01:30:08,070
Mufasa, what are you doing?

1427
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:11,573
I'm going to fight, and I'm going
to show them that they can fight, too.

1428
01:30:12,157 --> 01:30:15,160
Rafiki, when you hear my signal,
help me call them together.

1429
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:16,619
Yes, my brother.

1430
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:20,457
There are other lions here.

1431
01:30:20,623 --> 01:30:21,749
Find them.

1432
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:24,002
With pleasure, Your Majesty.

1433
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,089
Mufasa, you're not alone.

1434
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,716
It's my turn to go ask questions first.

1435
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:46,191
This is where the hunt ends, Mufasa.

1436
01:30:47,985 --> 01:30:49,569
Thanks to your brother.

1437
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:52,114
He left a trail of scars for us to follow.

1438
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,324
He made a deal to save himself.

1439
01:30:54,491 --> 01:30:57,244
- Gave us this kingdom.
- Tell me he's lying.

1440
01:30:57,410 --> 01:30:58,953
Asked us to kill the stray.

1441
01:30:59,121 --> 01:31:00,288
Taka, please!

1442
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:02,499
I'm the son of a king.

1443
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:05,085
But Sarabi chose you.

1444
01:31:05,252 --> 01:31:06,628
Just like Mother.

1445
01:31:06,794 --> 01:31:09,047
Just like my own father.

1446
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:12,425
I saved you and you betrayed me!

1447
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:14,052
What have you done?

1448
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:15,887
I'm your brother, fight with me!

1449
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:18,681
You stole my destiny.

1450
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:20,475
Now this is yours.

1451
01:31:22,269 --> 01:31:24,146
He's one of us now.

1452
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:26,481
My son's name...

1453
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:28,775
was Shaju.

1454
01:31:29,776 --> 01:31:31,319
Shaju!

1455
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:33,905
All of this should have been his.

1456
01:31:34,072 --> 01:31:38,576
And now I will rule it without mercy.

1457
01:31:45,042 --> 01:31:47,335
This one is mine.

1458
01:32:33,298 --> 01:32:36,426
Please. We can't wage this battle alone.

1459
01:32:36,593 --> 01:32:37,844
There's nothing we can do.

1460
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:40,180
They've chased us
from our pride lands before.

1461
01:32:40,347 --> 01:32:42,265
- They're too strong.
- Fight with us.

1462
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:44,934
Fight for your young.
For your future.

1463
01:32:45,102 --> 01:32:47,729
What future?
They've taken all we have.

1464
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:49,939
And they will always take more.

1465
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:17,717
I am Mufasa, a stray with no pride...

1466
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:19,719
and yet I stand before you.

1467
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:20,928
Head unbowed.

1468
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:23,306
I know you're afraid, but trust me.

1469
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:27,477
Nothing will change
if we remain isolated to our own tribes...

1470
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:30,272
without concern for the fate of others.

1471
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:32,232
But why should we stand with you?

1472
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:34,151
This is your fight.

1473
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:37,237
Today, they are here for us lions,
but I assure you...

1474
01:33:37,404 --> 01:33:40,323
as you let them walk among you
in search of us now...

1475
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:43,201
they are plotting to come for you tomorrow.

1476
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:46,413
One lion's hope cannot change
the fate of <i>Milele.</i>

1477
01:33:46,579 --> 01:33:50,542
There is no lion as large as an elephant,
as strong as an oxen...

1478
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:53,170
fast as a cheetah or tall as a giraffe...

1479
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:55,755
who can soar and scout as wide and far...

1480
01:33:55,922 --> 01:33:57,840
as the cranes and hawks in the sky.

1481
01:33:58,049 --> 01:34:00,051
So, can't you see...

1482
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:03,054
Every being has a place
in the Circle of Life.

1483
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:05,014
My breath is your breath.

1484
01:34:05,182 --> 01:34:07,141
Your fight is my fight.

1485
01:34:07,309 --> 01:34:10,687
I will not bend to evil,
and neither should you.

1486
01:34:20,197 --> 01:34:21,864
Mufasa is right.

1487
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:23,700
<i>Milele</i> is home.

1488
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:27,995
We must stand with Mufasa!

1489
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:34,961
Together we shall stand strong for <i>Milele!</i>

1490
01:34:42,344 --> 01:34:44,512
Here comes the lion!

1491
01:34:53,062 --> 01:34:55,232
From this moment on...

1492
01:34:55,398 --> 01:35:00,027
everything the light touches belongs to me.

1493
01:35:00,278 --> 01:35:01,654
You'll have to take it.

1494
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:28,598
Bye-bye.

1495
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:38,232
You've messed with the wrong hornbill!

1496
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:42,612
Lunch is served.

1497
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:46,449
Stand down! I am highly trained
and occasionally a...

1498
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:50,870
This is so embarrassing.

1499
01:35:52,246 --> 01:35:55,249
I do have wings, you know.

1500
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:14,060
Taka!

1501
01:36:15,144 --> 01:36:17,980
Taka, please. Please!

1502
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:24,362
Mufasa.

1503
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:26,739
Mufasa.

1504
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:24,547
You dare...

1505
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:27,634
to challenge me?

1506
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:31,012
You took my son.

1507
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:33,640
<i>My future.</i>

1508
01:37:34,223 --> 01:37:38,144
<i>Taka, your moment of courage will come.</i>

1509
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:44,692
Blood for blood.

1510
01:37:53,034 --> 01:37:55,286
Please. Don't kill him.

1511
01:37:55,453 --> 01:37:57,121
I didn't kill him.

1512
01:37:57,288 --> 01:37:58,623
You did.

1513
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:29,361
They're coming.

1514
01:38:31,948 --> 01:38:34,075
The last lions.

1515
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:35,952
Time for their extinction...

1516
01:38:36,118 --> 01:38:38,370
and we'll start with the youngest.

1517
01:38:48,339 --> 01:38:51,008
The earth will shake.

1518
01:38:54,637 --> 01:38:56,473
Attack!

1519
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:31,591
Mufasa.

1520
01:40:03,623 --> 01:40:05,249
<i>Close your eyes...</i>

1521
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:07,627
<i>and tell me what you hear.</i>

1522
01:40:07,794 --> 01:40:09,796
<i>What you feel.</i>

1523
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:35,214
Mufasa!

1524
01:42:14,461 --> 01:42:16,463
He defeated the Outsiders.

1525
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:19,341
- The king of <i>Milele!</i>
- The king of <i>Milele!</i>

1526
01:42:23,512 --> 01:42:25,765
Is that him? Our king?

1527
01:42:32,438 --> 01:42:33,522
Your Highness.

1528
01:42:35,024 --> 01:42:37,193
- The King of <i>Milele.</i>
- The King of <i>Milele.</i>

1529
01:42:37,985 --> 01:42:39,278
The King of <i>Milele.</i>

1530
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,493
- My king.
- Your Highness.

1531
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:48,287
- Your Majesty.
- My king.

1532
01:42:48,454 --> 01:42:49,621
Defeated Kiros!

1533
01:42:53,042 --> 01:42:55,002
- My king.
- King?

1534
01:42:55,169 --> 01:42:57,880
No, no, I'm not king.

1535
01:42:58,047 --> 01:42:59,173
Raise your heads.

1536
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:01,968
No. I'm just... No, no!
No more kings.

1537
01:43:02,134 --> 01:43:04,470
We are all one. Please.

1538
01:43:04,636 --> 01:43:06,764
Please. Raise your heads.

1539
01:43:07,014 --> 01:43:08,975
But, Mufasa...

1540
01:43:09,141 --> 01:43:11,102
you have brought them together.

1541
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:15,647
You helped them see in themselves
what they considered unseeable.

1542
01:43:16,315 --> 01:43:18,776
Nothing is more kingly.

1543
01:43:18,985 --> 01:43:21,028
No, Rafiki.

1544
01:43:21,195 --> 01:43:24,281
I'm not king.
I'm not royal blood.

1545
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:26,242
Don't you see, my brother?

1546
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:29,161
It is not what you were...

1547
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:32,706
it is what you have become.

1548
01:43:34,416 --> 01:43:37,211
The King of <i>Milele.</i>

1549
01:43:44,176 --> 01:43:45,552
My brother...

1550
01:43:46,012 --> 01:43:48,973
something beautiful awaits you.

1551
01:44:01,443 --> 01:44:02,653
Is this real?

1552
01:44:06,115 --> 01:44:07,324
But it can't be.

1553
01:44:10,036 --> 01:44:11,453
It can't be.

1554
01:44:33,642 --> 01:44:34,852
Mufasa.

1555
01:44:35,602 --> 01:44:37,271
But how can it be?

1556
01:44:37,729 --> 01:44:41,150
I had a son named Mufasa.

1557
01:44:41,358 --> 01:44:44,153
Taken from me by a great flood.

1558
01:44:44,653 --> 01:44:45,654
Mother?

1559
01:44:47,364 --> 01:44:49,491
I never stopped hoping.

1560
01:44:49,658 --> 01:44:51,410
Believing.

1561
01:44:51,577 --> 01:44:52,912
My son.

1562
01:44:55,998 --> 01:44:57,791
I've dreamt of this moment.

1563
01:45:00,544 --> 01:45:02,254
And now it's come true.

1564
01:45:02,463 --> 01:45:04,215
Oh, Mufasa.

1565
01:45:09,345 --> 01:45:10,637
But Father?

1566
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:13,765
Where's Father?

1567
01:45:20,356 --> 01:45:22,316
He lives in you now.

1568
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:26,195
He lives in you.

1569
01:45:32,826 --> 01:45:35,204
I always dreamed we'd be together again.

1570
01:45:36,455 --> 01:45:40,417
And I knew it would be in <i>Milele.</i>

1571
01:45:42,461 --> 01:45:43,587
My son.

1572
01:45:44,755 --> 01:45:45,965
Mufasa.

1573
01:45:52,930 --> 01:45:56,058
Mufasa, please forgive me.

1574
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:59,645
You must banish him, Sire.

1575
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,357
As long as I am king...

1576
01:46:03,524 --> 01:46:05,985
my brother will have a place here.

1577
01:46:07,736 --> 01:46:10,239
Brother, I am so...

1578
01:46:10,406 --> 01:46:12,241
But I won't ever...

1579
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:14,535
say your name again.

1580
01:46:15,912 --> 01:46:17,163
I can't.

1581
01:46:18,414 --> 01:46:19,623
I won't.

1582
01:46:20,457 --> 01:46:22,293
Then call me Scar.

1583
01:46:22,919 --> 01:46:26,172
So I will never forget what I have done.

1584
01:46:26,964 --> 01:46:28,257
Scar.

1585
01:46:29,258 --> 01:46:30,968
Your Majesty.

1586
01:46:40,477 --> 01:46:41,938
Welcome home.

1587
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:50,696
Your Majesty.

1588
01:46:58,662 --> 01:47:00,247
So, Mufasa...

1589
01:47:00,414 --> 01:47:05,586
I see your family has been awaiting you
in <i>Milele</i> after all.

1590
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:08,339
Yes, Rafiki.

1591
01:47:09,631 --> 01:47:10,967
Yes, they were.

1592
01:47:17,974 --> 01:47:20,851
It is your time, Mufasa.

1593
01:47:22,019 --> 01:47:24,438
Rafiki, I wish I could see him.

1594
01:47:24,896 --> 01:47:26,898
I wish I could meet my grandfather.

1595
01:47:27,066 --> 01:47:29,610
As Mufasa once told your father...

1596
01:47:29,776 --> 01:47:31,862
look into the heavens, Kiara.

1597
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:35,616
The great kings of the past
will always be there...

1598
01:47:36,408 --> 01:47:37,659
waiting for you.

1599
01:49:25,642 --> 01:49:29,230
I don't want him to go, Rafiki.
I don't want it to end.

1600
01:49:29,813 --> 01:49:31,732
Don't you see, Kiara?

1601
01:49:32,108 --> 01:49:34,818
Mufasa lives in you.

1602
01:49:35,694 --> 01:49:38,071
He lives in you.

1603
01:49:41,283 --> 01:49:42,243
Dad!

1604
01:49:43,619 --> 01:49:45,829
- Rafiki.
- It was unbelievable.

1605
01:49:45,996 --> 01:49:47,873
- It was perfect.
- You could not improve on it.

1606
01:49:48,039 --> 01:49:49,583
That said, I do have notes.

1607
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:52,211
Some suggestions.
Take 'em or leave 'em. But take 'em.

1608
01:49:53,754 --> 01:49:55,464
- Dad!
- Kiara!

1609
01:49:58,425 --> 01:49:59,760
Kiara.

1610
01:49:59,926 --> 01:50:00,927
Dad.

1611
01:50:01,345 --> 01:50:02,763
Where's Mom?

1612
01:50:02,929 --> 01:50:05,557
Well, love, there's something
you need to know.

1613
01:50:05,724 --> 01:50:07,934
What? Did something happen to Mom?

1614
01:50:08,101 --> 01:50:10,396
Baby, I'm right here, and I'm fine.

1615
01:50:10,604 --> 01:50:12,189
Where were you?

1616
01:50:12,356 --> 01:50:13,357
Kiara...

1617
01:50:13,524 --> 01:50:15,526
this is your new brother.

1618
01:50:15,692 --> 01:50:16,777
Brother?

1619
01:50:16,943 --> 01:50:18,195
I have a brother?

1620
01:50:19,155 --> 01:50:22,574
Hi there. I'm Kiara.
I will take care of you.

1621
01:50:23,116 --> 01:50:24,535
Forever.

1622
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:26,912
Little one...

1623
01:50:27,078 --> 01:50:28,830
let me tell you a story.

1624
01:50:29,331 --> 01:50:32,083
A story of a great king.
