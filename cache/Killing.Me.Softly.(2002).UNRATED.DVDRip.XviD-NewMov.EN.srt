1
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,490
You know what happens
at that height?

2
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,060
The brain dies
from lack of oxygen...

3
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,790
cell by cell.

4
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,900
It just shuts down...

5
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,460
and the body goes with it.

6
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,140
I can't stop thinking about
what it must have been like.

7
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,990
Why don't you start
at the beginning?

8
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,980
It's always the easiest.

9
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,650
OK, I'll start
at the beginning.

10
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,820
I grew up on the plains
in Indiana.

11
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,420
I was a flatlander,
through and through.

12
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,530
To be honest...

13
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,760
I really didn't have
much to leave behind.

14
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,760
Virtually no family
and very few friends.

15
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,770
Anyway, it was January.

16
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,510
I'd already been in London
a year and a half.

17
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,880
For the first six months,
I'd been incredibly lonely.

18
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,370
Then I met Jake.

19
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,950
What I loved the most...

20
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,850
was how comfortable
we were with each other.

21
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,690
I felt safe.

22
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,770
OK, let's go.

23
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,250
I design CD-roms
and websites...

24
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,450
for corporate clients.

25
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,950
That must pay well.

26
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,290
It sounds fancier
than it is.

27
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,020
Jake was an engineer.

28
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,520
Tunnels and bridges,
that sort of thing.

29
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,930
He kept his tube tickets...

30
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,190
in a wallet he got
when he was twelve.

31
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,360
Same wallet,
same inside pocket.

32
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,030
Alice? Alice?

33
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,260
See you later.

34
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,380
Hey, Alice.

35
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,380
You going in?

36
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,370
Yeah.

37
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,440
I'll see you in a minute.

38
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,080
Reconfigure the training
program manual...

39
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,950
to make it look like
a game on the website.

40
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,640
We tried that with
the appliance kings.

41
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,660
Yes, but this isn't
about washing machines.

42
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,950
Now we're training
a worldwide sales force.

43
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,700
You're the new media pioneers.

44
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,330
Think of something.

45
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,000
Alice, you still have
the old template, don't you?

46
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,970
Are you with us, Alice?

47
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,760
I'm going out
to get my hair trimmed.

48
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,950
I'll be back after lunch.

49
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,410
Oh, shoot!

50
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,040
And you got in?

51
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,440
Yeah...

52
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,740
I got in.

53
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,760
What's your name?

54
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,020
Alice.

55
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,160
Alice.

56
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,290
Don't turn away.

57
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,340
Come here tomorrow.

58
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,710
I have to work.

59
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,150
Then come back tonight.

60
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,490
I can't.

61
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,370
Whenever you want, Alice.

62
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,600
You decide, and I'll be here.

63
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,280
I couldn't believe
what had happened that day.

64
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,580
I knew it shouldn't
happen again.

65
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,320
I wanted everything
back the way it was.

66
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,600
What do you want me to do?

67
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,740
Nothing, just keep doing
what you're doing.

68
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,930
That was when
I found out his name...

69
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,200
Adam Tallis...

70
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,030
and that he climbed mountains.

71
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,540
He caused quite a stir
here yesterday.

72
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,980
He saved
six people up there...

73
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,380
with no oxygen.

74
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,300
You stop me
whenever you want.

75
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,000
Please don't stop.

76
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,970
I bought your book today.

77
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,860
It isn't my book.

78
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,550
I'm just in it.

79
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,980
It looks good.

80
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,700
People died, Alice.

81
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,770
Something went very wrong.

82
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,020
There was a woman
named Francoise Collette.

83
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,160
I lost the whole group.

84
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,040
I still don't understand
what happened.

85
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,170
There was no room for error.

86
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,540
Everything had been checked.

87
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,250
I was in love with her.

88
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,710
Do you know what it's like
over 20,000 feet?

89
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,290
It's like this.

90
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,390
Without air,
the brain cells die.

91
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,510
It shuts down.

92
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,640
and then the rest
of the body follows.

93
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,320
It's been two years...

94
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,650
and it doesn't go away.

95
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,390
I live with someone.

96
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,170
But you're here.

97
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,380
I have to go.

98
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,620
Don't put them on.

99
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,110
Hi. Where are you?

100
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,380
I'm running some errands.

101
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,020
Do you think you could
pick up my watch...

102
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,020
on the way home?

103
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,020
I'm running behind schedule.

104
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,020
I'm never going to make it.

105
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,010
Of course I can.

106
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,830
I missed you today, Alice.

107
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,900
Miss you.

108
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,900
I love you.

109
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,950
Love you.

110
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,110
Knock it! Not nice.

111
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,750
And give it!

112
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,780
Go in!

113
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,210
A card? Ref,
that's a bit harsh.

114
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,420
Yeah. Sorry. I'm just...

115
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,080
There's nobody there!

116
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,560
I have to leave you.

117
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,560
You what?

118
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,390
I can't go on like this.
I'm sorry.

119
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,090
I have to leave.

120
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,030
You have to leave me?

121
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,350
We're together.

122
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,720
We're perfect together.

123
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,490
I want to marry you.

124
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,230
I met somebody.

125
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,780
Who did you meet?

126
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,040
You don't know him.

127
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,950
I'm sorry.

128
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,150
When did you meet him?

129
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,420
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

130
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,320
It's not the point--

131
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,020
It's very much the point!

132
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,390
We go to the market
together every Sunday!

133
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,230
I buy your fucking
tube tickets for you!

134
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,660
Jesus!

135
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,770
Where you going?

136
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,770
You were looking for Adam.

137
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,040
He's not here
at the moment...

138
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,970
but it's cold out there.
Come in.

139
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,480
Please, come in.

140
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,320
I've been climbing in Chile.

141
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,690
Adam always takes
his pictures down...

142
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,390
or makes sure his back
is turned to them.

143
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,290
Oh, please, sit down.

144
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,610
For me, pictures
tell me who I am...

145
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,010
but for Adam,
they steal his soul.

146
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,180
Want some?

147
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,220
No, thank you.

148
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,240
No, it's quite good.

149
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,690
I'm his sister.

150
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,190
You're his sister?

151
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,390
Yep. I'm Deborah.

152
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:15,000
We climb together a lot.

153
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,930
He was having some work
done on his place...

154
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,800
so he stayed here
while I was gone.

155
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
This...

156
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,470
is Mr. Know-it-all.

157
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,940
It's his name.

158
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,250
This is Francoise, right?

159
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,720
That's the real reason...

160
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,220
my brother takes
the pictures down...

161
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,480
because it's...

162
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,490
too hard for him to see her.

163
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,400
My brother's a brave guy,
but sometimes...

164
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,300
he's afraid of remembering.

165
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,840
What he forgets...

166
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,380
is that he's not
the only one responsible.

167
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,210
I was up there, too.

168
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,940
She was
my best friend, Alice.

169
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,620
Yes, I know your name.

170
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,730
You're very beautiful.

171
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:33,360
I can see why he'd
fall so hard for you.

172
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,950
The thing about my brother...

173
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,720
is you're either
with him or you're not.

174
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,820
And once you've made
the jump and you're with him...

175
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,130
that's it...

176
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,620
there's no discussion.

177
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,500
Can I have his address?

178
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,530
Yes, of course.

179
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,440
Thank you.

180
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,420
I left him.

181
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,460
You're hurting me.

182
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,000
Morning.

183
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,380
Alice, this is Joanna.
Joanna, Alice.

184
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,230
Joanna Noble
from "The Guardian."

185
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,290
I'm interviewing Adam

186
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,060
about his Himalayan
clean-up project.

187
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,260
Nice to meet you.

188
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,590
Where can I find a shirt?

189
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,340
Your phone?

190
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,470
Would you get that for me?

191
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,080
No one there.

192
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,390
In some respects,
it's just become...

193
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,260
a playground for
the rich and inexperienced.

194
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,980
Thank you.

195
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,570
I have to go to work.

196
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,000
Will you think
about me today?

197
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,240
Yes.
What are you doing today?

198
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,230
Thinking about you.

199
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,980
Do you want to learn
how to climb?

200
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,640
Sure.

201
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,310
Come and see me after work.

202
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,060
That's good.

203
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,060
He's not as strong
as he was last week.

204
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,340
It's lovely to see you.

205
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,650
I see you've got a harness.

206
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,150
Do you want to put it on?

207
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:21,120
Just put your feet
in there...

208
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,110
and pull it up
like a pair of trousers.

209
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,720
That's great.

210
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,670
That's right, double-back in.

211
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:37,800
There we go.

212
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,810
It suits you.

213
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,790
Thank you.

214
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,280
It's OK. I'm helping her.

215
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,550
How are you?

216
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,750
OK, fine.

217
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,020
I'm sorry.

218
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,150
Let me check your harness.

219
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,420
Seems to be good.

220
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,330
She's my sister,
but she drives me mad.

221
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,560
I swear it's chemical.

222
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,070
You ready?

223
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,540
I don't know. Maybe.

224
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,730
Come on.

225
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,550
Well, finally, Alice.

226
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:23,520
The flatlander captured
the mountain boy.

227
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,790
Alice, meet Klaus.
Klaus, Alice.

228
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,120
I liked your book.

229
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,580
Well, thank you.

230
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,390
Well, nice to meet you.

231
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:42,270
This looks hard.

232
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,670
It's all in the mind.

233
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,360
I mean, my taste in clothes
has completely changed.

234
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,560
Really?

235
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,720
I bought this practically
transparent pink T-shirt.

236
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,930
And I won't even tell you
about the lingerie.

237
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,770
No. Probably best not
to mention the lingerie.

238
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:18,540
I'm still in the big
white cotton panties.

239
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,030
I'm sorry.
I'm a little manic.

240
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,270
Have you seen Jake?

241
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,750
Of course I have.

242
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,580
He's been my friend
for 15 years.

243
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
How is he?

244
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
What can I say?

245
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,390
He's smoking like a fiend...

246
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,480
and he's completely fucked up.

247
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,590
It's not like there's
no reason, is there?

248
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,690
Sorry.

249
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,830
I think that you're
destroying both of your lives.

250
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,670
I'm sorry.

251
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:00,080
You had somebody
who loved you.

252
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,550
You loved each other...

253
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:05,520
and you let him go
for good sex.

254
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,090
Love isn't just
a good fuck, you know?

255
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,090
This is more.

256
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,520
More what?

257
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
More everything.

258
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,790
When I'm with him,
everything is more.

259
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,790
Oh, God, Alice.

260
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,000
You could write
greetings cards.

261
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,430
You really bloody could.

262
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,160
Sorry.

263
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,030
Right.

264
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,610
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

265
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,880
I could do with some retail
therapy myself, I think.

266
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,050
I can't,
but come with me.

267
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,520
I'm gonna
see Adam at 3:00.

268
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,510
You can meet him.

269
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,590
And there's this
really amazing store...

270
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,060
and I haven't bought it
yet, but I will...

271
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,800
It's OK. She's fine.

272
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,030
Call the police.

273
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,710
Adam! Stop!

274
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,560
When I saw him...

275
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,860
oh, Jesus.

276
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,570
That'll never happen again.

277
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,660
I won't let it.

278
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,440
Are you OK?

279
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,740
Yeah.

280
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,380
I'll always be here, Alice.

281
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,880
Yeah.

282
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,280
I'll protect you.

283
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
Say you believe me.

284
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,440
I believe you.

285
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,310
Marry me.

286
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,360
The sooner the better.

287
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,570
Tomorrow.

288
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,430
The day after,
as soon as possible.

289
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,530
-Marry me!
-Yes!

290
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,020
Sir, can we ask you
some questions, please?

291
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,080
"Use your head, Alice.

292
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,210
"What do you really know
about him?"

293
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,460
Hey, you ready?

294
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,680
Look at this.

295
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,300
Someone's trying to scare you.

296
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,300
There's been
a call this morning.

297
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,300
There was someone there...

298
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,460
but they didn't say anything.

299
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,200
Makes me sick.

300
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,470
If anything else
happens like this again...

301
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:49,070
make sure you tell me, OK?

302
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,310
You'll be fine.

303
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,880
Do you, Alice...

304
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,580
promise to love
and cherish Adam...

305
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,610
for as long
as you both shall live?

306
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,350
I do.

307
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:33,150
And do you, Adam, promise
to love and cherish Alice...

308
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,490
for as long
as you both shall live?

309
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,960
I do.

310
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,160
May the Lord
bless this union...

311
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,820
and secure it from all harm.

312
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,250
How do you know the priest?

313
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,990
This is my family church.

314
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:11,360
You have a family church?

315
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,160
Wow, I have a mother
who doesn't talk to me...

316
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,490
and a dad I've never met.

317
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,860
It doesn't matter.

318
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,630
My life began
when we first saw each other.

319
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,800
Come on.
I need you to see something.

320
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,790
What?

321
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,690
No, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

322
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,090
Now, I want you
to see this...

323
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,150
through my eyes
when I was six.

324
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,060
Look. Like this.

325
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,100
You know the story that
we're broken into two pieces?

326
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,440
And we spend our lives

327
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,240
searching for
our other half.

328
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,150
You're it.

329
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,880
OK, here we are.

330
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,030
We're getting dressed here?

331
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,260
Yep. Here.

332
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:50,820
No! No, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

333
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,550
I need to remember you
like this.

334
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,240
Come on. I don't want you
to freeze to death.

335
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,970
Come on.

336
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,580
This is the only
way station...

337
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,910
for hikers
in the whole area.

338
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,970
The church has kept supplies
up here for years.

339
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,330
You went hiking
on your wedding day?

340
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:05,320
That's his idea of romance.

341
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,170
I thought a honeymoon
was lying in bed...

342
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,310
with room service.

343
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:17,540
Oh, I'll give you
a honeymoon you won't forget.

344
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,550
I promise.

345
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,530
No, no, sit down.

346
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,280
Choose your rhythm and then
commit to following it.

347
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,820
Count if you have to.

348
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,590
I'm gonna make you strong!

349
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,040
I wanted him to be
proud of me...

350
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,270
so I followed the trail
for hours.

351
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,690
You made it.

352
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,370
What's that?

353
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:56,580
It's an anchor...

354
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,700
to catch a falling body.

355
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:02,900
Catch.

356
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,150
Do you trust me?

357
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,180
Yes.

358
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,230
Don't move.

359
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,840
I gave up all control.

360
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,510
I let him decide
when I could breathe...

361
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:03,310
and when I couldn't.

362
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,210
I loved it.

363
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,060
God, I love you!

364
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:14,250
We returned to London...

365
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,240
and Joanna Noble's
article came out.

366
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,550
I was happier
than I'd ever been.

367
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,840
Excuse me.

368
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:26,950
-There you go.
-Thanks.

369
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:15,070
Hello, Jake?

370
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:19,340
No, it's Sylvie speaking.
Hello, Alice.

371
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,610
Sylvie?

372
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:21,610
I must have dialed wrong.

373
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:22,610
I thought I was
calling Jake.

374
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:23,920
Oh, no, no, that's fine.

375
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,550
I just happened to be
over, actually.

376
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,590
Jake's going to be
back soon, I think.

377
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:32,520
Look, Alice, this is
gonna sound a bit weird...

378
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,190
but I was definitely
going to tell you...

379
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,530
but Jake and I
have actually been...

380
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,060
seeing each other.

381
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,400
You and Jake?

382
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,770
Well, it...
just sort of happened.

383
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,260
Did you move in?

384
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,710
Yeah. Yeah, I did,
uh, sort of.

385
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,610
Oh, Lord.

386
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,820
How cliché is this?

387
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,590
Old friend moves in...

388
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,220
to console jilted boyfriend...

389
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,520
and then these two find
themselves together.

390
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:09,060
You gonna be OK with this?

391
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,000
Yeah, I'm OK.

392
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,630
We're gonna be late!
Hurry up!

393
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,770
Yeah, I gotta go.

394
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,000
We'll talk
about it later, OK?

395
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,850
Here we go.

396
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,560
How you doing?!

397
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,460
Hey, Alice, Alice,
I'm sorry.

398
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,250
Sorry.

399
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:08,340
Excuse me.

400
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,180
How you doing?
It's really nice to see you.

401
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,840
It's Alice Tallis.

402
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,750
My rhyming sister-in-law.

403
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,190
Are you OK?

404
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:22,030
I have a headache and was
looking for some aspirin.

405
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:23,590
Oh, no, give me your hand.

406
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,800
Can you feel that?

407
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,290
Yeah, it really hurts.

408
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:36,560
Close your eyes.

409
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,870
Breathe.

410
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,340
Slowly.

411
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,460
That's good.

412
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:02,330
It's the meridian
that controls the kidney

413
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:04,800
or the brain
or the left big toe.

414
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,640
I forget which.

415
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:12,840
But...it's whatever
works, right?

416
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,080
Thank you.

417
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,210
Close your eyes.

418
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,330
OK, you can open them.

419
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:29,560
Oh, my God.

420
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:33,100
I want to drink to that
beautiful lady in blue.

421
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,160
Where is she?

422
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:43,570
I don't think she's ever
climbed past the third floor...

423
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,170
but she has conquered
our Adam.

424
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:51,680
But what she doesn't know
is that to get Adam...

425
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,550
she also gets us.

426
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:55,450
Hear, hear!

427
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,370
Most of the people
using the program are women...

428
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:09,630
and we try
to sell them a game...

429
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:11,640
but women don't like games.

430
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,640
Women like stories.

431
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,810
Men like games.

432
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,540
Men like to slay the dragon...

433
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:16,640
and get the princess...

434
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,840
but women like to know...

435
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,280
how did the dragon
and the princess...

436
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,070
all get there
in the first place.

437
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,350
A game is
the wrong approach.

438
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:31,680
Sorry.

439
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,060
Excuse me.

440
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,400
Alice Tallis.

441
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,860
This is Joanna Noble.

442
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:39,860
Do you remember me?

443
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,670
Yes, I remember you.

444
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:46,100
I got a weird note
about the article.

445
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,110
I'm not gonna do
anything with it.

446
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:50,440
I mean, I'm certainly not
going to follow it up.

447
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,540
It's probably
stupid of me...

448
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,380
but I somehow felt obliged...

449
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,740
to tell you about it.

450
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,950
Shall I send it to you?

451
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,850
Yeah, you can send it.

452
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,020
Is it private?

453
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,360
I don't want this sitting
in a public "in" basket.

454
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,460
I understand.
You can fax it.

455
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,930
OK, I'll do that.

456
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:10,930
You have the number?

457
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:11,930
Yeah, I got it
from your secretary.

458
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:13,530
OK, thanks for calling.

459
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:14,900
Sorry.
I had to take that.

460
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,700
No problem.

461
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,210
Gave me a chance to think.

462
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,340
We shouldn't be playing games.

463
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,000
It's obvious
women don't like games.

464
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,320
I think this project
needs a new face.

465
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,250
"Dear Joanna Noble,
what you wrote made me sick.

466
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,060
"Your big hero Adam Tallis
raped me.

467
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,520
"Why don't you try
reporting the truth?"

468
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,490
It's out of paper.

469
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:50,740
I've decided
that from now on...

470
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,340
this is Alice's project.

471
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,340
You're the new point man...

472
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,240
I mean, point girl...

473
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,310
woman.

474
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,300
Excellent.

475
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,350
Congratulations, Alice.

476
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:08,580
Thank you.

477
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,560
Open or closed?

478
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,050
Closed.

479
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:28,330
Fuck!

480
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,820
Alice Tallis' office.

481
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,090
Hello, Claudia,
it's Adam.

482
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:42,490
Oh, hi, Adam.

483
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:43,520
Hi. Is Alice there?

484
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,320
No, she's just left,
actually.

485
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,520
Left? Where'd she go?

486
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,650
I think she went
to the doctor's.

487
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:03,540
So, you thought this woman
was sending the notes?

488
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:04,570
Yes.

489
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,300
Yeah?

490
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,200
Hello, I'm Joanna Noble
from "The Guardian."

491
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,370
I called you before.

492
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:30,540
Yeah.

493
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,400
-Are you Michelle Stowe?
-Yeah, I am. Come in.

494
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,940
It was at a birthday party.

495
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,250
I asked him to dance...

496
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,810
and then, I don't know...

497
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,680
we start kissin'.

498
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:50,210
I mean, I was shit-faced.

499
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,980
I came and put my hand
in his shirt...

500
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:56,890
then we went outside.

501
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,630
Guess at the end, I was just
straightening up a bit...

502
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:08,530
'cause I remember wondering...

503
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,110
what the hell I was doing.

504
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,390
Then he pulled me
into the bushes...

505
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:28,790
undid my dress.

506
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,190
It was a zip...

507
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:34,320
in the back.

508
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:42,870
I was so young.

509
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,040
I started to cry.

510
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,540
He put his hand
over my mouth and kept going.

511
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,490
He's strong.

512
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:02,480
There was nothing
I could do.

513
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,190
I tried to fight him.

514
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,240
When he was done,
he shook me...

515
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,970
and said something like...

516
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,740
"It's only sex.

517
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,740
"Just sex."

518
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,080
Then he got up...

519
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,250
and left the party
with his sister.

520
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:40,800
So, you want to write
an article about this, then?

521
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:44,600
I mean, he's not royal
or anything...

522
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,190
but it's close enough.

523
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,770
We can make some money
out of this, Joanna.

524
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,250
It doesn't work that way.

525
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,320
Yeah, it does.
Everybody's always blabbin'...

526
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,950
about who's stickin' it
into who.

527
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:03,650
They make plenty.

528
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,560
You have no proof.

529
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,890
This is a question of
"he said, she said."

530
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:14,370
Jesus, Alice, I can't
believe you did this.

531
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,830
What if she calls
my editor?

532
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:17,940
I could be fired.

533
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,540
Do you think
that nosy wives...

534
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,410
have immunity
from normal behavior?

535
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:22,870
I knew the minute
that I called...

536
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:23,980
that it was a mistake.

537
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,480
Sorry, Alice.

538
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,480
It's OK. I just--

539
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,680
I thought you should know
what I did.

540
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,450
It was really
just innocent curiosity.

541
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:32,420
It's never innocent.

542
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:36,050
Curiosity gets people killed.

543
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:37,660
What would you do
if it was your husband?

544
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,720
I don't have one.

545
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,290
You not only have one...

546
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:42,620
but one who's wild
about you.

547
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,990
You're right.
I have to trust him.

548
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,960
People have stories.

549
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,630
You and I, everyone.

550
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:22,500
But I couldn't tell you
one complete story...

551
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,300
about my husband.

552
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,640
Practically everything
I knew about him...

553
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,770
came from a book
or a newspaper...

554
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:33,480
or shreds of information
dropped by other people.

555
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,750
I couldn't help myself.

556
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:38,110
I needed to know more.

557
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:09,110
"Adele Blanchard."

558
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,390
"It's crazy...

559
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:18,750
"but I want to show
the world my bruises."

560
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:23,290
"What we're doing
is dangerous...

561
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:25,920
"but I still can't help
wanting more."

562
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:36,540
"The only way to end this
is to be brutal.

563
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,840
"We have to stop
what we're doing.

564
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,310
"I've decided to go back
to my husband.

565
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:47,090
"I'm not strong enough to live
on the edge with you anymore.

566
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,390
"I know you won't fall,
but I will.

567
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:51,590
"I'm sure of it.

568
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:53,930
"This tears me apart...

569
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,690
"But I have to go back
to Michael.

570
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:58,830
"I love you.

571
00:58:58,830 --> 00:58:59,920
"Adele."

572
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:07,990
I've been thinking about you.

573
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:16,530
Me, too.

574
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:40,060
I called the office yesterday
looking for you.

575
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,600
Oh, yeah?

576
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,000
Claudia said
you weren't feeling well.

577
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,870
She thought you might be
at the doctor's.

578
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:48,410
I, um...

579
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:50,610
I had an appointment,
but, um...

580
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:51,970
I never got out
of my meeting.

581
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,260
Where was the meeting?

582
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:10,350
At the, um, client's hotel.

583
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:18,800
Which hotel?

584
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,100
The Hilton.

585
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,710
I'm sorry for being nosy.

586
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,440
I just like to picture
what you do during the day.

587
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,170
Where'd you get this?

588
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:02,740
Deborah gave it to me.

589
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,810
She has good taste.

590
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,470
I got a call about, um...

591
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:24,700
a weird call
about the article.

592
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:28,810
There was this woman
named Michelle Stowe.

593
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:30,360
She sent a fax.

594
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:34,650
Didn't happen, Alice.

595
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:35,670
I never raped her.

596
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,820
I shouldn't have...

597
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:42,890
I've known her
since we were kids.

598
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:45,980
I think she saw me
as a way out.

599
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:50,230
If you met her,
you'd understand.

600
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:52,350
I'm not surprised
she contacted you.

601
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,090
I'm just sorry
you had to hear all that.

602
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:10,850
Good morning.

603
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:11,850
Hi there.
Are you ready?

604
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:13,750
I'll just get my jacket.

605
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,590
I'm sorry to barge in
like that...

606
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:23,390
but your husband refuses
to understand the fact...

607
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:25,230
that sponsors need talk shows...

608
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:28,360
and he would only show up
if I drove.

609
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:34,940
Why didn't you tell me...

610
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,610
you were gonna be
on a talk show?

611
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:38,400
It's just
a stupid jazz show.

612
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,500
Directory inquiries.

613
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:46,040
Yes. Adele Blanchard.

614
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,300
Which city, please?

615
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,370
It's London.

616
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:50,110
Do you have a listing
for Adele Blanchard...

617
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:51,680
on Marchmont Road?

618
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:52,660
One moment.

619
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:08,060
This train is about to depart.

620
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:09,890
Please mind the doors.

621
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:39,190
I'm looking
for Adele Blanchard.

622
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:42,030
I'm her mother.

623
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:43,390
Is she home?

624
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,630
You must be one
of her American friends.

625
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:51,120
We tried to contact everyone.

626
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:58,000
She's been missing
for eight months.

627
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:00,950
Missing?

628
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,440
What did you say
your name was?

629
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,250
Joanna.

630
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:09,290
She never tried
to contact her husband?

631
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:10,690
Not even a letter
to an old boyfriend...

632
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:12,090
or something?

633
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:14,960
Eight months
and not a word.

634
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,730
And this is from a daughter...

635
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:20,890
who manages to e-mail
her mother from Nepal.

636
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:30,980
Joanna, promise me you'll never
think the worst about Adele.

637
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,510
It helps a little...

638
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:35,840
if one tries to be positive.

639
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:48,530
She was so happy that day.

640
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:50,430
No jitters, nothing.

641
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,730
Do you know him?

642
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:59,340
Adam Tallis.

643
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:02,640
She climbed all over
the world with him.

644
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,980
My son-in-law Michael...

645
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,940
is a trader in Milan.

646
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,950
At first, he never
stood in her way...

647
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:12,180
when it came to climbing.

648
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,390
Then after two years,
he got fed up.

649
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:19,960
It was either climbing
or the marriage.

650
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,580
She chose the marriage.

651
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:27,090
The day before she was
supposed to go back to Milan...

652
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,800
she went out...

653
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,860
and never came back.

654
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:38,510
I found that
in her bags.

655
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:41,380
It's probably the last
picture taken of her.

656
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:49,150
Today I've had two signs
that Adele is close by.

657
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:51,210
You arrived,
and Adam called.

658
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:01,630
He wanted to know
if there was anything new...

659
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:03,290
in the investigation.

660
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,900
Would you like
to stay for dinner?

661
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:09,110
No, thank you.
I just--I have to get home.

662
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:10,700
It's really late.

663
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,280
I'm disappointed.

664
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,150
He should be here around 5:00.

665
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:22,480
You and Adam
would love each other.

666
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,490
Sit, sit.

667
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:28,220
I'll get it.

668
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,340
Is it all right if
I set it up for next week?

669
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:43,910
I haven't managed
to get to the bank yet.

670
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:46,310
Yes, of course.

671
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:48,680
Mrs. Blanchard.

672
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,710
I'm sorry, I just--
I have to get back.

673
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:52,080
I don't want
to be late.

674
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,250
I was hoping
you would stay a little.

675
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:54,770
I'm sorry.

676
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:15,310
This train is about to depart.

677
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:17,300
Please mind the doors.

678
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:49,290
What are you doing?!

679
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:51,620
What am I doing?
I'm making you mine.

680
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:02,300
Sometimes I feel
like I don't know you.

681
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:03,890
Oh, you know me.

682
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,160
You know everything
you need to know.

683
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:11,930
Look at me.

684
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:17,280
Open your eyes.

685
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:20,320
Please.

686
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,790
Open your eyes!

687
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:36,890
You've been with another man.

688
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:41,510
No.

689
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:44,140
What are you doing, then?

690
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,940
What's going on in there?

691
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,010
Why do you keep sneaking around?

692
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:52,020
Is the suspicion exciting?

693
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,920
Do you need it go get off?
What is it?

694
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:57,910
I found Adele's letters.

695
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:03,530
You...

696
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:05,460
found...

697
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,050
her letters?

698
01:15:09,530 --> 01:15:11,300
Is that how
you tell the story?

699
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:13,870
What, they were just...

700
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:15,540
sitting with my keys
on the table...

701
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,100
and you just happened
to notice them?

702
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,260
Look what I just
happened to find!

703
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:36,890
These and these!

704
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:38,260
And I found these!
Here, read them!

705
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:40,630
I have nothing to hide, Alice!

706
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:02,710
Did you sneak around
behind my back because you...

707
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:06,560
need it to get
rougher and rougher?

708
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,390
I mean, is that it?

709
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:11,130
I'm trying
to understand you, Alice.

710
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:13,760
If you do this,
will I punish you?

711
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:17,160
Is that what your goal...

712
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,610
Please untie me.

713
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:31,740
If you trusted me...

714
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:35,980
you wouldn't be
in this position, Alice.

715
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:42,830
I just...

716
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:44,900
I wanted to know more...

717
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,600
about you.

718
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,900
And I wanted
to know your past...

719
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,330
and I wanted to know
your stories.

720
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,310
I just thought
if I knew more...

721
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:58,100
that I could love you more.

722
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:04,450
I know the only thing
that matters is us together.

723
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:06,020
I know that.

724
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:08,290
Because when
you're not around...

725
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,390
I get lost.

726
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:13,380
It drives me crazy
to think about losing you.

727
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:22,630
I'm yours, Alice.

728
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:27,270
What more do you need to know?

729
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:39,810
I could break your neck,
I love you so much.

730
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:47,260
Do you want to stay here?

731
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:48,520
I mean...

732
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:52,360
do you like this?

733
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,360
Adam, I have to pee.

734
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,280
My God.

735
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,550
Alice, please,
don't do this! Alice!

736
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,850
Please!

737
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,330
Where are you going?!

738
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:09,410
Alice, please!

739
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:11,430
What are you doing?!

740
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:41,860
And that's when
I came to you.

741
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:01,620
I want to be clear
with you.

742
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,920
In my experience,
charges of domestic violence...

743
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,460
are usually too little
too late.

744
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:07,920
I want you to reopen
the Adele Blanchard case.

745
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:12,330
It's not easy
to reopen a case like this.

746
01:21:12,330 --> 01:21:14,160
Britain is swimming
in missing persons.

747
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,300
He killed her.

748
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,300
Mrs. Tallis, any case...

749
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:21,270
missing person or murder,
needs evidence.

750
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:22,940
I have to ask you
what you have.

751
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:25,310
Adele's letters?

752
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:27,440
No.

753
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,080
Warning notes?

754
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,510
No.

755
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:33,380
You have...

756
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:34,780
two photos.

757
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:39,460
Proof of nothing.

758
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:41,090
He raped Michelle.

759
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:42,680
She never reported it.

760
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,830
Start without me.
I'll be there in a bit.

761
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:05,710
I'd like to help you,
Mrs. Tallis.

762
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:10,020
What everyone else
does to be like him.

763
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:13,020
He can't see you.

764
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:15,430
She's pretty shaken up.

765
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:17,590
Is she? I mean,
is she hurt?

766
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:19,560
She--Jesus, she was
running into traffic.

767
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,060
Let's get a doctor.

768
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:23,430
She'll be fine.

769
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:28,800
I would never hurt her.

770
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:32,680
I love her.

771
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,480
You brought him in?

772
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:38,050
He walked in,
looking for you.

773
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:39,280
He brought in
a pair of shoes.

774
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,270
He was worried
about your feet.

775
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:48,590
I believe your husband...

776
01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:51,460
has the potential
for violence.

777
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:54,330
I believe he's unpredictable.

778
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:56,630
But is he a murderer?

779
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,230
I don't know.

780
01:23:00,970 --> 01:23:03,070
The truth is, what you two
have been doing together...

781
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:04,660
was consensual.

782
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:07,300
You said it yourself.

783
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:10,040
You liked it.

784
01:23:30,270 --> 01:23:32,460
Can you close the blinds?

785
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:49,080
I won't be able to keep him
for much more than a few hours.

786
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:53,390
That's as much of a window
as I can give you.

787
01:23:53,390 --> 01:23:56,190
You're accusing a hero,
Mrs. Tallis...

788
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:58,820
and you have
absolutely no evidence.

789
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:14,640
Alice, what's happened to you?

790
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,750
Oh, Deborah, I'm sorry.

791
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:18,450
I'm not crazy,
I just--I just--

792
01:24:18,450 --> 01:24:19,680
I went to
the police station...

793
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:22,050
but no one believed me,
and I just--I just--

794
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:23,320
He came in and he
brought my shoes...

795
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:24,620
and they thought
I was nuts...

796
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:25,890
but, I mean, I know
he's your brother...

797
01:24:25,890 --> 01:24:27,420
but, I mean,
you were her friend, too.

798
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:29,290
Maybe you could, um--

799
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:30,560
Look, you remember when
you said that you were...

800
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:33,030
either with him or not,
no discussion?

801
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:35,160
Well, I'm--I'm not--
I'm trying to understand.

802
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:39,400
l--I just, I want to ask,
I mean, um--uh...

803
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,730
Was Francoise
with someone else?

804
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:51,900
Yes.

805
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,520
It wasn't an accident.

806
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,750
She left him...

807
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,660
so he killed her.

808
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:11,320
Maybe.

809
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:24,050
This is the anchor
that we used.

810
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:26,980
It's made of titanium,
but the important thing is...

811
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:29,990
it can hold
2,000 falling pounds.

812
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:31,320
I've got a friend
in Kathmandu...

813
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:34,120
who sent me an anchor
that they're making locally...

814
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,790
with the wrong material.

815
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:39,660
This is what happened
with just seventy-five pounds.

816
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:41,930
Maybe you're right.

817
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:43,930
Adam could have
switched the anchors...

818
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:45,160
for Francoise's group.

819
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:51,400
He killed them.

820
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,120
Leave him, Alice.

821
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,580
I know him.

822
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,280
You have to leave him,
for your own good.

823
01:26:37,890 --> 01:26:41,390
Deborah...Deborah,
it's not the only time.

824
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:42,530
What?

825
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:44,130
I think that, um,
he was with a woman...

826
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:45,430
Adele Blanchard,
and I think...

827
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:47,500
that she was gonna leave him
to go back to her husband...

828
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:50,330
and--and I think that--
that he killed her.

829
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,840
Adele was never gonna
go back to Michael.

830
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,270
Everyone knew
their marriage was over.

831
01:26:58,010 --> 01:26:59,340
I read her letters.

832
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:03,280
She ended it with Adam.

833
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:07,250
And, uh, I just, um...

834
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:10,190
I think that, uh,
that she's there.

835
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:11,180
What?

836
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,320
I went to the police.

837
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,330
The police,
they won't do anything.

838
01:27:16,330 --> 01:27:17,310
They need evidence.

839
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:21,430
I think he buried her here...

840
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:22,490
at Saint Edmund's.

841
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:25,560
I need you
to help me find her.

842
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:28,600
Do you want to go with me?

843
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:44,640
I have a confession to make.

844
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,010
I sent you those notes.

845
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,730
I know about
my brother's violence.

846
01:27:52,730 --> 01:27:54,250
I've seen it.

847
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,200
I should have done more, but--

848
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:00,790
it's no excuse--

849
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:04,500
but he scares me.

850
01:28:09,310 --> 01:28:11,470
I'm glad you got away
from him, Alice.

851
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:15,850
You'll be OK now.

852
01:29:53,850 --> 01:29:55,050
Can I take that?

853
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:56,350
Yeah, sure.

854
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:00,420
I think it's here.

855
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:05,090
He took the pictures
just by the angel.

856
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:48,940
Oh, my God.

857
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:32,910
She didn't have to die.

858
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:37,850
If only she'd told me...

859
01:31:37,850 --> 01:31:39,720
she was going back
to Michael.

860
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:43,950
Yeah.

861
01:31:46,330 --> 01:31:48,260
I gave her one, too.

862
01:31:50,170 --> 01:31:52,230
She thought it was beautiful,
just like you did.

863
01:31:52,230 --> 01:31:54,260
Why did you do this?!

864
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,580
Who do you think gave him
his first piece of silk?

865
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:04,210
He was just 15!

866
01:32:04,210 --> 01:32:06,840
I'm talking
about fucking, Alice!

867
01:32:08,350 --> 01:32:11,150
That's right!
We fucked right here!

868
01:32:17,890 --> 01:32:20,060
Adam is mine!

869
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:21,430
He's mine!

870
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:39,950
Why?!

871
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:42,690
I was never yours!

872
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:45,310
We were kids. Kids!

873
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:48,960
It's over.

874
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:50,220
It's all over.

875
01:32:58,500 --> 01:32:59,930
Oh, God.

876
01:34:03,530 --> 01:34:04,930
She and I...

877
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:12,130
We used to come
here together.

878
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:21,080
I just thought
you had to trust me.

879
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,030
And that's how it ended.

880
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:13,400
Yet not a day goes by...

881
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:16,770
without at least one thought
about the passion.

882
01:35:16,770 --> 01:35:19,170
Maybe I was so blinded by it...

883
01:35:19,170 --> 01:35:23,300
that I missed all the clues
to his past.

884
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:35,360
I often wonder...

885
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,690
what would have happened...

886
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:39,420
if I hadn't looked up
that morning.

887
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:52,370
Two years later,
I saw him once more.

888
01:36:30,450 --> 01:36:31,710
I don't know.

889
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:35,050
Maybe a flatlander like me...

890
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:37,450
can't live at that altitude.

891
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:40,420
Maybe it never would
have been possible...

892
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:42,750
to sustain what we had.

893
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:45,220
Maybe.

894
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:50,060
Well, that's what
I tell myself.
