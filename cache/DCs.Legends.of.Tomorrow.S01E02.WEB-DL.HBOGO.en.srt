1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,080
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,840
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,520
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,280
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,120
<i>Unfortunately, my plan is opposed</i>

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,400
<i>by the body I'd sworn
my allegiance to:</i>

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,880
<i>the Time Masters.</i>

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,120
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes</i>

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,000
<i>but if we succeed,
they will be remembered as legends.</i>

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,120
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,480
Savage has kept his movements
hidden throughout history

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,320
but professor Aldus Boardman
is the world's leading expert.

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,360
Savage was an Egyptian priest.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,600
Kendra and I reincarnate.

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,720
And every time he kills you,
it passes to him.

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,320
That's what maintains
his immortality.

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,120
Professor Boardman has sustained
severe internal injuries.

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,320
A hundred years from now,

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,040
your lives have minimal effect
on the recorded timeline.

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
You lied to us.

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,680
I don't give a damn
about being a legend

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,960
as long as we end Savage
once and for all.

23
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,760
So how do we find this guy?

24
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,120
And we've arrived.

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,720
Gideon, if you wouldn't mind
camouflaging us

26
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,360
as an alpine meadow, perhaps?

27
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,760
What are you complaining about now?

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,040
It's not like we time-jumped.

29
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,960
I hate flying, especially in
whatever this thing is.

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,600
Where exactly are we?

31
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,160
{\an5}- We're still in 1975, right?
- Indeed.

32
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,440
{\an5}October 19, 1975 on the fjords
of northern Norway.

33
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,720
Sounds like a vacation.

34
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,440
{\an5}Which we can take as soon
as the threat of Savage

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,080
has been neutralized, Mr. Snart.

36
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,320
That's Aldus's notebook.

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,960
{\an5}Now he theorized that Savage
might be here, and if he's right

38
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,080
{\an5}and if we can capture Savage,

39
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,320
{\an5}then at least Professor Boardman
didn't die in vain.

40
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,000
Can't we just go back and save Aldus?

41
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,520
He was our son.

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,080
Look, I'm sorry.

43
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,560
{\an5}We can't go back and change events
in which we participated.

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,120
Time would fold in on itself,
creating a temporal vortex.

45
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,640
Which sounds way cooler than it is.

46
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,640
Forgetting physics for a second,

47
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,600
{\an5}shouldn't we figure out
what Savage is doing in Norway?

48
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,120
According to Gideon,
there is a large meeting

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,000
of terrorists and fringe groups
looking to buy illegal arms.

50
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,040
Now that sounds like a vacation.

51
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,560
Arms dealers and terrorists
aren't exactly our kind of people

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,560
but they're the next best thing.

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,360
Well, looks like you and your lapdog
get to earn your keep.

54
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,720
I'm no one's lapdog, bird-man.

55
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,680
So what exactly does one wear

56
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,360
{\an5}to a black market arms bazaar,
anyway?

57
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,080
The Waverider has a fabrication room

58
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,520
{\an5}which can fashion
temporally-indigenous, fashion.

59
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
You've got a room
that makes clothing?

60
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
Doesn't everyone?

61
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,240
All right! First thing we need to do
is work up a plan.

62
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,200
{\an5}Got a lot of experience
infiltrating criminal gatherings?

63
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,240
{\an5}Didn't think so.
I'm calling the shots.

64
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,560
{\an5}Actually, I'm in charge,
in case any of you have forgotten.

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
No, I remember. I just don't care.

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,160
{\an5}Do I need to remind any of you
that I'm a Time Master?

67
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,120
{\an5}Making discrete alterations
to the timeline is what I do.

68
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,560
{\an5}So we're not just gonna charge
into the past

69
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,720
like a bull into a china shop...

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,840
Half of what you've told us

71
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,960
about the mission turned out
to be lies.

72
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,560
{\an5}None of you have ever encountered
Vandal Savage before.

73
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,520
{\an5}I have, and I'm telling you now,
you are making a big mistake.

74
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,240
Already did that when we trusted you.

75
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,440
Back soon, Captain.

76
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,480
{\an5}Looks like
they're checking credentials.

77
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,640
And we don't have any.

78
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,280
We got this. Trust us.

79
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,040
Excuse you.

80
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,000
IDs.

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,800
{\an5}You don't look like
an Amhad Ahmed Izz-Al-Din.

82
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,320
I'm Arab, on my mother's side.

83
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,480
Is there a problem?

84
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,560
I don't like delays.

85
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,040
Do you know who we are?

86
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,640
{\an5}My associates and I are
the operational arm of "Scimitar".

87
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,280
The Lombardo Square bombing, 1963.

88
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,440
Murder of Henri Tyran, Canada, 1970.

89
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,960
Konig Airport Massacre, 1971.

90
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,120
Bottom line?

91
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,880
You don't want to doubt me.

92
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,200
You're a special kind of crazy.

93
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,280
I like it.

94
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
We're in.

95
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,960
So why don't I get to play terrorist?

96
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,320
<i>This is just a kidnapping.</i>

97
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,200
<i>No need for your nuclear fireworks.</i>

98
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,880
Savage will be one of the buyers.

99
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,920
Once we get eyes on, hang back.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,200
{\an5}We'll boost him
once this is all over.

101
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,080
Any sign of him?

102
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,440
- No.
- He's not here, boss.

103
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,520
Let's get Ginger
and the Professor and move out.

104
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,760
If I could have your attention.

105
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,200
Thank you all for coming.

106
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,640
I promise, it will be
well worth your time.

107
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,560
Seems we were wrong about Savage.

108
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,120
He's not one of the buyers.

109
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,360
He's the seller.

110
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,680
This is a variable-yield
nuclear warhead...

111
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,520
capable of producing a blast
equivalent to one megaton of TNT.

112
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,240
Shall we begin our bidding
at 100 million dollars?

113
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,560
One hundred million.

114
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,280
Do I hear 105?

115
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,800
One hundred and ten?

116
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,080
One hundred and fifteen?

117
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,760
Is everything all right, sir?

118
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,480
They're here.

119
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,160
That group.

120
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,320
Where are they from?

121
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,240
It appears we've found
some unwanted attention.

122
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,520
We need to bid.
Fire your gun in the air.

123
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,000
That's 125.

124
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
- What's happening?
- Going once...

125
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,680
It's what's not happening
that is the concern.

126
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,600
- Going twice...
- Nobody else is bidding.

127
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,800
- Sold!
- Congratulations, Professor.

128
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,440
You just bought yourself
a nuclear weapon.

129
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,560
Well, well.

130
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,960
We seem to have a new player.

131
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,680
But you seem a bit academic.

132
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,040
How did you get in here
and who are you?

133
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,480
As of a few seconds ago,
I'm a nuclear power.

134
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,760
Yet I don't know you
or your organization

135
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,960
and I know everyone.

136
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,480
Hey. Back off.

137
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,800
Watch your tone.

138
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,640
Is there some sort of problem here?

139
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,800
Yeah. The master race here
is starting to bug me.

140
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,880
We're just gonna get our nuclear
warhead and be on our way.

141
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,520
Not without paying first.

142
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,840
Once we've validated
that the warhead's operational.

143
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,040
Personally, I find it highly unlikely
that you were able to accumulate

144
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,800
enough fissionable material
in this era

145
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,680
to fashion a workable nuclear device.

146
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,160
"This era"?

147
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,720
Figure of speech.

148
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,680
I got a feeling you guys might want
to get those helmets of yours on.

149
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,200
Change of plans.

150
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,160
I'll provide a 25 percent discount
to the organization which brings me

151
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,640
the heads of these men.

152
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,240
Can I burn some stuff now?

153
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,640
I wish you would.

154
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,520
Now would be a good time.

155
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,680
Yeah. To kill you.

156
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,400
I wasn't talking to you.

157
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,520
Savage.

158
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,840
Prince Khufu.

159
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,760
As always, the fashion plate...

160
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,760
And your better half.

161
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,760
This ends here and now, Savage.

162
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,920
You're coming with us.

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,160
I doubt you can apprehend me
and stop a nuclear explosion.

164
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,400
You screwed that up pretty good.

165
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,600
I had it handled.

166
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,400
I like how you actually believe that.

167
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,600
We got a nuclear bomb here.

168
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,840
Ray! What did you do?

169
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,880
I didn't do anything.
It must have a fail-safe.

170
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,720
Professor, Jax, we need you!

171
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,160
<i>You have to get
to a minimum safe distance.</i>

172
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,920
Okay, what now?

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,320
<i>We wait for the warhead to go off</i>

174
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,080
<i>at which point, you're going
to have .06 seconds</i>

175
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,400
<i>to absorb the massive release
of atomic energy.</i>

176
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,160
Your plan sucks.
You know that, right?

177
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,840
<i>Concentrate, Jefferson.</i>

178
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,360
{\an5}Well, I'm really glad
you were the one calling the shots.

179
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,600
I had it under control

180
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,840
{\an5}until the Professor
started picking fights with the PLO.

181
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,120
{\an5}You let your ego endanger
our entire mission.

182
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,960
No, Mr. Rory's temper got
completely out of control...

183
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,880
I thought we were friends, Professor.

184
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,800
{\an5}At least there's one less
nuclear bomb on the planet.

185
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,880
{\an5}Here, here. Now you all deserve
a hearty congratulations.

186
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
{\an5}Not only did you fail
to capture Savage.

187
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,080
You exposed yourselves
and your powers to him,

188
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,160
giving away the element of surprise
for now and all time.

189
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Well done, team.

190
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,920
We don't need
the element of surprise.

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,680
We know he's in Norway,
so let's find him...

192
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,680
Unfortunately, we now have
larger problems than Savage.

193
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,880
If only you'd have listened to me

194
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,480
about the dangers
of upsetting the timeline.

195
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
What are you talking about?

196
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,280
While you were busy saving Norway
from nuclear annihilation...

197
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,400
You're welcome, Norway.

198
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,040
Savage sent one of his cronies
back to the site of the arms sale.

199
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,760
Anyone care to guess what he found?

200
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Whoops.

201
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,840
<i>I am unversed
in modern American colloquialisms.</i>

202
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,360
<i>Is "Whoops" slang for "Oh"?</i>

203
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,880
Yes, Dr. Palmer seems to have
thrown a spanner in the works

204
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,000
- for the entire timeline.
- Come again?

205
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,720
Armed with Dr. Palmer's
future technology,

206
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,760
Savage's engineers develop
a weapon far more destructive

207
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,960
than anything here in 1975.

208
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,240
This is Central City in 2016.
At least it was.

209
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,520
I'm not sure what the neo- fascists

210
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,400
who took control of it
are calling it these days.

211
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,760
There must be a way
to correct this somehow.

212
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,360
Fortunately, Gideon
is just showing us a forecast

213
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,440
of the future you've all created.

214
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,600
Time is like cement.

215
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,760
It takes time to become permanent.

216
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,520
In this case, until Savage's team

217
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,560
have worked out the mystery
of your future technology

218
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,320
and molded it to their own ends.

219
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
And when they do...

220
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,680
what you see here
is no longer just a forecast.

221
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
This...

222
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
This is history.

223
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,520
Where is he?

224
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,640
His body, I mean.

225
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,480
There's cryo-storage in the MedBay.

226
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,800
I promise we'll get our son
a proper burial

227
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,880
once we have a chance.

228
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,800
It's still so weird
to hear you call him that.

229
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,480
But even though
it was in a past life...

230
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,000
it feels like something's missing.

231
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
I know.

232
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,960
What's that?

233
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,760
I found it in his pocket.

234
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,880
I've seen this knife before.

235
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,160
This is the knife
that Savage used to kill us.

236
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,480
In our first life.

237
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,200
So thanks to Raymond leaving
a piece of his suit in the past,

238
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,560
the rest of us don't have
a future to go back to?

239
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,520
Unless we do something
to change this course of events...

240
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,800
the future will become immutable.

241
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,400
Exactly how much time do we have?

242
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,720
Until Savage's weapons team
reverse-engineer your tech.

243
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,560
We're talking 1970s terrorists
with 21st-century weapons.

244
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,160
And since we don't know
where Savage went...

245
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,520
We don't have to find Savage.

246
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,320
We just have to find
the other piece of my suit.

247
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,360
Which shrinks
because it's made of an alloy

248
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,720
which mimics intra-molecular
compression of dwarf star,

249
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,080
thus emitting Alpha Particles.

250
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,240
So we just need
to be able to track them.

251
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,640
Fortunately, Alpha Particles
are highly trackable.

252
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,520
Yet unheard of in the 1970s.

253
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,600
It's like we're trapped
in the Stone Age.

254
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,920
I'll have you know that I
was researching Alpha Particles

255
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,320
when you were eating crayons.

256
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,680
So to track that piece
of Raymond's super-suit

257
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,520
we just need to talk to...

258
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,720
Me.

259
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,760
25-year-old me, rather.

260
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,320
You two are just in time.

261
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,800
Show them, Kendra.

262
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,840
Aldus was carrying this
when he was killed.

263
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,400
It's a newspaper article
about an Egyptian dagger.

264
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,120
The one Savage used to kill us.

265
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,000
In Central City, we learned
that objects associated

266
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,160
with the night of our deaths
can also be used to kill Savage.

267
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,200
According to Aldus's notes,
the dagger needs to be wielded

268
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,720
in conjunction
with an incantation inscribed on it.

269
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,440
What does this incantation say?

270
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,680
I don't know.
I can't read the language.

271
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,800
It's okay.
I'll help you remember.

272
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,960
Splendid. Now, as for the dagger...

273
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,640
- You need someone to steal it.
- Okay, fine.

274
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,880
Whatever. I'll do it.

275
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,000
Article says it was purchased
by some rich Russian douche bag

276
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,640
named Sasha Mahnovski.

277
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,360
- I'll go with you.
- I already got a partner.

278
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,960
Who I trust even less than you.

279
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,280
Look, you're more than welcome
to go with them.

280
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,080
Just don't take along
any of your future tech.

281
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,000
Where do you think you're going?

282
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,600
To break into my old lab and bring us
back the particle tracker.

283
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,680
Fine, but perhaps

284
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,480
you should take Jefferson
and Sara with you

285
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,280
to act as your intermediaries.

286
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,760
Look, interacting
with yourself in the past

287
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,600
can have catastrophic effects
upon the future.

288
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,800
Fascinating. Let's go.

289
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,040
<i>Setting a course
for the United States, Captain.</i>

290
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,040
<i>I heard somebody say</i>

291
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,880
<i>Burn, baby burn</i>

292
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,600
<i>Disco inferno</i>

293
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,000
People actually wore this crap?

294
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,840
People smoked
a lot of pot in the '70s.

295
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,880
It clearly had a deleterious effect
on the fashion of the era.

296
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,920
Let's just hurry up
and get that particle tracker

297
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,160
so I can get the hell
out of these go-go boots.

298
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,520
Remember, when we meet
my former self

299
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,400
it is imperative that we don't
let on we're from the future.

300
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,040
So let's just be cool.

301
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,520
Oh, my God.

302
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
Look.

303
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,640
I'd forgotten how handsome I was.

304
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,840
My hair, it's so thick and silky.

305
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
Do I know you?

306
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,400
No. No.

307
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,080
I'm Professor Musk.

308
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,920
Elon Musk.

309
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,880
And these are my two lab assistants.

310
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,120
Hi.

311
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
I'm Marty.

312
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,080
Are you sure we haven't met before?

313
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,120
That's a very interesting question.

314
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,600
Suffice it to say,
I am familiar with your work.

315
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,160
That's actually why we're here.

316
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,240
To see you.

317
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,400
You're a leading expert
in Alpha Particles?

318
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,440
No, I'm the leading expert.

319
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,400
Well, we were hoping
to pick your brain

320
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,280
about your area of expertise.

321
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,480
Physics?

322
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,160
Which are you interested in,
applied or theoretical?

323
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,240
That is just the thing.

324
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,960
I can't decide.

325
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,480
I love them both.

326
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,920
Cool.

327
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,440
Well, let's go spark a doobie
and rap about physics.

328
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,360
Lead the way, Marty.

329
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,040
Are you sure that's actually you?

330
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Oh, man.

331
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,440
Concentrate, Kendra.
You know how to read the inscription.

332
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,680
At least, you used to know.

333
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,840
Yeah, well, my hieroglyphic
is a little rusty.

334
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,520
<i>Lapidary hieratic, actually.</i>

335
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,160
<i>An ancient language lost to the ages.</i>

336
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,600
Don't you know how to read it?

337
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,280
It was a language known
only to the clergy.

338
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,000
<i>If we only had a Rosetta Stone,
I might be able to...</i>

339
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,680
Well, you are our Rosetta Stone.

340
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,080
Just close your eyes.

341
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Think of it as meditation.

342
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,920
I need you to relax
and open your mind.

343
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,160
In order for you to remember
how to kill Savage,

344
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,880
I need you to let your mind float

345
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,600
back through your hundreds
of previous lives.

346
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,200
Your name is Chay-Ara...

347
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,000
and you are a priestess
in the temple of Horus.

348
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,920
- What? What is it?
- Us.

349
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,160
We were together.

350
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,200
Like, together-together.

351
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,520
Well, I have been telling you
that you and I should be destined...

352
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,760
What are you doing?

353
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,400
What part of "destiny"
do you not understand?

354
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,960
The part where I have to stop
thinking for myself.

355
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,760
The group that disrupted
the arms auction.

356
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,960
Any idea who they were?

357
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,760
A man in a robotic suit,
weapons that shoot ice and fire.

358
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,400
Suffice it to say,
they're not from around here.

359
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,280
I would assume the future.

360
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,520
- That's impossible.
- So is immortality.

361
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,040
Besides, how else
do you explain technology

362
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,800
beyond anything we have seen?

363
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,280
What can you tell me about it?

364
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,360
It contains a miniaturized
missile-guidance system

365
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,960
capable of delivering
high-explosive ordnance.

366
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,520
You have 24 hours
to reverse-engineer it.

367
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,320
It could take weeks,
months to figure out the circuitry.

368
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,960
It looks simple enough to me.

369
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,880
You just press this button here.

370
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,880
I said 24 hours.

371
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,720
Suggest you all get to work.

372
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm seeing motion detectors
on the ground floor.

373
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,320
Hardware on the doors
looks standard issue.

374
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,040
- I can't see any smoke alarms.
- Just stay close.

375
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,960
I saw at least three armed guards
on the perimeter.

376
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,400
Right, boss.

377
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,920
- What the hell are you...
- I recognize the security system.

378
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,160
My parents had the exact one.

379
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,440
I'll have the access code cracked
and security disabled

380
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,320
before you could say
"breaking and entering".

381
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
There. We're in.

382
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,000
- I wouldn't be so sure about that.
- Why's that?

383
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,040
Because you just tapped
into a dummy box

384
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,400
which means those guards
are gonna be here...

385
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,600
Quicker than you can say
"rookie mistake".

386
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
Hands up.

387
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,240
- So, who wants a hit?
- Yeah, man...

388
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,320
I believe you told me
you were trying to quit.

389
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,080
Oh, none for you, silver top?

390
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,160
I...

391
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,920
I don't partake in cannabis.

392
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,720
Anymore, that is.

393
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,040
In fact, perhaps you should
take it easy.

394
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,960
It helps me think better.

395
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Dad.

396
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,920
Yes, but what about the long-term
health consequences?

397
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,520
Speaking of which,
you might want to lay off

398
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,160
the saturated fats.

399
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
So...

400
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,840
Alpha Particles. Oof.

401
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,720
Exciting stuff.

402
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,160
Too bad detection is
at least a decade away.

403
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,920
More like two decades.

404
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,280
But I've worked up
a little something.

405
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,840
Science is all about the future,
right?

406
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,920
I've developed a prototype
particle tracker. Cutting-edge.

407
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,080
Probably gonna mint me
a million dollars.

408
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,720
Wow. A whole million.

409
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,960
Be right back.

410
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,720
I think I've got some chocolate
chip cookie dough in the fridge.

411
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,120
I cannot believe that that is you.

412
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,920
Seriously, I had no idea
you were ever cool.

413
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,920
I wasn't cool.
I was an arrogant little snot.

414
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,400
- Was?
- What are you doing?

415
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,760
Looking for my younger self's
particle tracker.

416
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,080
Keep an eye on the door.
And when I get back,

417
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
stop flirting with me.

418
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,080
You were the one flirting with me.

419
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,400
Look, what's the big deal?

420
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,960
I mean, younger you
isn't married yet

421
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,840
so technically it's not cheating.

422
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,960
October 1975.

423
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,160
This is right when I meet
my future wife, Clarissa.

424
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,920
So obviously, we wouldn't
want my former self tempted

425
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,720
by a sexy assassin from the future.

426
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,880
You think I'm sex...

427
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,120
Do not finish that sentence.

428
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Found it.

429
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,840
Is there a trick to opening the case?

430
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,200
What are you doing?

431
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,520
Let's grab the dagger and let's go.

432
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,520
Raymond, you don't break
into a candy store

433
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,120
and steal one gumball.

434
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,080
You guys grab the goodies.

435
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,120
I'll find the safe.

436
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,840
What do you think you're doing?

437
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,600
This is what we came here for.

438
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,960
No, it's what you came here for.

439
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,200
Take your hand off me.

440
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,880
I'm not gonna let you jeopardize
another mission.

441
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,880
I'm done asking politely.

442
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,000
This is my mission.

443
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
And I'm gonna listen to a guy

444
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,600
who's spent half of his life
in prison?

445
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Great.

446
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,120
Now we're both going to prison.

447
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,480
Eureka.

448
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,080
I remember building this.

449
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,240
It's... it's like <i>déjà vu</i>
all over again.

450
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,880
Put that down.

451
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,680
Excellent job watching the door.

452
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,960
What are you doing?

453
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,160
Oh, just, what is this?

454
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,360
Something you shouldn't be
fooling around with.

455
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,160
It's very interesting-looking.

456
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,240
How about you cut the crap?

457
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,480
To which crap are you referring?

458
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,680
I hold two PhDs,
and I'm working on a third.

459
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,560
I'm a five-time winner
of the Carlin Award.

460
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,840
My point being, is I don't believe

461
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,800
either of those kids
you're hanging around with

462
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,360
can even spell "physics".

463
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,520
You know, I'm beginning to like
the younger gray less and less.

464
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,480
Either you tell me
what the hell is going on...

465
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,560
or I'm calling campus police.

466
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,520
I'm not supposed to tell you.

467
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,360
It could cause, well, trouble.

468
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,360
We're here to interview you
for a profile

469
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,080
in next month's "Wells Journal".

470
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,080
The "Wells" only profiles
Nobel candidates.

471
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,040
An exception is being made
in light of your obvious brilliance.

472
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,920
I know a photograph of this device
would make a spectacular cover

473
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,880
if we could just borrow it
for a few hours.

474
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,800
Thanks, but that's two years
of my life.

475
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,520
I'm not letting you
walk away with it.

476
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,240
Stay back!

477
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,360
That was taking too long.

478
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,160
You just knocked me out.

479
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,800
That beautiful brain,
struck unconscious.

480
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,320
The only way to shut you up.

481
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,880
What are you doing?
We have to go.

482
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,080
I have to make sure I wake up in time
to go to this faculty mixer tonight.

483
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,200
One of the professors
is bringing his niece.

484
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,480
AKA my future wife.

485
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,560
Let's go!

486
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,800
What the hell happened?

487
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,240
- It was this idiot's fault.
- Your partner's fault.

488
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,680
I told you we shouldn't
have brought him.

489
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,400
Agreed, but we got bigger problems.

490
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,080
I need you to find
the fuse box and...

491
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,680
Trigger a system default.

492
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
This ain't over.

493
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,480
How did you know how to do that?

494
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,120
When I was a kid,
my dad brought me along on jobs.

495
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,480
I had little hands.

496
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,200
I could get into tiny spaces,
do whatever he needed me to do,

497
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,640
like rewiring a security system.

498
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,640
In another life, you could've
been an electrical engineer.

499
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,480
Guess I dodged a bullet.

500
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,200
You think I want to be like you?

501
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,160
You make being a tech billionaire
sound like a bad thing.

502
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,320
You spend all your time
and money inventing a super- suit,

503
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,480
and what do you do with it?

504
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,120
Fly around like some incredible
shrinking schmuck

505
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,640
trying to save the world.

506
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,160
Robbing banks for a living...

507
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,800
I suppose that's more important?

508
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,080
It's sure as hell more satisfying.

509
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,760
Thinking like that is what
makes you a criminal.

510
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,120
No, it makes me a survivor.

511
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,280
And there's gonna come a day
when you wish you were, too.

512
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
Here.

513
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,160
You flip the solenoid,
saves you the trouble of rewiring it.

514
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,280
I take it back, Raymond.

515
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,560
You're not completely
useless after all.

516
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,120
I wanted to apologize.

517
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,280
I'm not afraid of my past.

518
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,640
I'm just unwilling
to believe that you're my future.

519
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,280
And the more you keep repeating
that we're destined to be together...

520
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,280
the more I want to prove you wrong.

521
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,760
And maybe that makes me childish,
and I'm...

522
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,720
No. It doesn't.

523
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,080
Not at all.

524
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,680
Look, 4,000 years is a long time...

525
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,240
and maybe I've been
taking us for granted,

526
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,560
expecting you to fall in love with me

527
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,440
because that's what you've done
the last 206 lifetimes.

528
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,840
But, you're right.

529
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,240
Does not make us destiny.

530
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,560
More like, probability.

531
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,880
Look, Kendra.

532
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,280
You don't have to love me
in this lifetime.

533
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,680
As many lifetimes as it takes.

534
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,960
I know you're worth the wait.

535
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,960
All right.
Well, let's try this again.

536
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
You know what to do.

537
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,480
Your name is Chay-Ara

538
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,760
and you're a priestess
in the temple of Horus.

539
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,600
You're giving me a knife
as a present?

540
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,320
Your conceptions of romance
require some adjustment, I think.

541
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
It's sacred.

542
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,240
I was told that only a high priestess
could read the inscription.

543
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,760
- It's a...
- A poem.

544
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,640
<i>"And though my soul
departs the Earth,</i>

545
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,120
<i>I count my days till my rebirth."</i>

546
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,760
<i>"I will wait across eternity
for my love to come back to me."</i>

547
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,400
The knife.

548
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,560
You gave it to me,
and the inscription...

549
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,120
it was a poem, a love poem
which promises...

550
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Promises what?

551
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,240
That we'd be together forever.

552
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,960
Perhaps I really am a genius.

553
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,360
My younger self's tracker led us
straight to Savage's lab.

554
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,920
Reading's at 96.6 percent.
It's definitely down there.

555
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,760
- Be right back.
- Wait, wait, wait.

556
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,680
Shouldn't we handle this?

557
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,000
I mean, you're pretty stoned.

558
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,280
I could be unconscious
and still be able

559
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,720
to kick the ass of a few
rent-a-thugs from 1975.

560
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Hey!

561
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,920
I do see why I found her
so attractive.

562
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,440
- Looking for this.
- Yeah.

563
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,600
And y'all have a lovely evening.

564
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,080
Looks like Rory found the fuse box.

565
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,680
We got a slight problem.

566
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,240
The owner just came home.

567
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,000
You're not gonna believe who it is.

568
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,400
We meet again.

569
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,040
Oh, I'm grateful
for another opportunity to kill you.

570
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,800
I've never saved the world before.

571
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,520
Feels good.

572
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,800
We should've picked up
some donuts on the way back.

573
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,880
Oh, my God.

574
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
My ring.

575
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,240
When you knocked me out,
I must not have woken up,

576
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,600
or did, and decided not
to go to the mixer.

577
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,680
- Clarissa.
- Holy crap.

578
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,960
Now, do you want to tell me
who you are and where you're from?

579
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,480
Stop struggling.

580
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,920
I've had 4,000 years of training

581
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,840
in every hold
and pressure point known.

582
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,080
But you already know that, don't you?

583
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,320
That I'm immortal.

584
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,760
I'm gonna kill you anyway.

585
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,040
That's a promise.

586
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,920
Oh, what have I done
to deserve such enmity?

587
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
No, let me rephrase that.

588
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,800
What have I done to you?

589
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,600
Perhaps you have targeted me
for something I've yet to do.

590
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,000
You traveled here
from some point in the future.

591
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,680
Catches on fast, this guy.

592
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,840
Visitors from another time.

593
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,560
You won't be so happy
when the rest of the team shows up

594
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,720
and knocks that smug
grin off your face.

595
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,120
Oh. Why wait?

596
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,840
A communications device of some sort,
I imagine.

597
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,960
Please.

598
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,480
Contact your friends.

599
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,920
I'm looking forward to seeing
at least two of them again.

600
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,440
Un-believable!

601
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,280
Is that a tachyon manifold?

602
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,880
Hey, how did you find us, man?

603
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,040
You think I couldn't build something
to track my own tracker?

604
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,520
Do you have any idea
what you have done?

605
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,160
What I've done?

606
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
You guys knocked me out!

607
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,080
Which we wouldn't have had
to do in the first place

608
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,880
if you weren't
such a monumental jerk!

609
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,400
Okay, can I just? Yeah.

610
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,920
Watch him, Sara.

611
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,880
Yo, you need to calm down

612
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,680
and you need to stop yelling
at yourself.

613
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,120
- His arrogant curiosity...
- Yeah.

614
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,160
He's curious and too smart
for his own good.

615
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,880
But I'm sure you can relate.

616
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,680
You're just pissed you didn't
see it coming sooner, and...

617
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,760
That's not it.

618
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:16,120
Although you are correct
in observing my ire is self-directed.

619
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,120
It's a rude awakening
when one realizes

620
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,400
that despite decades
of what one thought

621
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,360
was maturation and experience,
you haven't really changed at all.

622
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,440
That same arrogance
I derided in my younger self

623
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,560
was on full display
at the weapons bazaar.

624
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,840
Over 60 years on this planet,
and I have learned nothing.

625
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,640
I think you're being a little
too hard on yourself.

626
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,120
Which makes a nice change
from you always being hard on me,

627
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,600
but yeah, you're arrogant.

628
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,880
But you're also smart,
and kind, and selfless.

629
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,760
I mean, you want
to make the world a better place

630
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,160
and you're willing to risk everything
to make that happen.

631
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
That?

632
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,960
That is not a bad guy.

633
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,240
And neither is this one.

634
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,000
Meeting Clarissa was one
of the great moments of my life

635
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,000
and meeting you... was another.

636
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,600
You are... a fine young man,
Mr. Jackson.

637
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,440
Hey. Come on.

638
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,680
Can someone please tell me
what's going on?

639
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,080
You didn't say anything to him?

640
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,000
I figured we screwed up
the '70s enough.

641
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,480
Hey, what are you talking about?

642
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,640
Are you saying that you're...

643
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,160
Don't say another word.
Don't even think it.

644
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,040
You are to get off this ship,
post haste.

645
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,440
Oh, wonderful.
Another unauthorized passenger.

646
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,240
That worked out
so splendidly last time.

647
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,480
It's all right. He was just leaving.

648
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,520
- I'll show you out.
- So, have we met before?

649
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,880
In a manner of speaking.

650
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,400
Have a wonderful life, Martin.

651
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,000
I mean that sincerely.

652
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,760
I'm not even going to ask.

653
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,680
<i>Captain Hunter, we're getting
an incoming communiqué.</i>

654
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,600
<i>Mr. Snart on Mr. Rory's comm unit.</i>

655
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,760
On speaker.

656
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,280
<i>I'll make this short.</i>

657
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,680
The owner of the mansion
we burgled is Vandal Savage.

658
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,000
He's really interested
in meeting you guys,

659
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,080
especially our feathered friends.

660
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,280
- They have the dagger.
- And Savage has them.

661
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,360
Doesn't matter.

662
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,600
Just get me close enough,
and I'll do what needs to be done.

663
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,920
<i>I have the coordinates.</i>

664
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,840
Let's do this.

665
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,200
Your friends are cowards.

666
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,280
They'll be here.

667
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,040
They're taking too long.

668
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,600
They need an incentive...

669
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,400
The burning man.

670
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,120
I don't just burn, pal.

671
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,720
I blast things too.

672
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,480
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm pissed.

673
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,360
Stand back.

674
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,440
It's all good. Savage is down.

675
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,840
Savage is not defeated
by earthly means.

676
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,160
Well, I hit him with a nuclear blast.
So, you know, not that earthly.

677
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,480
Go get that son of a gun.

678
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,080
Are you ready to end this?

679
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
We've only been waiting 4,000 years.

680
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,720
We got company.

681
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,320
Friends of Savage.

682
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,760
You'll be needing this.

683
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,920
Don't leave any pieces of it
behind this time.

684
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,040
The Aman Dagger.

685
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,160
Of all the knives I've collected
across the centuries...

686
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,480
that one is my favorite.

687
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,320
And though my soul
departs the Earth...

688
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,320
Such a beautiful poem.

689
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,080
I remember it well.

690
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,200
Though, as you can see...

691
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,800
I can make the dagger
do its work without it.

692
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,880
Carter!

693
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,640
This was your lover's blade.

694
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,960
It must be her hand that wields it.

695
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,000
Something to consider
in your next life.

696
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
Carter.

697
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
It's okay.

698
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,880
You're gonna be okay.

699
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
I will wait...

700
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,360
through eternity.

701
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,840
Please, just save your strength.

702
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,600
Come back to me.

703
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,880
No...

704
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,040
Murderer.

705
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,280
I am not a murderer.

706
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,840
I'm a force of nature.

707
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,880
A servant of fate. I enable destiny.

708
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,840
I love you, Chay-Ara.

709
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,040
I always will.

710
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,200
But we are both tortured

711
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,680
by this circle of death
we are imprisoned by.

712
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,880
Carter.

713
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,040
He's lost.

714
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,360
Get Kendra before Savage recovers.

715
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,400
Come on,
we can still kill this bastard.

716
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,040
Kendra is the only one who can.

717
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,920
We gotta go.
Kendra needs medical attention.

718
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,160
Gideon, get us underway

719
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,520
as soon as Firestorm
and the Atom are onboard.

720
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,480
Get her to the MedBay now.

721
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,120
I assure you, Dr. Palmer, there's
nothing more you can do for her.

722
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,120
- You can't let her die.
- I don't intend to.

723
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,000
<i>Sharp force injury resulting
in rupture</i>

724
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,360
<i>of several major blood vessels.</i>

725
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,960
<i>Her pressure is currently
82 over 30 and stable.</i>

726
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,680
<i>I will begin by irrigating the wound</i>

727
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,200
<i>and cauterizing it to prevent
any further hemorrhaging.</i>

728
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
Thank you, Gideon.

729
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,040
Carter, Carter, Carter...

730
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,520
Gideon, if you wouldn't mind
administering a mild sedative.

731
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,560
No! Carter!

732
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,800
I didn't get to tell him.

733
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,640
I didn't get to tell him
it came back to me.

734
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,000
I finally remembered how I felt
about him in our past lives

735
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,640
and I didn't get to tell him!

736
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,840
I didn't get to tell him...

737
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,000
- It's okay.
- I felt the same way.

738
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,720
- How is she?
- Stable, I think.

739
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,880
Sara told me about
what's happening with your wife.

740
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,960
I'm sorry.

741
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:56,200
I was so seduced by the prospect
of time travel, of adventure.

742
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,120
I never stopped to consider

743
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,600
the consequences
of what we were undertaking.

744
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,280
Gideon has managed to stabilize
Miss Saunders's condition,

745
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,360
but another time jump
could aggravate her injuries.

746
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,160
So we're stuck in '75?

747
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,520
For the time being, yes.

748
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,520
Given that, can I have a moment
of your time, Martin?

749
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,200
There's something
that I would like to show you.

750
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,280
Of course.

751
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,800
Apparently, it's true that the guilty
return to the scene of the crime.

752
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,160
Oh, don't be so maudlin.

753
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,240
Look at your hand.

754
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,560
- How...
- I contacted your younger self

755
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,480
and encouraged him
to attend the faculty mixer.

756
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,920
Turns out one of the professors
brought along his niece.

757
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,040
You risked the timeline for me.

758
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,960
Hardly seemed fair for you
to sacrifice your wife

759
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,440
in order to save mine
from Savage's future.

760
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,720
One thing
that time travel teaches you

761
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,440
is that time changes...

762
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,440
people don't.

763
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,160
A painful realization
I've recently come to.

764
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,200
I have traveled countless ages
into the future.

765
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,320
We're still asking ourselves
the same question:

766
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Why are we here?

767
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,200
I believe that we're here
to learn, Martin.

768
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,120
Be glad that you still can.

769
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,960
Thank you, Mr. Hunter.

770
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,840
How's Kendra?

771
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,240
The same.

772
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,520
So what now?

773
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
Now?

774
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,120
- Now it's up to you.
- To do what, Rip?

775
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,040
Last I checked, every time
we try to do anything

776
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,440
it all goes to crap.

777
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,560
Oh, once again
I must disagree with you.

778
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,640
Thanks to Miss Lance,
Dr. Palmer's future technology

779
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,320
is no longer in the hands
of Vandal Savage's

780
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,440
black market weapons designers.

781
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,040
But it didn't do anything
to change the fate of your world.

782
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,920
No.

783
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,280
Vandal Savage will still rise
to power in the year 2166.

784
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,880
And your family will still die?

785
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,120
So what you're really asking is,
do we want to fish or cut bait?

786
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,960
Return to 2016 and live out
the rest of our lives

787
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,280
as insignificant losers or...

788
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,000
Make another play
at becoming legends.

789
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,440
Figure out how to end Savage
and save the world.

790
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,080
Preferably, without causing
any more nuclear explosions.

791
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,440
Savage has my attention.

792
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,720
Look, we didn't know
Carter from Adam.

793
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,000
But if you take out one of my crew,
you better pay the price.

794
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,040
Surely Captain Hunter
has a sound plan.

795
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,680
What about you?

796
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,760
You're asking me?

797
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,080
I didn't give you much
of a choice the first time, did I?

798
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,600
Well, I say we kick Savage's ass.

799
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,880
For Carter.

800
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,840
- For Carter.
- For Carter.

801
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,720
So, Captain.

802
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,040
Where are we going next?
