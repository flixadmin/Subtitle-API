1
00:00:02,504 --> 00:00:06,132
<i>The city is in chaos
and hospitals are overwhelmed.</i>

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,885
<i>C.C.P.D. advises you, stay indoors</i>

3
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:11,471
<i>as the violent speedster war escalates.</i>

4
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:17,602
Iris, I need to get back out there.

5
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:21,648
Dad, something's wrong.

6
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:23,525
- Our family...
- [throat rasping]

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,734
...the future...

8
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:26,986
It's all changed.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,404
[rasping continues]

10
00:00:28,488 --> 00:00:30,949
Flash has to do something
before it's too late.

11
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:36,329
Nora!

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,336
[breathing heavily]

13
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:47,090
What's happening?

14
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:10,071
[sirens wailing]

15
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:14,409
<i>People are getting attacked
in their offices,</i>

16
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:18,079
<i>their cars, their own homes,
and seemingly at random.</i>

17
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:21,499
So, Godspeeds are attacking folks
in their homes now?

18
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,835
You mean I could just
be hanging out at home,

19
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,253
listening to my Nas, Nasty Nas,

20
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:27,296
drinking coffee and a whole Godspeed
could just...

21
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:29,257
[groans] The Godspeeds are gone again.

22
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:30,466
You're hurt. What happened?

23
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:31,758
They ambushed me

24
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:34,679
while I was evacuating City Hall.
I barely made it out in one piece.

25
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:35,864
Okay, let's get you to the med lab.

26
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,408
- Chester, can you call Iris?
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

27
00:01:37,432 --> 00:01:40,226
No. No, she's still home feeling sick.
Let her rest.

28
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:42,145
Frost is out there, helping.

29
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,772
Chester, how long was it
before they showed up this time?

30
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:46,232
About eight hours.

31
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:48,151
But their movements are unpredictable,

32
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:50,629
and we still have no idea
where they're going once they disappear.

33
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,464
Can't we figure out
when they're going to come back next?

34
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:54,991
I could start working
on a predictive algorithm.

35
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:56,575
Right, okay.

36
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:59,288
If there's a pattern to their
freaky-deaky moves, I'll find it.

37
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:01,998
Even if we figure out
when they're gonna attack next,

38
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:05,322
I mean, we still have no idea
what these new clones want.

39
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,503
The original six want your speed.

40
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,757
Just as they were gonna get it,
six more showed up and saved you.

41
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:12,884
Right, but why? [gasps]

42
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,092
Why?

43
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:17,680
I mean, how do we stop a civil war
if we don't even understand

44
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:19,349
why both sides are fighting each other?

45
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:22,685
Hey, has anybody heard from Joe?

46
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:24,604
He left town with Kramer hours ago.

47
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:25,873
I haven't been able to get ahold of him.

48
00:02:25,897 --> 00:02:27,482
I think I know why.

49
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:30,443
Okay, this Godspeed war is causing
a build-up of electricity,

50
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:33,529
shielding Central City
in what's essentially a Faraday cage.

51
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,616
Any electronic signal
is being totally contained inside.

52
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:39,994
So no one in the city can text or call
the outside world right now.

53
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:41,286
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:43,974
Cecile, if there's one thing
Joe knows how to do,

55
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,208
it's take care of himself.

56
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:48,127
And right now,
anywhere is safer than Central City.

57
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:06,437
Ah. You got out.

58
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,485
Two against one.

59
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:14,654
Not fair.

60
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,450
[beeps]

61
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:26,958
[weapon powers up]

62
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,166
Time to go huntin'.

63
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,132
[breathing heavily]

64
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,215
So that was quick.

65
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:37,760
How did you know
he had us in his sights?

66
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:38,844
That light.

67
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:42,223
I'd recognize the signature
of Adam's pulse rifle anywhere.

68
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:43,558
[keypad beeping]

69
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:44,683
You okay?

70
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,060
I'm alive, so I'm good.

71
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:47,844
We need to get backup, though.

72
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,063
[line beeping]

73
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:50,815
Damn it. I can't get a signal.

74
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:54,652
He's jamming cell service
to keep us isolated...

75
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:58,406
which means he knows
we didn't die in that blast.

76
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,490
We need to keep moving.

77
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,123
[Barry groans]

78
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:12,253
Easy. You still have six broken ribs
and some internal bleeding.

79
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,505
Another hour of speed healing,
I'll be fine.

80
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:16,048
Those Godspeeds will be back soon.

81
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:17,507
I need to be ready.

82
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,677
Look, I've patched you up enough times

83
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:23,389
to know that this isn't about
some broken bones or clones

84
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:26,267
or even Iris being under the weather.

85
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:28,728
I had a dream about Nora.

86
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:31,856
My Nora, from the future.

87
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:34,567
It was the second dream, actually.

88
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,402
This time she was so afraid.

89
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:42,033
She told me the future had changed
and that I needed to do something.

90
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:46,996
I know it was just a dream, but...

91
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:50,833
Caitlin, I'm really worried.

92
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:54,879
When Godspeed
was Nora's enemy from 2049,

93
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,672
if all these other Godspeeds
are here now,

94
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:58,925
well, what does that mean
for the future of my family?

95
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:01,344
What if it somehow means...

96
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:03,179
Your Nora doesn't exist anymore.

97
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,226
You could go check on her.
Run to the future.

98
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:11,896
I want to, but I'd risk causing
another Flashpoint.

99
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:14,732
Plus, more Godspeeds
could show up at any moment.

100
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:17,610
Then you wouldn't be here to fight them.
I get it. You're right.

101
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,696
I can't leave. Not while there's
a civil war in the city.

102
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:22,490
Maybe I can help with that.

103
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:26,869
- John?
- Digg.

104
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:28,746
Barry. Caitlin.

105
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:30,915
I brought you something.

106
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:32,499
What is it?

107
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,337
If we're lucky, a way to end this war
before someone gets killed.

108
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,853
It's called an entropy trap.

109
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,864
And hopefully,
it's going to save your city.

110
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:55,435
[Chester] Wait, wait, wait!

111
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:59,652
So you're saying that John Diggle
is gonna help us end the Godspeed war?

112
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:00,945
Aka Spartan.

113
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,697
Aka Oliver Queen's right-hand man.

114
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,158
Aka the heart and soul of Team Arrow.

115
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:08,285
Yeah.

116
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,079
[all chuckling]

117
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,517
[Diggle] And this is something that
Cisco cooked up after you called him

118
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,209
and gave him the 411 on Central City.

119
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:19,255
Digg, when we reached out for help,
I had no idea he was going to send you.

120
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:21,883
He didn't. I volunteered, man.

121
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:26,387
You're fighting a war, Barry.
I know something about that.

122
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:30,892
And with a battle-tested soldier like
you on our side, we're gonna win.

123
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:34,061
This motion-detection plate

124
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:35,980
has a response time

125
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:37,857
of a picosecond.

126
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:44,363
And now it's live.

127
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,532
Hey, do you mind handing me that thing?

128
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:49,327
Oh, yeah. Absolutely, yeah.

129
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,371
I mean, like, absolutely, I don't mind
kind of... [chuckles nervously]

130
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:53,956
I'm the new guy, by the way. Chester.

131
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,125
Big fan, man. Big fan.

132
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,208
Thanks.

133
00:06:58,002 --> 00:06:59,795
All right, guys,
you might wanna stand back.

134
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,762
Oh, dope.

135
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:11,474
So the plasmatic wave eliminates
all entropy from any object

136
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:13,225
or person.

137
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:16,520
Yep, freezing it in time.

138
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:26,071
Guys...

139
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:31,118
If we could trap one of these Godspeeds,
find a way to communicate with it...

140
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:33,454
We can find out what they want
and why they're fighting.

141
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,664
And end this thing.

142
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:37,142
All right, once we've caught one,

143
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,560
we'll bring it back here
for questioning.

144
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,603
[Diggle] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

145
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,754
You want to invite the enemy
into your house, Barry?

146
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:42,837
Is that a good idea?

147
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,134
Look, these new Godspeeds
saved my life last night.

148
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:51,806
If there's any chance of finding allies
in this war, it's with them.

149
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:53,598
Right.

150
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,726
[gasps]

151
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:00,314
- Are you all right?
- [Diggle] Yeah.

152
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,900
Yeah, I'm fine.

153
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:06,737
Let's go catch a speedster.

154
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:12,451
This band is made
of the same metal alloy as your mask,

155
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:13,869
so your body won't reject it.

156
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:17,123
It'll maintain the laryngeal structure,
but you're good to go.

157
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,333
No more updates, no more surgeries.

158
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:21,502
I'll let you two catch up.

159
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,636
You going somewhere?

160
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,263
I have work to do.

161
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:34,682
[thumps]

162
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:37,058
[sighs]

163
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:40,896
This is on some old
Black Hole security squad.

164
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,443
Wait. Are you serious?

165
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,778
You're going after the dregs
of Black freaking Hole

166
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,613
before your anesthesia
has even worn off?

167
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:50,865
You have a death wish?

168
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:55,244
Those who survived Carver's reign
are digging up old bank accounts,

169
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,247
giving money to those
same doctors who hurt me.

170
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,498
[speaking Spanish]

171
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,004
I get it. These are bad dudes,

172
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,464
like, really bad.

173
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:08,734
But they can wait
'cause you have to heal first.

174
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:09,758
[speaking Spanish]

175
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:14,013
[in English] I have a chance
to stop them now.

176
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:16,098
I may not get another.

177
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:19,435
What about your chance
at a new beginning?

178
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,145
Caitlin just saved your voice.

179
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,313
And probably your life.

180
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:25,024
You really want to risk it
for some Black Hole scum?

181
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,359
[gasps]

182
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:29,236
[Allegra] Damn it! Esperanza...

183
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:31,405
You are not strong enough to fight them.

184
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:32,782
So help me!

185
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:34,617
So you can get more blood on your hands?

186
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:35,742
No!

187
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:40,581
Fine, no killing.

188
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:44,668
But we will do this together,
as a family.

189
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:45,961
[speaking Spanish]

190
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:49,672
I can't.

191
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:51,175
It has to wait.

192
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,845
There is a war going on, <i>prima.</i>

193
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,847
A whole lot of lives are in danger.

194
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,140
This city needs me.

195
00:09:58,224 --> 00:09:59,809
Team Flash needs me.

196
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:01,018
[in English] I need you.

197
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:05,147
Those doctors will torture others
if I do nothing.

198
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:06,982
Just wait.

199
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:09,110
As soon as this is over,

200
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,196
I promise, I will help you.

201
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:13,864
[speaking Spanish]

202
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:34,592
The clones are back.

203
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,447
It seems like they came back
awfully fast this time.

204
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,513
Flash, we got company.

205
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:41,559
I'm ready, Chester. Do it.

206
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,229
[beeping]

207
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,310
[Chester] Signal activated.

208
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,068
[electronic pulse sounding]

209
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:55,823
Hey, Flash's suit is emitting a signal
identical to the original Godspeeds.

210
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,409
So the new Godspeeds
will think that he's their rival...

211
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,743
When he's really bait.

212
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:04,873
We got one.

213
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:27,937
[Caitlin] What happened?

214
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,064
Did it work?

215
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:30,566
It worked, all right.

216
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,675
That's something
you don't see every day.

217
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:53,255
Okay, so... why isn't he talking?

218
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:54,756
He's a soldier.

219
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:59,011
He'll talk when he's ready,
and not a moment sooner.

220
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:07,770
So, word at A.R.G.U.S.
is you are leveling up, Cecile.

221
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:11,190
Hmm. Didn't know you guys
kept tabs on us ordinary people.

222
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,609
I guess that means
you're far from ordinary.

223
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,781
Speaking of, can you sense
what's going on inside his mind?

224
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,282
No. Barry already had me try,

225
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:25,913
and the only thing that I could feel
was hatred and determination.

226
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:28,832
Why isn't he trying to make contact
with the rest of his team?

227
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,877
Oh, he's trying, but I'm sending out
serious interference.

228
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:33,378
He can't get through.

229
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,339
She's our own personal signal jammer.

230
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,481
Well, that'll come in handy
in the field.

231
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,677
This whole team is leveling up.

232
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,975
Guys, it might not understand me.

233
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,370
[Chester] <i>I think it might be a drone.</i>

234
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,103
Maybe.

235
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,064
Cue up your translator.

236
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:55,067
[Godspeed clone] A translation
will not be necessary.

237
00:12:58,612 --> 00:12:59,612
So you can speak.

238
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,031
[Godspeed clone] Yes.

239
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,827
And we have much to discuss,
Barry Allen.

240
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:18,674
Now, where, oh, where could she be? Hmm?

241
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:28,559
[exhales]

242
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:30,858
You want to tell me
why he's trying to kill us?

243
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,353
No idea.

244
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,482
But killing is what
the Army taught him to do, so...

245
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:37,067
- We need to move.
- Hey.

246
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,195
If we head north, we can hit
the main road in about an hour.

247
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:41,529
I'm not letting him go.

248
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,700
I'm not going into a suicide mission.

249
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,827
Look, you do what you have to do.

250
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,331
The 12 soldiers Adam killed
were my family.

251
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:54,209
I promised I would do whatever it takes
to get them justice.

252
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:55,961
Justice is that way.

253
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,898
So while I'm gonna do
whatever it takes to finish this,

254
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,215
I won't ask you to do the same.

255
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:04,094
Hey, I'm not gonna let you
go after him alone.

256
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:05,888
I got your back. But Kramer...

257
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:08,307
if he did everything he could do

258
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,435
to make sure you weren't a part
of Operation Griffin,

259
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,838
why would he try to kill you now?

260
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,482
He doesn't know who he's hunting.

261
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,902
If he doesn't know
who he's trying to kill,

262
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,446
I know how we can catch him.

263
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:24,823
And I know what we're gonna need.

264
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,699
Let's go.

265
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,209
You've been listening this whole time.

266
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,797
- Why talk now?
- I needed to be sure.

267
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:43,258
In this war,
we fight versions of ourselves.

268
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,388
But when two sides are evenly matched,
there is no winning,

269
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,264
only endless suffering.

270
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:51,683
I know now you are strong.

271
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:55,396
You are the advantage we need
to achieve our goal.

272
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,648
- Which is?
- To live!

273
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:02,194
We did not ask to be born,
but we do ask not to die.

274
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:07,574
The others, they want your speed
to give to their master, August Heart.

275
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:12,788
But upon completion of their mission,
they will bow down to his final edict.

276
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:15,040
Total submission.

277
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:17,709
And once they do, they'll die?

278
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,712
[Godspeed clone]
We do not want that fate.

279
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:25,759
I understand the need
to defend yourselves.

280
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,221
But if you're from the future,
why bring your war here?

281
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,390
[Godspeed clone] We had no choice.

282
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,601
The prime August Heart is here,
in this time.

283
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,478
That's what they're all doing.

284
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:40,065
That's what they're doing.
They're searching for August Heart.

285
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:41,650
And whoever finds him first...

286
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,402
Wins the whole damn war.

287
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,322
[Godspeed clone] We are on
the same side, you and I.

288
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,283
We have the same goal.

289
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:54,371
Stop one man from gaining a power
so great it would destroy us all.

290
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,498
So join us, Flash.

291
00:15:56,874 --> 00:16:00,252
And by doing so, you can end this war.

292
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,087
Save your city.

293
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:03,547
Save your family.

294
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,174
If I do help...

295
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:08,469
what happens to August Heart
once we find him?

296
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,046
[Godspeed clone] We kill him.

297
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:14,600
Until he is dead,
our freedom will be compromised.

298
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,018
I won't kill.

299
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,062
Not even an enemy.

300
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:21,552
[Godspeed clone] Then know this.

301
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:26,570
Anyone who stands in our way
will die with him.

302
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:31,366
Uh... Godspeed's biometrics show
he just tapped into his speed.

303
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,784
Barry, turn on the trap.

304
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,171
[grunts]

305
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:47,715
[groans]

306
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,844
[Godspeed clone] If you are not an ally,
you are an enemy.

307
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,222
[grunts]

308
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:57,725
Let him go.

309
00:16:58,143 --> 00:16:59,186
[grunts]

310
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,572
[breathing heavily]

311
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,082
- Is everyone okay?
- How did he get out?

312
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,793
I don't know. The meta cell
should have kept him powerless, but...

313
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:27,673
Oh, man. Godspeeds
are fueled by a velocity formula.

314
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,758
A chemical Speed Force substitute.

315
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:33,470
Which means he's an artificial meta,
so dampeners wouldn't do anything.

316
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,598
So why didn't he just peace out
as soon as we un-froze him?

317
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,267
We thought we were interrogating him.

318
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:40,602
He was interrogating us.

319
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,063
Chester, you have to fix this.

320
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:48,068
Uh... I'm sorry, but Cisco built this
core with original Time Trapper tech.

321
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,671
That kind of tech's one of a kind.
I can't...

322
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:51,695
You have to.
It's the only way to stop one of them.

323
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,574
Barry, this isn't junk.

324
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:56,910
Okay, without access to bleeding-edge
temporal components, there's just...

325
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:57,994
Then find another way!

326
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,832
[sighs]

327
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:06,628
Chester, Allegra,
give me a second with Barry.

328
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,158
So you want to tell me
what's really got you so upset

329
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:21,062
that you're talking
to your teammates like that?

330
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,223
And don't tell me
it's about some broken tech, Barry.

331
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,480
It's my daughter...

332
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:28,274
Nora.

333
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,613
Before she came to join us,
she lived in the future.

334
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,031
2049.

335
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,327
The exact time Godspeed's from.

336
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,722
Okay. And with everything
that's going on,

337
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:42,346
you think it affects the future somehow?

338
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:45,167
Digg, if August Heart is here, what...

339
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,545
What does that mean for Nora
and the future of our family?

340
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,129
Is she okay?

341
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:52,841
Will Iris and I still have a family?

342
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,010
Is Nora even alive
in the future anymore?

343
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:01,224
Now, all I want to do is run to 2049
and make sure Nora's okay.

344
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,603
See with my own eyes
that my daughter's safe.

345
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:06,938
But I can't do that.

346
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,065
Why not?

347
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,903
Digg, you know better than anyone
what could happen if I did.

348
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:17,366
Besides, man, with this civil war
destroying the city,

349
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,260
staying here to fight
is the right thing to do.

350
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,369
No, it's not.

351
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:24,039
Barry, I lived a long life
here on this Earth.

352
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:27,084
I've been a spy, a vigilante, a soldier.

353
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,710
Hell, I've even been the Green Arrow.

354
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,880
The most important job
I've ever had is as a dad.

355
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,275
And there's not a bullet
I wouldn't take,

356
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,510
there's not a timeline
that I wouldn't risk changing

357
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:38,512
if it meant protecting my family.

358
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:41,347
I know that now.

359
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,015
Lyla...

360
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,977
my kids, they're my heart, man.

361
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,606
My soul, my entire world.

362
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,734
How far would I go for them?

363
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,653
As far as it takes.

364
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,322
Everything else be damned.

365
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,703
Don't be afraid to do the same.

366
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:16,675
- [Cecile] Hey.
- Hi.

367
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,262
Godspeeds are gone again.
How are you holdin' up?

368
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:24,766
Cecile, as long as these Godspeeds
are here,

369
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:28,353
I can't shake the feeling
that my family's future is in trouble.

370
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,483
That's why I need to go
and make sure my daughter's okay.

371
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,151
Nora? How?

372
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,654
I'm gonna run to 2049.

373
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,157
It's... I know, it's dangerous,

374
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,201
but I'd risk anything
to keep this family safe.

375
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,704
Yeah, well, you and me both.

376
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:48,540
Which is why I've been reading this.

377
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:49,915
- Nora's journal?
- Yeah.

378
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,168
Iris gave it to me.

379
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:55,589
Apparently,
she has been looking for

380
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,716
anything about the original
August Heart.

381
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,694
Yeah, I know.
Even when she's under the weather,

382
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,195
your girl is thinking
of ways to help us.

383
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:07,184
Now, turns out Nora mentioned a few
places that seemed personal to Heart.

384
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,352
So if he really is here in 2021,

385
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,438
Iris thinks he's hiding at one of those.

386
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,273
But without the entropy trap,

387
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,777
finding Heart first is our best chance
at ending this war.

388
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,695
Exactly. And with Iris
out of commission,

389
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,363
I'm about to go follow up for her.

390
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:24,910
Cecile, I mean, going after Heart
by yourself is dangerous.

391
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:29,456
Okay. Then I'll take John
and Allegra with me.

392
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,345
- Thanks for coming.
- Happy to help.

393
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,639
Where's Allegra?
We could've used the extra firepower.

394
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,974
I know. I called, I texted.
Still nothing.

395
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:49,643
[shouts and groans]

396
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,063
Do you hear that? Do you hear that?

397
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,314
No. John?

398
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,399
John, hey, are you all right?

399
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,151
[groans] It's just headaches.

400
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,445
But this one's a lot worse
than the others.

401
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:01,445
Okay.

402
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:02,990
Are you sure that that's all it is?

403
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,453
Oh! [gasping]

404
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:11,413
[Cecile] It's too much.

405
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,960
It's like... fighting a hurricane.

406
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,295
[grunting]

407
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,467
[panting] Okay.

408
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,761
John, buddy, I don't know what that was,

409
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,846
but that was a hell of a lot more
than a headache.

410
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:29,224
I... I felt something.

411
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:34,020
I don't know what it was,
but it felt huge.

412
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:40,861
No. More like... infinite.

413
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:42,194
John.

414
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:44,489
- Maybe you should stay here.
- No.

415
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,868
No, I'm fine. I promise.

416
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:49,768
If there is something really wrong,

417
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,289
the doctors in Gotham would've found it.

418
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:54,582
I don't think...

419
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:58,795
Really, whatever it is,
I can handle it when we're done here.

420
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,548
- [elevator dings]
- [Diggle clears throat]

421
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,178
Let's just find Heart
while we still have the chance.

422
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,912
[Caitlin] Comms aren't working
in the Speed Force for some reason,

423
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:16,521
but you'll have mobile Gideon with you.

424
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:17,605
Okay.

425
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,190
Chester...

426
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:23,778
about earlier, I was out of line.

427
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:25,529
I'm sorry.

428
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:28,617
Thanks for saying that.

429
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,744
And look, I totally get it.

430
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,288
I was just trying to keep the city safe.

431
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:35,915
Good luck.

432
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:06,363
[Gideon] Now passing 2022, 2023.

433
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,031
Warning, Barry Allen.

434
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:10,867
Temporal passage blocked
by invasive forces.

435
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:11,951
Warning.

436
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:19,000
[grunts]

437
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:20,835
[groans]

438
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:28,842
Deon?

439
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,260
Are you okay?

440
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:33,014
Yeah.

441
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:37,143
Good... because we got
a lot to talk about.

442
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:45,901
Deon, what's happening?

443
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,446
I mean, a second ago,
I was in the Speed Force.

444
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,407
Those clones, they attacked me.

445
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,534
Yeah, I know.
It's kind of crazy stuff, right?

446
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,512
What were they doing
in there in the first place?

447
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:56,496
Feeding on pure Speed Force energy.

448
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:59,290
It's pretty tasty
to their artificial cells,

449
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:00,917
only they can't hold onto it for long.

450
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,336
That's why they keep
coming back for more.

451
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,504
Does the Speed Force know?

452
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:05,713
Hell, yeah.

453
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,258
Man, those wannabes in white

454
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,592
infesting the Speed Force
like damn roaches.

455
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:13,972
Now, big sis has got her hands full
trying to exterminate their sorry asses.

456
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:15,348
That's why I stepped in.

457
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:18,101
Wait, Deon, you can control time.

458
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,769
You can take me to 2049.

459
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,229
No, man, not till she's done.

460
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,565
Look, until then,
it's solo trips only.

461
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:25,824
All right,
it's too dangerous for anyone else.

462
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:29,403
Besides...

463
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,449
I kind of don't have the strength.

464
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:35,243
Pretty busy right now.

465
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:37,202
Doing what?

466
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,740
[Iris West] Keeping me safe.

467
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:43,917
Iris?

468
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:47,714
What are you doing here?

469
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,467
Turns out I have more
than just a bad cold.

470
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,219
[gasps and groans]

471
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:54,429
What's wrong?

472
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,057
I'm okay. I'm okay.

473
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,267
Thanks to Deon.

474
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:03,646
Barry, something is causing me
to move in and out of our timeline.

475
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:06,524
How is this possible?

476
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,608
We don't know.

477
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:11,488
But Mom's been phasing
through temporal planes, man.

478
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,540
Look, I don't know why,
but once I sensed it,

479
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,935
I knew I had to step in and help.

480
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:17,952
Look, I've been using all my stillness
just to stabilize her.

481
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,914
Otherwise she'd fracture
through time itself.

482
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:23,166
I can keep her alive...

483
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,794
as long as she stays here with me.

484
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:28,713
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

485
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:30,608
I know I should have just told you
what I was gonna do,

486
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:33,426
- there just wasn't time.
- No, it's all right.

487
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:35,720
Thanks for looking out for us.

488
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:38,890
How long do you have to stay here?

489
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:42,977
I don't know, but I trust Deon.

490
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:44,561
Thanks, but...

491
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:48,149
Look, I'm using all my energy just
trying to keep you here this long.

492
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:52,362
I got to put you back inside
a pure temporal stream, right now.

493
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,572
- I'm coming with her.
- Man, you can't.

494
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:56,616
Moving back and forth
through that kind of power

495
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:59,077
ain't recommended, even for a speedster.

496
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,579
Besides, man, you've got a war to fight.

497
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,416
- Iris, we can't just...
- Barry, we have to.

498
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,419
It's my only chance.

We got to go.

Deon, you have to find a cure
for whatever this is,

502
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:19,751
- whatever's happening.
- I will.

You all right?

Yeah, I am, since you had my back.

It happened again.
I gotta get you out of here.

Caitlin needs to examine you.

520

[panting] No.

[Chester] Uh...

524

Isn't he supposed to come back
at the exact same time?

00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,272
Yeah.

it's because something's gone wrong.

I never should have let you go.

I should have chosen you,

But you did not.

You sure this is the right place?

547
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,070
Yeah. Iris's notes say that August Heart
works at this address in 2049.

548
00:31:02,195 --> 00:31:04,989
But in our time,
Dayton Labs hasn't been built yet.

- Yeah.
- What's your name?

559
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:38,106
[hesitating] I don't know.

560
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:39,731
Okay.

561
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:42,860
Okay. Well, look, we got to get you
out of here. It's not safe.

00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:44,445
No, no, no. I can't leave.

It's important.

it's so important to you?

There isn't one.

Oh, you can try.

576
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:27,697
You could shoot me.

577
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:29,449
Light me on fire.

578
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:33,202
I know it's a trap,
but I've died before.

579
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:35,413
Seventeen times, actually.

580
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:37,472
So why don't you give me your best shot?

581
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:40,042
'Cause I can't be killed. Hmm?

582
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:43,754
Is that why you killed
12 innocent soldiers from Fort Dakota?

583
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:46,549
Because you knew they'd die
and you wouldn't?

Kristen.

You were like a brother to me, Adam.

00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,232
How could you do it?

589
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:07,945
I'll tell you. Right after you tell me
who the hell you are.

590
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:11,824
'Cause Kristen Kramer
died in that explosion.

591
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,369
And that means you're dead.

592
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,039
What's he on about, Kramer?

593
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:22,043
I don't know... and I don't care.

594
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,671
All I care about
is why you killed our unit.

595
00:33:26,214 --> 00:33:27,590
Was it money?

596
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,425

I would have helped.

Trouble?

Listen, I'm immortal.

600
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:39,018
And once I discovered that,

601
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:42,271
I realized the world was meant for me,
because I deserved it.

602
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:44,607
What you deserve is life in prison.

603
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:47,151
Really? I gave my life to the Army,

604
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:49,195
and where did it get me, huh?

605
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:51,906
Nightmares and a kick in the teeth.

606
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:56,369
That's when I realized
I'd go down broke or live it up rich.

607
00:33:56,702 --> 00:34:00,081
'Cause there's plenty of folks out there
willing to pay for my new talents.

608
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:03,626
Look at him,
trying to figure out what I am.

609
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:07,797
I already have. You're the kind of meta
that gives the others a bad name.

610
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:10,550
You killed innocent people.

611
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:12,093
I finished a job.

612
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,296
[Kramer] You're a mercenary.

613
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:15,721
Did I ever know you at all?

614
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:18,099
You're the only one who knows me, Kris.

615
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,977
Sure, I'll kill anyone
if the price is right.

616
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:23,396
But I take half the money I make

617
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:26,190
and I give it back to the res
to build something good.

618
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:27,900
Something we never got.

619
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:30,570
Doing something good
doesn't erase something evil.

620
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:35,074
Oh, yeah? You tell that to the kids
that look like you and me.

621
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:36,659
They got futures now.

622
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:39,996
Everything I did, I'd do it again.

623
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:43,374
- You're not even sorry.
- Kramer.

624
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:44,457
Stand down.

625
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:51,090
Kristen... It's not worth it.

626
00:34:58,431 --> 00:34:59,432
Come on.

627
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:04,353
[chuckles]

628
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,239
[Chester] Hmm. Uh...

629
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:18,534
If this is the real August Heart,

630
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:22,747
shouldn't he be in, like,
I don't know, triple lockup

631
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,416
- at A.R.G.U.S. or something?
- Right now, it's just a feeling.

632
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,836
Yeah, we need to find a way
to prove it, one way or the other.

633
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,421
It's what Iris would want.

634
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:32,465
Based on everything you told us,
being with Deon

635
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:34,634
is the safest place
for Iris to be right now.

636
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:37,011
Yeah, I mean, we've all seen
what the Still Force can do.

637
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,722
If anyone can keep her safe, Deon can.

638
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:44,268
All right, right now, let's stay focused
on keeping the city safe.

639
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:45,895
Right. Right. Okay.

640
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,731
I just finished running the algorithm
on the Godspeed disappearances.

641
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:53,611
Turns out these clones are coming back
exponentially faster each time.

642
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:57,782
- How long do we have?
- At first it was eight hours, then four.

643
00:35:57,865 --> 00:35:59,241
And now?

644
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:02,703
If we're lucky, 90 minutes.
This war is about to go turbo.

645
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:07,041
Cecile, can you sense
anything from this guy?

646
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:10,252
Yeah, I tried. The only thing
I'm picking up is the same fear

647
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:12,546
that anyone suffering
from memory loss would have.

648
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:18,052
Whoever this person is,
he seems like somebody who needs help.

649
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:20,304
I ran complete diagnostics on him.

650
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:24,517
There's no sign of speed powers,
organic or artificial.

651
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,768
But take a look at this.

652
00:36:26,686 --> 00:36:29,480
His neurological scans
show severe memory degradation,

653
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:32,942
but his somatic memory cells
are still intact.

654
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,403
- They're just inactive.
- Can we access them?

655
00:36:35,486 --> 00:36:38,280
I could give him a nano dose
of neurogenic dark matter.

656
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:41,367
It might reactivate the cells,
but it's risky

657
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,202
and the effects would only be temporary.

658
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:47,081
I think if there's a chance
that what's inside his head

659
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:50,543
could save lives, it's worth trying.

660
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:55,423
As long as he agrees.
Let's get the shot ready.

661
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:56,841
I'll ask if he's willing to help.

662
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:07,226
Tell Cisco that I have scanned
every element, and I am on the case.

663
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:11,355
If there's any way to duplicate
this Time Trapper tech, we'll find it.

664
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:12,440
I know you will.

665
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:15,274
You got skills, man.
This team's lucky to have you.

666
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:19,655
Thanks, man. So, see you soon?

667
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:22,324
For sure. Take care of yourself.

668
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,077
[Chester laughs softly]

669
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,121
[Diggle chuckles]

670
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:30,916
Are you leaving?

671
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:36,314
There's something I've been
putting off for far too long,

672
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:37,757
and today it nearly got me killed.

673
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,212
And now I have to deal with it.

674
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:49,935
I get it. It's just this war.

675
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,812
We need all the help we can get.

676
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,380
Barry, you think I don't know that?

677
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:59,570
As much as everything inside of me
wants to stay and help you fight,

678
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,030
in my heart and soul, man...

679
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:04,575
I know I can't put this off any longer.

680
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:06,494
All right, well,

681
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:08,513
whatever's going on,
let us know if you need anything.

682
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:09,537
Yeah.

683
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:11,332
Thanks, man.

684
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,045
[both sigh]

685
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:18,380
And Barry...

686
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:23,594
- Good luck with everything.
- Thanks.

687
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,485
- Will this hurt?
- No.

688
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:46,200
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- I need to know who I am.

689
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:50,663
And if you think
this could really help...

690
00:38:52,957 --> 00:38:55,835
then do it.

691
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:07,304
[exhales slowly]

692
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:09,888
Can you tell me your name?

693
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,016
My name is...

694
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:14,143
[groans softly]

695
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:16,729
[gasps]

696
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:18,315
My name is...

697
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:20,609
It's okay. Take your time.

698
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:26,782
August.

699
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:39,169
[Cecile] It's him.
August Heart, the real Godspeed.

700
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:41,338
Only, that's all we could
get out of him.

701
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:43,299
His memory loss is too severe.

702
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:47,011
So even though we found him,
we're back to square one.

703
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,388
[sighs]

704
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:51,557
Damn it.

705
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,059
Barry, you never said what happened
when you went to 2049.

706
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:56,437
I never made it.

707
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,981
Those clones were blocking my path.
I couldn't get past them.

708
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:02,192
Now I can't check on Nora,
plus, I can't help Iris.

709
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:05,112
This war keeps getting worse.

710
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:09,450
Cecile, even with all my speed,
I've never felt so helpless.

711
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:11,744
Barry,

712
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:17,666
it's okay to be scared... and angry.

713
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:21,545
But I just need you to save
a little bit of room for hope,

714
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:24,798
'cause no matter how bad
things might seem right now,

715
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:27,301
we will get through this.

716
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:34,099
All right. I am gonna
check in with Chester.

717
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:37,811
- He's trying to help me reach Joe.
- All right.

718
00:40:38,187 --> 00:40:39,187
Okay.

719
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:43,150
[sighs]

720
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,531
- Hey, Dad.
- Nora!

721
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:52,826
And yes, before you say anything,
I know I'm not supposed to be here.

722
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:56,455
- But it's really important, I promise.
- Thank God you're okay.

723
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:01,418
Well, yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

724
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:04,463
Because I...
Well, I couldn't get to the future.

725
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:06,382
And then with Iris gone...

726
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:08,902
Wait. But if you're here, that means...

727
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:12,680
Oh, right. Don't worry.
Mom's gonna be okay.

728
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:15,641
I'm proof that everything
works out all right.

729
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:17,059
We both are.

730
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:19,352
You...

731
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:21,145
You and Iris?

732
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:25,317
Not exactly. Um...

733
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:29,613
But, uh... Hey, I mean,
if you're happy to see me,

734
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:33,575
you're gonna be twice as happy
in just a second.

735
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:34,743
[Nora chuckles]

736
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:38,080
Whoo! [laughs]

737
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:40,582
[exclaims] What did I miss?

738
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:42,751
Dad, meet your son, Bart.

739
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,046
Hey, Dad. What's good?
Or Pops. Can I call you "Pops" yet?

740
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,357
You like it when I call you
"Pops" later.

741
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:48,733
I can't remember when that is, though.

742
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:51,510
Yo, this place is crash!
