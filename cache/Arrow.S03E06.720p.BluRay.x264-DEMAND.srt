1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,686
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,686
After five years in hell,
I have come home with only one goal:

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,843
To save my city.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,767
Now others have joined my crusade.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,082
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,563
To the rest of Starling City...

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,881
...I am someone else.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,130
I am something else.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,248
Previously on Arrow:

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,721
My sister, she was murdered.
I can't tell anyone.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,207
You were swinging at your sister's killer.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,284
Don't train for that.
All right? Train for yourself.

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,807
The serum you were exposed to...

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,122
...it changes your body,
but it also warps your mind.

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,046
- You're not moving very quickly this morning.
- I didn't sleep much last night.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,450
What are you doing here?

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,204
Roy.

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,130
Where'd you go?

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,046
- Sorry.
- Get your head in the game.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,004
We're in position.

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,162
So is the Culebra Cartel and their heroin.

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,847
They all showed up about 3O minutes ago,
haven't moved from your location.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,047
Got it.

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,247
No sentries outside. If we're gonna
do this, we need to do it now.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,971
I've got north entrance,
Dig's got south. Roy...

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,122
- East.
- The roof.

27
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,691
You're on overvvatch.

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,287
The Culebras get their weapons
from the Bratva. All military grade.

29
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,403
I've got your backs.

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,085
Let's do this.

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,682
South's clear.

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,931
Nobody's home.

33
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,964
Roof's clear.

34
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,368
- North's empty too.
- Doesn't make sense.

35
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,320
They all showed up half an hour ago and
never left. They are in there somewhere.

36
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,088
Looks like somebody beat us here.

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,729
That's at least a few million dollars'
worth of heroin.

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,800
"He took Paco."

39
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,771
Whoever did this ignored the drugs...

40
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,201
...took a gang member.

41
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,361
This was personal.

42
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,923
Yeah, more than that. Whoever did this
was trying to send a message.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,286
I think I know what it is.

44
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,561
"Guilty." Well, yeah. The Culebras
are the bloodiest gang in Starling.

45
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,801
The second bloodiest?

46
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,770
Culebras have a long-standing rivalry
with the Los Halcones.

47
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,366
- You said this was personal, not business.
- And Paco?

48
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,242
There are only 86,000 Pacos in Starling.
Give or take 5000 for a few nicknames.

49
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,722
Something tells me the Culebras' rivals
will narrow that down for us.

50
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,241
We find Paco,
he'll be too dead to say anything.

51
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,404
I'm not looking for him,
I'm looking for whoever did this.

52
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,404
I will handle this. Take
the rest of the night.

53
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,331
- I'll back you up.
- Not dead on your feet, you won't.

54
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm sorry. I've been a
little out of it recently.

55
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,529
Don't be sorry, be rested. I wouldn't be
much of a teacher if I let you get killed...

56
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,206
...because your reaction
time is slow, okay?

57
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,085
Dig.

58
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,045
There are a lot of Halcones members
in Starling City.

59
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,811
How about I take the ones north
of 10th Street?

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,402
You know, we've been waiting here an hour.

61
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,291
After walking around the block five times.

62
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,568
We need to work on your patience.

63
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,728
Where is this guy, all right?

64
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,010
More importantly, how is he gonna help us
find out what this China White person is...?

65
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,525
Chien Na Wei.

66
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,651
Whatever. How is he gonna help us find out
what she's doing in Hong Kong?

67
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,247
Waller hasn't been able to locate
Chien Na Wei because she avoids using...

68
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,047
...any traceable forms of communication.
What, so he's the target now?

69
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,890
He's her delivery guy.

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,963
Her courier. But he's not a target.

71
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,767
- Waller doesn't want you to kill him.
- That's refreshing.

72
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,526
He'll use a dead drop, leave behind
information for Chien's network.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,162
- Information we'll intercept.
- I see him.

74
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,530
Stay on Bluetooth.

75
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,768
I'll be right behind.

76
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,842
What was that? Did he make you?

77
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,282
Yeah, I think he did.

78
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,326
He's gone.

79
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,323
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

80
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,323
The envelope. The message.

81
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,563
We need it. He stashed it somewhere
while you were chasing him.

82
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,402
- I didn't see him stash anything.
- Yes, you did. You just don't know it yet.

83
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,080
- That's not bad.
- It's better than "not bad."

84
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,400
What the hell was that?

85
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,087
Today's lesson. Fighting's about
being surprised and not getting rattled.

86
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,521
You look rattled.

87
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,127
- Try angry.
- Another lesson, then.

88
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,882
It's not about you getting knocked
to the mat. It's if you get up.

89
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,851
Okay, fine.

90
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,166
Then let's go again.

91
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,200
Not tonight, all right?
I gotta close up shop.

92
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,009
And you need to get some rest...

93
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,802
...let those muscles recover. Make sure you
get some protein within the hour, all right?

94
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,770
Yeah, egg whites. They're my new BFF.

95
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,126
That's disgusting.

96
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,567
No, no, no. Two blocks from here.

97
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,927
- Korean tacos.
- Korean tacos?

98
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,481
Trust me, they're heaven.

99
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,608
Come on, I'm buying.

100
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,728
- Hey, can I ask you a question?
- You just did.

101
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,769
Kidding. What?

102
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,845
- You know how to do a blood test, right?
- I know just enough to make me dangerous.

103
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,328
And, well, me holding a syringe,
well, that makes me more dangerous.

104
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,206
Why?

105
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,646
I need you to test my blood.

106
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,200
For what? And don't say STD's
because that would be crossing a line.

107
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,489
For Mirakuru.

108
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,001
I don't need to check you
for traces of Mirakuru.

109
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,686
- You were cured.
- I know, I...

110
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,562
If this is about your sleep problems, Mirakuru
makes people crazy strong and "crazy" crazy.

111
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,200
- It doesn't make it hard to get eight hours.
- Could...?

112
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,931
Are you okay?

113
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,166
I mean, besides
the whole not-sleeping thing.

114
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,206
Totally.

115
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,490
I'm fine. I'm just looking for reasons
to help me sleep, you know?

116
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,926
Okay.

117
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,968
I'm looking for a Culebra member
named Paco.

118
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,770
- Emilio?
- Paco!

119
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,684
That's what they call him, ése.

120
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,524
- Paco's his street name.
- Whose?

121
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,210
Emilio.

122
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,249
Emilio Ortega.

123
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,129
Thank you.

124
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,610
Felicity, I have a name.

125
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,410
Emilio Ortega.

126
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,961
Pinging his cell's GPS.

127
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,842
He's in the Glades, 9th and Hasen.

128
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,762
Why'd you kill all those men?

129
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,730
- What the hell are you talking about?
- What are you doing?

130
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,927
Get out of here.

131
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,606
Oh, my God.

132
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,286
- Now, Laurel.
- No.

133
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,927
Ted didn't do this.

134
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,201
Ted's been with me for the past two hours.

135
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,728
He trained with me
and then we went for dinner. And that...

136
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,122
He wasn't here when we left.

137
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,771
Okay, that is 10 minutes of my life
I am never getting back.

138
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,287
- I'm clean?
- Your cholesterol is a little high...

139
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,284
...for someone of your age
but absolutely zero Mirakuru serum.

140
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,405
Congratulations.

141
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,126
- Thank God.
- Okay.

142
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,648
You're acting like I just told you
that the biopsy came back negative.

143
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,768
What is going on?

144
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,763
It's stupid.

145
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,925
You just had me test your blood for a serum
you were cured of six months ago.

146
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,570
I already knew it was stupid.

147
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,449
The reason I haven't been sleeping...

148
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,046
...is because I've been having dreams.

149
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,362
And not normal ones.

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,049
It was like I was remembering
the time I was out, you know?

151
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,364
When Slade OD'd me on the Mirakuru?

152
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,567
What do you remember?

153
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,921
Nothing much, just a feeling.

154
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,809
A feeling of being not me.

155
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,642
Of being strong...

156
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,327
...and out of control,
but here's the thing:

157
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,167
In those dreams...

158
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,489
...I killed Sara.

159
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,564
This really had you worried.

160
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,762
Because the dreams, they didn't feel like
dreams, Felicity. They felt like memories.

161
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,881
I actually remembered
throwing arrows into her.

162
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,284
Crazy. Right?

163
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,850
Yeah.

164
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,364
Crazy.

165
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,041
So that's it?

166
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,442
I was with him the whole time.

167
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,563
You can put me on the box if you'd like.

168
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,683
If I wanted to give my daughter a polygraph, I'd
have done it back when you discovered beer.

169
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,761
So listen, what's the story
with you and this guy anyway?

170
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,127
- He's my trainer.
- Who you went to dinner with?

171
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,881
As friends. But I know him,
and he would never do something like this.

172
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,646
We gotta hold him
till the coroner's findings come back.

173
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,407
And then if they're consistent
with his story, we'll cut him loose.

174
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,762
- Well?
- Well, it's like I said, he didn't do it.

175
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,049
Why would a mass murderer
string up a body in his gym?

176
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,123
Ted caters to a pretty rough clientele.

177
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,727
A lot of career criminals, gangbangers.

178
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,763
He runs afoul of one now and again. He thinks
someone was trying to send him a message.

179
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,491
- Who?
- He says he doesn't know.

180
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,721
I wanna talk to him.

181
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,484
About this case, or me?

182
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,842
Two weeks ago,
I said I wouldn't train you to fight.

183
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,121
Now you have a trainer.

184
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,770
Who's training me to box.

185
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,806
To let off some steam. I think I have
a pretty good reason to have some.

186
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,891
- Keep your eyes open with this guy.
- He didn't do this.

187
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,961
Just the same.

188
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,961
Why are you sitting like that?

189
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,451
I'm concentrating.

190
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,647
Why?

191
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,485
- Because I need to remember something.
- Why?

192
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,327
Try this.

193
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,131
Pay attention.

194
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,767
Remember where the matching one is?

195
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,568
See? Your memory is fine.

196
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,930
He needs your help.

197
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,082
You need my help.

198
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,850
You know I don't like your friend.

199
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,647
This gaijin, he is trouble.

200
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,247
Well, I need him to remember what he saw.

201
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,927
When we capture Chien Na Wei,
my debt is paid.

202
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,001
All I care about is us getting home.

203
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,366
Then help me.

204
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,729
I love you.

205
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,723
You know that, right?

206
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,081
- Oh, come on, you must be cheating.
- I'm just better at this than you.

207
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,521
- Heh.
- AHo.

208
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,802
We're just playing a game.

209
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,720
Mr. Queen...

210
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,085
...I will house you,
feed you and clothe you...

211
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,486
...but my son is off-limits.

212
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,485
Fine.

213
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,130
Stay.

214
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,730
What are you doing?

215
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,488
I'm helping you.

216
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,087
Now, do exactly as I say.

217
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,570
Ever heard of this Ted Grant?

218
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,610
Yeah, I saw his title fight
a few years back on pay-per-view.

219
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,728
Called him Wildcat. He was the real deal.

220
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,646
The body in his gym was strung up the same
way the bodies in the warehouse were.

221
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,961
Like punching bags.

222
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,926
- What if Laurel vouches for him?
- I don't think Laurel is seeing clearly on this.

223
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,691
If Grant's our doer,
he's more than a boxer.

224
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,002
I hacked CSU's files
on the warehouse murders.

225
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,844
Culebras were armed to the teeth...

226
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,641
...but the killer, the psycho,
mass murder guy, never fired a shot.

227
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,322
- They were beaten to death by brass knuckles.
- That's a pretty specific MO.

228
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,290
Matches one murder six years ago.
Same. Culebra drug dealer.

229
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,330
Trauma consistent with brass knuckles
worn by a left-hander.

230
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,491
- Let me guess, Ted "Wildcat" Grant's a lefty.
- They called him the Starling Southpaw.

231
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,122
Well, S.C.P.D. never put that together
because Ted was never arrested.

232
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,005
He's moving.

233
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,484
You dinged him with a tracer?

234
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,723
Just because Laurel trusts him
doesn't mean I have to. Talk me in.

235
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,367
Second time I've found you with a body.

236
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,722
I've never killed anybody.

237
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,008
- I'm being set up.
- Why should I believe you?

238
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,128
Because I used to be a vigilante.

239
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,890
I used to be you.

240
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,406
The city has been hurting
long before you showed up.

241
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,084
I've never heard
of another vigilante in Starling.

242
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,685
It was six years ago.

243
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,730
I wasn't news. I stuck to the Glades.

244
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,082
And these are supposed to convince me?

245
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,720
Masks are also useful for serial killers.

246
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,242
Says the guy currently wearing one.

247
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,969
Who's that?

248
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,771
I don't know.
I've never seen him before in my life.

249
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,130
But this was hung around the body
that was found in my gym.

250
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,248
The key is to the storage locker.

251
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,169
- He's leaving me a trail to follow.
- Who is?

252
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,600
Whoever's setting me up.

253
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,047
Look, I've never killed anyone.

254
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,160
Except for that drug dealer
that you beat to death six years ago.

255
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,369
That was a mistake.
I may have avoided jail...

256
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,445
...but I have lived with the guilt of that
man's death every single day of my life.

257
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,125
I gave it all up after that.

258
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,048
I locked this place up
and I swore I'd never open it again.

259
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,129
- Who else knows about the locker?
- No one.

260
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,807
This is where I kept my supplies.
A safe place, separate from my day job.

261
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,043
- As I'm sure you've got one just like it.
- Mine's bigger.

262
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,009
Look, we're both trying to find out who the
hell's doing this. We could help each other.

263
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,969
His name's Albert Mancini.

264
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,968
No criminal record,
aside from a few unpaid parking tickets.

265
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,487
- Grant doesn't know who he is.
- You believe him.

266
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,880
I haven't decided yet.

267
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,964
Do you know
that you're training with a vigilante?

268
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,766
Former, apparently.
And, no, I didn't. I didn't.

269
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,130
So you also didn't know that six years ago
he beat someone to death?

270
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,890
How many more reasons am I gonna have to
give you before you stay away from this guy?

271
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,483
Okay, are you guys just about finished
with your little private chat?

272
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,530
The guy from your storage unit...

273
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,245
...he has no criminal record.

274
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,811
He was a magician.

275
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,167
Magician's assistant, more accurately.

276
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,370
He worked with a local act before getting
cut loose. Mancini hasn't worked since.

277
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,522
Culebra Cartel, magician's assistant.

278
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,886
What's the connection?

279
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,010
Their act was at the Zanzibar.

280
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,202
Zanzibar's where the dealer was murdered.

281
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,203
You mean the person you beat to death?

282
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,842
I told you, whoever's doing this
is leaving me a trail to follow.

283
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,247
- Then we follow it.
- We need another minute.

284
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,922
How do you two know each other?

285
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,128
We used to date.

286
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,206
You cannot be serious.

287
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,125
- I am not on your team. I don't work for you.
- Exactly.

288
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,647
- You're untrained.
- Oh. Whose fault is that?

289
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,921
Does he know what's driving you?

290
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,968
I told him that Sara's gone.

291
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,567
But does he know that you wanna follow
in her footsteps?

292
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,886
You're playing
a very dangerous game, Laurel.

293
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,447
- I can handle it.
- No, you can't.

294
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,161
Because you haven't realized
that it's not actually a game.

295
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,846
Let's go.

296
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,731
- What about Laurel?
- She's not coming.

297
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,923
- Oliver has a 2O on our killer.
- I thought Oliver was tracking Grant.

298
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,163
Looks like things changed.
Suit up, he wants us to provide backup.

299
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,084
- Roy can't go.
- What?

300
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,925
- I need to talk to you. Something important.
- It can wait.

301
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,082
No, it can't. John?

302
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,089
I'll take care of it.

303
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,761
- What the hell was that about?
- We need to talk.

304
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,001
You made that clear.

305
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,842
Before we buried Sara, I scanned her body
using portable magnetic resonance imaging.

306
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,045
- You're really starting to freak me out.
- I basically created a virtual autopsy.

307
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,282
It's not as good as a regular autopsy...

308
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,649
...but like one, I can use it to
determine things an autopsy would...

309
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,283
...like angle of attack, trajectory
and the force of the arrows.

310
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,124
Felicity, what are you saying?

311
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,965
Things about the forensics
I couldn't reconcile with.

312
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,600
Specifically,
the angle and velocity of the arrows...

313
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,651
...were not consistent with a normal bow
or archer of normal height.

314
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,691
But if the arrows were thrown
with Mirakuru force...

315
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,851
What if there was some residual Mirakuru in
your system, would explain the forensics.

316
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,650
The angle and force of the arrows.

317
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,408
- But you said I tested negative for Mirakuru.
- There isn't any in your blood today...

318
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,201
...but if one last Mirakuru episode
burned out any remnants in your system...

319
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,044
Episode?

320
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,011
You mean me killing Sara?

321
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,162
- I'm on site.
- Copy. Keep watching the perimeter.

322
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,001
- How many partners do you have, anyway?
- The Culebras, the body in your gym.

323
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,486
Body in your storage locker.

324
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,962
Someone's gone to a lot of trouble
to frame you and bring you here. Why?

325
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,130
What does all this have to do
with one killing six years ago?

326
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,681
Hello, Ted.

327
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,044
I see you got my messages.

328
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,081
Arrows.

329
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,445
Brass knuckles. I never knew why we
couldn't just use a gun the way they did.

330
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,205
We're better than they are.
At least, we're supposed to be.

331
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,567
That's almost ironic coming from you.

332
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,881
I trusted you.

333
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,884
S.C.P.D.!

334
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,601
You're under arrest
for multiple counts of homicide.

335
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,200
What are you talking about?
I didn't do this.

336
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,931
Yeah? Tell that to the stiff
we found in your locker.

337
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,566
Let's go.

338
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,370
He got past me. He knew an exit out of the
building that wasn't on the blueprints...

339
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,888
...that Felicity hooked me up with.
You had Ted Grant arrested?

340
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,965
Your father's men found him at a crime scene.
A body was found at a storage locker...

341
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,885
...that he owns, along with evidence
of past vigilantism.

342
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,485
- No. He's innocent.
- I know.

343
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,041
- I saw the person who's doing this.
- Who is it?

344
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,801
He was wearing Ted's old gear.
Full face mask. Let's go.

345
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,002
Clearly Grant knows who's behind the mask.

346
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,846
Oliver, Laurel.

347
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,843
What's up?

348
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,681
I have to...

349
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,365
Roy, don't.

350
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,205
- Let's just...
- I need to tell you something.

351
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,441
Okay.

352
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,330
L...

353
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,970
I killed Sara.

354
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,209
That doesn't...

355
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,409
You're not making any sense.

356
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,964
Why would you kill Sara?

357
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,201
It was the Mirakuru.

358
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,323
Roy had no memory of the attack.

359
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,811
No real memory, at least.

360
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,284
But he's been recalling fragments
of his Mirakuru exposure last year.

361
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,604
That, and suppressed memories
often resurface in dreams.

362
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,481
What...? This is insane.

363
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,486
Laurel, I'm so sorry.

364
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,801
- I'm really...
- Don't...

365
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,649
- Wait, Roy, where do you think you're going?
- Let him go.

366
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,451
I thought he was cured.

367
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,411
What we know about Mirakuru
is vastly outweighed...

368
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,360
...by the things we don't know.
What does that even mean?

369
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,207
That Roy killed my sister
and it's not his fault?

370
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,521
The arrows that killed Sara,
we pulled DNA off of them, didn't we?

371
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,684
I tested it against the sample of
Roy's blood. First thing I did.

372
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,524
And?

373
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,128
The results were inconclusive.

374
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,561
I can't process this right now.

375
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,161
Hey. Hey, look at me.

376
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,651
Focus on what you can process.

377
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,609
Ted knows who we're coming after.

378
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,808
I need you to find out who it is.

379
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,169
I can't. I can't. If Roy killed Sara...

380
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,567
If Roy killed Sara...

381
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,045
...then we will deal with it.

382
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,922
But right now, I need you to deal with Ted.

383
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,249
Okay?

384
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,727
Okay.

385
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,651
How sure are you?

386
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,091
There's other forensic evidence.

387
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,849
A virtual autopsy. In light of what Roy's
described, it sounds incriminating.

388
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,322
That, and his trouble sleeping
started right when Sara was killed.

389
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,643
My husband says you're having problems
remembering what you saw earlier today.

390
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,208
That's the problem.

391
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,050
I didn't see anything.

392
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,965
You see and hear far more than you think.

393
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,528
Hidden truths,
buried deep in your subconscious.

394
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,411
You saw something,
but your head is too busy.

395
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,767
You need to quiet it.

396
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,245
Close your eyes.

397
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,002
Take a deep breath.

398
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,490
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.

399
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,924
In...

400
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,650
...and out...

401
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,961
...and again.

402
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,921
You're floating in nothingness.

403
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,489
All that exists is your breath.

404
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,244
Any thoughts you have are clouds.

405
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,411
They just drift away.

406
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,889
I remember.

407
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,251
Sixteen murders.

408
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,121
Seventeen,
counting the one from six years ago.

409
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,649
That's more than Son of Sam,
less than Bundy.

410
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,804
Probably worth a miniseries, huh?
Maybe a book.

411
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,241
You became a defense attorney?

412
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,607
Can I talk to him for a minute?

413
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,162
You sure can pick them.

414
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,571
You Okay?

415
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,882
I'm not the one facing
a lifetime in prison.

416
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,286
- Who framed you?
- I don't know.

417
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,846
I can't help you
if you're gonna keep lying to me.

418
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,925
The Arrow saw you with him.
He knows you know who it is.

419
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,165
H9)'-

420
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,564
If the DA's office refuses
to seek an indictment...

421
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,404
...the police have to release you.

422
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,564
But first, I'm gonna need you
to be straight with me.

423
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,440
Who is the man behind the mask?

424
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,487
His name is Isaac Stanzler.

425
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,368
Six years ago, the Culebras ran the Glades.

426
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,365
I thought it'd be a good idea
for families to live there...

427
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,040
...without worrying
about their kids getting shot.

428
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,168
So I decided to do something about it.

429
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,924
You became a vigilante.

430
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,560
Just like your friend in the green hood.

431
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,241
Without the green hood.

432
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,640
And what about Stanzler?

433
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,444
You know the guy that Arrow's been
running around with lately? The one in red?

434
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,284
Stanzler was my guy in red.
I guess you could call him my apprentice.

435
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,247
One night, we decided to go after this drug
dealer that was pushing crank near the school.

436
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,760
We tracked him
all the way to this nightclub...

437
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,126
And what happened?

438
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,842
That drug dealer...

439
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,043
...lsaac got to him first.

440
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,811
That murder from six years ago,
that wasn't you.

441
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,166
That was him.

442
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,089
- I hung it up after that.
- And what about Stanzler?

443
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,329
What happened to Isaac Stanzler?

444
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,960
I told him to get the hell out of Starling.

445
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,242
That I never wanted
to see his face ever again.

446
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,323
I cut him loose.

447
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,204
That's why I've been lying to you
this whole time, Laurel.

448
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,245
Everything that's happening is my fault.

449
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,609
No word from Laurel?

450
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,924
Not yet. According to S.C.P.D. e-mail traffic,
which I may or may not have hacked into...

451
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,686
...they are dropping the charges
against Ted Grant.

452
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,684
Let me go after Roy.
If he's experiencing side effects...

453
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,607
...we can't leave him running around.
So you bring him in, then what?

454
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,129
Oliver, this crusade of ours,
it's supposed to be about justice, right?

455
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,523
If that's supposed to mean something,
we can't have two sets of rules.

456
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,364
One for bad guys and one for us.

457
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,966
I'm the one who brought Roy
into this crusade.

458
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,407
And maybe it's time for you
to cut him loose.

459
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,450
- Are you telling me to abandon him?
- Yes, Oliver.

460
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,241
If that's what it takes
to find justice for Sara.

461
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,088
So, what do you think
Stanzler's next move is?

462
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,801
Framing me didn't work. I'm afraid
to think of what he might try to do next.

463
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,201
What I sh0uld've done from the start.

464
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,406
After you abandoned me
the Culebra found me.

465
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,131
They wanted payback for the man they lost.

466
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,008
They tortured me for months
before I escaped.

467
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,130
Isaac, I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

468
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,249
But, come on, let's talk about this.

469
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,323
Oh, don't worry, we will.

470
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,245
There's so much I have to say
before I kill you.

471
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,127
- Where are we going?
- Just drive.

472
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,964
Hey, your beef is with me.

473
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,600
Okay, you got me. Let her go.

474
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,082
Taking innocent people hostage?
Man, I taught you better than that.

475
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,284
- They're not people, they're criminals.
- Albert Mancini wasn't.

476
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,962
You still strung him up in that nightclub.

477
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,960
You taught me that there are no innocents
when you abandoned me to the Culebras.

478
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,726
You gave me direction, purpose.

479
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,890
And then when things got tough,
when I really needed you...

480
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,246
...you weren't there.

481
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,844
It's Laurel.

482
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,606
- Put her on speaker.
- I hated you so much for that.

483
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,445
- That voice, that's him.
- I was just a kid, okay?

484
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,244
You were supposed to know better.

485
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,483
Call's coming from Laurel's cell.
Moving fast, 45 miles an hour.

486
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,926
They're in her car.

487
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,924
- They're headed north on Route 17.
- Keep that line open.

488
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,570
Isaac, I'm sorry.

489
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,846
I had no idea.

490
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,248
Eyes on the road.

491
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,526
Don't stop.

492
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,646
- Who was that, huh? Who was it?
- I don't know.

493
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,569
The only friend I ever had was you.

494
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,121
H9)'-

495
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,769
Another vigilante.

496
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,643
Looks like we started a movement.

497
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,761
Go, go, go!

498
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,560
- Get Grant.
- Get Laurel.

499
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,366
Don't you get it? He's using you.

500
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,204
You're not a human being to him.

501
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,806
You are just another weapon in his arsenal.

502
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,010
And the second you do something wrong,
he'll turn his back on you.

503
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,606
He will abandon you.

504
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,363
I'm not you.

505
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,084
Don't abandon me.

506
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,206
Never.

507
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,161
You planning on hiding
in the shadows all night?

508
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,370
That's a good trick. Used it once
or twice myself back in the day.

509
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,124
Thank you.

510
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,601
Thank me by doing something for me.

511
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,485
- Name it.
- Stay away from Laurel Lance.

512
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,531
She's in a vulnerable place,
and I don't want her getting hurt.

513
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,688
Did you bother to ask her what she wants?

514
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,286
Because that's her choice.

515
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,205
- If she stops coming, that's fine.
- She'll stop coming.

516
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,841
You know, you did me a solid, so let me
repay you with a little hard-won advice.

517
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,090
Learn from my mistake.

518
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,089
What I did, what you do...

519
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,248
...this playing judge and jUFY...

520
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,641
...it messes with people's heads.

521
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,361
It messed with Isaac's. I just waited
till it was too late to cut him loose.

522
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,163
Don't make the same mistake
with that kid you're running around with.

523
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,729
Ted, your mistake wasn't cutting him loose.

524
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,162
It was losing faith in him.

525
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,845
- Hi.
- Hi.

526
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,526
How you feeling?

527
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,766
Worst part about sobriety
is having to pass on the pain meds.

528
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,045
Right. Thought maybe
you could use a ride home.

529
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,405
And an "I told you so"?

530
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,446
I don't think that I owe you one of those.

531
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,290
When I said I wouldn't train you,
I was trying to protect you.

532
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,641
But a homicidal former vigilante apprentice
was not what I had in mind.

533
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,526
I know you were trying to protect
me, Ollie, but I'm not helpless.

534
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,322
I've never seen you that way. But, Laurel,
I'm always gonna watch out for you.

535
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,885
It's not because I think you're helpless.

536
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,404
It's because I care about you.

537
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,768
And what about Roy?

538
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,204
Do you trust me?

539
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,642
I'm gonna miss this.

540
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,686
I feel like I was just
starting to get good at it.

541
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,922
You are getting good at it.

542
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,804
That guy...

543
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,483
...he said I was just another weapon
in your arsenal.

544
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,531
Well, maybe that's what
we should call you, then.

545
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,364
Arsenal.

546
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,041
I don't know why you would ever
let me suit up after what I did.

547
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,250
It doesn't matter anyway,
because I'm gonna be turning myself in.

548
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,050
Okay.

549
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,241
There's something you need to know, Roy.

550
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,649
Something that your mind
has been trying to tell you.

551
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,848
And I think it best...

552
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,128
...if you help me let it.

553
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,530
With a candle?

554
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,646
With meditation.

555
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:23,686
To clear your thoughts, find hidden truths.

556
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,090
This is weird.

557
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,049
You're hurting.

558
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,204
But it's not for the
reasons that you think.

559
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:41,010
And I've been afraid
that if I just came out and told you...

560
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,204
...it would only make the hurt worse.

561
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,520
- Do you trust me?
- Always.

562
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,206
Good. Close your eyes.

563
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,481
And focus on your breathing.

564
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,522
In through your nose...

565
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,045
...out through your mouth.

566
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,527
In, out.

567
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,645
Floating along, weightless.

568
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,683
And the only thing that
exists is your breath.

569
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,730
Now your thoughts are like clouds.

570
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,570
They drift away.

571
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,241
Let go, Roy.

572
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,767
I killed him.

573
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,600
- The police officer. Why didn't you tell me?
- You were overdosed on Mirakuru...

574
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,445
...you didn't remember.
And I was hoping you never would.

575
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,082
But Felicity told me you had a dream
that you killed Sara and I realized...

576
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,526
It was a memory.

577
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,323
I think because of the way
Sara was murdered...

578
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,046
...the fact they used arrows...

579
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,645
...brought it to the surface.

580
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,849
- So I didn't kill Sara?
- No.

581
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,684
But I am a murderer.

582
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,287
_R0y__
No, I just need to be alone for a while.

583
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,324
This is it.

584
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,609
This is the dead drop.

585
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,928
What kind of a message is this?

586
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,047
Have you ever heard of steganography?

587
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,249
Is that the dinosaur
with the plates on its back?

588
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,810
It's the art of concealing a message
within another message.

589
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,241
In this case...

590
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,971
...within an image.

591
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,761
"Li Kuan Hui."

592
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,888
- Who's that?
- I do not know.

593
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,241
But if Chien Na Wei is interested in him,
so are we.

594
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,041
Hey, it worked.

595
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,521
- Thank you.
- I don't want your gratitude.

596
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,207
There's only one thing I want from you.

597
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,806
Name it.

598
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,442
Get out of our lives as soon as possible.

599
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,603
Sign says closed. Learn to read.

600
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,286
I thought you might make an exception.

601
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,849
Yeah? And why would I do that?

602
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,688
Because I just made sure your past vigilantism
fell under the statute of limitations.

603
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,251
No new charges will be filed.

604
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,042
Much obliged.
But you still shouldn't be here.

605
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,406
No, this is exactly where I should be.

606
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,326
Last night, when Isaac had me at gunpoint,
when he was shooting at my friends...

607
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,484
...I should have been so scared.

608
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,165
Rattled.

609
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,324
But I wasn't.

610
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,331
I saw what needed to be done, and I did it.

611
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,686
Because you taught me.

612
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,611
I've just been teaching you
how to throw a proper jab.

613
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,889
And your pal Robin Hood
doesn't want me even doing that.

614
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,684
I want you to give me the tools
to avenge my sister's death.

615
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,367
I want you to teach me
to get justice outside of a courtroom.

616
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,568
I took on an apprentice once...

617
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,451
...didn't work out so good.
Well, it's like you said...

618
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,251
...it's not about how you get
knocked down to the mat.

619
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,129
It's about whether you get up.

620
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,167
- Yaah!
- Uhn!

621
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,610
Who the hell are you?

622
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,609
I'm Cupid, stupid.
