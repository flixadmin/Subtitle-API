1
00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:03,253
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow..."

2
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:04,421
Come with us.
The choice is yours.

3
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:06,423
What's next for you, love?

4
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:09,009
I guess I'll give life
above ground a fair shot.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,386
Aha.

6
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,929
Finally.

7
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,472
I think this is the end
of the line for me.

8
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,766
- Ah, get in here.
- Aww.

9
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,018
Whoo.

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,787
- Piss off, you bloody guv'nor!

11
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,487
Punks, can't handle
their liquor.

12
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,660
- Is that the ocean?
- No.

13
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,162
And you look like garbage.

14
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,331
- I feel like garbage.

15
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,041
Why don't you, huh?

16
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,667
Where the hell were you
last night?

17
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,252
- I dropped Lita off
at her mom's.

18
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,629
- Oh.

19
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,465
Well, aren't you just
a good dad, huh?

20
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,966
Ow.

21
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,927
Hey.

22
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,304
How come nobody tucked me
into bed, huh?

23
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,181
- You're asking me?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,101
Where's Sara?
- Don't know.

25
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,645
- Oh.

26
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,605
What do you--
Gideon, where's Sara?

27
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,191
- Sara Lance is not on board
the Waverider.

28
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,236
- Sara's missing?

29
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,654
Everyone's missing.

30
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,448
Gideon, who is on board?

31
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,493
- Ava Sharpe, Mick Rory,
and several punks.

32
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,370
- Uh, where could they be?

33
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,913
- Skyemont.

34
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,541
- Why do you say that?
- It's on your hand.

35
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,837
Mick, you're a genius.

36
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,171
Maybe it's from Sara.
Let's go.

37
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,761
Oh, God. Okay.
No, no, no, no, no.

38
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,237
- London, 1977.

39
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:38,116
The tangled knot of grime,
the stodgy monarchy.

40
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,577
This collision of punk rock
and aristocracy

41
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,663
slamming into each other
like two doomed worlds, this--

42
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,207
- This is a lot at 7:00 a.m.,
John.

43
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,836
I'm glad you're
in a good mood though.

44
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,212
- Well, why shouldn't I be?

45
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,132
You see, my soul
finally belongs to me.

46
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,633
Astra is redeemed,

47
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,428
and--

48
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,431
I get to wake up next to you,
you lovely creature.

49
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,515
- Mm.

50
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,809
- How are you feeling?

51
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,229
- I think a no-strings-attached
hookup every now and then

52
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,273
is good for the soul.

53
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,025
- Even if it's with a guy
whose only coat

54
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,776
smells like booze
and cigarettes.

55
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,697
- Ugh.
Oh, hel-lo.

56
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,240
- Oh.
Sorry, guys.

57
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,950
You, uh, missed the party.

58
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,285
- Wait, are you two--

59
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,078
- Yeah.
- Uh-oh.

60
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,374
Okay, sorry.
I'm not judging, I just--

61
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,918
it's none of my business.
I'm fine.

62
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,338
It's an involuntary reaction.

63
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,505
- We should burn the room.

64
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,673
- Hey, at least we know

65
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,217
how to use protection, Pops.

66
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,178
Do either of you know
where Sara is?

67
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,722
- Uh, we seem to have
lost track of her.

68
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,601
- Oh.
Someone did hand me this.

69
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,853
Is this anything?

70
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,482
- I call.

71
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,280
- Full house, fellas.

72
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,865
- That's three in a row.

73
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,368
She's a shady card sharp.

74
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,536
- Oh, no.
Just lucky.

75
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,375
What about now?

76
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,091
- Still lucky
and now also richer.

77
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:25,056
I just love toying
with these poor mortals.

78
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,976
- Oh, yeah, well you are one of
these poor mortals now, love.

79
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,394
Try remembering that
the next time

80
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,687
you come across one
with a gun, yeah?

81
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,438
- Astra, have you seen Sara?

82
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,941
- Uh, not recently.
Maybe ask Behrad.

83
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,734
- Yeah, where is my brother?

84
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,404
- I can't believe how much
we have in common.

85
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,739
It's like we're riding
the same cosmic vibe, you know?

86
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,491
We just click.

87
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,911
It's like we were destined
to connect in this moment.

88
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,288
- Hey, wrap it up Behrad.

89
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,914
- We gonna pick this up later.

90
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,457
Cheerio.

91
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,042
- Hey.
Have you seen Sara?

92
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,168
- No.
- Ugh!

93
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,336
- Maybe she's with Nate.

94
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,796
He was headed back to the club.

95
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,339
- Back?
Why?

96
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,508
- We met Starman
at the after-after.

97
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,343
Said he had to prep
for his show there tonight.

98
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,304
- What the hell's a Starman?

99
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,472
- Major T?

100
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,017
Ziggy Stardust?

101
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,184
- Bowie!

102
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,478
He's talking about David Bowie.

103
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,150
- See, my girlfriend's
from another time.

104
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,484
- Oh, like the future.

105
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,028
- No.
Well...

106
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,155
technically, yes,
but she's from the future

107
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,949
with a different
timeline entirely.

108
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,035
Now she lives in a Totem.

109
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,955
And I'm forced
to be at peace with it.

110
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,374
- What's her name?

111
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,251
- Zari.

112
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,504
Her name is Zari.

113
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,591
And I'm afraid I'm never
gonna see her again.

114
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,302
Hi, Zari.

115
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,720
Hey, guys.
This is David Bowie.

116
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,180
- Marvelous.

117
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,222
- Okay, Nate.
We're looking for Sara.

118
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,766
Is she here with you?

119
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,560
- Last time I saw her
was at the concert.

120
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,561

125
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,864
Sara disappeared.
Is he singing about Sara?

126
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,116
- Deh, deh, deh--do not
interrupt David's process.

127
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,911
He's trying to cheer me up
by singing a song about Zari.

00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,766
Is that song you're singing

about Sara Lance?

00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,112
- Isn't it wild?

147
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,988
- So you saw this
with your own

148
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,367
beautiful, asymmetrical eyes?

149
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,121

See for yourself.

151

00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,229
You're a Smell fan?
- They're something else.

158
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,356

I gotta--I gotta let you in

- Whoa.

165
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,432
She's a space girl.

166
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,810
- Ava--
- Okay.

167
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,855
Um, Sara's been abducted so,

168
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,524
uh, Sara's been abducted.

169
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,860
Uh...I'll be right back.

170
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,699
- So she's a mess.

171
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,659
- All right, so let's just
give her some space.

172
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,995
In the meantime,
what do we know about aliens?

173
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,288
- Literally nothing.

174
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,539
- They're green.

175
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,999
- Listen, you fools.

176
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,375
Sara's missing

177
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,169
because you guys
were partying last night.

178
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,172
We have to find her.
We're running out of time.

179
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,326
- Time to get organized.

180
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,162
- Ava, you're back.
- Mm-hmm.

181
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,622
- Oh.
Whoa.

182
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,915
- Here you go.

183
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,083
- Girl, are you okay?
- What?

184
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,751
I'm fine.
Why?

185
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,128
- Well, we just thought that--

186
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,629
- You know,
with Sara being lost,

187
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,172
you may wanna sit this one out.

188
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,717
- Uh, she is not lost.
She is pre-found.

189
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,510
There's a solution to every
problem including this one.

190
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,470
- Wow, indexed.
Thorough.

191
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,055
- You are all
the best of the best.

192
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,182
If we handle this logically
and rationally,

193
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,684
we will get Sara back, okay?

194
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,936
- Right, well, uh,
this a waste of time.

195
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,980
I've got a better idea.
- Oh?

196
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,857
- Yeah, ever since
I rescued her from Purgatory,

197
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,359
Sara and I have
a psychic connection.

198
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,861
It'll allow me to locate her,

199
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,237
and everything I need
is at the mansion.

200
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,864
- Damn it, John.
That's insubordinate.

201
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,199
But I won't try to stop you.

202
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,868
- You know, he's actually
most effective

203
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,286
not left to his own devices.

204
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,954
I can just--
- Thank you, Z.

205
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,914
- We're gonna fix this.
- Mm-hmm.

206
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,336
Astra, would you mind keeping
them on mission please?

207
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:32,006
- Uh, I'm not really
on the team, so...

208
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,466
- We're accepting outside help.
Thank you.

209
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,055
- Okay. I think I need
to just calm down

210
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,848
and do some "research."

211
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,891
- Really?
Right now?

212
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,059
Dude, Sara needs us!

213
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,435
- I'm freaking out here, man.

214
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,896
- Aw, come on, B.

215
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,439
Ah, Mick.
Perfect timing.

216
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,149
I need you to check
on any leads you may have

217
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,317
in the underworld please.

218
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,693
- Not gonna work.

219
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,695
This whole thing's
not gonna work.

220
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,656
Nothing works without Sara.

221
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,324
- Okay, so what?
Are you just gonna drink?

222
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,784
That's real mature, Rory.

223
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,119
Real mature.

224
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,329
- Wow. You really got this team
figured out.

225
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,997
- Mm-hmm.
- So what do we do?

226
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,707
- Uh, we are gonna call
the experts, the D.E.O.

227
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,293
- Good idea. Eesh--
- What?

228
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,504
- Is it gonna get weird
between you and Alex Danvers

229
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,422
'cause she and Sara
had a fling?

230
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,592
- It's--swing a dead cat.
Sara never liked to be alone.

231
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,208
- Are you okay?

232
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,255
Whoa.

233
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,715
Who are you?

234
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,676
- I'm Spartacus,
the Undefeatable.

235
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,970
- Oh.
Yeah, that "undefeatable" part

236
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,722
didn't quite stick, but...

237
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,560
Uh, wait.

238
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,186
Hey, get back here!

239
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,081
- Sorry.
Did you find Sara?

240
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,333
- No.

241
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,294
Care to wet your whistle?

242
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,755
- I'm confused.
What did you learn?

243
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,132
That Sara Lance is

244
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,633
far beyond my reach.

245
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,136
- You told Ava
you could reach her.

246
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,013
- Yeah, well, I overpromised.

247
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,848
- You can't just give up
on Sara.

248
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,600
There's got to be
something you can do.

249
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,018
- Come on. Anything?
- Look--

250
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,812
aliens took her, all right?
To space.

251
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,690
This is really not my area
of expertise.

252
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,192
Now if it was a ghost,
or a demon,

253
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,735
or even a handle of whiskey,

254
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,488
I could help you out
with that, but I'm sorry.

255
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,032
All right?
I'm an astrologer.

256
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:06,118
And you need an astronomer.

257
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,661
- What an ass.

258
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,372
- Yeah, he does have
that going for him.

259
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,208
- Look, he's right.

260
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,959
This is out of his league.

261
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,878
This is out of all our leagues.

262
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,214
- I disagree.

263
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,342
Astra, let's talk
about your "network."

264
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,844
My network?

265
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,138
I've been on Earth
for, like, five minutes.

266
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,973
- Exactly.

267
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,688
- Gideon, why isn't
the D.E.O. answering?

268
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,607
- The Department
of Extranormal Operations

269
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,610
was destroyed in the infamous
year 2020 by Rama Khan.

270
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,446
- Nate, this is a huge setback.

271
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,698
We needed the D.E.O.
Aliens is their jurisdiction.

272
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,325
Yeah.

273
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,910
- Captain Sharpe,
I believe we are dealing

274
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,453
with a temporal anomaly.

275
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,996
According to
the original timeline,

276
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,331
there was no alien spacecraft

277
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,166
over London in 1977.

278
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,127
- Meaning this is
our jurisdiction.

279
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,296
- Huh?
- We're the experts.

280
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,422
No.

281
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,341
We're--we're the experts?

282
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,425
- Damn right we are.

283
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,177
You, me, the Legends.

284
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,554
We're the only people
who are capable

285
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,472
of handling
time-traveling aliens.

286
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,307
- Nate, if I trusted the team,

287
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,518
I wouldn't have made an entire
binder to get rid of them.

288
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,812
Okay?
The D.E.O. was plan A.

289
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,356
Well, Ava, you are now
in charge of the Legends.

290
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,441
So welcome to plan B.

291
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,734
Now breathe it in.

292
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,735
Breathe with me.
- No.

293
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,736
- Come.

294
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,073
- Plan B smells like pot.

295
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,491
- I got something.

296
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,118
- You are a walking
contact high.

297
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,954
- You're welcome.
Gideon, put this up.

298
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,081
- That's a cute little kid.

299
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,374
- B, that's a tabloid.

300
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,959
- Yes, tabloids
help me not think

301
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,669
about how we live
on a technological terror

302
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,838
hurtling through
a swirling green nightmare.

303
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,339
- Damn.

304
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,884
- So this girl,
Esperanza Cruz,

305
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,761
says that she was abducted
by aliens,

306
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,472
and from then on, she could
communicate with them.

307
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,516
They implanted something
in her head.

308
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,018
- B!

309
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,686
I'm s--this is a tabloid, okay?

310
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,146
From how--what, 20 years ago?

311
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,564
It's probably
totally fabricated.

312
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,816
I need real leads.
- She's real, man.

313
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,569
Gideon located her.
- I mean...

314
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,237
little kid
with alien tech in her head.

315
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,405
Not a bad lead.

316
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,574
- Okay, sure.
Fine.

317
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,659
You know? Whatever.
It's all we've got.

318
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,494
I mean, Rory's probably
good and boozed up by now,

319
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,996
so why don't you take Micky

320
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,706
and go investigate
this Esperanza--

321
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,458
what is her last name?
- Uh, Cruz.

322
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,376
Are we really sure bringing
Mick to talk to a kid

323
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,754
is, like, best practices?
- No, n--

324
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,631
You're gonna go see her
present day.

325
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,299
Some of us are still trying
not to mess with the timeline.

326
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,593
- Right.
The timeline.

327
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,511
Aye-aye.

328
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,180
- You're excused.

329
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,640
Ugh!

330
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,899
- What is it?
- I was confined to one

331
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,275
of these glass prisons.

332
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,735
You were as well.

333
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,654
Which means there
are also others inside.

334
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,156
- You just figured
that out now?

335
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,240
- I did.

336
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,700
I also commanded an army

337
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,619
of 120,000 slaves,
gladiators, and peasants

338
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,037
against the Roman republic.

339
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,122
- Yeah, I've heard.
- Mm, excellent.

340
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,874
Then we'll liberate
our fellow prisoners

341
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,834
and we'll lead a rebellion
against our captors.

342
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,670
- Wait, no.
We don't know who's in there.

343
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,424
- Rise, compatriot.

344
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,511
I am your savior.
I am Spartacus!

345
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,023
- What, pray tell, are you?

346
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,984
A Saxon?

347
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,152
- Nope, that's definitely
an alien.

348
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,176
Hey, a little help here!

349
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,995
- The thrill of the battle.

350
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,080
Reminds me of being back
in the Colosseum.

351
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,708
- Yeah, you just stand there
in the Colosseum too?

352
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,960
- I was letting it
tire itself out.

353
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,879
If it had slain you,
I would've been well-rested

354
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,380
and easily avenged your death.

355
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,802
- Being an avenger is stupid.

356
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,346
The goal is to prevent death.
I am a Preventer.

357
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,974
You wanna join the Preventers,
Sparty?

358
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,060
- Yeah--yes?

359
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,561
- Good choice.

360
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,980
Now stop opening pods.

361
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,566
We're gonna go find
who's flying the ship,

362
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,402
and we're gonna prevent them
from breathing.

363
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,534
- I'm telling you.

364
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,912
Sara ain't here.
It's a waste of our time.

365
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,830
- We're gonna find Sara.

366
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,333
The fact that we found
this person is a sign.

367
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,585
And when the universe
shows you a sign,

368
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,961
you should believe it.

369
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,379
- Is that right?

370
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,466
The universe exists
for one reason.

371
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,009
To kill you.

372
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,809
Hello.
Miss Cruz?

373
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,269
Ma'am?

374
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,604
Hm.
Must not be home.

375
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,324
- Let's not tell Miss Cruz
we broke in.

376
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:08,105
- When they split up, we'll
take them out one by one.

377
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,439
- Nonsense.

378
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,024
We have the element
of surprise.

379
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,317
We attack both savages now,

380
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,694
and we slay them
in one fell swoop.

381
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,445
- We have no idea
what they're capable of.

382
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,822
Look, I was an assassin.

383
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,575
Rule number one:
isolate your targets.

384
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,618
- Do not fight
from the shadows.

385
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,246
I commanded an undefeated army
of 120,000 warriors.

386
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,166
- Well, I assure you
they are all dead now.

387
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,584
- Then I must avenge them.

388
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,793
- No, no avenging.
No avenging.

389
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,878
It's preventing!

390
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,504
- Prepare to die, savages!

391
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,333
- I am very, very sorry, David,
you're under pressure.

392
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,169
Look, maybe I can help you.

393
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,466
Ooh, whoa, whoa.

394
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,801
Why would you do that?
- Astra has a lead.

395
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,345
- Okay.

396
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,846
All right.
She has a lead.

397
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,848
Go ahead.

398
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,226
- So I heard about this guy
who was once in hell.

399
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,810
Raved about aliens.

400
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,562
His name was Aleister Crowley.

401
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,564
Aleister bloody Crowley.

402
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,149
Come off it.
Crowley's a kook.

403
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,442
- That is
the conventional wisdom.

404
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,236
But he had this tome of secrets

405
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,487
called the "Book of the Law."

406
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,655
- In it, Crowley detailed

407
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,406
these alien encounters

408
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,533
and spells that
these aliens taught him.

409
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,369
But he disappeared from hell.

410
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,747
Maybe he used these
alien spells to escape.

411
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,582
- Yeah.
Crowley didn't escape.

412
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,167
All right?

413
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,212
I summoned him, and then
I trapped him on Earth.

414
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,881
- You trapped--sorry--
isn't that a felony?

415
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,549
- No.

416
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,885
But like most things I do,
it probably should be.

417
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,263
So, what'd
you do with the book, John?

418
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,639
- All right, okay.

419
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,099
Being as we don't have
any other ideas,

420
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,185
I kept it safe right over...

421
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,189
Gary!

422
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,734
What'd I tell you
about nicking my things, eh?

423
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,586
- Why did you kidnap me?

424
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,255
- Gary!

425
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,048
Gary!

426
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,260
Bloody hell Gary
would be reading Crowley,

427
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,263
I have no idea.
There it is.

428
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,973
- Find it?

429
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,394
- What the hell is that?

430
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,812
- Ew.

431
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:02,946
- You better help me
understand you,

432
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,406
or this is gonna end quick.

433
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,659
- Hey!
Hands where I can see them.

434
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,924
Gary?

435
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,844
- Please don't be mad.

436
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,388
- If she could talk
to aliens,

437
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,807
why would she live
in a redneck dump like this?

438
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,185
- Maybe you're right.
But isn't it worth making sure?

439
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,771
Besides,
Ava really needs a win.

440
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:40,192
- I don't need a win.
We all need a win.

441
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,861
This isn't about me.
Oh, my God.

442
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,322
Don't give me that look.
- What look?

443
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,782
- You know exactly what look.

444
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,450
- "You'll feel better
not bottling up

445
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,951
your emotions" look?
- I'm not bottling them up.

446
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,370
I just don't wanna talk
about them.

447
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,205
- Okay.

448
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,374
I'm just gonna say one thing.
- Nate.

449
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,085
- You have not mentioned
Sara's proposal once.

450
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,045
- I am setting aside
my feelings

451
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,005
to focus on the goal
of getting Sara back.

452
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,465
Okay?
You should too.

453
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,052
- I wonder what's in there.

454
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,929
- Let me guess.

455
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,390
More dumb redneck stuff.

456
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,029
Guess she's not such
a dumb redneck after all.

457
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,373
- Guess not.

458
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,383
- Behrad, Mick, answer me.

459
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,843
Great.
Two more abductions.

460
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,219
This is why we don't talk

461
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,804
about emotions
during the mission.

462
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,347
- Okay, Gideon's scanning
for heat signatures.

463
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,557
It's--it's gonna be okay.

464
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,683
- Okay?
- Yeah.

465
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,017
- Three Legends are missing.

466
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,519
Things are pretty far
from okay.

467
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,020
- Yeah, well they just
got further, love.

468
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,481
We found something
in Gary's room.

469
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,900
- A human-sized chrysalis.

470
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,318
- Guys, we don't understand.

471
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,446
- Gary is an alien.

472
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,781
- An alien?
Oh, my--

473
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:10,991
Okay.
I don't buy it.

474
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,494
- Well, we also found these.

475
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,954
- Gary's glasses?

476
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,291
- Oh, allow me to demonstrate.

477
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,710
And brace yourselves.

478
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,048
- No.

479
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,971
Gary abducted Sara.

480
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,978
- I was sent to Earth to kidnap
the quintessential human.

481
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,104
- Spartacus?

482
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,316
- Oh, no, no, no.
You!

483
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,109
Spartacus was just
my boss's lunch.

484
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,528
But don't worry.
I don't eat humans.

485
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,363
Anymore.

486
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,741
- Terrific.

487
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,659
- The point is, I couldn't go
through with your abduction

488
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,203
because I fell
in love with you,

489
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,663
with Ava, with all humans.

490
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,831
- Yeah, well that's funny
because I still feel

491
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,374
very abducted, Gary.

492
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,543
- Well, my boss, Kayla,
found us.

493
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,712
But I remained loyal.
That's why I saved you.

494
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,256
- You saved me?
- Yeah!

495
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,842
I rigged the pod to open
with your handprint.

496
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,636
- Okay--Gary,
where are we going?

497
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,305
- No clue.
Kayla doesn't trust me anymore.

498
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,848
I don't blame her.

499
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,935
- Yeah, well, you and I
are also not okay.

500
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,394
Do you have any idea
how wrecked

501
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,271
Ava must feel right now?

502
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,649
I mean, yeah, I'm sure she's
pretending to keep it together

503
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,651
for everyone else's sake,
but inside,

504
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,195
she must be dying.
- Stop, stop!

505
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,114
It's torture to even think
about what Ava's going through.

506
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,618
Do me in.
I deserve it.

507
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,204
I've destroyed the very thing
I most stan.

508
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,082
- Knock it off.
You're gonna help me get home.

509
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,626
Now tell me everything
that you know about this ship.

510
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,671
Well...

511
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,965
when you first met,
you butt heads.

512
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,300
But any fool could tell you two
were meant for each other.

513
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,011
- This spaceship, Gary.

514
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,222
- Oh.

515
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,773
What the--what the--hey!

516
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,233
Ava?

517
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,235
Nate?
- Behrad, are you guys okay?

518
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,821
- Yeah, it is very far
from chill in here.

519
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,781
- 2100 hours.

520
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,409
Trespassers have
regained consciousness.

521
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,578
They were armed
with some fancy weapons.

522
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,745
Not sure why.

523
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,706
Only one way to find out.

524
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,003
- I told you the universe
was trying to kill us.

525
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,504
- What was that, old timer?

526
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,048
- I wasn't talking to you,
Miss Crazy.

527
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,719
- I don't like
being called that.

528
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,761
- He didn't mean that,
Miss Cruz.

529
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:37,846
- Spooner.

530
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,097
I go by Spooner now.

531
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,849
- Okay, Spooner, ma'am.

532
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,102
This is all just
a misunderstanding.

533
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,021
The alien communicator
in your head,

534
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,023
we need you to use it
to find our friend.

535
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:51,067
- So y'all's plan was not only
to break onto my property,

536
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,611
but to kidnap me?

537
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,572
- We were gonna ask.
In fact, we still are.

538
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,198
- What?
- Shh.

539
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,783
Will you come with us?

540
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,660
- Come with you?

541
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,829
Oh, but you ain't going.

542
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,753
- Please hurry.

543
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,004
She's getting real friendly

544
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,297
with her knife.

545
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,593
- Who you talking to?

546
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,678
- Uh, he's a schizophrenic.

547
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,764
He talks to himself.
- It's true.

548
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,058
It's a nervous tick actually.

549
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,645
Uh--could--could--hey.

550
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,438
Wait.
Hey, hey, hey--hey.

551
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,190
Wait, wait.
Hey, hey!

552
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,150
No!

553
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,777
- Behrad?
What's happening?

554
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:40,075
- Uh, the universe
ripped his comms out.

555
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,829
- Captain Sharpe, I've
pinpointed their location.

556
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,289
- Oh, thank God.

557
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,957
I'm not losing
any more Legends today.

558
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,086
Gideon, take the ship
to that location.

559
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,004
- A ship?

560
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,632
Nate, you're with me.

561
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,550
Wait, hang on.
Why is my voice echoing?

562
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,010
- She hacked my comms.

563
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,804
She can hear everything
you're saying.

564
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,655
- That thing
against the Waverider?

565
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,033
- Whoa!

566
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,869
- Touché, Spooner.

567
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:32,127
- Please stop shooting my ship.

568
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,295
- Don't come any closer.

569
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,506
I ain't gon' let y'all
abduct me again.

570
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,800
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on.

571
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,553
That's what you think this is?
You think we're aliens?

572
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:44,055
- The hell else could you be?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

573
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,267
We're time travelers.
- Time travelers?

574
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,436
- Yes!
That's our time ship.

575
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,188
Which is also a spaceship,
but that's beside the point.

576
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,649
Look, I'm sorry
that we trespassed, okay?

577
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,067
It was wrong.

578
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,318
But--

579
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,778
We're desperate.

580
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,864
Listen.

581
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:05,034
The woman I love was abducted
by aliens last night.

582
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,246
And I just found that
she's gonna propose to me.

583
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,168
I will do anything

584
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,463
if you can find her.

585
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,715
Will you please help me?

586
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,053
- Exactly what an alien
would say.

587
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,096
Just--

588
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,810
- Now can I burn
this place down?

589
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,359
- Can we go over the plan
one more time?

590
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:39,736
Because it still feels
slightly suicidal.

591
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,112
- Well, we don't have
enough fuel

592
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,489
to turn around and go home,
right?

593
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,199
- Uh-huh.
- So we commandeer the ship.

594
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,992
- From Kayla,
my vicious, violent,

595
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,786
and very vindictive boss.

596
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,246
- Then we open a wormhole back
to Earth's temporal zone.

597
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,873
- An unstable rip
in spacetime itself.

598
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,374
- And then we fly the ship
through it.

599
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,043
- On whatever fumes remain

600
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,336
after we burn everything

601
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,712
opening the wormhole.

602
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,380
- Well then,
we better get moving.

603
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:02,008
First things, you gotta go
get rid of your boss.

604
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,094
- Right.
Okay.

605
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:09,015
Here goes nothing.

606
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:12,477
- Gary, your glasses.

607
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,937
- Whoops.

608
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,484
All right.
Guess we'll do it this way.

609
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,701
- Okay.
Wormhole time.

610
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,610
- Morning, sunshine.

611
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,405
- Tables may have turned,

612
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,990
but I ain't going down
without a fight.

613
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,450
- Whoa.
We're not gonna hurt you.

614
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,118
- Look.

615
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,998
- Where the hell am I?

616
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,584
- Like Ava said before,
we're time travelers.

617
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,920
This is our time ship.
- Admit it.

618
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,005
You're only being nice so
I'll help you find your friend.

619
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,424
- 100%.
Yes.

620
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,844
- Even if I wanted
to help y'all, I can't.

621
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,804
- Why not?

622
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,932
- This thing in my head
is like an antenna.

623
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,725
If I send a signal
to your friend,

624
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,226
the aliens who put it there
could find me.

625
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,187
- Look, we have the technology

626
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,563
to remove whatever's
in your head

627
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,317
if--if you help us find Sara.

628
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,444
- How is my signal
gonna locate her?

629
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,196
- It doesn't have to.

630
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,156
Our friend will direct it
to the aliens that she's with.

631
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,950
- Oh!
- If you think we're weird,

632
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,493
wait till you meet John.

633
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,957
- So I send out my signal
and connect to this alien guy.

634
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,625
- His name is Gary.

635
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,461
- He's an alien named Gary?
- Gary Green.

636
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,588
- Ah, Green.
Yeah, now it makes sense.

637
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,966
- Once you make the connection,
I'll step into that Sigil

638
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,342
then Astral Project myself

639
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,636
to Gary's location.

640
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,596
And then I'll look for Sara.
- Right.

641
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,056
And how do I connect

642
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,641
to this Gary alien
who I've never met?

643
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,143
- You'll drink a potion
of sorts.

644
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,562
- One delish smoothie
coming at you.

645
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,106
- Good luck.
- Crowley's spell requires you

646
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,482
to ingest something of Gary's.

647
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,567
The chrysalis
is all we've got.

648
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,695
- Seriously?
- No, she's not gonna--

649
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,154
- The sooner this is over,

650
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,823
the sooner
this thing's out of my head.

651
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,157
But I hope it works.

652
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,951
Salud.

653
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,369
- Oh, God.
- Oh.

654
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,704
- Oh.
- Oh.

655
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,081
- She did it.

656
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,250
- Eh.
Kinda tangy.

657
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,921
All right, um, ready?

658
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,259
Yeah, after my abduction,
I started wearing tinfoil hats.

659
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,927
It blocked any alien signals
I could pick up.

660
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,679
- Huh. Nifty.
Right.

661
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,305
On with the show.

662
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,287
- I can feel him.

663
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,749
I found the alien.

664
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,459
A lot dweebier than I thought.

665
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,295
- Bloody Crowley was right.
- I can sense him.

666
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:10,173
He's worried and wants
to come down to Earth.

667
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,008
It looks like he's trying
to help Sara.

668
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,093
- Oh, I just need
to step into the Sigil

669
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,261
and find her.

670
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,097
John, are you okay?

671
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,224
Spooner's connection
is unstable.

672
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,893
I'm giving it everything
just to maintain it.

673
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,311
- I'll do it.
- No, whoa, whoa.

674
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,479
Are you crazy?
You'll kill yourself.

675
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,897
Look what's happening to John.

676
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,440
- It's plan B, Nate.
Embrace it.

677
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,161
- Sara?

678
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,462
- Ava.

679
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,589
Wait, how...

680
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,257
How are you...

681
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,842
Are you here?

682
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,094
- Hey, hey, hey.
Stay with me.

683
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:59,013
Look at me.

684
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,016
Yes.

685
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,935
- Yes, what?

686
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:07,897
- When you get home,
I'll marry you.

687
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,275
So you better get home, okay?

688
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:18,157
I love you.

689
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,370
- He's killing himself.

690
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,705
We have to stop him.

691
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,259
- John.
Look at me.

692
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,272
- Round two.

693
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,658
- Wormhole's open, Sara!

694
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,555
Whoa!

695
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,057
- No, no!

696
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,439
Once again, I wake
to Zari Tarazi.

697
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,941
- Oh, you're up?

698
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,360
- I almost died.

699
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,778
But you saved me.

700
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,321
- Yeah, well I couldn't
let you die

701
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,366
right after getting
your soul back, so...

702
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,662
- Gidget said you
might be dehydrated,

703
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,580
so I made you a green smoothie
to help you recover.

704
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,291
Sans alien cocoon.

705
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,126
- Oh, cheers.

706
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,044
Mmm.

707
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,337
Yep.

708
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,007
It's very tasty.

709
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:24,635
- Hey, uh, let me know when
you have your strength back.

710
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,938
It's a fling.

711
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,690
- Uh-huh.

712
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,527
You know I can tell
when someone's bluffing, right?

713
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,362
It looks like Crowley wasn't.

714
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,656
- Yeah, well,
even if alien magic is real,

715
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,325
Crowley is a slippery fish.

716
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,743
He's not to be trusted.

717
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:51,912
- Hm.
Whatever you say, roomie.

718
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,957
- Hey, that was a short
residence on the Waverider, eh?

719
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,586
- Yeah, I can't keep getting
roped into Legends missions.

720
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,004
Let's just say
I'm not as enamored

721
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,381
of the timeline
as everyone else.

722
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,175
It's like you said,

723
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,677
I'm mortal now.

724
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,931
I wanna see what it's like
to be...normal.

725
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,559
Maybe I can love this world
like the rest of you do.

726
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,395
- You've come a long way,
you little Hellspawn.

727
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,025
- And come on, John.

728
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,735
Just a fling?

729
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:26,155
She's got you
on a juice cleanse.

730
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,208
- Sure you won't stick around?

731
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,168
You've got a pretty chill vibe

732
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,420
beneath your gun-toting
outcast vibe.

733
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,464
- Look, we contacted
your friend,

734
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,508
and I'm sorry
she's not back yet.

735
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,926
But I want this thing removed

736
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,511
so I can finally live
a normal life.

737
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,012
- I get that.

738
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,515
You wanna keep it zen
in the brain stem.

739
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,976
Dr. Gideon will fix you up.

740
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,606
What do you see, Gideon?

741
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,027
- Nothing out of the ordinary.

742
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,904
- Really?
Can you look closer?

743
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,864
- If I removed and thoroughly
dissected her brain,

744
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,825
we might something
the scan did not detect.

745
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,576
May I proceed?

746
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,953
- What's going on out there?

747
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,746
- No.
Don't kill her, Gideon.

748
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,373
- Yeah, I can hear it.

749
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,707
- I wasn't gonna let her--

750
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,918
- You can't hear it, can you?

751
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,465
They're all around us.

752
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,513
- I've never seen
anything like this

753
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,806
in a temporal zone.

754
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,058
- Aliens.
Lots of 'em.

755
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,144
- They're falling
into the timeline.

756
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,489
- Why are you smiling?

757
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,949
We gotta clean this mess up.

758
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,492
- I know.

759
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,994
It's just that the only person

760
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,663
who could create
this much mayhem is Sara

761
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,498
which means she's alive.

762
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,209
- Well, if the universe
shows you a sign,

763
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,378
you should believe it.

764
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,630
- Mm!

765
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,052
- Engaged?

766
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,638
I'm so happy I could cry.
- Gary, if we don't get

767
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,432
through that wormhole,
we are stuck here.

768
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,185
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- I'm sorry.

769
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,437
I'm not as good a pilot
as my fiancé.

770
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,565
- Wait, you and that
other alien are engaged?

771
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,443
- Her name's Kayla, but yeah.
I assume the wedding's off now.

772
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,320
Did I not mention that?
- We can talk about this later.

773
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,863
Right now, just get us
through that wormhole.

774
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,531
Yeah.

775
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,368
- We're gonna make it.

776
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,412
- We're not gonna make it.
- We're gonna make it.

777
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,374
We didn't make it.
