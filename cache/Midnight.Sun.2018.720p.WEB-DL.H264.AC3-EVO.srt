00:00:56,446 --> 00:00:58,246
<i>I have this reoccurring dream.</i>

3
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,117
<i>I'm a little
girl sitting with my mom,</i>

4
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:05,153
<i>and she's singing to me.</i>

5
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:08,123
<i>I feel the warmth
of the sun on my skin</i>

6
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,694
<i>and the comfort of her arms
around me.</i>

7
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:13,230
<i>And I wanna stay there.</i>

8
00:01:14,298 --> 00:01:16,231
<i>Forever.</i>

9
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:19,836
<i>When I wake up,
I miss the dream.</i>

10
00:01:19,838 --> 00:01:22,638
<i>I want so badly
for this dream to be real,</i>

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,307
<i>but that would be impossible</i>

12
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:28,409
<i>because my mom died
when I was really little.</i>

13
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:30,379
<i>And I can't go out in the sun.</i>

14
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,081
<i>Like, at all.</i>

15
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:36,517
<i>I have a rare genetic condition
called Xeroderma Pigmentosum,</i>

16
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,121
<i>or XP, which basically means</i>

17
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:42,290
<i>a severe sensitivity
to sunlight.</i>

18
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:44,793
<i>If the sun hits my skin,
I get skin cancer,</i>

19
00:01:44,795 --> 00:01:47,364
<i>my brain starts to fail
and I could die.</i>

20
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:49,865
<i>Pretty fun, right?</i>

21
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:53,734
<i>So, I spend all my time indoors
behind special windows,</i>

22
00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:57,739
<i>hanging out with my dad
who is the best dad ever.</i>

23
00:01:57,741 --> 00:01:59,875
<i>Thank goodness,
because growing up,</i>

24
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:02,743
<i>kids were, uh,
what you'd expect.</i>

25
00:02:02,745 --> 00:02:04,848
- No way.
- Yep, a vampire.

26
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,748
That's why they have
special windows.

27
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,851
Don't worry. She can't
get us during the day.

28
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:12,653
But at night,
stay far, far away.

29
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:14,615
<i>But not everyone
was afraid of me.</i>

30
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:19,296
- Hey, Morgan.
- What's wrong with her?

31
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:25,467
She has something called XP.

32
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:29,841
Basically, the light from
the sun, it-it hurts her.

33
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:33,609
So she can't ever go
in the sun.

34
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,879
I can't be in the sun
for too long either.

35
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:38,379
Can she play at night?

36
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:40,184
- Yeah, but...
- See you tonight.

37
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:43,352
Oh, and I like pizza!

38
00:02:43,354 --> 00:02:45,386
<i>From that point on,</i>

39
00:02:45,388 --> 00:02:47,824
<i>it was me, Morgan and my dad.</i>

40
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:51,827
<i>Until one day, I saw Charlie.</i>

41
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:54,163
<i>And that was it.</i>

42
00:02:54,165 --> 00:02:56,866
<i>I was completely,
totally, utterly hooked.</i>

43
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:58,933
Stupid tree.

44
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:00,769
<i>I saw him every day.</i>

45
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:03,475
<i>And yet,
he had no idea I even existed.</i>

46
00:03:05,176 --> 00:03:07,175
<i>Over time,
watching Charlie go by</i>

47
00:03:07,177 --> 00:03:08,813
<i>just became
a part of my routine.</i>

48
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:12,517
<i>Along with constant
doctor appointments.</i>

49
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,685
<i>Sleeping during the day
and staying up all night,</i>

50
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:19,388
<i>which, from what I've heard,</i>

51
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,390
<i>is the schedule
of most teenagers.</i>

52
00:03:21,392 --> 00:03:25,426
<i>And playing music
every chance I get.</i>

53
00:03:25,428 --> 00:03:28,430
<i>All things considered,
I've got a pretty great life.</i>

54
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:30,899
<i>But I still hold onto my dreams.</i>

55
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:33,367
Stupid tree.

56
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:35,537
<i>No matter
how impossible they may seem.</i>

57
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:02,563
Jeremy Pierce.

58
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,801
Kendall Porter.

59
00:04:05,803 --> 00:04:06,935
Congratulations.

60
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:08,273
Peter Rathbard.

61
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:12,241
- Charles Reed.
- Yeah, Charlie!

62
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,847
Congratulations, Charlie.

63
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,549
Katie Price!

64
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:22,718
What are you wearing?

65
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,687
Oh, cap and gown. Huh?

66
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:27,292
The faculty and staff
always wear one.

67
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:29,391
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

68
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:33,362
Most importantly,
this is for you.

69
00:04:33,364 --> 00:04:34,897
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

70
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,302
I assume, as valedictorian,
you have a speech prepared. Yes?

71
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:43,004
Um, yes.

72
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:44,473
That's me
putting on my glasses.

73
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:45,940
- I like that. Nice touch.
- Thank you.

74
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:49,377
Um, first, I would
like to thank my headmaster.

75
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:51,512
- Well, I mean...
- My Spanish teacher.

76
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:52,849
<i>De nada.</i>

77
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:55,684
- My English teacher.
- It was my pleasure.

78
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:57,552
But I really wanna
state for the record

79
00:04:57,554 --> 00:05:00,923
that my gym teacher had absolutely
no idea what he was doing...

80
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:04,660
What? Oh, you suck.
I lift weights.

81
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:05,831
Hey, this is for you.

82
00:05:10,868 --> 00:05:13,567
This is one of the lamest things
I've ever seen.

83
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,470
Yes!

84
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:17,706
I had to go to three stores
to find something this lame.

85
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,940
- I mean, it's horrific.
- Yeah! It's the worst.

86
00:05:19,942 --> 00:05:21,009
Yeah.

87
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:22,711
All right.

88
00:05:22,713 --> 00:05:24,713
Are you ready for your present?

89
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:26,615
- There's a present involved?
- Oh, there's a present, yes!

90
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,350
Of course, there's a present.
It's graduation...

91
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:29,992
This just keeps getting
better and better.

92
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:41,899
This is Mom's.

93
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,643
Look, I know
it's kind of old,

94
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,577
so if you want a newer one
I totally under...

95
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:58,916
No, I love it!
Thank you. Thank you so much.

96
00:06:06,956 --> 00:06:08,425
You look just like your mother.

97
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,396
Lucky you.
She was hot.

98
00:06:12,396 --> 00:06:13,562
Ew.

99
00:06:13,564 --> 00:06:15,834
Try and get some sleep.
All right?

100
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:44,565
I can't believe this is happening.

101
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:56,506
Ooh.

102
00:06:57,975 --> 00:06:59,440
That's a good one.

103
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:01,942
Uh, something weird's
going on right here.

104
00:07:04,614 --> 00:07:07,615
Hey, Dad, um...
I was wondering

105
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:09,550
if I could go play
my new beautiful present

106
00:07:09,552 --> 00:07:10,754
at the train station
tonight.

107
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:15,557
It's 10:00.

108
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:17,658
Why can't Morgan just come over?
You could play here for me.

109
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,093
Morgan's busy
with her family.

110
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:21,897
And, Dad, I love playing
for you, I really do,

111
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,031
but I also need
to get used to playing

112
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:26,000
in front of
other people too.

113
00:07:26,002 --> 00:07:27,468
Please, please, please.

114
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,637
Fred will be there.
He'll watch out for me.

115
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,139
And I graduated today!

116
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:34,545
Isn't that the American
tradition, to extend my curfew?

117
00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:40,581
Okay, I'll extend
your curfew one hour.

118
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,783
Which means midnight, okay?

119
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:44,185
Hey, and text me
right when you get there,

120
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:45,553
or I'm not
just gonna call Fred,

121
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:46,721
I'm actually
gonna come down there.

122
00:07:46,723 --> 00:07:49,156
And it will be so embarrassing,
it'll become urban legend

123
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:51,725
- on why kids should stick to their curfew!
- I love you.

124
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:09,811
Oh, boy.

125
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:17,519
Oh. Hey,
don't do that thing.

126
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:18,854
What thing?

127
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:22,490
That. I mean, you look all sad
and it makes me sad.

128
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:24,124
Please just chug this beer
and come hang out!

129
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:26,093
Dude, you
dodged a bullet, man.

130
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:28,897
You were gonna be up at the ass
crack of dawn every morning

131
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:31,499
taking tests,
nowhere near the beach.

132
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:34,034
And now, we get to do this...
our whole lives.

133
00:08:34,036 --> 00:08:37,639
Hmm, I forgot,
doing this our whole lives,

134
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:39,401
it's way better
than a full ride to Berkeley.

135
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:42,078
Zoe Carmichael. 3:00.

136
00:08:44,849 --> 00:08:48,249
- Charlie... you're in trouble.
- What did I do this time?

137
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:49,818
You didn't get me a drink.

138
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,620
I did not know
you were thirsty.

139
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:52,689
Now you do.

140
00:08:54,724 --> 00:08:56,460
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

141
00:08:57,227 --> 00:08:58,463
Is that the bad one?

142
00:08:59,695 --> 00:09:01,796
Well, now that
you're not swimming,

143
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:05,232
maybe you'll have
a little extra time for me.

144
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:07,034
I also have some
extra time for you.

145
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:08,970
- And I'm not swimming.
- You were never swimming, idiot.

146
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:10,639
Zoe! Get over here, bitch!

147
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:12,307
Hold on!

148
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:13,942
You're coming to
my graduation party, right?

149
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:15,210
Yeah, I think so.

150
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:16,212
Good.

151
00:09:17,314 --> 00:09:18,916
Yeah!

152
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,820
What... What are you doing?

153
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:25,120
Dodging another bullet.

154
00:09:25,122 --> 00:09:27,621
Come on, dude.
It's our graduation night.

155
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:28,625
I'm not feeling it, boys.

156
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,727
I'll see you later.

157
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:34,598
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

158
00:09:38,234 --> 00:09:39,668
Hey, yo, Fred.

159
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,001
I was wondering if I was
gonna see you tonight.

160
00:09:41,003 --> 00:09:43,270
What, and disappoint
all my fans?

161
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:42,126
Hey.

162
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,830
Whoa.

163
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:50,832
I didn't mean
to freak you out.

164
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:51,869
Here.

165
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,705
Uh, me? I'm not freaked out.
Don't worry about it.

166
00:11:56,707 --> 00:11:58,339
- Here, I'll help you.
- I'm not a freak.

167
00:11:58,341 --> 00:12:00,774
Why are you packing up?
Where are you going?

168
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:02,777
Um, home.
I gotta go home.

169
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:04,882
Home? Wait, you live here?

170
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,414
Wait, you didn't
go to Purdue High.

171
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,750
No. It's a very
different school.

172
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:13,187
And I graduated today and
my dad's a super big worrier.

173
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:15,325
So, I really gotta...
Oh, God.

174
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:23,030
- Um...
- I have to go.

175
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:25,335
Wait! Wait! Whoa. What...
I'm sorry, why are you...

176
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:27,803
What's the rush? What...

177
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:30,772
Um, I have to get home
to my cat.

178
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:33,309
- Your cat.
- Yeah, it died.

179
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:38,513
So, you're not
in a rush then, right?

180
00:12:38,515 --> 00:12:41,249
No, no, I am.
I have to plan the funeral

181
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:44,853
for my, um, dead cat that died.

182
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:46,389
Yeah, it's super dead.

183
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:50,795
Wait! Wait! Wait!

184
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:53,448
I didn't even get your name!

185
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:13,548
You haven't noticed any changes in
her? Motor functions still seem strong?

186
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,216
Yeah. Yeah, no loss
of intellectual function,

187
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:19,354
no difficulty swallowing
or talking.

188
00:13:19,356 --> 00:13:21,322
Believe me on that.

189
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:24,894
And no corneal ulcerations.

190
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:28,499
Really, there's nothing to
suggest any neurodegeneration.

191
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:31,331
Any exposure to sunlight?

192
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,069
No, of course not.

193
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:36,504
I'm gonna refill her
prescription for you this time,

194
00:13:36,506 --> 00:13:38,986
but she really should be coming
to these appointments with you.

195
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:42,009
Yeah, well, you know teenagers.

196
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:43,371
They get embarrassed
by their dads.

197
00:13:44,514 --> 00:13:47,548
- She has XP, Jack.
- I know exactly what she has.

198
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,082
It's not gonna
fall into remission.

199
00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:51,519
And every year, the risk
becomes more serious for her.

200
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:53,889
So, if she's exposed to even
the slightest bit of sunlight...

201
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:56,224
She won't be.

202
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:58,863
- She's reached that age we talked about.
- She won't be.

203
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:05,232
Any word on the University
of Washington study?

204
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:09,336
I submitted Katie's name for their Phase
Two trials, if it even gets that far.

205
00:14:09,338 --> 00:14:11,471
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

206
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:13,341
Research funding
being what it is,

207
00:14:13,343 --> 00:14:16,183
we're talking about a disease that
affects only one in a million people.

208
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:22,152
We're in luck,
'cause she is one in a million.

209
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:28,425
A cat funeral?

210
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:31,259
Please stop saying it out loud.

211
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:33,895
No, I mean,
I've heard that dead pets

212
00:14:33,897 --> 00:14:35,363
can actually be
an aphrodisiac.

213
00:14:35,365 --> 00:14:37,866
Morgan, what should I have said?

214
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:40,301
Any other combination of words
in the English language.

215
00:14:40,303 --> 00:14:42,269
Like, "Hey, I'm Katie Price.

216
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:44,438
I've watched you outside
my window for the past 10 years,

217
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,542
and I've been in love with you,
stalking you every minute of the day."

218
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:51,144
- Okay, don't start with that...
- Or how about, "Hey, you may remember me from kindergarten,

219
00:14:51,146 --> 00:14:52,614
when everyone
called me a vampire."

220
00:14:52,616 --> 00:14:54,514
No one remembers that!

221
00:14:54,516 --> 00:14:57,585
- What did I do?
- It's bad, but we'll fix it.

222
00:14:57,587 --> 00:15:01,089
I feel so stupid and lame.

223
00:15:01,091 --> 00:15:02,593
Well, at least
you have M&M's. So...

224
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:06,463
Thanks.

225
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,466
So, you've just gotta
make up for it next time.

226
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:13,100
There's not gonna be
a next time.

227
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:14,939
- You don't know that.
- I do.

228
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:18,339
This is good.
This is what Taylor Swift does.

229
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:20,041
She has awkward
interactions with boys,

230
00:15:20,043 --> 00:15:23,411
and then she just writes
amazing songs about it. What?

231
00:15:23,413 --> 00:15:25,613
Oh, no, no.

232
00:15:25,615 --> 00:15:28,383
- Oh, come on.
- What's happening?

233
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,650
Did you see my notebook
when you came in?

234
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:31,985
Your notebook notebook? No.

235
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:33,453
I think I left it
at the train station.

236
00:15:33,455 --> 00:15:36,256
- Oh, God.
- Can you please go get it for me?

237
00:15:36,258 --> 00:15:38,426
Morgan, it's so important.
Please.

238
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:41,095
You know, I would,
but there's, like,

239
00:15:41,097 --> 00:15:43,457
a few other poppin' cat funerals
that I was gonna hit today.

240
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,270
No, no! I'm in a corner! Oh!

241
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,446
Hey.

242
00:15:58,448 --> 00:15:59,714
My friend's
been looking for that.

243
00:15:59,716 --> 00:16:01,251
You know her? Oh, wait.

244
00:16:02,584 --> 00:16:04,552
Morgan, right?
We had English class together.

245
00:16:04,554 --> 00:16:08,155
- I'm Charlie...
- Charlie Reed, yeah. I know.

246
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:09,523
And it was a history class.

247
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:10,725
But how do you know her?

248
00:16:10,727 --> 00:16:12,527
- Did she just move here?
- Notebook first.

249
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:16,033
Or you could just tell me where she
lives and I could drop it off.

250
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,501
I have a better idea.

251
00:16:23,473 --> 00:16:26,073
Hey, Dad, I need to go to the train
station to pick up my notebook.

252
00:16:26,075 --> 00:16:27,341
Fred has it.

253
00:16:27,343 --> 00:16:29,313
Okay, text me when you get there
and be careful.

254
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:39,221
Fred?

255
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,159
Holy pregnant cow.

256
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:48,296
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

257
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,563
Oh, my God.

258
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:51,000
Thank you.

259
00:16:55,104 --> 00:16:56,269
Purdue Creamery.

260
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:59,340
- Morgan.
- Hey. How's your second date?

261
00:16:59,342 --> 00:17:00,774
How could you do this to me?

262
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:02,110
Oh, my God,
I'm in sweatpants.

263
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:05,212
My hair, it's-it's a mess.
It's tied.

264
00:17:05,214 --> 00:17:07,048
Oh, my God,
I look like an idiot.

265
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,018
Oh, please. Katie,
you're super freakin' hot, okay?

266
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,286
I can't even see you right now and
I can tell you look gorgeous.

267
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:13,653
Hi, excuse me.
Can I just get a large...

268
00:17:13,655 --> 00:17:15,291
Can you not see
I'm on the phone?

269
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,693
He really likes you, okay?
I can tell.

270
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:22,430
<i>Just try to be yourself.
Don't ramble too much.</i>

271
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:23,698
And call me afterwards.

272
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:26,568
Bye.

273
00:17:32,207 --> 00:17:34,210
Oh, my...

274
00:17:45,722 --> 00:17:47,622
Wow, you exist.

275
00:17:47,624 --> 00:17:50,290
I thought I was dreaming
last night or something.

276
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:53,126
Were you in the REM
stage of sleep?

277
00:17:53,128 --> 00:17:54,261
What?

278
00:17:54,263 --> 00:17:56,763
That's when most
dreams happen, actually.

279
00:17:56,765 --> 00:18:00,134
Yeah, your brain activity
is super high and functioning,

280
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:03,270
and your eyes are just going
nuts behind your eyelids.

281
00:18:03,272 --> 00:18:06,774
It looks super weird. It's like
a typewriter or something.

282
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:09,443
Um, anyway, thank you for...

283
00:18:09,445 --> 00:18:11,711
Wait, I, uh... I still
don't know your name.

284
00:18:11,713 --> 00:18:12,713
Oh.

285
00:18:13,782 --> 00:18:16,183
- It's Katie.
- Katie, I'm Charlie.

286
00:18:17,686 --> 00:18:19,686
Wow, that's a weird name.

287
00:18:19,688 --> 00:18:22,623
Thank God you told me it 'cause I
wouldn't have known it otherwise.

288
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,459
Thank you.

289
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:26,030
- Wait, what...
- You didn't...

290
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:31,499
You didn't read through it,
did you?

291
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,201
Uh, just a little. I...

292
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:34,402
- What?
- What?

293
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,369
Are you serious?
You read through my journal?

294
00:18:36,371 --> 00:18:38,205
- Look, I...
- This could have been a diary.

295
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,808
I mean, it is, kind of.

296
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,741
Um, I'm... I'm really sorry.

297
00:18:41,743 --> 00:18:43,743
You left really quick
the other night,

298
00:18:43,745 --> 00:18:45,346
and I really had no idea
who it belonged to,

299
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:46,747
so I just
looked through it quickly.

300
00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:48,850
But I like that you
still handwrite things.

301
00:18:48,852 --> 00:18:50,753
It's... It's cool.
It's old school.

302
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,857
Thanks... for finding it.

303
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:56,859
Yeah.

304
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:00,661
Wait!

305
00:19:00,663 --> 00:19:02,262
What, another cat died?
You have to...

306
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:03,364
Oh.

307
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:05,432
Um...

308
00:19:05,434 --> 00:19:09,703
I... I had to... I... I'm...
I'm walking home.

309
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:10,706
Can I walk with you?

310
00:19:12,842 --> 00:19:14,809
Um, yeah.

311
00:19:14,811 --> 00:19:18,145
So, you were home-schooled, huh?
Man, that must have been wild.

312
00:19:18,147 --> 00:19:20,915
Actually, it was the exact
opposite of wild.

313
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:23,151
My dad's pretty protective.

314
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:26,287
He's not, like, watching us
right now, is he?

315
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:29,390
Oh, yeah. He has his phone
tapped into every camera.

316
00:19:32,194 --> 00:19:35,930
So, um, what did you think
of the songs you read?

317
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:39,232
Without my permission,
I may add.

318
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:41,538
Um, honestly, I don't know.

319
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,605
I mean, you can't really
read a song, right?

320
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:45,907
True.

321
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:48,643
I guess I'd have
to hear you sing them.

322
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,645
Um, so anyway,
I'm right up here.

323
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:53,516
So, you don't have to walk me.

324
00:19:55,217 --> 00:19:57,384
Wait, you live up there?

325
00:19:57,386 --> 00:19:58,952
I-I don't understand
how we've never met.

326
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:00,453
I've probably
skated by your house,

327
00:20:00,455 --> 00:20:01,788
like, every day
on the way to practice.

328
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,827
It's a... funny coincidence.

329
00:20:08,463 --> 00:20:09,500
Um...

330
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:11,801
thanks.

331
00:20:15,204 --> 00:20:17,540
Hey, you wouldn't wanna do
something sometime, would you?

332
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:21,275
Um... together?

333
00:20:21,277 --> 00:20:23,915
Yes, us together.
Hanging out.

334
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:28,784
Um... I'm really busy
during the day.

335
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,925
But... I could be free at night.

336
00:20:35,357 --> 00:20:36,857
I could be free at night.

337
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:39,929
Well, you should
put your number in here then.

338
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:45,333
I'm old school too.

339
00:20:45,335 --> 00:20:46,502
Smooth.

340
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:48,805
Thank you.

341
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:56,245
That is so romantic
it disgusts me.

342
00:20:57,946 --> 00:20:59,446
What did he say about your XP?

343
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:01,481
It didn't come up.

344
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:03,284
What do you mean,
it didn't come up?

345
00:21:03,286 --> 00:21:05,353
I-I didn't bring it up.

346
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:07,288
I'm not gonna just
randomly be like,

347
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,557
"Hey, dude, by the way,
the sunlight's gonna..."

348
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:15,028
Like, look when you
tell someone you're sick,

349
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:19,767
then you start to become more like
a disease and less like a person.

350
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:22,369
It's... I'm gonna tell him,
I promise,

351
00:21:22,371 --> 00:21:24,505
but I don't know
when I'm gonna see him again.

352
00:21:24,507 --> 00:21:26,473
I do.

353
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:28,809
You know that annoying guy who works
with me at the ice cream shop?

354
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:31,847
- The nerdy one you hate?
- Yes, Garver.

355
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:34,649
His parents are out of town tonight
and he's throwing a party.

356
00:21:34,651 --> 00:21:36,483
And he told me to bring friends.

357
00:21:36,485 --> 00:21:38,920
- So, I'm gonna bring you...
- No, no, no, no, no...

358
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,489
- And you're gonna bring Charlie.
- No.

359
00:21:41,491 --> 00:21:44,325
He's gotta, like, you know...

360
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:47,728
Doesn't... I have to wait
till he texts me first, right?

361
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,563
Yeah, totally.

362
00:21:49,565 --> 00:21:52,299
And then, you know, his squire will
send a note via carrier pigeon

363
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:53,835
asking if you'd like
to merge your kingdoms.

364
00:21:53,837 --> 00:21:55,837
What is this,
18th-century England?

365
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,637
You're a hot,
young, badass woman.

366
00:21:57,639 --> 00:21:59,843
You're gonna text him
whenever you damn well please.

367
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,778
Be confident, okay?

368
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,514
- Give him the facts.
- Okay.

369
00:22:15,826 --> 00:22:18,358
- Play a little hard to get.
- All right.

370
00:22:21,463 --> 00:22:23,798
Make sure that he knows he's not
the only reason you're going.

371
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,399
Okay.

372
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:26,603
All right.

373
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:29,936
Oh, no.

374
00:22:38,513 --> 00:22:40,980
This is gonna be a tame,
safe, parent-friendly party.

375
00:22:40,982 --> 00:22:42,884
Ah-ha!
It's a totally lame party.

376
00:22:42,886 --> 00:22:44,853
You know what we should do?
We should stay here.

377
00:22:44,855 --> 00:22:47,954
We'll get Hunan Chinese.
You guys love Hunan, right?

378
00:22:47,956 --> 00:22:49,458
Put some Netflix on.
It'll be perfect.

379
00:22:51,027 --> 00:22:53,059
Dad, you know
I'm a good kid.

380
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:54,863
You know I'm not gonna
do anything crazy.

381
00:22:54,865 --> 00:22:57,530
But I swear,
if I spend one more night here,

382
00:22:57,532 --> 00:22:59,999
just listening to everyone else
outside my window

383
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:03,005
living their lives,
I might go crazy.

384
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:09,814
Tomorrow night, we can order way too much
chow mein, and have a movie marathon.

385
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:16,616
- All right.
- Yes, thank you!

386
00:23:16,618 --> 00:23:18,519
You're the best dad
in the world.

387
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:20,453
Thanks, Mr. P!

388
00:23:20,455 --> 00:23:24,392
Okay, um, Charlie's gonna
meet us at Garver's at 8:00.

389
00:23:24,394 --> 00:23:25,625
We have to get ready!

390
00:23:25,627 --> 00:23:26,827
Dude, what are you
talking about?

391
00:23:26,829 --> 00:23:28,732
We have, like, three hours.

392
00:23:29,698 --> 00:23:31,033
We're already behind.

393
00:23:33,168 --> 00:23:34,168
Done.

394
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:41,344
Mr. P! May I present
Katherine Price of Washington.

395
00:23:52,155 --> 00:23:53,155
Wow.

396
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:58,859
Peanut... you look amazing.

397
00:24:00,596 --> 00:24:02,962
Bye, Mr. P!

398
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:10,640
Let's go.

399
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:20,921
God, I can't believe
Garver's throwing a kegger.

400
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,983
You came.

401
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:27,788
Is there any chance that you,
or your hot friend, hey,

402
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:31,624
know how to get beer
out of a keg?

403
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:33,862
Oh, no.

404
00:24:33,864 --> 00:24:37,530
- You didn't get a tap?
- I didn't realize they were separate things.

405
00:24:37,532 --> 00:24:40,034
Why would they sell me a barrel
of beer I can't even access?

406
00:24:50,178 --> 00:24:52,579
Garver! What the hell?

407
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:55,649
This is a tame, safe,
parent-friendly party!

408
00:24:55,651 --> 00:24:57,954
Uh, do tame parties
have sundae bars?

409
00:24:59,555 --> 00:25:01,154
I think it's so cool.

410
00:25:01,156 --> 00:25:02,824
No, don't listen to her.

411
00:25:02,826 --> 00:25:04,258
Okay, she's never been
to a party before.

412
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,693
She doesn't understand
how dire the situation is.

413
00:25:06,695 --> 00:25:08,162
- We gotta go.
- What, you're leaving?

414
00:25:08,164 --> 00:25:10,230
No, no, no. I just made
a huge thing of chili.

415
00:25:10,232 --> 00:25:12,266
Garver,
chili is not a party food.

416
00:25:13,735 --> 00:25:15,872
You see, the party's
just kicking off.

417
00:25:20,142 --> 00:25:22,076
What's Charlie Reed doing here?

418
00:25:22,078 --> 00:25:23,078
Oh, my God.

419
00:25:33,222 --> 00:25:34,223
Hi.

420
00:25:39,962 --> 00:25:41,097
You look really amazing.

421
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:45,837
Um... oh, it's all Morgan.

422
00:25:46,935 --> 00:25:48,635
No, I don't think so.

423
00:25:48,637 --> 00:25:50,805
For you, good sir.

424
00:25:50,807 --> 00:25:51,975
Oh, thank you.

425
00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:54,307
Thank you.

426
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:55,309
Beef chili, huh?

427
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:02,583
Mm. That's top shelf, buddy.
That's fresh.

428
00:26:02,585 --> 00:26:05,685
You know, I really thought we'd
have a bigger turnout, but...

429
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:07,654
I told you not to go
up against a cheerleader.

430
00:26:07,656 --> 00:26:09,323
What cheerleader?

431
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:11,624
It's the mean blonde one
with a convertible.

432
00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:12,692
- Zoe Carmichael?
- Yes.

433
00:26:13,796 --> 00:26:15,628
She's having a party
tonight as well.

434
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,730
Must have dinged our turnout.

435
00:26:17,732 --> 00:26:18,965
Do you guys wanna go there?

436
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:20,968
Well, I like the idea.

437
00:26:22,704 --> 00:26:26,774
- Hey.
- I was wondering where you were.

438
00:26:26,776 --> 00:26:28,876
- Who are these people?
- Oh, these are my friends.

439
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,146
And they brought you a keg.

440
00:26:35,151 --> 00:26:37,585
Great. Come on in.

441
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,803
Charlie!

442
00:26:55,972 --> 00:26:57,040
Hey, what's up, man?

443
00:27:04,113 --> 00:27:05,148
You good?

444
00:27:06,382 --> 00:27:09,149
Hey, I'm gonna
go take a lap upstairs.

445
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:10,151
Away from you two.

446
00:27:13,155 --> 00:27:14,253
Thank you.

447
00:27:14,255 --> 00:27:16,191
Your friend Morgan,
she seems cool.

448
00:27:17,393 --> 00:27:18,859
Yeah. She's really cool.

449
00:27:20,162 --> 00:27:21,996
How long have you guys
known each other?

450
00:27:21,998 --> 00:27:23,732
I don't know. Like, forever.

451
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:28,001
- He's back.
- Oh!

452
00:27:28,003 --> 00:27:29,636
Charlie! Whoa!

453
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:32,338
Whoa. Who is this?

454
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,343
Uh, Owen, Wes,
this is Katie Price.

455
00:27:36,345 --> 00:27:37,644
- Hey.
- Hi.

456
00:27:37,646 --> 00:27:39,646
Katie, you're... you're...

457
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,884
- Um...-
- You got Charlie to come to a party,

458
00:27:42,886 --> 00:27:44,818
and make a smile-like feature.

459
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,788
Our boy hasn't looked
this good in a long time.

460
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,091
There you are.

461
00:27:52,094 --> 00:27:53,895
I'm still thirsty.

462
00:27:53,897 --> 00:27:55,328
Wanna get me that drink now?

463
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:59,400
I'm actually about to go take
Katie on the house party tour.

464
00:27:59,402 --> 00:28:01,201
So. You ready?

465
00:28:02,738 --> 00:28:04,938
- We'll be right back.
- Nice meeting you guys.

466
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,460
- Nice to meet you, Katie.
- Take care.

467
00:28:07,943 --> 00:28:09,423
- I can quench your thirst.
- Shut up.

468
00:28:39,876 --> 00:28:41,910
Would you like
to dance with me?

469
00:28:41,912 --> 00:28:45,479
Garver, what on earth makes you think
I'd ever want to dance with you?

470
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,955
You know, if you tell anyone
about this, I'll kill you.

471
00:28:55,957 --> 00:28:57,026
Totally.

472
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:04,132
Hey, hey!

473
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:06,999
- Hey.
- Gotta stay hydrated.

474
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:08,038
Thank you.

475
00:29:10,205 --> 00:29:12,071
This is really interesting.

476
00:29:12,073 --> 00:29:15,344
I don't think
I've ever seen this happen.

477
00:29:16,412 --> 00:29:18,010
Yeah.

478
00:29:18,012 --> 00:29:20,848
Classic high school,
awkward party.

479
00:29:22,017 --> 00:29:23,517
I've only seen it at the movies.

480
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:25,419
I gotta show you this.
Come on.

481
00:29:25,421 --> 00:29:27,023
- Oh, God.
- Come on.

482
00:29:28,858 --> 00:29:30,860
Okay, similar
to what's going on over here.

483
00:29:31,926 --> 00:29:33,295
We just kind of hold here.

484
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:37,767
And swing the hips awkwardly.

485
00:29:39,969 --> 00:29:41,802
- Am I doing it?
- Yeah, you're kind of.

486
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:43,405
And then I would slowly back up.

487
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,893
Everybody! This is the best
night of my life! Yeah!

488
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:12,735
You wanna go someplace else?

489
00:30:13,803 --> 00:30:14,839
Okay.

490
00:30:16,938 --> 00:30:18,238
I-I don't get it.

491
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,039
How could they just
take your scholarship away?

492
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:22,810
Well, I had to have surgery.

493
00:30:22,812 --> 00:30:24,747
And they didn't think
I could ever swim again.

494
00:30:26,281 --> 00:30:29,016
And no more scholarship
meant no more Berkeley.

495
00:30:29,018 --> 00:30:32,352
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.

496
00:30:32,354 --> 00:30:35,422
So, how did you do it?
How did you hurt yourself?

497
00:30:35,424 --> 00:30:37,490
It was just a freak accident.

498
00:30:37,492 --> 00:30:39,294
You know, I fell down
some stairs and...

499
00:30:41,396 --> 00:30:43,297
And that's not true.

500
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,598
That's kind of what
I tell everybody.

501
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,469
I got really drunk one night
at Owen's house.

502
00:30:50,138 --> 00:30:53,843
And my friends dared me to jump
off the roof into the pool...

503
00:30:55,277 --> 00:30:57,013
and I clipped the edge
with my shoulder.

504
00:31:00,382 --> 00:31:01,615
I'm such an idiot.

505
00:31:01,617 --> 00:31:03,286
I don't wanna be that guy,
you know?

506
00:31:07,388 --> 00:31:08,456
Then don't be.

507
00:31:10,894 --> 00:31:13,292
You know, my mom used to take me
here when I was little.

508
00:31:13,294 --> 00:31:18,298
- Really?
- She sat me right there.

509
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,368
And, um, she tried to teach me
how to play the guitar.

510
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:26,006
Actually, this watch was hers.

511
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:29,942
I spent so much time looking
at this thing on her hand.

512
00:31:29,944 --> 00:31:31,313
And...

513
00:31:34,116 --> 00:31:38,417
um, she died when I was little.

514
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:41,622
- She was in a car accident.
- I'm-I'm so sorry.

515
00:31:41,624 --> 00:31:43,155
- You know, we can go someplace...
- No.

516
00:31:43,157 --> 00:31:46,226
No, no. No, no.
No, I'm... I'm good.

517
00:31:46,228 --> 00:31:48,833
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah. I promise.

518
00:31:51,532 --> 00:31:52,935
You wanna see
something cool?

519
00:31:55,303 --> 00:31:56,936
Ta-da!

520
00:31:56,938 --> 00:31:59,573
- This is yours?
- No.

521
00:31:59,575 --> 00:32:02,476
But it's something I'm taking
care of for the summer.

522
00:32:02,478 --> 00:32:04,611
It's a Jespersen 53.

523
00:32:04,613 --> 00:32:06,216
Wow.

524
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,386
One of these days we could take
her for a sail around the harbor,

525
00:32:13,388 --> 00:32:14,388
we can watch the sun set.

526
00:32:24,232 --> 00:32:27,302
That sounds perfect.

527
00:32:50,425 --> 00:32:53,093
Um, just, let me get out of...

528
00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:57,667
Sorry.

529
00:32:59,702 --> 00:33:01,567
So, what are
you gonna do this year,

530
00:33:01,569 --> 00:33:03,202
now that you're
not going to Berkeley?

531
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:06,239
Well, first I'm gonna
get a new truck.

532
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,680
And then I'm gonna
drive across the country.

533
00:33:12,414 --> 00:33:14,448
You know, I've been in
the pool my entire life,

534
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,419
and, uh, I haven't
got to see much else, so...

535
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,422
- Um, what are you gonna do...
- I'm not doing anything.

536
00:33:22,424 --> 00:33:26,460
I'm just gonna take some
online courses, I think.

537
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:30,396
But I'll just be here.

538
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:32,167
I, uh... I meant
what are you doing tomorrow?

539
00:33:33,234 --> 00:33:36,135
Oh. Oh! Oh, God.

540
00:33:36,137 --> 00:33:39,708
Um... I...

541
00:33:42,077 --> 00:33:44,644
I'm busy during the day,

542
00:33:44,646 --> 00:33:47,381
but I can be free
tomorrow night.

543
00:33:47,383 --> 00:33:48,484
That's perfect.

544
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:52,588
- I'll see you tomorrow night?
- Okay.

545
00:33:59,494 --> 00:34:01,063
I have something to tell you.

546
00:34:03,331 --> 00:34:05,432
I don't actually have a cat.

547
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:07,467
No shit.

548
00:34:18,513 --> 00:34:22,082
- Who are you texting?
- Hmm? No one.

549
00:34:23,584 --> 00:34:28,087
- Morgan, who are you texting?
- Garver.

550
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:29,455
Hmm?

551
00:34:29,457 --> 00:34:32,058
Um, I can't hear you
when you're whispering...

552
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,459
Garver!
I made out with Garver.

553
00:34:33,461 --> 00:34:37,464
No! He's really, really cute.

554
00:34:37,466 --> 00:34:40,533
And he totally likes you.

555
00:34:40,535 --> 00:34:45,138
By the way, can I tell my dad that
I'm going over to yours tonight,

556
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,700
so I can go hang out
with Charlie later?

557
00:34:48,844 --> 00:34:50,743
You're asking me to help you
lie to your father,

558
00:34:50,745 --> 00:34:51,945
so you can
hang out with a guy?

559
00:34:53,182 --> 00:34:55,251
I've never been
so proud of you!

560
00:34:58,086 --> 00:35:00,187
Uh, Dad, I'm gonna
go over to Morgan's tonight.

561
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:02,388
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, yeah, no problem.

562
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,526
Hey, how was that party?

563
00:35:06,627 --> 00:35:08,261
Party was nice.

564
00:35:08,263 --> 00:35:09,796
Did you meet any fun people?

565
00:35:09,798 --> 00:35:12,265
No. Not really.

566
00:35:12,267 --> 00:35:15,234
Everybody was kind of just,
like, ugh, you know?

567
00:35:15,236 --> 00:35:17,404
Nobody was really there.
It was just...

568
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,840
- So I'm gonna...
- skedaddle.

569
00:35:19,842 --> 00:35:22,110
- Love you.
- Love you more.

570
00:35:27,115 --> 00:35:28,381
I'm lying.

571
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:31,053
Well, you were rambling,
so I kind of figured.

572
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,428
I'm going to go meet a boy
named Charlie Reed,

573
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,629
who's really nice and sweet.

574
00:35:43,631 --> 00:35:47,837
And I really, really
like him... a lot.

575
00:35:49,738 --> 00:35:52,339
- Are you mad?
- I'm not happy that you lied to me.

576
00:35:52,341 --> 00:35:54,341
You know you can
always tell me anything...

577
00:35:54,343 --> 00:35:55,578
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

578
00:35:57,211 --> 00:35:58,846
- Do you trust this guy?
- Yes.

579
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,584
- Will I hate him?
- No. No, you won't. I promise.

580
00:36:03,352 --> 00:36:04,851
- Does he know about your...
- I haven't told him yet.

581
00:36:04,853 --> 00:36:06,252
- No, Katie...
- But I will...

582
00:36:06,254 --> 00:36:08,321
No, I am not comfortable
with him not knowing.

583
00:36:08,323 --> 00:36:12,926
I know, I'm going to. I just
need a little bit longer of...

584
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:16,598
- What?
- ...being someone more than just a disease.

585
00:36:18,902 --> 00:36:22,435
- Katie.
- It's just a few more days, please?

586
00:36:22,437 --> 00:36:24,107
Like a normal girl.

587
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,241
Hey.

588
00:36:28,243 --> 00:36:31,178
Is it okay if me and Katie hang out
tonight together, the entire night?

589
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,645
I already
admitted everything.

590
00:36:32,647 --> 00:36:34,815
What, you couldn't
make it two hours?

591
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,653
It's pathetic.
I could've made it two hours.

592
00:36:44,292 --> 00:36:46,359
What does Katie Price
wanna do?

593
00:36:46,361 --> 00:36:48,495
There are so
many things I wanna do.

594
00:36:49,631 --> 00:36:51,531
I have always
wanted to do this.

595
00:37:02,377 --> 00:37:04,310
Ready?

596
00:37:50,826 --> 00:37:52,694
What about that one over there?

597
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,862
Um, that one's called Altair.

598
00:37:55,864 --> 00:37:58,330
And it's 16 light years away,

599
00:37:58,332 --> 00:38:00,500
which means the light
we're seeing now,

600
00:38:00,502 --> 00:38:01,982
was actually created
when we were two.

601
00:38:05,973 --> 00:38:06,973
Are you okay?

602
00:38:10,813 --> 00:38:12,849
The Berkeley coach called
my house the other night.

603
00:38:14,383 --> 00:38:15,682
Really?

604
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:18,384
Yeah, I mean, I guess
one of the other swimmers

605
00:38:18,386 --> 00:38:22,225
transferred out
and another spot opened up.

606
00:38:23,057 --> 00:38:24,957
Wow.

607
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:27,294
That's so crazy.
You could get your spot back?

608
00:38:27,296 --> 00:38:29,631
I mean, technically, yeah.

609
00:38:31,066 --> 00:38:32,833
There's this huge meet
coming up next month,

610
00:38:32,835 --> 00:38:36,069
and the Berkeley coach
is coming down to watch.

611
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:38,838
But I'd have to get in shape by
then, which is probably impossible.

612
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,941
And then I'd have to swim, like, my best
time ever to show that I'm fully rehabbed...

613
00:38:41,943 --> 00:38:43,613
You can totally do it.

614
00:38:51,385 --> 00:38:53,889
There's also some reasons
to stick around here next year.

615
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,030
Katie, I wanna take you
on a real date tomorrow.

616
00:39:02,763 --> 00:39:03,765
Okay.

617
00:39:06,068 --> 00:39:09,504
And you also need
to meet my dad.

618
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:18,878
Why don't you move
a little closer there, Cody?

619
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,513
My-My name's Charlie.

620
00:39:20,515 --> 00:39:21,647
- Charlie.
- Yeah.

621
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:23,385
Huh. I didn't know that.

622
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:29,988
Is that what you go by? You go by Charlie
and not Chuck or Chuckie or C-Town?

623
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,927
- No, sir, I... just Charlie.
- Charlie, okay.

624
00:39:34,662 --> 00:39:36,562
- You ever been arrested?
- No, sir.

625
00:39:36,564 --> 00:39:38,064
- When's your curfew?
- It's 1:00 a.m.

626
00:39:38,066 --> 00:39:41,066
- What time do you actually get home?
- Like, 2:00.

627
00:39:41,068 --> 00:39:42,701
That's not one 1:00,
is it, Charlie?

628
00:39:42,703 --> 00:39:44,470
- No, sir, it's not.
- You said your curfew was 1:00.

629
00:39:44,472 --> 00:39:46,372
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

630
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:48,077
Relax, I'm not a cop.

631
00:39:51,813 --> 00:39:53,513
How many times
a week do you shave?

632
00:39:53,515 --> 00:39:58,853
Shave, uh, like four...
four times a week, sir.

633
00:39:58,855 --> 00:39:59,920
- Who's your team?
- Seahawks.

634
00:39:59,922 --> 00:40:01,154
Why?

635
00:40:01,156 --> 00:40:02,788
Well, because they're great.

636
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,058
And one time I was
at this burger place and...

637
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,396
Richard Sherman actually
ate some of my fries.

638
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,499
That's awesome.

639
00:40:11,732 --> 00:40:15,470
Okay. Charlie, here's the deal.

640
00:40:17,606 --> 00:40:20,973
Katie appears to be
very strong, and she is.

641
00:40:20,975 --> 00:40:22,709
- Hey.
- She's dealing with...

642
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,811
- Hi.
- Hey.

643
00:40:23,813 --> 00:40:25,412
- What you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

644
00:40:25,414 --> 00:40:27,980
- We were...
- We're just getting to know each other.

645
00:40:27,982 --> 00:40:29,716
Thank you so much for letting me
take her out, Mr. Price.

646
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:30,718
Okay.

647
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,022
Oh, don't forget your...

648
00:40:34,756 --> 00:40:36,425
guitar case.

649
00:40:37,492 --> 00:40:39,860
Wait, I'll hold it for you.

650
00:40:39,862 --> 00:40:43,366
Uh, hold on a second.
I wanna get a picture of this.

651
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:45,768
Okay.

652
00:40:47,002 --> 00:40:51,671
All right. Just a little.
There you go.

653
00:40:51,673 --> 00:40:53,640
A little room
for the Holy Ghost.

654
00:40:53,642 --> 00:40:55,441
And...

655
00:40:55,443 --> 00:40:57,746
And... open.

656
00:41:01,048 --> 00:41:02,817
I believe
these are for you.

657
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:03,887
Wait.

658
00:41:05,187 --> 00:41:07,922
- Where are we going?
- I know nothing.

659
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,189
Fred.

660
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:11,394
- Don't even try.
- Thank you, Fred.

661
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:15,962
Okay, rule number one.

662
00:41:15,964 --> 00:41:17,729
When you're on a train,

663
00:41:17,731 --> 00:41:20,767
you must always travel with
Chinese food out of a backpack.

664
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:24,102
Well, I wouldn't know. I've
never been on a train before.

665
00:41:24,104 --> 00:41:25,504
Neither have I.

666
00:41:25,506 --> 00:41:26,810
- Really?
- Really.

667
00:41:29,577 --> 00:41:30,577
Cheers.

668
00:41:34,182 --> 00:41:37,750
I still cannot believe that we grew up
in the same town since we were younger,

669
00:41:37,752 --> 00:41:39,218
and I've never seen you
out riding your bike,

670
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,986
or out with a lemonade stand.

671
00:41:40,988 --> 00:41:42,488
And I would've
bought your lemonade.

672
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:44,957
No, you wouldn't have.
I don't like lemonade.

673
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:45,924
Who doesn't like lemonade?

674
00:41:45,926 --> 00:41:47,430
Me.

675
00:41:48,662 --> 00:41:50,142
You know I know
the real story, right?

676
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:54,767
You and your dad are in
the witness protection program.

677
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:57,089
And you have both testified
against a mobster.

678
00:41:58,272 --> 00:42:03,111
Very close,
but, uh, the truth is...

679
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,180
I've been sent here
to monitor you.

680
00:42:08,182 --> 00:42:12,785
Right, and I've been given specific
instructions to never be seen in the daylight,

681
00:42:12,787 --> 00:42:17,524
and I've been watching you this whole
entire time from the safety of my own room.

682
00:42:17,526 --> 00:42:20,759
Classic witness protection
program cover story.

683
00:42:22,531 --> 00:42:24,835
All right, close your eyes
and put your hands out.

684
00:42:28,303 --> 00:42:29,472
Okay.

685
00:42:32,673 --> 00:42:33,975
And open.

686
00:42:37,312 --> 00:42:39,248
- Try and catch 'em in your mouth.
- Hey.

687
00:42:42,684 --> 00:42:43,718
Thank you.

688
00:42:44,685 --> 00:42:46,718
Oh, and look. We're here.

689
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,116
Wait, where are you taking me?

690
00:43:15,015 --> 00:43:16,749
We're here.

691
00:43:16,751 --> 00:43:19,319
Charlie, what is this place?

692
00:43:19,321 --> 00:43:22,087
- It's your surprise.
- Charlie, my man.

693
00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:23,891
I thought Seattle
was my surprise.

694
00:43:25,225 --> 00:43:26,625
Come on.

695
00:43:26,627 --> 00:43:29,162
Where are we going?

696
00:43:38,205 --> 00:43:41,006
- It's your first live show.
- Yeah.

697
00:44:07,135 --> 00:44:08,236
Whoo!

698
00:44:09,037 --> 00:44:10,203
So cool.

699
00:44:10,205 --> 00:44:12,037
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

700
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:14,307
That was seriously so cool.

701
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:16,241
I know.

702
00:44:16,243 --> 00:44:19,779
That was, I mean, literally
one of the best things ever.

703
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:22,348
- Right?
- Oh, God.

704
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:24,987
Live music is beautiful.

705
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,654
You're beautiful.

706
00:44:27,656 --> 00:44:28,858
You're the best.

707
00:44:31,826 --> 00:44:33,928
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

708
00:44:36,064 --> 00:44:38,898
Okay. Your turn.

709
00:44:40,334 --> 00:44:41,703
For what?

710
00:44:44,104 --> 00:44:45,873
Oh!

711
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:47,339
No, no, no, no, no...

712
00:44:47,341 --> 00:44:49,778
- Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes...
- I am not...

713
00:44:51,011 --> 00:44:55,381
- You owe me a song.
- I can't do it... here.

714
00:44:55,383 --> 00:44:56,916
Yes, you can.

715
00:44:56,918 --> 00:44:58,950
Remember?
Live shows are the best.

716
00:44:58,952 --> 00:45:01,120
Are you hungry?
'Cause I'm hungry.

717
00:45:01,122 --> 00:45:02,889
And you're always hungry.

718
00:45:02,891 --> 00:45:08,928
Look, we can either have come
all the way to this new city,

719
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:11,868
underneath the stars
and you don't play me a song...

720
00:45:13,734 --> 00:45:16,638
or we can continue to have
the greatest night of our lives.

721
00:45:22,176 --> 00:45:24,046
I'll be right here watching.

722
00:45:30,251 --> 00:45:32,354
Go. Come on, we're waiting.

723
00:46:51,165 --> 00:46:52,167
She's good.

724
00:46:57,806 --> 00:47:00,105
Whoo!

725
00:47:37,044 --> 00:47:39,377
Okay, I probably would have
said you were good no matter what,

726
00:47:39,379 --> 00:47:43,082
but you were really,
really good.

727
00:47:43,084 --> 00:47:45,618
You know, you have to do
something with your music.

728
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:48,156
- No, I couldn't.
- You have to, Katie. It was amazing.

729
00:47:51,225 --> 00:47:53,024
Are you ready?

730
00:47:53,026 --> 00:47:54,961
For what?

731
00:47:54,963 --> 00:47:56,330
To go swimming.

732
00:47:57,932 --> 00:48:00,232
No, Katie, you know
I don't swim anymore.

733
00:48:00,234 --> 00:48:03,336
Yes, you do. You just
haven't swam in a while.

734
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:06,104
And I've never swam
in this water before,

735
00:48:06,106 --> 00:48:08,640
so you're gonna take me.

736
00:48:08,642 --> 00:48:10,044
Uh-huh.

737
00:48:11,379 --> 00:48:13,511
- Come on!
- No, I'm serious. I'm not swimming.

738
00:48:13,513 --> 00:48:15,647
But you made me sing
and I didn't want to.

739
00:48:15,649 --> 00:48:17,549
- That was totally different.
- No, it's not!

740
00:48:17,551 --> 00:48:20,889
Okay, do you have any idea
how cold that water is?

741
00:48:21,955 --> 00:48:23,258
Charlie.

742
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:28,261
We could've either come
all the way to the beach

743
00:48:28,263 --> 00:48:31,430
under the beautiful stars
and not go swimming,

744
00:48:31,432 --> 00:48:35,301
or we could
jump into that water

745
00:48:35,303 --> 00:48:38,169
and continue to make this
the best night of our lives.

746
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:40,608
- I don't have a swimsuit.
- Neither do I.

747
00:48:46,113 --> 00:48:47,348
Katie.

748
00:48:50,017 --> 00:48:51,017
You coming?

749
00:48:57,926 --> 00:48:58,994
Hurry up!

750
00:49:01,595 --> 00:49:03,231
Oh, my God. It's so cold.

751
00:49:07,368 --> 00:49:10,372
Put your arms forward
and then push.

752
00:49:12,707 --> 00:49:15,644
The breast stroke? It seems like a trick.

753
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,647
Kinda.

754
00:49:21,649 --> 00:49:25,487
See, this isn't so bad.
You don't hate the water.

755
00:49:29,222 --> 00:49:30,958
I don't hate anything
when I'm with you.

756
00:49:50,345 --> 00:49:52,665
<i>Have you thought any
more about your Berkeley spot?</i>

757
00:49:54,481 --> 00:49:56,017
No.

758
00:50:00,521 --> 00:50:03,689
You know, I just keep thinking
about after the surgery,

759
00:50:03,691 --> 00:50:05,426
when I couldn't swim.

760
00:50:09,497 --> 00:50:12,267
You know, I just realized
I didn't even know who I was.

761
00:50:14,002 --> 00:50:15,637
And neither
did anybody else.

762
00:50:18,772 --> 00:50:23,075
All these kids that I've been going
to school with for 15 years, they...

763
00:50:23,077 --> 00:50:25,113
they just saw me
as that guy in the pool.

764
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,720
I don't have to live
that life anymore.

765
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,055
You know...

766
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,192
you're not the guy
in the pool.

767
00:50:38,658 --> 00:50:43,298
But you're not the guy
that doesn't try either.

768
00:50:50,303 --> 00:50:54,343
Do everything you can
right now and then decide.

769
00:50:56,144 --> 00:50:58,146
'Cause now
is all that matters.

770
00:51:03,718 --> 00:51:05,450
You're right.

771
00:51:05,452 --> 00:51:07,088
Okay.

772
00:51:11,626 --> 00:51:13,526
Speaking of tomorrow morning,

773
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,629
ready for the greatest sunrise
on the planet?

774
00:51:20,068 --> 00:51:21,502
What?

775
00:51:23,806 --> 00:51:25,374
Charlie, what time is it?

776
00:51:29,609 --> 00:51:30,711
It's 4:50.

777
00:51:33,513 --> 00:51:35,383
It's not waterproof.

778
00:51:40,488 --> 00:51:42,187
- Oh, my God.
- What?

779
00:51:42,189 --> 00:51:43,756
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Katie, wait!

780
00:51:43,758 --> 00:51:44,858
- Shit.
- What are you doing?

781
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,528
- I need to go!
- Katie, wait! Katie!

782
00:51:51,164 --> 00:51:52,633
Katie!

783
00:51:56,804 --> 00:51:58,472
Shit.

784
00:52:07,147 --> 00:52:08,347
Hey, get in. Let me drive you.

785
00:52:10,618 --> 00:52:13,785
Go, Charlie, go!

786
00:52:13,787 --> 00:52:15,354
Katie!

787
00:52:15,356 --> 00:52:17,388
- What the hell is going on?
- You don't understand.

788
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:19,792
- You have to go as fast as you can!
- Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

789
00:52:19,794 --> 00:52:22,595
- Katie, what...
- Please just go, Charlie.

790
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,263
- You're scaring me.
- You have to speed! Faster!

791
00:52:24,265 --> 00:52:25,265
Okay, okay!

792
00:52:28,301 --> 00:52:29,303
Oh, my God.

793
00:52:30,271 --> 00:52:32,173
Katie!

794
00:52:32,907 --> 00:52:34,341
Katie!

795
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:39,147
Katie!

796
00:52:41,615 --> 00:52:43,484
Katie. Katie!

797
00:52:44,718 --> 00:52:47,319
Katie.

798
00:52:47,321 --> 00:52:49,254
Oh.

799
00:52:49,256 --> 00:52:51,156
Katie, will you please
just talk to me?

800
00:52:53,828 --> 00:52:55,896
- Katie, please, just talk to me!
- Hey!

801
00:52:55,898 --> 00:52:58,263
- Is she inside?
- Yes.

802
00:52:58,265 --> 00:52:59,733
Is she in there? Move!
Just move!

803
00:53:01,502 --> 00:53:03,669
- How could you let this happen to her?
- Let what happen?

804
00:53:03,671 --> 00:53:05,470
What happened?

805
00:53:05,472 --> 00:53:07,806
She not... tell you?

806
00:53:07,808 --> 00:53:11,410
- Tell me what? I have no idea what's going on!
- She's sick. She's sick.

807
00:53:11,412 --> 00:53:14,180
- What do you mean she's sick?
- She has XP.

808
00:53:14,182 --> 00:53:17,283
She can't go in the sun at all.
It can kill her. I'm sorry.

809
00:53:17,285 --> 00:53:19,754
Katie?

810
00:53:41,209 --> 00:53:44,542
This is a nice hospital.

811
00:53:44,544 --> 00:53:46,548
I bet they have
really good food.

812
00:53:49,216 --> 00:53:50,651
Katie Price?

813
00:53:51,785 --> 00:53:52,922
We're ready.

814
00:54:10,571 --> 00:54:12,674
It was like a second, if that.

815
00:54:13,842 --> 00:54:15,707
Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

816
00:54:15,709 --> 00:54:16,944
We're good, Mr. P.

817
00:54:21,582 --> 00:54:23,348
Hey.

818
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:24,685
Is she okay?

819
00:54:43,403 --> 00:54:45,770
Okay, Katie, you can sit up. Nurse
Jane will take you back outside.

820
00:54:45,772 --> 00:54:48,877
Um, actually, I wanna stay.

821
00:54:51,379 --> 00:54:55,346
Okay. The sunlight exposure
was minimal.

822
00:54:55,348 --> 00:54:58,651
The physical effects you're
seeing right now will heal.

823
00:54:58,653 --> 00:55:03,388
<i>But, as you know, XP generally lies
dormant until there's a triggering event.</i>

824
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:05,290
We won't know if
that's what this was

825
00:55:05,292 --> 00:55:07,812
until we get the results back from
your blood work and CT scans.

826
00:55:09,363 --> 00:55:11,397
And if this was
a triggering event?

827
00:55:11,399 --> 00:55:14,433
<i>We'll cross that bridge if we come to it.</i>

828
00:55:14,435 --> 00:55:16,567
<i>If you experience
any symptoms...</i>

829
00:55:16,569 --> 00:55:20,406
unexpected shaking, muscular
pain, loss of motor function,

830
00:55:20,408 --> 00:55:22,374
you need to let us know
immediately.

831
00:55:22,376 --> 00:55:24,913
Okay. I'm gonna go
get dressed now.

832
00:55:27,381 --> 00:55:30,716
I'm pretty busy during the day,
but I could be free at night.

833
00:55:32,687 --> 00:55:35,053
I can be free at night.

834
00:55:35,055 --> 00:55:36,790
<i>My dad's super protective.</i>

835
00:55:39,459 --> 00:55:41,426
What about UW?

836
00:55:41,428 --> 00:55:43,495
<i>What about the study? Have
they started the second phase?</i>

837
00:55:43,497 --> 00:55:46,033
I followed up with them
last week. No news yet.

838
00:55:48,468 --> 00:55:50,504
Okay. Thanks.

839
00:56:00,113 --> 00:56:02,050
All right, Charlie.
Let's get back to work.

840
00:56:20,533 --> 00:56:24,173
Look, I know I told you to play hard to get, but
you should at least see what he has to say.

841
00:56:31,077 --> 00:56:33,848
- He's asking if he can come over and talk to you.
- Don't.

842
00:56:35,515 --> 00:56:37,015
Please just delete them.

843
00:56:37,017 --> 00:56:38,750
Katie.

844
00:56:38,752 --> 00:56:42,154
Look, if I read them,
then I'm gonna reply,

845
00:56:42,156 --> 00:56:46,424
then he's gonna reply
and then we're gonna meet up.

846
00:56:46,426 --> 00:56:48,026
Which we can't.

847
00:56:48,028 --> 00:56:49,829
Why can't you? I...

848
00:56:49,831 --> 00:56:52,131
You don't have to be a martyr just
to protect Charlie's feelings.

849
00:56:52,133 --> 00:56:54,098
He's a big boy.
I'm sure he can handle it.

850
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,937
I can't handle it.
Okay?

851
00:56:59,673 --> 00:57:02,741
He's gonna get hurt, and I'm not
gonna be the one who hurts him.

852
00:57:02,743 --> 00:57:04,612
So, please, can you
just delete them?

853
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,452
Yeah. Okay.

854
00:57:56,696 --> 00:57:58,997
We should do
another set of tests.

855
00:57:58,999 --> 00:58:01,200
The results could
come back different.

856
00:58:01,202 --> 00:58:03,769
Her brain has begun to contract.

857
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,037
- Once the neural pathways...
- What about the study?

858
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:08,973
They shut it down, Jack.

859
00:58:08,975 --> 00:58:12,079
I found out this morning.
There's no funding.

860
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,026
No, I...

861
00:58:28,028 --> 00:58:30,531
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

862
00:58:34,702 --> 00:58:37,439
I mean, from the time
she was very young...

863
00:58:38,907 --> 00:58:40,575
no matter how much she...

864
00:58:42,176 --> 00:58:43,711
cried...

865
00:58:44,745 --> 00:58:46,882
or screamed or moaned...

866
00:58:47,915 --> 00:58:49,149
I wouldn't let her
go outside.

867
00:58:55,155 --> 00:58:57,524
I wouldn't let her
go to the park.

868
00:58:58,893 --> 00:59:02,160
I wouldn't even let her
go to the beach.

869
00:59:02,162 --> 00:59:04,629
And she begged me.

870
00:59:04,631 --> 00:59:06,166
She begged me...

871
00:59:09,636 --> 00:59:11,937
for things that
she had every right to.

872
00:59:11,939 --> 00:59:14,175
And I denied her
all of it.

873
00:59:15,276 --> 00:59:17,942
I mean, for what? Huh?

874
00:59:17,944 --> 00:59:20,582
For this? No.

875
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:40,566
XP is a disease that tends to
take the joy from a child's life.

876
00:59:40,568 --> 00:59:42,133
In all these years
I've treated Katie,

877
00:59:42,135 --> 00:59:45,102
she's never complained,
she's never sulked.

878
00:59:45,104 --> 00:59:47,175
She always sees
the good in things.

879
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:52,711
And the way
she talks about you?

880
00:59:52,713 --> 00:59:56,149
I've never seen a teenager
so openly adore her father.

881
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:01,924
You're a good father, Jack.

882
01:00:05,758 --> 01:00:06,961
How long?

883
01:00:08,261 --> 01:00:09,864
It's hard to say for sure.

884
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,846
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey, Dad.

885
01:01:34,848 --> 01:01:37,884
I'm starving.
Wanna get some Chinese?

886
01:01:37,886 --> 01:01:40,785
- Uh, "yuh."
- Is that a yeah?

887
01:01:40,787 --> 01:01:42,255
What are you doing?

888
01:01:43,691 --> 01:01:45,959
I'm starting you
an online dating profile.

889
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:48,729
- What?
- Yeah.

890
01:01:50,064 --> 01:01:52,964
Look, okay.
So, I have this photo of you,

891
01:01:52,966 --> 01:01:54,799
which I think your hair
looks better in.

892
01:01:54,802 --> 01:01:58,035
- But then in this one you have your camera.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

893
01:01:58,037 --> 01:02:00,907
- This is not happening.
- No, no, no. This <i>is</i> happening.

894
01:02:00,909 --> 01:02:02,809
Here, just take a seat.
Wanna help me write it?

895
01:02:02,811 --> 01:02:05,243
Oh, I don't know.

896
01:02:05,245 --> 01:02:08,446
Okay, uh,
here's what I have so far.

897
01:02:08,448 --> 01:02:12,950
- "World's greatest father and handsomest photographer."
- Oh, veto.

898
01:02:12,952 --> 01:02:15,153
"Looking for a fellow adventurer

899
01:02:15,155 --> 01:02:20,091
interested in art, photography and
nostalgia about the Supersonics."

900
01:02:20,093 --> 01:02:23,294
- Supersonics is good. That's important.
- I knew you would like that.

901
01:02:23,296 --> 01:02:27,300
- Um, "a partner in crime to travel the world with."
- I don't travel, honey.

902
01:02:28,769 --> 01:02:30,906
Uh, you will though.

903
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,909
All right,
we're not doing this.

904
01:02:36,911 --> 01:02:39,681
Please, please, please,
I want to.

905
01:02:43,117 --> 01:02:45,086
You lost Mom and now
you're gonna lose me too.

906
01:02:54,026 --> 01:02:57,028
No. No, there's
always a chance.

907
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:00,298
We've always known it's
a matter of when and not if.

908
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:05,205
So I really need you
to be selfish and...

909
01:03:06,939 --> 01:03:10,375
go out there and, you know,
take those beautiful photos

910
01:03:10,377 --> 01:03:12,310
and start traveling
the world again.

911
01:03:12,312 --> 01:03:15,279
- I want everyone to see your photos, Dad.
- Just stop.

912
01:03:15,281 --> 01:03:18,783
Okay, I can't...
I can't...

913
01:03:18,785 --> 01:03:20,787
I just want you...

914
01:03:22,488 --> 01:03:25,390
to promise me that you're
gonna take care of yourself.

915
01:03:25,392 --> 01:03:29,129
I really want you to have as happy
a life as the one you've given me.

916
01:03:30,263 --> 01:03:32,497
And try and find someone

917
01:03:32,499 --> 01:03:36,234
that you can share these
incredible adventures with.

918
01:03:36,236 --> 01:03:38,907
Because having someone...

919
01:03:42,376 --> 01:03:44,178
that's the best part.

920
01:03:45,578 --> 01:03:50,350
So please, just pick
a rando lady and take her out.

921
01:03:55,088 --> 01:03:56,922
Okay.

922
01:03:56,924 --> 01:03:58,291
Okay.

923
01:03:59,526 --> 01:04:01,529
- Promise me.
- I promise.

924
01:04:07,234 --> 01:04:08,871
Good.

925
01:04:12,305 --> 01:04:14,842
Now we can order Chinese food.

926
01:04:16,911 --> 01:04:20,111
- Come on!
- That was so a ball.

927
01:04:20,113 --> 01:04:22,980
That's... That's not even baseball.
I don't know what that is.

928
01:04:27,386 --> 01:04:32,026
Oh, food. Finally. What took them so long?

929
01:04:38,298 --> 01:04:41,900
Oh, my God.
Charlie's outside.

930
01:04:41,902 --> 01:04:44,102
I know. I called him.

931
01:04:44,104 --> 01:04:46,537
What? Why?

932
01:04:46,539 --> 01:04:48,041
Because...

933
01:04:50,176 --> 01:04:53,144
you said the best part was having
someone to share your adventures with.

934
01:04:53,146 --> 01:04:57,884
So, go talk to him.
Tell him the truth.

935
01:04:57,886 --> 01:05:00,417
He deserves that.

936
01:05:00,419 --> 01:05:02,155
And so do you.

937
01:05:09,997 --> 01:05:11,464
You exist.

938
01:05:13,066 --> 01:05:15,002
This time I was positive
I dreamt you.

939
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:20,171
Charlie, I'm so sorry.

940
01:05:20,173 --> 01:05:23,140
Katie, this isn't something you
can just not tell me.

941
01:05:23,142 --> 01:05:27,412
I'm so, so sorry
I didn't tell you.

942
01:05:27,414 --> 01:05:28,616
That's...

943
01:05:31,984 --> 01:05:36,390
unforgivable and
very selfish on my part.

944
01:05:39,526 --> 01:05:41,963
We were never gonna work.

945
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:44,999
But I wanted us to.

946
01:05:46,533 --> 01:05:49,036
You, me, we...

947
01:05:50,569 --> 01:05:53,039
we don't win in the end.

948
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,241
So...

949
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:57,645
So I'm saying good-bye,
Charlie.

950
01:06:01,113 --> 01:06:02,382
Good-bye.

951
01:06:10,057 --> 01:06:12,624
You know, that was the worst
break-up speech I've ever heard.

952
01:06:12,626 --> 01:06:16,194
- What?
- Yeah. Like a D-minus would be generous.

953
01:06:16,196 --> 01:06:18,595
Zeros from all the judges Katie.
It was a total flop.

954
01:06:18,597 --> 01:06:21,499
I've never done this before!
What do you expect?

955
01:06:23,102 --> 01:06:26,506
Seriously, Charlie.
We can't.

956
01:06:28,575 --> 01:06:30,176
We can.

957
01:06:39,118 --> 01:06:40,687
What I can't do...

958
01:06:42,055 --> 01:06:44,089
I can't stop being with you.

959
01:06:44,091 --> 01:06:47,491
Katie, I've done
my research on XP.

960
01:06:47,493 --> 01:06:50,261
I know what it is. I know
what you are going through.

961
01:06:50,263 --> 01:06:53,131
But we're not the couple
who doesn't try.

962
01:06:53,133 --> 01:06:55,368
You knew that before I did.

963
01:07:07,214 --> 01:07:09,513
You've changed my life, Katie.

964
01:07:09,515 --> 01:07:11,835
Okay, you can either just leave
me here on this porch or...

965
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:16,189
or we can have the best summer
of our lives.

966
01:07:18,591 --> 01:07:20,290
What's it gonna be?

967
01:08:08,107 --> 01:08:09,510
Go, Charlie! Push it!

968
01:08:12,778 --> 01:08:14,247
Go, Charlie!

969
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,789
That's it, Charlie! Come on!

970
01:08:26,293 --> 01:08:29,227
- Charlie, let's go!
- Whoo! Whoo!

971
01:08:29,229 --> 01:08:33,199
Go, Charlie!
Come on, Charlie! Go! Go!

972
01:08:38,471 --> 01:08:40,337
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

973
01:08:40,339 --> 01:08:42,808
Yeah!

974
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:44,544
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

975
01:08:46,579 --> 01:08:50,148
The Berkeley coach was impressed and
they promised to keep in touch.

976
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:53,617
In touch is good. They'll be in touch.
I'm so proud of you, honey.

977
01:08:53,619 --> 01:08:55,588
- Ahh.
- So good.

978
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:00,859
Hey, I'll be right back.

979
01:09:00,861 --> 01:09:02,229
Sure.

980
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:06,663
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hi.

981
01:09:06,665 --> 01:09:09,501
- The rumors are true. Congrats.
- Thank you.

982
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:12,173
- You were great in there.
- Thank you for letting Katie come.

983
01:09:13,205 --> 01:09:14,574
I couldn't
have stopped her.

984
01:09:15,675 --> 01:09:17,774
Mr. Price,

985
01:09:17,776 --> 01:09:19,496
would you mind if I took
Katie out tomorrow?

986
01:09:22,748 --> 01:09:24,682
Yeah.

987
01:09:24,684 --> 01:09:26,416
Yeah, I think
that'd be fine.

988
01:09:26,418 --> 01:09:27,587
Thank you.

989
01:10:06,893 --> 01:10:09,762
- Come on. Come on.
- I'm so confused. What are we...

990
01:10:18,605 --> 01:10:20,938
- What is this?
- It's for you.

991
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:23,241
- Is this Katie?
- Yeah.

992
01:10:23,243 --> 01:10:25,742
Let's do this.

993
01:10:25,744 --> 01:10:28,979
- No. Oh, my God, no.
- Katie. Katie, yes.

994
01:10:28,981 --> 01:10:30,715
- No, I can't. I can't.
- Yes, yes, yes. Yes.

995
01:10:30,717 --> 01:10:32,319
Yes.

996
01:10:34,287 --> 01:10:37,788
This is so crazy. How... How
did you even pay for this?

997
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:40,724
- Don't worry about it.
- Charlie, your truck money?

998
01:10:40,726 --> 01:10:42,860
- I can't let you...
- Katie, it's already done.

999
01:10:42,862 --> 01:10:47,935
Okay, you helped me figure out my
dreams and now it's payback time.

1000
01:10:49,936 --> 01:10:52,002
I can't play anymore.

1001
01:10:52,004 --> 01:10:54,175
Then just sing.

1002
01:11:01,816 --> 01:11:03,881
Whenever you're ready, Katie.

1003
01:11:03,883 --> 01:11:06,384
Let's lay one down.

1004
01:11:06,386 --> 01:11:07,822
Thank you.

1005
01:11:10,723 --> 01:11:12,724
How did you get this?

1006
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:15,727
Uh, this is the song I've been working on.

1007
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:17,964
Stole your notebook again.

1008
01:12:35,607 --> 01:12:36,878
- Oh.
- Oh, no.

1009
01:12:37,976 --> 01:12:39,811
Yeah, really good job.

1010
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:41,781
Let me count our chips.

1011
01:12:49,889 --> 01:12:52,659
- That one.
- That one?

1012
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,027
That's Charlinium,

1013
01:12:56,029 --> 01:13:00,598
because it is huge and powerful.

1014
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:04,102
And that one
is my favorite.

1015
01:13:04,104 --> 01:13:07,438
That one is Burritorium,

1016
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,543
because it's shaped
like a burrito.

1017
01:13:10,776 --> 01:13:12,943
That one is Procyon.

1018
01:13:12,945 --> 01:13:14,981
It's 11 light years away.

1019
01:13:16,449 --> 01:13:19,986
So we were seven
when that light was made.

1020
01:13:23,021 --> 01:13:27,660
That was, um, right around the time
you got your first skateboard.

1021
01:13:30,529 --> 01:13:31,529
What?

1022
01:13:34,967 --> 01:13:38,104
Charlie, that night we met
at the train station...

1023
01:13:39,772 --> 01:13:41,806
I already knew you.

1024
01:13:41,808 --> 01:13:43,676
Wh-What do you mean?

1025
01:13:45,578 --> 01:13:48,612
In elementary school,

1026
01:13:48,614 --> 01:13:52,983
you walked by window every day
on your way to swim practice.

1027
01:13:52,985 --> 01:13:56,453
And in fourth grade,

1028
01:13:56,455 --> 01:13:58,723
you started skateboarding.

1029
01:13:58,725 --> 01:14:04,728
And in sixth grade, you wore a
Ken Griffey Jr. jersey every day

1030
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:07,133
for, like, a month straight.

1031
01:14:08,635 --> 01:14:11,935
And in ninth grade,

1032
01:14:11,937 --> 01:14:14,639
you buzzed off all your hair.

1033
01:14:14,641 --> 01:14:16,174
Uhh!

1034
01:14:16,176 --> 01:14:17,711
And...

1035
01:14:22,614 --> 01:14:24,484
every day...

1036
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:29,623
I waited for you
to walk by my window...

1037
01:14:32,926 --> 01:14:35,529
and it was the best part
of my day.

1038
01:14:38,597 --> 01:14:40,501
If I had just looked up...

1039
01:14:43,101 --> 01:14:45,104
I could've been with you
this whole time.

1040
01:14:48,808 --> 01:14:49,943
You were.

1041
01:14:57,650 --> 01:14:58,786
I...

1042
01:15:00,153 --> 01:15:01,954
I love you, Charlie.

1043
01:15:06,124 --> 01:15:07,794
I love you too.

1044
01:15:11,763 --> 01:15:14,631
I can't believe you still
like me after that buzz cut.

1045
01:15:16,235 --> 01:15:18,873
It was so ugly.
Oh, my God.

1046
01:15:50,602 --> 01:15:52,871
Okay, there's some more chicken,
but I'm eating the rest of the noodles,

1047
01:15:52,873 --> 01:15:54,805
if no one wants them.

1048
01:15:54,807 --> 01:15:57,909
Okay. I'm gonna go to the marina.
I'll be back in an hour.

1049
01:15:57,911 --> 01:16:00,176
Someday I wanna see this
Beyoncé-worthy yacht you're cleaning.

1050
01:16:00,178 --> 01:16:02,013
Mm, you're gonna
miss your chance.

1051
01:16:02,015 --> 01:16:04,886
Owner's back tomorrow.
It's my last checkup.

1052
01:16:06,119 --> 01:16:08,255
- See you in an hour?
- Okay.

1053
01:16:11,089 --> 01:16:13,891
- I'll walk you out.
- All right. I'll see you.

1054
01:16:13,893 --> 01:16:16,093
<i>One of these days we can</i>

1055
01:16:16,095 --> 01:16:17,931
take her for a sail
around the harbor.

1056
01:16:19,598 --> 01:16:21,267
We can watch the sun set.

1057
01:16:23,904 --> 01:16:24,904
Wait.

1058
01:16:26,573 --> 01:16:29,240
I... I wanna go with him.

1059
01:16:29,242 --> 01:16:31,278
Go where, honey?

1060
01:16:32,278 --> 01:16:33,614
Out.

1061
01:16:34,614 --> 01:16:37,081
Sailing on the boat.

1062
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:39,953
I wanna go with him
on the boat. Now.

1063
01:16:45,123 --> 01:16:46,357
Honey.

1064
01:16:46,359 --> 01:16:49,029
- It'd be better if you just...
- Please, Dad.

1065
01:16:52,131 --> 01:16:53,767
Let me do this.

1066
01:16:59,638 --> 01:17:01,706
It's okay, Dad.

1067
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:03,811
I really want to.

1068
01:17:14,052 --> 01:17:15,752
Okay.

1069
01:18:42,875 --> 01:18:47,745
I've waited my whole life to feel this.

1070
01:21:18,129 --> 01:21:20,866
There he is.

1071
01:21:20,868 --> 01:21:23,000
Hey, Mr. Price.

1072
01:21:23,002 --> 01:21:25,102
Glad you made it by
before you took off.

1073
01:21:25,104 --> 01:21:27,537
Of course. I'm...
I'm actually leaving today.

1074
01:21:27,539 --> 01:21:29,072
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1075
01:21:29,074 --> 01:21:31,308
The first practice is
in a couple of days, so...

1076
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:33,544
- That's exciting!
- Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

1077
01:21:33,546 --> 01:21:36,447
Your coach sent me your schedule, so
I'm hoping to make it down for a meet.

1078
01:21:36,449 --> 01:21:39,319
But why would, uh, my coach
send you the schedule?

1079
01:21:41,087 --> 01:21:43,621
We stayed in touch, I guess,
uh, after Katie reached out.

1080
01:21:43,623 --> 01:21:46,357
- Katie reached out.
- Yeah.

1081
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:50,196
She called him. Told him that he
needed to take another look at you.

1082
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:53,429
Uh, no, Katie never told me.

1083
01:21:53,431 --> 01:21:55,398
You know what? Hold that
thought, all right?

1084
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,236
I got something for you.

1085
01:22:10,216 --> 01:22:11,618
She wanted you to have that.

1086
01:22:25,463 --> 01:22:26,868
I, uh...

1087
01:22:28,501 --> 01:22:31,104
I never said sorry.

1088
01:22:32,305 --> 01:22:35,939
I never apologized to you.

1089
01:22:35,941 --> 01:22:38,375
I should have never kept Katie
out that late and I...

1090
01:22:38,377 --> 01:22:39,880
Stop.

1091
01:22:41,012 --> 01:22:42,381
Stop!

1092
01:22:43,649 --> 01:22:46,253
It's nobody's fault.
Okay?

1093
01:22:49,221 --> 01:22:52,689
We knew from the
time that she was little

1094
01:22:52,691 --> 01:22:54,660
that every day
was gonna be a gift.

1095
01:22:56,428 --> 01:22:58,062
I should be thanking you.

1096
01:23:00,466 --> 01:23:02,669
All I ever wanted to do
was make her happy.

1097
01:23:04,503 --> 01:23:06,406
And you made her so happy.

1098
01:23:08,341 --> 01:23:09,341
Thank you.

1099
01:23:15,614 --> 01:23:18,285
- Good luck at school, son.

<i>Coming up next, we have
a song that is blowing up on YouTube</i>

1101
01:23:31,129 --> 01:23:33,397
<i>with over two million views
in just two weeks.</i>

1102
01:23:33,399 --> 01:23:35,398
<i>Get ready to hear it
all over the airwaves.</i>

1103
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,233
<i>Just remember
you heard it here first.</i>

1104
01:23:37,235 --> 01:23:40,069
<i>This is "Charlie's Song"
by Katie Price.</i>

1105
01:24:57,516 --> 01:25:01,218
Yes!

1106
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:04,621
Yes! Hey!

1107
01:25:04,623 --> 01:25:07,724
Hey, that's my girl! Hey, that's my girl!

1108
01:25:07,726 --> 01:25:10,527
Did you hear this? Put down the...
Put it down! Listen! Listen!

01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,173
<i>Dear, Charlie.</i>

1110
01:25:23,175 --> 01:25:29,112
<i>I've always been more comfortable writing
song lyrics than actual sentences.</i>

1111
01:25:29,114 --> 01:25:31,850
<i>There's no way I can articulate
what you've meant to me.</i>

1112
01:25:31,852 --> 01:25:34,718
<i>Since that moment
we first saw each other,</i>

1113
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:39,755
<i>or the joy you've brought me since
I first saw you outside my window.</i>

1114
01:25:39,757 --> 01:25:42,526
<i>Even though our time together
was short,</i>

1115
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:46,229
<i>the stars have been burning
for every moment of it.</i>

1116
01:25:46,231 --> 01:25:49,666
<i>And the light from those moments will be
shining down for the next thousand years.</i>

1117
01:25:53,807 --> 01:25:59,475
<i>I hope that somehow I'll be able
to look down and see you, Charlie,</i>

1118
01:25:59,477 --> 01:26:04,148
<i>and all of the incredible moments
just waiting for you out there.</i>

1119
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:05,715
<i>And if you need me,</i>

1120
01:26:05,717 --> 01:26:08,551
<i>all you have to do is look up.</i>

1121
01:26:08,553 --> 01:26:10,586
<i>And remember...</i>

1122
01:26:10,588 --> 01:26:12,156
<i>I love you.</i>
