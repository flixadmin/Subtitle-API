2
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,496
Come. It's gonna be fine.

3
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,582
Nothing is going to happen to you.

4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,418
Please...

5
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,587
Please...

6
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,697
No.

7
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,428
Take that with you.

8
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,802
- Careful.
- Yes, sir.

9
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,144
Were you shot?

10
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,335
No.

11
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,315
Get him out.

12
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,443
- You're scaring him.
- Out!

13
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,743
What happened last night...

14
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,536
someone pays.

15
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,749
We took care of Calderón,

16
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:13,086
but those fucking gringos
still knock on my door!

17
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,839
Where the fuck were the guards?

18
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,009
Where the fuck were our men?

19
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,598
How the fuck did they know where
you were, Dad? How the fuck...?

20
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,895
We have a rat.

21
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,064
An informant.

22
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,192
They found my ledger.

23
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,655
Hey, what about Enrique?

24
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,493
He was manning the checkpoint
when the cops came in.

25
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,375
Let's get inside.
Going once, going twice...

26
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,169
Girls, please.

27
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:40,298
No. You can't go out that way.
Please, no, sweetie.

28
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,053
Honey, let's go inside. Inside.

29
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,359
- Hello?
- Salcedo.

30
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,362
No one's seen you since the raid.
Where the fuck are you?

31
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,697
David.

32
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,413
I'm having some trouble
with my wife lately...

33
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,333
but I'm monitoring my radio.

34
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,878
- Have you talked to Enrique?
- Why?

35
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,550
We've been trying to reach him.
My father wants to talk to him.

36
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,637
Your dad wants to talk to Enrique?

37
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,598
Do you have any problem with that?

38
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:33,935
I'll find him.

39
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,020
Good. Bring him in.

40
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,189
And Salcedo, you come, too.

41
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,540
I stand by the operation,
Minister, as does General Serrano.

42
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,792
Who was in Bogotá at
the time of the raid,

43
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,211
while you and your men
were there for five hours,

44
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,463
drilling holes, breaking furniture.

45
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,674
We were one minute away from
getting Miguel Rodríguez.

46
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,925
But you did not.

47
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,054
I need you to hand over all intel,
including informants,

48
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,848
over to a special prosecutor.

49
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,060
And I'm afraid the DEA can no
longer be part of this operation.

50
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,812
- You're taking us off?
- Yes, I am.

51
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,232
Minister, we recovered
something from the house.

52
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,736
It's a ledger.

53
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,160
Cartel accounts, transactions,
going back years.

54
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,288
- What is this? I don't see names.
- It's coded.

55
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:39,542
It's bribes, money
laundering... cocaine sales.

56
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,546
- Cali's whole operation.
- That's right.

57
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,998
And do you have someone who can read it?

58
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:48,461
There are two possibilities.

59
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,720
There's the cartel accountant,
Guillermo Pallomari.

60
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,557
Yeah, but he's underground. Maybe worse.

61
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,186
And there's the money launderer
we extradited from Curaçao,

62
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,520
Franklin Jurado.

63
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,586
Jurado's the most important
witness to this case

64
00:08:02,593 --> 00:08:04,016
and he's in U.S. custody.

65
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,737
We're not handing him over
to a special prosecutor.

66
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,531
So you're welcome to keep
the ledger, Minister...

67
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,451
but we have the only
guy who can read it.

68
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:26,797
Then, Agent Peña, I suppose
you have to see this out.

69
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,053
- Ambassador.
- Minister.

70
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,776
You make my job a lot fucking
harder, you know that?

71
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:51,447
Now you told me the only way Jurado
talks is if you find his wife.

72
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,786
Do you have any idea where she is?

73
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,372
I know someone who might.

74
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,251
After the fall of Escobar,

75
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,069
Medellín went from being the most
dangerous city in Colombia...

76
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,422
to one of its safest.

77
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,467
This wasn't a result of the
end of cocaine trafficking.

78
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,302
That was alive and well.

79
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,972
It was due to the new
godfather of Medellín.

80
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:21,602
His name is Diego Murillo,
but you know him as Don Berna.

81
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,526
Did you find her?

82
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,321
Sure you don't want something?

83
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,074
- The picada here is the shit.
- You have what I asked for or not?

84
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,330
Pretty girl.

85
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,874
Long way from home.

86
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,340
Gotta be fucking kidding me.

87
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,853
I'm imagining the headline...

88
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:09,817
"American woman held hostage
in Colombian jungle." Fuck.

89
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,072
- Thanks for the info.
- Wait.

90
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,952
I'm going to help you
rescue the Barbie doll.

91
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:26,292
To do this job, we need to work
with some old friends of ours.

92
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,171
They can help us.

93
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,744
They know the terrain like
the back of their hand.

94
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,862
How to get in and out.

95
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,857
What's it going to cost?

96
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,026
Cheap.

97
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,905
You just have to make
me a promise, Peña.

98
00:10:56,697 --> 00:11:00,451
When my name pops up on
the DEA to-do list...

99
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,746
you pick up the phone and call me.

100
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,764
So I can be cautious and protect myself.

101
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,169
I see now.

102
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,507
A get-out-of-jail-free card.

103
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,552
Exactly.

104
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,182
To us, Peña.

105
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,645
Enrique!

106
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:30,766
Boss.

107
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,441
Open the door. Quick.

108
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,073
- Boss...
- What are you doing? Get in.

109
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,702
- What happened?
- David has been calling.

110
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,747
What for? He never called before.

111
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:51,377
- I wanted to talk to you first.
- Last night was a big fuck up.

112
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,796
You're in danger.
Pack a few things and let's go.

113
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,468
Jorge, I swear. I radioed in.

114
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,763
It doesn't matter, Enrique.
The DEA passed right in front of you.

115
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,891
I should just run, bro.

116
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,269
Like Córdova?

117
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,062
What? It doesn't matter!

118
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,441
Stay, run. It's the same fucking thing!

119
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,526
No matter what I do,
I'm a fucking dead man.

120
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,194
Nobody is going to die, you hear me?

121
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,697
Nobody is going to die.

122
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,951
But right now, let's just get
you to tomorrow, Enrique.

123
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,173
Keep paging him until he hits us back.

124
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,507
Nothing else we can do.

125
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:40,779
Fuck.

126
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,180
We should've arrested him.

127
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,142
You know, brought him in for
assault or something to save him.

128
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,312
Fuck. I hope we didn't
hang him out to dry.

129
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,940
I thought you didn't like him.

130
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,360
Yeah, doesn't mean I want him dead.

131
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,695
Why the fuck do I have to hide here?
I didn't do anything.

132
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,454
I know you didn't do anything.

133
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,707
This is David being an idiot.

134
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:18,130
But... trust me. Have some
patience. I'll handle it.

135
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,009
Jorge...

136
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,223
last week, when you told
me to not say anything...

137
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,810
- about the DEA and their safe house...
- Hey.

138
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,064
That has nothing to do with anything.
Why are you bringing this up?

139
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,982
Stay focused.

140
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,754
Sit down.

141
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,110
Sit down.

142
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,952
It's very important you do what I say.

143
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,079
Don't leave this room.

144
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,706
And don't call anyone.

145
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,044
Not your mother, your brother or
your girlfriend. No one. Understood?

146
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,340
Hey, look at me.

147
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,260
We'll get you through this.

148
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,971
I promise.

149
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,146
Thank you, Jorge.

150
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,941
Seriously.

151
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,450
- Jorge.
- Fercho, how's it going?

152
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,081
Don Miguel.

153
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,001
Where the fuck is Enrique, Jorge?

154
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,007
I left him messages at his
house, at the tap room,

155
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,134
but trust me, I'll find him.

156
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,095
Regardless of where he is,
you know him as well as me.

157
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,805
He's a man we can trust.

158
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,018
The thing is, Jorge,
I don't know Enrique.

159
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,438
Because I didn't hire him, you did.

160
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,650
No, Córdova hired him.
But that doesn't matter.

161
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,278
I don't like to make judgments
before I know all the facts,

162
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,155
and we don't know them, David.

163
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,033
I find that funny, you know?

164
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,746
Because lately,
you're missing too many facts.

165
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,624
More specifically,
about the fucking DEA, Jorge.

166
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,875
Huh?

167
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:19,518
When the DEA burst into the building,

168
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:22,081
I was six feet away from your dad.

169
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:23,782
Don Miguel,

170
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:28,093
I've been investigating and it
looks like Enrique did radio in.

171
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,972
I think the DEA is using a signal
to interfere with our radios.

172
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,069
Dad...

173
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,894
Dad, please.

174
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,146
It could be.

175
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,231
It could be.

176
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,817
But you know what, Jorge?

177
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:48,322
That doesn't explain how the DEA
knew where I was. Do you understand?

178
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:51,879
Yes, sir.

179
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,956
Someone sang and I want to
know who the fuck it was.

180
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,252
Find Enrique. Let's have
him speak for himself.

181
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,922
We fucking fix this once and for all.

182
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,530
- Hi, fellas.
- Sir.

183
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,864
Welcome.

184
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,116
Hello.

185
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,493
War makes for strange alliances,

186
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,286
putting you into business
with people that,

187
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,498
under other circumstances,
you wouldn't even shake hands with.

188
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,375
Great machine.

189
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,713
You people know how to build
a fucking assault chopper.

190
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,590
The same is true of your enemies.

191
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,551
They will unite when they need to.

192
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,722
FARC, or Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia,

193
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,975
were a guerrilla army
about 17,000 strong...

194
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,520
engaged in the longest civil
war in modern history.

195
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,775
And in the early days of that war,
how did they finance their struggle?

196
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,021
Kidnapping.

197
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,363
Wealthy Colombians would pay a ransom

198
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,741
to have their loved
ones returned unharmed.

199
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,161
So when the Cali cartel wanted
to keep someone on ice,

200
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,705
safely hidden somewhere in
the middle of the jungle,

201
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,415
they hired the pros.

202
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,251
For a hefty fee, of course.

203
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,795
Nice look, Berna.

204
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,048
You're coming on the raid?

205
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,050
Thanks, but no.

206
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,720
I'm coming to make sure all
goes well with our friends.

207
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,180
Look at me.

208
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,932
Do you think an important man like me...

209
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,729
is going to risk his life for
some gringo piece of ass?

210
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,612
You don't know how to take a joke.

211
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,431
I'll go in.

212
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,259
Sure.

213
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,010
But they go with you.

214
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,952
What about you, brother?
Are you trying to fuck us all or what?

215
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,203
Calm down, Gilberto.

216
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,206
Franklin Jurado's in U.S. custody.

217
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:48,961
You don't want to surrender,
and you let them get the goddamn ledger!

218
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:53,132
Since you were a kid, I had to tell
you what to do and what not to...

219
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,258
You know what, Gilberto?

220
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:58,762
Since you were a kid, you had a big
mouth. Why don't you just shut up?

221
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,100
He's fucking lost his mind.

222
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,103
All these acts of violence
in the North Valley

223
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,313
are straining our friends' patience.

224
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,608
Any surrender deal's
hanging by a thread.

225
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,527
Uncle Miguel has to see that.

226
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,946
I told him, no violence.

227
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,491
Is this all my fault?

228
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,495
Haven't I always done
what was best for him?

229
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,000
Franklin Jurado.

230
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,713
I need to reach out to Chepe. Or Pacho.

231
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,840
But how the fuck...?

232
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,926
There's no one else I
can trust with this.

233
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,803
Let's see...

234
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:43,807
Dad.

235
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,652
Nicolás...

236
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:01,700
I need you to get involved
in the Jurado situation.

237
00:20:13,548 --> 00:20:14,620
Hello.

238
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,549
Any news?

239
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,801
He has a girlfriend on
the other side of town.

240
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:24,932
Look, David, if Enrique was a rat,
he wouldn't be around anymore.

241
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,142
Ah... Thanks.

242
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,436
I think I'll wait here.

243
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,607
You know he's a mama's boy.
That fucker will be back.

244
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:36,944
So now what?

245
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,490
Now you go to Toro Negro.
Navegante's waiting for you.

246
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,575
He'll give you an
assignment from my father.

247
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,995
Why didn't he call me?

248
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,124
I'm going to explain something to you.

249
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:55,712
Until this is figured out,
you only talk to me. Understood?

250
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,674
Yes, sir.

251
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:05,180
Better get moving.
Navegante hates to wait.

252
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,955
Coming up to coordinates
Kirk 5-7, maneuver incoming.

253
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,792
Private militias not only
weren't illegal in Colombia,

254
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,043
they were encouraged.

255
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:39,506
A government program called
CONVIVIR was started in 1994.

256
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,842
And it authorized
private security forces

257
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,386
to take up arms against
the communist guerrillas.

258
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,641
A free pass for crimes against
humanity, sponsored by Uncle Sam.

259
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,811
Gentlemen. So good to see you again.

260
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,314
Third generation night vision goggles.

261
00:21:55,814 --> 00:22:00,819
The same ones the Americans used
in Operation Desert Shield.

262
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:07,451
Peña, can we keep them afterwards
as a contribution to the cause?

263
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,539
The Castaños ran the largest
private militia in Colombia.

264
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:16,960
Their AUC, or Autodefensas
Unidas de Colombia,

265
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,004
numbered in the tens of thousands.

266
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,299
Their victims...
in the hundreds of thousands.

267
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,384
Theirs was a perpetual war.

268
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,600
And if you're hunting communist
guerrillas in the jungle,

269
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:28,944
they were your only call.

270
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,434
This one has AFCS.

271
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,979
And the 701 engine. Hmm.

272
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,359
- Not like last time.
- Last time?

273
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,195
The CIA.

274
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,573
They had us out here hunting
commies on Christmas day.

275
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,409
- That's real dedication.
- It is God's work.

276
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,037
Merry Christmas.

277
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,641
My dad trusts him, but...
did you see him?

278
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,018
That son of a bitch
looks nervous, right?

279
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:19,481
Never stopped adjusting
the mirror, staring.

280
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,234
I kind of love how much
this motherfucker hates me.

281
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,155
Our man in Bogotá confirmed
there must be an informant.

282
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,365
Huh?

283
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:31,576
Salcedo has to be the one the
gringos are calling "Natalia."

284
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,412
I'm going to love killing
that motherfucker.

285
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:38,041
You know who else I am going
to kill? His arrogant wife.

286
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,877
I'm going to leave those
poor girls orphans.

287
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,420
Poor things.

288
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,713
You can adopt them.

289
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,299
You son of a bitch...

290
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,398
Answer.

291
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,737
This is Paola, leave a message.

292
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,072
Hello, love, it's me.

293
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,409
Paola, listen,
I need you to call me back.

294
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,077
It's very important.

295
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,060
3 NEW MESSAGES

296
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,062
DELETE?

297
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,939
CONFIRM

298
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,399
0 NEW MESSAGES

299
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,161
Take me to where you
stashed him, Jorge Salcedo.

300
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,582
Stashed who?

301
00:25:45,423 --> 00:25:46,583
Pallomari.

302
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,007
Are we taking him someplace?

303
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,009
Uh-uh.

304
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,594
I see.

305
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,109
What do you mean,
you're going to a meeting?

306
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,654
I have a business to run, Guillermo.

307
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,863
A meeting with who?

308
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,701
With Fredy. We're meeting a new client.

309
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:22,122
Fredy? Patricia, the police
almost caught Miguel yesterday.

310
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,207
For fuck's sake.

311
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,501
What's the problem?

312
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,004
You didn't tell them
where he was, did you?

313
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,423
- No.
- No. What are you worried about?

314
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,509
Miguel likes you.
That's what you always tell me.

315
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,553
Yes, but always within limits.

316
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,222
You're worrying too much, Guillermo.

317
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,934
They need you. You're the brains
behind the organization...

318
00:26:42,941 --> 00:26:44,723
None of that matters, Patricia,

319
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,732
none, if they decide not
to leave loose ends.

320
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,568
You're giving me a headache.

321
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,196
Listen to me.

322
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:59,826
My love, we have to get out
of here before it's too late.

323
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,215
It's just a couple hours.

324
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,679
Call me if there's a problem.

325
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,993
What is it, Jorge Salcedo?

326
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:48,249
What do we do if we find Pallomari's
family in the apartment?

327
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,836
Hope that we don't.

328
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,344
We'll need to be quick.
I have someplace to be.

329
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:07,560
The love of my life is in
town and we have a date.

330
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,731
That's great.

331
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,359
When was the last time you saw her?

332
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,277
Eight years.

333
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,823
Eight long years.

334
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,701
Why so long since last time you saw her?

335
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:27,580
You know, she was abroad.

336
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,750
- In Japan.
- Japan?

337
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,169
Working?

338
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,882
She fucked a police captain.

339
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,510
Then tried to turn me in.

340
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:44,639
All these years, I've been
hanging around her parents' house

341
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,474
waiting for her to come back.

342
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:52,522
People say things happen for a reason.
All I know is... she came back.

343
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,274
She came back.

344
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,948
Beautiful day. Right?

345
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,953
How many tents, give or take?

346
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,706
I think around 20.

347
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:14,169
The FARC arrange themselves in
staggered positions, two circles.

348
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:19,215
Then they always go for lookouts
in high places along the trails.

349
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,759
Sun sets in three hours.

350
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,429
As soon as they hear the chopper,
they're going to hide.

351
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:28,266
Generators, flashlights,
fires... everything.

352
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,769
Those rats have a lot
of practice hiding.

353
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:35,356
Once the lights go, they'll use
guidelines strung into the jungle.

354
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,985
They grab hold, follow ropes to safety.

355
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:44,324
Once we find one of those ropes...

356
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,871
It's a fucking slaughter.

357
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:50,955
Berna.

358
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,352
Look, I don't want a bloodbath.

359
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,854
Listen to me, Peña.

360
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,232
You want the girl...

361
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,984
there will be a body count.

362
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,903
This is a war zone.

363
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:26,825
But if you want, we can
still call this thing off.

364
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:31,955
I need to get her back.

365
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,835
Just to be clear...

366
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,713
something goes wrong...

367
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,843
you still keep your promise.

368
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:12,203
Hey, you talk to Pallomari,
try to keep him calm.

369
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,998
- Then I come in.
- Okay.

370
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,741
Pallomari.

371
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,717
Pallomari!

372
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,500
He's not here, of course.

373
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,881
No luggage.

374
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,511
Must've freaked out when
Miguel almost got caught.

375
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,433
You know, Pallomari, he's the smart one.

376
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,437
Guess that's why he's the accountant.

377
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,939
And not a thug.

378
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,110
Hey, Salcedo.

379
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,322
You'll need to find him.

380
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,991
Miguel gave this priority.
Do you understand?

381
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,169
I'll take care of it.

382
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,995
Let me know when you have him.

383
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,834
I need tonight for the
business I told you about.

384
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,795
Oh.

385
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:44,879
Sure.

386
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,550
Good luck then.

387
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,618
- Hey, it's me.
- Salcedo! Busy today.

388
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:16,736
Listen...

389
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,080
any chatter from Pallomari?

390
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,208
None I've heard. But we got him.

391
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,337
- Who?
- Enrique.

392
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,216
He called his brother, the idiot.

393
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,176
David's on his way to get him.

394
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,929
That's great news.

395
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,598
Miguel must be pleased.

396
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,588
- David?
- We have him.

397
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,382
Yes?

398
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,885
He showed up at the house?

399
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:17,555
Meet us at 11th & 614th.

400
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,694
You ever hear anything from Judy?

401
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,571
Not since you sold her out.

402
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,325
Who would've thought it, Javier?
Both of us, bosses.

403
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,952
They give you a nice place in Bogotá?

404
00:34:41,544 --> 00:34:42,573
It's good.

405
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,082
You should see my house.

406
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,659
I can take a shit in a different
bathroom every day of the week.

407
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:48,722
My wife loves it.

408
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,130
Your wife?

409
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,967
I'm a family man.

410
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,347
Bet you still live out of a suitcase.

411
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,934
Guess catching guys like me...

412
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,938
makes it all worth it. Right?

413
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,740
Don't forget the suitcase.

414
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,201
Keep going!

415
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,371
Come on. Let's go! Assume position!

416
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,470
Be advised, team: five minutes to LZ.

417
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,387
Let's see how our new toys work.

418
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,031
Get ready.

419
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,066
God bless America.

420
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,519
Ah... Our guest of honor's arrived.

421
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,400
What's going on here?

422
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,116
Jorge, you're going to have
to explain some things.

423
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,882
Alpha in position.

424
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,010
Tell him what you told us.

425
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:27,722
Huh?

426
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,807
Salcedo knew about the DEA.

427
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,102
You're going to talk to me
like a man, motherfucker.

428
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,730
Salcedo works with the DEA!

429
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,482
He knew the DEA was in Cali.

430
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,446
He knew where they were at
and he told me to watch them.

431
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:46,574
And he told me not to tell you.

432
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,185
Charlie in position.

433
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,296
Bravo in position.

434
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,717
Everyone's in position.
Rotor, force them to the north.

435
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,802
Copy that. We're going to push them out.

436
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,680
We're circling back.
Arriving in 30 seconds.

437
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,850
Is that true, Jorge?

438
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,557
Tell me.

439
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,520
Tell me.

440
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,190
Are you working with the DEA?

441
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,903
Sir... it's true I've been
successful tracking the DEA.

442
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,697
But saying that I knew where their
safe house is, that's absurd.

443
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,865
That's absurd.

444
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:31,452
Rotor ETA five seconds. We have visual.

445
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:44,256
FARC is on the move. They're going dark.

446
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,595
Peña, they have your girlfriend
in the southeast part of camp.

447
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,561
Let's move.

448
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,439
They're about to kill me
because of you, motherfucker!

449
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,526
That fucking son of a bitch is lying!

450
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,654
If you're looking for an
infiltrator, it's him, not me.

451
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,033
Shut up! Know what they're gonna do
to my family if you say that shit?

452
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,493
You son of a bitch!

453
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,745
Let go of me!
I'll kill you, motherfucker!

454
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,957
- Let it go, motherfucker!
- Sir, that bastard is lying!

455
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,001
What do you want me to say if
that's the truth, motherfucker?!

456
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,211
Cut the bullshit!

457
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,052
All right, men, let's get
these fireworks started.

458
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,889
And don't be pussies.
This is easy. Get ready.

459
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,934
This shit is on!

460
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,690
I'm tired of this, Dad.

461
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,358
Sir, no.

462
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,361
David, please. What is this?

463
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,197
- Sir, I have no idea...
- Dad...

464
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,958
What the fuck is that?

465
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,092
What the fuck is that?

466
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,053
Huh?

467
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,014
Is that you, motherfucker? Huh?

468
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,807
- No.
- What the fuck is that?

469
00:41:23,571 --> 00:41:25,378
- What the fuck is this?
- I don't know, sir.

470
00:41:25,385 --> 00:41:26,394
I've never seen that!

471
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,904
Sir, I swear I've never
seen that before.

472
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,909
Let's give those fucking
guerrillas a rain of bullets!

473
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,870
They're in the river! Give them lead!

474
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,999
Sir... it's a SkyPager.

475
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,584
It's American high-end tech.

476
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,962
- Don Miguel, please.
- Shut up.

477
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,215
- What the fuck does it say?
- Let's see.

478
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,218
These are messages in
English. He's your rat!

479
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,336
Motherfucker, you're
going to have my family

480
00:41:54,343 --> 00:41:56,281
killed dragging me into this!

481
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:57,973
It's not yours?

482
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,183
It's not yours, Enrique?

483
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:02,102
Sir, I swear I've never
seen that before.

484
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,356
I swear on my mom I've never
seen that before, Don Miguel.

485
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,941
Can they track us with this shit?

486
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,609
I think so, sir.

487
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,860
Motherfucker!

488
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,531
- No.
- Don't move.

489
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:17,993
- Please! Don Miguel, no!
- Don't move.

490
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,578
No! Let me go!

491
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:24,124
Tell the truth, motherfucker!

492
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,377
Salcedo, you motherfucker!

493
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,504
Ah! Don Miguel!

494
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,387
Look, Jorge.

495
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,180
Your friend.

496
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,644
- Christina.
- Don't. Don't.

497
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,688
Stay where you are.

498
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:46,786
Put the gun down!

499
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,232
Don't move.

500
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,943
- Stay still.
- Please.

501
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,371
One more step and...

502
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,589
The rat is dead.

503
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,098
What's wrong?

504
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,267
Start.

505
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:29,976
- Feistl.
- I have her.

506
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,192
Get Franklin ready.

507
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,546
Yes, I know my signature.

508
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,926
- Hi!
- Hi, Dad!

509
00:44:39,188 --> 00:44:40,280
Where's Mom?

510
00:44:41,051 --> 00:44:42,167
Jorge?

511
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,264
She doesn't want to see you.

512
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,225
Paola!

513
00:44:46,944 --> 00:44:47,990
Paola!

514
00:44:48,815 --> 00:44:49,826
Paola!

515
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,939
Have some respect.
This is my mom's house.

516
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,027
What's going on?

517
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:01,907
What is it?

518
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,495
What's going on?

519
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,331
Breathe.

520
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,170
What happened?

521
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,715
What's going on? Come here.

522
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,580
In less than an hour,
we're on that plane.

523
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,460
Your husband knows.

524
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,921
He'll be waiting for you.

525
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,761
It's all behind you now, Christina.

526
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:12,603
And you think I should
thank you for that?

527
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:15,899
No.

528
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,442
No, I don't.

529
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:24,698
No, you think you're a
hero because you, what,

530
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:27,910
executed a bunch of
farmers to get me out

531
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:30,579
so that my husband
would testify for you?

532
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,334
I did what I had to do and I'm
sorry for what happened to you.

533
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,256
No.

534
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,092
No, you're not.

535
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,928
And you know it.

536
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,806
You're a piece of shit.

537
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,940
- Salcedo?
- I know where Miguel is.

538
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,192
This needs to happen right now.

539
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,694
Yeah, of course.

540
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,655
Your code name for me? Natalia?

541
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:49,825
- What about it?
- They know. You have a leak.

542
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:52,035
The cartel knows about it.

543
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,496
It won't be long before
they know about me.

544
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:58,500
This needs to happen now or I'm dead.

545
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,806
Call for you. Number four.

546
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,657
Hello?

547
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,230
Hello?

548
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:22,434
Hello?

549
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,483
Brother.

550
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,029
That phone doesn't work.

551
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,615
Try number five.

552
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,125
You're Colombian.

553
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,377
Right?

554
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,213
I'm from Cali.

555
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:06,234
Hello?

556
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,445
Hello?

557
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,211
Yeah?

558
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,005
Hey... it's been taken care of.

559
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:42,990
Yeah?

560
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,775
Yeah, we're about to get on the
plane. We'll be in Miami...

561
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,325
When?

562
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,378
Let me call you back.
