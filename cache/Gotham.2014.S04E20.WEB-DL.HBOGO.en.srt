1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,160
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,400
What's you record for how many banks
you've robbed in one day?

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,360
You're playing a dangerous game,
Lee.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,240
My job is to make sure that
the people of the Narrows are safe.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,520
I will do everything
in my power to ensure that.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,800
I'm looking for Ed Nygma.

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,800
Five banks were robbed last night.

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,560
Why don't you try going
after the real criminals?

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,360
Making money off the backs
of the poor.

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,760
Like Gotham Savings and Loan?

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,920
- You are a fool!
- Come out with your hands up!

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,840
- I expected you might come, Captain.
- There's two of them.

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,480
What if he's nuttier
than the other one?

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,680
I'm nothing like Jerome.

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,600
I'm gonna drive you mad.

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,920
But don't worry, all of Gotham
will be joining you.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,280
- Hands up!
- Bombs away!

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,400
I'm more than a man. I'm an idea.

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,640
And I will live on in the shadows
within Gotham's discontent.

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,840
<i>Burn it down, brother.</i>

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,080
Brothers and sisters,

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,400
let's raise a glass
to our fallen leader.

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,040
To Jerome!

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,560
<i>To Jerome!</i>

25
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,200
This affair is invitation only.

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,640
Well, that's all right.
You're welcome to stay.

27
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,080
But you won't be leaving.

28
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
<i>Why so sad, bozos?</i>

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,120
<i>Did you think they could
get rid of me so easily?</i>

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,560
<i>Well, okay, so they did.</i>

31
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,720
<i>I'm dead.
But let's not dwell on negatives.</i>

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,520
<i>I have one last party to throw.</i>

33
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,080
First on the to-do list:

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,440
dig me up.

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
Dig me up!

36
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,880
Come on, clowns!

37
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,320
Dig him up!

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,600
Get Jerome!

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,760
We're gonna dig you up, Jerome!
You hear me?

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,960
Come on out of there!

41
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,400
Come on, dig, dig, dig!

42
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,920
{\an5}What are you gonna do?

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
{\an5}What can I do?

44
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,920
{\an5}The back door is just down
that hallway, right there.

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,720
{\an5}I'm not letting her go, Harvey.

46
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,360
{\an5}Why not? I'm the only one here,

47
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,680
{\an5}and I'm really good
at looking the other way, partner.

48
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,960
{\an5}Not this time.

49
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,800
{\an5}She robbed a dirty bank.

50
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,200
{\an5}People get away with a lot
worse in Gotham every day.

51
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
{\an5}Doesn't make it right.

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,640
{\an5}We got away with worse. Both of us.

53
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
- Get out of here.
- What?

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,840
I don't need that crap
thrown in my face right now.

55
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Get out of here!

56
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,440
{\an5}Well, you finally nabbed me, copper.

57
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,440
{\an5}What the hell, Lee?

58
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,560
{\an5}I don't suppose this is where anyone
expected our story to end.

59
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,480
{\an5}So it's ending?

60
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,560
{\an5}Hard to imagine what's left.

61
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
{\an5}I want to help you.

62
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,160
{\an5}- How?
- Give up Nygma,

63
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,360
{\an5}return the money,

64
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,200
{\an5}and ask the D.A.
for supervised probation.

65
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,480
I'm not betraying my friend.

66
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,080
They can call you The Doc.

67
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,560
{\an5}You can rob banks,
fight gangsters, but I know you.

68
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,160
{\an5}You're Lee Thompkins, and all this?
This is just a...

69
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,680
{\an5}...way of helping people.

70
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,280
I understand that.

71
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,840
Who doesn't want to be Robin Hood?

72
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,360
But you're still breaking the law.

73
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,600
Jim, you wish you could do
what I'm doing.

74
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,120
Helping people without
the straitjacket of the law,

75
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,720
as if the law means anything
in Gotham.

76
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,360
If the law has lost its meaning,

77
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,640
it's because people like you
are turning your back on it.

78
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,120
I am fighting back.

79
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,200
I don't deny anything I've done.

80
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,800
You want to send me to Blackgate?
Go ahead.

81
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,280
I don't want to send you
to Blackgate!

82
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,720
It's the last thing I wanna do.

83
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,960
Don't you know I wish I could let you
walk out that door, turn my head?

84
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,200
What's holding you back?

85
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,120
Maybe if you let me go,
you'd let yourself go too.

86
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,920
So many things I wish I could change.

87
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Things I've done.

88
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Jim?

89
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,920
Sorry to stick my face
in your business.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,040
Something just came up.

91
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,120
I've already inspected
it for booby traps. It's clear.

92
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,480
Well, that's a relief.

93
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,480
I've taken the liberty of setting up
a monitor in your office.

94
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,240
You don't think he might still
be alive, do you?

95
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,480
What were the autopsy results,
Lucius?

96
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
Dead when he came in.

97
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,480
More dead when he was eviscerated
and his brain was sliced up.

98
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,680
<i>Hello, Jimmy!</i>

99
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,080
<i>If you're watching this,</i>

100
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,240
<i>things must not have gone well
for me.</i>

101
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
<i>Shucks.</i>

102
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,520
<i>I can only pray I gave as good
as I got</i>

103
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,120
<i>and left ample carnage in my wake.</i>

104
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,000
<i>But I don't want to fixate
on disappointments.</i>

105
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,040
<i>Jimmy, I have one last
teensy request for you.</i>

106
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,400
<i>I want you to throw me a wake...</i>

107
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,320
<i>at the GCPD.</i>

108
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,280
<i>Don't worry about the guest list.</i>

109
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,240
<i>I've already sent the invitations.</i>

110
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,080
I don't like the sound of that.

111
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,760
Is everybody ready?

112
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,440
Lock down everything now.

113
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,880
Everybody, listen up! Lock it down!

114
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,440
Lock it down now!

115
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,640
The Doc's taken care of us.

116
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,400
It's time for us to take care of her!

117
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,200
Let's go down there
and bust her out of jail.

118
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,280
No one cares about the fate
of Lee Thompkins more than me.

119
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,640
Is that understood?

120
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,400
Which is exactly why
I will not have you

121
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
bumbling into the GCPD en masse.

122
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,760
So, we're gonna let her rot?

123
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,400
Leave her in the sweaty palms
of Jim Gordon?

124
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,600
I would sooner debate you all
on teleology versus deontology

125
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,560
than leave her
with that overgrown Boy Scout.

126
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,080
- Tele... What? Huh?
- Geez.

127
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,920
My point exactly.
Look, if I had it my way,

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,480
Jim Gordon would be
off the field of play

129
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,600
once and for all, but Lee insists
that I employ only non-lethal means.

130
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,600
So, I and my brilliant crack team

131
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,280
will liberate Lee Thompkins
with surgical precision.

132
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
You stay here.

133
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,080
Team, we have everything?

134
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,320
- Bicycle pump? Can opener?
- Right here.

135
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,680
Primer cord? Pickle jar?

136
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,800
Fishing rod?

137
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,800
Fabulous.
Okay, you four, you're with me.

138
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,160
You, go where Jim Gordon goes.

139
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,440
He comes under some harm, assist him.

140
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,680
I do not need Lee blaming me
if he's killed under friendly fire

141
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,480
while I go about my business. Okay?

142
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,320
All right, team. Follow my plan,
and we'll be back here

143
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,480
to finish counting this
in just a few hours. Keep it up.

144
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,200
Breaking Lee out's
gonna be a piece of cake.

145
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Hello? Wayne Manor.

146
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,760
Alfred, it's Gordon. Where's Bruce?

147
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,920
Well, he's meeting with Jeremiah
about the energy project.

148
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,520
<i>Something amiss?</i>

149
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,240
- He's meeting with Jeremiah Valeska?
- Yes, that's right.

150
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,600
Now, you can tell me
why you sound so concerned.

151
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,400
Jerome's followers are rampaging
outside the station.

152
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,680
Oh, I see.

153
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,120
Are Master Bruce
and Jeremiah in any danger?

154
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,160
It's hard to say. But right now,

155
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,920
Jeremiah's maze may actually be
the safest place for them.

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,840
Right. I shall head there
nonetheless.

157
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
Thank you very much.

158
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
What's the plan?

159
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,600
Open up the armory.

160
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,080
Now you're talking. Guys!

161
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,760
Jim, hey! Hey, Jim!

162
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,400
You figure out
where we're gonna hit 'em yet?

163
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,040
- We're not.
- Say what?

164
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,760
You know how Jerome works.

165
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,240
Dead or alive, he uses distractions.

166
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,640
So what? We're gonna
just let 'em come in

167
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,920
through the front door and party?

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,160
This wake is just intended
to distract us

169
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,880
while his followers
hit the real target.

170
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Which is?

171
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,320
Well, we're never gonna figure
that out

172
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,480
if we're inside fighting off
these maniacs, are we?

173
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,760
Look, they come in the front door,
right?

174
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,600
We fall back, get a few shots off,
make it look good.

175
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,560
Meanwhile, the entire precinct
sneaks out

176
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,560
this old service door
as quickly as possible.

177
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,960
I can't believe you're gonna
run away from these asses.

178
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,600
Once we're outside, we surround
the building, cordon it off.

179
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,520
- And then we trap 'em all inside.
- Correct.

180
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,920
They blow off some steam...

181
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,120
We hit 'em with tear gas
and knock a few heads.

182
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,280
Yeah.

183
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,640
Course, we still have to figure out
what the real target is.

184
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,920
Got a plan for that?

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,840
I do. It's a little sketchy
right now, but... Come on.

186
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,560
All right, listen up, people!

187
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Here's the plan.

188
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,560
Jeremiah,
I didn't think you could get

189
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,240
the generator program
working so quickly.

190
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,520
You ready for a demonstration?

191
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,920
Okay. You hit that switch there,
and the facility

192
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,600
will be disconnected
from the power grid.

193
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Ambient energy.

194
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,360
No cables or wires of any kind.

195
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,480
It's clean and stable.

196
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,920
Harvested from micro-tremors
and air density shifts. It's...

197
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,440
It's virtually without costs.

198
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,840
And with the prototypes
at Wayne Labs,

199
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,400
we could power all of Gotham?

200
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,280
You've kept this project a secret,
yes?

201
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,400
No one outside of Wayne Industries
knows it exists.

202
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,600
It's the ones who are closest to you

203
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,360
that you have to keep your eye on.

204
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
I know better than anyone.

205
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,960
Arkham Asylum sent me
Jerome's personal effects.

206
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
And amongst them,

207
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
I found his diary.

208
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,560
It's a catalog of his
fantasies and goals.

209
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,320
Every twisted vision he ever had.

210
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,120
Maybe you shouldn't spend
so much time reading it.

211
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,120
He was obsessed
with torturing and murdering me,

212
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,600
James Gordon, and you.

213
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,040
And if he had been
just the least bit sane,

214
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,240
he would have destroyed us all.

215
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,760
And Gotham would be in ruin.

216
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,120
Your brother is dead, Jeremiah.

217
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,560
It's time for you to come out
of this bunker and join the world.

218
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
Yes.

219
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Yes, he's dead.

220
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,800
I still have trouble believing it.

221
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Who is that?

222
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
It's just Alfred.

223
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,480
- Yeah?
<i>- Oh, Master Bruce,</i>

224
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,000
<i>I've got some rather disturbing news.</i>

225
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,800
Jerome Valeska's acolytes
are kicking off again.

226
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,560
Yes.

227
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
<i>Thank you, Alfred.</i>

228
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
I'm on my way.

229
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
Lunch plans.

230
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
That was a lie.

231
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,560
You're lying to me, Bruce?

232
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,120
You're right. I'm sorry.

233
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,520
It seems some of Jerome's followers
are causing trouble.

234
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
Oh, my God.

235
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
I was right.

236
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,560
No, Jeremiah...

237
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,560
I was right. He's not dead.

238
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,040
Bruce, he's not dead.
He's alive, and he's coming after me!

239
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
Jeremiah, easy. Easy.

240
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,720
You're not thinking clearly.

241
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
Come on, this isn't like you.

242
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Bruce.

243
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,600
Bruce, I need to tell you something.

244
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,520
After Jerome died,
he left one last final trap for me.

245
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,640
He sprayed me with his insanity gas.

246
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,040
"Special mixture,
just for you, brother," he said.

247
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,600
I can't stop seeing him...

248
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,560
...clawing his way out of his grave,
coming for me.

249
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,920
And even though
I know it's not real, it...

250
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
...feels real.

251
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,320
And I can't control myself.

252
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,440
What if I could show you
he's dead and buried?

253
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
How?

254
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,880
- We go there, to his grave.
- No.

255
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,320
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Jeremiah, listen to me.

256
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,680
Your brother took away
your greatest strength, your mind,

257
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,840
and turned it into a trap.

258
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,200
But if you can see the reality...

259
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,120
...you can be freed from that trap.

260
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,280
You really think that would work?

261
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
I do.

262
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,040
Then I'll try.

263
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,080
You're a good friend, Bruce.

264
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,800
We're getting you
and the other prisoners out of here.

265
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,320
What were you trying
to tell me before, Jim?

266
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,040
There's a van outside
waiting for transfer.

267
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
- Don't ignore me.
- I just want to get you safe first.

268
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,360
Come to the Narrows.

269
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
- What?
- Where you can make

270
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,920
a real difference in this city.

271
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,640
You can make up your own rules
about how to do it.

272
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,720
Alvarez, get them out of here.

273
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Go.

274
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,280
Don't shoot. Hold your fire.

275
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,520
There's too many of 'em! Fall back!

276
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Fall back!

277
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,040
Fall back!

278
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,200
That's him! He killed Jerome!

279
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,880
Gordon!

280
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,600
Stay together! Stay together!

281
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,640
Let's go! Let's go!

282
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,600
Well, look at us.

283
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,400
We caught ourselves
Captain James Gordon,

284
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,720
assassin of Jerome Valeska.

285
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Hi, guys.

286
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,320
Oh, don't try and get chummy with us,
Gordon.

287
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
We're gonna carve you up.

288
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,720
Yeah. No, I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to them.

289
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,120
Hey, man, you like to dance?

290
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,400
Let's, you and me, talk outside.
What do you say?

291
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,120
- Still, no answer.
- Then something's wrong.

292
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,680
- We should go.
- He was on his way to your office.

293
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
He'll wait for us there.

294
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
What was that?

295
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
We're almost there.

296
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,120
Just a quick look and we'll leave.

297
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Bruce.

298
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Bruce.

299
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,360
I don't know if I can do this.

300
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
Just a little further.

301
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,120
Oh, God, no.

302
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,000
His followers must have dug him up.

303
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,160
He's alive.

304
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
I knew it.

305
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,760
- We have to get out of here.
- I knew it.

306
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,600
He's alive!

307
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,320
Jeremiah! Jeremiah!

308
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,280
How much longer are these petty
aggressions going to continue?

309
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,520
There's nothing petty about
my aggression.

310
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,640
So, am I to starve until I guess
the source of your resentment?

311
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,400
You said, if I joined you,
we'd be back on top.

312
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,040
Instead, we're grubbing for Jerome
and we got played by Nygma.

313
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,320
You said, if I joined you,
you'd find me a cure.

314
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And yet...

315
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,720
I admit that,
through no fault of my own,

316
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,560
our advancement has not run apace.

317
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,760
Not run apace?

318
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,400
We're squatting in Falcone's
mansion!

319
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,160
We're knocking over liquor stores
to pay for groceries!

320
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,560
Meanwhile, everyone else
is carving up Sofia's territory.

321
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,160
We are lying in wait,
building a nest egg,

322
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,960
while less deliberate players
show us their cards.

323
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,400
If you don't find me Hugo Strange
and get me cured,

324
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,680
I am going to crush your windpipe
like a beer can.

325
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,960
- Did you just shush me?
- Shush!

326
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,120
I sense an opportunity here.

327
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,480
<i>...live to Jennifer Luree.</i>

328
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,240
{\an5}<i>In a twist that Jerome Valeska
himself could have thought of,</i>

329
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,240
{\an5}<i>the GCPD are laying siege
to Central Precinct</i>

330
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,560
<i>while Valeska's followers hold a wake
for their deceased role model.</i>

331
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,960
How is that an opportunity?

332
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,560
Confusion is always an opportunity
for the clear-headed.

333
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,680
Someone is showing their cards,
Butch.

334
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,680
Let's go take a peek.

335
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,720
At this time I cannot tell you...

336
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,640
You may recall what happened here
after the Arkham Asylum breakout...

337
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,680
One to the east, one to the west.
Let's go, let's go.

338
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,160
- Is he talking yet?
- I don't know. Let's check.

339
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,920
Long live Jerome!

340
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,680
All right. One more time, sunshine.

341
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,600
Did Jerome leave any other
instructions?

342
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
I'll never...

343
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
Harvey. Harvey.

344
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
Reporters, buddy.

345
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,240
All right, look,
this is how it's gonna go.

346
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,400
You're gonna start talking,

347
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,840
or I'm gonna stop caring
whether you can talk. You got it?

348
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,600
I'll talk!

349
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
I'll talk.

350
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
It's too late, anyways.

351
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,160
They're already dead.

352
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,240
Who? Who's dead?

353
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,640
Jeremiah and Bruce Wayne.

354
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,520
- You think he's telling the truth?
- I'm gonna find out.

355
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,040
They're at Jeremiah's bunker.

356
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,280
- You hold down the fort here?
- Long live, Jerome!

357
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,240
Long live Jerome!

358
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,400
- Trouble, Mr. Riddler?
- A complication, yes.

359
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,320
Hostiles take over the station.

360
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,080
Police will have removed
the prisoners.

361
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,160
Where are they?

362
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,880
Oh, yes.

363
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,920
Oh, this might be easier
than I expected.

364
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,120
The Riddler! We're saved!

365
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,240
- How did you get out?
- Through the old service door.

366
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,840
The old service door.

367
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
- What do we do now?
- Now, we improvise.

368
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,760
They're gonna use tear gas
in here soon.

369
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,000
I have to get in first.
We need a costume shop. Quick!

370
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,960
Penguin! We're saved!

371
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,040
- That one.
- Jerome...

372
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,840
No, not the...

373
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,560
You ever get tired of being wrong?

374
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Jerome is in the house!

375
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Jeremiah!

376
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,880
We need to leave! It's not safe!

377
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
You believe me now?

378
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
Jerome's alive.

379
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,640
No. His followers dug him up.
They're sick!

380
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,000
They're also dangerous
and they might be nearby.

381
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
How can I trust you
if you won't believe me?

382
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,040
You can trust me
because I'm your friend.

383
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,120
I want you to be my friend, Bruce.

384
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,000
You don't know what it was like...

385
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,680
...living underground
all those years.

386
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,000
And then you came along

387
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,800
and offered me everything
I could dream of.

388
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,240
Because I believe in you, Jeremiah.

389
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,080
We're gonna do great things
for Gotham.

390
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
We could.

391
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
We really could.

392
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,200
I thought we would.

393
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,640
There's no reason
to stop thinking that.

394
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,760
All we have to do is get out of here.

395
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,160
First, all we had to do
was come to the cemetery.

396
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,400
Now, all we have to do is leave?

397
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,760
See, that's very confusing to me.

398
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,840
So, tell me again, Bruce...

399
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,280
...why'd you really bring me here?

400
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
I thought it would help.

401
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,080
I was wrong, but we need to leave.

402
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,840
What the hell are you doing?

403
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,120
You think I didn't know
what was happening

404
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
from the moment
you suggested coming here?

405
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
Jeremiah, what are you talking about?

406
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,200
Stop pretending to be my friend!

407
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,040
I know what's really happening.

408
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,480
You can fool everyone else...

409
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,600
...but I know you made a switch.

410
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,560
And you can't hide,

411
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,840
not even behind
that new face of yours.

412
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,320
I know it's you.

413
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,320
I know it's you, Jerome.

414
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,840
Jeremiah, give me the gun.

415
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,840
Turn around, brother.

416
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,320
I said turn around!

417
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,160
You killed my friend Bruce.

418
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,360
Now it's time to put you back
in your grave.

419
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,480
Walk!

420
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
Come on, chug it.

421
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
Chug!

422
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,320
All the way! Yeah!

423
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
Wait.

424
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,640
Ed.

425
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,440
Bruce?

426
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
Jeremiah?

427
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,600
Just a little bit further, brother,

428
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,680
then you'll be back in your grave.

429
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,160
You're stronger than this, Jeremiah.

430
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,960
You know these ideas
are just the insanity gas talking.

431
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,920
I won't let your lies fool me
any longer!

432
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,640
What's happening?

433
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,280
<i>Hi-ya, Jimbo.</i>

434
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,360
Jerome.

435
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,160
<i>Don't bother talking to me.</i>

436
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,920
<i>This is a recorded message.
And, plus, I'm still dead.</i>

437
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,880
<i>Just more posthumous fun.</i>

438
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,840
<i>Look, I knew you'd see through
all those shenanigans at the station.</i>

439
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,440
<i>I'd given all my fans
a script for them to follow.</i>

440
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,480
<i>See?</i>

441
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,280
<i>I wanted to bring you here.</i>

442
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,680
Now do you believe
I'm not your brother?

443
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,920
Jeremiah, listen to me!

444
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,800
Jerome's followers are doing this!

445
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,200
Nothing else makes sense.

446
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,520
He sent them instructions
to torment you.

447
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
A fake.

448
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,240
Yes.

449
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,480
I can see quite clearly
where you cut off poor Bruce's face

450
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,480
and stitched on your own. But...

451
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,160
...I am a man of science.

452
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,240
So, let's have some evidence, huh?

453
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,920
<i>Don't mind her.</i>

454
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,880
<i>She's just here to make sure
there's no talking during the movie.</i>

455
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,360
<i>And trust me, you're gonna,
want to pay attention</i>

456
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,520
<i>so the twist makes sense at the end.</i>

457
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,640
Hold still, brother.

458
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,320
Let's peel off that grotesque facade.

459
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,400
Come on.

460
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,360
Ecco.

461
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,280
<i>I tell ya...</i>

462
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,120
<i>...suicide really takes it out
of a guy.</i>

463
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,480
<i>What is this?</i>

464
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,400
Jeremiah!
Do not let him turn you into him!

465
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,520
Do not let Jerome win this battle.

466
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,960
Jerome beat me?

467
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
That'll be the day.

468
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
No!

469
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,280
No!

470
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,360
Long live, Jerome!

471
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,640
Long live, Jerome! Long live, Jerome!

472
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,440
Jerome is victorious at last!

473
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,960
Jerome, victorious?

474
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,280
Are you serious?

475
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,480
He's dead.

476
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,800
Haven't you been paying attention?

477
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,000
<i>Thank God, I'm done with that.</i>

478
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,680
I am the one who's victorious.

479
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
<i>Jerome is dead.</i>

480
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,320
<i>...is dead, is dead.</i>

481
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,880
<i>Long live, long live me.</i>

482
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,880
<i>Long live, me.</i>

483
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,120
Look, Bruce.

484
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,920
Like everything Jerome set
his mind to, his insanity gas failed.

485
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,240
Other than some,
mild cosmetic effects,

486
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,080
he might as well
have sprayed me with water.

487
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,120
You all need to see Jerome
for the utter dud that he was.

488
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,400
So, I donned the mask of madness

489
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,800
to show you how feeble that is

490
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,400
compared to actual greatness.

491
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,960
Behold, the face of true sanity.

492
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,440
But looks aren't everything.

493
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,840
I have a compendium

494
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,880
of Jerome's obsessions and goals,
and...

495
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,400
...I will outdo every one of them.

496
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,560
Jerome wanted to turn Gotham
into a madhouse.

497
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,880
But to truly build something...

498
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,880
...you must first tear down
what is already there.

499
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,040
<i>I apologize for the deception, Jim.</i>

500
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,240
<i>I needed to ape Jerome
in order to persuade his followers</i>

501
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,840
<i>to throw that macabre celebration
at your police station.</i>

502
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,160
<i>They are a pathetic lot,
but not without their uses.</i>

503
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,880
<i>Sidebar.</i>

504
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,320
<i>That is a self-perpetuating
generator.</i>

505
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,440
<i>It can store a phenomenal amount
of energy.</i>

506
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,680
<i>I would hate to be within a mile
of it if it were to...</i>

507
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,720
<i>...overload.</i>

508
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,200
Jeremiah, the gas worked.

509
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,200
Think about it: you want to carry out
Jerome's crazy plan sanely?

510
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,960
- What could be madder than that?
- Madder?

511
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,520
Let's see.

512
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,120
Here, for example.

513
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,200
Jerome wanted to slather you in honey

514
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,560
and have you eaten alive
by corpse beetles.

515
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
Now, that's mad.

516
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,520
Me, if I want to kill you,
I'll just do it.

517
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,360
I'll shoot you in the head.

518
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,200
Simply and sanely.

519
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
Jeremiah.

520
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,320
But I don't want to kill you.

521
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,240
Come on!

522
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Are you gonna listen?

523
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,080
Or you gonna behave like children?

524
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,960
See, I don't want to kill you,

525
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,440
because I want to show you
how much I've changed things,

526
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,800
how much we've changed things.

527
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,000
'Cause I could not have done
any of this...

528
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
...without your help.

529
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,640
My help?

530
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,400
<i>That sound you are hearing...</i>

531
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,080
<i>...that is a very bad sound.</i>

532
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,760
<i>One which I'm afraid makes you
something of a guinea pig, Jim.</i>

533
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,520
I feel very indebted to you, Bruce.

534
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,360
See, those generators
that we built with your money...

535
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,800
...they work even better as bombs.

536
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,480
<i>Killing you will help secure
the loyalty of Jerome's minions,</i>

537
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,160
<i>...and, well, that is that.</i>

538
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,240
<i>Good-bye.</i>

539
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,360
All right, everybody, listen up!

540
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,880
You know what to do!
Let's go get our house back!

541
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,480
That's one down.

542
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,640
Jim Gordon is dead.

543
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,960
No! No!

544
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,920
Yes, Bruce.

545
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,760
Sorry, but progress
requires sacrifice.

546
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,320
I'm going to stop you.

547
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,920
I really hope you don't try.

548
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,760
I would hate to have to kill you.

549
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,960
In fact, I can honestly say...

550
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,280
...you are my very best friend.

551
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
What I want to know,

552
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,480
with a minimum of fuss,

553
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,400
is what you and your cohort
were really up to today.

554
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,120
I'll never betray the memory of...

555
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,080
Wouldn't dream of it.

556
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,920
I don't expect you to betray
the memory of that old corpse.

557
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,480
I want you to betray whomever it is
you are currently following.

558
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,240
Long live, Jerome.

559
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,160
He's not talking.

560
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,240
Is that so?

561
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,360
You staring at me?

562
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,240
Yeah, I get it.

563
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,560
Sometimes I...

564
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,840
...accidentally catch a glimpse
of myself in the mirror and...

565
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,920
...it scares me too.

566
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
And then I get angry.

567
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,960
The longer I'm like this,

568
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,360
the angrier I get.

569
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,800
And right now, the way I see it,

570
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,280
you are preventing me
from finding a cure.

571
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:11,200
And that, makes me very, very angry.

572
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,560
Is your plan to gain his sympathy
by reciting your tale of woe?

573
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,880
Nah. Just wanted to see
if I could get him

574
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,560
to pee his pants a little in terror.

575
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,640
You want me to shove some chicken
bones up his nose till he squawks?

576
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,000
Yes. That will do.

577
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,960
- No.
- Let's make this quick.

578
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,240
- No. No.
- Tilt your head back.

579
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,680
- Here comes the wishbone train!
- No. No, no, wait!

580
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,320
Smartest man in Gotham,

581
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,600
and you let your heart
do the thinking.

582
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,160
Wake up, Ed.

583
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,640
- Were you awake the whole time?
- Maybe.

584
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,160
Smartest man in Gotham, huh?

585
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,280
All right, get up. Up, up, up, up.

586
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,520
There are better things
to aspire to, you know.

587
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,120
I'm aspiring to them very much.

588
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,880
Just be yourself.

589
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,720
The guy who can let go
of the past and change.

590
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,680
I like that guy.

591
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,760
All right, now, how are we gonna
get past these psychos?

592
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,720
I'm assuming you brought
one of those for me?

593
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,080
Oh. Now, I would be into that,
but they only had one.

594
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,840
Instead...

595
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,000
...the cavalry should be coming
very soon.

596
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,080
Great.

597
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Round 'em up!

598
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,560
Move, move, move!

599
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,280
- Let's go, let's go.
- Go, go, go.

600
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,040
Okay.

601
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,760
Don't just wrap me
around your finger, Lee.

602
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,040
Come on. Let's run.

603
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,040
That's for taking a leak on my desk.

604
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,000
What a mess.

605
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,000
You know, it's funny.
It kind of reminds me

606
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,640
of my first apartment in Crown Point.

607
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
How long ago was that?

608
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,200
- I still live there.
- Harvey.

609
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,880
I found the epicenter
of that explosion.

610
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,920
It's Jeremiah's bunker.

611
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,640
That's where Jim was going
to look for Bruce.

612
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,280
Good evening, gentlemen.

613
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,480
Hey there, Mr. Valeska.

614
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,200
You alone, or you got Mr. Wayne
with you?

615
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,720
No Mr. Wayne.

616
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,240
But I'm not alone.

617
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,600
What the hell?

618
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,120
Look at these.

619
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,640
The gifts of true friendship.

620
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,960
Let's load them on the trucks.

621
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,720
It's time to give Gotham City
its new face.
