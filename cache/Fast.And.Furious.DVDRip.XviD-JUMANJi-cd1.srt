1
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,487
All right,
we're good to go.

2
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,356
You got this? You bet your ass, bubba.

3
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,863
Let's make some money!

4
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,233
Everyone in position.

5
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,906
I thought we'd be
robbing banks by now...

6
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:18,375
...not some gas truck
in the middle of nowhere.

7
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:21,107
Down here, gas is gold, bubba.

8
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,882
Kill the chatter!
Game time.

9
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,290
I wouldn't piss him off, guys.

10
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,215
Okay, guys, we're gonna have
to hit this hard and fast.

11
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,116
We got four K left
before the downgrade.

12
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,037
Locked and loaded!

13
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,961
This is all you, Han.

14
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,037
Liquid gold.

15
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,375
We're clear.

16
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:07,612
Okay, T, you're up.

17
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,717
Let's see if you can get it
under six tries this time, huh, T?

18
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:21,094
It's more like three. Come
on, Tego, keep it real.

19
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,278
Just one K left. We're running
out of road. Get in there, brother.

20
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,185
I got it, I got it.

21
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,625
Shit!

22
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,733
T, cut loose!
Unhitch, unhitch!

23
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,022
Spray that hitch!
I don't have a hammer!

24
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,580
Just do it!

25
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:08,604
Hold on! Hold on!

26
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,165
No shit!

27
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,539
Hold onto
something tight!

28
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,703
Letty!

29
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,036
Give me your hand!
I can't reach!

30
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,803
You got to jump!

31
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,196
Jump!

32
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,195
Letty, jump!

33
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,335
I've got you!

34
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,741
Dom...

35
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,276
Dom?

36
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,548
Dom!

37
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,885
How you doing?

38
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,155
Money, money!

39
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,660
Good.

40
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,203
Yo, why your stack
is bigger than mine always?

41
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,137
I'm supersized,
baby.

42
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,748
Cops just raided
our garage in Baracoa.

43
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,079
They were real
interested in you.

44
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,457
Heat's on and we just sent up a flare
that's gonna lead them right to us.

45
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,589
I say we move out first
thing in the morning.

46
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,025
Nah, it's me they want.

47
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,637
And if they catch me...

48
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,696
...they're throwing big
numbers at anybody with me.

49
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,845
Han, we had a good run.

50
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,578
Time for you to go
do your own thing.

51
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,514
Heard they're doing
some crazy shit in Tokyo.

52
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,731
Have you seen Letty?

53
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,109
There she is.

54
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,815
I hear Rio is nice
this time of year.

55
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,757
The cops are
getting hungrier.

56
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,262
Then I guess we're doing our job.

57
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,970
I'm a walking target.

58
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:08,836
I don't want you around
when they catch up to me.

59
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,443
"Ride or die,"
remember?

60
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,545
Dom, how long have we been doing this?

61
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,385
And now all of a sudden, out
of nowhere, it's too dangerous?

62
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,580
Come on.

63
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,657
We'll figure it out.
We always do.

64
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:01,899
I don't know shit!
Give me a name!

65
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,067
I don't know shit, man!
Give me a name!

66
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:07,135
David Park! David
Park's the guy you want!

67
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:08,839
Please!

68
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,855
Thank God. Listen, he's in a mood
because yesterday was his cheat day...

69
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,893
...and then today, some
genius brought in donuts.

70
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,189
Great.

71
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,123
Sorry I'm late.

72
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:31,767
Complaints keep rolling in after your
little downtown Olympics, O'Conner.

73
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:35,000
Tell me that reinstating
you wasn't a mistake.

74
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,271
I got a name. David Park. That's it?

75
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,812
That's all you got?
David Park?

76
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,781
I could throw a fortune cookie out this
window and hit 50 David Parks right now.

77
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,511
It's Korean, not Chinese. Whatever.

78
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:51,748
Park is a scout that recruits street
racers to be mules for the Braga cartel.

79
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,418
We find Park, and we bust the bad guys.

80
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,749
Dom.

81
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,481
Mia, I told you
not to call me here.

82
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,684
Dom, it's Letty.

83
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,490
She's been murdered.

84
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:48,670
We have gathered here to
pay our final respects to...

85
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,910
Let us reflect
on her journey...

86
00:15:55,654 --> 00:16:00,353
"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall
not want. He makes me lie down... "

87
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:23,010
Facial recognition software
matched Toretto...

88
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,913
...about 10 minutes after
he crossed the border.

89
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,513
I don't get it.

90
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,622
I thought he'd show.

91
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,176
I told you not to come.
They're staking the place out.

92
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,716
If they find you...
They won't.

93
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,716
Come on.
Look at you.

94
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,450
Letty wouldn't
let them junk it.

95
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,611
Even though it is
a goddamn curse.

96
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,360
When she came back,
she was always in here...

97
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,887
...working on it
day and night.

98
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,164
It was weird.

99
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:31,776
It was like she knew
you were coming back.

100
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,144
I want to see
the crash site.

101
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:45,211
I just got off the phone
with Deputy Director Lawson.

102
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:49,360
If we don't make serious inroads into
the Braga case in the next 72 hours...

103
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,692
...they're gonna
shut us down.

104
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,425
I know I'm a newbie here,
but why the clock now?

105
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,298
Because it's been
two years...

106
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,894
...and the last three agents we sent
to infiltrate his organization...

107
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,338
...came back in body bags.

108
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:07,003
He's moved more heroin across the
border than Escobar did in 10 years.

109
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,877
This guy is becoming one of
our biggest national threats...

110
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,041
...and we don't even
have a picture of him.

111
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:15,644
We don't have prints!
Not even a goddamn DOB!

112
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,885
What's the status
on David Park?

113
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,189
Isn't he our ticket into
the Braga organization?

114
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:27,062
We're running the name through city and
county databases, sorting the possibilities.

115
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,066
We've got
over 500 already.

116
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,194
Park's insignificant. Sounds
like another jerk-off to me.

117
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:36,264
It's not. Without Park, Braga wouldn't
have drivers to move his shipments.

118
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,105
Cross-check traffic.
Illegal modifications.

119
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,512
Street racing. This guy will definitely
have a record. We'll find him.

120
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,782
We better.

121
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,148
What do you know?

122
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,883
Your boy Toretto's red Chevelle has
been spotted in his old neighborhood.

123
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,788
I'm going to
bring his ass in.

124
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,089
Not in your car
you're not.

125
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,736
It's straight ahead.

126
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,829
You found something
back there.

127
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,332
There were burn marks
on the ground.

128
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,641
The kind that could only
be caused by nitrometh.

129
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:35,684
There's only one guy in
all of L.A. That sells that.

130
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,888
Nothing you can do is
gonna bring her back, Dom.

131
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,295
If I were Letty,
I would ask you...

132
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,927
No, I would beg you,
please, let this go.

133
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,162
Before it's too late.

134
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,611
It's already too late.

135
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,583
I love you.

136
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,043
Miss Toretto.

137
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,320
I'm Michael Stasiak, FBI.

138
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,418
Let's you and I
have a little chat.

139
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,816
Hi. This is Forsythe
in Evidence.

140
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:50,514
I need Stasiak down here right
away to sign some greenies.

141
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,113
Thanks.

142
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,748
Hi.
Hey.

143
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,385
Okay, I narrowed it down
to 50 or so David Parks.

144
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,861
What I'd like you to do is run the
make and model on each one of them.

145
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,919
All right?
Okay. All right.

146
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,226
Thank you.

147
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,175
Hey, Tyler,
we got a transfer.

148
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,373
You want to
come with me?

149
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,066
Toretto.

150
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:43,931
When'd you get
back in town?

151
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,910
I'm looking for a car
you did an engine mod on.

152
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:51,472
Nitromethane tank. Ford
full-size. Continental tires.

153
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:56,751
Look, what are you doing,
coming in here like this, huh?

154
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,951
This ain't your scene
anymore, boss.

155
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,755
Don't ever put your hands
on me again, okay?

156
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:05,159
Say hi to your
sister for me.

157
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:20,041
A Korean kid brought it in. David Park.

158
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,211
It's a green Ford Torino.

159
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,581
Please don't
drop this on me!

160
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,151
I'm almost done.

161
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,896
Why don't you tell me why
you dragged me here, Brian?

162
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:48,938
You know they're going to
capture Dom. Maybe worse.

163
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:54,908
I don't want you getting tangled
up in this. So stay away from him.

164
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:59,214
That's what you have to
say to me after five years?

165
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,452
All of a sudden, you
care what happens to me.

166
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,225
What I did to you
was wrong.

167
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:13,560
I'm sorry. It was... It was the
hardest thing I've ever had to do.

168
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,967
I'm sorry, too, Brian.

169
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:22,336
I'm so sorry that you had to come
into my home and pretend to love me.

170
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,807
I'm so sorry that you
ripped my family apart.

171
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:27,777
I'm very sorry that
that was hard for you.

172
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:33,108
I lied to you.

173
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,146
I lied to Dom.
I lied to everybody.

174
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:40,887
That's what I do best. It's
why the Feds recruited me.

175
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,926
Maybe you're lying
to yourself.

176
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:49,894
Maybe you're not the good guy
pretending to be a bad guy.

177
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:53,769
Maybe you're the bad guy
pretending to be the good guy.

178
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,965
You ever think about that?

179
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,099
Every day.

180
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,320
I always wondered...

181
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,358
...why did you let
my brother go that day?

182
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,354
I don't know.

183
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,675
Shit.

184
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:36,838
Brian!

185
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,941
I got the cross-checks on David Park
back and have a list of possibles.

186
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,452
What do you got? All right. A
45-year-old male in a '06 Scion...

187
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,613
...with three reckless driving tickets. No.

188
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,089
An '01 Chevy Tahoe.
No.

189
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:51,026
Two Mini Coopers, a '06
and a '07, a Toyota hybrid.

190
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,758
Hell no. A '98 Saturn, a '95 Sebring.

191
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,959
A '98 Nissan 240
with an illegal mod.

192
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,059
Wait. That's it.

193
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,696
What? The 240 with the illegal mod.

194
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:04,003
How do you know? 'Cause
that's something I'd drive.

195
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:29,899
Don't! Don't! Don't!

196
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:44,276
Green Torino,
running nitro.

197
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,911
Whose car?
I don't know, man.

198
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,977
I'm just the middleman. I
swear! I'm just the middleman!

199
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,521
Wait, wait, wait.

200
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,928
I don't know shit, man. I swear. I
just run cars for Braga, all right?

201
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,797
All I can do is get you in
the race! That's all I can do!

202
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,233
What race?

203
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,471
Help! Come on,
hold on!

204
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,910
Let me up, man!
Come on!

205
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,924
Come on, man, I don't
know shit! Just let me up!

206
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,154
I told you, you got to talk to Braga!

207
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,218
Bring him up, Dom.

208
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,993
God! Don't drop me!
That's all I know!

209
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,591
Bring him up.

210
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,160
You here to take
me in, O'Conner?

211
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:43,163
Shit! Shit!
Shut up!

212
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,773
Letty was my friend, too.

213
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,473
You weren't
anyone's friend.

214
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,675
Yo, can you guys talk about
this later? Now pull my ass up!

215
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,082
She was running for this guy,
Braga, and things went bad.

216
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,177
Please!

217
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,882
I'm going to
get these guys, Dom.

218
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,187
Now let me do my job
and bring him up.

219
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,727
I'm going to
kill this Braga.

220
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:06,857
God!

221
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:10,029
And anyone else
who gets in my way.

222
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,466
Hey!

223
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,698
Don't let go.

224
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:27,881
O'Conner!

225
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:33,284
O'Conner! If you ever release
a witness of mine again...

226
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:39,595
That's enough!
Don't touch me.

227
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,097
I'm fine!
That's enough.

228
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:44,396
You're through, O'Conner!
I said that's enough!

229
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,462
Stasiak, go get
yourself cleaned up.

230
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,768
What?
He hit me first! You...

231
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,866
This isn't
the Cub Scouts!

232
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:55,174
Now, go on! You're bleeding on my floor.

233
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:07,622
O'Conner, do you know the difference
between a cop and a criminal?

234
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:10,126
What?
One bad judgment call.

235
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,790
Keep your shit in line,
son.

236
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,498
Have a good time.

237
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,168
Take a seat.

238
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:32,742
Good news. We have intel that
Braga's number two, Ramon Campos...

239
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:35,012
...will hold a street race
in Koreatown tomorrow night...

240
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,213
...to fill a slot
on his team.

241
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,451
They've already chosen three
drivers from previous races.

242
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,087
Our newest informant,
Mr. David Park...

243
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,926
...has been kind enough
to get us into the race.

244
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,630
O'Conner, you're up.

245
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,030
Let me guess,
winner gets the slot.

246
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:03,342
All right, so these are all the
imports the city has in impound.

247
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,575
Okay, nice.
Pick your poison.

248
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,881
All right, 2206.
I crashed one of those.

249
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:13,583
3418 and 2765.

250
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,927
Okay, so which one
do you want?

251
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,690
I want them all.

252
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,490
Standard issue
tracking device.

253
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,495
Boss wants to know where
you are at all times.

254
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:46,210
You want to
play with it?

255
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,311
Hey!

256
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,153
What are you
looking at, nutsack?

257
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,985
I don't know.
You tell me.

258
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:55,321
The racer wants
what Dwight's got.

259
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,362
See, but, ladies, Dwight's
already on the team.

260
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,397
You got to be fast if you
want to drive for Braga.

261
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:03,298
Is there a problem here? No.

262
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,828
You one of
Park's guys, blondie?

263
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,395
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

264
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,608
Follow me.

265
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,743
See you later, punk.

266
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:18,709
You, too, punk.

267
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,222
Bull's-eye, coño,
come on!

268
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,497
We can do this all day.

269
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,042
You all know
why you're here.

270
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,203
Good drivers...

271
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,680
...are a dime a dozen.

272
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:58,384
Man, every corner's got a
chingadera tuner racing for pinks.

273
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:02,215
That's not what Braga
has got me looking for.

274
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:07,491
Braga wants someone that would sell
their abuelita to be behind the wheel.

275
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:13,162
Someone that drives their 10-second
cars not in a straight line...

276
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:17,469
...but to push it and make it through
places no one else would take it.

277
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,734
Real drivers.

278
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,938
So, what are we hauling?

279
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:28,385
For the money Braga's paying,
you don't need to know.

280
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:31,114
You just said you wanted real drivers.

281
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:36,288
A real driver knows
exactly what's in his car.

282
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,162
Mira, real driver...

283
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,231
...nobody's forcing you
to race.

284
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,068
You the boss?

285
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,105
Or am I talking
to the boss?

286
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,014
Do I look like a boss?

287
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,779
My job is to find the
best drivers, period.

288
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:07,483
Whoever wins the race
gets the info. We cool?

289
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,954
Are we cool?

290
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,828
Yeah, we're cool.

291
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:20,327
No,
we ain't cool, man.

292
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,233
Who's closing these streets?

293
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,602
No one.
That's the point.

294
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,754
Please wait while
directions are downloaded.

295
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,967
Proceed to
the highlighted route.

296
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:52,828
Ten...

297
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:55,766
...nine...

298
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:58,603
...eight...

299
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,506
...seven...

300
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,039
...six...

301
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,414
You sure you want to do
this? A lot has changed.

302
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,183
...four...
You're right.

303
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,250
...three...

304
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,951
...two...

305
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,620
...one...

306
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,190
...go!

307
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,268
Right turn ahead.

308
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:36,774
You are now five miles
from your destination.

309
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,604
How's my ass look,
Chia Pet?

310
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,001
Ghetto Smurf.

311
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,798
Dead man driving.

312
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:38,738
Come on!

313
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,807
Right turn ahead.

314
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:01,958
Shit!

315
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:08,568
Damn.

316
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,038
Rerouting.

317
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,480
Rerouting.

318
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,285
Proceed straight ahead.

319
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,962
Rerouting.

320
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,969
Shit.

321
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,640
Rerouting.
Just shut up!

322
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,852
You are 2.6 miles
from destination.

323
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,452
Oops, I didn't see you.

324
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:07,887
You are now four and one-half
miles from your destination.

325
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:43,498
U- Turn, if possible.
Are you kidding me?

326
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:47,628
You are now 4.2 miles
from your destination.

327
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,873
Sorry, car.

328
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,673
You are now one mile
from your destination.

329
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,946
Yeah,
guess who's back, Dom?

330
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,221
Let's go!

331
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,322
Nice car, baby!

332
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,203
Bitch!

333
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,605
You are now one-quarter
mile from your destination.

334
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,858
Too early, Dom.

335
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,144
No!

336
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,518
Still a buster.

337
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,054
You have reached your
destination. Goodbye.

338
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:08,142
At least we know you
can't beat me straight up.

339
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:10,043
I didn't know
there were any rules.

340
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,677
Now that's what I call
real driving.

341
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,150
No, that's bullshit, man!

342
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,187
Go cry to your mama, eh?

343
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:21,614
You work for Braga now.

344
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:24,824
When the GPS calls,
you follow.

345
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,630
Driver's license.

346
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:34,262
What driver's license?

347
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,362
Thumb.

348
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,842
Cell phone number.

349
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:50,113
The print is for Campos.

350
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,686
The number is for me.

351
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,525
Yo, nutsack!

352
00:44:57,594 --> 00:45:01,189
Let me tell you something, man,
muscle beats import every time.

353
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:04,063
You know what I'm saying? Every time!

354
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:07,961
Ladies, let's get on
back to Papa Dwight's.

355
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:17,671
Papa Dwight wants you
to take off your shoes.

356
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:21,284
Dwight likes feet.
Take off your shoes.

357
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,777
So beautiful.

358
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,880
Dwight likes this foot a lot.

359
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,599
Yes, baby!

360
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,964
Daddy Dwight loves...
FBI!

361
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:42,767
Hey! Yo,
what are you doing?

362
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,968
I didn't do nothing, man!
Dwight didn't do nothing!

363
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:48,511
Hey, no! Stay, stay! Where
you going? Bye, Dwight!

364
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,807
No, what did I do?

365
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:53,074
You're under arrest
for distribution of meth.

366
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:56,517
Meth? Dwight's never
touched that shit, bro!

367
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,611
Dwight has now.

368
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:00,088
Yo, that ain't mine! No!

369
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,318
You know that's never
gonna stick, right?

370
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:04,622
Yeah, it's not
supposed to.

371
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:09,298
Live it up!
Live it up!

372
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:06,278
Yeah, Corona.

373
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:10,658
That's too bad
about Dwight.

374
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:14,185
Having the Feds raid your house
the same night you make the team.

375
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:16,289
So unfortunate.

376
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:19,767
I wish I could say I was
surprised to see you here.

377
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:24,636
What's to stop someone from
telling them you're a cop?

378
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:28,474
Probably the same thing that's keeping me
from telling them why you're really here.

379
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:30,775
What up, fellows?
Hey, how you doing?

380
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,510
Great. You having a good
time? Yeah, a great time.

381
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:36,109
Come on, let's have a better time.

382
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:40,214
How's your car?
It took a nasty bump.

383
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,848
It'll be ready.

384
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:45,292
I also heard you just
got out of County.

385
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,920
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

386
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:49,027
You know a guy
named Jim Garcia?

387
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:53,126
Nah. Big place. Lots
of names, lots of faces.

388
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:57,698
And you, you're wanted by
a lot of people, homes.

389
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:00,368
Yeah, that kind of heat
can't be good for business.

390
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:03,379
Yeah, well, that depends
on how you look at things.

391
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,813
I go down, I do time.

392
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,545
I do real time.

393
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:14,148
I don't know about your other drivers, but
when I see flashing lights in my mirror...

394
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,714
I don't stop.

395
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:23,089
Do you know each other?
