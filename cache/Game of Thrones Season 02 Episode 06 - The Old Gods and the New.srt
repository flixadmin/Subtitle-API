I sent men over the walls

- Why?
- To take the castle.

All of you should do

My father has donned the
ancient crown of salt and rock

48

King of the Iron Islands.

You are all his subjects.

51

Bugger that.
I serve the Starks.

52
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:44,523
If you think you can
hold the North with this--

Maester Luwin,
send a raven to Pyke

59
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:02,249
informing my father
of my victory here

60
00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:04,852
and one to Deepwood Motte
to my sister.

61
00:05:04,886 --> 00:05:09,189
Inform her that she's
to bring 500 men to Winterfell.

sworn to serve the lord

65
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:19,665
I am.

66
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,567
I am the Lord
of Winterfell

67
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:23,535
as Bran just informed you.

68
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:27,173
Send the ravens.

69
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:31,377
My Lord.

70
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,150
My Lord Greyjoy.

71
00:05:36,184 --> 00:05:39,687
I see you've finally learned
how to address your betters.

72
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:41,256
What do you want?

73
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,558
I was brought here
a captive.

74
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,961
You were here the day
I was taken.

75
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:49,965
I'm the one who took you.
What of it?

76
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:52,701
Let me serve you.

77
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:55,337
Theon:
<i>Serve me how?</i>

78
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:57,839
I need fighters,
not kitchen sluts.

79
00:05:57,873 --> 00:06:00,875
It was Robb Stark who
put me in the kitchens.

80
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,445
Put a spear
in my hand again.

81
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,547
So you can bury it
in my neck?

82
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:07,149
Do you take me
for a fool?

83
00:06:07,183 --> 00:06:08,617
Get up.

84
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:11,720
Step aside.

85
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:14,022
Why?

86
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:17,493
It's your dream,
little Lord.

87
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:20,964
The ocean has come
to swallow this place.

88
00:06:20,998 --> 00:06:23,934
I ain't letting it
drown me.

89
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,770
- And in a few days' time--
- Rodrik: <i>Greyjoy!</i>

Woman: <i>What have they</i>
<i>done to him?</i>

91
00:06:33,911 --> 00:06:36,980
We caught this one on this way
back from Torrhen's Square.

92
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:39,949
Took out two of ours
before I got his sword.

93
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,419
Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that
we meet as foes.

94
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:47,290
It grieves me you've less honor
than a back alley whore.

95
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,793
You were raised here
under this roof.

96
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,496
- These people are your people.
- They are not my people.

97
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:55,732
King Robb thought of you
as a brother.

98
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:58,702
My brothers are dead.

99
00:06:58,736 --> 00:07:01,505
They died fighting
Stark men, men like you.

100
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:04,975
Aye, they died fighting
a war your father started.

101
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,244
Lord Stark raised you
among his own sons.

102
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:09,412
Among them,
but not one of them.

103
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:12,248
I was his hostage
taken from my home.

104
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:13,983
If he were alive
to see this--

105
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,852
He's not.
He's dead.

106
00:07:15,886 --> 00:07:17,954
The Seven Kingdoms
are at war.

107
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:20,256
And Winterfell is mine.

108
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,959
I should have put
a sword in your belly

109
00:07:22,993 --> 00:07:24,527
instead of
in your hand.

110
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:27,663
You've served this House
faithfully, old man.

111
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,766
But keep talking
and I'll--

( grunts )

113
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:34,604
Take him to the cells.
Lock him up--

114
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,340
My prince,

115
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:38,942
you cannot let that stand.
He must pay.

116
00:07:38,977 --> 00:07:40,877
I'll lock him in a cell
until he rots--

117
00:07:40,912 --> 00:07:43,914
No, he has to pay
the iron price.

118
00:07:43,948 --> 00:07:47,051
They'll never respect
you while he lives.

<i>( Thunder rumbles )</i>

I sentence you to death.

122
00:08:09,077 --> 00:08:11,544
No! You said no harm
would come to them if I yielded.

123
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:13,947
The old man couldn't
keep his mouth shut.

124
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:16,649
I urge you not to make
a hasty decision.

125
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:19,653
He disrespected me
in front of my men.

126
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:21,154
That was his decision,
not mine.

127
00:08:21,188 --> 00:08:23,656
He is worth more
to you alive than dead.

128
00:08:23,992 --> 00:08:26,993
The Starks will pay.

129
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:29,863
Please, Theon,

130
00:08:29,897 --> 00:08:31,831
think what you do.

131
00:08:42,475 --> 00:08:44,375
You'll address me

Stop! Stop right now!

141

00:10:18,573 --> 00:10:20,140
Jon:
<i>He's not a pet.</i>

160
00:10:20,175 --> 00:10:22,676
Qhorin: <i>You're right,</i>
<i>he's not.</i>

161
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,279
You can't tame
a wild thing.

162
00:10:25,313 --> 00:10:27,080
You can't trust
a wild thing.

163
00:10:27,115 --> 00:10:30,150
- Ghost is different.
- So you think.

164
00:10:30,184 --> 00:10:32,552
Wild creatures
have their own rules,

165
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:34,754
their own reasons.

166
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:36,757
And you'll never
know them.

167
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:40,460
Now the wildlings
we're looking for

168
00:10:40,495 --> 00:10:42,896
sleep during the day
and hunt at night.

169
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,901
I thought you said
you couldn't know wild things.

170
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,836
I said you can't.

171
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,906
They find a nice cave
to hide in while the sun's up

172
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,874
and do their killing
when it's dark.

173
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:57,944
- We could do the same.
- No, we couldn't.

174
00:10:57,979 --> 00:11:00,180
This is their country.

175
00:11:00,214 --> 00:11:03,250
They know where to walk,
where not to walk.

176
00:11:03,285 --> 00:11:05,186
I've lost good men
who fell into a crevasse

177
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,355
they didn't see
till they were in it.

178
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,959
My father always said
I'm of the North.

179
00:11:10,993 --> 00:11:12,760
( Chuckles )

180
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:15,663
- I wasn't joking.
- Look around, boy.

181
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:18,933
This look like
home to you?

182
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:22,170
You start thinking
you know this place, it'll kill you.

183
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:25,506
You understand me?

184
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,975
No, you don't.

185
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:29,943
We're at war.

186
00:11:29,978 --> 00:11:31,645
We've always been at war.

187
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,214
It's never going to end 'cause
we're not fighting an enemy.

188
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:37,818
We're fighting the North
and it's not going anywhere.

189
00:11:37,852 --> 00:11:40,854
The Watch has given
you a great gift.

190
00:11:40,888 --> 00:11:43,423
You only have one thing
to give in return--

191
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,891
your life.

192
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:46,259
I'll gladly give my life.

193
00:11:46,293 --> 00:11:48,661
I don't want you
to be glad about it.

194
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:50,696
I want you to curse
and fight

195
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:53,165
until your heart's
done pumping.

196
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,635
And know this, boy--

197
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:59,371
your death will be a gift
for them south of the Wall.

198
00:11:59,406 --> 00:12:01,606
They'll never know
what you've done.

199
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,141
They'll never know
how you died.

200
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:05,276
They won't even
know your damn name,

201
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,212
but they'll be alive because
some nameless bastard

202
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:11,883
north of the Wall
gave his life for theirs.

203
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:15,052
Now, do you understand me?

204
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:16,821
I do.

205
00:12:16,855 --> 00:12:19,223
You're even dumber
than you look.

206
00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:22,493
It's just words, boy,

207
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:24,495
to keep us a little
warmer in the night,

208
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:27,766
make us feel like
we've got a purpose.

209
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,235
( Laughs )
Come on.

210
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:32,604
We've got to find these
goat fuckers before night falls

211
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:34,218
and they find us.

212
00:12:45,888 --> 00:12:48,456
- Can you read?
- My Lord?

213
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:51,526
Can you read?

214
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:57,598
This letter detailing
our infantry movements

215
00:12:57,633 --> 00:13:00,301
was meant for Lord Damon
of House Marbrand.

216
00:13:00,336 --> 00:13:04,139
It was sent to Lord Marlyn
of House Dormand.

217
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:06,174
My apologies, My Lord.
I must have--

218
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:09,745
Girl, fetch me the "History of the
Greater and the Lesser Houses."

219
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,548
It's the one on the--
( Chuckles )

220
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,521
My cupbearer can read
better than you.

221
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:30,900
To whom does House Dormand
owe allegiance?

222
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,337
My Lord, I--

223
00:13:35,372 --> 00:13:38,174
To the Starks
of Winterfell!

224
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:42,411
Who have 20,000 men
and my son!

225
00:13:43,847 --> 00:13:45,948
I judged you might be
good for something more

226
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:48,550
than brutalizing peasants.

227
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:50,952
I see I overestimated you.

228
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:55,824
<i>If you ever put my son's</i>
<i>life at risk again, I'll...</i>

229
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:58,359
Leave us.

230
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:07,768
Put the book away, girl.

231
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:10,437
<i>( Door opens )</i>

232
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:13,006
<i>( Door closes )</i>

233
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:18,278
Maybe you should devise our next
battle plan while you're about it.

234
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:20,313
<i>( Knocking )</i>

235
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:22,949
<i>( Door opens )</i>

236
00:14:24,256 --> 00:14:26,474
- Lord Petyr Baelish.
- Hmmm.

237
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:29,456
Give us the room.

238
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:38,967
Clear all this.

239
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:44,907
- Lord Tywin.
- Baelish.

240
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:55,750
- Wine?
- Thank you.

241
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:00,588
What news
from the capital?

242
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:04,024
I travelled here directly
from Renly Baratheon's camp.

243
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:06,226
Ah, the late king Renly.

244
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,462
Rather a short reign.

245
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:10,498
Murdered by a woman,
I hear.

246
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:12,467
So they say.

247
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:17,640
There has been talk
of other forces at work,

248
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:20,109
dark forces.

249
00:15:20,144 --> 00:15:22,546
Here.

250
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:26,951
( Scoffs )
Men love to blame demons

251
00:15:26,985 --> 00:15:30,721
when their grand plans
unravel.

252
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:33,557
It is my belief
that a moment of chaos

253
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:35,993
affords opportunities
lost soon after.

254
00:15:36,027 --> 00:15:39,163
You say that as if you were
the first man alive to think it.

255
00:15:39,197 --> 00:15:42,332
Yes, a crisis
is an opportunity.

256
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:44,834
What other brilliant insights
have you brought me today?

257
00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:46,569
After the Lannisters
and the Starks,

258
00:15:46,603 --> 00:15:49,038
the Tyrells command
the largest host.

259
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,208
Their lands are the most
fertile in the Seven Kingdoms,

260
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:55,178
- feeding horses and soldiers.
- Yes, yes, yes.

261
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:59,617
The Tyrells have not yet declared
for any of the surviving kings.

262
00:15:59,652 --> 00:16:02,821
Loras wants revenge. He blames
Stannis for Renly's death.

263
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:05,524
And Margaery--

264
00:16:05,558 --> 00:16:07,327
Wants to be queen.

265
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:10,162
Yes, she does.

266
00:16:11,464 --> 00:16:15,235
House Tyrell rebelled
against the Iron Throne,

267
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:18,839
- against my grandson.
- They did.

268
00:16:18,873 --> 00:16:21,208
And perhaps that treason
should be punished

269
00:16:21,242 --> 00:16:23,144
<i>one day,</i>

270
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:27,147
after Stannis and Robb Stark
are defeated.

271
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:31,752
More wine for Lord Baelish.

272
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:41,128
If you will allow me to represent
your family's interests,

273
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:43,229
I believe that an advantageous
agreement--

274
00:16:43,264 --> 00:16:46,332
The Tyrell host has
returned to Highgarden?

275
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:48,534
They have.

276
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:50,469
Pardon, My Lord.

277
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:52,438
It's only wine.

278
00:16:53,807 --> 00:16:55,941
You would ride
there yourself?

279
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:57,876
Tonight, with your leave.

280
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,144
I'll have an answer
by nightfall.

281
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:01,846
That'll be all, girl.

282
00:17:07,452 --> 00:17:08,987
What else?

283
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:11,155
On your son
Tyrion's directive,

284
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,691
I met with Catelyn Stark.

285
00:17:13,726 --> 00:17:15,226
Why?

286
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:17,763
Littlefinger: <i>He had an interesting</i>
<i>proposal for her</i>

287
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:21,000
- concerning her daughters.
- Hmm.

288
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,863
- ( Groans )
- ( Shouting )

289
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:13,419
- A girl.
- A wildling.

290
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:15,855
We could question her.

291
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:17,857
You could.

292
00:18:17,892 --> 00:18:19,492
She won't answer.

293
00:18:19,527 --> 00:18:22,996
I've known a wildling to bite off
his tongue instead of talking.

294
00:18:24,432 --> 00:18:27,233
- What's your name?
- Ygritte.

295
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:30,336
She was reaching for this axe
when you got to her.

296
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:34,107
Give her half a chance,
she'll bury it in your face.

297
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:36,943
I gave you my name.

298
00:18:38,045 --> 00:18:40,713
I'm Jon Snow.

299
00:18:47,186 --> 00:18:49,121
You ought to burn
them you killed.

300
00:18:49,156 --> 00:18:51,824
Qhorin: <i>We'd need a big</i>
<i>fire for that.</i>

301
00:18:51,858 --> 00:18:55,862
Tell me, Ygritte,

302
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:57,931
why do you want us
to build a big fire?

303
00:18:57,965 --> 00:19:01,202
Are there some more
friends in the area?

304
00:19:01,236 --> 00:19:04,572
Burn them or maybe you'll
need those swords again.

305
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:07,142
Our boy here's already
killed one dead man.

306
00:19:07,176 --> 00:19:09,577
He can do it again
if he has to.

307
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:12,179
What waits
beyond the pass?

308
00:19:12,214 --> 00:19:14,248
- The free folk.
- How many?

309
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:16,150
( Chuckles )

310
00:19:16,184 --> 00:19:18,118
Hundreds and thousands.

311
00:19:18,153 --> 00:19:20,688
More than you've
ever seen, crow.

312
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:24,124
Why come to the mountains?

313
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,095
What's in the Frostfangs
your king could want?

314
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:37,039
Do you mean to march
on the Wall?

315
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:44,782
Do you know
who I am, girl?

316

00:29:53,523 --> 00:29:56,758
Of course, you could have
avoided this embarrassment

478
00:29:56,793 --> 00:29:59,261
if you married
the wealthiest man in Qarth.

479
00:29:59,295 --> 00:30:01,330
I already have a husband.

480
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:03,699
Khal Drogo is gone,
Khaleesi.

481
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:07,603
You are far too young
to be a widow forever

482
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:09,939
and far too beautiful.

483
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,741
And you are far too smart

484
00:30:11,775 --> 00:30:15,244
to think that I will
succumb to flattery.

485
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,213
I have travelled
very far in my life

486
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,949
and met many women,

487
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,784
but none that are
immune to flattery.

488
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:23,520
- <i>The Mother of Dragons!</i>
- Ah.

489
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,555
Here he comes.

490
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:29,192
Forgive me. I had terrible
dreams last night.

491
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,861
Terrible dreams.

492
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:34,064
I could not sleep
until the sun was shining

493
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:36,600
and the birds were singing.

494
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:39,369
<i>Look what a beauty you are</i>

495
00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:41,971
<i>now the Red Waste</i>
<i>has been washed off you.</i>

496
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:45,341
I am sorry about
all that unpleasantness.

497
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:49,845
The silver hair
of a true Targaryen.

498
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,316
Xaro Xhoan Daxos,
she is far too lovely

499
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,886
for a glorified
dockworker like yourself.

500
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,456
Very true, and yet they say
that your grandfather,

501
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,558
who sold pepper
off the back of a wagon,

502
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,995
married a lady far lovelier
and higher born than himself.

503
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,263
Every lady alive
was lovelier

504
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:09,532
and higher born
than my grandfather.

505
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,400
- ( Laughs )
- Daenerys: <i>Ahem.</i>

506
00:31:11,435 --> 00:31:14,970
Did my servants not offer you
something to eat, to drink?

507
00:31:15,005 --> 00:31:16,939
I'll have them flogged
in the square.

508
00:31:16,973 --> 00:31:18,907
Thank you, My Lord.
You are a gracious host,

509
00:31:18,942 --> 00:31:21,843
but there is no servant alive
that can bring me what I want.

510
00:31:21,877 --> 00:31:24,679
Oh, she has a talent
for drama, this one.

511
00:31:24,713 --> 00:31:28,817
So, my little princess,
what is it you want?

512
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:30,285
My birthright--

513
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,221
the Seven Kingdoms
of Westeros.

514
00:31:32,255 --> 00:31:34,924
I fear I'm no better than
a servant in this regard.

515
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:37,026
I cannot give you
what I do not have.

516
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,663
I'm not asking you
for the Kingdoms.

517
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,465
I'm asking you
for ships.

518
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,134
I need to cross
the Narrow Sea.

519
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:45,036
I need my ships as well.

520
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,537
I use them, you see,

521
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:49,040
to bring spices from
one port to another.

522
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,574
Whatever you grant me
now will be repaid

523
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:53,378
three times over when
I retake the Iron Throne.

524
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,846
Retake?

525
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,014
Did you once sit
on the Iron Throne?

526
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:59,884
My father sat there
before he was murdered.

527
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,286
But if you did not
sit on it yourself,

528
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:05,757
would it not be correct
to say take the Iron Throne?

529
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,825
I didn't come here
to argue grammar.

530
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,728
Of course not.
You came to take my ships.

531
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,330
So let me explain
my position,

532
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:15,299
little princess.

533
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:18,802
Unlike you, I do not
have exalted ancestors.

534
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:20,805
I make my living by trade.

535
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:24,174
And I judge every trade
on its merits.

536
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:25,842
You ask for ships.

537
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,912
You say I shall be
repaid triple.

538
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:31,748
I do not doubt your honesty
or your intentions.

539
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:34,017
But before you
repay your debts,

540
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:36,652
you must seize
the Seven Kingdoms.

541
00:32:36,687 --> 00:32:39,354
- Do you have an army?
- Not yet.

542
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:40,856
You do not have an army.

543
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,991
Do you have powerful
allies in Westeros?

544
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:45,160
There are many there
that support my claim.

545
00:32:45,195 --> 00:32:46,662
When were you
there last?

546
00:32:47,664 --> 00:32:49,298
I left when
I was a baby.

547
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:52,235
So, in truth,
you have no allies.

548
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,025
The people will rise
to fight for their rightful

549
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,740
Queen when I return.

550
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,609
Ah.

551
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,411
Forgive me,
little princess,

552
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:03,882
but I cannot make an investment
based on wishes and dreams.

553
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:05,383
Now if you'll pardon me.

554
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:08,119
Do you know Illyrio Mopatis,
Magister of Pentos?

555
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,789
Yes, we've met.
A shrewd man.

556
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:14,425
For my wedding he gave me
three petrified dragon eggs.

557
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,328
<i>He believed--</i>
<i>the world believed--</i>

558
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,296
that the ages
had turned them to stone.

559
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:22,533
How many centuries has it been
since dragons roamed the skies?

560
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:25,535
But I dreamt that
if I carried those eggs

561
00:33:25,569 --> 00:33:28,038
into a great fire,
they would hatch.

562
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:32,610
When I stepped into the fire,
my own people thought I was mad.

563
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:34,812
But when the fire
burned out,

564
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,048
I was unhurt,

565
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:39,918
the Mother of Dragons.

566
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:44,756
Do you understand?

567
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:49,895
I'm no ordinary woman.

568
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:52,897
My dreams come true.

569
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,937
I admire your passion.

570
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,842
But in business, I trust
in logic, not passion.

571
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,543
I'm sorry, little princess.

572
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,912
I am not
your little princess.

573
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,982
I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the blood of old Valyria

574
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:14,018
and I will take
what is mine.

575
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,154
With fire and blood,
I will take it.

576
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:20,758
Yes, My Lady,
but not with my ships.

577
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:41,311
Who taught you to read?

578
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,613
My father, My Lord.

579
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,616
Hmm.

580
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,851
I taught my son
Jaime to read.

581
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,856
The Maester came
to me one day,

582
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,058
told me he wasn't learning.

583
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,861
He couldn't make sense
of the letters.

584
00:34:57,896 --> 00:35:00,598
He reversed them
in his head.

585
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:03,468
The Maester said he'd heard
tell of this affliction

586
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:05,537
and that we simply
must accept it.

587
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,639
Ha!

588
00:35:07,674 --> 00:35:11,143
After that,
I sat Jaime down

589
00:35:11,178 --> 00:35:14,347
for four hours every day
until he learned.

590
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:19,586
He hated me for it,
for a time.

591
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:22,256
For a long time,

592
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:24,125
but he learned.

593
00:35:28,897 --> 00:35:31,999
Where is your father?
Is he alive?

594
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:36,503
Who was he?

595
00:35:36,537 --> 00:35:39,139
A stonemason.

596
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:41,473
A stonemason
who could read?

597
00:35:41,508 --> 00:35:43,909
- Hmm.
- He taught himself.

598
00:35:43,943 --> 00:35:46,678
Quite a man.

599
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:50,015
What killed him?

600
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:53,751
Loyalty.

601
00:35:55,288 --> 00:35:57,456
You're a sharp
little thing, aren't you?

602
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:02,127
Did...

603
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:07,266
Forgive me, My Lord.
I shouldn't ask questions.

604
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:10,536
No...

605
00:36:10,571 --> 00:36:13,473
But you've already begun.

606
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:16,943
Did you know
your father, My Lord?

607
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:19,112
I did.

608
00:36:20,548 --> 00:36:22,316
I grew up with him.

609
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:27,188
I watched him
grow old.

610
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,461
<i>He loved us.</i>

611
00:36:32,495 --> 00:36:35,297
He was a good man,

612
00:36:35,332 --> 00:36:38,033
but a weak man,

613
00:36:38,068 --> 00:36:41,570
a weak man who nearly destroyed
our House and name.

614
00:36:44,141 --> 00:36:45,975
I'm cold.

615
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,711
I'll fetch more wood
for the fire, My Lord.

616
00:36:48,746 --> 00:36:51,114
Mmm.

617
00:36:53,684 --> 00:36:55,951
( Horse whinnies )

618
00:37:14,905 --> 00:37:17,540
( Grunts )

619
00:37:17,575 --> 00:37:19,242
Where are you going, girl?

620
00:37:19,277 --> 00:37:22,212
The armory,
My Lord.

621
00:37:22,247 --> 00:37:23,848
Why?

622
00:37:23,882 --> 00:37:25,716
Lord Tywin sent me.

623
00:37:27,686 --> 00:37:29,954
What might this be?

624
00:37:29,988 --> 00:37:32,890
Lord Tywin gave it to me.

625
00:37:32,924 --> 00:37:34,992
What for?

626
00:37:35,026 --> 00:37:37,861
To take to the armory.

627
00:37:37,896 --> 00:37:40,397
Why would he do that?

628
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:44,001
Let's go and ask him.

629
00:37:46,604 --> 00:37:48,906
Move!

630
00:37:50,408 --> 00:37:52,877
Get out of the way!

631
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:09,328
( Men chatting )

632
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:24,475
Amory Lorch.

633
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:26,510
A girl has named
a second name.

634
00:38:26,545 --> 00:38:28,112
A man will do
what must be done.

635
00:38:28,146 --> 00:38:30,081
Now!

636
00:38:30,115 --> 00:38:33,985
A girl cannot tell a man when
exactly he must do a thing.

637
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,288
A man cannot make a thing
happen before its time.

638
00:38:36,322 --> 00:38:38,257
But he's going to tell Tywin.
He's getting away.

639
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:41,293
- It has to be now.
- ( Sighs )

640
00:38:48,469 --> 00:38:50,569
Guard!

641
00:38:54,774 --> 00:38:57,243
<i>( Horse whinnies )</i>

642
00:38:59,846 --> 00:39:02,180
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

643
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,586
My honor, Your Grace.

644
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:11,055
Your Grace.

645
00:39:16,128 --> 00:39:18,662
- Your Grace.
- Quent.

646
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:41,486
Lady Talisa.

647
00:39:42,488 --> 00:39:44,089
Your Grace.

648
00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:47,660
I'm not sure I'm a lady.

649
00:39:47,694 --> 00:39:49,828
Westerosi customs are still
a bit foreign to me.

650
00:39:49,863 --> 00:39:52,264
It's hard to keep
all the rules straight.

651
00:39:52,298 --> 00:39:55,400
But if I remember
my lessons,

652
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,969
a woman of noble birth
is always called a lady

653
00:39:58,004 --> 00:40:00,504
unless she's a queen
or a princess.

654
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:02,739
I could find
someone who knows.

655
00:40:02,774 --> 00:40:05,342
Why are you so sure
I'm of noble birth?

656
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,410
Because it's obvious.

657
00:40:07,444 --> 00:40:11,080
What if I told you my father
sold lace on the long bridge

658
00:40:11,115 --> 00:40:14,050
and my mother, my brother, and I lived
with him above our shop?

659
00:40:15,552 --> 00:40:16,919
I'd call you a liar.

660
00:40:16,954 --> 00:40:20,356
Not very noble to accuse
a lady of dishonesty.

661
00:40:24,627 --> 00:40:26,495
I always thought
I was a brilliant liar.

662
00:40:27,597 --> 00:40:29,898
Better at amputations,
I'm afraid.

663
00:40:35,003 --> 00:40:36,571
Quite a pretty spot.

664
00:40:36,605 --> 00:40:39,240
Will we be here long?

665
00:40:39,274 --> 00:40:42,009
I couldn't really discuss
troop movements with you.

666
00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:44,478
I'm not a spy.

667
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:47,580
Of course a spy
would deny being a spy.

668
00:40:48,883 --> 00:40:51,418
You're right.
You've found me out.

669
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:53,186
I'm writing a letter
to the Lannisters.

670
00:40:53,221 --> 00:40:55,656
"The Young Wolf
is on the move."

671
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:59,394
Perhaps you'd join me...

672
00:41:00,897 --> 00:41:03,699
If you've got time,
of course, for, well...

673
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:06,035
Robb.

674
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:09,338
Mother.

675
00:41:15,111 --> 00:41:17,980
Mother, this is
Lady Talisa.

676
00:41:18,014 --> 00:41:20,282
She's been helping
with the wounded.

677
00:41:20,316 --> 00:41:23,218
She's been very...
helpful.

678
00:41:23,252 --> 00:41:24,786
Lady Talisa.

679
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,487
Lady Stark.

680
00:41:26,522 --> 00:41:28,355
Lady Talisa...?

681
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:31,959
- Maegyr.
- Maegyr?

682
00:41:31,994 --> 00:41:34,929
Forgive me,
I do not know this name.

683
00:41:34,964 --> 00:41:38,033
An uncommon name here.
An old name in Volantis.

684
00:41:39,102 --> 00:41:42,238
Excuse me, My Lady.
Your Grace.

685
00:41:50,815 --> 00:41:52,483
I've missed you.

686
00:41:52,517 --> 00:41:55,920
Yes, you look
positively forlorn.

687
00:41:55,954 --> 00:41:58,789
You surprised me,
that's all.

688
00:41:58,824 --> 00:42:01,993
I didn't think
I'd see you today.

689
00:42:02,027 --> 00:42:04,395
I wish that you were free
to follow your heart.

690
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,863
I know.

691
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,566
You have inherited your
father's responsibilities.

692
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,402
I'm afraid they come
at a cost.

693
00:42:11,436 --> 00:42:14,839
- I know.
- You are promised to another--

694
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:19,343
a debt that must be paid.

695
00:42:19,378 --> 00:42:21,746
- I haven't forgotten.
- Your Grace.

696
00:42:21,781 --> 00:42:25,517
My Lady.
News from Winterfell.

697
00:42:25,551 --> 00:42:27,485
( Wind howling )

698
00:42:37,897 --> 00:42:40,699
Your brothers desert you?

699
00:42:40,733 --> 00:42:42,967
I can tell you
which way to go.

700
00:42:43,002 --> 00:42:45,637
We'll stop here.

701
00:42:45,671 --> 00:42:47,639
Too dark to go
any farther today.

702
00:42:47,673 --> 00:42:50,575
Here? There's no
shelter here.

703
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,010
There's no shelter
anywhere.

704
00:42:52,044 --> 00:42:54,780
There is if you know
where to look.

705
00:42:58,217 --> 00:43:00,185
The cold
could kill us both.

706
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:02,220
- If you light a fire--
- No fire.

707
00:43:02,254 --> 00:43:05,056
- But a fire is--
- No fire.

708
00:43:07,693 --> 00:43:09,861
Have it your way.

709
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:19,371
We'll stay warmer
if we stay close.

710
00:43:21,341 --> 00:43:23,909
Bet you freeze to death
before I do.

711
00:43:25,746 --> 00:43:28,181
Bet your life.

712
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,775
Think they're out
looking for you?

713
00:43:56,177 --> 00:43:58,946
- Yes.
- Think they'll find you?

714
00:43:58,981 --> 00:44:01,182
Yes.

715
00:44:03,886 --> 00:44:05,920
You're brave.

716
00:44:06,956 --> 00:44:08,789
Stupid,

717
00:44:08,824 --> 00:44:10,725
but brave.

718
00:44:13,362 --> 00:44:16,631
We start again at first light.
Get some sleep.

719
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:34,448
Stop moving.

720
00:44:34,483 --> 00:44:38,153
I'm just trying
to get comfortable.

721
00:44:38,187 --> 00:44:40,055
Stop it!

722
00:44:52,435 --> 00:44:54,970
- <i>You're still moving.</i>
- Was I?

723
00:44:55,004 --> 00:44:57,606
I didn't notice
that time.

724
00:45:08,633 --> 00:45:10,368
This cannot be true.

725
00:45:10,402 --> 00:45:12,103
Bolton: <i>We've had ravens</i>
<i>from White Harbor,</i>

726
00:45:12,137 --> 00:45:14,339
Barrowton
and the Dreadfort.

727
00:45:14,373 --> 00:45:16,374
I'm afraid it is true.

728
00:45:17,276 --> 00:45:19,177
Why?
Why would Theon--

729
00:45:19,212 --> 00:45:21,447
Because the Greyjoys
are treasonous whores.

730
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:24,150
- <i>My brothers?</i>
- We've heard nothing of them.

731
00:45:24,184 --> 00:45:26,085
( Sighs )

732
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,422
But Rodrik Cassel is dead.

733
00:45:30,825 --> 00:45:33,126
I told you,
never trust a Greyjoy!

734
00:45:36,131 --> 00:45:38,265
I must go North at once.

735
00:45:38,299 --> 00:45:40,434
There's still a war
to win, Your Grace.

736
00:45:40,468 --> 00:45:42,936
How can I call myself king
if I can't hold my own castle?

737
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,472
How can I ask men
to follow me if I can't--

738
00:45:44,497 --> 00:45:46,206
You are a king.

739
00:45:46,207 --> 00:45:49,042
And that means you don't have
to do everything yourself.

740
00:45:49,077 --> 00:45:50,878
Let me go
and talk to Theon.

741
00:45:50,912 --> 00:45:53,815
There will be no talk.
He will die for this.

742
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:57,118
Theon holds the castle
with a skeleton crew.

743
00:45:57,152 --> 00:45:59,487
Let me send word to
my bastard at the Dreadfort.

744
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:03,725
He can raise a few hundred men and
retake Winterfell before the new moon.

745
00:46:03,759 --> 00:46:06,861
We have the Lannisters
on the run.

746
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:11,533
If you march all the way back north
now, you'll lose what you gained.

747
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:15,204
My boy would be honored to
bring you Prince Theon's head.

748
00:46:15,238 --> 00:46:19,842
Tell your son Bran and Rickon's
safety is paramount.

749
00:46:19,876 --> 00:46:22,878
And Theon-- I want him
brought to me alive.

750
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,882
I want to look him
in the eye and ask him why.

751
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:29,518
And then I'll take
his head myself.

752
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:33,422
Why on earth would I trust the word
of a lying little savage like you?

753
00:46:33,456 --> 00:46:35,357
I'm no liar.

754
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,427
All wildlings
are liars and savages

755
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:40,296
with no loyalty
to anything or anyone.

756
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,665
I done what I had
to do to stay alive.

757
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,568
I hate the Starks
as well as you do.

758
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:48,905
Let me serve you,
My Lord.

759
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,742
How? And don't tell me
to put a spear in your hand.

760
00:46:51,776 --> 00:46:54,244
There are other ways
to serve, My Lord.

761
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,813
I'm a prince now,
and you'd do well--

762
00:46:56,848 --> 00:46:59,750
There are other ways
to serve, my prince.

763
00:46:59,785 --> 00:47:02,286
( Chuckles )

764
00:47:04,223 --> 00:47:05,858
Like what?

765
00:47:08,394 --> 00:47:11,197
We know things,
the free people.

766
00:47:11,231 --> 00:47:13,799
You know things?

767
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:15,735
Like what?

768
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:18,037
How to eat dirt?
( Laughs )

769
00:47:18,071 --> 00:47:21,073
( Scoffs )
Other things.

770
00:47:22,242 --> 00:47:24,843
Savage things.

771
00:47:26,846 --> 00:47:28,680
Wait outside.

772
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,798
I always wondered
what you had under there.

773
00:47:47,832 --> 00:47:50,834
It comes at a price.

774
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,136
I'm not killing you.
That's your price.

775
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:54,738
I already had that.

776
00:47:56,274 --> 00:47:57,741
What do you want, then,

777
00:47:57,775 --> 00:48:00,377
other than
your miserable life?

778
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:02,513
What all free people want--

779
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,682
my freedom.

780
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:11,423
Well, you shall
have it, then.

781
00:48:13,692 --> 00:48:16,294
But only if you
serve me well.

782
00:48:22,234 --> 00:48:24,102
- Ow.
- Shh.

783
00:48:24,136 --> 00:48:27,205
- It's not deep.
- I thought they were going to kill me.

784
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:28,773
They thought so, too.

785
00:48:28,807 --> 00:48:31,443
He hated me,
the man who hit me.

786
00:48:31,477 --> 00:48:34,045
I saw it in his eyes.
Hated me.

787
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,880
He never met me before,

788
00:48:35,915 --> 00:48:38,883
but he wanted
to hurt me.

789
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:41,953
- Of course he did.
- Why? Why would a stranger--

790
00:48:41,987 --> 00:48:44,255
You are everything
he will never have.

791
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:46,424
Your horse eats better
than his children.

792
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:49,794
It doesn't matter now.
He's dead.

793
00:48:49,828 --> 00:48:52,697
I would have given them
bread if I had it.

794
00:48:52,732 --> 00:48:55,333
I hate the King
more than any of them.

795
00:48:55,368 --> 00:48:57,202
Don't say these things.

796
00:48:57,236 --> 00:48:58,503
If the wrong
people hear you--

797
00:48:58,537 --> 00:49:00,839
But you're not
the wrong people.

798
00:49:06,245 --> 00:49:08,413
Don't trust anybody.

799
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:11,015
Life is safer
that way.

800
00:49:39,413 --> 00:49:42,582
( Murmurs )

801
00:49:51,859 --> 00:49:54,694
And where
are you going?

802
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:58,498
I have something for you
from Prince Theon.

803
00:49:58,532 --> 00:50:01,367
- What?
- Me.

804
00:50:03,771 --> 00:50:06,573
He says I'm to make
the rounds.

805
00:50:12,714 --> 00:50:15,215
And keep you warm.

806
00:50:20,154 --> 00:50:22,756
( Groans )

807
00:50:25,626 --> 00:50:28,294
( Whistles )

808
00:50:37,405 --> 00:50:39,873
( Panting )

809
00:50:42,243 --> 00:50:45,579
The Spice King refuses me
because I'm a bad investment.

810
00:50:45,613 --> 00:50:47,255
The Silk King won't support me

811
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,280
because of his business with
the Lannisters.

812
00:50:49,283 --> 00:50:51,251
Why offend
his best customer?

813
00:50:51,285 --> 00:50:54,654
And the Copper King
offers me a single ship

814
00:50:54,688 --> 00:50:58,057
on the condition that I lie
with him for a night.

815
00:50:58,091 --> 00:51:01,059
Does he think I will
whore myself for a boat?

816
00:51:01,094 --> 00:51:04,595
When I came to this city,
I had nothing.

817
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:07,131
Truly nothing.

818
00:51:07,165 --> 00:51:09,233
I slept by the docks.

819
00:51:09,267 --> 00:51:12,002
And when I could find work
loading the ships, I would eat.

820
00:51:12,037 --> 00:51:15,072
If not,
I dreamed of food.

821
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:18,108
Today I am the richest
man in Qarth.

822
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,577
Do you think the path
from poverty to wealth

823
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:22,979
is always pure
and honorable?

824
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:26,649
I have done
many things, Khaleesi,

825
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:29,185
that a righteous man
would condemn.

826
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:32,789
And here I am,
with no regrets.

827
00:51:45,638 --> 00:51:49,274
Bar the gates.
Ring the bells.

828
00:51:49,308 --> 00:51:51,976
Slowly, Khaleesi.

829
00:51:52,011 --> 00:51:54,145
- <i>( Bells tolling )</i>
- <i>( People shouting )</i>

830
00:52:01,419 --> 00:52:03,686
<i>Where are they?</i>

831
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:12,796
Where are my dragons?!

832
00:52:18,437 --> 00:52:21,172
<i>( Dragons screeching )</i>

833
00:52:40,793 --> 00:52:43,562
<i>( Theme music playing )</i>

834
00:52:43,587 --> 00:52:47,587
