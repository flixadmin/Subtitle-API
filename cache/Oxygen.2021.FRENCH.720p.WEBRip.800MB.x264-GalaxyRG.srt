Cryogenics units are medical labs.

167

MILO, can you do
a DNA search for Omicron 267?

<i>I'll stay with you. Promise.
How's your oxygen?</i>

193
00:20:21,442 --> 00:20:23,025
What's going on?
Have you found me?

194
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:27,109
<i>Liz? No, Liz, focus.
It's important. What's your oxygen level?</i>

195
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:30,692
I'm at 31%.

196
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:34,234
- <i>So, how long do we have?</i>
- How long to do what?

197
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:37,775
<i>Yes, Liz, listen to me.
I need to know how much time we have.</i>

198

<i>Elizabeth? Liz?
Are you there?</i>

199
00:20:45,275 --> 00:20:48,484
MILO.
How long before the oxygen runs out?

200

203
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:01,400
<i>I need you to tell me

204

<i>Anything at all. Suspect behavior,
someone who might want to hurt you.</i>

205
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,400
Hurt me?
I don't think so. I don't.

206
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:11,567
- Or maybe, I suppose, but I don't know.
- <i>I need you to think.</i>

207
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,900
What are you hiding from me?
What's going on?

208
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:16,525
<i>Try to focus, please.</i>

209
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,275
You're not telling me the truth.

210
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:20,192
Tell me.

211
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:24,275
You know where I am

<i>No, we haven't
managed to locate you.</i>

232
00:22:30,442 --> 00:22:32,317
<i>There, that's it. Calm down.</i>

MILO, call back.

313
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,192
Call back.

314
00:32:17,775 --> 00:32:19,984
- <i>Who are you?</i>
- Excuse me.

315
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:22,775
You have to put Léo on,
please, it's urgent.

316
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:26,567
- Please, trust me, I have to speak to him.
- <i>Never call this number again.</i>

317
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,859
<i>Call interrupted at source.</i>

Call back.

319
00:32:40,734 --> 00:32:44,234
Call back.

320
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,900
Shit!

321
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,484
Shit.

322
00:32:58,525 --> 00:32:59,817
Shit.

<i>Oxygen level, 21%.</i>

Yes.

325
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:09,567
Okay, how does it open?

326
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:55,359
No, it's not real.

327
00:34:57,734 --> 00:34:58,859
There's no rat.

328
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:47,442
<i>Your pulse is high.</i>

329
00:35:47,525 --> 00:35:49,442
<i>A sedative is recommended.</i>

330
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:52,359
- <i>Would you like a sedative?</i>
- No.

331
00:35:57,234 --> 00:35:59,525
Yes.

332
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,442
<i>Alert, damage detected.</i>

333
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:56,650
<i>Warning.</i>

00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:33,317
I'm gonna die.

341
00:37:37,567 --> 00:37:39,609
I'm gonna die.

342
00:37:46,984 --> 00:37:48,442
I'm gonna die.

<i>Incoming call.</i>

- <i>Elizabeth, are you there?</i>
- Yes, hello. Yes.

346
00:38:33,775 --> 00:38:35,609
MILO, boost the network.

347

- <i>Network amplification underway.</i>
- Can you hear me?

348
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:42,609
<i>Got her. Liz, listen. We've the subpoena.
My men are at Cryosalide.</i>

349
00:38:42,692 --> 00:38:43,900
You have the codes?

350
00:38:43,984 --> 00:38:45,984
<i>Yes, we'll get them shortly.</i>

351
00:38:46,067 --> 00:38:47,317
<i>It's nearly over, Liz.</i>

352
00:38:48,275 --> 00:38:49,984
- You've got me?
- <i>We've got you.</i>

353
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:54,734
Captain Moreau?

354
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,859
- Moreau?
- <i>It's going to be okay.</i>

355
00:38:58,942 --> 00:39:00,442
There's a problem, right?

356
00:39:00,525 --> 00:39:02,692
Tell me what's going on.

357
00:39:02,775 --> 00:39:05,734
- <i>Oxygen level, 17%.
- What? 17%?</i>

358
00:39:05,817 --> 00:39:08,984
17%?
But I was at 20%.

359
00:39:09,067 --> 00:39:10,984
<i>What's happening?
Talk to me.</i>

360
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:13,692
I don't know.
I'm losing track of time.

361
00:39:13,775 --> 00:39:15,525
I see images.
I see things.

362
00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:17,984
<i>No, Liz. Listen to me carefully.</i>

363
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:21,734
<i>You're experiencing a psychotic episode

- But...
- <i>Prisoners of war go through it.</i>

365
00:39:25,234 --> 00:39:29,650
Your number that wasn't assigned,
was that real or not?

366
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,567
<i>What? No, we were cut off.
I didn't move.</i>

367
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,525
<i>I kept trying to reach you.</i>

368
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:36,400
<i>Liz, pull yourself together.</i>

369
00:39:36,484 --> 00:39:39,234
<i>Focus on what you know is real.</i>

370
00:39:39,317 --> 00:39:42,817
<i>Focus on your body,
on what you know is real.</i>

371
00:39:46,025 --> 00:39:48,067
<i>Find a way to focus on your body.</i>

372
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,067
Okay, okay, okay.

373
00:39:51,275 --> 00:39:52,984
<i>Elizabeth, are you there?</i>

374
00:39:56,275 --> 00:39:57,942
<i>Liz?</i>

- <i>Are you still there?
- Injury detected on bioform.</i>

376
00:40:13,525 --> 00:40:15,817
- <i>Hello? Liz!
- Status, no threat to life.</i>

377
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:28,525
<i>Liz?</i>

378
00:40:29,234 --> 00:40:30,234
<i>Liz, talk to me.</i>

379
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:34,150
Are you sure you want to do it?

380
00:40:35,775 --> 00:40:36,775
Yeah.

381
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:41,025
<i>Hello, Liz?</i>

382
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,817
<i>Liz, please...</i>

383
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,400
<i>Intravenous antibiotic administered
to prevent infection.</i>

384
00:40:57,484 --> 00:40:59,859
<i>Antibiotics? Why, Liz?
What did you do?</i>

385
00:40:59,942 --> 00:41:01,484
I focused on what's real.

386
00:41:04,317 --> 00:41:06,109
How long have I been missing?

387
00:41:06,984 --> 00:41:09,734
<i>You were active on social media
a few days ago.</i>

388
00:41:09,817 --> 00:41:11,734
<i>And no one has reported you missing.</i>

389
00:41:11,817 --> 00:41:14,234
I have a husband. Léo.

390
00:41:15,775 --> 00:41:17,775
And I think we were trying to have kids.

391
00:41:18,817 --> 00:41:21,025
- <i>Léo?</i>
- Yes.

392
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:26,234
What?
Who are you talking to?

393
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,359
- <i>No one.</i>
- Is it about Léo?

394
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:29,442
- <i>No.</i>
- Huh?

395
00:41:30,817 --> 00:41:31,942
Is he well?

396
00:41:32,025 --> 00:41:35,275
Find Léo.
He'll know what happened.

397
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,275
<i>Listen. According to
our information, you were never married.</i>

398
00:41:39,817 --> 00:41:40,817
What?

399
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,150
No, no, no.

400
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:46,817
We were trying to have kids.

401
00:41:47,817 --> 00:41:51,192
MILO, search for Dr. Léo Ferguson.

402
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:52,359
<i>No result.</i>

403
00:41:52,442 --> 00:41:53,859
What?

404
00:41:53,942 --> 00:41:55,692
That's not possible.
It's not.

405
00:41:55,775 --> 00:41:57,942
He was there.
No, that's not possible.

406
00:41:58,025 --> 00:41:59,484
RESULTS FOR "FERGUSON"

407
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:00,692
That's not possible.

408
00:42:00,775 --> 00:42:05,484
MILO, search for Dr. Elizabeth Hansen
at the Science and Technology Awards.

409
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:07,317
No.

410
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:09,734
No...

411
00:42:11,192 --> 00:42:12,317
- <i>Elizabeth.</i>
- No.

412
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,609
That's impossible.
We were both in the photo.

413
00:42:14,692 --> 00:42:17,109
We were together.
He was there.

414
00:42:17,192 --> 00:42:20,234
I called him.
Someone answered.

415
00:42:20,984 --> 00:42:22,275
A woman.
She knew him.

416
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:23,942
- <i>What woman?</i>
- A woman...

417
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:25,400
<i>What did you say to her?</i>

418
00:42:25,484 --> 00:42:26,692
Nothing.
She hung up.

419
00:42:26,775 --> 00:42:27,942
She knew him.

420
00:42:28,025 --> 00:42:30,234
She knew him.
She knew Léo.

421
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,692
<i>No, she wasn't real.</i>

422
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:34,984
What's going on?

423
00:42:35,067 --> 00:42:38,817
<i>Liz, listen to me.
Léo isn't real either.</i>

424
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,567
- He was real.
- <i>Yes, I know.</i>

425
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,400
<i>I know you're convinced of it.</i>

426
00:42:44,484 --> 00:42:46,942
<i>Your mind's playing tricks on you,
that's all.</i>

427
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:50,067
<i>To help you to keep going.
You have to trust me, I'll get you out.</i>

428
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,317
You're lying to me.

429
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,984
<i>You played basketball.</i>

430
00:42:53,484 --> 00:42:54,484
What?

431
00:42:55,192 --> 00:42:57,317
<i>At college.
You were gifted.</i>

432
00:42:58,775 --> 00:43:02,067
<i>I thought you'd like
to hear something about yourself</i>

433
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,359
<i>and during my search, that struck me.</i>

434
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,692
Basketball?

435
00:43:08,775 --> 00:43:09,775
<i>Yes.</i>

436
00:43:10,275 --> 00:43:11,942
<i>It stood out from the rest.</i>

437
00:43:12,025 --> 00:43:15,150
<i>Doctorate in bio-engineering,
grants, awards.</i>

438
00:43:16,234 --> 00:43:17,567
<i>You are impressive.</i>

439
00:43:19,692 --> 00:43:21,275
<i>Does it ring a bell?</i>

440
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,484
No.

441
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,400
<i>You were born in Stockholm.</i>

442
00:43:27,275 --> 00:43:29,525
<i>Your mother was single
and raised you alone.</i>

443
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:32,150
<i>She brought you here
when you were six years old.</i>

444
00:43:32,734 --> 00:43:35,359
Alice.
Her name's Alice.

445
00:43:35,442 --> 00:43:36,442
<i>No.</i>

446
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:38,984
- Her name isn't Alice?
- <i>Isabelle.</i>

447
00:43:39,067 --> 00:43:40,900
No, no, no.
I can see her.

448
00:43:40,984 --> 00:43:42,900
- <i>No, Liz...</i>
- I can see her.

449
00:43:42,984 --> 00:43:45,025
<i>Liz, never mind.
Stay with me.</i>

450
00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:47,525
<i>You went to Oxford
after medical school in Paris.</i>

451
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,900
Oxford.
Oxford.

452
00:43:49,984 --> 00:43:52,775
I remember Oxford.
That's where I met Léo.

453
00:43:55,275 --> 00:43:57,650
That's where I met him.
He's real, I know he is.

454
00:43:57,734 --> 00:43:58,609
<i>Elizabeth?</i>

455
00:43:58,692 --> 00:44:01,692
Look for Léo.
I swear he exists.

456
00:44:01,775 --> 00:44:03,775
<i>Oxygen level, 15%.</i>

457
00:44:03,859 --> 00:44:07,359
- <i>Alert, blood pressure at 210/130.</i>
- Where are you? You should have found me.

458
00:44:07,442 --> 00:44:09,275
<i>Stay strong.
Just a few more minutes.</i>

459
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,984
I need the codes! I need the codes!

460
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:14,859
<i>I have men at Cryosalide
getting the codes.</i>

461
00:44:14,942 --> 00:44:17,650
But why are they...
It's too long.

462
00:44:19,317 --> 00:44:20,859
Who are you talking to?

463
00:44:20,942 --> 00:44:23,609
What? Hello?

464
00:44:23,692 --> 00:44:26,400
Who are you talking to?
I hear you talking to someone.

465
00:44:26,484 --> 00:44:29,067
- <i>You're hearing things.</i>
- You're talking. No, no.

466
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,109
<i>Liz. We're on it.
We're close. We're really close.</i>

467
00:44:32,192 --> 00:44:33,752
- You're lying.
- <i>We're 20 minutes away.</i>

468
00:44:33,817 --> 00:44:35,737
- Are you doing this to me?
- <i>We're nearly there.</i>

469
00:44:35,817 --> 00:44:38,275
<i>I was in the army.</i>

470
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:41,001
- <i>I spent months in a hole underground...</i>
- You're doing this to me.

471
00:44:41,025 --> 00:44:44,109
<i>I've been in that situation.
I know what you're going through.</i>

472
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:46,789
- <i>I'm with you...</i>
- MILO, hang up.

473
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,400
- <i>No, Liz...</i>
- MILO, hang up.

474
00:44:48,484 --> 00:44:50,317
- <i>Wait...
- Disconnected.</i>

475
00:46:31,192 --> 00:46:32,400
<i>Incoming call.</i>

476
00:46:36,817 --> 00:46:37,900
<i>Incoming call.</i>

477
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,900
Reject call.

478
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:41,817
<i>Call rejected.</i>

479
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:47,525
MILO, play the last 30 seconds
of the last transmission again.

480
00:46:49,525 --> 00:46:51,692
<i>I need the codes!
I need the codes!</i>

481
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:54,400
<i>I have guys at Cryosalide
getting the codes.</i>

482
00:46:54,484 --> 00:46:55,734
<i>But why?</i>

483
00:46:58,609 --> 00:46:59,984
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

484
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,067
Pause.

485
00:47:02,525 --> 00:47:04,484
Play the last five seconds again.

486
00:47:11,859 --> 00:47:12,859
Pause.

487
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:18,484
Turn up the volume and play it back.

488
00:47:18,567 --> 00:47:21,817
<i>Tell her she's hearing things.
That it's the stress.</i>

489
00:47:24,234 --> 00:47:25,234
Again.

490
00:47:27,025 --> 00:47:29,942
<i>Tell her she's hearing things.
That it's the stress.</i>

491
00:47:31,275 --> 00:47:32,442
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

492
00:47:33,067 --> 00:47:34,067
Pause.

493
00:47:35,067 --> 00:47:36,234
<i>Incoming call.</i>

<i>Call rejected.</i>

496
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,567
Can you see me?
Can you hear me?

497
00:47:45,817 --> 00:47:47,359
What do you want from me?

498
00:47:47,442 --> 00:47:48,525
<i>Incoming call.</i>

499
00:47:50,817 --> 00:47:52,650
Are you assholes messing with me?

500
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,442
MILO, accept the call.

501
00:47:55,525 --> 00:47:56,525
Who are you?

502
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:59,984
Why are you doing this to me?

503
00:48:00,067 --> 00:48:01,067
<i>Hello?</i>

504
00:48:02,234 --> 00:48:03,359
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

505
00:48:04,067 --> 00:48:05,484
<i>Answer me, please.</i>

506
00:48:06,692 --> 00:48:09,109
<i>You're in a cryogenic unit, is that right?</i>

507
00:48:09,192 --> 00:48:11,359
<i>You called me,
but you were looking for Léo.</i>

508
00:48:11,442 --> 00:48:13,067
<i>Listen, we don't have much time.</i>

509
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,942
<i>It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Something must have gone wrong.</i>

510
00:48:17,025 --> 00:48:19,025
- I want to talk to Léo.
- <i>Impossible.</i>

511
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:21,025
<i>You must listen to me.
I can help you.</i>

512
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:23,567
I won't listen until I speak to Léo.

513
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,359
- <i>That's impossible.</i>
- I want to talk to him now.

514
00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:29,567
I want to talk to him now!
Put him on now!

515
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,067
<i>Léo is dead.</i>

516
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,234
What?

517
00:48:34,317 --> 00:48:35,692
I don't believe you.

518
00:48:35,775 --> 00:48:38,025
<i>You really need to listen to me.</i>

519
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:39,109
- <i>Liz...</i>
- Go to hell.

520
00:48:39,192 --> 00:48:41,400
- <i>No, listen to me...</i>
- MILO, end the call.

521
00:48:41,484 --> 00:48:45,817
- <i>No, wait...
- Call ended. Oxygen level, 14%.</i>

522
00:48:47,234 --> 00:48:48,234
<i>Incoming call.</i>

<i>Incoming call.</i>

524
00:48:55,109 --> 00:48:57,442
MILO, accept call.

525
00:48:57,525 --> 00:49:00,484
<i>Listen to me.
I can help you.</i>

526
00:49:00,567 --> 00:49:03,692
<i>No one else can help you
at this point, Liz.</i>

527
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:06,400
How do you know my name?
I never told you.

528
00:49:06,484 --> 00:49:09,817
<i>No need. I knew who you were
the moment I heard your voice,</i>

529
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,442
<i>even though I couldn't believe it.</i>

530
00:49:11,525 --> 00:49:13,317
Tell me who you are, you and the others.

531
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,234
<i>I don't know who you spoke to,
but I know what's going on.</i>

532
00:49:16,317 --> 00:49:18,650
- MILO, end...
- <i>I know the codes!</i>

533
00:49:18,734 --> 00:49:19,567
Give them to me.

534
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,567
- <i>I will, but you have to listen...</i>
- Give them to me.

535
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:25,650
<i>You can't use them
to open the unit!</i>

536
00:49:27,025 --> 00:49:28,859
- MILO, end the...
- <i>Okay, okay.</i>

537
00:49:30,775 --> 00:49:34,817
<i>Uppercase, N-M-347.</i>

538
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:38,484
<i>Lowercase, C-D-A.</i>

539
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,692
Transfer of administrator control.

540
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:48,734
<i>Administrator control transfer launched.
Enter the password.</i>

541
00:49:49,317 --> 00:49:54,734
Uppercase, N-M-347.
Lowercase, C-D-A.

542
00:49:54,817 --> 00:49:57,275
<i>Liz, don't open it! Please!</i>

543
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,650
<i>Administrator control transfer complete.</i>

544
00:50:00,734 --> 00:50:02,900
<i>Administrator privileges granted.</i>

545
00:50:07,275 --> 00:50:10,275
MILO, unlock.

546
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,567
<i>Unlocking activated.</i>

547
00:50:14,109 --> 00:50:16,442
<i>Please, no. You'll die.</i>

548
00:50:16,525 --> 00:50:19,525
<i>I can prove it.
If you open the unit, you'll die.</i>

549
00:50:19,609 --> 00:50:22,067
MILO, pause unlocking.
You have ten seconds.

550
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,110
<i>Thank you, thank you.
Just let me explain.</i>

551
00:50:24,192 --> 00:50:25,734
- Eight seconds.
- <i>Okay, okay!</i>

552
00:50:25,817 --> 00:50:27,859
<i>Go to "system preferences."</i>

553
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,234
<i>Find the centrifuge controls.</i>

554
00:50:30,317 --> 00:50:32,692
- System preferences.
- <i>Please. Just let me explain.</i>

555
00:50:32,775 --> 00:50:34,150
Centrifuge controls.

556
00:50:35,525 --> 00:50:36,525
Got them.

557
00:50:37,317 --> 00:50:39,484
<i>It's set at one.
Switch to...</i>

558
00:50:39,567 --> 00:50:41,359
Switch to what?

559
00:50:41,442 --> 00:50:43,192
<i>This isn't how you should find out.</i>

560
00:50:43,275 --> 00:50:44,525
Switch to what?

561
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:45,525
MILO...

562
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:48,109
<i>Zero. Switch to zero.</i>

563
00:50:48,192 --> 00:50:50,900
Switch to zero.

564
00:50:50,984 --> 00:50:53,192
<i>Please, Liz.
Don't do it.</i>

565
00:50:53,275 --> 00:50:55,525
<i>Turning off microthrusters.</i>

566
00:50:55,609 --> 00:50:58,900
<i>I'm sorry, Liz. I really am.</i>

567
00:51:06,275 --> 00:51:09,317
<i>Alert, lengthy exposure to weightlessness</i>

568
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,650
<i>can be harmful to the bioform.</i>

569
00:51:13,317 --> 00:51:14,317
<i>Liz.</i>

570
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:26,900
<i>Liz!</i>

571
00:51:27,525 --> 00:51:28,775
Where am I?

572
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:32,567
<i>Around 40,389 miles from Earth.</i>

573
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:34,234
No, no, no.

574
00:51:35,067 --> 00:51:36,067
No.

575
00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:41,859
MILO, distance from Earth?

576
00:51:41,942 --> 00:51:44,859
<i>42,735 miles.</i>

577
00:51:47,275 --> 00:51:48,900
That's not possible.

578
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,317
<i>Sorry, Liz.
But time is limited.</i>

579
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,734
<i>You'll soon be beyond the range
of our communication satellites.</i>

580
00:52:02,484 --> 00:52:04,900
<i>Centrifuge rotation launched.</i>

581
00:52:04,984 --> 00:52:08,067
<i>G-1 launched.
Oxygen level, 13%.</i>

582
00:52:08,734 --> 00:52:10,234
<i>Liz, please.</i>

583
00:52:10,317 --> 00:52:13,734
<i>You were placed in hypersleep
to allow you to carry out your mission.</i>

584
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,359
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

585
00:52:17,025 --> 00:52:18,442
<i>I can't bring you home.</i>

586
00:52:20,067 --> 00:52:21,609
<i>But I designed the system,</i>

587
00:52:21,692 --> 00:52:24,442
<i>and maybe we could
put you back into hypersleep.</i>

588
00:52:24,525 --> 00:52:27,317
<i>It would give you a chance.
Please.</i>

589
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:28,900
What mission?

590
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:34,650
<i>If we can locate the damage,
divert the affected systems...</i>

591
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:35,817
What mission?

592
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,692
<i>Colonizing a planet
orbiting around Wolf 10-61,</i>

593
00:52:41,775 --> 00:52:43,859
<i>fourteen light-years from Earth.</i>

594
00:52:43,942 --> 00:52:45,484
<i>But you only just left.</i>

595
00:52:46,067 --> 00:52:50,317
<i>Your HIVE transporter hasn't yet engaged
its nuclear-powered thrust.</i>

596
00:52:50,942 --> 00:52:53,900
No, no, no, no, no...

597
00:52:53,984 --> 00:52:55,817
<i>Liz, we have to act fast.</i>

598
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,484
This isn't real.

599
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:14,775
Was it a military operation?
Do I work for the Ministry of Defense?

600
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:16,525
<i>Yes. Do you remember?</i>

601
00:53:16,609 --> 00:53:17,734
Why the army?

602
00:53:18,567 --> 00:53:21,692
<i>The human race
will die out in two generations.</i>

603
00:53:21,775 --> 00:53:23,692
<i>That can't be made public.</i>

604
00:53:26,109 --> 00:53:27,317
Did he know?

605
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,400
<i>Who?</i>

606
00:53:29,567 --> 00:53:31,025
That guy.
Moreau.

607
00:53:32,025 --> 00:53:34,734
When I asked for help, he was kind,

608
00:53:35,525 --> 00:53:39,109
- but he was lying to me, right?
- <i>Liz. He had no choice.</i>

609
00:53:39,192 --> 00:53:42,067
<i>As soon as the police
looked for information about you,</i>

610
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,484
<i>the Ministry got involved.</i>

611
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:47,984
<i>Everything said after that
was only what they wanted you to hear.</i>

612
00:53:48,067 --> 00:53:49,067
But why?

613
00:53:49,484 --> 00:53:53,942
If I was a key part of the project,
why not just tell me the truth?

614
00:53:54,609 --> 00:53:56,109
<i>The fog of memory.</i>

615
00:53:56,192 --> 00:54:00,859
<i>It was impossible to foresee your reaction
or the memories that would return first.</i>

616
00:54:01,525 --> 00:54:02,650
<i>You're a threat.</i>

617
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,984
<i>Speak to the wrong person,
and it all goes public.</i>

618
00:54:06,567 --> 00:54:11,150
<i>General panic, chaos.
They couldn't take that risk.</i>

619
00:54:11,234 --> 00:54:15,275
I thought he was doing this to me,
that he was holding me.

620
00:54:17,234 --> 00:54:19,692
He didn't tell me Léo was dead,
he said he wasn't real.

621
00:54:19,775 --> 00:54:23,567
<i>Liz, everything, I mean everything,
everything was done</i>

622
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:27,400
<i>from the moment they realized
you'd regained consciousness</i>

623
00:54:27,484 --> 00:54:31,234
<i>to prevent you
from recovering your memory.</i>

624
00:54:33,484 --> 00:54:35,234
So he was playing for time.

625
00:54:37,192 --> 00:54:38,484
He was waiting...

626
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:41,442
He was waiting
for me to run out of oxygen.

627
00:54:57,442 --> 00:54:58,859
Léo was real...

628
00:55:00,984 --> 00:55:02,275
and he's dead.

629
00:55:02,859 --> 00:55:03,859
<i>Yes.</i>

630
00:55:14,067 --> 00:55:15,942
12%.
12%.

631
00:55:16,025 --> 00:55:17,734
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

632
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,317
What happened to him?

633
00:55:23,192 --> 00:55:24,192
<i>He was sick.</i>

634
00:55:25,775 --> 00:55:29,734
<i>Léo got sick, like millions of others
who were killed by the virus.</i>

635
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,400
<i>Liz?</i>

636
00:55:41,817 --> 00:55:46,317
No, no, no. That doesn't add up.
They said I went missing three days ago.

637
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:50,025
<i>You've been in hypersleep
much longer than that.</i>

638
00:55:53,275 --> 00:55:54,359
How long?

639
00:55:57,067 --> 00:55:58,067
How long?

640
00:55:59,442 --> 00:56:00,525
<i>Twelve years.</i>

641
00:56:05,484 --> 00:56:07,275
<i>I'm really sorry, Liz.</i>

642
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:10,984
<i>You're wasting your time and your oxygen.</i>

643
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:14,859
<i>In ten minutes, you'll be out of range,
and we won't be able to communicate.</i>

644
00:56:14,942 --> 00:56:18,067
<i>Either you die alone,
or you help me to solve the problem</i>

645
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:19,859
- <i>and give yourself a chance.</i>
- No.

646
00:56:19,942 --> 00:56:22,317
- <i>I know what I'd choose.</i>
- Okay, okay, okay.

647
00:56:25,775 --> 00:56:26,859
Where do we begin?

648
00:56:28,525 --> 00:56:31,650
<i>Okay, first we need
to figure out what woke you up.</i>

649
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,275
MILO, why was the bioform awakened?

650
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:39,525
<i>Processor 3-54 overheating
due to loss of oxygen reserves.</i>

651
00:56:39,609 --> 00:56:41,234
What is processor 3-54 used for?

652
00:56:41,317 --> 00:56:45,442
<i>Processor 3-54 monitors and
stimulates the subject's cerebral activity</i>

653
00:56:45,525 --> 00:56:47,109
<i>to avoid cellular atrophy.</i>

654
00:56:47,192 --> 00:56:50,817
Brain atrophy. You hear that?
I could do without that, personally.

655
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,192
<i>I agree.</i>

656
00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:55,692
<i>We must divert
the cerebral activity monitor</i>

657
00:56:55,775 --> 00:56:59,025
<i>to another processor
assigned to non-essential functions.</i>

658
00:56:59,109 --> 00:57:02,275
MILO, list all the processors
linked to non-essential functions.

659
00:57:03,442 --> 00:57:06,692
<i>All functions assigned
to processor 694.</i>

660
00:57:07,692 --> 00:57:09,484
Is there any danger to the bioform

661
00:57:09,567 --> 00:57:12,025
if all functions of processor 694
are deactivated?

662
00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:13,900
<i>Zero danger for the bioform.</i>

663
00:57:13,984 --> 00:57:16,942
So, go on.
Go on, deactivate them.

664
00:57:17,692 --> 00:57:19,317
<i>Deactivation underway.</i>

665
00:57:28,567 --> 00:57:34,984
MILO, transfer all functions
of processor 3-54 to 694.

666
00:57:35,067 --> 00:57:37,692
<i>The data exceeds processor capacity.</i>

667
00:57:38,359 --> 00:57:39,359
Damn.

668
00:57:41,234 --> 00:57:42,400
Shit.

669
00:57:42,484 --> 00:57:44,192
What do we do now?

670
00:57:44,275 --> 00:57:46,567
<i>We have to make
some difficult choices now.</i>

671
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:49,150
<i>Deactivate systems
that don't have priority.</i>

672
00:57:49,234 --> 00:57:51,609
<i>Find... Too late! They're here!</i>

673
00:57:51,692 --> 00:57:54,734
- <i>Find a way to install a shunt...</i>
- What do you mean, "they're here"?

674
00:57:54,817 --> 00:57:58,650
<i>Return to hypersleep.
But do it before the oxygen hits 2%,</i>

675
00:57:58,734 --> 00:58:00,859
<i>or you won't have enough
for resuscitation.</i>

676
00:58:00,942 --> 00:58:02,942
But I won't know how to do it.

677
00:58:03,025 --> 00:58:05,150
<i>You do know.
You have all the answers.</i>

678
00:58:05,234 --> 00:58:09,775
<i>Figure out what triggers your memories,
then you'll find those you need.</i>

679
00:58:09,859 --> 00:58:12,609
You designed it. I won't know how.

680
00:58:12,692 --> 00:58:14,067
<i>On the ground!</i>

681
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:15,859
- Hello?
- <i>Right now!</i>

682
00:58:15,942 --> 00:58:16,775
- <i>No.</i>
- Hello?

683
00:58:16,859 --> 00:58:20,192
- <i>Find what triggers your memories.
- Get on the floor!</i>

684
00:58:20,275 --> 00:58:22,626
- <i>2%! Find Léo!
- On the floor, I said!</i>

685
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:25,775
<i>Find Léo!</i>

686
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:27,025
<i>Connection lost.</i>

687
00:58:30,275 --> 00:58:32,400
Shit, shit, shit.
MILO, reconnect.

688
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:36,900
<i>This number is unassigned.
Please check the number.</i>

689
00:58:36,984 --> 00:58:38,900
Don't leave me alone, please.

690
00:58:51,067 --> 00:58:52,067
Okay.

691
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:54,942
Okay, okay, okay.
I worked on this thing.

692
00:58:55,025 --> 00:58:56,817
I worked on it.

693
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:02,359
MILO, who authorized Omicron 267's
participation in this mission?

694
00:59:02,442 --> 00:59:07,150
<i>Participation of Omicron 267
authorized by Hansen, Elizabeth, doctor.</i>

695
00:59:08,609 --> 00:59:10,275
Yeah, of course.

696
00:59:10,984 --> 00:59:12,734
So that's me.
That's me.

697
00:59:13,275 --> 00:59:14,317
It's me, it's me.

698
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,484
A thing only I know.
Only I know.

699
00:59:16,567 --> 00:59:19,734
"Find Léo, find Léo."
What does "find Léo" mean?

700
00:59:19,817 --> 00:59:21,609
What does it mean?

701
00:59:21,692 --> 00:59:24,150
What does it mean,
damn it, "find Léo?"

702
00:59:25,442 --> 00:59:27,067
What does it mean?

703
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:29,859
How do I do it?
How do I do it?

704
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,369
<i>Oxygen level, 11%.</i>

705
00:59:37,567 --> 00:59:39,817
Okay, okay.
Think.

706
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,275
MILO, show me all low-priority processors.

707
00:59:45,692 --> 00:59:47,317
Okay, okay, okay.

708
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:51,817
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

709
00:59:53,567 --> 00:59:56,775
Too many.
There are too many.

710
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:01,942
Explain kinetic regulation.

711
01:00:02,025 --> 01:00:06,900
<i>Kinetic regulation delivers
weak electric impulses to muscle groups</i>

712
01:00:06,984 --> 01:00:08,609
<i>to prevent atrophy.</i>

713
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:11,067
Okay. And if we deactivate it,
what happens?

714
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,817
<i>Degeneration of muscular tissue.</i>

715
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,109
And that's considered low priority, right?

716
01:00:16,775 --> 01:00:19,650
<i>Yes, because the bioform
would survive the journey.</i>

717
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,234
To die on being resuscitated.

718
01:00:23,317 --> 01:00:26,900
<i>The bioform would survive
between three hours and ten days.</i>

719
01:00:26,984 --> 01:00:29,567
MILO, limit results to
only processes that can be interrupted

720
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:31,775
without reducing life expectancy.

721
01:00:33,442 --> 01:00:36,150
<i>No non-priority processes
can be interrupted</i>

722
01:00:36,234 --> 01:00:37,984
<i>without reducing life expectancy.</i>

723
01:00:38,984 --> 01:00:40,442
Difficult choices.

724
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,359
Find what triggers the memories.

725
01:00:45,317 --> 01:00:46,650
Come on, come on.

726
01:00:46,734 --> 01:00:48,942
If you have something to say,
now's the time.

727
01:01:22,234 --> 01:01:23,650
I'm out of my mind.

728
01:01:30,442 --> 01:01:34,692
<i>Warning, any deliberate damage

<i>is a European federal offense
punishable by ten years imprisonment.</i>

730
01:01:38,192 --> 01:01:39,900
So go on, electrocute me.

731
01:01:39,984 --> 01:01:41,900
Ahh!

732
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:04,775

01:02:41,275 --> 01:02:43,275
Ahh!

738
01:02:45,817 --> 01:02:50,984
Don't you worry.
We'll meet again.

739
01:03:09,692 --> 01:03:11,525
And that's our entry system.

740
01:03:22,859 --> 01:03:26,484
MILO, search for Alice Hansen in Paris.

741

<i>One result.</i>

742

<i>Sweetheart?
Is that you?</i>

749
01:04:00,359 --> 01:04:02,275
<i>Oh, what's wrong?</i>

750
01:04:03,109 --> 01:04:04,317
<i>I think...</i>

01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:09,317
<i>What?
I can't hear you...</i>

752
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,400
I just wanted to hear your voice.

753
01:04:15,109 --> 01:04:18,525
<i>Liz, my love, what's going on?</i>

754
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,067
I don't think anyone will come.

755
01:04:26,859 --> 01:04:30,275
<i>Who won't come?
Is everything all...</i>

756
01:04:33,067 --> 01:04:35,984
I tried to find him.
I don't know where else to look.

757
01:04:36,067 --> 01:04:38,150
I'm supposed to know, but I don't.

<i>It's not good for you,

760
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:52,525
<i>I'll come to see you.
No, even better, you come here.</i>

761
01:04:53,192 --> 01:04:56,192
<i>Spend a little time with me.</i>

762
01:04:56,275 --> 01:04:58,025

01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,192
when I'm over all of this.

938
01:21:05,275 --> 01:21:07,734
<i>Alert. Oxygen level, 3%.</i>

939
01:21:07,817 --> 01:21:09,734
- What's going on?
- <i>Interruption.</i>

940
01:21:09,817 --> 01:21:11,734
What does that mean?

941
01:21:11,817 --> 01:21:12,817
What does that mean?

942
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:15,859
<i>Chance of survival
below acceptable parameters.</i>

943
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:18,359
<i>CEP launched.</i>

944
01:21:18,442 --> 01:21:20,817
- <i>One minute to administration.</i>
- What's CEP?

945
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:22,734
<i>Charitable Euthanasia Protocol.</i>

946
01:21:22,817 --> 01:21:24,275
- What?
- <i>Fifty-eight.</i>

947
01:21:24,359 --> 01:21:25,734
- Ignore it.
- <i>Fifty-seven.</i>

948
01:21:25,817 --> 01:21:28,400
- <i>The CEP order can't be ignored.</i>
- Ignore!

- <i>49, 48...</i>
- But it's disconnected!

<i>Secondary unit

- <i>42, 41... Instruction unknown.</i>

954
01:21:46,275 --> 01:21:48,609
- Release the harness.
- <i>Instruction unknown. 39...</i>

955
01:21:48,692 --> 01:21:49,984
Release the safety belt.

<i>Instruction unknown. 35, 34...</i>

957

968
01:22:44,484 --> 01:22:48,484
<i>Heart rate high.
Would you like a sedative?</i>

969
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:55,317
You need my authorization for a sedative,
but not for a lethal injection?

970
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,984
Are you still recording the message?

971
01:22:58,067 --> 01:23:02,734
<i>Yes. I am still recording
a message for Omicron 42.</i>

972
01:23:02,817 --> 01:23:06,317
Léo, can you hear what I'm forced
to put up with? I mean, seriously...

973
01:23:07,567 --> 01:23:14,234
MILO, which processor controls
the euthanasia protocols?

974
01:23:15,442 --> 01:23:20,234
<i>Processor 67-526
is assigned to all disaster scenarios.</i>

975
01:23:20,317 --> 01:23:22,400
All scenarios
where you're supposed to kill me?

976
01:23:22,484 --> 01:23:24,567
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Deactivate it.

977
01:23:24,650 --> 01:23:28,984
<i>Deactivation of disaster scenarios
is contrary to the United Nations ruling</i>

978
01:23:29,067 --> 01:23:31,192
<i>concerning the Ethics of Medical Practice.</i>

979
01:23:31,275 --> 01:23:34,609
In other words, if we deactivate,

980
01:23:34,692 --> 01:23:37,775
you won't be able to kill me,
even if I beg you to?

981
01:23:37,859 --> 01:23:39,192
<i>Affirmative.</i>

982
01:23:42,567 --> 01:23:44,942
Okay.
Deactivate them.

983
01:23:46,109 --> 01:23:50,025
And redirect
all remaining functions of processor 3-54.

984
01:23:51,025 --> 01:23:53,150
<i>Deactivation of disaster scenarios.</i>

985
01:23:56,900 --> 01:24:01,192
<i>All functions
of processor 3-54 are now reassigned.</i>

986
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:10,484
Okay. Launch the return
to hypersleep protocol for the bioform.

987
01:24:12,192 --> 01:24:15,900
<i>Implementation impossible,
bioform disconnected.</i>

988
01:24:18,109 --> 01:24:20,609
<i>Intravenous assistance unhooked.</i>

989
01:24:20,692 --> 01:24:25,650
<i>Medical umbilical ring unhooked.
Cerebral activity unhooked.</i>

990
01:24:28,859 --> 01:24:32,359
Okay. Think.
Think of the easiest thing.

991
01:24:33,067 --> 01:24:34,942
Does the bioform need two IVs?

992
01:24:35,025 --> 01:24:40,109
<i>Affirmative. P1 for nutriments,
P2 for hypersleep management.</i>

993
01:24:40,192 --> 01:24:41,734
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

994
01:25:05,317 --> 01:25:08,192
It's going to go away.

995
01:25:08,775 --> 01:25:10,817
It's not real.

996
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:12,442
Not real, it's not real.

997
01:25:14,775 --> 01:25:17,275
It wasn't me! It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

998
01:25:19,109 --> 01:25:20,317
I didn't clone you.

999
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:39,359
<i>Oxygen level, 2%.</i>

1000
01:26:08,984 --> 01:26:10,984
<i>Intravenous P2 connected.</i>

1001
01:26:20,609 --> 01:26:22,234
Okay.

1002
01:26:51,067 --> 01:26:53,942
<i>Medical umbilical ring connected.</i>

1003
01:27:14,067 --> 01:27:17,400
Okay.
Come on, come on, come on.

1004
01:27:29,984 --> 01:27:32,192
<i>Intravenous P1 connected.</i>

1005
01:27:38,484 --> 01:27:40,400
<i>Two electrodes inactive.</i>

1006
01:28:03,775 --> 01:28:07,275
<i>Cerebral activity monitor connected.</i>

1007
01:28:07,359 --> 01:28:09,775
<i>Oxygen level, 1%.</i>

1008
01:28:22,609 --> 01:28:25,734
MILO, do I stand a chance
of surviving resuscitation?

1009
01:28:25,817 --> 01:28:30,109
<i>No. An oxygen level of 2%
is the strict minimum for resuscitation.</i>

1010
01:28:35,692 --> 01:28:40,650
I imagine the promise was that
we'd wake together,

1011
01:28:40,734 --> 01:28:42,775
but I won't be there.

1012
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,025
I've tried everything.

1013
01:28:46,359 --> 01:28:47,692
I'm not the only one lost...

1014
01:28:49,817 --> 01:28:52,109
I'm not the only one lost,
there are others.

1015
01:28:53,859 --> 01:28:54,859
There are others.

1016
01:28:58,275 --> 01:29:00,025
MILO, end of recording.

1017
01:29:01,192 --> 01:29:02,734
<i>Recording ended.</i>

1018
01:29:03,984 --> 01:29:05,150
Goodbye, Léo.

1019
01:29:13,442 --> 01:29:16,317
<i>Oxygen level, 0.6%.</i>

1020
01:29:38,275 --> 01:29:41,067
The others!

1021
01:29:41,942 --> 01:29:46,400
MILO, how much oxygen
is left in the lost units?

1022
01:29:46,484 --> 01:29:49,317
<i>187 lost units are at full capacity.</i>

1023
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:52,775
Divert the oxygen
from the lost units to unit 267.

1024
01:29:52,859 --> 01:29:55,109
<i>Diversion impossible to carry out now.</i>

1025
01:29:55,192 --> 01:29:59,692
<i>Access to individual oxygen reserves
is limited for security reasons.</i>

1026
01:30:00,692 --> 01:30:03,942
<i>It will require
approximately 14,227 minutes</i>

1027
01:30:04,025 --> 01:30:06,734
<i>to ignore the security restriction.</i>

1028
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:10,775
<i>It is recommended
placing the bioform in hypersleep</i>

1029
01:30:10,859 --> 01:30:13,275
<i>for reasons of preservation
during the maneuver.</i>

1030
01:30:18,817 --> 01:30:20,359
Can you do that, MILO?

1031
01:30:20,442 --> 01:30:23,442
<i>Do you want to begin
the return to hypersleep protocol</i>

1032
01:30:23,525 --> 01:30:25,150
<i>while I carry out the maneuver?</i>

1033
01:30:29,984 --> 01:30:30,984
Yes.

1034
01:30:32,650 --> 01:30:36,109
I could kiss you right now. Yes.

1035
01:30:37,234 --> 01:30:39,484
Launch the hypersleep protocol.

1036
01:30:40,859 --> 01:30:43,484
<i>Return to hypersleep protocol launched.</i>

1037

<i>Would you like a sedative?</i>

1038
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:52,525
Yes.

1043
01:31:15,775 --> 01:31:17,567
MILO, I'm sorry for hitting you.

1044
01:31:19,359 --> 01:31:20,775
<i>Apology accepted.</i>

1045
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:25,942
MILO, tell me about the planet.

1046
01:31:27,567 --> 01:31:28,442
What's it like?

1047
01:31:28,525 --> 01:31:32,109
<i>Wolf 10-61c
has an orbital cycle of 18 days.</i>

1048
01:31:32,192 --> 01:31:34,900
<i>Its mass is around four times
that of Earth.</i>

1049
01:31:34,984 --> 01:31:38,067
<i>Its lack of rotation makes life impossible</i>

1050
01:31:38,150 --> 01:31:42,359
<i>on its sun-facing side, which is too hot,
and on its dark side, which is too cold.</i>

1051
01:31:42,442 --> 01:31:46,192
<i>The habitable area is therefore
on the border of day and night.</i>

1052
01:31:48,109 --> 01:31:49,692
Tell me about the journey.

1053
01:31:51,109 --> 01:31:53,817
<i>Once nuclear-powered thrust is engaged,</i>

1054

<i>that will enter

1058
01:32:10,567 --> 01:32:12,692
<i>Thanks to their
individual helix-shaped device...</i>

1059
01:32:12,775 --> 01:32:16,692
MILO, tell me about the beach in Maui.

1060
01:32:17,817 --> 01:32:21,400
<i>Kapalua Bay is a white sand beach
