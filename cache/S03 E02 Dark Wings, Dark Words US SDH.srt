Don't think
too much, Bran.

7
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,749
Relax your bow arm.

00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:55,550
- ( caws )

00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,760
Ned:
<i>And which one of you</i>

10
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,095

<i>( raven caws )</i>

12

You can't kill it,
you know.

13
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,108
Why not?

14
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,613
Because the raven is you.

15
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,658

Hodor.

18
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,375
It's all right, Hodor.

19
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,753
( sighs )
Hodor.

20
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,510
Osha:
<i>Were you inside the wolf</i>
<i>again, little lord?</i>

21
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,472
No, it was
the three-eyed raven.

22
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,724
<i>He's back.</i>

23
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,019
I tried to kill it,
but I couldn't.

24
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,772
- There was a boy.
-<i> I don't want to hear</i>
<i>about it.</i>

25
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,107
- But you asked.
- We've got plenty
of worries.

26
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,443
We don't need to pour
black magic on top of them.

27
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,905
I didn't ask
for black magic dreams.

28
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,698
I know you didn't,
little lord.

29
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,533
<i>( birds screeching )</i>

30
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,369
We need to move.

31
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,162
We don't know
who might be after us.

32
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:07,830
No one even knows
we're alive.

33
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:10,792
And who told you that?

34
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,044
<i>The three-eyed raven</i>
<i>tell you?</i>

35
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,963
- No.
- Some good he is, then.

36
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,426
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what other people know</i>
<i>and what they don't.</i>

37
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,429
I only know the Wall
is a long way off.

38
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,816
My mother
always told me

39
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,235
you Westerosi
were a grim lot.

40
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,572
Grim, bearded,

41
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,324
stinking barbarians

42
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,284
that would row
across the Narrow Sea

43
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,579
and steal us
from our beds.

44
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,623
Did you ever think
you'd marry one?

45
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,336
I never thought
I'd marry anyone at all.

46
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,505
Never?

47
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:01,175
Not until I met
the king of the grim,

48
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,386
bearded,
stinking barbarians.

49
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,055
<i>( door opens )</i>

50
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,311
Pardon me, Your Grace.

51
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,148
- My queen.
- Lord Bolton.

52
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,318
Let me guess which one
is the good news.

53
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,698
Word from Riverrun

54
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,408
and Winterfell.

55
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,665
( crying )
I hadn't seen
him in years.

56
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,878
I don't even know
how many.

57
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,131
We'll travel
to the funeral together.

58
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,842
<i>Lord Bolton</i>
<i>will garrison here</i>

59
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,178
<i>until we return.</i>

60
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,890
Will I be wearing manacles
when I lay my father to rest?

61
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,606
Something else?

62
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,401
By the time Bolton's
bastard got to Winterfell,

63
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,195
the ironborn were gone.

64
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:07,450
<i>They massacred everyone</i>
<i>and put the castle</i>
<i>to the torch.</i>

65
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,663
And Bran and Rickon
have not been found.

66
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,795
They may have escaped.

67
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:22,131
Or Theon may have taken
them back to the Iron
Islands as hostages.

68
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,425
Have you received
any demands?

69
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,969
No.

70
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,430
Have you heard anything
from Theon at all?

71
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,728
( gasps )

72
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,481
( shivering )

73
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,454
Where am I?

74
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,671
Who are you?

75
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,095
What do you want?

76
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,139
I want to do this.

77
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,474
( screaming )

78
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,312
Do you know how long
it's going to take us

79
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,315
to get to King's
Landing walking through
fields and forests?

80
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,733
Yes.

81
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,193
<i>( sheep bleating )</i>

82
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,695
So how shall
we pass the time?

83
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,405
By putting one foot
in front of the other.

84
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,490
It's going to be
a very dull walk.

85
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,284
I'm here to take you
to King's Landing

86
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,078
and bring back
Lady Stark's daughters
in exchange.

87
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,164
Dull is fine.

88
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,958
You know, it doesn't matter
how loyal a servant you are,

89
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,003
no one enjoys the company
of a humorless mute.

90
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,462
Trust me on this.

91
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,673
People have been serving me
since I was born.

92
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:49,010
You think Lady Stark
is going to want a giant
towheaded plank

93
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,304
following her around
for the rest of her life?

94
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:55,016
A week's journey with you
and she'll order you to
fall on your sword.

95
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:58,853
If Lady Stark is unhappy
with any aspect of my service,

96
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,521
I'm sure
she'll let me know.

97
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,231
She's an honest woman.

98
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,192
All the good
it's done her.

99
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,405
( moans )

100
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:12,533
How did you come into
Lady Stark's service?

101
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,160
There's something
we can talk about.

102
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,120
Not your concern,
Kingslayer.

103
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,538
It had to be recently.

104
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,624
You weren't with her
at Winterfell.

105
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,167
How would you know?

106
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,878
Because I visited
Winterfell.

107
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,796
I would have noticed
your dour head

108
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,715
smacking into
the archways.

109
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,175
Move.

110
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,391
- Were you pledged
to Stannis?
- Gods, no.

111
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,185
Ah, Renly.

112
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,770
Really?

113
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,647
He wasn't fit
to rule over anything

114
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,357
more important than
a 12-course meal.

115
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,275
- Shut your mouth.
- Why?

116
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,403
I lived with him
at court since he was
a boy, don't forget.

117
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,489
Could hardly escape
the little tulip.

118
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,408
Skipping down the corridors
in his embroidered silks.

119
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,244
I knew him
far better than you.

120
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,246
I knew him
as well as anyone.

121
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,956
As a member
of his Kingsguard,

122
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,624
he trusted me
with everything.

123
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,167
He would have been
a wonderful king.

124
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,752
Sounds like you
quite fancied him.

125
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,088
I did not
fancy him.

126
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,589
Oh, gods, you did.

127
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,550
<i>Did you ever tell him?</i>

128
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,470
No, of course not.

129
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:17,348
You weren't Renly's
type, I'm afraid.

130
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:21,269
He preferred
curly-haired little
girls like Loras Tyrell.

131
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,645
You're far too much
man for him.

132
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,397
I'm not interested
in foul rumors.

133
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,440
Unless they're
about me.

134
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,776
It's all true
about Renly.

135
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,737
His proclivities
were the worst kept
secret at court.

136
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,115
It's a shame the throne
isn't made out of cocks.

137
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,159
- They'd have
never got him off it.
- Shut your mouth!

138
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,621
I don't blame him.

139
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,748
And I don't
blame you, either.

140
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:46,043
We don't get to choose
who we love.

141
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,671
<i>( horse snorts )</i>

142
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,141
- Where are you headed, then?
- Jaime: South.

143
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,143
- You?
- Riverrun.

144
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,354
Staying off
the kingsroad, are you?

145
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,440
They get you no matter
where you go.

146
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,108
- You can't win.
- No, you really can't.

147
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,444
Looks like you're
safe enough, though.

148
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,029
Meaning no offense,
my lady, but...

149
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,489
( laughs )
I wouldn't tangle
with you.

150
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,491
( laughs )

151
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,410
- Seven blessings to you.
- And you.

152
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,544
Jaime:
<i>He knows who I am.</i>

153
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:30,171
- He doesn't.
- Maybe you're right.

154
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,882
But what if you're not?
What if he tells someone?

155
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,762
We're not doing it.

156
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,056
<i>He's an innocent man.</i>

157
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,808
More innocent than
Lady Stark's daughters?

158
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,572
Make it tighter here.

159
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,033
That's better.

160
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,203
<i>It makes you look</i>
<i>very strong.</i>

161
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,205
No flowers.

162
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,540
I said no flowers.

163
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,044
All these are wrong.
Bring others.

164
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,921
Yes, Your Grace.

165
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,007
Bloody flowers.

166
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,009
On the king.

167
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,886
Looks like
a Tyrell rose.

168
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,306
Give it to Margaery
for her wedding gown.

169
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,600
Should be more
than enough fabric.

170
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,649
Tell me what
you think of her.

171
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,900
Who?

172
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,860
Margaery.

173
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,737
She's an ideal match.

174
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,739
With the Tyrells beside us,

175
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,908
we'll crush the Northerners.

176
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,203
Hang their lords,
burn their strongholds,

177
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,955
sow their fields
with salt,

178
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,707
and no one will think
of rebelling for
another century.

179
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,629
It is a good match,
but what do you
think of her?

180
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,677
She's beautiful
and intelligent.

181
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,554
Yes, she is.

182
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:05,307
Her concern with
the well-being of the common
people is interesting.

183
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,810
Not to me.

184
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,603
( chuckles )

185
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,231
I only meant that
to go out of your way
to endanger yourself--

186
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,275
This is becoming
one of the most boring

187
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,777
conversations
I've ever had.

188
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,784
Margaery Tyrell dotes
on filthy urchins
for a reason.

189
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:27,288
She dresses like
a harlot for a reason.

190
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,331
She married a traitor
and known degenerate

191
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,000
like Renly Baratheon
for a reason.

192
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,503
She married Renly Baratheon
because she was told to.

193
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,256
That's what
intelligent women do--

194
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,216
what they're told.

195
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,973
- You need to ask yourself--
- I don't need to do anything.

196
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,485
( sighs )

197
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,361
Better.

198
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,490
Much better.

199
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,909
I still
don't believe it.

200
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,785
He didn't.
He didn't want anything.

201
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,498
He just takes an interest
because he loved my mother.

202
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,127
Men only want one thing
from a pretty girl.

203
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,341
Littlefinger's not
in love with me.

204
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,803
Love is not
the thing he wants.

205
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,140
He's too old.

206
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,559
They never see it
that way.

207
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,233
He didn't ask you
to do something for him?

208
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,610
Spy on someone or...?

209
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,570
No.

210
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,870
If he does ask you
for anything

211
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,789
or try anything

212
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:55,209
or touch you,
I want you to tell me.

213
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,963
Why?
What will you do?

214
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,756
I will make him stop.

215
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,967
<i>( knocks )</i>

216
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,843
Guard:
<i>Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.</i>

217
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,221
Send him in.

218
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,982
Lady Sansa.

219
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,316
Ser Loras.

220
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,901
My sister Margaery
invites you to take

221
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,486
the air with her
and our grandmother

222
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,488
the Lady Olenna
in the gardens.

223
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,157
May I escort you
to them?

224
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,709
I believe you
grow more beautiful
every day, Lady Sansa.

225
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,877
You are too kind,
Ser Loras.

226
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,842
You probably don't remember
the first time we met.

227
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,346
At the Hand's tourney,
you gave me your favor.

228
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,142
A rose,
a red rose.

229
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,893
Of course I did.

230
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,273
Margaery:
<i>It's more your color.</i>

231
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,109
- You take it.
- Thank you.

232
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,028
You're such a dear.

233
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,113
I'll take my leave.

234
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,073
Lady Sansa.

235
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,159
Thank you,
Ser Loras.

236
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,244
Come.

237
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,794
Lady Sansa,
it is my honor

238
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,796
to present
my grandmother...

239
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,300
the Lady Olenna
of House Tyrell.

240
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,302
Kiss me, child.

241
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,387
It's so good of you
to visit me

242
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,514
and my foolish
flock of hens.

243
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,808
We're very sorry
for your losses.

244
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,479
And I was sorry when
I heard of Lord Renly's
death, Lady Margaery.

245
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,564
- He was very gallant.
- Gallant, yes.

246
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,816
And charming
and very clean.

247
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,735
He knew how
to dress and smile

248
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,655
and somehow this
gave him the notion
he was fit to be king.

249
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,657
Renly was brave
and gentle, Grandmother.

250
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,575
Father liked him
and so did Loras.

251
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,118
Loras is young
and very good

252
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,120
at knocking men
off horses with a stick.

253
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,831
That does not
make him wise.

254
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,416
As to your
fathead father--

255
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,044
Grandmother!
What will Sansa
think of us?

256
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,421
<i>She might think we have</i>
<i>some wits about us.</i>

257
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,340
One of us,
at any rate.

258
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,967
It was treason.
I warned them.

259
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,054
Robert has
two sons and Renly
has an older brother.

260
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,181
How could he possibly
have any claim

261
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,725
to that ugly
iron chair?

262
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,812
We should have stayed
well out of all this
if you ask me.

263
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,605
But once
the cow's been milked,

264
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,400
there's no squirting
the cream back up her udders.

265
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,235
So here we are
to see things through.

266
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,196
What do you say
to that, Sansa?

267
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,199
Shall we have
some lemon cakes?

268
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,784
Lemon cake's my favorite.

269
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,911
So we've been told.

270
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:39,373
Are you going to bring
the food or do you mean
to starve us to death?

271
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,334
Here, Sansa,

272
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,461
come sit with me.

273
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,798
I'm much less boring
than these others.

274
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,594
Do you know my son?

275
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,388
The Lord of Highgarden?

276
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,724
I haven't had
the pleasure.

277
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,726
No great pleasure,
believe me.

278
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,310
A ponderous oaf.

279
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,271
<i>His father</i>
<i>was an oaf as well.</i>

280
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,065
<i>My husband,</i>
<i>the late Lord Luthor.</i>

281
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,068
He managed to ride off
a cliff whilst hawking.

282
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,279
They say he was looking
up at the sky

283
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,824
and paying no mind to where
his horse was taking him.

284
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,743
And now my son
is doing the same,

285
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:19,580
only this time
he's riding a lion
instead of a horse.

286
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,249
Now...

287
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,460
I want you
to tell me the truth

288
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,589
about this royal boy,
this Joffrey.

289
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,841
I... I...

290
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,301
You, you.

291
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,011
Who else
would know better?

292
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,805
We've heard
some troubling tales.

293
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,558
Is there any truth
to them?

294
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,977
<i>Has this boy</i>
<i>mistreated you?</i>

295
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,438
Has he ripped out
your tongue?

296
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,940
Joff-- King Joffrey,

297
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,235
he-- His Grace
is very fair

298
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,405
and handsome
and as brave as a lion.

299
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,866
Yes, all Lannisters
are lions.

300
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:59,578
And when a Tyrell farts,
it smells like a rose.

301
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,955
<i>But how kind is he?</i>
<i>How clever?</i>

302
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,458
Has he a good heart,
a gentle hand?

303
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,918
I'm to be his wife.

304
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,170
I only want to know
what that means.

305
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,256
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

306
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,554
Bring me some cheese.

307
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,890
The cheese will be served
after the cakes, my lady.

308
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,142
The cheese will be served
when I want it served.

309
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,727
And I want it served now.

310
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,983
Are you frightened, child?

311
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,069
No need for that.

312
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,737
We're only women here.

313
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:37,157
Tell us the truth.
No harm will come to you.

314
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:41,161
My father always
told the truth.

315
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,288
Yes, he had
that reputation.

316
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,833
And they named him traitor
and took his head.

317
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,836
Joffrey.

318
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,712
Joffrey did that.

319
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,174
He promised he would
be merciful and he cut
my father's head off.

320
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,968
And he said
that was mercy.

321
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,763
Then he took me up
on the walls and made me
look at it.

322
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,811
Go on.

323
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,982
I-- I can't.
I never meant--

324
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,234
my father was a traitor.

325
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,695
My brother as well.
I have traitor's blood.

326
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,488
Please don't make me
say anymore.

327
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,990
She's terrified,
Grandmother.

328
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,326
- Just look at her.
- Speak freely, child.

329
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,163
We would never betray
your confidence,
I swear it.

330
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,043
He's a monster.

331
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,172
Ah.

332
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,048
<i>That's a pity.</i>

333
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,009
Please, don't stop
the wedding.

334
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,220
Have no fear.
The Lord Oaf of Highgarden

335
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,015
<i>is determined that</i>
<i>Margaery shall be queen.</i>

336
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:46,476
Even so, we thank you
for the truth.

337
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,438
Ah, here comes my cheese.

338
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,451
( panting )

339
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:06,622
Karstark:
<i>We're at war.</i>

340
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,166
<i>This march</i>
<i>is a distraction.</i>

341
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,336
My grandfather's funeral
is not a distraction.

342
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,255
- Are we riding
to battle at Riverrun?
- No.

343
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,424
Then it's a distraction.

344
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,719
My Uncle Edmure
has his forces
garrisoned there.

345
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,262
We need his men.

346
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,640
Unless he's been
breeding them,

347
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,767
he don't have enough
to make a difference.

348
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,519
Have you lost faith
in our cause?

349
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:33,190
If it's revenge,
I still got faith in it.

350
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,900
If you no longer
believe--

351
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,569
I can believe
till it snows in Dorne.

352
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:41,365
Don't change the fact
that we've got half the men.

353
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,619
You don't think
we can win?

354
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,788
May I speak my mind,
Your Grace?

355
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:51,291
Have you not been
speaking your mind,
Lord Karstark?

356
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,211
I think you lost this war

357
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,463
the day you married her.

358
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,388
<i>( horse whinnies )</i>

359
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,016
Whoa, whoa.

360
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,269
Your Grace.

361
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,563
You're afraid of her.

362
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,608
- And she knows it.
- I'm not afraid of her.

363
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,821
( snorting )

364
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,829
May I help you,
Lady Stark?

365
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,247
No.

366
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,833
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have--

367
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,459
You can't help
because a mother

368
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,546
makes one
for her children
to protect them.

369
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,717
Only a mother
can make them.

370
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,642
You've made them
before?

371
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,229
Twice.

372
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:56,273
Did they work?

373
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,694
After a fashion.

374
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,742
I prayed for my son Bran
to survive his fall.

375
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,497
Many years before that,

376
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,666
one of the boys came down
with the pox.

377
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,296
Maester Luwin said
if he made it through
the night, he'd live.

378
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:23,091
But it would be
a very long night.

379
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,972
So I sat with him
all through the darkness.

380
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:33,226
Listened to his ragged
little breaths,

381
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,188
his coughing,
his whimpering.

382
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,482
<i>Which boy?</i>

383
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,443
Jon Snow.

384
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,573
When my husband brought
that baby home from the war,

385
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,617
I couldn't bear
to look at him.

386
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,411
I didn't want
to see those brown

387
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,331
<i>stranger's eyes</i>
<i>staring up at me.</i>

388
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,417
<i>So I prayed to the gods,</i>
<i>take him away.</i>

389
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,961
Make him die.

390
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,007
He got the pox.

391
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:11,098
<i>And I knew I was the worst</i>
<i>woman who ever lived.</i>

392
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,143
A murderer.

393
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,314
I'd condemned this poor,
innocent child

394
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,817
to a horrible death

395
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,361
all because I was
jealous of his mother.

396
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,864
A woman he didn't
even know.

397
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:31,243
So I prayed
to all seven gods,

398
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:34,204
let the boy live.

399
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,790
Let him live

400
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,834
and I'll love him.

401
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,129
I'll be a mother to him.

402
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,882
I'll beg my husband
to give him a true name,

403
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,969
to call him Stark
and be done with it,

404
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,470
to make him one of us.

405
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,848
And he lived.

406
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,516
And he lived.

407
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,938
And I couldn't keep
my promise.

408
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,112
<i>And everything</i>
<i>that's happened since then...</i>

409
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,867
<i>all this horror</i>
<i>that's come to my family...</i>

410
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,206
it's all because I couldn't
love a motherless child.

411
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,553
Was it hard for you
to kill the Halfhand?

412
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,140
Yes.

413
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,601
You liked him?

414
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,520
I like you, but if
you're playing us false,

415
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,439
it won't be hard
for me to kill you.

416
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,149
I've got wildling
blood in my veins.

417
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:47,360
- These are my people.
- I understand.

418
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,238
Well, how could
you understand?

419
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,490
You want to protect
your people.

420
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,660
Do you know what it takes
to unite 90 clans,

421
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,954
half of whom want
to massacre the other half

422
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,498
for one insult or another?

423
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:04,211
They speak seven different
languages in my army.

424
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,379
<i>The Thenns hate</i>
<i>the Hornfoots.</i>

425
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,215
<i>The Hornfoots hate</i>
<i>the ice-river clans.</i>

426
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,842
Everyone hates
the cave people.

427
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,387
So you know how I got
moon worshippers

428
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,306
and cannibals and giants

429
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,808
to march together
in the same army?

430
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,143
No.

431
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:23,063
I told them we were
all going to die

432
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,065
if we don't get south.

433
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,108
Because that's the truth.

434
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,789
Shouldn't be long now.

435
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,585
( screeching )

436
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,094
What's wrong with him?

437
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,346
Mance:
<i>He's a warg.</i>

438
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,391
He can enter
the mind of animals,
see through their eyes.

439
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,934
He's scouting for us.

440
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,645
What, you've never
met a warg?

441
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,695
( screeching )

442
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,948
Mance:
<i>Orell.</i>

443
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,450
( shivers )

444
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:27,210
Where were you
this time?

445
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,676
The Fist
of the First Men.

446
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,928
What did you see?

447
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,724
( chuckles )

448
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,476
Dead crows.

449
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,358
( men coughing )

450
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,362
Rast:
What's the matter, Piggy?

451
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,448
You crying
'cause you're cold?

452
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:03,163
There's 200 brothers
killed by dead men

453
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,623
and you're still here

454
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,335
whimpering.

455
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,378
That seem fair to you?

456
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,590
I seen 'em torn
to pieces fighting

457
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,176
while you was off
somewhere hiding
in a hole.

458
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,347
Why don't you lie down
and rest for a while, eh?

459
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,933
You know you want to.

460
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,869
Hey.

461
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,709
Get up, Sam.

462
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,337
- No.
-<i> Get up.</i>

463
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,047
I can't.

464
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,633
If you stop,
you'll die.

465
00:27:56,716 --> 00:28:00,387
'Course if you don't stop,
you'll probably die, too.

466
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,556
- You don't care.
- 'Course we care.

467
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,892
You left me.

468
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:09,270
When the white walkers came,
you left me.

469
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,272
Aye, we left you.

470
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,317
<i>You're fat and you're slow.</i>

471
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,569
We didn't want to die.

472
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,405
<i>( Sam sobbing )</i>

473
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,739
Help me get him up.

474
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,034
Looks like that piggy
is done for.

475
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,203
- Help us get him up.
- He's slowing us down.

476
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,913
Just get him up!

477
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,749
Why? So the rest
of us can die?

478
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,545
We'll move faster
without him.

479
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:37,090
What is this?
Get up, Tarly.

480
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,885
- Is he all right?
- Aye, I think so.

481
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,096
If he can't,
we may as well
just go without him.

482
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,764
That's enough.

483
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,808
Tarly,

484
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,144
I forbid you to die.

485
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,521
Do you hear me?

486
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,274
- Why should
the rest of us--
- Rast...

487
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,609
you're responsible
for him.

488
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,695
What am I
supposed to do?

489
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,822
Make sure he gets
back alive.

490
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,575
If he doesn't,
you don't.

491
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,703
Move on!

492
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,794
I'm not dying
for you, Piggy.

493
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,754
You hear me?

494
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,777
-<i> ( branch snaps )</i>
<i>- ( wolf growling )</i>

495
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,948
Where's Rickon
and Hodor?

496
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,160
Looking for food.

497
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,953
( growling )

498
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,789
What's out there?

499
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,767
( growling )

500
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,047
( growling )

501
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,341
Osha:
<i>Not another step, boy.</i>

502
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,718
<i>Unless you want to drown</i>
<i>in your own blood.</i>

503
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:46,970
I'm unarmed.

504
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,889
That was poor planning.

505
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,058
My sister carries
the weapons.

506
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:56,646
I'm better with them.

507
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,065
<i>Drop the spear.</i>

508
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,570
<i>Drop it.</i>

509
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,241
If you kill me,

510
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,827
that wolf will tear
you to bits.

511
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,374
( growling )

512
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,168
You must be Summer.

513
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,675
( sniffing )

514
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,652
I'm Jojen Reed.

515
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,614
This is my sister Meera.

516
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,412
We've come a long way
to find you, Brandon.

517
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,249
And we have
much farther to go.

518
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,755
Gendry:
I'm just trying
to understand.

519
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,466
Arya:
Would you please
shut up about it?

520
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,134
Jaqen H'ghar offered
you three kills.

521
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,762
- I'm not listening.
- But just explain it to me.

522
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,473
He offered to kill
any three people you wanted.

523
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,100
Dead. All you had to do
was give him the names.

524
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,603
Anyone.
You could have
picked King Joffrey.

525
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,938
- Shut up.
- You could have picked
Tywin Lannister.

526
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,565
Jaqen got us
out of Harrenhal,

527
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,275
so why are you
complaining?

528
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,943
But you could have
ended the war.

529
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,613
- Where are we going?
- North.

530
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,073
If we were going north,

531
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,116
we should have come
to the Red Fork
River by now.

532
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,035
Maybe we already
passed it.

533
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,578
It's 100 feet wide.

534
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,789
How could we have
passed it?

535
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,333
If we hit the Red Fork,

536
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,834
we can follow it west
to Riverrun.

537
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,294
My mother grew up there.

538
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,797
My grandfather's a lord.
He'll protect us.

539
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,758
<i>( man singing )</i>

540
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,301
Could be a minstrel.

541
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,637
Shut up.

00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:00,520

00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,046

<i>- Don't.</i>

556
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,399
Put the sword down, girl.

557
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,901
You go on down the road.

558
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,945
Just keep on singing
so we know where you are.

559
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:54,741
Leave us be
and I won't kill you.

560
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,577
( laughing )

561
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,370
Generous.

562
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,873
You're a dangerous person.

563
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,459
I like dangerous people.

564
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:09,464
Why are your friends
so shy?

565
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,633
What friends?

566
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,636
The fat one to your left
and the lad beside him.

567
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,618
Three young ones
on the run

568
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:42,163
carrying
castle-forged swords.

569
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,623
You escape
from Harrenhal?

570
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,292
- Arya:<i> Who are you?</i>
<i>- Thoros of Myr.</i>

571
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,377
And the fellow here
with the bow is Anguy.

572
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,879
No, who do you
fight for?

573
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,923
<i>The Brotherhood</i>
<i>without Banners.</i>

574
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,469
Now come along.

575
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:57,929
I want to hear
how two boys

576
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:01,766
and a very dangerous girl
escaped Harrenhal.

577
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,143
I'm not going with them.
The Brotherhood?

578
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,479
That's who the Mountain
and them lot were looking for.

579
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,189
They'll bring us back
and put rats in us.

580
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,233
You've got nothing
to fear from us, son.

581
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:13,152
The lords of Westeros
want to burn the countryside.

582
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,112
We're trying to save it.

583
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,781
Now come on.

584
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,200
We'll talk some more
over brown bread and stew.

585
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,619
And then you can go
on your way.

586
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,587
Here's the thing, fat boy.

587
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,467
When I'm done talking,

588
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,262
that arrow's falling down
on your fat head.

589
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:42,765
So I advise you move,
because I'm done talking.

590
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,482
( men laughing )

591
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,908
Half the country's starving
and look at this one.

592
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,411
Maybe he's the reason
half the country's starving.

593
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,339
My lion.

594
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:19,051
We've spoken of this.

595
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,846
You cannot come here.

596
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,894
But you said I should come
to you with any problems.

597
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,687
Did anyone see you?

598
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,898
- No.
- You sure?

599
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,192
My father does not
make idle threats.

600
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,570
Having you killed would be
the high point of his week.

601
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,780
You have to be
absolutely certain.

602
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,244
All right.

603
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,455
What is this problem?

604
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,292
I'm worried about Sansa.

605
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,127
When she spoke
with Lord Baelish,

606
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,464
his friend warned me
about him.

607
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,633
Baelish doesn't
have friends.

608
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,552
I don't know her name.

609
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,680
- Oh, Ros? The redhead?
- How do you know her?

610
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,766
I try to know
as many people as I can.

611
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,726
You never know
which one you'll need.

612
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,519
She's a whore.

613
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,522
Yes, well, we shouldn't
be judgmental about
these things.

614
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,943
- You fucked her.
- Oh, please.

615
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,612
All right, yes,
I fucked her once.

616
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,240
Twice.

617
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,453
But since I met you,
my lady,

618
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,997
I've been with
no one else.

619
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,127
And was she good?
Did you like her?

620
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,837
Not as much
as I like you, obviously,

621
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,507
or she'd be the one
torturing me right now.

622
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,471
What did she say
about Littlefinger?

623
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,642
That Sansa
shouldn't trust him.

624
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,603
Is there an idiot
in any village

625
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,480
who trusts Littlefinger?

626
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:58,693
We have to protect her.

627
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,111
We can't.

628
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,322
Now that the Lannisters
have discarded her,

629
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,574
Sansa will have
many suitors.

630
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,911
A great beauty
with a very old name.

631
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,872
A great beauty?
Oh, a great beauty?

632
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,334
Yes, she is,
objectively, very.

633
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,503
Her face
is quite pleasing--

634
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,338
to other men
and to women,

635
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,298
people in general.

636
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,175
But not to me,
of course.

637
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,470
I only have eyes
for you.

638
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,931
You pervert.
You want her?

639
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,518
- This child?
- I don't even want
to talk about her.

640
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:35,146
- But you are.
- Only because
you're making me.

641
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:38,733
( chuckles )
I didn't force you
to open your mouth

642
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,526
and make words come out.

643
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:44,155
This is cruel and unfair.
Cruelly unfair.

644
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,823
"Oh, the cruelty.

645
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,326
Shae is so cruel to me."

646
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,204
Hmm, yes.

647
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,924
Now do you think
I'm cruel?

648
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,260
Only if you stop.

649
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,098
But you mustn't
come here again.

650
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:16,479
Do you hear me?

651
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,524
You've come to
a dangerous place

652
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,902
full of dangerous people.

653
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,865
Dangerous people.
( moans )

654
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,502
-<i> ( knocks )</i>
<i>- Guard: Lady Tyrell,</i>
<i>my king.</i>

655
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,420
Send her in.

656
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,270
You wanted to see me,
Your Grace?

657
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,980
I'm leaving
on a hunting trip.

658
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,441
I just wanted
to make sure

659
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,318
you had everything
you need before I left.

660
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,445
That's very thoughtful,
Your Grace.

661
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,280
I have everything
I could want.

662
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,657
Good. Good.

663
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,326
How are you finding life
in the capital?

664
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:15,121
It must be quite a change
after Renly's camp.

665
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,747
A welcome one.

666
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:21,377
A military encampment
is no place for a lady.

667
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,629
And the bedside
of a traitor?

668
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,717
Is that a place
for a lady?

669
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,638
Your Grace,

670
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,808
I tried to do my duty
as a wife, that is all.

671
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:39,228
What was your duty
to this traitor
as you saw it?

672
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,480
The duty of any wife
to any husband--

673
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,190
to provide him
with children.

674
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,526
<i>You failed to do this.</i>

675
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,571
- Why?
-<i> I--</i>

676
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,325
I would not speak ill
of the dead, Your Grace.

677
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,494
You think one ought
to speak kindly

678
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:58,581
of a traitor merely
because he's had a sword
put through his heart?

679
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,207
No.

680
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,252
I do beg your pardon.

681
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:06,589
The subtleties of politics
are often lost on me.

682
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,966
Renly...

683
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,345
I don't believe
he was interested

684
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,890
<i>in the company</i>
<i>of women.</i>

685
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,268
What makes you say this?

686
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:24,523
Whenever I wanted
to make a child with him,

687
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,193
he--

688
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,236
he had so many
excuses,

689
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,238
so many late-night
war councils.

690
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,657
He never wanted
to try.

691
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,828
Except one evening,

692
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,706
after he'd had
far too much wine
to drink,

693
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,250
he suggested something--

694
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,257
something that sounded
very painful

695
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,259
and couldn't possibly
result in children.

696
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,222
Maybe the fault
was with me.

697
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,391
No, he was a known...

698
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:02,061
degenerate.

699
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,438
It's such a relief
to hear you say so,
Your Grace.

700
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:06,190
Mmm.

701
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,901
I've considered
making his perversion

702
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,903
punishable by death.

703
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:15,115
As is your right.

704
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,619
You must do whatever
you need to do.

705
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,083
You are the king.

706
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,210
Yes.

707
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,756
I am.

708
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,264
Do you like it?

709
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,099
I just had it made.

710
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:43,060
Probably one
of the finest weapons
in the Seven Kingdoms.

711
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,270
It's beautiful.

712
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,772
Will you show me
how it works?

713
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,486
It's a new design.

714
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:54,780
Much easier to load.
There's no crank.

715
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:58,826
You use this lever
to draw the string.

716
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,667
The bolt goes here.

717
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:12,464
And then you just aim...

718
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,760
and...

719
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:20,514
( laughs )

720
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:24,226
Would you take me
hunting sometime?

721
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,353
Forgive me, Your Grace.

722
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,397
I know a hunt
is no place for a woman.

723
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,065
It's not unheard of.

724
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,276
My father would never
let me before--

725
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,778
You no longer
belong to him.

726
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,823
Do you want
to hold it?

727
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,867
May I?
Please.

728
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,877
I imagine it must be
so exciting

729
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,879
to squeeze
your finger here

730
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,506
and watch something
die over there.

731
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,180
Could you do it?

732
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,182
Could you...

733
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:05,517
kill something?

734
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,229
I don't know, Your Grace.
Do you think I could?

735
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,565
Yes.

736
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:14,068
Would you like
to watch me?

737
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,990
Yes.

738
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,244
( screams )
Stop! Stop!

739
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,580
-<i> Tell us the truth.</i>
<i>- About what?</i>

740
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,376
( screams )
I don't know
what you want.

741
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,920
I want the truth.

742
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,672
What truth?

743
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,590
Why'd you take
Winterfell?

744
00:44:36,673 --> 00:44:39,093
I took it to--
I took it--

745
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,427
- Who gave the orders?
- No one.

746
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,096
- I took it on my own.
-<i> Why?</i>

747
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,056
To take the North
while it was vulnerable.

748
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,974
What were you going
to do once you took it?

749
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,434
Hold it.
Rule it.

750
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:51,397
Good.
That's very good.

751
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,318
( screams )

752
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,070
Why did you do that?
I told you.

753
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,613
Why did you take
Winterfell?

754
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:03,033
I took it to bring glory
to my house and my father.

755
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,835
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

756
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:16,422
I took it because
I hated the Starks.

757
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,757
I hated them
for holding me prisoner.

758
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,135
I wanted to hurt them.

759
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,101
What are you doing?

760
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,314
Please.

761
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,693
( screaming )

762
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:42,072
I'll tell you anything.

763
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,241
Just take it off.

764
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:47,369
<i>Please.</i>
<i>Please, just take it off.</i>

765
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:50,164
<i>( door closes )</i>

766
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:59,590
- Your sister sent me.
- Yara?

767
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,928
( whimpers )

768
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,475
I'll come for you tonight
when the castle sleeps.

769
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,351
No, don't go.
Please, please.

770
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,145
No, please
don't leave me.

771
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,771
Please, please.

772
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,440
Please,
please don't go!

773
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:21,195
( sobbing )
Please. Please.
Don't leave me.

774
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,572
Please don't go.

775
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,662
Rickon,
stay with us.

776
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:35,209
It's all right.
The wolves will protect him.

777
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,637
You can get
inside his head,

778
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,430
see through his eyes.

779
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,182
Only when I'm asleep.

780
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:52,851
That's how it begins
until you learn
to control it.

781
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,144
You're a warg.

782
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,855
It's not just wolves.

783
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,357
Sometimes in my dreams
there's a--

784
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,652
- A three-eyed raven?
-<i> You've seen it?</i>

785
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,695
We saw him together.
You haven't forgotten?

786
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,532
Does it have anything
to do with warging?

787
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,117
No, the raven
is something different,

788
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,620
something deeper.

789
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,038
The raven brings
the sight.

790
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:16,208
Seeing things
that haven't happened yet?

791
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,335
<i>Or things that happened</i>
<i>long before you were born</i>

792
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:22,047
or things that are
happening right now
thousands of miles away.

793
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,258
What's he telling him?

794
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,468
Why don't you ask?

795
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,055
Isn't he ashamed,
your brother,

796
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,807
needing you
to protect him?

797
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,643
Where's the shame in that?

798
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:38,230
Any boy his age who needs
his sister to protect him

799
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:42,109
is gonna find himself
needing lots of protecting.

800
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:46,488
Some people
will always need help.

801
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,865
<i>That doesn't mean</i>
<i>they're not worth helping.</i>

802
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,456
When my father died,
I dreamt it.

803
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,835
You didn't dream it.
You saw it.

804
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:02,045
So did I.

805
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,505
You have the sight, too?

806
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:10,679
When I told my father
about your father...

807
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:15,267
for the first time
in my life, I saw him cry.

808
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,227
Your father
is Howland Reed?

809
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,729
Yeah.

810
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:22,107
He saved my father's life
during the rebellion.

811
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,026
Your father told you
about the rebellion?

812
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,028
Mine never did.

813
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,821
But I saw that, too.

814
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:31,116
What else have you seen?

815
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,243
Only one thing
that matters--

816
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,245
you.

817
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,048
<i>( men laughing )</i>

818
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,883
Thoros:
<i>I never liked</i>
<i>the skinny ones.</i>

819
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,760
<i>Like drinking</i>
<i>from a puddle.</i>

820
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,720
Not that I'm averse
to drinking from a puddle

821
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,347
every now and again,
you understand.

822
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,973
I don't drink ale.

823
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,768
There's no story so good
a drink won't make it better.

824
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,561
- Yeah!
- You see?

825
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,813
They've all suffered through
my bouts of sobriety.

826
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,274
It's very tedious
for all concerned.

827
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,693
Now, how did
three children--

828
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,278
We're not children.

829
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:11,114
How did three young persons
such as yourselves,

830
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,659
untrained
in the art of war,

831
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,202
escape from Harrenhal?

832
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,539
Gendry's a smith.

833
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,166
He was apprenticed
in the armory.

834
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:24,586
A smith, eh?
Where'd you train?

835
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,300
King's Landing.
Tobho Mott's shop.

836
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,761
That criminal.
He charges twice as much

837
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,346
as every other armorer
in the city.

838
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,056
That's because
he's twice as good.

839
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:39,309
Aha! A smith
and a salesman.

840
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,687
Gendry stole us weapons.

841
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,564
Ah, fought your way
out of Harrenhal, I see.

842
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,984
He knows how
to use a sword
and so do I.

843
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,569
( men laugh )

844
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,655
My brothers taught me.

845
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,281
( men laugh )

846
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:58,203
Men:
Ooh!

847
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,503
( men cheer )

848
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:15,971
- To your brothers!
- ( cheering )

849
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,771
You can finish
your meals before you go.

850
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,399
It may be awhile
before you see another.

851
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:30,485
- You'll free us?
- I gave you my word.

852
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,948
But before you go,

853
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:38,118
allow me to raise
a cup to your--

854
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,746
- Hey, hey.
- ( men cheering )

855
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:43,707
Now that is an uncommonly
large person.

856
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,125
How does one
manage to subdue

857
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,835
such an uncommonly
large person?

858
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:49,671
One waits for him to drink
until he passes out.

859
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,591
Poor man.
You have my sympathy.

860
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:57,721
Aha, not a man at all.

861
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,892
- A Hound!
- ( men howl and bark )

862
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,603
So good to see
you again, Clegane.

863
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,563
Thoros?

864
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:09,065
The fuck you doing here?

865
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,776
Drinking and talking
too much.

866
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,986
- Same as ever.
- ( men laugh )

867
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:16,656
- A pretty prize, lads.
- Men: Yeah!

868
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,243
Girl.

869
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,663
What in seven hells

870
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,291
are you doing
with the Stark bitch?

871
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,596
Jaime:
It's a tough decision--

872
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:41,681
take the bridge
and risk being seen

873
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,600
or cross the great water.

874
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:46,144
- Silence, Kingslayer.
- Anyone can see us
on the bridge,

875
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:49,314
but cross by water
and the current could take us

876
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:51,191
or I could escape
down the river.

877
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,193
Good luck.

878
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:59,032
It's wonderful to watch you
wrestle with these dilemmas.

879
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:01,493
Which will she choose?

880
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,166
Gambler at heart.

881
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,793
Wouldn't have guessed.

882
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,878
Be quick about it.

883
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,510
( Jaime groans )

884
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,345
- I need to rest.
- Get up.

885
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:22,848
I have these,
you know, on your feet
when you walk too far.

886
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,349
- What do you call them?
- Get up now.

887
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:27,394
Corns.
I never used
to get corns.

888
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,937
<i>Of course I used</i>
<i>to ride everywhere,</i>

889
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,565
not march around
like a common foot soldier

890
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,984
wearing the same shit boots
for over a year.

891
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:36,152
This heel is ruined.
There's no way--

892
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,780
( grunts )

893
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,536
( chuckles )

894
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:48,081
I never understood why
some knights felt the need
to carry two swords.

895
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,168
( sighs )

896
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,056
Ooh.

897
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,812
You move well...

898
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,984
for a great beast
of a woman.

899
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,073
You shouldn't grimace
before you lunge.

900
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,367
It gives away the game.

901
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,175
<i>Bit of a quandary</i>
<i>for you.</i>

902
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:43,094
If you kill me,
you fail Lady Stark.

903
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,889
<i>But if you don't kill me,</i>

904
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,099
I'm going to kill you.

905
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,857
You're good.

906
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,943
Graceless, but good.

907
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,454
See? If you were
willing to hurt me,

908
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,164
you might have
had me there.

909
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,627
( grunting )

910
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,214
( grunts )

911
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:22,342
( panting )

912
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:30,141
( groans, coughs )

913
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:43,822
<i>( Jaime breathing heavily )</i>

914
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:46,116
<i>( horse neighs )</i>

915
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:57,127
Looks like your woman's
getting the better of you,

916
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,254
if you can
call that a woman.

917
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:01,464
We enjoy a good fight.

918
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,842
Gets our juices flowing.

919
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:06,720
The Flayed Man
of House Bolton.

920
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,513
A bit gruesome
for my taste.

921
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:12,225
- You sure he's the one?
- That's him, all right.

922
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:14,310
I saw him fight
at the tourney

923
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,187
for Ser Willem Frey's
wedding.

924
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,025
Give the man his silver.

925
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:24,320
Let us go
and my father will pay
you whatever you want.

926
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,573
Enough to buy me
a new head?

927
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:29,951
<i>If the King in the North</i>
<i>hears I had the Kingslayer</i>

928
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,871
and let him go,
he'll be taking it right off.

929
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,956
I'd rather he takes yours.

930
00:55:46,051 --> 00:57:04,295
<i>( music playing )</i>
