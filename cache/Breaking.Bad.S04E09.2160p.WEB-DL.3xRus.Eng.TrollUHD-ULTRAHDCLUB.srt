1
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,369
I got it, I got it.

2
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,706
{\an8}You're like a bee at a damn picnic,
Marie.

3
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,209
{\an8}- Morning.
- Hey, buddy.

4
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,171
{\an8}- Ready to get your rocks on?
- See? I knew it.

5
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:31,049
{\an8}"Mineral show" is just some sort of
guy code for "strip club."

6
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,635
{\an8}Yeah. You got your singles?

7
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,305
{\an8}- Got it?
- Yeah.

8
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,685
{\an8}Don't let him get too crazy, okay?

9
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:45,522
{\an8}Cram one more giant geode in here,
we'll be sleeping in the garage.

10
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,025
{\an8}- Got it. I got it.
- I'm sorry.

11
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:57,117
Christ. Longest week ever.

12
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,913
Here's just hoping we get something good.

13
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:03,499
Keep your fingers crossed.

14
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,839
Relax, buddy, this ain't no spy movie.

15
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,842
It's more like <i>Rocky, </i>you know?

16
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,147
{\an8}Get the bad guy.

17
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,193
{\an8}Yeah!

18
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,829
{\an8}- But... What are you doing, buddy?
- Leaving.

19
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:27,749
{\an8}You gotta go inside, order something
like last time. Avoid suspicion.

20
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,294
Besides, I want a vanilla shake.

21
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,630
{\an8}We'll use the drive-through.

22
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,473
{\an8}All right, baby, let's see what we got.

23
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,077
What the hell? Look at this.

24
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,625
That's work. That's home.
That's work, that's home.

25
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,044
What, this guy

26
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,463
he goes two places every day, all week?

27
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,923
{\an8}It's unbelievable.

28
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,552
{\an8}Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.

29
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:26,933
{\an8}Hank, is it possible that maybe,
just maybe

30
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,728
{\an8}he's not your guy?

31
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,023
{\an8}A guy this clean has got to be dirty.

32
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,277
{\an8}What's the play here, buddy?

33
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,072
How do I get this guy?

34
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,366
Yeah.

35
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,201
How?

36
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,929
{\an8}Yes, hi.

37
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:51,017
I live on the 4900 block
of Doswell Place and I want to report

38
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:54,312
a very suspicious man
lurking in my neighborhood.

39
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,230
He's sitting in a blue sedan,

40
00:05:56,398 --> 00:06:00,736
and he's been staring at
a particular house for a very long time.

41
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,529
Thank you. Thank you so much.

42
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,657
If you would, I would appreciate it.

43
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,066
All right.

44
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,819
I guess we'd better get started.

45
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,946
I already did.

46
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,784
Yeah?

47
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,332
Hey.

48
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,253
Got one of those for me?

49
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,173
- One of those what?
- Cigarette.

50
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:10,263
Look, it's still in there, all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.

51
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,812
Just give me one.

52
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,880
So, what have you been up to?

53
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,674
What?

54
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:50,929
You know, just a day in the life.
What do you do after work?

55
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,517
Go home. Watch TV.

56
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,227
What do you watch?

57
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,937
I don't know, stuff.

58
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,273
Well, like what?

59
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:07,779
Like <i>Ice Road Truckers.</i>

60
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,365
<i>Ice Road Truckers.</i>

61
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,117
What happens on that one?

62
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,453
Guys drive on ice.

63
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,879
I am gonna do it.

64
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,888
You gotta inhale, by the way.

65
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:39,394
What the hell, man? Don't you have
enough cancer already? Look.

66
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,147
I said

67
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:46,359
I'd do it. I'll do it.

68
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,404
Yeah, well

69
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,531
what does it matter?

70
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,200
We're both dead men anyway.

71
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,154
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Hi.

72
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,698
Am I catching you at a bad time?

73
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,326
No. I have a few minutes.

74
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,828
So Mr.
I'm-Almost-Sixteen-Leave-Me-Alone

75
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,832
doesn't want a big birthday,
just wants to hang out with friends

76
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,919
- which is fine by me. You?
- Fine by me.

77
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:51,591
<i>Okay. So I figured a low-key family
dinner, no official party,</i>

78
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,760
<i>and we bite the bullet,</i>

79
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,596
and buy him a car.

80
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,016
Used, I was thinking, would be best.

81
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:05,313
But no more than five years old.
Airbags, safety-rated, all that.

82
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,858
Do you have any thoughts on what kind?

83
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,778
Or should I just go ahead and...

84
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,781
Yeah. You just go ahead.

85
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,658
<i>Okay.</i>

86
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:22,747
<i>Listen, on another subject,
I just wanted to tell you</i>

87
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,958
that business is good.

88
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,293
Really good.

89
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:31,715
So good that I'm thinking, maybe

90
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,092
you don't need to even work

91
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,594
your second job.

92
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,520
- You're turning a profit?
<i>- We're coming close.</i>

93
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:51,276
Give us another month or two and,
yeah, we'll be there.

94
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,320
All of this to say

95
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,700
maybe you could start thinking
about an exit strategy.

96
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,747
I'm working on it.

97
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,876
Okay.

98
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:40,866
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, buddy. Wake you?</i>

99
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:44,661
No, Hank. I'm up.

100
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:47,581
Good. What you doing?

101
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,249
<i>I'm...</i>

102
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,377
Hey, listen, I'll cut to it.
Another favor to ask.

103
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,714
<i>I'm thinking about Gus Fring.
How he never goes anywhere.</i>

104
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,966
<i>One restaurant, home, back and forth?</i>

105
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:00,260
<i>I'm even more convinced it's bullshit</i>

106
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:02,888
<i>because he owns
13 other restaurants. Right?</i>

107
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,183
So I start thinking
about this little empire of his.

108
00:12:06,349 --> 00:12:10,228
Fourteen restaurants. Who supplies
them? What's the base of operations?

109
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:12,606
So I do a little digging, and bingo.

110
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,484
Pollos Hermanos
has a main distribution center.

111
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,235
<i>It's not far from town.</i>

112
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:18,945
The place is huge. I mean

113
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:22,783
I'm looking at it online now.
It's a big warehouse,

114
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:26,703
and rows
of these long, poultry buildings,

115
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,081
or hatcheries, whatever you call them.

116
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:33,794
<i>Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
Sounds promising, right?</i>

117
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:40,258
<i>So, what do you say, buddy?
Got another field trip in you?</i>

118
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:46,181
You know, Hank, I'm... I'm... I'm...

119
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:50,268
I mean, it sounds great, it really does.
But I'm...

120
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:53,188
You know, I won't lie.

121
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,566
You've caught me somewhat

122
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,319
indisposed.

123
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:02,572
What do you mean,
like taking-a-dump indisposed?

124
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:07,285
Yeah. That's embarrassing.

125
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:08,787
That's it.

126
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:14,042
You know, it's just upset stomach and,
you know, everything...

127
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,212
- Yeah.
<i>- It's out of control.</i>

128
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:21,383
And it's really explosive.
Bad Tex-Mex

129
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,261
- at the mall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.

130
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:26,304
You don't have to paint a picture.

131
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:28,849
One guy in a diaper is enough
for this trip.

132
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:31,560
<i>- Yeah, and I'm sorry, Hank.</i>
- Hey, don't be.

133
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:36,273
I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it. I'll find another ride.

134
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,945
- Another ride?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

135
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,865
I'm sure I can get someone else
to take me.

136
00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:47,242
My trainer, Chuck.
Maybe I'll ask him.

137
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:51,621
<i>Well, look, I'm...
This is probably just a 24-hour thing.</i>

138
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,874
Maybe 48 hours at the most.

139
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,838
And do you think you can possibly
hold off for a day or two?

140
00:14:00,046 --> 00:14:03,508
Jeez, buddy, I mean, I...

141
00:14:03,674 --> 00:14:06,720
<i>You know, I just... I would just really</i>

142
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:10,265
love to be the one
to be able to take you there.

143
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:14,144
And, I mean, I've just really

144
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,981
enjoyed, you know, the time with you,

145
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,193
- and helping you and...
<i>- Well, yeah.</i>

146
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:24,529
Okay, sure.
If it means that much to you.

147
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:28,200
Just, you know, give me a call
when you're feeling up to it.

148
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:31,661
Thank you. I will. Okay.

149
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:33,330
Bye.

150
00:14:54,142 --> 00:14:57,979
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Mike, listen.

151
00:14:58,146 --> 00:15:01,274
I just want to say first off,
don't be angry.

152
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:02,692
<i>What is it, Walter?</i>

153
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:06,571
My brother-in-law, my DE... He...

154
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:11,284
Soon, he will probably,
in the near future

155
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:14,621
take a ride out
to a certain distribution center

156
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:19,000
to look around for things.

157
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,669
Just

158
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:25,423
look around for things. And, yeah.

159
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:32,597
Mike?

160
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:53,868
- Where's this all going?
- Elsewhere.

161
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:08,383
Thank you. Please give this
to your car-care professional.

162
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:22,063
So a hand wax for you today?

163
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,898
Okay, great.

164
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,030
Please give this
to your car-care professional.

165
00:16:31,114 --> 00:16:34,492
And the black Explorer,
we could shampoo your floor mats,

166
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:37,495
but deluxe detailing
is the best for your buck.

167
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:40,415
And SUV's are extra.

168
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:43,960
And please give this
to your car-care professional.

169
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,295
Thank you.

170
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:49,299
Please give this
to your car-care professional.

171
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,804
Hey, Sky.

172
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:58,058
Oh, my God. Ted.

173
00:16:58,266 --> 00:16:59,517
What are you...?

174
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:01,311
Someone from the office

175
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:05,482
said you worked down here.
So I thought I'd come down and say hi.

176
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:06,733
Well

177
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,027
hello.

178
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:10,737
You look great.

179
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:14,991
No. No, I don't.
I probably just look crazed.

180
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,369
Not at all. You look happy.

181
00:17:17,535 --> 00:17:20,038
Last time I saw you...

182
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,336
Hi, there.

183
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,380
I guess, Skyler

184
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:32,801
I'm gonna need to talk to you.

185
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,643
Ted, I really don't think
we have anything to talk about.

186
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,145
Actually, we do.

187
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,651
An audit?
Wait, an audit tomorrow?

188
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:54,280
- How long have you had this?
- A while.

189
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:57,784
I debated, you know, contacting you.

190
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,453
Contact me?
What about a lawyer, Ted?

191
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,539
Ted, this is...

192
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:04,666
This is the CID.

193
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:07,544
The criminal division.

194
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,798
My God,
you're facing a felony charge here.

195
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,552
A $100,000 fine
on top of the taxes you already owe

196
00:18:15,718 --> 00:18:18,430
- plus five years in prison.
- Yeah.

197
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:19,973
- It's bad.
- Yeah.

198
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,435
It most certainly is.

199
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:28,690
Look, here's the thing.
I was wondering, maybe

200
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:31,276
if you could help with this.

201
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,111
Help?

202
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,238
Help how?

203
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,825
Well, with your knowledge
of how the books

204
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:42,662
got the way they are,
maybe there's some way

205
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:45,373
you could undo what's in there.

206
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,334
You want me to uncook your books?

207
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:53,089
Maybe there's some method or some
accounting trick you could use...

208
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:56,176
Ted, it doesn't work like that.

209
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:58,428
The damage is already...

210
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:04,142
My name.

211
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:06,769
My signatures

212
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:09,522
are all over those books.

213
00:19:10,064 --> 00:19:12,358
Skyler, I'm accountable, not you.

214
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:15,236
Let me explain
what's going to happen here, okay?

215
00:19:15,403 --> 00:19:18,406
Once the CID
sees this is willful tax fraud

216
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:21,784
they will build the strongest
possible case against you.

217
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:26,456
Once they start down that path, they
have an 80 percent conviction rate.

218
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,542
That's because they're allowed
to monitor your mail,

219
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:33,880
and tap your phones,
and not just you, Ted

220
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:37,300
everyone involved in those books.

221
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,181
I can't have this in my life.

222
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,892
I cannot be audited.

223
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,646
Skyler, you're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.

224
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:53,149
It's the captain they want,
not some cashier at a car wash.

225
00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:57,695
No offense.

226
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:00,949
I'm sorry. I...

227
00:20:01,115 --> 00:20:04,452
Look, I don't want you to worry, okay?

228
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:10,124
I'm going to figure out
a way through this, somehow. Okay?

229
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:21,135
Here.

230
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,864
So is he gonna kill him?

231
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,453
Is who gonna kill who?

232
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,499
Gus.

233
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,752
Is he gonna kill Mr. White's
brother-in-law?

234
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:01,509
I mean, he's the reason
for all of this here, right?

235
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:08,766
Because it's totally logical for him
to off the dude.

236
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:15,440
A-hole DEA agent poking around your junk.

237
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,611
Who needs that, right?

238
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:25,658
Makes sense to get rid of him for good.

239
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:34,834
But killing a cop

240
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:36,919
I don't know.

241
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,757
It could look suspicious

242
00:21:40,923 --> 00:21:45,595
if the dude who's investigating you
suddenly up and dies.

243
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:53,853
Then there's... There's Mr. White

244
00:21:55,396 --> 00:22:02,070
who would be even more apeshit
if he had family getting murdered.

245
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:08,951
He'd never cook for Gus again.

246
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:19,128
Guess there's a lot of angles
to consider.

247
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:27,720
If something were to happen to him,
would you have a problem with that?

248
00:22:32,892 --> 00:22:35,228
Who really cares what I think?

249
00:23:29,949 --> 00:23:31,909
Son of a bitch.

250
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,331
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.

251
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,180
Hey.

252
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:53,431
Get down!

253
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,748
- Should I even ask?
- I wouldn't.

254
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:51,758
So, what? Is this going to be
a regular thing now?

255
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,470
Meth cooking and corpse disposal?
Jesus.

256
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,348
Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.

257
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,060
What was it this time?

258
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,147
What did this poor bastard do
to piss off Gus?

259
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,482
Or did Gus need to send another message?

260
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:08,942
Shut your mouth.

261
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,987
You shut your mouth
or I'll shut it for you.

262
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:16,450
I don't want you talking to me
or Jesse. Just get the barrel.

263
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:21,412
And if you ever plan on calling
the cops on one of my guys again

264
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,751
you go ahead and get two barrels.

265
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,540
Like

266
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:10,087
I guess I never thanked you for
what you did.

267
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,215
Thanks.

268
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,972
Next time don't stand there
like an idiot.

269
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,266
Move your feet.
Running and so forth.

270
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,978
But seriously, what...?

271
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,855
- What was the deal with Gus?
- The deal?

272
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:33,151
That Terminator shit.
Walking right into the bullets.

273
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,404
What the hell was he doing?

274
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,073
The cartel needs Gus.

275
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,492
His distribution network.
They're not looking to kill him.

276
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,788
But, what? The rest of us are like
open season?

277
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:48,375
Is he doing anything about that,
or do we keep hanging out,

278
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,044
- for target practice while he...?
- Kid.

279
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:56,299
Enough. You got questions,
ask him yourself.

280
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,187
And here again.

281
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,024
Unreported income.

282
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,610
That's more than a year straight so far.

283
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:21,491
You want to say something about this?
I'm having a hard time figuring it out.

284
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,744
I'd have to

285
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:28,749
have a look at the copies of
the receipts to refresh my memory.

286
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:32,836
Take all the time you need,
Mr. Beneke. That's why we're here.

287
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,594
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.

288
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,804
I got lost. Hey, Ted.

289
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:47,225
- Sky.
- This building is so confusing.

290
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,394
There are doors everywhere.

291
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,773
- Hi. You are...?
- Special Agent James Bekaris.

292
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,150
"Special." Skyler White.

293
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,571
Ms. White,
you are the accountant of record,

294
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,282
for many of these reports,
is that correct?

295
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,826
- Guilty as charged.
- Can you shed light

296
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,204
on this history of missing revenue?

297
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,748
Missing? No, it's there.

298
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:13,126
No. Revenue most definitely
flowed through this company,

299
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,421
but it's not all accounted for
in your reports.

300
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:23,637
Let's take a look.

301
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,807
Oh, well, you know

302
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,268
this account here,
that is Mr. Keller's account.

303
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,105
And Mr. Keller is an old friend
of Ted's dad.

304
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,649
He always sends an electronic payment

305
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,568
which I hate,
because I'm a real-paper person.

306
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,446
Mr. Keller is
one of those environmental people.

307
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,824
Since there wasn't a physical check

308
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,828
I didn't enter it into the book.
But the money is there.

309
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:53,125
Ms. White, you've read Section 61
of the IRC?

310
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,253
I did not follow what you just said.

311
00:29:56,962 --> 00:30:01,258
How gross income for a business is
defined, you're not allowed to do that.

312
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,718
- Well, I think I am.
- No, you're not.

313
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:08,140
Well, you know what they say about
opinions, right? Everyone's got one.

314
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,017
But seriously, I am.

315
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:14,855
It doesn't matter if it's an
electronic check or a paper check

316
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:18,191
income is income.
You're not allowed to not declare it.

317
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:21,194
When I input everything into the Quicken

318
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:25,532
nothing flashed red,
so that's gotta mean it's okay, right?

319
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,160
Quicken.

320
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,206
You used Quicken to manage books
for a business this size.

321
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,626
I did. Do you guys use that here?
Because it is the best.

322
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:40,380
It's like having a calculator
on your computer. Amazing.

323
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,466
- Ms. White, how did you get this job?
- Ted hired me.

324
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,927
No, I mean your qualifications.

325
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,556
What are your qualifications?
Where did you get your training?

326
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,767
Well, I haven't had any training, per se.

327
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,395
I've always been naturally good
with numbers.

328
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:59,024
Got a good instinct for them.
Right, Teddy?

329
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:03,862
Right.

330
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:08,575
This is all falling into place now.

331
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,916
Ms. White, I just have to ask.
You're not managing accounts

332
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:20,045
- anywhere else, are you?
- Right now? No.

333
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,505
I'm a cashier at a car wash.

334
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,886
I'm not really clear about what
happened in there.

335
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:31,348
What happened was good news.
Ignorance of the law

336
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:35,268
doesn't equate to criminality.
It equates to ignorance.

337
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,729
Pay your back taxes, pay the penalties,

338
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,565
and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.

339
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,442
Pay with what?

340
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,111
I owe them $617,000. What am I...?

341
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,324
Look, just figure it out, all right?
And you've just dodged prison.

342
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:53,536
Sell your assets. Get rid of the BMW,
take out a second mortgage...

343
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,039
Second mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.

344
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:59,376
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets left to sell.

345
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:03,171
Ted, if you don't pay them,
they will reopen the investigation,

346
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,842
and that little fiction I just spun up
there is gonna completely unravel.

347
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,844
You have to settle.

348
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,892
Wish I could.

349
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,315
Come in.

350
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,291
I hope you brought an appetite.

351
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,879
Yeah, I guess.

352
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,260
Mike mentioned you have some questions.

353
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,265
Yeah.

354
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,145
We'll eat first, and then we'll talk.

355
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,278
Right on.

356
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,542
What am I doing here?

357
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,889
I know you have concerns.

358
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,685
What happened yesterday,
to my man at the farm

359
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,813
it was a terrible thing.

360
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:28,233
The dude getting his head
blown off? Yeah.

361
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,112
I've invited you into my home

362
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:37,492
prepared food so we could sit and talk.

363
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,705
Discuss what's going on in this business

364
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,959
our business, like men.

365
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,963
And I will explain everything
that is happening.

366
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,340
I will answer your questions.

367
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,093
But first

368
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:59,681
I need you to answer one question for me.

369
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,394
Can you cook Walter's formula?

370
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,605
What?

371
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,525
Walter's formula.

372
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:15,029
Can you produce his product
without any help? Alone.

373
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:17,532
No.

374
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:21,953
Why?

375
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:25,915
You're asking me if I can cook
Mr. White's crystal?

376
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,668
Without him?

377
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:30,503
Me?

378
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,965
The junkie loser you were about to waste,

379
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,468
and dump in the desert a month ago.

380
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,636
This your plan?

381
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,724
Invite me in your house,
make whatever this is

382
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,603
be my buddy,

383
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,023
and make me feel important.

384
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:57,489
Then get me to keep cooking for you
after you kill Mr. White?

385
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,160
You wanna... You wanna talk like men?

386
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:08,208
Let's talk like men. You kill Mr. White,
you're gonna have to kill me too.

387
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,085
That is not what I asked you.

388
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:16,674
You are here because circumstances
with the cartel are untenable.

389
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,302
And I need your help.

390
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,348
I need you to help prevent
an all-out war.

391
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,392
Now, if you would

392
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,854
answer the question.

393
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,378
Hey, you headed out?

394
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:38,757
Yeah.

395
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:28,098
<i>Yo, Mr. White, hey. I really gotta
talk to you. I don't know if you're</i>

396
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:32,018
<i>with your family or whatever,
but this is important,</i>

397
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:35,856
<i>so I'm hoping you could come over.</i>

398
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,991
Thank God. Come on in.

399
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:52,998
- You... You want a beer or something?
- No.

400
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:57,127
- Should I sit down?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, go ahead.

401
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,046
Okay, so...

402
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,718
Okay, so word has come down that they...

403
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:07,804
They want me to go to Mexico.

404
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:12,058
There's some...
Some sort of war brewing

405
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:15,896
- between Gus and the cartel.
- "Word has come down"?

406
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,775
The cartel has been... Has been
messing with Gus' operation.

407
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,652
Like jacking trucks to,
like, send a message.

408
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,822
And yesterday,
that dude we brought to the lab.

409
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:30,577
I mean, they shot him right in
front of me. Just blew his head open.

410
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:34,372
Some sniper nailed him from
like a mile away.

411
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,835
Anyway, they've been holding them off.

412
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:41,463
But between the cartel taking potshots,

413
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,509
and your brother-in-law trying
to throw a net over the whole deal

414
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:49,513
it's like what you call
a rock-and-a-hard-place situation.

415
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,308
So, Gus is... Is gonna cave.

416
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,021
So the cartel wants half
of Gus' entire operation,

417
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:01,775
and they want your formula.
And he's gonna give it to them.

418
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:07,030
Well, I... I gotta give it to them.
I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico,

419
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:11,910
and teach a bunch of cartel chemists
how to cook a batch of blue.

420
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:15,163
You know, and Gus doesn't trust you,

421
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:18,250
so I gotta go.
I mean, you're the chemist, man

422
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:22,003
you know, not me.
I mean, let's say I go down to...

423
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:26,258
You know, go over there.
Go to the jungle or whatever,

424
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,927
and they got like actual chemists

425
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:32,180
like cartel chemists asking me
chemistry stuff

426
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,433
that I don't know how to
answer because I'm not you.

427
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,938
And what if all the equipment
is in Mexican instead of English?

428
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:44,401
You know?
I don't know. I don't know.

429
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:47,028
I mean, if I mess this up

430
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:51,867
I'm dead, you know? All of us.

431
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:58,540
Mr. White, look, I need...
I need your help.

432
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:02,836
Okay, maybe you could...
Maybe you could coach me,

433
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:07,841
or something, you know.
Or give me some notes.

434
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,093
Mr. White?

435
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,013
So you saw Gus?

436
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,891
What? No.

437
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:19,144
- You didn't see Gus.
- No.

438
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,939
Then who told you all of that?

439
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,276
It was passed down, like I said.

440
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,155
"Passed down." By whom?

441
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:32,949
By... By Mike and them.

442
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:37,495
- I mean, they did. They...
- So "they" doesn't include Gus.

443
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:39,372
You haven't been with Gus.

444
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:42,584
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.

445
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:46,087
- Why are you...?
- You weren't at Gus' house last night.

446
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,422
What?

447
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,427
What the hell? Jesus.

448
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,722
Still here.

449
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,893
- It's still here.
- Jesus.

450
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:07,317
You look me in the eye and you tell me

451
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:10,570
that you weren't at his house last night.

452
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,614
I...

453
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:17,494
Look, I didn't have a chance, all right?

454
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,538
Okay? I knew you would react
this way.

455
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,917
I knew you would freak out
and wouldn't believe me.

456
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,544
That's why I didn't say anything.

457
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:30,131
Look, there was just this one
big pot of stew.

458
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:33,218
He just made this one big pot
and we both ate from it.

459
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:35,929
What was I supposed to do, poison myself?

460
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:40,350
Two hours, 18 minutes, you couldn't
figure out a way to give it to him?

461
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:43,478
- He never left the room.
- You lying little shit!

462
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:46,231
You had one thing to do, one thing.

463
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:49,985
That is the only thing, I might add,
that would save our lives,

464
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:53,154
and you were right there.
You were in his house,

465
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,157
and you didn't have the guts to do it.

466
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:02,539
Two hours and 18 minutes?

467
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:05,917
You never had any intention
of killing him, did you?

468
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:09,212
How did you know
I was at his house last night?

469
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,047
Were you following me?

470
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:17,971
This. This is how I knew.

471
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:26,229
- You bugged my car?
- 7:10 to 9:28 p.m.

472
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:30,400
Two hours and 18 minutes.
But you had no intentions, did you?

473
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,111
Not the slightest intention.

474
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:36,197
Everything that I have done for you.

475
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,950
You put a bug on my car?

476
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,745
I'm sorry,
after everything you've done for me?

477
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,955
What you've done for me?

478
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,374
You killed me, is what you've done!

479
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:51,171
You've signed my death warrant! Now
you want advice? I'll give you advice:

480
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,923
Go to Mexico and screw up
like I know you will.

481
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,426
Wind up in a barrel somewhere!

482
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:23,828
You son of a...

483
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,166
Can you walk?

484
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,170
Yeah.

485
00:45:55,879 --> 00:45:59,007
Then get the fuck out of here
and never come back.
