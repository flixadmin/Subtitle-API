1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,645
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,120
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,802
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,963
<i>But my old approach wasn't enough.</i>

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,480
<i>I had to become someone else.</i>

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,041
<i>I had to become something else.</i>

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,445
<i>I had to become the Green Arrow.</i>

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,965
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,446
You won't be able to stop him.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,965
<i>We need to trap him.</i>

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,322
Dad?

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,085
<i>"NOAH". We are the same, you and I.</i>

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,408
You were wrong. lam nothing like you.

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,609
<i>"JOHN". I had to put him down, Lyla.</i>

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,649
He had reached for my gun.

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,164
- Alex. Where are we?
- Thea...

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,925
- No, I can't...
- Where are you going?

18
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,130
Rubicon. Designed to prevent any country,
even our own,

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,481
from firing a nuclear missile.

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,647
<i>"LYLA". Darhk ripped it out.</i>

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,922
<i>Darhk would control
the world's nuclear stockpile.</i>

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,849
Andy told me that "Genesis" was coming.

23
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,287
<i>God wanted to give the world
a do-over so he destroyed it.</i>

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,447
<i>He destroyed it with a flood.</i>

25
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,847
<i>So, nuclear annihilation
is Darhk's flood,</i>

26
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,646
<i>what's he planning on building as his ark?</i>

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,203
Russia, Markovia, Corto Maltese,
us, every NATO ally.

28
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,006
Rubicon has control
over all their nuclear systems.

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,531
You mean HIVE does.

30
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,882
I know it's a little late for this,
but whoever created an algorithm

31
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,210
that could override any country's
nuclear weapons really screwed up.

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,731
That would be Amanda Waller.

33
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,681
How much time do we have?

34
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,927
<i>NW e“ f?</i>

35
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,006
Oliver, I'm the director of ARGUS
and this goes way over my head.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,241
This is executive-level
and this is Department of Defense.

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,448
Right. Right, right, right.
But how much time?

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,126
There's a startup sequence
before Darhk can actually launch a nuke.

39
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,601
We have just under 21 hours.

40
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,968
Yeah, you're gonna have to find a way
to interrupt that sequence.

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,043
Rubicon is a fail-safe
against nuclear Armageddon.

42
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,368
ARGUS designed it to be 100% un-hackable.

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,562
No, she can do it. She's the best.

44
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,246
Uh, actually, that would be my father.
As far as Rubicon's concerned.

45
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,051
It uses Fourier protocols.
Noah practically wrote the book on them.

46
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,441
The world is facing nuclear Armageddon.

47
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,802
My pride and my general dislike
for my father can take a backseat

48
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,405
for the next 20-plus hours.

49
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,762
Felicity, this isn't about pride.
Your father's a criminal.

50
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,961
He can't be trusted.

51
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,050
I'm not saying we should trust him,
I'm saying we need to.

52
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,089
Okay. He got out in Darhk'sjailbreak.

53
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,606
- How do we find him?
- I'm already running a search.

54
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,926
Can you try
and get in touch with Thea, too?

55
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,081
Please, we need her back here.

56
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,442
John, can I talk to you for a second?

57
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,800
- How you doing?
- Been better.

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,481
Well, I'm not going to pretend
to understand what you're going through...

59
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,245
Well, Oliver, you've been through this
with your mother,

60
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,407
which is why I can't quite understand

61
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,567
why you're putting the fate of the world

62
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,727
in the hands of another evil parent.

63
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,008
I'm not trusting Kuttler.
I trust Felicity,

64
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,925
and we should just let her do herjob.
Okay?

65
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,480
We have one of our own.

66
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,682
Yeah. Stopping Darhk.

67
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,606
His magic is powered by death.
So, if even one of those nukes hits...

68
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,121
He'll be unstoppable.
Okay, what's your plan?

69
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,601
Well, if he is planning
on harnessing all of this death,

70
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,371
he's gonna be at
something called a nexus chamber.

71
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,170
Basically, it's a collector of magic.

72
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,920
And here I thought earthquake machines
were as strange as it got.

73
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,647
Esrin Fortuna told me that
one of these chambers exists in Star City.

74
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,007
I'm betting it falls on a ley line.

75
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,202
What'd Vixen call them?

76
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,805
- "Wi-Fi for magic"?
- Yeah.

77
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,803
It's a big city, Oliver,
we've got 21 hours.

78
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,009
One step at a time.

79
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,607
We have to help them.

80
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,365
We're gonna help these people.

81
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,481
What are you looking for?

82
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,051
Well, Reiter and his men
found a way on the island.

83
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,645
There has to be a way off.

84
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,365
There's a plane.
East end of the island. It's far.

85
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,971
We'll make it.

86
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,847
- What's that?
- This may be a way to call for help.

87
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,041
Let's go.

88
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,201
Woof.

89
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,241
I know.

90
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,324
The predictability
was a terrible flaw in the design.

91
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,205
Predictability is your flaw, too.

92
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,045
Every time my life starts to suck,
you show up.

93
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,491
Leave us.

94
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,487
Is that hand a present
from your new best friend?

95
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,207
I'm not doing this for a prosthetic, Thea.

96
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,250
- I'm doing it to keep you safe.
- Keep me safe.

97
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,442
- Yes. Keep you safe.
- Yeah.

98
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,682
Like I said, predictable.

99
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,285
Only thing I don't get is,

100
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,364
how is brainwashing
some guy I really like

101
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,449
in your plan to keep me safe?

102
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,681
His conditioning wasn't my idea.

103
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,929
Ruvé Darhk wanted to assure
his compliance in the final phase.

104
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,611
Final phase of what?

105
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,845
Something called Genesis.

106
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,248
Darhk plans to burn the world
in a nuclear fire

107
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,209
while we are protected down here.

108
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,245
Then he and his followers
can rebuild.

109
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,768
Truth be told,
it's not dissimilar to the plan

110
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,922
I had for the Glades, once upon a time.

111
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,969
But on a much, much larger scale.

112
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,440
Let me guess.

113
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,888
You don't think that destroying
the entire world is completely insane.

114
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,130
The world is what's insane.
It is beyond saving.

115
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,730
It needs a do-over. A reset.

116
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,404
Look, once I realized
Darhk's plan was inevitable,

117
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,567
the math was simple...

118
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,000
Save yourself.

119
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,401
And my daughter.

120
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,730
Even if she doesn't want to be saved.

121
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,445
Look, I am way, way past the point
of telling you

122
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,602
that you are crazy.

123
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,804
I just want to see Alex,

124
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,446
just want to know he's okay.

125
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,648
And, look, I get it, I'm stuck here.

126
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,800
But I can be stuck here and compliant

127
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,081
or I can be a pain in your ass.

128
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,490
So take me to him.

129
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,207
Now.

130
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,641
Hey-

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,809
- Hey, hon.
- Hi.

132
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,005
What's up?

133
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,601
Um...

134
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,362
When I was at your place
this morning, I...

135
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,566
I found this.

136
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,485
What are you doing going through my stuff?

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,525
Snooping.

138
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,246
But this isn't any of your business,
Donna.

139
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,482
No, no, babe. it is my business, actually.

140
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,841
You getting suspended.

141
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,690
- It is, kind of.
- But, Donna...

142
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,491
Hey. What is this?

143
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,204
It's... It's...

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,411
It's an affidavit.

145
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,486
Pike said if I put my name to it,
then I can get my badge back.

146
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,367
It says you didn't know
that Laurel was the Black Canary.

147
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,362
I may not be in Mansa,
but I know how to read, sweetie.

148
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,920
I think it's "Mensa," actually.

149
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,926
You told me
that you knew what Laurel was doing.

150
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,723
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so?

151
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,521
This is a lie.

152
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,011
Yeah, but it's a complicated lie.

153
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,571
- Is it?
- Yeah.

154
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,681
Yeah.

155
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,446
'Cause, according to Pike,
lAB are willing to look the other way

156
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,409
about my working with Darhk,

157
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,566
'cause I was protecting Laurel.

158
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,081
Why would you have to protect her
if she was a superhero?

159
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,890
Yeah, exactly. Now you see?

160
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,805
I see that they're asking you to lie.

161
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,929
Sweetheart. Come on.

162
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,521
All I ever wanted was to be a cop.

163
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,081
Now, what's a small lie if it means
I can do some good for this city?

164
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,605
No.

165
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,922
No, that's just it.
There aren't any small lies, hon.

166
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,488
Take it from someone who had a child
with a man who was a liar.

167
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,926
I'm not Noah Kuttler.

168
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,167
I know, honey, and that's why I love you.

169
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,721
Okay?

170
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,411
I love you,

171
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,809
and that's why I have faith that

172
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,491
you're gonna do the right thing.

173
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,650
Gentlemen.
I've a little errand I need you to run.

174
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,770
A loose end
that needs tying up, not unlike...

175
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,126
Huh.

176
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,483
Do I detect some obstinacy, Mr. Brick?

177
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,803
I'm just used to giving the orders, Darhk.
Not taking them.

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,207
Not even as a little thank-you
for busting you out of Iron Heights?

179
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,851
Whatever happened to gratitude?

180
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,321
I'm here, ain't I?

181
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,649
And when the whole world is sitting
under a field of mushroom clouds,

182
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,450
you'll be glad that you are.

183
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,201
Now then, back to the errand.

184
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,489
Have either of you boys
heard of The Calculator?

185
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,881
There's no one here.

186
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,487
Found a deep-trunk fiber-optic hook-up
with polymorphic encryption.

187
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,841
Noah is there, trust me.

188
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,002
She's right. Look.

189
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,529
Whoever rigged that up
didn't want to be surprised.

190
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,126
I'm tracing the Bluetooth signal.
Head southwest.

191
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,882
Nope. He's not here.

192
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,650
- He has to be.
- He was.

193
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,524
Looks like he bolted,
and in a hurry.

194
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,210
<i>Bolted from whom?</i>

195
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,885
This was 20 minutes ago.

196
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,561
Looks like Kuttlerwasn't
the only one that left Iron Heights.

197
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,049
Those are Ghosts with him.
What does HIVE want with my father?

198
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,605
<i>Okay-</i>

199
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,888
<i>Find the scrawny son of a bitch.</i>

200
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,765
<i>When you do, kill him.</i>

201
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,731
<i>Welcome to Tevat Noah,
your home in the new era.</i>

202
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,882
<i>Please proceed
to the registration building</i>

203
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,526
<i>to receive your residence assignments.</i>

204
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,445
Sorry about that.

205
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,371
Wasn't easy finding my way down here.

206
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,367
You Ghosts are swell at keeping secrets,

207
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,602
but less swell at resisting torture.

208
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,127
So why don't you spare me the trouble

209
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,443
and tell me where I can find Damien Darhk?

210
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,642
You were right.

211
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,450
Kuttler's the only one
that can stop Rubicon.

212
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,444
That's why Darhk wanted him dead.
You all right?

213
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,651
Yeah. The word "conflicted" comes to mind.

214
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,160
Well, at least we know he got away.

215
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,129
With not much of a head start.

216
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,169
I hacked Kuttler's server
to see if there was anything in there

217
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,606
that could point us
to where he would run to,

218
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,404
and he cleared the cache
so I can't recover any files.

219
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,404
But there is a root directory
called Ravenspur.

220
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,005
- What's Ravenspur?
- Don't know.

221
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,083
Does sound familiar.
I just don't know why.

222
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,130
We're running out of time.

223
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,164
The whole world is, so yeah.

224
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,890
Meantime,
my ley line algorithm kicked back

225
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,804
a possible 20
on a magical clubhouse for Darhk.

226
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,446
We drove some of them off,

227
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,845
but Reiter's sending reinforcements.

228
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,202
- Reiter's dead.
- We heard him on the radio.

229
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,281
He's alive.

230
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,771
Map of the island in the pack.

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,684
- Get them to the plane.
- What about you?

232
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,845
I'm gonna find Reiter,
and I'm gonna end this.

233
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,446
Then I am staying, too.

234
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,683
Do you remember what you told me?

235
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,451
It takes a monster to kill a monster.

236
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,330
Now, get these people home.

237
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,885
Felicity just called.

238
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,406
She needs to see me about something.

239
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,880
Everything all right?

240
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,690
I don't know. It's Felicity, so...

241
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,365
You know, you never know.

242
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,526
Are you signing that thing?

243
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,325
Yeah, I was about to.

244
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,565
Hey, before you give me that dirty look,

245
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,882
you might want to read this thing.

246
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,204
- I already read it.
- Just read it, please.

247
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,521
Oh!

248
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,206
- It looks...
- Yeah, it's a little different now.

249
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,686
"Although I was against it at first,"

250
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,690
"I came to see
what Laurel was doing was vital"

251
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,602
"and important and good"

252
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,169
"as the Black Canary."

253
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,730
I gave it a little rewrite.

254
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,001
(Bab)',

255
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,370
lam so proud of you.

256
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,524
Laurel would be, too.

257
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,129
This is me signing my badge away.

258
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,407
No.

259
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,247
You don't know that.

260
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,124
All you can know for sure

261
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,882
is that you're doing the right thing.

262
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,725
Oh! Mr. Dennis.

263
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,130
Ms. Smoak.

264
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,887
You haven't returned my calls.

265
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,645
Yes. I am sorry. I've been busy.

266
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,927
So have I.

267
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,484
Running your company.

268
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,883
Do I need to remind you
of your responsibilities to Palmer Tech?

269
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,724
No, you don't.
But you're just gonna have to believe me

270
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,481
when I tell you that what is on my plate
right now is much more important.

271
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,404
- Hey!
- Hi. Um...

272
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,929
- Should I come back, or...
- No, no, no. Please stay.

273
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,562
- Ms. Smoak, the board...
- Can wait.

274
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,287
Whatever's so important,
I hope it's worth it.

275
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,161
Hi. I like your tie, it's very...

276
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,441
Good.

277
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,766
- Hi!
- Thank you for meeting me.

278
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,162
Of course, my baby girl.

279
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,680
My God.

280
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,206
Are you kidding? I'm always here for you,
as long as there's no bees around.

281
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,771
No bees.

282
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,481
Are you okay?

283
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,968
Does the word "Ravenspur"
mean anything to you?

284
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,205
If this has something to do
with your father, honey...

285
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,886
So it does? Thought I remembered
the two of you talking about it.

286
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,122
Notjust talk. It's a...

287
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,324
It's a cabin in Cypress Cove
we used to like to go to.

288
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,960
We'd, you know,
we'd nurse a bottle of wine,

289
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,127
- make love to Lionel Richie.
- Hmm.

290
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,287
- I was his penny lover.
- Hmm.

291
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,689
You know, your father
could go all night...

292
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,847
Okay, that's enough. I don't...

293
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,170
You know what? Actually, I think
you were conceived in Ravenspur.

294
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,526
Please, make it stop. No, please.

295
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,404
Seriously, honey.
I want to be serious for a minute.

296
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,406
If this has anything
remotely to do with your father...

297
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,644
Don't worry. I have it handled.

298
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,406
I wouldn't be a Jewish mother
if I didn't worry.

299
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,722
Baby. What's that for?

300
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,207
With any luck,
you'll never have to find out.

301
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,327
There's nothing here.

302
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,045
What, did you think
he was gonna put up a sign?

303
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,521
I was thinking more along the lines
of Ghosts with automatic weapons.

304
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,210
Then we should've brought
our work clothes.

305
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,208
- Can I talk to you about something?
- Yeah.

306
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,164
I spoke to Lyla. She's worried about you.

307
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,721
Because you said that
you shot Andy in self-defense.

308
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,251
Oliver, I don't want to talk about this.

309
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,562
You've just never said anything
about self-defense to me, John.

310
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,727
Couldn't tell Lyla the truth

311
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,410
and have her look at me
the same way anymore.

312
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,840
Come on, you don't know that.

313
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,047
Oliver, you're the last person on earth

314
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,686
to lecture someone about lying
to the people they love.

315
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,086
I'm not lecturing.

316
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,287
I'm worried.

317
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,409
You're better than me at this,

318
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,809
and you're hurting worse
than I have ever seen you.

319
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,567
Don't compound that by lying to your wife.

320
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,242
The fact that I lied to Felicity
does not give me less credibility.

321
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,927
If anything, it should tell you
that I know what I'm talking about.

322
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,761
- Yeah?
- Noah's at a cabin in Cypress Cove.

323
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,566
We got him. We're on our way.

324
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,129
You're a hard man to find, Kuttler.

325
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,608
Come out now, we'll make it painless.

326
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,605
Make us work for it, we'll make it last.

327
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,005
I hate it when they run.

328
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,131
You make me chase you any more,
I'm going to put a bullet in you.

329
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,924
Isn't that the plan?

330
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,481
I'm willing to give you a sporting chance.

331
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,208
I heard about this game
when I was in prison, Mr. Brick.

332
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,883
You let me walk if I take you down.

333
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,804
Darhk said
you was a smart bloke.

334
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,845
So, what do you say?

335
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,287
It's the end of the world,
as I understand it.

336
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,048
Don't just stand there. Get in.

337
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,522
- I got him.
- Spartan, fall back!

338
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,047
Let's make this simple.

339
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,561
This isn't a reconciliation.
This isn't a reunion.

340
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,728
This is you helping me save the world.

341
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,285
And what makes you think I can?

342
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,409
Damien Darhk thinks you can.

343
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,841
That's why he sent last year's
greatest hits to take you down.

344
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,764
You're a smart man.
I'm assuming you know what Rubicon is.

345
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,407
And I'm assuming
it's under Mr. Darhk's control.

346
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,920
We have 12 hours to stop it.

347
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,281
That's it?

348
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,086
You seem surprised.

349
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,084
I was expecting a quid pro quo.

350
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,090
Felicity, I may be a terrible father...
_llMayll?

351
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,921
But I'm not a monster.

352
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,570
And terrible or not, I am your father.

353
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,091
As long as you live in it,

354
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,124
I have an interest in seeing
that this world doesn't end.

355
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,443
That said, I do need something.

356
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,244
Color me shocked.

357
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,123
I can't hack Rubicon with this setup.

358
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,964
Not in the time we have.

359
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,447
I'm going to need
the quantum subluminal processor

360
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,761
you developed at Palmer Tech.

361
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,126
How did you even know that we...

362
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,084
God help me
if you're using the end of days

363
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,566
to steal from my company again.

364
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,169
I'm an excellent multitasker,
but you can trust me this time.

365
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,006
- Ms. Smoak...
- Ah, Mr. Dennis. Wow.

366
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,329
You must be very desperate
for me to talk to the board

367
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,125
since you brought security to dragoon me.

368
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,368
These men are not here
to take you to the conference room.

369
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,967
They're here
to escort you out of the building.

370
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,842
Excuse me?

371
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,208
The board has grave concerns
about your plans

372
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,011
to basically give away
the bio-stimulant implant.

373
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,842
They wanted
to discuss the matter with you.

374
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,487
- And I will talk to them.
- It's too late for that.

375
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,771
They voted to terminate you,
effective immediately.

376
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,281
Wow.

377
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,604
Okay, well, I just need to grab something
and I will show myself out. Thank you.

378
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,691
Ah! I'm sorry,
but everything in this lab is proprietary.

379
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,167
We cannot allow you to leave
with company property.

380
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,169
Excuse me? You have to be kidding.

381
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,880
I'm very sorry.

382
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,044
I had hoped
that this would end differently.

383
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,847
All right, folks.
Please move in right on in here.

384
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,041
Have a great day.

385
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,651
Alex?

386
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,367
Hey, you.

387
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,211
You ran off like a crazy person.
Are you feeling better?

388
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,209
Do you know what's going on here?

389
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,890
Yeah, Ruvé told me.

390
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,043
- Isn't it fantastic?
- It is not fantastic.

391
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,326
It's the end of the world.

392
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,090
No, it's just the beginning of a new one.

393
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,846
I got into politics
to make a difference, right?

394
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,201
To make the world a better place,

395
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,051
and Ruvé has shown me
that the only way to do that

396
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,526
is to start over.

397
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,887
Just listen to me.

398
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,687
You are under the influence
of some type of drug right now,

399
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,850
and we need to get out of here.

400
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,046
You're just gonna have to trust me, okay?

401
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,248
Hey. He can trust you later.

402
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,401
Lonnie Machin is here.

403
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,847
He's killed five of Damien's men
that we know about.

404
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,411
Well, there's plenty of ways
I could respond to that,

405
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,567
but I'm going to go with, "Good."

406
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,761
He's hitting the CO2 scrubbers

407
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,520
hours before nuclear weapons
will render the atmosphere above us

408
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,926
unbreathable.

409
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,090
If the Ark's life-support fails,
we all suffocate.

410
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,361
Who's Lonnie Machin?

411
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,088
He's kind of an ex-boyfriend of Thea's.

412
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,762
Well, Damien told me
about your special connection to him.

413
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,088
I need you to help me put him
back in the box, or we're all dead.

414
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,927
You all right? Did you get it?

415
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,248
I got fired.
Before I could take the processor.

416
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,487
I can't even show my face in there.

417
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,324
- Maybe we should call in a bomb threat.
- What?

418
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,164
Just empty the place
or maybe plant an actual bomb.

419
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,640
Just a small one,
one that doesn't hurt anybody.

420
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,564
- But we have...
- All right. Maybe we should just go in.

421
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,242
It's too risky
to wear the gear in the daylight.

422
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,965
What about the elevator at the old lair?

423
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,322
Uh-uh. Mr. Dennis shut it down
after the Larvan attack.

424
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,561
So, John's right.

425
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,161
We'll go in and help you and your father
boost it from...

426
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,606
It's in Curtis' lab.

427
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,610
You want me
to help my father steal from me?

428
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,649
Well, it's not exactly yours anymore,
is it?

429
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,242
Nope. Guess not.

430
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,362
Door is unlocked.

431
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,523
Give me a count of three
and then come on in.

432
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,046
<i>Copy that.</i>

433
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,684
I love all this subterfuge.

434
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,888
Might our guardian angel
be the Green Arrow?

435
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,487
This was a line item on the budget list,
and it's still not fixed.

436
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,284
And they have the gall to fire me?

437
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,730
This is fun, working together.

438
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,246
Let's make this clear.

439
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,165
This is not
a father-daughter bonding exercise.

440
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,082
Felicity, we have personnel
walking the floor.

441
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,201
Just go on my signal.

442
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,720
Copy that.

443
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,241
Look, I know I've done
what appears to be some terrible things...

444
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,925
You tried to steal from me.

445
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,685
Are we not stealing from you now?

446
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,720
No. A, it's not my company anymore,
and, B, we're trying to save the world.

447
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,086
<i>"JOHN". Hey, didn't I say go on my signal?</i>

448
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,201
Okay, now.

449
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,324
I'm good at solving binary problems,
but matters of the heart...

450
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,561
Are not your forte.

451
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,569
And stealing a processor
to save the end of the world

452
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,444
is not the right time
for this conversation.

453
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,721
On some level, I've always told myself

454
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,804
I just didn't know
how to be a father or a husband...

455
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,320
And for a smart guy,

456
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,962
you don't seem to understand
the concept of "not the right time."

457
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,401
I don't know
why I tried to steal your company's tech.

458
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,130
Habit, I suppose.
Or something deeper.

459
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,446
Ah! The son of a bitch.

460
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,166
I've been fired for, like, 45 minutes,
and he's already locked me out.

461
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,485
You have an electromagnetic wave generator
and a battery tender?

462
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,765
To force a restart.

463
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,765
Yes.

464
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,161
Yes.

465
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,251
There it is.

466
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,486
Open sesame.

467
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,281
That's it.

468
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,363
Guys, I've got incoming.
Northeast stairwell.

469
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,806
On it.

470
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,526
It's under a sub-lock.

471
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,282
It won't eject.
That never happens unless...

472
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,561
That happens.
We can't leave without the processor.

473
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,881
We can if we clone it.

474
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,167
Your sniffer device.

475
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,840
We can copy
the processor's operating code wirelessly.

476
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,644
More movement.
Felicity, you must have tripped something

477
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,848
because I have security
coming to the lab right now.

478
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,122
- We're running out of time.
- The device isn't finished.

479
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,242
- Come on.
- It's almost there.

480
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,960
Come on.

481
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,802
Felicity, you have to get out of there.
Security's inbound.

482
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,051
The R and D lab is secure.

483
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,331
I heard you needed a lift.

484
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,083
- You're the one who arrested me.
- He's not doing that now.

485
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,527
- You get it?
- No.

486
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,762
How bad is it?

487
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,287
Kuttler was able to clone
90% of the processor.

488
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,204
He may be able to extrapolate
the remaining 10%

489
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,561
to build us a workable processor.

490
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,250
I'm gathering parts for him to work with.

491
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,885
But we're still gonna need to upload
the override codes

492
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,121
to every nuke silo individually.

493
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,681
- Can you do that?
- Only from a server farm.

494
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,205
Mr. Queen.

495
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,645
My men are searching the woods
for my property.

496
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,363
But you chose not to die with them.

497
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,884
I killed a few of the stragglers.

498
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,131
My power has grown beyond your imagining.

499
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,806
Let me show you.

500
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,528
Valiant effort, Mr. Queen.

501
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,889
But still only mortal.

502
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,250
The primary scrubber's in here.
I'm betting Machin is, too.

503
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,164
Don't I get something to fight him with?

504
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,528
I don't think I can trust you
with a weapon for some reason.

505
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,848
You're just gonna have to make do
with Krav Maga, I'm afraid.

506
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,445
<i>Welcome to Tevat Noah,
your home in the new era.</i>

507
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,005
Ah, the irony.

508
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,168
All Darhk's parasites living underground,

509
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,091
breathing the waste product of sludge.

510
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,251
What happens if I turn this dial?

511
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,410
Well, if you're not gonna tell me,
I'm just gonna have to see for myself.

512
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,607
Step away from that.

513
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,040
Run along, little girl.

514
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,210
I'm a tad busy at the moment
trying to kill everyone here.

515
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,249
I'm not a little girl, Lonnie.

516
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,647
Remember me?

517
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,603
My name is Thea Queen.

518
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,450
I'm the one that gave you that face.

519
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,089
Mommy.

520
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,521
I didn't recognize you
without the red leather.

521
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,722
Whatever are you doing here?

522
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,928
Look, I get it, you're mad at Darhk

523
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,690
because he screwed you over,

524
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,126
and now you're trying to get payback.

525
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,926
I'm not going to stop you, okay?

526
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,646
If anything, I'm gonna help you.

527
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,810
But there are innocent people here,
people that have been brainwashed,

528
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,002
and they don't deserve to die.

529
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,642
Lonnie, don't do this.

530
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,922
I will help you take down Darhk, okay?

531
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,804
We can do this together.

532
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,046
You just need to get out of here.

533
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,891
The hell did you do that for? I had him.

534
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,481
No, you didn't. Explosive charges.

535
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,490
He was going to blow the scrubber
no matter what you said.

536
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,007
- Can you disarm it?
- We'll soon find out.

537
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,285
Clear.

538
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,404
I'm going to need the sub node
taken offline.

539
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,369
- Okay, I can do that.
<i>- I'll</i> cover him.

540
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,002
I'll take care of him.
Get to work.

541
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,570
Nice to meet you.

542
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,691
My daughter certainly has
some very impressive friends.

543
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,962
How long is this gonna take?

544
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,931
Ideally, less than it takes Mr. Darhk
to nuke the world.

545
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,202
I'm not the man
my daughter thinks, you know.

546
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,050
Don't tell me. Tell her.

547
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,685
I've tried.

548
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,402
I've tried explaining that
there are two sides to me,

549
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,489
the father and the hacker.

550
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,721
She sees only the criminal.

551
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,445
I mention this because you strike me

552
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,331
as someone with experience
leading a dual life.

553
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,525
Any insights you'd care to share?

554
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,722
Yeah. <i>n</i> doesn't work.

555
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,569
You leading a dual life
is why you lost her.

556
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,048
You sound like you're talking
from some personal experience.

557
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,247
What's that?

558
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,728
Felicity's taken the sub node offline
and we've developed a new problem.

559
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,888
- What?
- Tapeworm in the Rubicon code.

560
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,885
An anti-hack failsafe
courtesy of your friends in HIVE.

561
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,087
Well, can you override it?

562
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,486
I just did.

563
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,331
But not before the tapeworm transmitted
this terminal's location.

564
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,602
- I figure we have about 90 seconds.
- Until what?

565
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,282
Until HIVE rains
all manner of hell down on us.

566
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,087
What happened?

567
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,931
HIVE has our position.
We have maybe a minute before they arrive.

568
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,043
They're working on shutting me down,
but I know a few tricks.

569
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,520
This'll go twice as fast with two of us.

570
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,404
We'll hold them off as long as we can.

571
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,009
Establish a perimeter. Shoot to kill.

572
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,763
I don't need to tell you
what's riding on this.

573
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,288
POTUS and SecDef have taken us
to DEFCON 2.

574
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,608
- Just 2? They're optimistic.
- They don't want to cause a panic.

575
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,564
The President asked me
if the fate of the world is resting

576
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,128
in the hands of an IT girl, a criminal
and two guys in Halloween costumes.

577
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,924
They're not Halloween costumes.

578
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,761
Get the idol!

579
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,891
We got to go.

580
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,167
What about Reiter?

581
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,850
He can't do anything without the idol.

582
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,006
Come on!

583
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,486
If this is the end of the world,
I don't mind going out like this.

584
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,847
Oh, don't you ever stop?

585
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,963
Not when it comes to my daughter. No.

586
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,406
Alex?

587
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,327
Everything's fine.
We took out all the explosives.

588
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,443
Alex? Alex. Oh, God, are you...

589
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,328
Fine? Okay? Hunky-dory?

590
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,323
Believe me, there's nothing hunky-dory

591
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,727
about screwing up someone's plan
for vengeance a second time.

592
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,685
Which means I've got to wait
for Mr. Darhk to arrive.

593
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,251
Go with Plan B.

594
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,082
It's left me with some time to kill.

595
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,241
Soto speak.

596
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,521
- Okay, Alex, come on...
- Relax.

597
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,763
He's fine. Just taking a little nap.

598
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,530
What is it with you?

599
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,926
Why are you always
at the mercy of some guy?

600
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,410
You can make your own decisions, Thea.

601
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,090
You're not a pawn,

602
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,531
you're a queen.

603
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,927
Get it?

604
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,080
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.

605
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,601
Here they come.

606
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,801
That's a lot of firepower...

607
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,961
We don't need to beat them.

608
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,088
We just need to buy Felicity
and her father enough time.

609
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,321
Thea?

610
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,845
Alex, get out of here.

611
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,321
Get away from him.

612
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,284
I'm liberating you, Mommy.

613
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,525
You don't need another man
clouding your mind.

614
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,000
Alex, run!

615
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,011
No.

616
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,121
Alex.

617
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,206
No.

618
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,211
I'm sorry.

619
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,602
Think I got an algorithm
down to 300 lines for the uplink.

620
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,250
Have you tried to break
the JSI encryption?

621
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,603
- That way you can directly bypass the PAL.
- Yeah, you're right.

622
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,170
Three minutes
till Rubicon launches the nukes.

623
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,122
Overwatch. Amar is headed inside.

624
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,167
We're running out of time.

625
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,481
Are you hit?

626
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,327
No, no, no.No.

627
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,443
- What's happening?
- We got every nuke.

628
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,841
Except one.

629
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,405
We lost one. It's in the air.

630
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,165
Headed straight for Monument Point.

631
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,482
The bullet went through,
but I need you to hold still.

632
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,008
I think we have more important concerns.
Such as preventing another launch.

633
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,321
I thought you two
stopped Rubicon.

634
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,530
Rubicon knows the missiles didn't launch,
it keeps trying to send launch codes.

635
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,011
Which we have to override manually,
one by one.

636
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,167
It's kinda like whack-a-mole.

637
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,004
Except we don't get a stuffed animal
if we win.

638
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,049
Is it true, there's one in the air?

639
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,526
Headed straight for Monument Point.

640
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,688
- Can you override?
- That is what I'm trying to do

641
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,803
while Noah keeps the missiles
in their silos.

642
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,241
We need to start evacuations.

643
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,330
There's not enough time
to get everyone out.

644
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,683
This is ARGUS director Lyla Michaels.

645
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,564
I'm reporting an end-time event.

646
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,561
Target is Monument Point.

647
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,402
Felicity.

648
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,170
I'm trying to hack
their navigation systems.

649
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,487
What's that?

650
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,404
Another hit
on the ley line algorithm I set up.

651
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,569
I cross-referenced it
with news reports and...

652
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,166
The mayor's office just evacuated
City Hall due to a gas leak.

653
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,847
Like you said, why would Darhk's wife run
for mayor of a city he wants to destroy?

654
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,443
To gain access to City Hall.

655
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,247
For this exact moment.

656
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,570
The nexus chamber
must be beneath that building.

657
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,564
If he's hiding where he should be hiding
to absorb the power of the nuke attack.

658
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,886
Let's go.

659
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,085
You need to divert that missile.

660
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,050
You are lucky I'm too busy to come up
with a witty response to that right now.

661
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,408
Stop. Stop!

662
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,280
Taiana. Are you okay? Are you hurt?

663
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,286
Something's...

664
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,928
- Got it. Mostly.
- What?

665
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,765
I sent the remaining launch algorithms
into an infinite loop.

666
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,281
Should buy the world 24 hours,
give or take.

667
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,931
What about the nuke
headed to Monument Point?

668
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,127
It's stubborn.

669
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,526
There's a reason why these things
were designed

670
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,125
to be impossible to move off course.

671
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,886
Which is why
I have to move Monument Point instead.

672
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,122
- GPS realignment.
- What do you mean?

673
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,322
As a prank,
I once relocated a GPS satellite.

674
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,521
Everyone on the Eastern Seaboard thought

675
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,451
they were 20 miles west
of their actual location.

676
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,648
Do that to the missile,
you avoid a direct hit.

677
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,526
That's it.

678
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,410
Direct hit on Havenrock.

679
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,050
Maximum yield.

680
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,245
How many casualties?

681
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,411
Tens of thousands.

682
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,051
Monument Point would have been
a couple million, Felicity.

683
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,890
Damn it, we've searched everywhere.

684
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,250
Hello, Oliver. Nice timing.

685
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,766
I think you're gonna need
much bigger arrows.

686
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,921
