1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,220
Hello.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,620
- He's on a bus with William.
- Who's William?

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,660
He's the hottest, coolest guy
in all of third-year.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,030
Invite me to dinner with your mom.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,940
- Friday.
- Yeah, Friday.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,940
Guess who's invited to a pre-party
with the Penetrator guys?

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,260
- Are you kidding?
- Really, Eva?

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,140
William asked me if I wanted to
go outside with him. I think he wants to hook up.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,520
Jonas (27 minutes ago):
What about that dinner?

10
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,520
SHAME

11
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,840
FRIDAY, 4:11 P.M.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,020
- Hi, Thea! Is Jonas in?
- Yeah, he's in the living room.

13
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,460
Your girlfriend is here.

14
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,540
- Hey.
- Hi.

15
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,910
What are you playing?

16
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,490
FIFA.

17
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,780
- What's up?
- What?

18
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:39,020
Where's your russ crew today?
Don't you have a shitload to do?

19
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:45,100
It's only two years and seven months until
russ time. You'd better start working.

20
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,060
I know. I'm really jealous of you guys

21
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,120
who spend your time
on more constructive things...

22
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,460
like playing video games all day long.

23
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,000
What are you mad about now?

24
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,680
I'm not mad.
I'm kidding, have a sense of humor!

25
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,880
I need to talk to you.

26
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,020
Drama!

27
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,300
What's wrong?

28
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,500
What's wrong with you?

29
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,600
There's nothing wrong with me.

30
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,050
Okay... so...

31
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,510
why haven't you replied to my messages?

32
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,570
I was busy.

33
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,080
So you're not...

34
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,950
You're not mad I forgot
our thing yesterday?

35
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,500
No, no. I...

36
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,600
- I don't care.
- You don't care?

37
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,420
Yeah, don't worry.

38
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,910
- Okay, good.
- Good.

39
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,270
Fine.

40
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,800
- Yeah, I'll be on my way.
- You're welcome to stay.

41
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,710
No, I have a lot of stuff to do.

42
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,780
- Yeah, I'll call you.
- Yes.

43
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,800
MONDAY, 3:11 P.M.

44
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,350
He doesn't want to talk about it,
and he claims he's not pissed,

45
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,940
but I don't believe that.

46
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,050
But isn't he just pissed because he thinks
you don't want him to meet your mom?

47
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,140
Maybe he thinks you're
embarrassed of him?

48
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,750
You think so?

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,650
- Just let him meet your mom. What's the problem?
- Long story.

50
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,580
Just so you know, I told Chris to tell Sana
that she can't be on our bus any longer.

51
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,520
- Why?
- Hello?!

52
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,950
She nearly ruined our entire social status,
and I had to fix it.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,810
I had to explain to the Penetrator guys

54
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,840
that we're not the kind of girls
who create a lot of drama.

55
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,250
We made a really bad impression.

56
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:18,310
- Might it not have been Sana's fault?
- Have you met Sana? She's incredibly rude.

57
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,630
Well, Sara and Ingrid
aren't the nicest people in the world either.

58
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:25,940
I know Sara and Ingrid really well, and they're
not the kind of girls who start drama.

59
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,790
Well...

60
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
William...

61
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,580
What's up with you two?

62
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,120
I think we're going to sleep together.

63
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,590
Okay?

64
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,480
Not to be a prude, but don't you think you should
get to know him a little better first?

65
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,340
Why? He's perfect.

66
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:52,250
I'd much rather want my first time
to be with the hottest, coolest, '97 guy

67
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,500
than someone random.

68
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,260
- You'll always remember your first time.
- It's your first time?

69
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,580
I've also heard that William is
really, really good in bed.

70
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,710
You don't usually get an orgasm your first time.
But with him, you do.

71
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,650
- I've heard about five girls who got it.
- Okay...

72
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,130
Hello?! Show some support,
I'm doing this for you guys too!

73
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,760
This will guarantee us
a spot on their bus.

74
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,260
Vilde...

75
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,120
But I was wondering something...

76
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,920
- Can I borrow the pill from you guys?
- You can't borrow the pill.

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,790
I didn't mean one pill,
I meant like for a week or something.

78
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,670
- I'm not on it.
- Me neither.

79
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,610
Aren't you sleeping with your boyfriend?

80
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,480
I use a NuvaRing,
and you don't want to borrow that.

81
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,680
- Where can you get it?
- At the doctor's.

82
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,900
So much effort,
can't you just order it online or something?

83
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,540
- I don't know.
- Just go to the school doctor, then?

84
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,500
- Can you come?
- Why?

85
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,260
Because it's really embarassing
to go there alone.

86
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,620
And it's so much less embarassing
if we came...

87
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,180
Of course we can come, Vilde.

88
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,580
William!

89
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,650
WEDNESDAY, 12:35 A.M.

90
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,720
- Hey, are you awake?
- Yeah, I can't sleep.

91
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,020
- What are you doing?
- It's just boring work.

92
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,870
No wonder your grades are going down,
if you don't sleep at night.

93
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,500
I definitely won't get any sleep
if we're going to talk about grades.

94
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,840
- How are Ingrid and Sara doing?
- Why do you have to interrogate me all the time?

95
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,300
Sweetie, it was just a normal question.

96
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,780
Yeah. Yes, they're doing fine.

97
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,650
I got myself a boyfriend.

98
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,230
Oh?

99
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,660
- Who is it, then?
- Who?

100
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,720
I thought I could just introduce you to him.

101
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes!

102
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,480
- I mean, before you leave again?
- Uh-huh.

103
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,360
Maybe... we can invite him over for dinner?

104
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,020
Yes.

105
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,660
- When are you leaving again?
- Saturday morning.

106
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,520
Maybe Friday night, then?

107
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
How nice.

108
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,400
WEDNESDAY, 1:15 P.M.

109
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,190
Hi!

110
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,640
Are you friends again, or what?

111
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,210
This is Noora. I've told you about Noora.

112
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,170
- Noora.
- Hello. Jonas.

113
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,140
- We have an appointment at the school doctor.
- Yeah, where is Vilde?

114
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,290
Vilde will meet us there.

115
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,660
- What's going on at the doctor's?
- We're helping a friend get laid.

116
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,700
- Okay, good luck with that.
- Thanks!

117
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,370
- You guys are so slow!
- Sorry!

118
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,680
- But, are you doing anything on Friday?
- There you are!

119
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,570
- What is she doing here?
- I have something to tell you!

120
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
- How did you know we were here?
- Eva's boyfriend told me.

121
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,510
- Did you tell your boyfriend?!
- I have the best news in the world!

122
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,860
- Sana sold all the toilet paper!
- Vilde Lien?

123
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,090
- I'm serious!
- How did she manage that?

124
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:39,150
I don't know! She said you just had to
send her your account number and address.

125
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,400
- Are you kidding?
- No!

126
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,030
- Can she please join our bus?
- It's not something illegal?

127
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,220
- No, no! She's Muslim.
- What's that got to do with it?

128
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,410
No, but Muslims go to hell
if they do something illegal,

129
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,360
and I don't think she wants to do that.

130
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:58,460
- Welcome! Everyone. What can I help you with?
- She's going to sleep with a guy.

131
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,170
You're so lucky!

132
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,570
For the first time.

133
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,570
Yeah. That's not so simple.

134
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,170
- What do you mean?
- My cousin bled so much that she got anemia.

135
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,780
- That's bullshit.
- No,

136
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,440
you might bleed during your first intercourse.

137
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:26,780
Large bleedings should be taken seriously
,because they can in fact kill you.

138
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,780
She just got a little weak.

139
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,260
Then she was lucky.
I actually had a patient once who bled so much

140
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,650
that we feared she would die.

141
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,760
- Because she had sex for the first time?
- No, she cut herself. Tried to commit suicide.

142
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,860
She bled so much that we had to
give her something called a blood transfusion.

143
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,390
But she just wants to go on the pill.

144
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,070
Right. When will the intercourse take place?

145
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,050
On Friday.

146
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,100
- On Friday?!
- Friday?

147
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,280
- On Friday?
- That's what I was trying to say,

148
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,980
I'm meeting William on Friday,
and I thought we could pre-party at Eva's.

149
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,210
Are we drinking?
Aren't you the one having sex with him?

150
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,830
I can't drink by myself,
you have to support me.

151
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,710
Why do you have to drink at all?

152
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,930
That's not possible anyway,
my mom will be home, and Jonas is coming.

153
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,260
- Please, we'll just--
- Have you girls seen one like this before?

154
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,830
Can anyone show me how to put on a condom?

155
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,740
It's difficult to open...

156
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,040
It tends to be...

157
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,220
Let's see now...

158
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,350
There we go!

159
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,140
FRIDAY, 7:47 P.M.

160
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,280
Honestly now, how painful is it?

161
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,230
I don't remember anything
from my first time.

162
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,490
Just drink, you won't feel anything.

163
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,800
Do you want to be so drunk
that you don't remember anything?

164
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,420
- Were you drunk your first time?
- Me? No.

165
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,130
Pinch my arm. How much does it hurt?

166
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,880
- Seriously?
- It doesn't resemble pinching.

167
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,660
If you just relax, it won't hurt.

168
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,260
How do you know? You haven't had sex!

169
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,340
Okay, seriously. William needs to call soon.

170
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,370
What was his last text?

171
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,160
"Picking you up at 7,
we'll do something chill. W."

172
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,230
It's ten to eight, can't you just call him?

173
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,040
I don't want him to think I'm desperate for dick.

174
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,180
- But what if he doesn't send a message?
- Then I would be a little bit relieved.

175
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,100
Vilde, you don't have to have sex with him
if you don't want to.

176
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:06,180
- I want to! But I just don't want it to hurt.
- No, but that's why you have to relax.

177
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:11,690
- What about him turns you on?
- Turns me on?

178
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,050
- Yeah, what makes you horny?
- Horny...

179
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,320
- Nothing. I don't get horny.
- You're never horny?

180
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,990
No. Are you?

181
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,280
Yes!

182
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,260
Then I really don't get why you don't have sex.

183
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,120
Hey, I bet I can make you horny.

184
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,520
I'm not doing some kind of lesbian thing.

185
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,580
Vilde, it's not some lesbian thing.

186
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,160
Just listen to me, turn around to
lie on your back and close your eyes.

187
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,040
Imagine you and William
standing in the bedroom.

188
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,620
Are you imagining it?

189
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,520
- Yes.
- What's happening?

190
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,370
- What's happening?
- Yeah, describe it.

191
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,650
We're standing in the bedroom.

192
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,520
- I'm wearing a white dress.
- That's good, continue.

193
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,730
Okay!

194
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,240
The dress is almost the same as that
Stella McCartney dress,

195
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,400
with lace at the bottom.

196
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,730
Except it doesn't have lace at the bottom.

197
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:18,570
I have my hair down. No! I'm wearing it up.
But it's a bit loose so my hair falls down some.

198
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:26,180
I'm wearing light pink lipstick. Not the lightest
from Mac, but the one that's kind of medium.

199
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,610
This actually works!

200
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,810
- Really?
- I think so.

201
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,450
You get horny by talking about
clothes and make-up?

202
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,610
Yes!

203
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,840
People get horny from different things.

204
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,550
I was watching a documentary about
a whole village that got horny from donkeys.

205
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,780
Eva?

206
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,820
I'm coming!

207
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,780
Okay, you guys have to leave now.

208
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,890
We can't go. He hasn't texted yet.

209
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,410
Go to your place, then.

210
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,820
I can't go home, I've been drinking.

211
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,180
Can't we just sit here?
We'll be quiet.

212
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,300
Eva?

213
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,870
Yeah, I'm coming!

214
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,290
Okay, okay! But you have to be really quiet.

215
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,690
And leave through the window, okay?

216
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,470
- Hi!
- Hi. Shouldn't your boyfriend be here by now?

217
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,380
Yes, but... he sent a message
that he's a bit delayed.

218
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,810
Okay.

219
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,290
To Jonas:

220
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,290
Where the hell are you?

221
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,860
- It smells good, do you need help?
- No, it's fine.

222
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,100
What was that?

223
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,570
I think I forgot to turn off the movie.
I'll fix it.

224
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,300
- What are you doing here?
- Is Vilde here?

225
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,640
No... yes, but you can't come here.

226
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,650
- Hi! Nice to meet you.
- Hi. William.

227
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,980
No, no. This isn't my boyfriend.
This is Vilde's boyfriend.

228
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,460
Oh, really? Who's Vilde?

229
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,580
A friend. William thought Vilde was here,
but she isn't, so he's leaving now.

230
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,280
Chris! Noora! Vilde!

231
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,690
What are you guys doing here?

232
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,090
We...

233
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,310
remember when I borrowed your jacket?

234
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,870
Well, we thought we'd bring it over.

235
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:38,760
But... you weren't in your basement,
so we left it outside your bag.

236
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,200
No, I mean the window!

237
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,770
Yeah, thanks.
But I'm sure you're leaving again, right?

238
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:52,500
Yeah, we have so many jackets to deliver.
So we'll just...

239
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,810
- See you! Come on.
- Bye!

240
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,580
- What's going on here, Eva?
- Nothing's going on.

241
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,460
- Were those girls drunk?
- No.

242
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,940
- Where the hell are you?
- Sorry, but I can't come tonight.

243
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,440
What do you mean?

244
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,830
- I forgot I had to help my mom with a thing--
- Can't you help her tomorrow?

245
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,470
No, it's really important.
I have to do it now.

246
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,740
- Who was that?
- That was my sister.

247
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,650
- Jonas!
- I'm sorry, but I really have to go now. Sorry.
