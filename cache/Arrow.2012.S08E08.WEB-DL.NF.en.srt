EVERY ARROW YOU'VE FIRED,
THEY HAVE ALL LED YOU HERE

160
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:40,330
TO THIS MOMENT,
TO THE ULTIMATE FIGHT.

161
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,998
WHO AM I FIGHTING?

162
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,875
NOT WHO.

163
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,793
WHAT.

164
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,421
THE ANTI-MONITOR.

165
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,217
THE MONITOR'S
ADVERSARY.

166
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,135
NOT JUST ADVERSARY.

167
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:58,056
A BEING WHO STANDS
AGAINST ALL THERE
EVER WAS OR WILL BE,

168
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,850
THE APOCALYPSE ITSELF
GIVEN LIFE AND FORM

169
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,352
AND TERRIBLE PURPOSE.

170
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,978
HOW DO I BEAT HIM?

171
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,730
WITH HELP.

172
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,483
IT'S TIME TO GET
YOUR FRIENDS.

173
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,818
BARRY, WAIT.
YOU LOOK SPENT.
YOU NEED TO REST.

174
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,321
NO. I'M FINE.
I HAVE TO TRY AGAIN.

175
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,156
SARA: BARRY, THAT'S
A BAD IDEA, OK?

176
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,533
THE EFFORT ALONE
COULD KILL YOU.

177
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,118
IT'S BETTER THAN JUST
STAYING HERE.

178
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,494
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET
YOU KILL YOURSELF.

179
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,121
GET OUT OF MY WAY!

180
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,289
J'ONN: BARRY!
SARA: WE'RE NOT LETTING YOU

181
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,623
GO ANYWHERE.

182
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,125
SO TRY AND STOP ME!

183
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,501
IN THE CONDITION
YOU'RE IN, BARRY,

184
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,044
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
THAT HARD.

185
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,837
CUT IT OUT!
WHATEVER'S GOING TO HAPPEN

186
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,507
IS NOT GOING TO INCLUDE
US TURNING ON EACH OTHER.

187
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,176
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE THE SPEED FORCE

188
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,844
IS OUR LAST, BEST HOPE.

189
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,514
OLIVER: IT IS.

190
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,225
THE SPEED FORCE IS
THE KEY TO SAVING YOU.

191
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,772
IT'S THE KEY TO
SAVING EVERYONE.

192
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,450
OLIVER?

193
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,035
YES AND NO.

194
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,703
IT'S COMPLICATED.

195
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,914
NICE OUTFIT. HEH.

196
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,583
VERY...SITH.

197
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,545
OLIVER?

198
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,589
I AM OLIVER QUEEN,

199
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,383
BUT I'M ALSO
SOMETHING MORE.

200
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,675
MORE WHAT?

201
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,886
SOME MIGHT CALL ME
A GHOST,

202
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,556
A SPECTRE THAT'S
IN TUNE

203
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,308
WITH THE ENTIRE
MULTIVERSE.

204
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,725
SO THERE'S STILL
A MULTIVERSE OUT THERE?

205
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,145
NO. IT'S GONE,

206
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,314
REPLACED WITH
ITS ANTITHESIS.

207
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,107
AN ANTI-MATTER
UNIVERSE.

208
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,984
WHICH WE NEED
TO PREVENT
FROM HAPPENING.

209
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,944
RIGHT NOW,
THE ANTI-MONITOR

210
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,779
IS AT THE DAWN
OF TIME,

211
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,532
FIGHTING TO MAKE
PERMANENT HIS

212
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,492
DESTRUCTION
OF WORLDS.

213
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,370
THEN WE GO THERE,
AND WE END HIM.

214
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,330
OLIVER: HE'S
EXTREMELY POWERFUL.

215
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,500
THE 8 OF US MIGHT
NOT BE ENOUGH.

216
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,001
WE NEED
A BACKUP PLAN.

217
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,836
YOU HAVE OUR ATTENTION.

218
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,922
SEVERAL MILLENNIA AGO
ON A PLANET NAMED MALTUS,

219
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,592
MAR NOVU ATTEMPTED TO
TRAVEL TO THE BIRTH
OF THE UNIVERSE

220
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,387
BUT INSTEAD OPENED
A BREACH

221
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,929
TO THE ANTI-MATTER
UNIVERSE.

222
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,807
LEX: SO THE MONITOR
GAVE US THE ANTI-MONITOR.

223
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,893
OLIVER: CORRECT.
SO WHILE SOME OF US

224
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,646
FIGHT AT THE DAWN
OF TIME,

225
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,231
OTHERS MUST GO
TO MALTUS.

226
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,316
AND PREVENT NOVU FROM
FREEING HIS DOPPELGANGER?

227
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,609
I'M IN.

228
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,361
TRAVEL TO AN ALIEN WORLD?
SO IN.

229
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,071
SAME.

230
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,073
COME ON. YOU KNOW YOU
DON'T WANT TO RISK

231
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,741
LETTING ME OUT OF YOUR
SIGHT FOR EVEN
A MILLISECOND.

232
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,619
BARRY: WE CAN GET TO BOTH
THROUGH THE SPEED FORCE,

233
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,414
BUT I CAN'T GET
INTO THE SPEED FORCE
RIGHT NOW.

234
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,958
IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE
THERE'S NO MULTIVERSE LEFT,

235
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,044
BUT YOU SAID YOU'RE IN TUNE
WITH THE MULTIVERSE.

236
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,795
DOES THAT INCLUDE
THE SPEED FORCE?

237
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,964
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME
IS VERY DANGEROUS, BARRY.

238
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:42,011
BUT POSSIBLE.
YOU COULD GIVE ME
THE ENERGY BOOST I NEED.

239
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,013
PLEASE.

240
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:47,392
WE HAVE TO DO THIS.
EVERYONE'S LIVES
DEPEND ON IT.

241
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:00,779
I'VE UNLOCKED
YOUR POTENTIAL, BARRY.

242
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,323
BY TOUCHING MY HEAD?

243
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,075
USE THIS POWER
WITH CAUTION.

244
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,163
DO YOU TRUST ME?

245
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,083
ARE YOU OLIVER QUEEN?

246
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,002
YES.

247
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,797
THEN I TRUST YOU
WITH EVERY CELL
OF MY BODY.

248
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,385
GOOD. NOW RUN, BARRY.

OHH!

251
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,286
OK.

ASSIST.

ALIEN FOREST LOOK
MORE ALIEN?

254
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,960
LET'S FOCUS. MAR NOVU
COULD BE ANYWHERE,

255
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,172
AND IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN
JUST DO AN INTERNET
SEARCH FOR HIM.

WELL, ACTUALLY,
MAYBE WE CAN.

257
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,176
LOOK AT THAT.

258
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:07,263
ANY CITY THAT LARGE
HAS TO BE A BUREAUCRACY.

259
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,307
AND?

260
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,267
WELL, BUREAUCRACIES
REQUIRE SOME FORM

261
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,437
OF CENTRAL DATA BANK
TO FUNCTION.

262

WE FIND THAT,
WE FIND NOVU.

THE FIRST ONE I DID MISS,

ATTACKED.

WE WERE SEPARATED,

VARIOUS PIECES

FIRST MET.

THAN MEMORY

AND CLOSEST ALLIES

288
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,696
TO KEEP ALL OF US
FROM FALLING OUT
OF THE SPEED FORCE.

00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,907
WAIT. WHAT HAPPENS
IF THEY FALL OUT?

290
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,200
