00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,207
Listen, Judy,
you know we never had problems with Pablo.

157
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,171
Plus, we had a very good relationship
with Kiko. Right, Berna?

158
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,210
- Yes.
- And that's why we made the decision

159
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,089
to stay out of this shit.

160
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,810
And that has been a good decision
for business as well?

161
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,001
Because things are very difficult.

162
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,244
And when all this shit is over,
the organization will change,

163
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,051
the routes will change,
this whole city will change.

164
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,122
And how do you know
you'll still be in business, Judy?

165
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,407
That's why I'm talking to you.

166
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,847
If all of us from Medellin are united,

167
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,969
we'll be able to say what happens
to each one of us.

168
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,405
Meet me at Montecasino
with our associates,

169
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,847
and you tell them you're on our side.

[Héctor]
She wants them to join Los Pepes.

171
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,091
They say Pablo Escobar is fucked,
that his time has come.

172
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,522
And that they have to decide
whose side they're on.

173
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,844
- What did they say?
- They're joining.

174
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,404
Here's the information.

175
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,606
They have a meeting
with the Castafios on Friday.

176
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,525
[La Quica]
This is big, boss.

177
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,811
If the Galléns are with them,
maybe some of the other guys are too, huh?

178
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,091
[Pablo]
When is it?

179
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,970
[La Quica]
Friday at 9:00 p.m., boss.

180
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,685
[Pablo]
Take that address...

181
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,521
and go to Montecasino.

182
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,761
Take Limén with you.

183
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,002
And find out what's going on over there.

184
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Quica.

185
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,166
Are you all right?

186
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,969
Yes, boss.

187
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,282
How many men can we rely on?

188
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,446
I think I can round up a hundred.
But we need cash.

189
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,961
How much money do we have on hand?

190
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:02,764
If we collect all the money in
the stash houses, that should be enough.

191
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,606
It's... around this much.

192
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,488
I'm still waiting on a cash shipment
from Miami.

193
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,450
But it's harder than ever
to get it through.

194
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,005
Make sure we have the weapons and the men
we need when the time comes. Got it?

195
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,685
The only thing that matters now is getting
Tata and the children out of the country.

196
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,602
Then we can take care of business.

Get in a room with him

We're already gone.

Bogoté police just busted Blackie.
Maybe he'll cut us a deal.

This is the biggest lead we've ever had.

327
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,256
- La Quica can give us Pablo.
- We can help triangulate from the air,

but really only units on the ground
can find him.

329
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,883
So that means that we have to drive around
Medellin hoping to get lucky

330

and La Quica is using his phone?

He will be because we'll be calling him
with Blackie's phone.

He picks up, we get a signal.

I believe firmly in what the colonel said.

What's happening, Pablo?
