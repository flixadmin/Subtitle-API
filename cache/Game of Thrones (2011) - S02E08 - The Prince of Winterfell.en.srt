1
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,794
MAN 1: Riders approaching!
MAN 2: Open the gate!

2
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:38,032
- YARA: Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.
- (MEN LAUGHING)

3
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,661
- Envy isn't attractive.
- What envy?

4
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,747
You should be proud
of your brother's achievement.

5
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,333
I took the great castle of Winterfell
with 20 men.

6
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,210
You're a great warrior.

7
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,838
I saw the bodies above your gates.

8
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:56,175
Which one gave you the tougher fight,
the cripple or the six-year-old?

9
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,260
(MEN LAUGHING)

10
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,681
I treated the Stark boys with honor,
and they repaid me with treachery.

11
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,934
You treated them with honor?
By butchering them?

12
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,269
Before I had to kill them,

13
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,146
- I treated them...
- You seized their home, as is your right.

14
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,940
We're ironborn, we take what we need.

15
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,024
Exactly.

16
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:15,194
Then you made them prisoners in their home
and they ran away.

17
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,946
Is that treachery?

18
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,282
I'd call it bravery.

19
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,869
- They made me a promise...
- Your little boy prisoners made you a promise

20
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,580
and you got mad when they broke it?

21
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,248
Are you the dumbest cunt alive?

22
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,958
- Don't call me...
- A cunt.

23
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:32,920
A dumb cunt who killed
the only two Starks in Winterfell.

24
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,464
You know how valuable those boys were?

25
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,384
If I hadn't killed them,
the Northerners would think me weak.

26
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,220
You are weak. And you're stupid.

27
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,305
I'm warning you.

28
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,684
Go on, then. Warn me.

29
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,357
You haven't brought enough men.

30
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,651
How am I supposed to
defend Winterfell with just this lot?

31
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:56,736
You're not.

32
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,906
I've come to bring you home.
Father wants a word.

33
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,657
Is this a joke?

34
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,075
Winterfell is the heart of the North.

35
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,120
Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea.

36
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,082
We're islanders, baby brother.
Had you forgotten that?

37
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,002
Our power comes from our ships.

38
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,547
And now that you've decorated your walls
with the bodies of the Stark boys,

39
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:19,842
every man in the North wants
to see you hanged.

40
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,346
- When Robb Stark finds out...
- He won't find out.

41
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,972
We've killed all the ravens.

42
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,016
We have all the horses.

43
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,269
I've taken Winterfell.

44
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,564
And I will keep Winterfell.

45
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:37,944
Leave us.

46
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,751
Theon, you're my blood.

47
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,588
We both loved our mother.

48
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:00,383
We both endured our father.

49
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,845
Come home with me. Don't die here alone.

50
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,889
I don't intend to die.

51
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,397
You were a terrible baby, do you know that?

52
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,068
Bawling all the time, never sleeping.

53
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,072
And one night, you just wouldn't shut up,

54
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,366
screaming like a dying pig.

55
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:30,746
I walked over to your crib,
I looked down at you.

56
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,957
I wanted to strangle you.

57
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:37,461
And you looked up at me
and you stopped screaming.

58
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,339
You smiled at me.

59
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,138
Don't die so far from the sea.

60
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,364
I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones.

61
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,702
I already got one crow. Don't need two.

62
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,954
Mance will want to question this one.

63
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,457
Knows all about where the crows are
and what they're planning.

64
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,210
The Halfhand knows more.
This one is just a little boy.

65
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,336
Gut him.

66
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,298
He could have killed me half a dozen times.

67
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,674
And now he wishes he did.

68
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,384
Gut him.

69
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,846
He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son.

70
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,268
Mance will want him.

71
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,730
What does Mance want
with a dead man's bastard?

72
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,065
I don't know.

73
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,276
I think he'll want to decide for himself.

74
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,078
He runs, I'll chop his balls off.

75
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,789
He runs, I'll do it meself.

76
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,799
We're even now, Jon Snow.

77
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,225
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

78
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,939
I couldn't do it.

79
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,108
I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't...

80
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,359
I know.

81
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,736
The others?

82
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,614
When you didn't come back,
we went looking for you.

83
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,158
We found your tracks fast enough.

84
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,911
But they found us before we found you.

85
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,247
They died because of me.

86
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,708
See that it wasn't for nothing.

87
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,918
MAN: All right, up, lad.

88
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,212
Come on, on your feet, now.

89
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,547
Move it.

90
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,513
Is she beautiful?

91
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,307
I've never met her.

92
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,434
What's her name?

93
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,563
Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name.

94
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,400
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

95
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,236
(LAUGHING)

96
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,864
And you're marrying her for a bridge?

97
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,699
- An important bridge.
- Ah.

98
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,911
It was before they killed my father.

99
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,373
I still thought I could march south
and rescue him in time,

100
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,917
but only if I crossed that bridge.

101
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,672
When I speak to people from the North,

102
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,966
they all loved your father.

103
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,511
He was the best man I ever met.

104
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,264
I know children always think that
about their fathers, but...

105
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,435
Children do not always think that
about their fathers, believe me.

106
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,982
He once told me
that being a lord is like being a father,

107
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:49,612
except you have thousands of children
and you worry about all of them.

108
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,615
The farmers plowing the fields
are yours to protect.

109
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,784
The charwomen scrubbing the floors,
yours to protect.

110
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,454
The soldiers you order into battle.

111
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:04,710
He told me he woke with fear in the morning
and went to bed with fear in the night.

112
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,755
I didn't believe him.

113
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:13,135
I asked him,
"How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"

114
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,307
"That is the only time a man can be brave,"
he told me.

115
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,437
I wish I could have met him.

116
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,482
He would have liked you.

117
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,528
Most lords worry more about their gold
and their glory

118
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,364
than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.

119
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,825
- He didn't care much about gold or glory.
- And you?

120
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:41,288
You think I'm fighting this war
so they'll sing songs about me?

121
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,415
I want to go home.

122
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,878
- I want the men following me to go home.
- Then why don't you?

123
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:51,757
Because we'll never be safe
until the Lannisters are defeated.

124
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,926
And because I believe in justice.

125
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,388
- Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean.
- That would be a start.

126
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,597
(HORSE NEIGHING)

127
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,108
Your Grace, milady.

128
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,569
The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.

129
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:17,449
How?

130
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,872
Tell me this isn't true.

131
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,962
Why?

132
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,257
For the girls.

133
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,508
- You betrayed me.
- Robb...

134
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,718
No!

135
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,596
You knew I would not allow it
and you did it anyway.

136
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:44,143
Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell.

137
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,271
Sansa and Arya are
captives in King's Landing.

138
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,940
I have five children,
and only one of them is free.

139
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:53,902
I lost one son fighting by your son's side.

140
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,573
I lost another to the Kingslayer,
strangled with a chain.

141
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:02,411
You commit treason
because your children are prisoners?

142
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,790
I would carve out my heart
and offer it to the Father,

143
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:11,295
if he would let my sons wake
from their graves and step into a prison cell.

144
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,839
- I grieve for your sons, my lord.
- I don't want your grief.

145
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,966
I want my vengeance.

146
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,260
And you stole it from me.

147
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,766
Killing Jaime Lannister
would not buy life for your children,

148
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,519
but returning him to King's Landing
may buy life for mine.

149
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,856
Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool.

150
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,193
You've weakened our position.

151
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,903
You've brought discord into our camp.

152
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,490
And you did it all behind my back.

153
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,371
- Make sure she's guarded day and night.
- Robb.

154
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,831
How many men did we send
in pursuit of the Kingslayer?

155
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:48,999
Forty, Your Grace.

156
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,086
Send another 40 with our fastest horses.

157
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,670
Robb.

158
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,227
(GROANS)

159
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,523
JAIME: Damn.

160
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,487
You're much uglier in daylight.

161
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,239
What's your name?

162
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,119
I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock,
son of Tywin.

163
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,582
A captive knight has
a right to know his captor's identity.

164
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,251
Brienne of Tarth.

165
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,336
Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.

166
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,047
Crescent moons and starbursts.

167
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,715
Lord...

168
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,885
Selwyn Tarth. Your father.

169
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,057
Do you have any brothers and sisters,
my lady?

170
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:51,270
It's a long way to King's Landing.
Might as well get to know one another.

171
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,398
Have you known many men?

172
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,607
I suppose not.

173
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,401
Women?

174
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,485
Horses? Ah.

175
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,948
I didn't mean to give offense, my lady.
Forgive me.

176
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,576
Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer.

177
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,203
Why do you hate me so much?
Have I ever harmed you?

178
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,874
You've harmed others,
those you were sworn to protect,

179
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,293
the weak, the innocent.

180
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,504
Has anyone ever told you
you're as boring as you are ugly?

181
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,132
You will not provoke me to anger.

182
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,843
I already have. Look at you.

183
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,428
You're ready to chop my head off.

184
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,389
Do you think you could?

185
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,183
Do you think you could beat me
in a fair fight?

186
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,143
I've never seen you fight.

187
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,936
The answer is no.

188
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,482
There are three men in the kingdoms
who might have a chance against me.

189
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,066
You're not one of them.

190
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,570
All my life men like you have sneered at me.

191
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,490
And all my life I've been
knocking men like you into the dust.

192
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,701
If you're so confident, unlock my chains.
Let's see what happens.

193
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,497
Do you take me for an idiot? In!

194
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,878
I took you for a fighter, a man...

195
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,547
Pardon. Woman of honor.

196
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,467
Was I wrong?

197
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,135
You're afraid.

198
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,015
Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer.

199
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:27,324
KEVAN: King's Landing will fall
an hour after Stannis lands his force.

200
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:33,830
It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei
and the court to ride west to safety.

201
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,124
Surrender the Iron Throne?

202
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,419
Better than seeing their heads mounted
on the city gates.

203
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,755
Stannis will execute them all.

204
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,217
No, a king who runs will not be king for long.

205
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,761
He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight.

206
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:53,850
Stannis, two days from the capital
and the wolf at my doorstep.

207
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:57,980
The scouts assure us
Robb Stark remains north ofAshemark.

208
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,732
Ha! The last time the scouts assured us
of Stark's movement,

209
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,317
he lured us into a trap.

210
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,822
Which is why my son is his prisoner.

211
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,327
Too close to Casterly Rock.

212
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,291
He sent a splinter force
to recapture Winterfell.

213
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,002
The Greyjoys have done us a great favor.

214
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,881
Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock
until he's at full force.

215
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,175
He's a boy and he's never lost a battle.

216
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,013
He'll risk anything at any time

217
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,391
because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.

218
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,192
We'll ride at nightfall.

219
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,195
I want a full night's march
before he knows we're on the move.

220
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:51,283
Clegane, you'll maintain
a garrison here at Harrenhal.

221
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,202
Track down this brotherhood
and destroy them.

222
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,833
The girl has proven herself a good servant.

223
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,169
She'll stay on with you.

224
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,212
See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings.

225
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:09,468
He's poor company when he's sober,
but he's better at his work.

226
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,269
GUARD: You've got some
questions to answer.

227
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,229
Who killed Ser Amory?

228
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,815
MAN: I don't know! Please!
GUARD: Give me the name.

229
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,861
GUARD: Take this one out for the crows.
MAN: I told you, I don't know.

230
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,113
Please.

231
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,575
Look, it's Yoren's little cunt.

232
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,453
Used to be a boy, now it's a girl.

233
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,080
Where's Jaqen?

234
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,665
Don't care.

235
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,751
Where's your stick now, bitch?

236
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,461
I promised to fuck you with it.

237
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,172
GUARD: Come on, time to kill some wolves.

238
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,725
You need sour cherries to make it right.

239
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,895
And the secret is you dry the stones,
and then you break them with a mallet.

240
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,232
That's where the real flavor is.
You crush 'em up real fine.

241
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,484
And then when you're finished,
you sprinkle them over the piecrust.

242
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,568
Where's Jaqen?

243
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,445
- How would I know?
- I need him now.

244
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,116
- Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
- You need him?

245
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,951
He's helping me.

246
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,120
- HOT PIE: I saw him.
- Where?

247
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,041
- Where? Where?
- Ow!

248
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,377
They went riding out the gates
a few hours ago.

249
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,628
On patrol.

250
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,839
Let go of my ears.

251
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,173
(HORSE NEIGHING)

252
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,595
What do you want with him anyway?

253
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,321
QHORIN: Mance is gonna march on the Wall.

254
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:57,659
When he does, one brother inside his army
will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.

255
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,828
- They'll never trust me.
- They might.

256
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,705
- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?

257
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,416
(SHOUTING) How does it feel
knowing those men all died

258
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,586
so you could skip through the snow
with your little savage girl?

259
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,254
- I didn't.
- I should have known better,

260
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,339
trusting a traitor's bastard.

261
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,430
He's not yours to kill, crow.

262
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,704
Do you have to do that here?

263
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,000
I like to keep me hands clean.

264
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,337
Yes, but do you have to do it here?

265
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,972
You should start wearing the gold cloak.

266
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,516
I don't want to wear a gold cloak.

267
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,643
You're commander of the City Watch.

268
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:08,271
- You shouldn't be dressed like a common...
- A cloak slows you down in a fight.

269
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,524
Makes it hard to move quietly.

270
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:14,319
And the gold catches the light,
so you're nice and easy to spot at night.

271
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,614
Well, you're not
sneaking through alleyways any longer.

272
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,907
You're supposed to stand out.

273
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,077
We had a deal
and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.

274
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,787
Fine, fine.

275
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,415
No gold cloak.

276
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,258
What?

277
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,009
- What?
- What? What?

278
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,469
Why are you staring at me?

279
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,974
You don't want me cleaning me nails.
You don't want me looking your way.

280
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,142
Why am I here?

281
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,395
To help me plan
the defense of King's Landing.

282
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,521
(LAUGHS)

283
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,773
- Stannis will be here any day.
- (SIGHS)

284
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,112
And one of these explains how to beat him?

285
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,700
"An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros."

286
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,077
By Archmaester Shevelathin.

287
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,621
Shevelatesh.

288
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,206
Chevalteesh.

289
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,546
I'd swap all your books
for a few good archers.

290
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,673
My Lord Hand. Commander.

291
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:20,176
I must compliment you
on the gold cloaks' performance

292
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,386
these last few weeks.

293
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:25,724
Did you know there has been
a marked drop in thievery?

294
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,351
I did not know.

295
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,771
And how did you accomplish
this marked drop in thievery?

296
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,983
Me and the lads rounded up
all the known thieves.

297
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,944
For questioning?

298
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,195
No.

299
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,699
It's just the unknown thieves
we need to worry about now.

300
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,744
- We talked about this.
- Aye, we talked about it.

301
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,914
Have you ever been in a city under siege?

302
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,499
Maybe this part's not in your books.

303
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,461
See, it's not the fighting
that kills most people. It's the starving.

304
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,213
Food's worth more than gold.

305
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,967
Noble ladies sell their diamonds
for a sack of potatoes.

306
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:04,304
Things get bad enough,
the poor start eating each other.

307
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,515
The thieves, they love a siege.

308
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,518
Soon as the gates are sealed,
they steal all the food.

309
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,314
By the time it's all over,
they're the richest men in town.

310
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:19,861
Given the circumstances, my lord,
I believe extreme measures are warranted.

311
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,072
Ah.

312
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,283
"The Great Sieges of Westeros."

313
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,452
Thrilling subject.

314
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,665
Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan
wasn't a better writer.

315
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,421
Stannis knows King's Landing.

316
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,800
He knows where the walls are strongest,

317
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,178
and he knows which gates are weakest.

318
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,766
The Mud Gate.

319
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,103
A good ram will batter it down in minutes,

320
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,522
and it's only 50 yards from the water.

321
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,399
That's where he'll land.

322
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,193
And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate,

323
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,070
what is our plan?

324
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,781
We could throw books at his men.

325
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,241
We don't have that many books.

326
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,742
We don't have that many men, either.

327
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,912
What do we have?

328
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,873
Pig shit.

329
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,558
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

330
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,394
I'm not cut out for this sort of work.

331
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:38,481
I always imagined meself
doing something much worse.

332
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,276
We're digging latrine pits
at the end of the world.

333
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,319
I can't imagine anything much worse.

334
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,239
You lack imagination.

335
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,702
Where do you think Jon is right now?

336
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,580
He went off with the Halfhand.
He didn't come back.

337
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,623
A betting man would go with dead.

338
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,752
He's not dead.

339
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,879
No, Jon's a great fighter.

340
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,132
Well, he's better than me
and a lot better than you.

341
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,302
He's got a Valyrian steel sword.

342
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,679
So did his father.

343
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,557
And Qhorin Halfhand
is the greatest ranger alive.

344
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,435
Great rangers never get old is the problem.

345
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,270
Shit ones neither.

346
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,316
It's them in the middle that last a long time.

347
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:23,276
(METAL CLANGS)

348
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,615
What in seven hells is that?

349
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,633
The First Men made these marks.

350
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,343
Help me with it.

351
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:54,641
(GRUNTS)

352
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,024
Look.

353
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,697
If you find something you're not supposed to,

354
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:13,076
best thing to do
is pretend you've never seen it.

355
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,161
That's a Night's Watch cloak.

356
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:16,913
It's been here a long time.

357
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,378
Oh.

358
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,296
Must be dragonglass.

359
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,756
GRENN: Dragonglass?

360
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,425
The maesters call it obsidian.

361
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,971
Why would a brother hide it here?

362
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,891
I expect it's 'cause
he wanted somebody to find it.

363
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,440
Mind where you're going.

364
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,701
I'm sorry. I'll...

365
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,662
Where were you?

366
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,997
A man has patrol duty.

367
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,875
Tywin Lannister was right here,
and now he's gone.

368
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,918
A girl owes one more name.

369
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,004
The Red God demands it.
Give the man a name.

370
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:11,593
How long after I give you the name
does it take you to kill someone?

371
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,512
A minute, an hour, a month.

372
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,599
Death is certain,

373
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,351
the time is not.

374
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,687
He's taking his army to attack my brother.

375
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,814
I need him dead right now.

376
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,275
This a man cannot do.

377
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,111
You promised you'd help me.

378
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:33,198
Help was not promised, lovely girl.
Only death.

379
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:37,493
There must be others. Give a name, any name.

380
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,370
And you'll kill them?

381
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,456
Anybody?

382
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,545
By the Seven New Gods
and the Old Gods beyond counting,

383
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,214
I swear it.

384
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,635
All right.

385
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,975
Jaqen H'ghar.

386
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,484
A girl gives a man his own name?

387
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,153
- That's right.
- Gods are not mocked.

388
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,739
- This is no joking thing.
- I'm not joking.

389
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,282
A man can go kill himself.

390
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:17,742
Un-name me.

391
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,244
- No.
- Please?

392
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:22,997
I'll un-name you.

393
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,876
- Thank you.
- If you help me and my friends escape.

394
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,755
This would require more than one life.

395
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,925
- This is not part of our bargain.
- Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.

396
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,885
A girl lacks honor.

397
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:47,063
If I do this thing, a girl must obey.

398
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,856
A girl will obey.

399
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,862
A girl and her friends will
walk through the gate at midnight.

400
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,910
Thank you, Podrick.

401
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,210
Odd little boy.

402
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,713
I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.

403
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,173
You and Varys both.

404
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,303
Excellent lamprey pie.

405
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,472
Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day?

406
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,766
I hear Joffrey plans on fighting.

407
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:26,185
An inspiration for the troops.

408
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,895
The young king in his shining armor

409
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,648
fighting to defend the capital
against the wicked old rebel.

410
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,608
He's only a boy.

411
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,403
Younger boys are off fighting his war.

412
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,573
- He's not ready.
- What is he, 17?

413
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,951
- Remember Jaime at 17?
- Better than you.

414
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:45,038
Some men have a gift for this sort of thing,

415
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,956
some don't.

416
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,750
His place is not on the battlefield.

417
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,002
It's not on the throne, either,

418
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,837
sadly for all of us.

419
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,176
Do you think I'm an idiot?

420
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,511
No, I'd say you possess
above-average intelligence.

421
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,014
You shipped off my only daughter.

422
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,100
And now you want to send my eldest son
to the battlefield to die.

423
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,519
He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him.

424
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,522
He has the finest armor gold can buy.

425
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,191
He needs to be out there.

426
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:16,861
The men will fight more fiercely
seeing their king fighting beside them

427
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,489
instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts.

428
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:21,908
Any dessert?

429
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,495
Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?

430
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,873
Because he has
thousands of spies in his employ.

431
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,751
Because he knows everything we do
before we do it.

432
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,211
Because he doesn't have a cock.

433
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,546
Neither do you.

434
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,717
Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.

435
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:43,846
You, on the other hand,
are as big a fool as every other man.

436
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,725
That little worm between your legs
does half your thinking.

437
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,477
- It's not that little.
- (LAUGHS)

438
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:57,735
Why are you smiling?

439
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,821
Because I'm happy.

440
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,864
And why are you happy?

441
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,538
Because I have your little whore.

442
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,584
I thought you preferred blondes.

443
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,420
Such a droll little fellow.

444
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,255
Tell me, have you married this one yet?

445
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,298
No?

446
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,135
Good. Father will be so pleased.

447
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,262
Why do you care who I fuck?

448
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,931
Because a Lannister always pays her debts.

449
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,474
You stole my only daughter,

450
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,184
you plot to have Joffrey killed.

451
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:33,229
This is madness. Stannis will be here in days.

452
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,605
- You need me.
- For what?

453
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,524
Your skill in battle?

454
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,528
Pretty thing, your whore.

455
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,947
Lovely body.

456
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,741
The bruises will heal in time.

457
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,995
Where did you find her?

458
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,330
Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers.

459
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,250
Really, a Lannister lion necklace?

460
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,962
You need to hide your secret whores
more carefully.

461
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,923
You've forgotten the most
important thing about whores.

462
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,008
Oh?

463
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,511
Well, you're the expert. Tell me.

464
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,556
You don't buy them,

465
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,475
you only rent them.

466
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,270
You're usually a better liar, baby brother.

467
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,772
This one you like.

468
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,734
You like her very much.

469
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:21,986
Could it be love?

470
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:25,907
Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough.

471
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,492
Unless Joffrey is hurt.

472
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,870
And then every wound he suffers,
she'll suffer, too.

473
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,914
And if he dies,

474
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:38,836
there isn't a man alive who could devise
a more painful death for your little cunt.

475
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,176
And how do I know
you haven't killed her already?

476
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,469
Would you like to see her?

477
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,179
I thought you might.

478
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,140
Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.

479
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,647
(DOOR OPENING)

480
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,550
I'm sorry they hurt you.

481
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,761
You must be brave.

482
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:36,477
I promise I will free you.

483
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,772
Don't forget me.

484
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,649
Never.

485
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,033
(DOOR OPENING)

486
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,452
(DOOR CLOSING)

487
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,336
I will hurt you for this.

488
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:06,424
A day will come
when you think you're safe and happy,

489
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:10,011
and yourjoy will turn to ashes in your mouth.

490
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,097
And you will know the debt is paid.

491
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,017
Get out.

492
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,155
Shae!

493
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,493
I've been waiting all night.

494
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,162
What is wrong?

495
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,164
You're beautiful.

496
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,382
Then why do you look sad?

497
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,099
We have to be more careful.

498
00:32:57,184 --> 00:33:00,102
Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.

499
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,731
There are people who want to hurt me.

500
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,775
I know. I won't let them.

501
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,569
I'll cut off their faces. I will.

502
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,743
I would kill for you. Do you know that?

503
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:20,498
I expect I'll have to before this is over.

504
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:24,752
You're mine.

505
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,047
I'm yours.

506
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,675
Promise me.

507
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,681
I'm yours, and you are mine.

508
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,653
ROBB: Still no word?

509
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:54,281
We've sent a dozen ravens.
None have returned.

510
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,203
My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell.

511
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,330
- Once he captures the castle...
- Theon has my brothers.

512
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:05,126
- If we storm the castle...
- He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

513
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:10,297
They're his only hope
of escaping the North with his head.

514
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,634
Send word to your son.

515
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:19,598
Any ironborn who surrender will be allowed
to return safely to their homes.

516
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,185
A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace.
Too much...

517
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,939
Any ironborn with the exception
of Theon Greyjoy.

518
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,067
He betrayed our cause.

519
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,820
He betrayed me.

520
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,614
And we will hunt him down
no matter where he runs.

521
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,909
I expect his countrymen will turn on him
the minute they hear the offer.

522
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,790
Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace.

523
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,292
My lady.

524
00:34:58,472 --> 00:34:59,972
How are you?

525
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,184
How am I?

526
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,436
I've had to arrest my mother.

527
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,605
The Lannisters have my sisters.

528
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,357
The man I considered my closest friend

529
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,651
has seized my home and my brothers.

530
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:15,529
I'm fighting a war and I don't know
if I should march south or north.

531
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,908
I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.

532
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,367
No.

533
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,827
Forgive me.

534
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,704
You're being kind.

535
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,916
- I have no right.
- You have every right.

536
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,334
You're a king.

537
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,503
That's not the kind of king I want to be.

538
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,130
What kind do you want to be?

539
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,215
I don't know.

540
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,716
The good kind.

541
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,388
Most kings grew up as princes.

542
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,767
They spend their whole lives
preparing for the crown.

543
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,478
I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.

544
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,107
I was raised to be a proper little lady,

545
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:57,321
to play the harp and dance the latest steps
and recite Valyrian poetry.

546
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,739
I'd like to hear you play the harp.

547
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,866
- No. No, you would not.
- (CHUCKLES)

548
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,250
How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry

549
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,127
to sawing off men's feet?

550
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,348
When I was 12,

551
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,059
my mother and father went to a wedding.

552
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:30,312
Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know.

553
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,107
And they left me with my little brother.

554
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:38,320
The second afternoon they were gone
was the hottest day in the three-year summer.

555
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:43,075
We couldn't bear to be inside,
so we ran down to the Rhoyne.

556
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,453
Every child in Volantis
was in the Rhoyne that day.

557
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,957
The rich, the poor, we were all there.

558
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,419
Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands.

559
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,922
Drummers were playing
for coppers on the east bank.

560
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,553
I was treading water,

561
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,514
talking to a friend,

562
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,726
when I realized I hadn't seen my brother.

563
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,353
I called his name.

564
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,149
Then I started screaming his name.

565
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,485
And then I saw him...

566
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,488
floating face down.

567
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,993
My heart just... stopped.

568
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,453
I was...

569
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,001
I dragged him from the water.

570
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,962
My friend helped me, I think.

571
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:39,006
I don't even remember.

572
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,344
He was so little.

573
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,473
Then we pulled him onto the riverbank.

574
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:52,436
And I screamed at him and I shook him.

575
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,814
And he was dead.

576
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,984
Just dead.

577
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,615
A man ran over.

578
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,620
He had a fish tattoo on his face.

579
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,582
In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos.

580
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:17,044
So you know what they are
without having to talk to them.

581
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:20,130
And this man worked on a fishing boat.

582
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,633
And he pushed me out of the way.

583
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:28,347
You have to understand,
for a slave to push a highborn girl,

584
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,558
that's death for the man, a terrible death.

585
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,312
But he pushed me out of the way,

586
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:40,734
and he started pressing on my brother's chest

587
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:44,321
again and again and again,

588
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,492
until my brother spat out

589
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:52,079
half of the Rhoyne and cried out.

590
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,791
And the man cradled his head
and told him to be calm.

591
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,675
I decided two things that day.

592
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:10,264
I would not waste my years planning dances
and masquerades with the other noble ladies.

593
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,767
And when I came of age,

594
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,188
I would never live in a slave city again.

595
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,362
(SIGHS)

596
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:26,947
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

597
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:30,367
You told me of your problems
and I've blathered on.

598
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:33,203
I don't want to marry the Frey girl.

599
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,125
I don't want you to marry her.

600
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,298
But you needed that bridge.

601
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,969
I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.

602
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,883
(CHUCKLES)

603
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,019
(MOANING)

604
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,454
HOT PIE: The sour cherries
was all crushed up and ready.

605
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:58,622
GENDRY: Shut up.

606
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,542
HOT PIE: Probably in the piecrust by now.
In the oven.

607
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,044
The nice, warm oven.

608
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,255
Shut up. What did you bring?

609
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,133
The cheese could be better.

610
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:10,676
I did get some nice sausages.

611
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,303
What did he want us
to do about those guards?

612
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,888
He didn't say.

613
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,640
He just said, "Walk through the gates."

614
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,850
What about the guards?

615
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,810
He didn't say anything about the guards.

616
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,478
What, he left that bit out?

617
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,105
It's a pretty important part, don't you think?

618
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,274
We have to trust him.

619
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,441
Trust him?

620
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,653
You trusted him to fight with us
when you set him free and he ran.

621
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,697
- I want to go back to the kitchens.
- Shut up.

622
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,074
Stay here if you're afraid.

623
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,453
HOT PIE: Arry, don't.

624
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,400
Away!

625
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,776
Reset!

626
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:21,121
If the wind holds,
we'll reach King's Landing in a day.

627
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,539
Will it hold?

628
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,918
Can't make promises for the wind,
Your Grace.

629
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,378
MAN: Again, pull!

630
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,218
I admire you, Ser Davos.

631
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:37,512
I thank you, Your Grace. Pleased to hear it.

632
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:41,558
Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight
and think they insult you.

633
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,894
So you take the onion for your sigil,

634
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,396
sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.

635
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,440
My son wishes me to change it.

636
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,818
Three mermen with tridents,
something like that.

637
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:55,906
I understand why
the older families look down at me.

638
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,908
Do you? Why?

639
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,953
- My father was a crabber.
- And?

640
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:05,040
Well, sons of lords don't like
to break bread with sons of crabbers.

641
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,583
Our hands stink.

642
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:09,044
And where were those lords
when Storm's End starved?

643
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,546
Many fought bravely for your brother.

644
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:14,258
Many fought for the Mad King.

645
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,719
You defend these men
who insult you behind your back.

646
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,472
Some are happy to do it to my face.

647
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,432
We were forgotten.

648
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,227
Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes.

649
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:29,398
The glorious rebels
marching from battle to battle,

650
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,692
liberating towns
from the yoke of the Mad King,

651
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,111
while I held Storm's End with 500 men.

652
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,613
- No one has forgotten, Your Grace.
- No? Robert did.

653
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:39,908
He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war.
Renly never fought a day in his life.

654
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:43,537
- He was only a boy.
- Then why'd he give him Storm's End?

655
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,834
First, we ate the horses.

656
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:52,462
We weren't riding anywhere,
not with the castle surrounded.

657
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,631
We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses.

658
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:57,968
Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine.

659
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,803
I do like dogs.

660
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:03,432
Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them.
Then the rats.

661
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,644
The night before you slipped through,
I thought my wife was dying.

662
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,938
She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail.

663
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,483
And then you made it through the lines.

664
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:16,820
Slipped right through
in your little black sailboat with your onions.

665
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,656
And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.

666
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:21,992
Every man in Storm's End wanted
to kiss you that night.

667
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,369
I was relieved they did not.

668
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:29,916
Robert told me to hold Storm's End,
so I held it.

669
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:34,421
Then he told me he was giving it to Renly,
so I gave it up.

670
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,215
Insult or no, I gave it up.

671
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,176
Because Robert was my older brother,
and he was the king

672
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,345
and I've always done my duty.

673
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:45,682
But now, I'm the rightful king
by every law of Westeros.

674
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,809
And when I sit the Iron Throne,
you'll be my Hand.

675
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,564
Your Grace,

676
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,943
I pray I serve you well.

677
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,781
I expect you'll be the first crabber's son
to wear the badge.

678
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:09,289
You're the Master of Whisperers.
You're supposed to know everything.

679
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:12,334
No man can be in all rooms at all times.

680
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,212
I have many little birds in the North, my lord,

681
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:19,716
but I haven't heard their songs
since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.

682
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:23,595
The Stark forces are distracted.
Now is the time to strike.

683
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,305
To strike?

684
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:29,017
My dear nephew, you do see these men
preparing the walls for siege?

685
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:32,646
You do understand
Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

686
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,023
If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores
of King's Landing,

687
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:36,900
I'll ride out to greet him.

688
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,819
A brave choice, Your Grace.

689
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,655
I'm sure your men will line up behind you.

690
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:44,991
They say Stannis never smiles.

691
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,494
I'll give him a red smile

692
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,287
from ear to ear.

693
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,294
Imagine Stannis' terror.

694
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:58,839
I am trying.

695
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:01,925
You're an intelligent man.

696
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,635
I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.

697
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,514
Oh, no one disputes that, my lord,
not even the multitudes who despise you.

698
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:10,517
I wish we could converse
as two honest, intelligent men.

699
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,185
I wish we could, too.

700
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,356
What do you want?

701
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,150
Tell me.

702
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:22,362
If we're going to play, you'll have to start.

703
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,704
My brother was
the youngest Kingsguard in history.

704
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:34,749
My sister became queen at the age of 19.

705
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,670
When I reached manhood,

706
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:42,507
my father put me in charge of all the drains
and cisterns in Casterly Rock.

707
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,759
A most highborn plumber.

708
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,803
The water never flowed better.

709
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:49,639
And all the shit found its way to the sea.

710
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,726
I never expected to have any real power.

711
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,728
So when my father named me acting Hand...

712
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,730
You're quite good at being Hand, you know?

713
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,900
Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men.

714
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,985
Honorable men.

715
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,863
But they disdained the game
and those who played.

716
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,199
- You enjoy the game.
- I do.

717
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,868
Last thing I expected.

718
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,286
And you play it well.

719
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,497
I'd like to keep playing it.

720
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,127
If Stannis breaches the gates,
the game is over.

721
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:23,131
They say he burns his enemies alive
to honor the Lord of Light.

722
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,009
The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned,

723
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,678
the Drowned God wants them drowned.

724
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,597
Why are all the gods such vicious cunts?

725
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,309
Where is the god of tits and wine?

726
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:39,105
In the Summer lsles,
they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats.

727
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,108
We should sail there immediately.

728
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,363
This morning, I heard a song

729
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:50,283
all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste.

730
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,285
Daenerys Targaryen lives.

731
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:57,249
A girl at the edge of the world
is the least of our problems.

732
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,251
She has three dragons.

733
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,338
But even if what they say is true,

734
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,299
it'll be years before they are fully grown.

735
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:09,636
And then there will be nowhere to hide.

736
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,347
One game at a time, my friend.

737
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,901
JORAH: Careful, Khaleesi.

738
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:29,447
Xaro owns this city and the warlocks
have a thousand eyes watching for you.

739
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,367
I found one.

740
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,453
A ship with a good captain.

741
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,247
She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.

742
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,707
Astapor?

743
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,041
We cannot stay here.

744
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:43,253
They have my dragons.
A mother does not flee without her children.

745
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,297
They're not your children.

746
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:49,134
I know they call you the Mother of Dragons
and I know you love them,

747
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,760
but you didn't grow them in your womb.

748
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,305
They didn't suckle at your breast.
They are dragons, Khaleesi.

749
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,807
And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.

750
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:59,519
You should sail to Astapor.
I'm sure you'll be safe there.

751
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,940
You know I would die for you.

752
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,319
I will never abandon you.

753
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,404
I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.

754
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,531
Then serve me.

755
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:15,160
If my dragons are in
the House of the Undying, then take me there.

756
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,120
That's what the warlock wants.

757
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,830
He told you so himself.

758
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,708
If you enter that place,
you will never leave again.

759
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,794
- His magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?

760
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,881
You saw me step into the fire.
You watched the witch burn.

761
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:31,176
What did the flames do to me?
Do you remember?

762
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,930
Until my last breath, I will remember.

763
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:40,727
After I have forgotten my mother's face.

764
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,317
They are my children.

765
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,863
And they are the only children I will ever have.

766
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,746
Take me to them.

767
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,885
We should bury them.

768
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:17,931
I'd leave 'em up a few more days.
Sends a message.

769
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:21,267
If they haven't got the damn message yet,
a few more days won't help.

770
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,978
As you say.

771
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,232
But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.

772
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:31,111
- What's this?
- Gold for the farmer.

773
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,238
For his trouble.

774
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:35,240
His troubles are done.

775
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,702
He's feeding the crops now.

776
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,453
His wife, too.

777
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:45,709
You want to keep a man silent,
you silence him.

778
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:07,981
OSHA: Got as far
as the farm and then doubled back.

779
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,611
Walked through the stream
to throw off the hounds.

780
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:19,159
Hoped this would be the last place
they'd think to look.

781
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,787
LUWIN: You're right

782
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:24,330
so far.

783
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:29,169
OSHA: Who was that
out there hung up at the gates?

784
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,590
Must have been the farmer's boys.

785
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,051
OSHA: He killed them and burned them

786
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,431
and passed them off as the little lords?

787
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,517
LUWIN: They mustn't know.

788
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,354
Bran would blame himself.

789
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,315
OSHA: They'll never hear it from me.

790
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:54,569
The little lads have suffered enough.
