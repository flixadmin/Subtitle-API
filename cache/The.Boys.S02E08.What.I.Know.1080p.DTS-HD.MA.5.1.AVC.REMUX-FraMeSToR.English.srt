1
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:12,471
Okay, this is insane.

2
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:15,641
- We need more Compound V!
- Absolutely.

3
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:17,059
We need more Supes!

4
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:22,231
<i>More Supes! More Supes! More Supes!</i>

5
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:23,316
Come with me.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,693
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,698
I'm sleeping in a basement
beneath a pawn shop in East Flatbush.

8
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,158
I never wanted that for you.

9
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:34,619
[Homelander] We have
Ryan's best interests at heart.

10
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:37,288
- I want us to be a family.
- They flew me up and showed me!

11
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,415
This house, the neighbours are fake.
You're fake.

12
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,334
No! Ryan!

13
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,502
You have five minutes
to make your opening...

14
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:59,936
[man] There's a supervillain
on your school campus.

15
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,854
You hear the calls of distress.

16
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:04,023
You witness a violent display
of superpowers.

17
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,191
What do you do?

18
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:06,859
I'm Sheriff Ed Flanagan,

19
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:09,946
and I'm here with Homelander
to talk about school safety.

20
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,448
On the first report
of an active supervillain,

21
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,784
a hero will immediately
rush to your campus.

22
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:20,081
But to stay alive in the moment,
remember, stay calm and follow the LAW.

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,042
Lock all doors and windows.

24
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:27,755
Arm yourselves.

25
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,466
Your teacher should have
an authorised firearm.

26
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,680
But use whatever you can.

27
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:40,184
And wait for a hero.

28
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,438
[woman screaming]

29
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:48,234
[Ed] Unfortunately, the possibility that
you will experience a supervillain attack

30
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,777
grows more likely every day.

31
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,823
By having an action plan,
you can increase your chances of survival.

32
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,367
And survival is all that matters.

33
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:02,206
- [reporter] <i>Coverage of the attack...</i>
- Jody! Where's my flag pin?

34
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,499
[Jody] How should I know?

35
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,876
Well, I can't go to this thing
without a flag pin.

36
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,879
Bob, before he makes any decisions,
just let me talk to him.

37
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:13,175
One, the president doesn't like you,
he used the word "standoffish."

38
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,261
And two, he's decided.

39
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:18,639
He's declaring a national emergency,
bypassing the FDA,

40
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:22,685
and authorising Compound V for use
by law enforcement and first responders.

41
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,563
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- I wish I were.

42
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,815
Doses are going for 5 million a pop.

43
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:31,444
Pentagon's got a big order in,
and ICE is next in line.

44
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:35,323
You can't release V into the mainstream,
we're talking an avalanche of Supes.

45
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:36,407
It's suicide.

46
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,285
In one hour,
I will be standing at the memorial service

47
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:42,955
for the fallen heroes of the House attack,
with my flag pin!

48
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,626
Giving my thoughts and prayers
and pledging to keep America safe.

49
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,087
The best way to do that
is with Compound V.

50
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,839
[Victoria] We know. We there, remember?

51
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:55,926
Covered in my chief of staff's brains.
There was no terrorist, it was Vought.

52
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,970
It's a fucking coup.

53
00:02:58,054 --> 00:03:01,140
- A bunch of their guys died too.
- To cover their own tracks.

54
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:06,604
For the record, I agree with you.
And I hate this.

55
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,939
But you've got no proof.

56
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,858
Folks are scared.

57
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,152
If Vought took a shit
in the middle of Fifth Avenue,

58
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,904
they'd throw a ticker tape parade.

59
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,990
- Here's what we do have, Bob...
- Oh, let me guess.

60
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:21,285
A tape of me fucking my kid's nanny
at her daughter's quinceañera?

61
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:24,413
Release it, please, I'm begging you.

62
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:28,000
A plumb gig at Fox
and this shithole in my rear-view?

63
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:29,043
Sounds dreamy.

64
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,213
Okay, what if we got hard proof?
A witness? Anything?

65
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,548
[Bob] If you could get
Jesus Christ himself,

66
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:37,676
or maybe Homelander
in front of a camera, sure.

67
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:39,762
I really am sorry.

68
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:43,516
[dogs barking]

69
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:18,509
[Donna] I'm nervous about driving
in the city.

70
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,594
You'll be okay. The plan again?

71
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:25,224
Okay, drive straight to Gen's in Sedona.
Cash for gasoline, no hotels.

72
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:29,603
- I don't wanna leave you here.
- I'll be fine.

73
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,652
The anxious boy? Really?
With the moist handshake?

74
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,196
- Mom! God.
- Okay. All right, okay.

75
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,114
Um.

76
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,074
You need a new one.

77
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:44,368
I...

78
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,705
I'm not gonna wear it.

79
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:51,500
I don't care if you wear it.
I just want you to have it.

80
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,214
I love you.

81
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,008
I love you too.

82
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,137
You be safe.

83
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,513
- Okay.
- Bye.

84
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:09,435
Hey.

85
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:12,021
- What's going on?
- They've lost their minds.

86
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:15,566
The RPG releases
an electromagnetic pulse on impact.

87
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,194
Should cut through
Stormfront's plasma bolts.

88
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,237
- How sure are you?
- It's a guesstimate.

89
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,947
So that's Stormfront.

90
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:25,993
And thanks to Starlight, we know
that Noir needs any fucking tree nut.

91
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,077
How about A-Train?

92
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,580
Enough epinephrine
to blow up that motherfucker's heart.

93
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,542
- Hey, we can't just kill everyone.
- That is exactly what we're gonna do.

94
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:36,420
Listen, you heard Mallory,
she said all we need is another witness.

95
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,047
Wile E. Coyote.

96
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,091
Always chases Road Runner.

97
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,802
Always with an elaborate plan.
Always fails.

98
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:46,222
I always say, why do this, Coyote?

99
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:49,850
All you need is an AR-15
and "meep-meep," no more.

100
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,812
Exactly. See? We're just gonna shoot
Road Runner in the fucking head.

101
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:57,107
That won't stop Vought.
That won't stop Compound V.

102
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,902
If you kill these Supes,
Vought will just make a thousand more.

103
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,488
- I'm gonna top those cunts too.
- [grunts]

104
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,697
Great. So that's settled.

105
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:07,618
- We're just supervillains now, huh?
- Vought attacked the country, Hughie.

106
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,911
Fuck them all.

107
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,123
What if I testify?

108
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,709
Escaped convicts
don't have a ton of credibility.

109
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:20,506
No, but maybe I know someone who does.

110
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,342
Give us the day.

111
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:25,553
Hughie.

112
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,138
See you later.

113
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:32,810
<i>...officials are still trying to determine
the perpetrator of the Capitol attack.</i>

114
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:37,439
<i>The Department of Homeland Security
has issued a crimson terror alert.</i>

115
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,900
<i>In Washington, all government buildings...</i>

116
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:42,528
- How's Noir?
- Unresponsive.

117
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:46,448
They don't think there's brain damage,
but it's hard to tell.

118
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:49,785
Noir's a vegetable.
Lamplighter's a charcoal briquette.

119
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,871
Starlight's in the breeze somewhere.
And you're, what, fine with it?

120
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:56,333
Yes, because none of that matters anymore.
Because of this.

121
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:59,712
<i>So far, no terrorist group
has claimed responsibility...</i>

122
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:04,008
- All right. So, you didn't do this.
- I wish I'd killed Vogelbaum.

123
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,927
- But, no, it wasn't me.
- Right.

124
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:09,805
And there's no supervillains
on American soil.

125
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,308
- None that we know of.
- Then that means...

126
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:15,853
It's Edgar.

127
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:20,024
Maybe. I mean, he is pretty smart,
especially for his kind.

128
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,277
<i>...Compound V to members of the military
and law enforcement...</i>

129
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,281
Hey, smile. This is good news.

130
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:30,284
Yes, there have been sacrifices,

131
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:35,164
but we are this close
to no more premieres or paparazzi.

132
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:38,667
Or screaming fans
or any of that dancing-monkey shit.

133
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,087
We have to make sure that
the right people get the doses,

134
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,131
but it is a whole new world.

135
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,301
What about the wrong people?

136
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,929
Couple of billion of them,
they're not just gonna sit there.

137
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,976
Don't worry, silly.
Frederick had a solution for everything.

138
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:06,612
Okay. There's something really important
that I've been meaning to ask you.

139
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:10,366
Last I checked, you're not 57 years old.

140
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:15,245
So, come on,
why is it always, always Billy Joel?

141
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,749
- I'm 57 on the inside.
- No, really. Please.

142
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,920
It was just the music
in my house growing up.

143
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,255
I did some somersaults
to "You May Be Right"

144
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,508
that were pretty thrilling to watch.

Butcher is right, you know.

147
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,477
We've already tried
to take Vought down the right way.

148
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,728
This isn't gonna work.

149
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:42,606
This is not gonna stop Compound V
from getting out there.

150
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,902
So it's hopeless?
Just kill them all, let God sort them out?

151
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:47,945
I mean...

152
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,700
Then why are you even helping me?

153
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,412
Why did you save me at the Tower?

154
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,414
They were gonna hurt you.

155
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,666
You could've gotten yourself killed.

156
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:05,838
I mean, after the way that I treated you,
you had every reason to give up on me.

157
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,381
So why didn't you?

158
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,929
I just... would never.

159
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,683
That's why I'm helping.

160
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,194
[Maeve sighs]

161
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:31,905
You were stupid to text.

162
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,701
Everyone's looking for you.

163
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,870
Where's Elena?

164
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:40,998
This is the guy?

165
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,167
Um...

166
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,670
I'm... Hi. Hughie.

167
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:50,007
He's even more of a twink
than in the photo.

168
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,969
I could split that shit like dry firewood.

169
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:56,472
Big fan.

170
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,807
I need to ask you something.

171
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,393
It's a lot.

172
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,440
- I need you to testify.
- Testify?

173
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,858
On the record.

174
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:13,197
Against Vought, against Homelander,
Stormfront, everything.

175
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:19,119
- And why would I do that?
- Because things are really bad, and...

176
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,331
you're our last chance.

177
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,457
Pass.

178
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,877
- Look, I get that it's dangerous.
- It's suicide.

179
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,130
- But that's not the reason.
- Well, then what is?

180
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,841
I'm tired.

181
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:38,055
We're all tired,
but they're hurting people.

182
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,724
Sooner or later,
they'll hurt someone you love.

183
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:41,683
Am I talking to you?

184
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,686
[Annie] Look...

185
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:55,113
I get that it's easier
to just disappear inside of yourself.

186
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,241
Trust me, it's all I want to do.

187
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,034
But we can't, Maeve.

188
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,495
We can't.

189
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:05,791
- This is a war now, and we...
- Shut the fuck up.

190
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,417
Christ, you...

191
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,837
Haven't I done enough for you?

192
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:16,218
Didn't I save your fucking life?

193
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,266
It doesn't matter what we do.
Nothing changes.

194
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:31,441
Nothing ever changes or gets better.

195
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,739
And I'm tired.

196
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,827
Just leave.

197
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:44,413
Go!

198
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,584
Take your fucking twink
and get the fuck out of here!

199
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,711
Okay.

200
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,005
Come on.

201
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:11,273
Monsieur Charcuterie, we need you. Now.

202
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,945
[Becca] He said he lives under a pawn shop
in East Flatbush!

203
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,823
- He has to be here! Help me.
- Let her in.

204
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:24,202
Billy. They took him.

205
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,872
- They have Ryan.
- Who's got him?

206
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,837
I appreciate you
coming all this way, Stan.

207
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:39,092
Well, I can't exactly be seen
with you at the Tower now, can I?

208
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,930
- Fresca?
- No, thank you. Awful stuff.

209
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,310
So you had a chance
to look over our proposal?

210
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,396
He publicly confessed
to a sexual assault, Alastair.

211
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,691
And we've made a substantial investment
in the Deep's rehabilitation.

212
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:58,737
Our internal research bureau
shows an impressive Q rating.

213
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,075
He's an asset to Vought
in these troubled times.

214
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:06,828
Oh, what sort of commission
is the church getting these days?

215
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,705
Forty percent? 50?

216
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:12,376
Sounds like you're open to reinstatement.
That's fantastic.

217
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,879
What about A-Train?

218
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:18,507
You do need a speedster
since Shockwave exploded.

219
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:23,095
Harder sell.
One has-been back is redemption.

220
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,888
Two is weakness.

221
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,057
Stormfront has problems with him.

222
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,643
And at the moment, I have to indulge her.

223
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,688
What's her problem with A-Train?

224
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:37,901
I understand that she was among
your grandfather's first followers,

225
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,404
back when the Collective was a start-up.

226
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,449
I can neither confirm or deny that.

227
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:45,951
[chuckles]

228
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,998
Then your internal research bureau
knows exactly

229
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,583
what Stormfront's problem is with A-Train.

230
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,920
Deep is still a win.

231
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,132
- Shall I have Business Affairs reach out?
- Please do.

232
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,508
Let me walk you out.

233
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,314
Sons of bitches.

234
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,735
Okay, yeah.

235
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,612
Voilà.

236
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,616
Jambon buerre. Simple,
but it's the ingredients, you know?

237
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,411
- Thank you.
- Diet Coke with lime, right?

238
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,330
Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,707
We've heard a lot about you.

240
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,297
I'm sorry, I wish I could say the same.

241
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,259
- Are you all close with Billy?
- Yeah.

242
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,262
I mean, sure.

243
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,015
- Why the hesitation?
- Well...

244
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,936
let's just say he ain't really close
to a lot of people. You know?

245
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,148
- Well, except you, of course.
- I'm close to him.

246
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,900
I am.

247
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:03,278
- All right, lads, give her some air, eh?
- Yeah.

248
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,157
So Ryan ain't on
any of their social media.

249
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,659
Which is good on one hand,
but it don't help us none.

250
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,787
- So you think he's in the Tower?
- Not sure.

251
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:17,084
You stay here. Rest up.
I'm gonna go do a little digging.

252
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,669
Hey, Billy.

253
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,510
I'm sorry. I have no right to ask you
to help me after what I said to you.

254
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,763
Look, don't you worry, all right?

255
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,140
I will find your son.

256
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,522
Thank you.

257
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,029
Fuck off, you lot.

258
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,537
What is it, Samantha?

259
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,790
[Samantha] <i>Mr. Edgar,
normally I wouldn't put this through,</i>

260
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,334
<i>but the man says it's life or death,
and you know him.</i>

261
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,962
- What's his name?
<i>- William Butcher.</i>

262
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,841
Hi, hi!

263
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,301
We've been having
a super fun time in here.

264
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,554
I've been googling
the names of the cats in <i>Cats.</i>

265
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:14,099
- Can you believe Ryan has never seen <i>Cats?</i>
- What happened to your hair?

266
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,184
- Nothing.
- [Homelander] Hey, buddy.

267
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:21,398
Sorry we had to leave you all alone.
Dad's work can sometimes get pretty crazy.

268
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,985
He hasn't been alone. I've been here.
I got him all these dipping sauces.

269
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,154
You didn't wanna play
<i>Vought Tournament of Heroes?</i>

270
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:31,741
- I'm the main guy.
- I was working on my states.

271
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:32,701
[Homelander] States?

272
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,912
Yeah, I write down all 50 states
as fast as I can

273
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,957
in either alphabetical order
or geographical order.

274
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,712
- You're giving yourself homework?
- Mom says that learning is a gift, so...

275
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,005
Mm. Mm.

276
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:49,926
That mom of yours, she sure does
have some cute little sayings.

277
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,514
Do you think maybe I could call her?

278
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:02,814
Hey, Ryan.

279
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,027
I get it.

280
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,113
I would feel lonely too,
if I was cooped up all day by myself

281
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,741
in this West Elm Death Star.

282
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:14,993
Mm-hm.

283
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,371
How about we take a field trip?

284
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,415
What do you say, Dad?

285
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,045
[announcer] <i>Welcome to Planet Vought.</i>

00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,005
<i>Have a super day.</i>

288
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,638
Welcome to Planet Vought.

289
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,641
Would you like to try our new
Brave Maeve Rainbow Veggie Burger?

290
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,310
Holy shit!

291
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,816
Here you go, maestro.

292
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,072
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

293
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:57,077
Hey, wait until you try
the Big Homey with bacon.

294
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,289
It's so good. And, uh...
And the Mocha Noir Shake?

295
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:04,251
It's amazing.
It won't be lumpy like your mom's.

296
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,254
- Homelander?
- Hey.

297
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:10,423
- Can I get a selfie?
- Ask the boss.

298
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,219
Kidding. Of course you can.

299
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,221
Stormfront, I love you.
Can I get a selfie?

300
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,306
Oh, sure. One at a time.

301
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,809
- Homelander! I'm a huge fan.
- Kids first.

302
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,310
Can I get a picture?

303
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,145
- All right.
- Homelander!

304
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,147
Hey.

305
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,899
[all speaking indistinctly]

306
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,368
Hey. You okay?

307
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,786
I want my mom.

308
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,831
Okay, I got you. I got you.

309
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:49,212
Thank you, everyone. Excuse me.
Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me.

310
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:52,173
Stay back, please.
Please, please, please. Just stay back.

311
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,009
Stay back. Thank you.

00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,598
- [Hughie] New bling?
- Mm-hm.

313
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,267
Donna got it for me.

314
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,312
I'm pretty sure she got it at Duane Reade.

315
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:14,279
Oh, gosh, moms.
The gift that keeps on giving. Forever.

316
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,408
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

317
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,952
Oh, no, it's fine.

318
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:24,831
No. No. I'm an asshole for bitching
about my mom when yours is...

319
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,044
My mom's not dead.

320
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:33,089
She's not? Oh, it's just
you never mentioned her, so...

321
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,258
She left when I was six.

322
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,844
Oh, wow, shit.

323
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,555
I'm really sorry.

324
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:44,434
That's where Billy Joel comes from.

325
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,938
She and I, we used to have
these dance parties.

326
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,440
She was fun.

327
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,110
She made awesome
Seven costumes for Halloween.

328
00:19:55,362 --> 00:20:00,575
And then one day,
she just left and never called again.

329
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:01,868
Not even a card.

330
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:06,206
You know, it was like some
silent alarm went off and she was, like,

331
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:10,126
"Well, fuck them, time to go."

332
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,129
No, I'm sure that that's not it.

333
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,631
What would you call it?

334
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,763
I guess that's why I always
just kind of hang in there,

335
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,390
no matter how bad it gets.

336
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:29,020
'Cause I don't want to be like her.

337
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,610
That's kind of clingy and pathetic,
isn't it?

338
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,905
No. No. It isn't.

339
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:40,949
At all.

340
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,577
What's up, shitbirds?

341
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,037
[both scream]

342
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,001
What the fuck? What the fuck?

343
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,170
- How did you find us?
- Please.

344
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,132
I can cover the boroughs in three hours.
I went looking, that's all.

345
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,218
- I'm surprised your heart can take it.
- My heart is just fine.

346
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:03,847
- Take a step closer and I'll show you.
- Hey, I saved your life, asshole.

347
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,348
Now you're coming after us?

348
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,272
We're even now, bitch.

349
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,862
Holy shit!

350
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:20,405
Is this true?

351
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,490
Everything makes more sense now,
doesn't it?

352
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:26,244
- Where did you get this?
- I didn't get it, okay? I was never here.

353
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,912
You got that shit on your own. Yeah?

354
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,706
But why are you doing this?

355
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,543
'Cause I want back in, so I need her gone.

356
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,753
Fuck that Nazi bitch.

357
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:06,451
Would you ask Mario if he could whip up
some of those Gruyère puffs?

358
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,579
Would you like an order?
They're worth the cheat day.

359
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:14,083
I assume you got a man out there,
with a clean shot?

360
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,585
More than one.

361
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,213
Then I'll skip the fucking hors d'oeuvres,
if you don't mind,

362
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,006
and we'll just cut straight to it, yeah?

363
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,968
You mentioned on the phone
that you could help with Homelander's son.

364
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:27,263
I must say, I'm not sure what you mean.

365
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:31,559
That boy is your only possible
contingency against Homelander.

366
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:37,982
Now, that contingency don't work
if they're off playing Ward and the Beav.

367
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:40,401
I can fix that.

368
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:45,740
Thank you, Alvin.

369
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,828
Homelander's a friend.
Why would I betray him?

370
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,540
Because you're a ruthless bastard.

371
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:57,502
That's hurtful.

372
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:01,047
You turned a racist piece of shite
into America's sweetheart.

373
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,924
Now, what word would you use?

374
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:14,227
Stormfront's good at making people angry.

375
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:19,482
Angry people want Compound V.
Compound V raises our stock price.

376
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:24,821
I'd have preferred V remained a secret,
but we play with the cards we're dealt.

377
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:29,325
It's not ruthless, it's prices per share.
That's all.

378
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:33,037
Maybe you should
take a look in the mirror, mate.

379
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,081
'Cause that bitch should bother you.

380
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:39,043
Of course she does, but it's not about me.

381
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:45,508
I can't lash out
like some raging, entitled maniac.

382
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,344
That's a white man's luxury.

383
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,266
So it's just business then, eh?

384
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:58,605
When, Mr. Butcher, in history
has it ever been about anything different?

385
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:05,361
And what makes you think
that you can control that racist bitch?

386
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,032
Look, I've got to get across town...

387
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,909
I can get the boy away from Homelander,
all right?

388
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:12,869
How?

389
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,413
That's my business.

390
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:20,877
When I got him, I'll call your people,

391
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,547
they zero in on this cell signal,
and come and scoop him up.

392
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:28,384
And then you do a better fucking job
hiding him this time, yeah?

393
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:31,512
You have my word.

394
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,390
I will get Rebecca and Ryan
somewhere safe.

395
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:37,810
No. Not Becca. Becca stays with me.

396
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:42,148
But that's the whole point,
that he's raised by his mother.

397
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,318
Find him a new fucking mum.
I'm taking my wife back.

398
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,694
That's the deal.

399
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:49,989
And what happens when Rebecca
shows up at my doorstep,

400
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,825
begging to be reunited with her boy?

401
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,749
You say it's the only way
you can guarantee

402
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,334
Ryan's protection from Homelander.

403
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,294
'Cause as you know,

404
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:09,384
a mother will do anything
to protect her son.

405
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,888
And you call me a ruthless bastard.

406
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,682
You tell me where he is...

407
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,268
and I'll do the rest.

408
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,537
- Where's Ryan?
- He's inside.

409
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:40,623
- He doesn't want to talk.
- So go in, anyway.

410
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:44,043
No, no, no. I've tried.
He wants to be left alone.

411
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:48,506
You are the strongest man in the world,
and you're scared of a little boy.

412
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:50,383
He's your blood.

413
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:52,301
Just talk to him.

414
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,555
Be the man I know you are.

415
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:01,936
[Ryan] New York. North Carolina.
North Dakota.

416
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:06,733
Ohio. Oklahoma. Oregon.

417
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,405
I'm sorry.

418
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:17,410
No, no, no. Buddy, don't you be sorry.
I should've known better.

419
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:25,835
There were just so many people.

420
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,295
Yeah, there was.

421
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:40,767
You know, I remember
the first time I was in a crowd.

422
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,351
Probably didn't bother you.

423
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,187
I was terrified.

424
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,983
All these people staring at me
and reaching out, trying to grab me,

425
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,735
and egging me on to use my powers.

426
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,988
I just... I felt like I was drowning.

427
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:56,699
Well, what did you do?

428
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:59,911
Well, I took off.

429
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:04,332
I flew away.

430
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:08,544
They found me 80 miles down the I-9,
crying my little eyes out.

431
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,217
You cry?

432
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,097
Yes.

433
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:27,146
But I'm a man, so not in a long while.

434
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,274
But who knows? Maybe, uh...

435
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,778
maybe next time, you'll fly away.

436
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,614
Maybe with me?

437
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:45,289
Look, I know you want me to be like you,

438
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:46,958
but, Dad, I'm not.

439
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:52,964
Son...

440
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,719
I didn't just wake up one day
and fly out the door.

441
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,597
That's not how it works. I had to learn.

442
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:06,978
Only I didn't have anyone to teach me
'cause the doctors that, um...

443
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:12,859
The people that raised me,
uh, were scared of me,

444
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,443
so they kept their distance.

445
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:18,114
And I had to figure it all out
by myself, see?

446
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,867
Well, you don't have to
go through any of that.

447
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:22,869
I'll teach you.

448
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:24,662
Really?

449
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:27,874
I love you.

450
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,022
Hey, did you find anything?

451
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:54,191
They got him in a cabin up in Rochester.

452
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,735
- What?
- I mean...

453
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,321
Becca. She's great.

454
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:02,783
We talked earlier, and she's really great.
You're really... You're great.

455
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,118
Easy, tiger.

456
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,037
How'd you get on?
I guess you got fuck all?

457
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,248
No witnesses.
But we definitely found fuck all.

458
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,959
I'm not sure
I'm using that term properly, but...

459
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:13,878
Here.

460
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,048
Fuck me.

461
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:19,967
This is a jackpot.

462
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:21,761
Well done, you two.

463
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,889
This'll do nicely.

464
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,515
All right, listen up, you lot.

465
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:30,311
Getting the kid back ain't your fight.
I ain't gonna ask you to come along.

466
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:33,856
Lick my big Black balls, Butcher.
Sorry, Becca.

467
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:39,070
You done asked us to lie, spy,
do all kinds of fucked up shit for you.

468
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:41,530
Now we finally get a chance
to do something good,

469
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:43,366
and you think we'll take a pass on that?

470
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:44,492
We're in.

471
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,536
Of course we're in.

472
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:50,498
All right.

473
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,541
Let's get a shift on.

474
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:26,283
What?
You remember the range at Fort Bragg?

475
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:28,619
I was a better shot than you.

476
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:31,872
Well, you had a bloody good teacher,
didn't you?

477
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:35,501
I like your friends. Especially Hughie.

478
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,212
He's, uh... [chuckles] He's good for you.

479
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:42,800
Look, Becca, you ain't coming with us.

480
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,970
No, bullshit. Ryan doesn't know you,
he'll never come to you.

481
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,097
It's too dangerous,
I ain't gonna lose you again.

482
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,016
He's my son and I'm coming.

483
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,445
I need you to promise me something.

484
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:06,323
I need you to promise me
that you will save him no matter what

485
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:07,867
and you will get him back to me.

486
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,497
- Yeah. Of course.
- You realise this isn't just about me.

487
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,750
He can't grow up like Homelander.

488
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:19,045
You have to think of all of the people
out there that he would...

489
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,175
Swear to me, then.

490
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:27,928
Swear to me on your brother's soul.

491
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,810
I swear to you.

492
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,980
I swear to you on Lenny's soul.

493
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:43,778
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

494
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,354
I can use your help loading the car.

495
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:28,072
What if it happens again?

496
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:31,450
When I see Stormfront...

497
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:32,451
Stormfront...

498
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:35,121
...what if I freeze?

499
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,166
"Freeze," yes?

500
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,585
Sorry, I'm still learning.

501
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:44,505
Look...

502
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,678
If there's one thing I know,

503
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:53,139
it's that you can take care of yourself.

504
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:56,767
So when the time comes...

505
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:00,312
you'll know what to do.

506
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:06,360
Let's go.

507
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:13,868
[Homelander] Keep going. You got it.

508
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,161
That's it, don't give up.

509
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:17,746
That's it, that's it. Keep going.

510
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,208
Little more, little more, you got it.

511
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,008
Hey, that's okay.
You'll get it, you'll get it.

512
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,050
Um...

513
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,514
I know what. Imagine...

514
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:40,102
Well, sometimes, it helps
to imagine someone you hate. Okay?

515
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:41,854
So try that.

516
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:47,443
But at home, when I say "hate,"
I have to put a quarter in the swear jar.

517
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,946
Well, there's no swear jar here,
so you can hate away.

518
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,657
But I don't really hate anyone.

519
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:58,037
Well, that is very sweet, Ryan.

520
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,123
But it's not something we can afford.

521
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:02,958
We're under attack.

522
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:03,876
We are?

523
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:08,214
Bad guys want to hurt us
just because of what we look like.

524
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:13,385
They want to wipe us from this Earth
just because of the colour of our skin.

525
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:16,805
Really?

526
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:19,808
It's called White Genocide.

527
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:24,480
We're gonna need people like you
to protect our kind.

528
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:26,732
Hm.

529
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:28,442
All right. So let's try again.

530
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:29,401
[phone beeping]

531
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:30,903
Go for it. Imagine...

532
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,655
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

533
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,490
What?

534
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:36,951
What?

535
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:49,046
Are you sure this'll work?

536
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,506
Don't worry, it will work.

537
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,968
This is nothing compared
to the raves I used to set up in Algiers.

538
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:55,803
Do you dance?

539
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,096
Of course I dance.

540
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:58,973
What is the point of life without dancing?

541
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:04,103
She's on the move.

542
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:12,653
I see her, Frenchie.
We gotta go now. You close?

I signed over my bank account to you.

I did everything you asked,

and when I found out that we're all just
fucking space spores, I didn't laugh.

I did everything you asked.

But if Billy Butcher
can do the right thing,

then there's got to be
some kind of higher power.

You know?

Are you sure it's safe for you

about hanging in there.

822

I've been thinking about that lately,
the hanging in there.

And I think maybe I am too clingy.

No, you're not.

Yeah, no worries. We'll, um...

We'll just be friends, then.

and told me... it would keep me safe.
