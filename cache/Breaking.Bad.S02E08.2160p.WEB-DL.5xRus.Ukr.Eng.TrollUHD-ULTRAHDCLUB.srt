1
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:20,914
Hey.

2
00:00:23,709 --> 00:00:25,210
You...

3
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:27,546
You selling?

4
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:30,465
I don't know what you're talking about.

5
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:32,759
Okay. That's cool.

6
00:00:35,262 --> 00:00:39,266
I'm just saying, you know,
if you were selling

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,977
I could maybe do with a teenth.

8
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:46,565
You're kidding, right?

9
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:49,902
Dude, I so smell bacon.

10
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,404
What? What are you talking about?

11
00:00:52,613 --> 00:00:54,281
Oh, gee, I don't know.

12
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:57,326
How about over there.
That brown van.

13
00:00:58,535 --> 00:00:59,703
That's yours, right?

14
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:01,830
What brown van?

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,207
Parked all inconspicuous.

16
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,501
It's a cop van.

17
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:09,755
Yeah, another one right over there.

18
00:01:10,589 --> 00:01:13,216
"Duke City Flowers"? Come on.

19
00:01:13,425 --> 00:01:15,469
Can't you at least be original?

20
00:01:15,677 --> 00:01:18,096
Dude, I just wanna get high.

21
00:01:18,305 --> 00:01:20,515
A flower van.

22
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:23,852
You know what you should do
is a garbage truck.

23
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:26,146
Seriously, and I don't mean
to disrespect,

24
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,940
but if you put cops
in the back of a garbage truck

25
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:31,124
there's no way I'm seriously thinking

26
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:34,613
that there's cops
in the back of a garbage truck.

27
00:01:35,113 --> 00:01:37,449
It's a freebie, yo. Just think about it.

28
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:39,826
Think about it, boys.

29
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:43,872
All right. I'm hitting it.

30
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:46,541
You dudes give up that easy?

31
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,752
I'm not a cop.

32
00:01:49,336 --> 00:01:52,923
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.

33
00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:56,176
All right, you know what?

34
00:01:56,385 --> 00:01:59,179
Just to show you you're being an asshole.

35
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:01,473
I'm blinded by white.

36
00:02:01,682 --> 00:02:02,683
Douchebag.

37
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:05,394
Come on. I was joking. Come on.

38
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:08,981
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down. Come on.

39
00:02:10,774 --> 00:02:12,609
I mean, what are you complaining about?

40
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:14,945
You got abs, man. Kind of.

41
00:02:15,153 --> 00:02:17,030
Whatever, dude.

42
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:19,073
I'm not even sure I wanna buy anymore.

43
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:21,827
I think you turned me off
to the whole thing.

44
00:02:22,035 --> 00:02:24,079
Come on. Don't be like that.

45
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:27,499
I just need you to prove it, you know?

46
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,209
Prove you're not a cop.

47
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:32,129
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

48
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:34,673
I don't know.

49
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:39,261
Hey, I got it. Go over there
and punch that dude right in the face.

50
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:41,221
Which dude?

51
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,681
- That dude?
- Yeah.

52
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:45,350
No way. He'd kick my ass.

53
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,853
True that.

54
00:02:49,146 --> 00:02:52,482
- This is so hard, you know?
- Yeah.

55
00:02:55,277 --> 00:02:56,820
I know.

56
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,864
It's simple.

57
00:02:59,197 --> 00:03:03,535
If you ask a cop if he's a cop,
he's, like, obligated to tell you.

58
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:05,621
It's in the Constitution.

59
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:07,956
Constitution of America?

60
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,920
So go ahead and ask.

61
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:15,422
- You a cop?
- No, no. Not like that.

62
00:03:15,631 --> 00:03:17,758
Ask it, like, official.

63
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:20,552
Are you a police officer?

64
00:03:21,094 --> 00:03:24,640
No, I am not a police officer.

65
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:27,893
Okay, then. Hundred
and seventy-five for a teenth.

66
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:30,896
The price is the price, yo.

67
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:37,027
All right.

68
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:05,389
There you go. Enjoy.

69
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:08,016
Thanks, man.

70
00:04:14,147 --> 00:04:17,109
Albuquerque Police!
You're under arrest! Get on the ground!

71
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:21,780
Get on your stomach now!
On your stomach! Get on the ground!

72
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:25,909
Hold it right there. Don't move.
Stay down.

73
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:52,019
<i>I had a good job
until my boss accused me of stealing.</i>

74
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:55,188
<i>I'd better call Saul!</i>

75
00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:01,737
<i>I was out partying,
minding my own business...</i>

76
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:06,658
<i>- You are under arrest.
- I'd better call Saul!</i>

77
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:08,660
<i>Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.</i>

78
00:05:08,869 --> 00:05:10,579
<i>Did you know that you have rights?</i>

79
00:05:10,787 --> 00:05:13,248
<i>The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.</i>

80
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:15,417
<i>I believe that until proven guilty</i>

81
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:18,795
<i>every man, woman,
and child in this country is innocent.</i>

82
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:21,089
<i>And that's why I fight for you,
Albuquerque.</i>

83
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:22,174
<i>Better call Saul.</i>

84
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:24,532
<i>Saul Goodman, attorney at law,
505-164-CALL.</i>

85
00:05:24,676 --> 00:05:27,679
<i>That's 505-164-CALL.</i>

86
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:33,060
I really need to get some furniture.

87
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:35,944
I suggest you start with a bed.

88
00:05:39,274 --> 00:05:41,818
God, I wish we could smoke in here.

89
00:05:42,027 --> 00:05:45,364
- Well, you can't.
- Yeah, no. I know.

90
00:05:45,572 --> 00:05:47,574
I'm just saying.

91
00:05:49,993 --> 00:05:51,828
Don't think I can't smell that weed.

92
00:05:52,037 --> 00:05:54,037
You better seriously hope that airs out.

93
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:56,875
My dad will keep your security deposit.

94
00:05:58,085 --> 00:06:01,380
He has a nose like a damn bloodhound.

95
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:03,215
Yeah?

96
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:07,636
Has he ever caught you?

97
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:12,474
Yeah. Many times.

98
00:06:13,684 --> 00:06:15,352
Well, listen.

99
00:06:16,103 --> 00:06:19,398
Since I already lost my deposit and all

100
00:06:19,606 --> 00:06:22,192
maybe we should light up.

101
00:06:26,113 --> 00:06:27,781
No, thanks.

102
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,991
You sure?

103
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:32,953
Well, is it cool if I burn one?

104
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:35,414
Maybe you'll change your mind.

105
00:06:39,751 --> 00:06:41,712
Do what you wanna do, I guess.

106
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,053
Hey. What'd I say?

107
00:06:50,596 --> 00:06:52,097
Nothing.

108
00:06:53,307 --> 00:06:55,267
I just have to go is all.

109
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:15,746
What's this?

110
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:18,916
My 18-month chip.

111
00:07:21,627 --> 00:07:22,628
I'm in recovery.

112
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:28,467
And, you know,
pot is like stepping stones.

113
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:35,015
Recovery? That's cool.

114
00:07:35,224 --> 00:07:36,558
Right on.

115
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:38,936
I respect that.

116
00:07:39,144 --> 00:07:41,980
You know,
I don't really burn much anymore.

117
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:45,108
It's just a sometime thing.

118
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:49,321
But no more, like, in the house.

119
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:56,119
So you wanna go grab some dinner?

120
00:07:56,328 --> 00:07:58,830
I could really go for some Chinese.

121
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,499
No, I better hit it.

122
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:03,919
We...

123
00:08:04,253 --> 00:08:05,837
We cool?

124
00:08:09,383 --> 00:08:11,033
Your satellite is on, by the way.

125
00:08:14,513 --> 00:08:16,640
That screen is badass.

126
00:08:30,946 --> 00:08:33,031
I just think it's asking a lot.

127
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,242
He knows it.

128
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,119
He's done nothing but apologise.

129
00:08:38,704 --> 00:08:40,371
Is this gonna be every weekend now?

130
00:08:40,455 --> 00:08:43,750
No. It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.

131
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:48,547
But I am earning double time,
so there's a bright side.

132
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:51,133
So when the laziest boy
in the world wakes up

133
00:08:51,341 --> 00:08:53,391
tell him he better wash those sneakers.

134
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,511
And I said bye.

135
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,055
And tell him
to let them air-dry this time.

136
00:08:57,264 --> 00:09:00,017
I don't want him
banging the hell out of my dryer.

137
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:01,852
What?

138
00:09:03,478 --> 00:09:05,689
What, you don't even get casual Saturday?

139
00:09:05,898 --> 00:09:06,982
I mean...

140
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,859
No, it's just you...

141
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:10,986
You look nice is all.

142
00:09:11,194 --> 00:09:13,594
It's work, Walt.
And everybody is gonna be there.

143
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:15,574
- Okay.
- Okay.

144
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:18,243
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?

145
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:19,870
Okay.

146
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:21,580
- Bye.
- Bye.

147
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:37,054
<i>Hi. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Jr.</i>

148
00:09:37,262 --> 00:09:39,712
<i>Please leave a message,
and we'll get back to you.</i>

149
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:44,311
<i>Skyler? Are you there?
I don't know what to do.</i>

150
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,106
<i>I... I need to talk to you. I...</i>

151
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:51,860
Hey, Marie. It's me. What's up?

152
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:01,203
Yesterday I got home and found him.

153
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,373
He didn't even tell me he was coming.

154
00:10:04,873 --> 00:10:08,293
- A man was killed?
- A Federale, right in front of him.

155
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:12,589
Three agents wounded, one lost his leg.

156
00:10:12,798 --> 00:10:16,426
It's like what you hear about
from Iraq or something.

157
00:10:16,635 --> 00:10:19,429
- The IEDs.
- Oh, Jesus.

158
00:10:19,638 --> 00:10:22,474
I had to hear about it from Steve Gomez.

159
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:25,102
Hank talked to his ASAC
for about an hour.

160
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,564
Hank could win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.

161
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:31,817
He hangs up the phone,
goes right back to bed.

162
00:10:32,025 --> 00:10:37,864
And all he keeps saying is,
"I'm fine. I'm fine. Leave me alone."

163
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:03,682
Baby, not now.

164
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:07,895
It's... It's me, Hank. Sorry.

165
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:13,692
Hey, buddy. What's...?

166
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:15,444
What's up?

167
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:19,364
I just...

168
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:21,950
Do you mind if I...?

169
00:11:22,242 --> 00:11:24,161
No. No.

170
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,040
So...

171
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:32,502
How you doing?

172
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:35,756
Oh, you know, lousy.

173
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,841
Montezuma's revenge, bigtime.

174
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,388
I mean, everything's going through me
like crap through a tinhorn.

175
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,349
Better not get too close.

176
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:48,518
Well, I'll take my chances.

177
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,530
I guess you heard about
what happened down in Juárez?

178
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:03,909
Terrible.

179
00:12:04,826 --> 00:12:07,246
What do you expect?
Bunch of freaking animals.

180
00:12:07,454 --> 00:12:09,205
<i>It's like Apocalypse Now down there.</i>

181
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:13,126
It's like Colonel Kurtz
holed up in his jungle.

182
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:18,257
And my SAC in El Paso sends me home.

183
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:22,844
Now, that's a sound leadership
decision right there, huh?

184
00:12:23,053 --> 00:12:26,139
You know, you don't put
your second most senior man

185
00:12:26,348 --> 00:12:28,558
on the trail of those motherless bastards

186
00:12:28,642 --> 00:12:31,144
you send him home. You know?

187
00:12:31,645 --> 00:12:34,295
I was, you know...
"He's out getting an evidence bag,

188
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:36,524
and so ends up without a scratch on him.

189
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:40,112
So must be something wrong
with that picture, you know."

190
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:45,617
So are you home for good then?

191
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:49,121
No, no. It's...

192
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:53,208
Playing it by ear. To be determined.

193
00:12:55,752 --> 00:12:59,548
Think you might wanna talk it through
with somebody?

194
00:12:59,756 --> 00:13:02,801
What, a shrink?
No, no, no. Can't go down that road.

195
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,721
Start going down that road,
kiss your career goodbye.

196
00:13:06,638 --> 00:13:12,603
Or Marie. Or me, if you like.

197
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:22,988
You know, I don't know
how to say this. I...

198
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,075
You know, the things I deal with

199
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:31,538
you and me don't have much of a...

200
00:13:31,747 --> 00:13:35,792
What you might call
"an experiential overlap."

201
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:46,470
What if I told you we do?

202
00:13:53,977 --> 00:13:58,440
I have spent my whole life scared.

203
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:03,612
Frightened of things that could happen

204
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,156
might happen, might not happen.

205
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:09,868
Fifty years I spent like that.

206
00:14:11,662 --> 00:14:15,207
Finding myself awake at 3 in the morning.

207
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:20,629
But you know what?

208
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,216
Ever since my diagnosis

209
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,844
I sleep just fine.

210
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,102
Okay.

211
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:41,108
And I came to realise
it's that fear that's the worst of it.

212
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:43,485
That's the real enemy.

213
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,823
So...

214
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:51,493
Get up.

215
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:54,246
Get out in the real world.

216
00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:59,626
And you kick that bastard
as hard as you can right in the teeth.

217
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,352
Do it again. Go on.

218
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:27,643
Ten thousand even, same as last time.
It's totally accurate.

219
00:15:28,196 --> 00:15:30,246
You and I,
we are gonna feed this machine.

220
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:34,077
- I want it running 24 hours a day.
- Right on.

221
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:43,086
Not yours, I take it.

222
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:50,219
We got 10, 20, 30

223
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:55,432
44, five each.

224
00:15:57,392 --> 00:16:00,771
Three pounds should be 48 each.

225
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:02,022
Who's short?

226
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:05,108
All right. Don't freak, all right?
We didn't get ripped off.

227
00:16:05,192 --> 00:16:07,277
But Badger hasn't kicked in
his full amount.

228
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:09,779
I know he was planning on pulling
an all-nighter,

229
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:11,698
so he's probably still in the sack.

230
00:16:11,782 --> 00:16:15,661
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.

231
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:18,330
Why you gotta be such a hard-on?

232
00:16:18,538 --> 00:16:21,041
You're not his pal. You're his boss.

233
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,850
This only works when
they're scared of you, remember?

234
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:26,964
Jack-off.

235
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:32,344
It's going straight to voice-mail.

236
00:16:33,303 --> 00:16:34,846
Voicemail?

237
00:16:35,764 --> 00:16:39,101
Just chill, okay? Count your money.

238
00:16:44,356 --> 00:16:45,607
<i>- Combo.
- Yo, what's up?</i>

239
00:16:45,816 --> 00:16:48,026
You seen Badger?

240
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:50,946
Don't you cover for him, bitch.

241
00:16:51,154 --> 00:16:54,304
I ask you a straight-up question,
I expect a straight-up answer.

242
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:11,300
Well?

243
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:17,639
They were too scared to tell me.

244
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:20,893
Badger got busted.

245
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:22,895
He's in jail.

246
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:01,271
<i>Honey, I'm home!</i>

247
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,690
Too slow! What's up?

248
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:05,692
Got more lives than a damn cat.

249
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:07,951
Now if I could only learn to lick myself.

250
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:12,204
What's up, guys? Good to see you.
Good to see you. Good to see you.

251
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:16,203
All right. Let's all get back to work,
for chrissake, okay?

252
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:19,665
In my office, man. Let's see
what you bozos been up to lately.

253
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:44,231
You okay?

254
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:45,941
Hanging in?

255
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,860
What's it look like?

256
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:51,529
- What's this from A.P.D.?
- Been checking with them to see

257
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:54,199
if they come across
that famous blue meth of yours.

258
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:56,743
Sure enough, last night.

259
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:59,371
Got themselves an honest-to-God dealer.

260
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,875
I was thinking of cruising over
and saying hello.

261
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,175
Maybe you'd like to go with me?

262
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,589
Yeah. Well, all right.

263
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,631
You told me to my face
you weren't a cop, man.

264
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:14,219
I feel manipulated.

265
00:19:14,428 --> 00:19:16,078
I thought we were gonna hang out.

266
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,723
We are hanging out, Badger.

267
00:19:17,931 --> 00:19:20,267
You like Badger or Brandon?

268
00:19:21,101 --> 00:19:25,564
I like people who don't, like,
abuse the Constitution.

269
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:26,940
Badger, listen.

270
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:28,901
Hey.

271
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:31,653
I'm trying to help you here, man.

272
00:19:32,196 --> 00:19:36,533
Now, if you just tell me
who your supplier is

273
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,661
I think this can end very well for you.

274
00:19:40,662 --> 00:19:43,998
What are you doing, detective, talking
to my client without me present?

275
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,125
You sneaky Pete.

276
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,794
Which is which?

277
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:50,547
What, did the academy hire you
right out of the womb?

278
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:52,424
You guys get younger every...

279
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:54,301
What'd you say to baby face?

280
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,928
Did you say anything stupid?

281
00:19:56,136 --> 00:19:58,263
By "anything stupid,"
I mean anything at all.

282
00:19:58,347 --> 00:20:00,808
Look at you.
Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter.

283
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:03,352
We'll talk about it later.
Right now, you out.

284
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,814
Ten minutes ago. Go on.
There are laws, detective.

285
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:09,315
Have your kindergarten teacher
read them to you.

286
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:13,111
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap. Go on.

287
00:20:16,657 --> 00:20:17,658
All right.

288
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:20,577
Who do we have?

289
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,496
Brandon Mayhew.

290
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:25,999
Brandon Mayhew. All right.

291
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,585
Brandon Mayhew.

292
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:34,424
- Here we go. Public masturbation.
- What?

293
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,635
I don't get it. What's the kick?
Why don't you do it at home

294
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:41,348
with a big flat-screen TV,
50 channels of pay-per-view?

295
00:20:41,557 --> 00:20:44,059
In a Starbucks. That's nice.

296
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:46,186
That ain't me, man. I...

297
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:51,150
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.

298
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:54,194
Okay. All right. I got you.
Meth. Right.

299
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:56,654
Sorry, that was a little
transpositional error.

300
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:59,366
Nothing a little Wite-Out
can't take care of.

301
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:02,494
Yeah, and felony quantity.

302
00:21:02,703 --> 00:21:04,997
- Just barely.
- Yeah, just barely.

303
00:21:05,205 --> 00:21:08,374
The cops are like butchers.
Always got their thumbs on the scales.

304
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,335
But good luck arguing that in court.

305
00:21:11,795 --> 00:21:13,345
Let me get down to brass tacks.

306
00:21:13,463 --> 00:21:15,298
I'm gonna get you a second phone call.

307
00:21:15,382 --> 00:21:17,509
You're gonna call
your mommy or your daddy,

308
00:21:17,593 --> 00:21:20,095
or your parish priest
or your Boy Scout leader,

309
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:23,307
and they're gonna
deliver me a cheque for $4650.

310
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,267
I'm gonna write that down
on the back of my business card.

311
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,896
Four-six-five-zero. Okay?

312
00:21:29,104 --> 00:21:33,233
And I need that in a cashier's cheque
or a money order, doesn't matter.

313
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:35,903
Actually, I want it in a money order.

314
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:38,864
And make it out to
"Ice Station Zebra Associates."

315
00:21:39,072 --> 00:21:41,533
That's my loan-out. It's totally legit.

316
00:21:41,742 --> 00:21:43,785
It's done just for tax purposes.

317
00:21:43,994 --> 00:21:46,544
And after that,
we can discuss Visa or MasterCard,

318
00:21:46,747 --> 00:21:50,626
but definitely not American Express,
so don't even ask. All right?

319
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:51,877
Any questions?

320
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:56,798
You're gonna get me off, right?

321
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:01,678
What do I look like, your high-school
girlfriend? Five fingers, no waiting?

322
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:05,557
That's a joke, Brandon. Lighten up.

323
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:09,561
Son, I promise you this.

324
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,898
I will give you the best criminal defence

325
00:22:13,106 --> 00:22:14,483
that money can buy.

326
00:22:16,443 --> 00:22:18,570
Yeah, but, Francesca,
I took these already.

327
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:20,489
Didn't I take these already?

328
00:22:20,697 --> 00:22:23,783
It's on your head. You're not
supposed to double up on vitamin A.

329
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:25,744
It's bad for the liver.

330
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:29,456
Okay, who's next?

331
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:31,917
Did him. I did him.

332
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,502
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.

333
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,673
What happened to my masturbator?
You got me all turned around.

334
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:39,758
Hang on. I'll get back to you.

335
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:44,721
I sense you're discussing my client.
Anything you care to share with me?

336
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,558
Sure. Your commercials?
They suck ass.

337
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,894
I've seen better acting
in an epileptic whorehouse.

338
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,979
Is that like the one your mom works at?

339
00:22:53,063 --> 00:22:55,858
Is she still offering
the two-for-one discount?

340
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:58,944
DEA, huh? For a street bust.

341
00:22:59,153 --> 00:23:02,281
Now, what would two feds
want with that little twerp?

342
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:18,338
Sooner or later, this was gonna happen.

343
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:20,883
You want your exponential growth

344
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:23,259
guys are gonna get busted.
Simple as that.

345
00:23:23,343 --> 00:23:26,293
How about we get him a real attorney?
What the hell is this?

346
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,140
This is who he hires?

347
00:23:28,348 --> 00:23:31,351
What? Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.

348
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:34,396
This is the guy I'd hire.

349
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:36,565
It's the guy you'd hire.

350
00:23:36,773 --> 00:23:38,108
Look, you remember Emilio?

351
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:41,445
Okay, this dude got Emilio off,
like, twice. Okay?

352
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:46,200
Both times, they had him
dead to rights, yo. And then, poof.

353
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:47,576
Dude is like Houdini.

354
00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:49,684
Seriously, when the going gets tough

355
00:23:49,786 --> 00:23:51,622
you don't want a criminal lawyer.

356
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,167
You want a "criminal" lawyer.

357
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,169
Know what I'm saying?

358
00:23:58,754 --> 00:24:00,881
Look, we're in good shape,
Mr. White.

359
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:03,342
Badger is way too loyal to roll.

360
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,635
Plus, he's scared shitless of me,
all right.

361
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:10,015
We pay four large. Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.

362
00:24:10,224 --> 00:24:12,100
And it's only his first dealing rap,

363
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,894
so, worst-case scenario,
you know, they plead him out.

364
00:24:14,978 --> 00:24:18,524
He does five months picking up litter
in an orange jump suit.

365
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:23,695
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.

366
00:24:23,904 --> 00:24:26,448
Well, I don't need them seeing my face.

367
00:24:26,657 --> 00:24:29,743
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.

368
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,411
Dick.

369
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,121
Fine.

370
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:36,333
We'll flip for it, all right? Call it.

371
00:24:37,918 --> 00:24:39,545
Heads.

372
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:55,727
Mayhew? Mr. Mayhew?

373
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:11,577
Mr. Mayhew.

374
00:25:11,785 --> 00:25:14,746
Nice of you to come down. Please.

375
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,206
Look at you.

376
00:25:16,623 --> 00:25:20,419
Should I call the FBI
and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?

377
00:25:20,794 --> 00:25:21,795
Joking.

378
00:25:22,004 --> 00:25:24,089
I... Please, come on.

379
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:26,091
Come on. Please.

380
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,093
Hello.

381
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,472
Saul Goodman. Please sit.

382
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:38,937
So it's a shame that we have to meet
under these circumstances.

383
00:25:43,317 --> 00:25:46,278
I believe you have something for me?

384
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:48,614
Oh, yes.

385
00:25:51,241 --> 00:25:55,579
- Mayhew. Is that Irish or English?
- Irish.

386
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,624
Faith and begorra.
A fellow potato-eater.

387
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,210
My real name is McGill.

388
00:26:01,835 --> 00:26:03,753
The Jew thing I just do for the homeboys.

389
00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:07,883
They all want a pipe-hitting member
of the tribe, so to speak.

390
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:11,345
I digress.
Good things are happening.

391
00:26:11,553 --> 00:26:15,390
Fact is, your nephew is gonna
get out in no time.

392
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,226
That's wonderful, yeah.

393
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:19,812
There's still a few details
to be ironed out,

394
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,980
but now that the DEA is involved

395
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:25,901
I think he's looking
at time served, then probation.

396
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:29,488
So leave your number with Francesca,
and we'll be in touch.

397
00:26:29,696 --> 00:26:31,323
- Excuse me, the DEA?
- Yeah.

398
00:26:31,532 --> 00:26:35,118
That's the Drug Enforcement
Administration. The feds.

399
00:26:37,871 --> 00:26:40,332
I hope that I'm not
the breaker of bad news,

400
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:44,086
but your nephew got mixed up
with some pretty nasty customers.

401
00:26:44,294 --> 00:26:45,295
I understand that.

402
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:47,338
What does that have to do with the DEA?

403
00:26:47,422 --> 00:26:49,048
They're after some mystery man

404
00:26:49,132 --> 00:26:51,718
some heavy-hitter
that goes by the name Heisenberg.

405
00:26:51,802 --> 00:26:54,221
They want this guy
like the axe wants the turkey.

406
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:56,473
Seems young Brandon may have information

407
00:26:56,557 --> 00:26:58,392
that could lead to his arrest.

408
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:00,936
Jesus, cheer up.
This is good news.

409
00:27:01,145 --> 00:27:03,813
I mean, Brandon fell head-first
into the doo-doo pile,

410
00:27:03,897 --> 00:27:05,947
and came up smelling like Paco Rabanne.

411
00:27:06,984 --> 00:27:10,195
Wait, wait. Look, I just... I think...

412
00:27:10,404 --> 00:27:15,534
I just think that we should
review our options.

413
00:27:15,742 --> 00:27:17,161
Options?

414
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,419
I'm gonna tell you what your options are.

415
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,167
You got a grand total of two.
Option A: Brandon takes the deal.

416
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,668
Option B:
Brandon goes up to the penitentiary,

417
00:27:25,752 --> 00:27:28,380
and gets his rectum
resized about yay big.

418
00:27:28,589 --> 00:27:32,217
Look, look. What about reprisals?

419
00:27:32,426 --> 00:27:34,219
I mean, if Badger...

420
00:27:34,428 --> 00:27:39,892
If Brandon informs on this Heisenberg...

421
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,060
I mean, what if, God forbid

422
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:47,065
that they decide to take revenge?

423
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:49,067
What have you been telling him?

424
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:52,696
The kid keeps spouting off about,
"If I talk, they'll kill me."

425
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:55,824
Right now, he's the only thing
holding up this deal.

426
00:27:56,783 --> 00:27:59,703
- Good.
- No, that's not good. That's terrible.

427
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:02,998
Trust me, sir, your nephew
won't last in prison two weeks.

428
00:28:03,207 --> 00:28:05,876
You let him take his chances
on the outside.

429
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,169
Maybe I can work
in some witness protection.

430
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:11,924
No, look, look.
These are vicious, desperate people.

431
00:28:12,132 --> 00:28:17,095
I've been told that
one of them killed another man

432
00:28:17,304 --> 00:28:20,766
by crushing his head with an ATM machine.

433
00:28:21,975 --> 00:28:24,436
People love to take credit
for the fun ones.

434
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:28,106
The guy who got his head smooshed
used to be a client of mine.

435
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:30,915
His wife killed him, all right?
It was open and shut.

436
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,737
Trust me, you folks have
nothing to worry about, okay?

437
00:28:33,821 --> 00:28:37,171
I'm gonna set your nephew straight,
get him singing like a canary

438
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:39,785
all's right with the world.

439
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,997
Ten thousand dollars.

440
00:28:57,678 --> 00:29:00,472
Ten thousand, cash to you.

441
00:29:01,682 --> 00:29:05,352
I'm not saying to throw the case.

442
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:10,649
Just no talking to the DEA.

443
00:29:11,692 --> 00:29:13,986
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

444
00:29:14,778 --> 00:29:16,155
Yes.

445
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,824
What's it going to be?

446
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,662
What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?

447
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,832
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?

448
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,740
Yeah. "Morally outraged," he said.

449
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:30,417
Threatened to call the police.

450
00:29:30,544 --> 00:29:35,507
<i>- Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?
- Like the Exxon Valdez.</i>

451
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,635
So, what do we do about it?

452
00:29:49,313 --> 00:29:51,463
Hey, Francesca,
how about I follow you home?

453
00:29:51,565 --> 00:29:52,608
No.

454
00:29:52,816 --> 00:29:54,485
For safety.

455
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:56,236
What?

456
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,991
God, you are killing me with that booty.

457
00:30:12,486 --> 00:30:15,031
Talk to me.
Come on, talk to me, guys, huh?

458
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:18,868
Come on, just tell me what you want.
Jesus!

459
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,204
Oh, no, no, no!

460
00:30:22,413 --> 00:30:25,333
No, it wasn't me.
It was Ignacio. He's the one.

461
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:28,294
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

462
00:30:31,172 --> 00:30:33,049
Shut up, dude.

463
00:30:33,507 --> 00:30:36,636
Shut up, all right?
Just speak English.

464
00:30:36,844 --> 00:30:39,722
Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?

465
00:30:40,264 --> 00:30:43,476
- Who?
- Oh, thank God! Oh, Christ!

466
00:30:43,684 --> 00:30:46,228
Oh, I thought...

467
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:49,398
What can I do for you gentlemen?

468
00:30:49,607 --> 00:30:52,026
Anything.
Just tell me what you need.

469
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:56,322
This afternoon, an associate of ours
offered you $10,000.

470
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,074
You should have taken it.

471
00:30:58,282 --> 00:31:01,369
Wait a minute.
This is in regards to what's-his-name?

472
00:31:01,577 --> 00:31:03,996
Badger! Brandon Mayhew.

473
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:06,707
The uncle. That was your guy?

474
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:10,794
No of fence, but I don't take bribes
from strangers, you know?

475
00:31:10,878 --> 00:31:13,214
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.

476
00:31:13,422 --> 00:31:17,843
- But I'll take your money! Sure!
- No, that offer has expired, yo.

477
00:31:18,052 --> 00:31:21,973
It was kind of low anyways.
But okay, okay, I'll take it.

478
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:24,016
Just tell me what you need, all right?

479
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,200
I'm easy. I'm gonna keep
a happy thought,

480
00:31:26,394 --> 00:31:28,744
and assume
this is just a negotiating tactic.

481
00:31:28,896 --> 00:31:31,941
All right, listen to me very carefully.

482
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:34,026
You are going to give Badger Mayhew

483
00:31:34,235 --> 00:31:37,363
the best legal representation ever.

484
00:31:37,571 --> 00:31:39,824
But no deals with the DEA.

485
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,703
All right? Badger will not identify
anyone to anybody.

486
00:31:43,911 --> 00:31:46,455
If he does, you're dead.

487
00:31:48,499 --> 00:31:50,876
Why don't you just kill Badger?

488
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:56,798
I mean, follow me, but if a mosquito
is buzzing around you,

489
00:31:56,882 --> 00:32:00,219
and it bites you on the ass,
you don't go gunning for the attorney.

490
00:32:00,303 --> 00:32:03,723
You go grab a fly swatter.
I mean, so to speak.

491
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,340
I mean, all due respect,
but do I have to spell this out for you?

492
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:11,063
- We're not killing Badger, yo!
- Then you got real problems, okay.

493
00:32:11,147 --> 00:32:13,273
Because the DEA
will come down on your boy

494
00:32:13,357 --> 00:32:15,276
like a proverbial ton of bricks.

495
00:32:15,484 --> 00:32:17,684
I don't think
I'm going out on a limb here,

496
00:32:17,778 --> 00:32:19,696
but, hey, he's not gonna like prison.

497
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:24,285
He's gonna sing like Celine Dion
regardless of what you do to me.

498
00:32:29,874 --> 00:32:31,167
Mr. Mayhew?

499
00:32:33,878 --> 00:32:37,506
I recognise your cough. Take that
mask off, you know. Get some air.

500
00:32:37,882 --> 00:32:39,383
Go on.

501
00:32:46,557 --> 00:32:48,184
- God.
- Take it easy.

502
00:32:48,392 --> 00:32:51,020
Breathe in, breathe out.

503
00:32:51,228 --> 00:32:55,107
All right. I'm gonna stand up, all right?
Because I got bad knees.

504
00:32:55,858 --> 00:32:57,693
That's better.

505
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:02,031
Okay, now listen. The three of us
are gonna work this out.

506
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:03,741
Yeah? How?

507
00:33:03,991 --> 00:33:06,891
First thing, you'll put a dollar
in my pocket, both of you.

508
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:11,788
You want attorney-client privilege,
don't you?

509
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:14,961
So that everything you say
is strictly between us.

510
00:33:16,212 --> 00:33:18,062
I mean it. Put a dollar in my pocket.

511
00:33:18,255 --> 00:33:19,882
Come on, make it official.

512
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:22,635
Come on, do it.

513
00:33:23,886 --> 00:33:26,681
That's it, come on. Just a dollar.

514
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:34,563
All right, now you, ski bum.
Come on. Give with the dollar.

515
00:33:35,231 --> 00:33:36,273
- Go on.
- Be smart.

516
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:37,942
What?

517
00:33:41,612 --> 00:33:43,530
- All I got is a five.
- I'll take a five.

518
00:33:43,614 --> 00:33:47,201
Come on, already.
Come on. Be cool.

519
00:33:49,537 --> 00:33:51,747
Okay, you're now both
officially represented

520
00:33:51,831 --> 00:33:53,531
by Saul Goodman and Associates.

521
00:33:53,624 --> 00:33:58,004
Your secrets are safe with me
under threat of disbarment. All right?

522
00:33:58,421 --> 00:34:02,071
Take the ski mask off. I feel like I'm
talking to the Weather Underground.

523
00:34:03,634 --> 00:34:05,594
Just do it.

524
00:34:10,224 --> 00:34:13,602
Okay, so if a prison shanking
is completely off the table...

525
00:34:13,811 --> 00:34:15,062
And we're sure of that?

526
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,191
No shanking!

527
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:22,695
All right, all right.

528
00:34:23,321 --> 00:34:27,742
The way I see it is
somebody is going to prison.

529
00:34:31,662 --> 00:34:33,539
It's just a matter of who.

530
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:38,252
All right. Lame-ass TV ads aside

531
00:34:38,461 --> 00:34:41,964
your lawyer here,
he cooked you up a pretty killer deal.

532
00:34:42,173 --> 00:34:43,473
Time served, no probation.

533
00:34:43,633 --> 00:34:46,969
It's pretty slick.
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.

534
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:50,264
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.

535
00:34:50,473 --> 00:34:52,641
You don't give us
the name of your supplier

536
00:34:52,725 --> 00:34:55,936
- you're going nowhere.
- The tough guy act is unnecessary.

537
00:34:56,145 --> 00:34:58,439
This young man is cooperating fully.

538
00:34:58,648 --> 00:35:01,567
Is that right?
Yeah, you cooperating?

539
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:08,407
Okay, let's start with a name.

540
00:35:10,868 --> 00:35:12,954
He just goes by Heisenberg.

541
00:35:13,496 --> 00:35:14,497
Heisenberg, huh?

542
00:35:15,873 --> 00:35:17,333
How old is this Heisenberg?

543
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:21,837
Old. Like 50 or 70 or something.

544
00:35:22,046 --> 00:35:24,173
- Height?
- Average, I guess.

545
00:35:24,382 --> 00:35:26,258
Medium height, medium weight.

546
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:29,470
- What colour hair?
- No hair.

547
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:31,305
Dude is balder than you.

548
00:35:33,516 --> 00:35:35,977
1963, James Edward Kilkelly...

549
00:35:36,185 --> 00:35:38,688
...is convicted of stealing
a vending machine.

550
00:35:38,896 --> 00:35:41,691
1975, breaking and entering.

551
00:35:41,899 --> 00:35:44,527
1982, grand theft auto.

552
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:47,071
1984, armed robbery.

553
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,617
1987, 1992. You get the idea.
And here he is today.

554
00:35:51,826 --> 00:35:53,703
Better known as Jimmy In-'N-Out.

555
00:35:53,911 --> 00:35:59,417
City, state and federal, he's spent
44 of the last 58 years inside.

556
00:36:00,418 --> 00:36:02,878
Entire life behind bars.

557
00:36:03,379 --> 00:36:05,631
Jimmy provides a very special service.

558
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,676
For a price,
Jimmy will go to prison for you.

559
00:36:09,677 --> 00:36:13,389
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?

560
00:36:14,307 --> 00:36:16,225
He's actually more comfortable inside.

561
00:36:16,434 --> 00:36:18,853
The outside world
hasn't been too kind to him.

562
00:36:20,896 --> 00:36:23,023
Sometime during
the Clinton administration

563
00:36:23,107 --> 00:36:27,236
Jimmy figured out how he could
use his talents to turn a profit.

564
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:36,537
- So when does all this happen?
- It's already happening.

565
00:36:36,746 --> 00:36:38,146
The buy is set for tomorrow.

566
00:36:38,247 --> 00:36:40,916
Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out,
everybody's happy,

567
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:44,175
and all it's gonna cost you
is 80 thousand and one pound

568
00:36:44,337 --> 00:36:45,838
of your finest meth.

569
00:36:50,468 --> 00:36:54,305
Eighty thousand dollars
for eight years of his life, huh?

570
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:56,724
First of all,
he's not gonna do eight years.

571
00:36:56,932 --> 00:36:58,832
I'll represent him, and I guarantee

572
00:36:58,934 --> 00:37:02,534
there's gonna be some unexpected
problems with the prosecution's case.

573
00:37:02,647 --> 00:37:05,274
Secondly, he gets 30.
Fifty goes to me.

574
00:37:05,483 --> 00:37:08,527
- You get 50? For what?
- For facilitating.

575
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,405
Who's taking a bigger risk here?
He likes prison.

576
00:37:11,614 --> 00:37:13,616
You did bring the cash, didn't you?

577
00:37:13,824 --> 00:37:16,911
Look, if this option is too expensive

578
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,539
you can still always... Badger
in the chow line.

579
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:40,935
Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?

580
00:37:57,019 --> 00:37:59,521
All right. There's our boy.

581
00:38:00,689 --> 00:38:02,983
Right on time.

582
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:22,670
- Go back.
- What? All right, all right, all right.

583
00:38:35,557 --> 00:38:39,186
So, what do you think?
They see us?

584
00:38:39,603 --> 00:38:41,480
No, man, I think we're good.

585
00:38:46,902 --> 00:38:48,988
Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.

586
00:38:49,405 --> 00:38:50,864
Give me those back.

587
00:38:51,073 --> 00:38:53,033
Just give them to me.

588
00:38:53,701 --> 00:38:55,494
Oh, no.

589
00:38:56,078 --> 00:38:57,288
Where the hell is Jimmy?

590
00:38:57,496 --> 00:38:59,498
Should've been here 10 minutes ago.

591
00:38:59,707 --> 00:39:04,420
You think Jimmy is actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?

592
00:39:05,004 --> 00:39:07,006
There's more than one kind of prison.

593
00:39:07,214 --> 00:39:09,164
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

594
00:39:09,258 --> 00:39:11,719
There he is... Wait a minute.

595
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:15,472
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What? What? Let me see.

596
00:39:17,016 --> 00:39:19,226
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know.

597
00:39:22,938 --> 00:39:25,899
Mr. Heisenberg, I presume.

598
00:39:26,942 --> 00:39:28,611
Time to move?

599
00:39:28,902 --> 00:39:30,946
Not till we see the exchange.

600
00:39:33,782 --> 00:39:36,785
No, no. Oh, shit!

601
00:39:36,994 --> 00:39:40,080
- What?
- Now he shows.

602
00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:45,502
Okay, let's do this.

603
00:39:49,673 --> 00:39:51,008
No, no.

604
00:39:51,216 --> 00:39:53,761
Oh, my God.
Jimmy is on the wrong bench. Crap!

605
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:56,055
We're screwed!

606
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:57,640
What are you doing?

607
00:39:57,848 --> 00:39:59,975
Hey, what are you doing?

608
00:40:04,063 --> 00:40:05,940
I don't get it. What's the holdup?

609
00:40:16,659 --> 00:40:17,952
Where's the stuff, man?

610
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,287
- Where are we going?
- Just shut up.

611
00:40:26,168 --> 00:40:27,378
Get out. Go stop him.

612
00:40:27,586 --> 00:40:30,130
The DEA is right there.
If they see me, we're screwed.

613
00:40:30,214 --> 00:40:31,715
Get out. I'll do something.

614
00:40:31,924 --> 00:40:33,926
- What?
- Just go!

615
00:40:46,855 --> 00:40:48,983
Hank, I thought that was you.

616
00:40:49,191 --> 00:40:50,776
Schrader, I'm blocked.

617
00:40:50,985 --> 00:40:53,862
- Walt, not a good time.
- How you doing? You feeling okay?

618
00:40:53,946 --> 00:40:55,046
Schrader, I'm blocked.

619
00:40:55,656 --> 00:40:57,658
We're working.
You gotta get out of here.

620
00:40:57,866 --> 00:41:01,328
- Working? Oh, like DEA working?
- Schrader, we're missing it. Schrader.

621
00:41:01,412 --> 00:41:03,455
Is something going down?

622
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:08,252
Wrong guy, wrong guy.
Other bench.

623
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,176
Walt, Walt.

624
00:41:16,385 --> 00:41:18,512
- Walter, move your ass now.
- Okay.

625
00:41:18,721 --> 00:41:20,621
Listen, I'll just go, leave you alone.

626
00:41:20,723 --> 00:41:23,642
- We'll talk about it later. Just floor it.
- Should I back up?

627
00:41:23,726 --> 00:41:25,268
- Go that way.
- Forward is better?

628
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:27,312
I'll be out of the way there.
Okay, okay.

629
00:41:27,396 --> 00:41:29,857
I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.

630
00:41:30,065 --> 00:41:32,651
- I'll leave you alone.
- We'll talk later. Just go.

631
00:41:33,402 --> 00:41:36,280
Where'd he go?
Where the hell did he go?

632
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,493
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Got him.

633
00:41:48,751 --> 00:41:51,128
- Looks like it's going down.
- Take him.

634
00:41:59,136 --> 00:42:02,139
Freeze! Hey, right there.
Don't move.

635
00:42:04,558 --> 00:42:05,976
Come on, let's get him up.

636
00:42:15,778 --> 00:42:17,446
Jesus!

637
00:42:18,447 --> 00:42:20,282
I think they bought it.

638
00:42:24,036 --> 00:42:25,079
<i>Absolutely.</i>

639
00:42:25,287 --> 00:42:28,666
Textbook bust, sir. Yes, sir.

640
00:42:28,874 --> 00:42:31,418
Looks like we got a full pound
of the blue stuff.

641
00:42:31,627 --> 00:42:36,382
Oh, and Heisenberg's real name?
James Kilkelly.

642
00:42:37,675 --> 00:42:41,762
Thank you. Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.

643
00:43:08,497 --> 00:43:09,832
Hey.

644
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:13,335
You weren't home,
so I let the delivery guys in.

645
00:43:13,544 --> 00:43:16,964
- I hope that's okay.
- Absolutely.

646
00:43:26,348 --> 00:43:28,517
So you bought a bed.

647
00:43:29,977 --> 00:43:31,103
Yeah.

648
00:43:31,687 --> 00:43:33,397
What is that, a king?

649
00:43:35,899 --> 00:43:37,484
Pillow top?

650
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:17,608
Oh, my God.
You really are a chemistry teacher.

651
00:44:22,571 --> 00:44:24,073
You mind?

652
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,371
I was terrible at chemistry.

653
00:44:30,579 --> 00:44:33,207
I'm more of a humanities guy.

654
00:44:33,415 --> 00:44:36,001
- How did you find me?
- We should talk about that.

655
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:40,547
It should be much, much harder
for people to track you down.

656
00:44:40,756 --> 00:44:42,506
My Pl charged me for three hours,

657
00:44:42,591 --> 00:44:45,552
so I seriously doubt
it took him more than one.

658
00:44:48,472 --> 00:44:51,600
So this is, what, blackmail?

659
00:44:51,809 --> 00:44:53,519
Walter, I'm your lawyer.

660
00:44:53,727 --> 00:44:58,148
Anything you say to me
is totally privileged.

661
00:44:58,357 --> 00:45:00,901
I'm not in the shakedown racket.

662
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:03,653
I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers
need lawyers, right?

663
00:45:03,737 --> 00:45:06,865
Especially drug dealers.

664
00:45:07,283 --> 00:45:11,328
So, what, you're just doing this
out of the kindness of your heart?

665
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:15,165
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?

666
00:45:16,458 --> 00:45:18,458
By the way, where do you keep the money?

667
00:45:18,627 --> 00:45:22,923
Is it in your mattress? Is it in a
jelly jar buried in the side yard?

668
00:45:23,132 --> 00:45:26,218
This kid Mayhew may be the first
of your guys to get picked up,

669
00:45:26,302 --> 00:45:27,702
but he won't be the last.

670
00:45:27,803 --> 00:45:31,348
And if I can find you,
how far behind can the cops be?

671
00:45:31,557 --> 00:45:32,975
I don't understand.

672
00:45:33,183 --> 00:45:36,061
What exactly are you
offering to do for me?

673
00:45:37,563 --> 00:45:40,608
What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone?

674
00:45:41,025 --> 00:45:44,111
I'm no Vito Corleone.

675
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,072
No shit. Right now, you're Fredo.

676
00:45:47,281 --> 00:45:48,782
But with some sound advice,

677
00:45:48,991 --> 00:45:51,368
and the proper introductions, who knows?

678
00:45:51,577 --> 00:45:53,662
I'll tell you,
you've got the right product.

679
00:45:53,746 --> 00:45:56,623
Anything that gets the DEA's panties
in this big a bunch

680
00:45:56,707 --> 00:45:58,407
you're on to something special.

681
00:45:58,584 --> 00:46:02,963
And I would like to be
a small and silent part of it.

682
00:46:05,549 --> 00:46:06,699
Food for thought, yeah?

683
00:46:11,805 --> 00:46:16,477
So if you wanna make more money
and keep the money that you make

684
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,813
better call Saul!
