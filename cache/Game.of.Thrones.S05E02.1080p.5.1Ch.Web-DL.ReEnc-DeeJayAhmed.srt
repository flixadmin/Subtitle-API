00:14:00,788 --> 00:14:03,155
Wary of strangers, as she should be.

171
00:14:03,228 --> 00:14:05,595
I saw her riding on the East Road
with Littlefinger.

172
00:14:05,668 --> 00:14:06,715
We'll follow them.

173
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:11,357
My lady,
If both Stark girls refused your service,

174
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:12,953
maybe you're released from your vow.

175
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:15,316
I swore to their mother
I would protect those girls.

176
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,389
But if they don't want your protection...

177
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:18,675
Do you think she's safe with Littlefinger?

178
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:22,958
No, my lady.

179
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,757
Get your horse.

180
00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:31,549

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

182
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:36,116
A summons from the queen.

183
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:56,395
CERSEI: There are only
two like it in the world.

184
00:14:57,308 --> 00:14:59,834
The one I'm wearing,
the one I gave to Myrcella.

185
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:02,639
- It's a threat.
- Of course it's a threat.

186
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:08,878
Our daughter's alone in Dorne
surrounded by people who hate our family.

187
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:11,110
"It's a threat."

188
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:13,709
No note?

189
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,837
They blame us for the death
of Oberyn and his sister

190
00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:20,071
and every other tragedy
that's befallen their cursed country.

191
00:15:20,148 --> 00:15:22,628
I will burn their cities to the ground
if they touch her.

192
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,517
- Softer.
- What?

193
00:15:24,588 --> 00:15:25,589
Not so loud.

194
00:15:25,668 --> 00:15:28,512
Our daughter's in danger
and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly?

195
00:15:28,588 --> 00:15:30,875
The world can't know she's our daughter.

196
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:34,555
Then don't call her your daughter.

197
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:36,158
You've never been a father to her.

198
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,708
If I was a father to any of my children,
they'd be stoned in the street.

199
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:40,830
And what has your caution brought?

200
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:45,352
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding.

201
00:15:45,468 --> 00:15:47,835
Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne.

202
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:53,392
Our baby boy set to marry
that smirking whore from Highgarden.

203
00:16:02,468 --> 00:16:03,549
I'm going to make things better.

204
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:05,118
You've never made anything better.

205
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:08,670
I'm going to Dorne
and I'm bringing our daughter home.

(SCOFFS)

207
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:13,589
You can't just ask Prince Doran
to give her back.

208
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:15,033
She's promised to his son.

209
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:18,034
I'm not going to ask him anything.

210
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:20,110
You go down there with an army,
it's an act of war.

211
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,917
No army.

212
00:16:21,988 --> 00:16:23,149
Do you know where they're keeping her?

213
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:30,032
- Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
- I'll find her.

214
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,551
Is there anything else, Your Grace?

215
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:38,755
(CHUCKLES)

216
00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:40,432
You're going to Dorne?

217
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:44,995
A one-handed man, alone.

218
00:16:46,228 --> 00:16:48,230
I never said I was going alone.

219
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,993
No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.

220
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:01,230
Roses are very nice. Definitely roses.

221
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:04,994
And music. I adore music.
But no flutes. I hate flutes.

222
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:07,116
We can have a harp if you
like, but no flutes.

223
00:17:07,188 --> 00:17:09,509
Then there's the food.
Food is the most important thing.

224
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:12,159
Don't you agree?
We're going to need pigeon pies.

225
00:17:12,228 --> 00:17:14,435
That's what they eat in
the capital, don't they?

226
00:17:16,028 --> 00:17:17,632
Don't they?

227
00:17:18,908 --> 00:17:19,955
Don't who?

228
00:17:20,028 --> 00:17:22,998
People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

229
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:27,157
They certainly do, my dear.

230
00:17:28,508 --> 00:17:30,749
It's a fine place, isn't it?

231
00:17:30,828 --> 00:17:32,273
A fine place.

232
00:17:33,028 --> 00:17:36,919
I never thought I'd end up
settling down in a place like this.

233
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:38,594
You won't.

234
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:40,669
Pardon?

235
00:17:40,748 --> 00:17:42,716
We won't get to live at Stokeworth.

236
00:17:42,788 --> 00:17:46,076
When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle
because she's older.

237
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,559
She hates me.

238
00:17:47,628 --> 00:17:49,949
She calls me mean names,
and sometimes, even still,

239
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,918
she pulls my hair when
Mother's not looking.

240
00:17:54,468 --> 00:17:56,470
You know what I think?

241
00:17:56,548 --> 00:17:58,676
I think you're a good person.

242
00:17:58,748 --> 00:18:00,750
And your sister is a mean person.

243
00:18:00,828 --> 00:18:02,318
She is.

244
00:18:04,388 --> 00:18:06,231
I've been all over the world,

245
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:08,356
and if there's one thing I've learned,

246
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:10,590
it's that meanness comes around.

247
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,437
People like your sister,

248
00:18:13,508 --> 00:18:16,990
they always get
what's coming to them eventually.

249
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:19,036
One way or another.

250
00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:23,832
Who's that?

251
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,790
Jaime fucking Lannister.

252
00:18:30,548 --> 00:18:33,438
- Ser Jaime.
- Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

253
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:37,108
I was very sorry to hear about your father.

254
00:18:37,188 --> 00:18:38,633
Thank you.

255
00:18:38,988 --> 00:18:41,753
This is my betrothed, Lollys.

256
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:44,514
A pleasure.

257
00:18:47,348 --> 00:18:49,032
Run along, love.

258
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:57,430
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.

259
00:18:58,028 --> 00:18:59,632
When were you planning on getting married?

260
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,029
- Just get on with it.
- On with what?

261
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,598
What you're here for.

262
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,598
There's no way this little visit could
possibly mean anything good for me.

263
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:08,712
It's very good for you.

264
00:19:20,788 --> 00:19:23,871
- Lollys will be marrying Ser Willis Bracken.
- Mmm.

265
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:27,269
We made a deal, your sister and I.

266
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,869
I would have advised against that.

267
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:30,389
How is this good for me?

268
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:33,597
'Cause you're going to come with me
and help me with something important.

269
00:19:33,668 --> 00:19:35,113
And when we return,

270
00:19:35,188 --> 00:19:38,715
I'm going to give you a much better girl
and a much better castle.

271
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,910
Return from where?

272
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:46,190
As far south as south goes.

273
00:19:59,588 --> 00:20:01,590
TRYSTANE: My future queen.

274
00:20:03,588 --> 00:20:05,431
(SPEAKING SOFTLY)

275
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,351
You are beautiful.

276
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,396
The prince does not wish to be disturbed.

277
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:27,316
Remove yourself from my path or I'll take
that long ax and I'll shove it up your...

278
00:20:27,388 --> 00:20:28,958
DORAN: Captain.

279
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:32,635
Let her pass.

280
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:38,435
Your brother was murdered,

281
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:42,957
and you sit here in the Water Gardens,
staring at the sky and doing nothing.

282
00:20:43,028 --> 00:20:47,238
Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat.
By law, that is not murder.

283
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:49,709
- Your brother.
- You don't have to remind me.

284
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:52,632
He was my brother
long before he was anything to you.

285
00:20:53,428 --> 00:20:54,634
What will you do about his death?

286
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,234
I will bury him. I will mourn for him.

287
00:20:57,308 --> 00:20:58,355
And then?

288
00:20:58,468 --> 00:20:59,913
You would have me go to war?

289
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:01,353
The whole country would have you go to war.

290
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,272
Then we are lucky
the whole country does not decide.

291
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:08,512
The Sand Snakes are with me.

292
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,278
They have the love of their people.

293
00:21:10,348 --> 00:21:16,071
They will avenge their father while
you sit here in your chair doing nothing.

294
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:21,319
Oberyn is dead,

295
00:21:22,428 --> 00:21:25,193
and this Lannister girl
skips about the Water Gardens,

296
00:21:25,388 --> 00:21:29,074
eating our food, breathing our air.

297
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:32,274
How many of your brothers and sisters
do they have to kill?

298
00:21:33,948 --> 00:21:35,393
Let me have her.

299
00:21:37,348 --> 00:21:40,955
Let me send her to Cersei
one finger at a time.

300
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,750
I loved my brother.

301
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:47,030
And you made him very happy.

302
00:21:47,268 --> 00:21:50,238
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

303
00:21:51,348 --> 00:21:54,716
But we do not mutilate little girls
for vengeance.

304
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,073
Not here.

305
00:21:57,388 --> 00:21:58,799
Not while I rule.

306
00:22:00,348 --> 00:22:02,271
And how long will that be?

DAARIO: The Unsullied are too conspicuous.

308
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:23,918
Anyone can see you coming from a mile off.

309
00:22:23,988 --> 00:22:25,911
Of course you haven't found
any Sons of the Harpy.

310
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:28,391
You haven't, have you?

My Second Sons, on the other hand,

00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:35,959
they drink, whore,

314
00:22:36,028 --> 00:22:37,837
fight in the streets,

315
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:39,319
they blend in.

316
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:41,789
They overhear things in taverns,

317
00:22:41,868 --> 00:22:45,554
follow people to nice, quiet alleys,

318
00:22:45,628 --> 00:22:47,676
break a few fingers,

319
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:49,477
overhear a few more things.

320
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:52,752
Before you know it...

321
00:23:12,228 --> 00:23:13,229
No one here.

322
00:23:14,468 --> 00:23:15,913
We go.

323
00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:18,753
In a hurry? You're afraid?

324
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:20,796
Unsullied fear nothing.

325
00:23:21,788 --> 00:23:23,313
Right.

326
00:23:23,428 --> 00:23:24,759
That's your problem.

327
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:28,799
You understood fear once long ago,
but you've forgotten what it means.

328
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,154
Someone who's forgotten fear

329
00:23:32,668 --> 00:23:34,238
has forgotten how to hide.

Fear is useful that way.

(SCREAMS)

334
00:24:09,788 --> 00:24:12,951
Sons of the Harpy,
they want to put a collar back on my neck.

335
00:24:13,628 --> 00:24:16,711
On all of our necks.
Please, Your Grace, you must kill him.

336
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,074
It would send a message.

337
00:24:18,388 --> 00:24:20,789
I think you should exercise restraint,
Your Grace.

338
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:21,915
Why?

339
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:23,712
For one thing,
he may have valuable information.

340
00:24:23,788 --> 00:24:26,678
The Son of the Harpy
has no more valuable information.

341
00:24:26,828 --> 00:24:28,068
How do you know that?

342
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:30,071
Because I questioned him.

343
00:24:30,508 --> 00:24:32,670
HIZDAHR: And the information you did get,
he is young and poor.

344
00:24:32,788 --> 00:24:33,789
He is born free.

345
00:24:33,868 --> 00:24:36,109
Why should he want to bring back slavery?
What did it do for him?

346
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:37,553
Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride

347
00:24:37,668 --> 00:24:39,477
was knowing that
there was someone lower than he was.

348
00:24:39,548 --> 00:24:40,595
They pay him.

349
00:24:40,908 --> 00:24:42,751
Great families afraid to do a thing.

350
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,559
They pay poor men to do it for them.

351
00:24:44,628 --> 00:24:46,471
- And how do you know this?
- Everyone know this.

352
00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:48,596
I don't know it,
and I'm the head of a great family.

353
00:24:48,668 --> 00:24:50,989
BARRISTAN: We do not know
what this man did or didn't do.

354
00:24:51,068 --> 00:24:54,629
Give him a trial at least. A fair trial.

355
00:24:55,548 --> 00:24:56,913
Show all the citizens of Meereen

356
00:24:56,988 --> 00:24:59,389
that you're better than
those who would depose you.

357
00:24:59,468 --> 00:25:00,549
Teach them a better way.

358
00:25:00,788 --> 00:25:03,075
I do not know the place
from where Old Ser comes.

359
00:25:03,308 --> 00:25:06,551
Things maybe are different there, I hope.

360
00:25:06,628 --> 00:25:08,630
But here in Meereen,

361
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,632
before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us.

362
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:14,029
So we learn much about them,

363
00:25:14,108 --> 00:25:16,236
or we do not live long.

364
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:18,436
They teach me what they are.

365
00:25:18,748 --> 00:25:22,753
Mercy, fair trial, these
mean nothing to them.

366
00:25:22,828 --> 00:25:25,069
All they understand is blood.

367
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,390
DAENERYS: Thank you all for your counsel.

368
00:25:40,948 --> 00:25:43,349
Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you.

369
00:25:43,468 --> 00:25:46,119
- About what?
- About your father.

370
00:25:46,188 --> 00:25:48,156
- About the Mad King.
- The Mad King?

371
00:25:48,228 --> 00:25:49,753
You're here to remind
me of my enemies' lies?

372
00:25:49,988 --> 00:25:51,114
Consider me reminded.

373
00:25:51,188 --> 00:25:53,077
Your Grace,

374
00:25:53,148 --> 00:25:55,628
I served in his Kingsguard.

375
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,233
I was at his side from the first.

376
00:25:57,588 --> 00:25:59,750
Your enemies did not lie.

377
00:26:01,548 --> 00:26:02,879
Go on.

378
00:26:04,748 --> 00:26:07,433
When the people rose in revolt against him,

379
00:26:07,588 --> 00:26:11,035
your father set their
towns and castles aflame.

380
00:26:11,108 --> 00:26:14,430
He murdered sons in front of their fathers.

381
00:26:14,508 --> 00:26:16,829
He burned men alive with wildfire

382
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,637
and laughed as they screamed.

383
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:23,270
And his efforts to stamp out dissent

384
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:27,672
led to rebellion
that killed every Targaryen except two.

385
00:26:28,868 --> 00:26:30,313
I'm not my father.

386
00:26:30,468 --> 00:26:33,153
No, Your Grace. Thank the gods.

387
00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:38,158
But the Mad King gave his enemies
the justice he thought they deserved.

388
00:26:38,228 --> 00:26:42,028
And each time,
it made him feel powerful and right.

389
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,679
Until the very end.

390
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:53,508
I will not have the Son of the Harpy
executed without a fair trial.

391
00:26:57,108 --> 00:26:59,110

393
00:27:08,388 --> 00:27:09,674
There's a bug.

394
00:27:09,748 --> 00:27:11,238
Yes, best be careful.

395
00:27:11,308 --> 00:27:14,118
You might accidentally
consume some solid food.

396
00:27:14,188 --> 00:27:18,989
When I agreed to come with you,
did I misrepresent my intentions?

397
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:24,394
Besides,

398
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:28,110
what else is there for me to do
inside this fucking box?

399
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,235
You don't like it?

400
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:31,356
- I want to take a walk.
- You can't.

401
00:27:31,548 --> 00:27:35,075
Cersei has offered a lordship
to the man who brings her your head.

402
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:37,116
She ought to offer her cunt.

403
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:39,395
Best part of her for the best part of me.

404
00:27:40,228 --> 00:27:44,119
Well, I suppose a box
is as good a place for me as anywhere.

405
00:27:44,228 --> 00:27:46,834
Are we really going to
spend the entire road to Volantis

406
00:27:46,908 --> 00:27:48,910
talking about the futility of everything?

407
00:27:48,988 --> 00:27:50,194
You're right. No point.

408
00:27:51,268 --> 00:27:53,111
The road to Volantis?

409
00:27:53,268 --> 00:27:56,158
You said we were going to Meereen.
What's in Volantis?

410
00:27:56,228 --> 00:27:57,639
The road to Meereen.

411
00:27:57,708 --> 00:28:01,190
And what do you hope to find
at the end of the road to Meereen?

412
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,470
I told you. A ruler.

413
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:04,834
We've already got a ruler.

414
00:28:05,788 --> 00:28:08,359
Everywhere has already got a ruler.

415
00:28:08,428 --> 00:28:12,752
Every pile of shit on the side of every
road has someones banner hanging from it.

416
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:17,079
You were quite good, you know, at ruling.

417
00:28:17,508 --> 00:28:19,112
During your brief tenure as Hand.

418
00:28:20,188 --> 00:28:21,713
I didn't rule. I was a servant.

419
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:24,155
Still, a man of talent.

420
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:25,713
Managed to kill a lot of people.

421
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:29,759
Yes, but you showed great promise
in other areas as well.

422
00:28:33,148 --> 00:28:36,038
She wanted me to leave King's Landing.

423
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:38,237
She begged me.

424
00:28:38,308 --> 00:28:39,469
I wouldn't go.

425
00:28:39,948 --> 00:28:41,109
Why?

426
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:42,678
'Cause I liked it.

427
00:28:43,628 --> 00:28:45,357
Power.

428
00:28:45,428 --> 00:28:47,510
Even as a servant.

429
00:28:47,588 --> 00:28:49,670
People follow leaders.

430
00:28:50,588 --> 00:28:54,149
And they will never follow us.
They find us repulsive.

431
00:28:54,268 --> 00:28:55,554
I find us repulsive.

432
00:28:55,628 --> 00:28:57,551
And we find them repulsive,

433
00:28:57,628 --> 00:29:00,916
which is why we surround ourselves
with large, comfortable boxes

434
00:29:00,988 --> 00:29:02,114
to keep them away.

435
00:29:03,148 --> 00:29:05,116
And yet,

436
00:29:05,188 --> 00:29:07,395
no matter what we do,

437
00:29:07,468 --> 00:29:11,871
people like you and me
are never really satisfied inside the box.

438
00:29:11,948 --> 00:29:13,552
Not for long.

439
00:29:14,748 --> 00:29:16,557
You're right.

440
00:29:16,628 --> 00:29:18,949
- Let's go for a walk.
- No.

441
00:29:19,028 --> 00:29:22,237
How many dwarves are there in the world?

442
00:29:22,308 --> 00:29:24,993
Is Cersei going to kill them all?

444
00:29:28,948 --> 00:29:30,473
Not him.

445
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,477
Are you trying to deceive your queen?

446
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:35,229
Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?

447
00:29:35,308 --> 00:29:36,434
That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn.

448
00:29:36,948 --> 00:29:39,838
I don't want to dissuade the other hunters.

449
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:41,433
Mistakes will be made.

450
00:29:41,508 --> 00:29:43,237
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Thank you, Your Grace.

451
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,952
- Take the head.
- Pardon me, Your Grace.

452
00:29:45,028 --> 00:29:47,030
I would take it, if you don't mind.

453
00:29:47,108 --> 00:29:49,349
It could prove useful for my work.

454
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,389
Very good.

455
00:29:54,748 --> 00:29:56,876
Over there will be fine.

456
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,188
You heard the man. Over there.

You're the Hand of the King?

00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:30,918
No, Unde.

460
00:30:30,988 --> 00:30:34,674
Clearly it would not be appropriate
for a woman to assume that role.

461
00:30:34,748 --> 00:30:36,796
I'm merely advising my son
until he comes of age

462
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:38,472
and chooses a Hand for himself.

463
00:30:38,988 --> 00:30:41,992
Your Grace,
I would be willing to serve provisionally

464
00:30:42,068 --> 00:30:44,230
as the King's Hand
until he becomes old enough...

465
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:45,753
You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,

466
00:30:45,868 --> 00:30:47,233
but I don't imagine you'll have the time.

467
00:30:47,948 --> 00:30:50,155
In addition to being Master of Ships,

468
00:30:50,228 --> 00:30:52,959
the king has appointed you Master of Coin.

469
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:55,595
Oh, Your Grace.

470
00:30:55,668 --> 00:30:59,070
He called your experience and wisdom
in financial matters unparalleled.

471
00:30:59,868 --> 00:31:03,839
He said he would be honored to have you
represent the crown's interests in the same.

472
00:31:03,908 --> 00:31:05,910
The honor is all mine, Your Grace.

473
00:31:06,188 --> 00:31:09,271
Your Grace, in the past
on several occasions,

474
00:31:09,348 --> 00:31:11,874
a grand maester has served
as the King's Hand.

475
00:31:11,948 --> 00:31:15,748
The king has named Qyburn
the new Master of Whisperers.

476
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:21,359
Your Grace, him? This man?

477
00:31:21,428 --> 00:31:24,637
This embarrassment to the Citadel?

478
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:29,714
Your Grace, what qualifications
can he possibly have for this post?

479
00:31:29,828 --> 00:31:31,910
The qualification of
loyalty, Grand Maester.

480
00:31:32,468 --> 00:31:34,516
That's far more than the eunuch ever had.

481
00:31:35,108 --> 00:31:37,110
Far more than many ever have.

482
00:31:38,108 --> 00:31:39,951
I must say, I cannot see...

483
00:31:40,028 --> 00:31:44,352
Uncle Kevan, in light of your position
as commander of the Lannister armies,

484
00:31:44,468 --> 00:31:47,950
it would please the king
if you would serve as his Master of War.

485
00:31:48,028 --> 00:31:51,191
No man living better deserves the title.

486
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:53,470
That is kind of you to say.

487
00:31:53,548 --> 00:31:55,835
I would like to hear it
from the king himself.

488
00:31:55,908 --> 00:31:57,194
The king is very busy at this moment.

489
00:31:57,308 --> 00:31:59,709
He should be here

He is learning.

491

On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler,
he's asked me to speak on his behalf.

492
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:09,755
I returned to the capital
to pay my respects to my brother.

493
00:32:09,868 --> 00:32:12,917
And to you. And to serve the king.

494
00:32:12,988 --> 00:32:15,878
I did not return to serve as your puppet.

with sycophants.

00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:27,629
What mission?

500
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:30,473
That is not your concern as Master of War.

501

I do not recognize your authority
to dictate what is and is not my concern.

You would abandon your king
in his time of need?

504
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:50,591
If he wants to send for me,
I will be waiting for him.

509
00:33:08,748 --> 00:33:10,671

510
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:12,836
Snake. S.

You'll learn, I promise.

517
00:33:28,028 --> 00:33:31,111
I taught Ser Davos, and old people
are terrible at learning new things.

Very patient.

I only said that the more time
that you spend practicing,

the faster you'll be able to read.

That's all right. We're doing just fine.

have a lot to talk about.

No, old Maester Cressen did.

528

529

How did they cure you?

537
00:34:21,988 --> 00:34:24,719
I don't remember. I was a baby.

538

My father made them move out of the keep
into the hut outside.

542
00:34:39,868 --> 00:34:42,075
None of us were allowed to go near them.

543

But we heard them, especially at night.

544
00:34:46,748 --> 00:34:50,355
They started to sound not like themselves.

Only once at the end.

547

They were covered with it.

548

Their faces, their arms.

549
00:35:04,028 --> 00:35:05,439
They acted like animals.

550
00:35:06,948 --> 00:35:10,157
My father had to drag them
out to the woods on a rope.

- Why?
- She's a wildling.

Her name is Gilly. She's nice.
I'm teaching her to read.

00:35:33,668 --> 00:35:36,990
She's a wildling.
Your father defeated her people.

559
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,833
He executed their king for treason.

560
00:35:39,908 --> 00:35:42,752
They could strike at him
by striking at you.

561

Gilly wouldn't do that.

You prevented that order
from being carried out.

566

You showed mercy to Mance Rayder.

A king's word is law.

568

Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos
how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.
