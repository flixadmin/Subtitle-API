It was my fault.

I wanted to ask you not to blame her.

186

How could I possibly blame her
for doing the same things that I did?

187
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,205
- I never meant to--
- She was my sister.

188
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,284
I couldn't be angry
because she was dead.

189

I couldn't grieve

By the way, your cute friend's here.

469
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,809
You left the party quick last night,
even after I stocked the bar with Pinot Noir.

470
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,200
It wasn't really my scene.

471
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,249
I thought maybe you and Oliver
went mano-a-mano again.

472
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,811
I saw you two head out.

473
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,248
There's nothing between Oliver and I.
Not anymore.

474
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,887
And here I thought the only thing
between you and Oliver was us.

475
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:34,045
I wouldn't characterize us
as an us, Tommy.

476
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,049
- Then what would you call it?
- A lapse.

477
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,689
It's quite a few lapses. Your place.
My place. My place again.

478
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,880
Come on, Merlyn.

479
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,731
We both know that
you're not a one-girl type of guy.

480
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,604
Depends on the girl.

481
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,964
I have to go back to work.

482
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,602
Dinah Laurel Lance.

483
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,644
Always trying to save the world.

484
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,883
Hey, If I don't try and save it, who will?

485
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,241
OLIVER:
She says the island changed me.

486
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,050
She has no idea how much.

487
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,171
There are many more names on the list...

488
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,325
...those who rule my city
through intimidation and fear.

489
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,289
Every last one of them
will wish I had died on that island.

490
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,081
The police failed to identify the men
I hired to kidnap Oliver.

491
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,004
And they never will.

492
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,085
- Should we arrange another abduction?
MOIRA: No.

493
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,202
There are other ways of finding out
what my son knows.

494
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,642
[English - US - SDH]
