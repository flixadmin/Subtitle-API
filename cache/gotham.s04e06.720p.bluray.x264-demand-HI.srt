Detective James Gordon.

488
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,848
I hope you don't mind if I say,

489
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,058
I'm tickled pink to meet you.

490
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:01,266
I would shake your hand,
if it were possible.

491
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:05,066
I'm a big fan. Big, big fan.

492
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,654
Right. My biggest fan is a pig.

493

Tell me where Harvey Bullock is.

494

Oh!

495
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,618
That dirty pig.

496
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,821
Why do you waste your time with him?

497
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,156
He's holding you back.

498
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,453
Or can you not see that?

Never you fret.

He's still alive,
for the time being anyway.

502

But you, Detective,
you are safe as safe can be.

You a cop?

504
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:39,391
(LAUGHS) What?
What makes you think that?

505
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,726
The things you knew,

506
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,309
the routes and schedules
of the cops you've killed.

507
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,062
If I were a policeman,

00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:52,491

Jim, that's exactly
what I was going to do.

I beg to differ, <i>mon frère.</i>

515
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:15,056
You and I both see
all too well the corruption,

516
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:19,515

517
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:24,683
You and I know
that Gotham cannot survive

518

unless the cancer is cut out.

519
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,901
We both share the same mission.

520
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:34,112
Only I do it
with a little bit more flair.

521
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,404
Killing Penguin's bagmen
won't change anything.

522
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,364
It will for them.

523
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,286
It will quite a bit.

524
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,874
But, in the larger scope,
you're right.

525
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,714
Which is why it doesn't stop there.

526
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,924
Not until I've butchered

527
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:55,506
every single swine
on Penguin's payroll.

528
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,844
That could be half the department.

529
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,059
I never said it would be pretty.

530
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,686
Oh, it's the same old story.

531
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:07,063
No one wants to see how the sausage
is made, but once it is made...

Mmm.

00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,061
Isn't it delicious?

Bite?

535

You're delusional.
You're not doing this for Gotham,

536
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,618
you're doing it
for your own demented reasons.

537

My reasons are as real
as they come, Jim.

00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,906
Your very survival depends on seeing
everyone as a potential threat.

643
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,118
I watched my father
bear that weight for years.

644
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,833
I don't want you to end up like him.

645
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,046
Sofia, please forgive me.

646
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,003
How can I

647
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,589
when I've already forgiven you?

648
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,590
- Well, you do owe me one thing.
- Anything.

649
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:56,592
Lunch.

650
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,224
How do you feel about mac and cheese?

651
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,265
I love it.

652
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,395
(MONITOR BEEPING)

653
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,029
GORDON: Hi.

654
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:16,987
Hey.

655
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,748
You gave me
quite the scare back there.

656
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:20,824
How you feeling?

657
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,625
I've had better days.

658
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,919
- Doc says you're gonna be okay.
- Shows what he knows.

659
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,296
The Pyg?

660
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,133
Son of a bitch.

661
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,977
He could have killed me,
but he cut me just deep enough

662
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:45,604
to make you choose, go after him,
or save my worthless hide.

663
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:47,818
That wasn't a choice.

664
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,063
Either way, I owe you.

665
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,909
So pay it back now.

666
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,200
Tell me the truth.

667
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,282
How long have you been
taking money from Penguin?

668
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,327
You knew Metzger was the bagman.

669
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,708
You knew Nakajima was dirty.

670
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:13,257
The Pyg says all this stuff
about you deserving to be killed.

671
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,515
I don't know why I didn't see it
before, maybe I didn't want to.

672
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:23,975
I just need to know how long?

673
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,891
Are we talking years?

674
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:30,353
No, just since
this license crap started.

675
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,948
The commissioner
ordered us to comply.

676
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:40,241
Then Metzger started showing up with
these envelopes stuffed full of cash.

677
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,162
I didn't do nothing
I wouldn't have done anyway.

678
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:51,333
You gotta understand, Jim.
The bills I got, the debts I got.

679
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,625
It stops.

680
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,050
Stops now.

681
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:08,641
REPORTER ON TV:<i>...officers of the GCPD

THE PYG:
"Two mother pigs lived in a pen.

689
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:38,053
"They each had four piglets

690
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:40,889
"and that made ten.

691
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,389
"All the piglets loved to play.

692
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:49,477
"And they rolled
and they rolled in the mud all day.

693
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:56,484
"At night with their mothers
curled up in a heap,

694
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,617
"they squealed and they squealed

695
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:04,030
"until they went...

696
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,123
"to sleep.

697
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:13,999
"And sleep well,
for tomorrow the ax shall fall."
