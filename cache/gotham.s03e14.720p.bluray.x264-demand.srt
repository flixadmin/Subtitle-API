644
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,927
Yeah, but you didn't, now, did you?
You controlled your anger.

645
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,081
It wasn't just anger.

646
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,365
After everything Jerome had done,

647
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,324
after all the pain he caused,

648
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,171
the idea of killing him...

649
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,882
- Felt...
- It felt right.

650
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,601
Yes.

651
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,681
It felt like justice.

652
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,370
There's a very fine line, Master Bruce,

653
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,411
- between justice and vengeance.
- I know.

654
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,040
But that doesn't mean there isn't one.

655
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,521
No, it doesn't.

656
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,523
I knew where the line was tonight, Alfred.

657
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,527
I didn't cross it.

658
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,971
- Well, that's the first rule.
- What do you mean?

659
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,120
Now, I started training you
so you could defend yourself.

660
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,128
Well, we're well past that, aren't we?

661
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,408
But what's all this training for?
What are you gonna do with it?

662
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,244
- I don't know.
- Nor do I.

663
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,006
But if you keep going,

664
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,166
you're gonna need rules.

665
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,729
Rules you cannot and you will not break.

666
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,565
Never mind what reason,
never mind what the circumstance.

667
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,481
I will not kill.

668
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,646
Say it again.

669
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,046
I will not kill.

670
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,241
Then let's get to work.

671
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,406
KATHRYN: Tonight, was close.

672
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,283
We could have lost Gotham for good.

673
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,601
Soon, we will act,
and you will be called upon.

674
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,964
I've done a
wonderful job erasing the scars.

675
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,882
- Are you prepared?
- Yes.

676
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,520
But I still don't understand
how I can help save Gotham.

677
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,641
FRANK: Never fear.

678
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,286
You're only part of the plan.

679
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,246
Are you sure about this?

680
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,922
You know what must happen if he refuses.

681
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,127
I know.

682
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,930
No one refuses the Court.

683
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,521
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

684
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,610
- Uncle Frank?
- Hello, Jim.

685
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,527
It's been a long time.

686
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,201
Ed, I love you.

687
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,331
I know you believe that now.

688
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,723
So, you need to
listen to me when I tell you,

689
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,043
by doing this, it will change you.

690
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,889
- I've killed before, Oswald.
- Not like this.

691
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,886
This won't be a crime
of passion or self-preservation.

692
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,683
This will be the cold-blooded
murder of someone you love.

693
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,441
I don't love you.

694

(GRUNTS)

695
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,564
You need me, Edward Nygma.

696
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,526
Just as I need you.

697
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,768
You cannot have one without the other.

698
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,004
You killed Isabella.

699
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,084
- The point is...
- That is the point!

700
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,927
You can't talk
your way out of this, Oswald.

701
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,846
I have wanted you
to suffer as I've suffered.

702
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,607
You killed her. So, you die.

703
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,566
When I met you,
you were a nervous, jittery loser.

704
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,125
You were nothing!

705
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,606
I created Edward Nygma!

706
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,449
And I am the only one in the world
who truly sees you as you are.

707
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,247
Who you can still become.

708
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,404
You can't do this.

709
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,805
Ed, are you listening to me?

710
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,047
I'm listening.

711
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,005
Say something.

712
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,766
I loved her, Oswald.

713
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,809
- And you killed her.
