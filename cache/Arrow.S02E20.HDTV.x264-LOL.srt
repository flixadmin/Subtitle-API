1
00:00:00,635 --> 00:00:02,702
Previously, on "Arrow..."

2
00:00:02,704 --> 00:00:06,146
But there are some things that must
never be spoken of.

3
00:00:06,147 --> 00:00:09,781
How could you not tell me
Malcolm Merlyn was my father?!

4
00:00:09,783 --> 00:00:11,850
Sara, you're not a killer!

5
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:13,452
I am what I need to be.

6
00:00:13,454 --> 00:00:15,754
Roy, you're
dangerous.

7
00:00:15,756 --> 00:00:17,890
Some people
are just broken, man.

8
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,159
I am not letting what happened
to Slade happen to Roy.

9
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:22,027
Is that what
I think it is?

10
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:24,963
Mirakuru. We're going
to use it to make a cure.

11
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:30,269
No change?

12
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:31,737
Nope.

13
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:34,606
So much blood mixed in
with so much Mirakuru,

14
00:00:34,608 --> 00:00:36,808
I don't know
if it's good or bad.

15
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,744
We could really
use that cure.

16
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:40,512
I talked to Caitlin
this morning.

17
00:00:40,514 --> 00:00:42,681
They're
working on it.

18
00:00:42,683 --> 00:00:44,149
No mention on
Isabel Rochev's death?

19
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:46,084
Not a thing.
I wasn't expecting

20
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:48,720
a glowing obituary,
but she's a Fortune 500

21
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:50,222
CEO that's been missing
for a week now.

22
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:52,357
You'd think she'd have
some column inches.

23
00:00:58,264 --> 00:01:00,933
Does the fact that him lying
there freaks me out a little

24
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,701
make me a bad person?

25
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:04,369
Felicity, I don't think there's
a force on earth

26
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:07,072
that can make you a bad person.
But I am starving.

27
00:01:07,074 --> 00:01:08,740
Dinner?

28
00:01:08,742 --> 00:01:10,275
Yeah.

29
00:01:10,277 --> 00:01:12,411
No Big Belly burger, though.

30
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:13,912
It's giving me a Big Belly.

31
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:15,948
Sushi, then.

32
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,517
Sushi, then.

33
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,490
How can you be unconscious
and freak me out at the same...

34
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,128
Time?

35
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,898
Roy?

36
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:38,303
Oh, my God!

37
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:40,138
Oh, you scared me.

38
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:43,809
Roy?

39
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:46,745
Forgot my phone.

40
00:01:52,986 --> 00:01:54,453
Roy, listen--

41
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:56,989
Dig!

42
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,757
You ok?
Go!

43
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,759
Roy!

44
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:02,361
Roy!

45
00:02:02,363 --> 00:02:03,762
What's going on?

46
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,508
Move, move, move, move,
move, move, move, move!

47
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,943
Move, move!

You think Roy's ok?

52
00:02:42,236 --> 00:02:47,172
Please tell me that you're not thinking
about Roy right now.

53
00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:50,275
We're finally alone, in bed,

54
00:02:50,277 --> 00:02:52,744
in a very nice hotel room.

55
00:02:52,746 --> 00:02:56,448
A hotel room that
you couldn't afford.

56
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,984
I have something
of a history with the manager.

57
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:01,953
Mmm. I can
only imagine.

58
00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:07,592
I think I trashed
this specific room once.

59
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:09,928
But favors run out.

60
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,665
We should think about
getting a more permanent place.

61
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,805
We?

62
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:23,575
Well, you're probably getting
tired of staying with Laurel,

63
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:28,813
and we can't sleep in the foundry now
that Roy's there, so...

64
00:03:28,815 --> 00:03:31,716
But, I mean, "we,"

65
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:33,685
now you're asking me
to move in with you?

66
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:41,693
Hey, your phone's
ringing.

67
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:43,228
I know.

68
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:48,199
Okay, both our
phones are ringing,

69
00:03:48,201 --> 00:03:50,502
that's never good.

70
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:59,778
What happened?

71
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,646
I don't know.
One minute he's comatose,

72
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:03,581
the next, he's flipping over
computer equipment.

73
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,984
He was a lot more out of control than
Slade was at your house.

74
00:04:05,986 --> 00:04:08,286
He looked like Roy,
but he...wasn't Roy.

75
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:09,586
Where do you think he's headed?

76
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:10,523
I don't know,

77
00:04:10,524 --> 00:04:12,323
but we have to find him.

78
00:04:14,527 --> 00:04:16,394
Despite everyone's
predictions,

79
00:04:16,396 --> 00:04:19,364
you've managed to pull ahead
of Sebastian Blood in recent polls.

80
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:22,934
Yes. I think our message
is resonating with the voters.

81
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:26,204
The people of Starling know
that I have a vision,

82
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:29,507
and the experienced apparatus to make
that vision a reality.

83
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:31,142
What would you say
is the main reason

84
00:04:31,144 --> 00:04:33,511
they should vote for you
over alderman Blood?

85
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:35,447
Well, um...

86
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:38,817
Alderman Blood
isn't a parent.

87
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:42,020
And the soul
of being a parent

88
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:44,589
is making sure that
your children have a bright future.

89
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:47,392
And I've been very lucky to be able
to do that for my own.

90
00:04:47,394 --> 00:04:49,794
Yeah.
Mother of the year.

91
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:52,230
Uh, we're in the middle
of an interview.

92
00:04:52,232 --> 00:04:54,032
Oh, I'll keep it short.

93
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:56,434
You can't have
your rally at verdant.

94
00:04:56,436 --> 00:04:58,670
It's the only place I have that hasn't
been poisoned by you.

95
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:01,306
Can you give me
one moment, please?

96
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:02,674
Turn it off.

97
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:04,476
Thea, I know you're upset,

98
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:06,878
and you have every right to be,
but we need to talk somewhere else.

99
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,714
I'm done talking.
I just came by to tell you,

100
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:12,617
it'll be a cold day in hell before
you can use my club.

101
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:14,953
We can't just change
the venue the day before.

102
00:05:14,955 --> 00:05:16,588
I'm sure you can
figure something else.

103
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,057
I mean, you have such
an experienced apparatus.

104
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:20,792
You signed a contract.

105
00:05:20,794 --> 00:05:22,794
Huh.

106
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:26,598
Just when I thought
you couldn't go any lower...

107
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,300
You threaten
your own daughter.

108
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:39,677
Moira.

109
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,946
What's going on?

110
00:05:41,948 --> 00:05:44,616
Sorry you had to witness that.

111
00:05:44,618 --> 00:05:47,185
After her abduction, I'd think that
the two of you would be closer than ever.

112
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:49,687
It's a very
complicated situation.

113
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:52,357
Well, my advice?

114
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:54,025
Simplify it.

115
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:57,662
You have to be
either a mother or a candidate.

116
00:05:57,664 --> 00:05:58,930
You can't be both.

117
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:02,534
Not right now.
You cannot split your focus.

118
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,671
You're absolutely right.

119
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:11,442
You're really cute
when you're mopey.

120
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:15,680
I'm not mopey.

121
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:18,550
Mopey's your default, Ollie.

122
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:21,386
It's part of
your smoldering charm.

123
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:24,622
I do have
smoldering charm.

124
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,128
But you're more
than usual mopey.

125
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,131
Is everything all right?

126
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:40,839
It's fine.

127
00:06:43,142 --> 00:06:45,510
Ollie.

128
00:06:45,512 --> 00:06:47,846
Tommy had me out
a little bit later

129
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:49,681
than maybe I should have been,

130
00:06:49,683 --> 00:06:51,983
and...

131
00:06:51,985 --> 00:06:54,285
I'm wiped.

132
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:56,521
Well, you want me to go?

133
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:59,324
I promised Sara I'd help her
with her trigonometry.

134
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:01,292
I don't know what that is.

135
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:03,862
You are very cute.

136
00:07:06,732 --> 00:07:09,000
Get some sleep.

137
00:07:09,002 --> 00:07:11,302
Mm-hmm.

138
00:07:12,504 --> 00:07:14,305
Bye.

139
00:07:14,307 --> 00:07:16,207
Bye.

140
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:18,009
Good night,
Mrs. Queen.

141
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:19,677
Good night.

142
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:27,752
You didn't go
out with Tommy last night.

143
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:29,854
Hey.

144
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:33,424
Thanks for eavesdropping
on my entire conversation, Mom.

145
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:34,792
That's--that's nice.

146
00:07:34,794 --> 00:07:36,661
Sweetheart,
something's bothering you,

147
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:38,897
tell me what it is.

148
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:42,700
Dad's going to kill me.

149
00:07:42,702 --> 00:07:45,570
Your father
loves you.

150
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:46,641
I love you.

151
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,869
I screwed up.

152
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:52,043
It's bad.

153
00:07:53,345 --> 00:07:55,613
What happened?

154
00:07:57,783 --> 00:08:01,486
I got a girl pregnant.

155
00:08:01,488 --> 00:08:05,757
Laurel's pregnant?

156
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,559
No.

157
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:12,163
Not Laurel.

158
00:08:20,072 --> 00:08:21,572
This is ridiculous.

159
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:23,341
We can't just ride
around all night

160
00:08:23,343 --> 00:08:25,209
hoping to lay eyes
on him.

161
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:27,946
- Diggle?
- His place is clean.

162
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:30,048
I don't think
he's been back here.

163
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,749
Call just went out for an ambulance
at 14th and Hobart.

164
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:34,018
There's four men
seriously assaulted...

165
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,154
By someone wearing
a red hoodie.

166
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:49,701
What happened?

167
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:52,203
Guy jumped us.
Came out of nowhere.

168
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:55,239
The dude is 'roided out
or something.

169
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:57,642
Crazy like.

170
00:08:57,644 --> 00:09:00,478
See ya, Sin.

171
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,948
Adios. Yo, Abercrombie.

172
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,785
Hold up.
Where you been, man?

173
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:09,091
I went over to
your place like 20 times.

174
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:10,515
Thea said you skipped town.

175
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:15,493
Holy crap.

176
00:09:15,495 --> 00:09:17,929
Have you been
in a fight?

177
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:22,633
Hey, Sin, is this guy
bothering you?

178
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:24,936
No, no, no, he's chill.
Seriously, just step off.

179
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:26,603
We going to have a problem, guy?

180
00:09:26,628 --> 00:09:27,473
Seriously?

181
00:09:27,474 --> 00:09:29,440
Just leave him
alone, he's fine.

182
00:09:29,442 --> 00:09:31,442
Oh, what, you got
nothing smart to say?

183
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:55,198
Felicity's running
facial recognition

184
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,765
on traffic cameras
throughout the city.

185
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:58,467
Which could take forever.
We need to take Roy down now

186
00:09:58,469 --> 00:10:00,235
before he attacks
any more people.

187
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:01,736
What part of "I want
nothing to do with you"

188
00:10:01,738 --> 00:10:03,104
are just not understanding?

189
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:06,241
I came by to see Sara.

190
00:10:06,243 --> 00:10:07,776
And what about him?

191
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:09,307
He's been
stalking me.

192
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,130
He's protecting you.

193
00:10:10,155 --> 00:10:11,147
From what?

194
00:10:11,148 --> 00:10:12,481
Slade Wilson is still at large.

195
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:14,282
He already tried
hurting you once.

196
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:16,184
He didn't hurt me.

197
00:10:16,186 --> 00:10:18,386
He told me the truth, which
I know you think is a bad thing,

198
00:10:18,388 --> 00:10:19,887
but it's actually not.

199
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,224
It is if it costs me you.

200
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:23,758
Your lies did that.

201
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,027
Now, I'm going to go upstairs
to the stock room,

202
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:28,029
and if I get attacked by some
shot glasses,

203
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:29,965
I'll call 911.

204
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:34,970
Thanks for taking
care of her.

205
00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:37,806
Lucky for me, she's not as good
at disappearing as you were.

206
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:43,745
I'll be right back.

207
00:10:43,747 --> 00:10:45,881
Have you seen Thea?

208
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:47,449
What happened
to your eye?

209
00:10:47,451 --> 00:10:49,084
It's ok. I could
cover it with make-up.

210
00:10:49,086 --> 00:10:51,019
If I work make-up.

211
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:51,857
It's fine.

212
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:53,456
Who did this to you?

213
00:10:53,457 --> 00:10:54,410
It's a long story.

214
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:55,324
I asked you who.

215
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:57,425
Roy.

216
00:10:57,427 --> 00:10:59,961
But he's not right
in the head.

217
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:01,730
He got injected
with something.

218
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:03,932
A drug, I don't know,
but it made him strong.

219
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:05,834
Like, comic book strong.

220
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:07,536
Look, I know it sounds nuts--

221
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:09,437
it really doesn't.

222
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,239
Sara, Roy's a friend.

223
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:13,375
He needs help,
not a beat down.

224
00:11:18,014 --> 00:11:21,917
I'll have
to call you right back.

225
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:24,352
Do you want me
to stay, Mr. Blood?

226
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:26,655
Uh, no, no, thank you.

227
00:11:26,657 --> 00:11:28,590
I'll be fine.

228
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:32,494
My new body man.

229
00:11:32,496 --> 00:11:33,929
He's a little over-protective.

230
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:34,896
Hmm.

231
00:11:34,898 --> 00:11:36,598
Please.
No, thank you.

232
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,867
I'd say this visit
is unexpected,

233
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:41,136
but I despise understatements.

234
00:11:41,138 --> 00:11:42,370
I'm dropping out
of the race.

235
00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:43,805
I'm making
a concession speech

236
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:45,707
at my rally tonight.

237
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,909
You're ahead
in the latest polls.

238
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:50,645
Even the most skeptical pundits are saying
you could actually pull this out.

239
00:11:50,647 --> 00:11:53,648
I felt I owed you the courtesy of
informing you in person.

240
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,719
I don't, however, owe you
an explanation as well.

241
00:11:57,721 --> 00:12:00,322
No, you don't.

242
00:12:00,324 --> 00:12:02,958
But I'd appreciate one.

243
00:12:04,594 --> 00:12:06,294
What you're doing, Moira,

244
00:12:06,296 --> 00:12:08,730
as much as it benefits me,

245
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:11,232
doesn't really make much sense.

246
00:12:15,404 --> 00:12:18,073
It's my daughter.

247
00:12:18,075 --> 00:12:21,576
At the moment, she needs me
more than Starling does.

248
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:24,913
Well, you're doing
the right thing.

249
00:12:24,915 --> 00:12:29,217
I'm going to change
this city, Moira.

250
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:31,853
A new day is coming.

251
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:33,188
A better day.

252
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,056
For all of us.

253
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,327
I know things seem
bleak, sweetheart,

254
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:41,529
but we're going
to figure this out, I promise.

255
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:43,665
Mom, does it seem fair?

256
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,667
To make...

257
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,206
One mistake, and it...

258
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:54,175
Feels like
my entire life is over.

259
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:58,179
Oh, your life
is far from over.

260
00:12:59,882 --> 00:13:03,018
Are you sure
it's yours?

261
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,222
Where there is
money, Oliver,

262
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:09,791
there are people
looking to take advantage.

263
00:13:09,793 --> 00:13:12,327
She's not that type of person.
She's a good person, Mom.

264
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:13,762
She's...

265
00:13:13,764 --> 00:13:16,031
All right.

266
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:18,600
I don't know what to do.
What do I do?

267
00:13:22,538 --> 00:13:26,141
We all make mistakes,
Oliver. And I had hoped

268
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:30,912
that one day you'd forgive me for any
that I might make, so...

269
00:13:30,914 --> 00:13:35,316
All right, um,
I'll be right back.

270
00:13:37,753 --> 00:13:39,921
Verdant, 14th and Hobart,

271
00:13:39,923 --> 00:13:41,956
and the bar Sin
spotted him at.

272
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,225
He looks to be moving east.
What's east?

273
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:46,027
Queen mansion.

274
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:47,694
If he still remembers
where Thea lives--

275
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:48,698
well, used to live,

276
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:50,398
but Roy doesn't
know that...

277
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,767
There might be something
in Roy still left in there.

278
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:55,103
Or it's just a coincidence
that he's moving east.

279
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:57,205
Ahem. I know
that Sin's involved,

280
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:59,107
but don't let that
cloud your judgment.

281
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:02,143
Well, don't let the fact that
this used to be Roy cloud yours.

282
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:07,615
Sin.

283
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:09,117
I found Roy.

284
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,919
Well, I thought I
told you to go home.

285
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:12,654
Yeah, that's where I am
right now.

286
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:16,357
And so is he.

287
00:14:23,065 --> 00:14:25,967
Roy!

288
00:14:38,214 --> 00:14:39,647
He's not here.

289
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:04,839
It's Oliver.

290
00:15:04,841 --> 00:15:07,509
It's me.

291
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:09,477
What you're doing right now,

292
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:11,946
it's because of the Mirakuru.

293
00:15:11,948 --> 00:15:14,616
You're a good person, Roy.
You have a conscience

294
00:15:14,618 --> 00:15:16,951
and a soul.
I need you to use those

295
00:15:16,953 --> 00:15:20,221
and fight this.
You can do it!

296
00:15:38,074 --> 00:15:40,708
Drop the arrow, drop it!

297
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,015
Ahh!

298
00:15:53,123 --> 00:15:54,522
No!

299
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,181
A full moon tonight.

300
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:14,286
That really brings out
the whack jobs.

301
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:17,855
Good news is,
it can't get any stranger.

302
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:19,991
My friend
needs your help.

303
00:16:19,993 --> 00:16:22,560
I was wrong.
Got to call you back.

304
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:26,397
Some of this damage
is chronic.

305
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,533
The cost of jumping off
rooftops, I guess.

306
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:31,069
I need to get back on my feet.

307
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:33,204
I can give you a brace,
but you'll still be

308
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:36,074
in horrendous amounts
of pain. Six months ago,

309
00:16:36,076 --> 00:16:37,709
this cabinet
would have been empty.

310
00:16:37,711 --> 00:16:40,408
The Chinese Triad was stopping all
of our med shipments--

311
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:43,977
until someone stopped them.

312
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:47,914
Ever since, I've been looking
for a way to thank you.

313
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,894
If you're going to have to
follow me everywhere,

314
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,530
at least don't lurk,
all right?

315
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:09,569
I can't let you
out of my sight.

316
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:12,605
You're sick of seeing me
everywhere you go;

317
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:14,674
lurking seemed like
a good compromise.

318
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:17,844
Yeah, well, it's not.

319
00:17:22,383 --> 00:17:24,050
Family's hard.

320
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:25,685
Sometimes they're the hardest
in the world.

321
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:28,054
Loving someone so much
and letting them love you back.

322
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:30,723
You know, you're right...
You should go back to lurking.

323
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:32,650
I've spent a lot of time
with your family.

324
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,718
If you think that gives you the right
to weigh in, you're wrong.

325
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,687
Plus, Oliver will be out of money soon
and you'll be unemployed.

326
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,522
Right.

327
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:41,958
I guess I should get
this in under the wire.

328
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,761
You know, your mother
isn't perfect.

329
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,830
Her judgment
definitely isn't.

330
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,665
But there's one thing she's
consistent about

331
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,533
is that she loves
you and Oliver.

332
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:52,736
And that should
buy her what in your mind?

333
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,472
Well, I don't know,
Thea...

334
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,874
But she is
your mother.

335
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,976
That should buy
her something.

336
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,412
A second chance,
maybe.

337
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,347
...A citywide man hunt

338
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,682
for the perpetrator of an attack

339
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,851
that left one police officer
seriously injured

340
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,452
and the other dead.

341
00:18:09,454 --> 00:18:12,322
We have video
shot by a bystander,

342
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:16,292
but please be warned that the footage
may be too graphic for some viewers.

343
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:19,896
Oh, my God.

344
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,331
Thea...

345
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,666
I have to go
see a friend.

346
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,268
If you have
to follow, follow.

347
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,738
These aren't going
to fix your knee.

348
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,007
They'll help it heal faster.
And until then?

349
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:35,378
Where are we with
facial recognition?

350
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,747
Traffic cams can't
get a clear shot.

351
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,049
Now I see why
you wear that hood.

352
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,051
Felicity...
We need to find Roy

353
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,519
before the police do.

354
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,421
Because they'll kill
him and we won't?

355
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:48,324
S.T.A.R. Labs
is working on a cure.

356
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:49,893
Which they may
never come up with.

357
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,761
And even if they do,
I mean, how many people

358
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,563
are we going to let Roy
kill in the meantime?

359
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:54,985
You know, you wanted
to kill Helena, too.

360
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,233
You found another way.

361
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:57,867
That was different,
and you know it.

362
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:00,403
Roy has the Mirakuru
in him, just like Slade.

363
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,473
And if you had a clear shot of Slade
right now, you would take it.

364
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,908
Roy isn't Slade!

365
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,309
Roy isn't Roy.

366
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,343
He's not himself
anymore,

367
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:09,612
he's too far gone.

368
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:11,381
I don't believe that.

369
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,585
Do you even hear yourself
right now, Ollie?

370
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:19,255
This is the exact conversation that
we had five years ago,

371
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:22,425
except we were
freezing on Lian Yu.

372
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:31,768
What are you doing?

373
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,570
What needs to be done.

374
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,772
The Mirakuru won't do anything
against a head shot.

375
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,373
Sara!

376
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,808
Your mother's rally starts in
a half an hour.

377
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,744
I'd start getting dressed
if I were you.

378
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:57,761
She reminds me so much
of me after I came home.

379
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,997
When it just seemed...

380
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:04,968
Seemed impossible to believe
in anything even resembling hope.

381
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,770
But you did.

382
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,838
You did.

383
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,142
Eventually.

384
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,444
Sara will, too.

385
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:26,322
Oh, thanks for coming.

386
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:28,758
It's chill.
Who's that?

387
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,994
I...my shadow.

388
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,997
Listen, something
is going on with Roy.

389
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,499
I know, I saw him.
He's totally crazed.

390
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,168
What's happening to him?

391
00:20:40,437 --> 00:20:43,807
Do you remember around Christmas
when he bailed on us?

392
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,441
Yeah?

393
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:48,311
He got shot up with something,
this drug,

394
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,979
and it's been messing
with his head.

395
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:52,315
Did you tell my brother
any of this?

396
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,784
No...Why?

397
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,619
He's got this bodyguard
all over me.

398
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:58,555
He must know about Roy,

399
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,790
think he's coming
after me or something.

400
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,192
Well, what are you
going to do?

401
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:09,833
Roy?

402
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,902
Roy, it's me.

403
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,305
It's Thea.

404
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:19,642
I'm so glad I found you.

405
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:22,412
I've been looking
everywhere.

406
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:26,149
This is all my fault.

407
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,052
I did this to you.

408
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,221
When you broke up with me,
it was a cry for help,

409
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,557
and I didn't listen.

410
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,262
I should be punished.

411
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:42,298
I deserve to be punished.

412
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,569
Someone hurts you,
and you hurt them worse.

413
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:49,839
You hurt them permanently.

414
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:53,843
You should just kill me.

415
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,745
Kill me.

416
00:21:57,548 --> 00:22:00,149
Kill me.

417
00:22:04,763 --> 00:22:06,529
Oliver, where have you
been?

418
00:22:06,554 --> 00:22:07,794
Haven't you got
any of my calls?

419
00:22:07,795 --> 00:22:09,761
I've been busy.
What's wrong?

420
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:11,997
It's your mother.
She'll do fine.

421
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,199
No, she won't.

422
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:16,568
She's not using
this event to rally the troops.

423
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,236
She's using it...

424
00:22:18,238 --> 00:22:20,939
to tell people she's dropping
out of the race.

425
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,649
Oliver.

426
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:33,251
What happened?

427
00:22:33,253 --> 00:22:35,320
It's a motorcycle
accident,

428
00:22:35,322 --> 00:22:37,022
it was stupid.

429
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:40,726
Yes, this would be the second
accident in as many weeks,

430
00:22:40,728 --> 00:22:42,461
if my math is correct.

431
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:44,296
Mark says you're dropping
out of the race.

432
00:22:44,298 --> 00:22:48,066
The truth is, I should
have done it weeks ago,

433
00:22:48,068 --> 00:22:50,235
after Thea was abducted.

434
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:53,939
My complete focus needs
to be on repairing our relationship.

435
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:55,774
Mom, what's happening
with Thea right now

436
00:22:55,776 --> 00:22:57,876
isn't because you weren't spending
enough time with her.

437
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:00,011
Well, maybe not.
I have to do something

438
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:03,148
and I'm not sure
what else to do.

439
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:07,519
Thea hates you right now
because of the things that you've done.

440
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:10,956
Terrible things.

441
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,494
So let her see you
do something good.

442
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:19,064
As mayor.

443
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:25,704
Mom, I know a little
something about...

444
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:30,275
Sacrificing the people
closest to me

445
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:33,345
for the good
of this city.

446
00:23:33,347 --> 00:23:37,482
It's what you need
to do now.

447
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:39,684
I know.

448
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:43,155
Good.

449
00:23:43,157 --> 00:23:45,390
Oliver, I know.

450
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:50,796
I know.

451
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:02,674
I've known...
since last year,

452
00:24:02,676 --> 00:24:04,342
I suppose.

453
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:06,645
The night of the Undertaking,

454
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:09,915
everything became so clear.

455
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:14,352
It was pretty much the night
I stopped sleeping.

456
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:16,087
Before you say
anything else--

457
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:17,556
There's nothing else to say.

458
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:19,491
Nothing I need to say.

459
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:26,331
Except I could not
be more proud.

460
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:33,271
Can I have Raisa get you
anything to drink?

461
00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:36,708
Or--or something to eat,
perhaps? Please.

462
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:39,778
Where's Oliver?

463
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,148
Ah, he's...running
an errand for me.

464
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,218
I thought it would
give us a chance to talk.

465
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:54,059
With all due respect, um,
Mrs. Queen,

466
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:57,028
what's happening,
it's between me and your son.

467
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,064
Yes.

468
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,506
What is that?

469
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:09,641
Oh, I had one
of our investigators

470
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:11,743
write up a dossier on you.
I'm sorry, but it's a necessary

471
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:15,714
precaution against
a fraudulent claim of paternity.

472
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:17,382
Well, the baby
is Oliver's.

473
00:25:17,384 --> 00:25:18,850
Oh, of that I have no doubt.

474
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:21,286
Our investigators
were quite thorough.

475
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:23,321
But you can imagine

476
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:26,291
how many people
my family attracts

477
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:29,227
who are looking for handouts.

478
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:31,196
Well, I'm not
looking for money.

479
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,599
Of course not.

480
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:38,336
I told you,
I don't want money.

481
00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:40,005
And I'm telling you

482
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:42,407
that this is
my first grandchild.

483
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:47,412
And I want to make certain
that he or she has a bright future.

484
00:25:47,414 --> 00:25:49,581
Please.

485
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,853
This is
a million dollars.

486
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:58,924
I want to make certain
that my son has a bright future as well.

487
00:25:58,926 --> 00:26:01,826
That money is yours

488
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:05,564
once you tell Oliver
that you've lost the baby.

489
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:07,232
What?!

490
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:09,601
And another million
when you return to Central City,

491
00:26:09,603 --> 00:26:11,836
never to speak to him again.

492
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:14,573
Can I offer you some advice,

493
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,608
one mother to another?

494
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,010
When it comes to your children,
there is no action

495
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:20,439
that is inconceivable;

496
00:26:20,464 --> 00:26:22,464
There is no decision
that is impossible.

497
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:26,184
You do what you must
to provide the life that they need.

498
00:26:26,186 --> 00:26:29,020
And I think that $2 million

499
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:33,458
is sufficient to provide
the life that both our children need.

500
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:38,063
Don't you?

501
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:49,908
When I was first approached
about entering this race,

502
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,477
the prospect of winning
seemed a distant,

503
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:55,480
nearly impossible feat.

504
00:26:55,482 --> 00:26:57,983
Now, how could a city that had
suffered so much

505
00:26:57,985 --> 00:27:01,953
place its faith in someone
so responsible for its suffering?

506
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,522
But as the weeks progressed,

507
00:27:04,524 --> 00:27:07,559
good people such as you
raised your voices

508
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:12,130
in support, and I began to think
that I could make a difference.

509
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:14,966
I could help
save this city.

510
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:21,406
But...

511
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:24,376
Recent events
have changed things,

512
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:26,444
and...

513
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:42,560
and now I know I can
make a difference.

514
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,433
And should the honor
become mine,

515
00:27:48,435 --> 00:27:51,436
I promise with
every breath I take

516
00:27:51,438 --> 00:27:53,872
to do what is necessary;

517
00:27:53,874 --> 00:27:57,475
to sacrifice what is necessary
for the good of this city.

518
00:27:57,477 --> 00:28:00,879
Starling City is my
home, you are my family,

519
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:05,316
and there is nothing
more important to me than family.

520
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:08,353
Thank you,
thank you all.

521
00:28:10,824 --> 00:28:12,524
Ahh!
Great speech, Moira.

522
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:15,226
A little too off-book
for my liking,

523
00:28:15,228 --> 00:28:17,028
but we'll work on that.

524
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,663
I thought it was perfect.

525
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:22,133
Um...Hi.

526
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:25,837
I just wanted to come up here
and say a few words.

527
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:29,474
I am so proud
to have my mom here tonight

528
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:32,977
at my club, Verdant,
in the Glades.

529
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:34,179
What is she doing?

530
00:28:34,181 --> 00:28:36,548
She knows this is
being televised.

531
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,218
She's sending a message to Roy,
trying to draw him out.

532
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,521
So vote Queen.
Tell your friends.

533
00:28:43,523 --> 00:28:45,924
Thanks.

534
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:47,525
Thea, that was--

535
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:49,494
That was not for you.

536
00:28:57,137 --> 00:28:58,670
Oh, God, you're heavy.

537
00:28:58,672 --> 00:29:00,138
Is this really all muscle?

538
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,307
Ahem. How many of those
venom arrows do we have?

539
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:04,342
About 20.
I need all of them.

540
00:29:04,344 --> 00:29:06,544
Okay. Are you sure
that's a good idea?

541
00:29:06,546 --> 00:29:08,913
Can you even get into
those leather pants with that knee?

542
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:11,282
Lidocaine. Now.

543
00:29:11,284 --> 00:29:13,852
Ok.

544
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:18,189
Let's see, the bottle
says the proper dose is...

545
00:29:18,191 --> 00:29:20,425
Is all of it.

546
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:22,627
I don't think
that's a good--ooh.

547
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:33,404
Terrific speech,
Moira.

548
00:29:33,406 --> 00:29:35,207
How did we not think of running
you years ago?

549
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,941
Thank you.

550
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:39,911
Uh, can you give me a moment?

551
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:42,080
Mm-hmm,
of course.

552
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:44,015
Oh, hello.

553
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:51,656
You need to go now!
No, no, no!

554
00:29:51,658 --> 00:29:52,991
I can't leave
without my daughter!

555
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:54,559
I'll see to the safety
of your daughter!

556
00:29:54,561 --> 00:29:55,693
Go, go! Thea,
we have to go now!

557
00:29:55,695 --> 00:29:57,095
No, it's Roy!

558
00:29:57,097 --> 00:29:58,698
I'm not leaving him!
He came here for me!

559
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,274
Roy.

560
00:30:09,276 --> 00:30:10,608
Roy, listen to me!

561
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,811
Listen to my voice!

562
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:14,679
I don't know what's
going on with you,

563
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:16,214
but I have to believe the man
I fell in love with

564
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:19,450
is still inside
there, somewhere.

565
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:20,819
You have to fight.
You're strong.

566
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:24,322
You can fight this.
Fight this!

567
00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:33,498
Roy!

568
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,000
Put her down.

569
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:43,812
Please don't.

570
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:45,928
He can't control it!

571
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,963
That's why I don't
have a choice.

572
00:30:47,965 --> 00:30:49,731
Whoa!
Get out of the way.

573
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:51,333
Don't do this.

574
00:30:57,006 --> 00:30:59,241
Kill me.

575
00:30:59,243 --> 00:31:02,344
Please. Kill me.

576
00:31:02,346 --> 00:31:04,746
Please
don't do it!

577
00:31:12,688 --> 00:31:16,625
No one dies tonight.

578
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:18,860
The police...

579
00:31:18,862 --> 00:31:20,262
Go outside.

580
00:31:20,264 --> 00:31:21,897
We'll get Roy
the help he needs.

581
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:23,665
I promise! Go!

582
00:31:27,437 --> 00:31:30,639
Ah, Tibetan
pit viper venom.

583
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:33,308
A constant dose of that can't be
good for you. Right?

584
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,143
It'll keep him sedated
like it did Slade.

585
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:35,901
Until when?

586
00:31:35,926 --> 00:31:37,413
And what happens
when we run out?

587
00:31:37,414 --> 00:31:39,314
It's not like you can buy this stuff
over the counter.

588
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:42,617
Unless you're in Tibet.
Then...maybe.

589
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:44,953
We'll take care of him.

590
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:53,462
I'm not ready
to give up on Roy.

591
00:31:55,965 --> 00:31:59,234
Anyone else crave dim
sum after fisticuffs?

592
00:31:59,236 --> 00:32:00,735
No? Ok.

593
00:32:00,737 --> 00:32:03,371
Dumplings for one, then.

594
00:32:06,109 --> 00:32:08,643
I would have killed him.

595
00:32:10,246 --> 00:32:12,314
I was ready to.

596
00:32:12,316 --> 00:32:15,150
He'd be dead right now
if you wouldn't have stopped me.

597
00:32:15,152 --> 00:32:17,853
But he's not.

598
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:20,455
That's all that matters.

599
00:32:20,457 --> 00:32:23,125
That's not true.

600
00:32:23,127 --> 00:32:26,428
I wanted to kill Roy.

601
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:29,531
Because that's what I do.

602
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:31,566
That's who I am.

603
00:32:31,568 --> 00:32:34,769
I spent six years
in the darkness.

604
00:32:34,771 --> 00:32:37,906
And I looked into
the eyes of the devil

605
00:32:37,908 --> 00:32:40,942
and I gave him my soul.

606
00:32:40,944 --> 00:32:44,112
Let me help you
get it back.

607
00:32:44,114 --> 00:32:46,948
No, you deserve someone better.

608
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:51,253
Someone who can harness
that light that's still inside of you.

609
00:32:51,255 --> 00:32:55,423
But I'm not that person.

610
00:32:55,425 --> 00:32:56,791
And I never will be.

611
00:32:56,793 --> 00:33:00,328
Sara...

612
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,063
Don't.

613
00:33:03,332 --> 00:33:06,067
I'm sorry.

614
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:13,909
I just care about you
too much to be with you.

615
00:33:18,781 --> 00:33:20,582
Hey.

616
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:22,918
Everything ok?

617
00:33:24,987 --> 00:33:27,189
Yeah. Just had
a long day.

618
00:33:27,191 --> 00:33:28,924
How's Roy?
Well, he's alive,

619
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:30,425
no thanks to me.

620
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:33,128
You know, that was brave
getting between us.

621
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:36,097
It took guts.
Not really.

622
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:38,400
I knew you wouldn't
really hurt him.

623
00:33:38,402 --> 00:33:40,835
You're not a killer.

624
00:33:42,171 --> 00:33:43,939
What's this for?

625
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:46,942
Say good-bye.

626
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:48,643
What? Wait,
where are you going?

627
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:52,347
To see an old friend.

628
00:34:05,828 --> 00:34:08,930
We've got every
cop in this city canvassing.

629
00:34:08,932 --> 00:34:09,998
We'll find
this guy.

630
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,167
Thank you.

631
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:13,201
You ok?

632
00:34:13,203 --> 00:34:15,904
Fine. Where were you?

633
00:34:15,906 --> 00:34:17,839
He was with me.

634
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:25,046
Glad to see the two
of you are getting along again.

635
00:34:25,048 --> 00:34:28,250
Thea...

636
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:50,572
You knew about Roy.

637
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:55,043
What?

638
00:34:55,045 --> 00:34:58,647
That's why you had
your bodyguard stalking me.

639
00:34:58,649 --> 00:35:01,683
Somehow, you knew what
was going on with him.

640
00:35:05,888 --> 00:35:08,890
I'm just trying
to protect you.

641
00:35:08,892 --> 00:35:11,860
By not telling me the truth.

642
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:14,262
Just like
with Malcolm Merlyn.

643
00:35:14,264 --> 00:35:16,598
You know, the two of you,

644
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,769
you think you're
protecting me by lying

645
00:35:20,771 --> 00:35:23,138
and by keeping secrets.

646
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,007
But that's what's
actually hurting me.

647
00:35:29,078 --> 00:35:32,113
You're absolutely right.

648
00:35:33,316 --> 00:35:35,650
We need to turn a new page.

649
00:35:35,652 --> 00:35:37,485
It's not going
to be that simple.

650
00:35:37,487 --> 00:35:39,087
Or easy.

651
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:41,589
I know. If the truth
were easy for me,

652
00:35:41,591 --> 00:35:43,958
we wouldn't be
in this situation.

653
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,996
But to start...

654
00:35:47,998 --> 00:35:52,267
There's something about Malcolm
that both you and Oliver

655
00:35:52,269 --> 00:35:55,170
need to know.

656
00:35:55,172 --> 00:35:57,105
Malcolm...

657
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,167
Oliver!

658
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,503
Oliver!

659
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:22,214
Oliver!

660
00:36:22,216 --> 00:36:23,915
Oliver!

661
00:36:27,153 --> 00:36:30,989
I was dead the last time
you were offered this choice.

662
00:36:31,676 --> 00:36:34,110
Slade...

663
00:36:34,112 --> 00:36:36,846
What's happening?

664
00:36:38,181 --> 00:36:41,183
I often wonder
how you looked...

665
00:36:41,185 --> 00:36:45,321
When he pointed
the gun at Shado...

666
00:36:45,323 --> 00:36:47,790
And took her from me.

667
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:49,625
You psychopath.

668
00:36:49,627 --> 00:36:52,495
Shado...Shado
wasn't yours!

669
00:36:52,497 --> 00:36:55,131
No, she was yours.

670
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:58,434
Until you chose
another woman over her.

671
00:36:58,436 --> 00:36:59,969
That's not
what happened!

672
00:36:59,971 --> 00:37:03,439
It is what happened! It is!

673
00:37:03,441 --> 00:37:06,309
She told me!

674
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:09,645
What do you mean, she?
There's nobody there!

675
00:37:09,647 --> 00:37:11,781
Slade...

676
00:37:11,783 --> 00:37:16,085
You were on the island
with Oliver?

677
00:37:16,087 --> 00:37:20,289
I thought I had known
true despair,

678
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:23,759
until I met your son.

679
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:27,697
I trusted him...

680
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:29,632
to make the right choice.

681
00:37:29,634 --> 00:37:31,500
Let me make
the right choice now.

682
00:37:31,502 --> 00:37:33,569
Kill me.

683
00:37:33,571 --> 00:37:34,870
- No!
- No!

684
00:37:34,872 --> 00:37:36,172
Choose me, please!

685
00:37:36,174 --> 00:37:39,108
I am killing you, Oliver.

686
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:42,979
Only more slowly
than you would like.

687
00:37:42,981 --> 00:37:44,714
Don't.

688
00:37:44,716 --> 00:37:48,017
Choose.

689
00:37:48,019 --> 00:37:49,018
Don't--
choose.

690
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,620
Please...

691
00:37:50,622 --> 00:37:52,088
Choose!

692
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:55,124
I swear to God, I am
going to kill you!

693
00:37:55,126 --> 00:37:57,059
No! No!

694
00:37:57,061 --> 00:37:59,695
No.

695
00:37:59,697 --> 00:38:01,697
Mom...

696
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:04,133
No!

697
00:38:04,135 --> 00:38:05,234
Mom, what
are you doing?

698
00:38:05,236 --> 00:38:06,969
There's only one way

699
00:38:06,971 --> 00:38:09,205
this night can end.

700
00:38:09,207 --> 00:38:10,706
No!

701
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:18,881
And we both know that.

702
00:38:18,883 --> 00:38:23,052
Don't we, Mr. Wilson?

703
00:38:23,054 --> 00:38:25,121
Mom!
Please, don't!

704
00:38:25,123 --> 00:38:28,190
Both my children
will live.

705
00:38:28,192 --> 00:38:29,725
Mom!

706
00:38:29,727 --> 00:38:31,560
What are you doing?!

707
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,665
Thea, I love you.

708
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:37,900
Close your eyes, baby!

709
00:38:37,902 --> 00:38:39,568
No!

710
00:38:41,672 --> 00:38:45,875
You possess true courage.

711
00:38:52,215 --> 00:38:54,884
I am truly sorry...

712
00:38:54,886 --> 00:38:57,687
What?

713
00:38:59,523 --> 00:39:02,058
You did not pass that on

714
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,060
to your son.

715
00:39:06,063 --> 00:39:09,231
No!

716
00:39:09,233 --> 00:39:11,367
No!

717
00:39:17,574 --> 00:39:20,409
There is still one person

718
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:23,279
who has to die...

719
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:27,183
Before this can end.

720
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:35,458
Mom?

721
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,927
Mom! No!

722
00:39:37,929 --> 00:39:39,695
No! Mom!

723
00:39:43,234 --> 00:39:46,769
Well, yeah, I'm sorry, too.

724
00:39:46,771 --> 00:39:51,073
Well, listen, if there's
ever anything that I can do--

725
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:54,477
hello?

726
00:39:59,082 --> 00:40:01,617
Who was that?

727
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:04,887
That was, um...

728
00:40:07,624 --> 00:40:11,460
She lost the baby.

729
00:40:11,462 --> 00:40:13,329
Oh.

730
00:40:13,331 --> 00:40:15,231
She said she's sad about it,

731
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:18,400
and she's going to go
back to school in Central City.

732
00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:22,438
Apparently
she has family there.

733
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,208
Well, I'm sure this has been
very traumatic for her.

734
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,310
But it sounds
for the best.

735
00:40:28,312 --> 00:40:29,912
Hmm?

736
00:40:29,914 --> 00:40:32,414
- Sure.
- You ok?

737
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:35,117
Yeah. Yes.

738
00:40:36,753 --> 00:40:40,689
I continue to be
the luckiest guy on the planet.

739
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:42,992
What...

740
00:40:42,994 --> 00:40:47,329
What would I have done if she...

741
00:40:53,303 --> 00:40:55,171
Ahh.

742
00:40:55,173 --> 00:40:58,440
I'm not ready to be a dad.

743
00:40:58,442 --> 00:41:02,044
No. But someday.

744
00:41:02,046 --> 00:41:04,647
It's my fondest hope
for you.

745
00:41:06,684 --> 00:41:09,752
I'm glad I told you.

746
00:41:11,755 --> 00:41:13,355
I don't think that I could have

747
00:41:13,357 --> 00:41:14,824
gotten through something
like this without you.

748
00:41:14,826 --> 00:41:18,961
You're never without me.

749
00:41:18,963 --> 00:41:22,164
My beautiful boy.

750
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:24,967
Ohh.

751
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:36,745
It's, uh...

752
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:38,981
I love you.

753
00:41:38,983 --> 00:41:41,483
I love you.

754
