1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,546
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,713 --> 00:00:05,757
We got a warrant to search his office
and everything in it.

3
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:07,759
I'm just not sure
there's much more to see.

4
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:11,137
We're onto you. Dead people come here
and monsters come out.

5
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:13,598
Rule number one, look after number one.

6
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:16,768
Don't be crazy,
or you'll get yourself killed.

7
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:19,437
Nice to have someone who cares about me.
Thank you.

8
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:23,108
<i>Why do they keep
disappearing down that hallway?</i>

9
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:29,322
Oh, my...

10
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:31,282
<i>Look at the man
next to your father.</i>

11
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,410
Hugo Strange. "The Philosopher."

12
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:35,537
A friend. Someone he trusted.

13
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:39,124
That's not fair. That's not right.

14
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:40,333
<i>Have you seen the news?</i>

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,419
Walking zombies in Gotham? What's new?

16
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:44,963
Victor Fries and Theo Galavan
both went to Arkham as dead men.

17
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,923
- Both returned.
- I don't care.

18
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,091
So did your friend Bridgit.

19
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:49,259
Bridgit Pike!

20
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:53,513
<i>Wait, they sent her to Arkham?</i>

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,848
<i>The only way we're gonna find out</i>

22
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:57,100
<i>what's really going on in there
is if we break in ourselves.</i>

23
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:58,268
<i>But I go alone.</i>

24
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:00,270
- Whoa! Holy cow!
- Aah!

25
00:01:00,437 --> 00:01:01,980
- Forensic guy?
- Street trash girl?

26
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:03,148
Where's Strange right now?

27
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:05,150
<i>There's an elevator,
I'll tell you where it is.</i>

28
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:16,286
<i>Freeze!</i>

29
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:19,372
Bridgit?

30
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:21,249
My name is Firefly.

31
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:31,009
The sooner you stop moving,
the sooner this will be over.

32
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:33,928
Thanks. No, thanks.

33
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:35,513
You can't escape.

34
00:01:37,432 --> 00:01:38,475
Ah!

35
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:41,519
<i>Enjoy yourself, Firefly.</i>

36
00:01:58,203 --> 00:02:00,246
You should feel honored.

37
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:08,087
You are a sacrifice
to the Goddess of Fire.

38
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,220
It's a blessing few receive.

39
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:28,066
Man, Bridgit.
Someone sure scrambled your eggs.

40
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:55,260
You're late, Selina.
I was starting to get worried.

41
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:59,264
I'm not late.
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

42
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:05,061
- Have you seen Selina?
- No.

43
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:09,941
So, you're back to being a rich kid, huh?

44
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:13,403
Why does your face look like that?

45
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:15,196
Selina.

46
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,825
She's in trouble and it's my fault.

47
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:31,629
Regarding last night's
nocturnal activities,

48
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:34,716
the suspect calling himself Azrael

49
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,260
led a one-man assault upon Wayne Manor,

50
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:42,015
whereupon an altercation ensued,
in which said suspect

51
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:47,353
was blown up by a person
or persons unknown.

52
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:50,315
So he's dead. Any questions?

53
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,525
Can you confirm
that the man known as Azrael

54
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:54,652
was, in fact, disgraced Mayor Galavan?

55
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,988
Well, seeing as how
the suspect is now meat dust,

56
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:59,157
a positive identification
would be difficult.

57
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:01,075
How long are you acting captain?

58
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,536
Until literally
the second someone else wants the job.

59
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:06,164
- Who killed Galavan?
- Which time?

60
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:11,169
Man. Give me Azrael, Galavan,

61
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:13,755
whoever the hell he was,
over those jackals any day.

62
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:18,217
- You need to bring in Hugo Strange.
- Oh, yeah? On what charge?

63
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:20,803
- Since when do you care?
- Since I became acting captain

64
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,057
of the GCPD and the whole damn city's
got me under a microscope.

65
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,184
Besides which, we've been down this road.

66
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:28,686
Strange is smart.
He'll have covered his tracks.

67
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:31,648
It's pointless going into Arkham
unless we know what we're looking for.

68
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,358
We can't get that unless we go in there.

69
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,110
I hear you, brother,
but my hands are tied.

70
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:38,446
Yeah? Well, mine aren't.

71
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:41,574
Well, enjoy it,
because that's a luxury I don't have!

72
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:48,873
<i>Detective Gordon.</i>

73
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,709
I was hoping you'd be here.

74
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:54,462
Bruce, you gotta stop
calling me detective.

75
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:56,506
What is it?

76
00:04:56,673 --> 00:05:00,218
Selina. Hugo Strange has Selina.

77
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:09,227
<i>Regarding last night's
nocturnal activities,</i>

78
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:12,814
<i>the suspect calling himself Azrael</i>

79
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:16,734
<i>led a one-man assault upon Wayne Manor,</i>

80
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,446
<i>whereupon an altercation ensued

81
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:21,739
<i>Yes.</i>

82
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:25,576
Strange is losing control.
We need to gather the court.

83
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,453
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

84
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,101
<i>We have a heartbeat.</i>

85
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:51,477
He's waking up.

86
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:56,566
Oh.

87
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:58,776
Oh.

88
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:04,949
Look at me.

89
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:11,497
Good morning, son.
You're all right. I'm here.

90
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:16,169
Can you tell me who you are?

91
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:20,423
Can you tell me your name?

92
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:23,134
Who am I?

93
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:26,679
What is my name?

94
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:36,105
Yeah.

95
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:40,234
<i>Amazing.</i>

96
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:43,654
The Octopod DNA we introduced

97
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:46,824
provides exactly the effect
I was looking for.

98
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:50,578
<i>Rest now, son.</i>

99
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,834
I'll return momentarily.
To tell you who you are.

100
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:03,174
What happened to me?

101
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:08,179
That's the seventh subject you've woken up
in the past 12 hours.

102
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,766
I assume he, like the others,
has no memory of his previous life.

103
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:12,934
Yes.

104
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:16,979
Perhaps the trauma of rebirth is simply
too much for the human mind to process.

105
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,440
- You're not worried.
- Should I be?

106
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:22,360
Professor, our employers
are going to shut us down.

107
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:23,861
You must know this.

108
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:27,365
What I know is what we've accomplished.
We've woken the dead.

109
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:31,202
And yet, none have returned
with their memory intact.

110
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:32,870
A tedious point.

111
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:38,876
What's more preferable than giving them
personas that we design and control?

112
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,923
An argument lost on our employers who care
about one thing and one thing only.

113
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,219
You cannot order scientific discoveries
the way you order a steak, Ethel.

114
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:53,724
Now, let's try subject 13, shall we?

115
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:08,739
<i>How could you do this,
Master Bruce?</i>

116
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,784
I strictly forbid you
from involving that little girl, didn't I?

117
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:13,077
I know.

118
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,580
But Selina's always handled herself.
I was sure.

119
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:16,873
But you were wrong, weren't you?

120
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,500
Well, it's different if you choose to be
involved in something like this,

121
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,335
but you actively involved Selina Kyle.

122
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,921
You put your own concerns
in front of that girl's safety.

123
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:25,673
You're bang out of order!

124
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,011
I'm really disappointed in you,
Master Bruce.

125
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:34,348
You're sure she's still there?

126
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,768
Yes. She wouldn't have missed
our meeting otherwise.

127
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,437
Strange must be
holding her prisoner in Arkham.

128
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:40,980
Only I doubt she's in Arkham.

129
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:44,692
I wager Strange has her in the secret lab
where he created Azrael.

130
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:47,695
But Strange runs Arkham.
He's seen there every day.

131
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:49,989
The lab must be accessed through Arkham.

132
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:52,200
- You're thinking it's underground.
- It has to be.

133
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:55,369
There must be stairs, an elevator,
ventilation shafts.

134
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:59,540
- I just don't know how to find them.
- I may have a solution.

135
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:03,628
The technology Strange is using to create
these monsters must be very advanced.

136
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:08,007
My guess is he's using plutonium isotopes
to mutate cell structure.

137
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:10,426
If so, there'll be trace radiation.

138
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:13,137
At Wayne Enterprises,
I developed a miniature Geiger counter

139
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:14,347
for battlefield use.

140
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:17,225
Get me into Arkham,
and I'll find the entrance to that lab.

141
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:21,812
Wayne Foundation
gives the asylum money every year.

142
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,147
I'll ask for a tour.

143
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:25,441
From the man that ordered
the assassination of your father?

144
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:31,781
He'll wanna find out what we know.

145
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:33,908
And he won't see me
and Lucius as a threat.

146
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:35,159
No.

147
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:38,412
Absolutely bloody not. You're not to walk
straight into a lion's den.

148
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,623
I can't even go to back you up
with a leg like this, can I?

149
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,293
Alfred, you said yourself that it's
my fault what happened to Selina Kyle.

150
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:46,545
That means it's my responsibility
to make it right.

151
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:50,007
And I may not be the man
you choose as second in a street fight,

152
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,677
but anything I can do
to protect Bruce, I will.

153
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:55,513
Still, it's half a plan, isn't it?

154
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,140
I mean, just say that Lucius
can get you in there,

155
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,643
and you find the entrance
to the laboratory, then what?

156
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,852
<i>They tell me.</i>

157
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,731
I call Bullock, he comes busting in
with a hundred cops, keeps Strange busy.

158
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:08,150
- I find Selina.
- I see.

159
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:11,529
And how exactly do you plan on getting in?

160
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:13,197
I mean, these two, possibly, but you?

161
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:16,033
I mean, Strange won't let you
within a bloody mile of the place.

162
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:21,163
If I can get you inside the gate,
can you manage the rest of the way?

163
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,707
Yeah, I think I can.

164
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:30,006
The cuttlefish is a fascinating creature.
Able to regenerate brain cells,

165
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:36,512
secrete toxins from its skin,
and its DNA meshes so well with human.

166
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:39,223
<i>I can't wait to see it in action.</i>

167
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,226
Oh, I want to increase voltage
to her cortex.

168
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:45,604
- Two hundred percent.
- Are you certain, sir?

169
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:48,399
It'll be like she's being struck
by a bolt of lightning.

170
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,027
Well, how much more damage
could we possibly do?

171
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:52,737
She's dead.

172
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,284
I'll see you when you wake, my dear.

173
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:23,976
I'm so pleased you two are getting along.

174
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:29,940
I should warn you, Mr. Nygma,
Mr. Stirk has been known to eat people.

175
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:34,236
But he's promised to stop that,
haven't you, Mr. Stirk?

176
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:37,948
You have to get me out of here!

177
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,076
<i>Are you asking for a favor?</i>

178
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:43,746
You should have considered that
before you decided to escape.

179
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:47,666
How are you gonna stop Jim Gordon?

180
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:50,252
What?

181
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:54,632
Jim Gordon and the GCPD
have been here twice in the last week.

182
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,386
- It's obvious that they know.
- Obvious they know what?

183
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,012
Do I really have to say it?

184
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,766
You're making monsters in the basement!

185
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:06,477
- I'm hungry!
- Quiet, Stirk.

186
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:09,980
Monsters in the basement?

187
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:14,860
- You are insane, Mr. Nygma.
- Obviously.

188
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:19,073
Jim Gordon is coming and you're gonna
need all the help that you can get.

189
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,200
So why don't you go tell Strange

190
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:23,327
that if he wants to stop Gordon
and the GCPD,

191
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:24,537
then he's gonna need my help.

192
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,331
Now!

193
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:42,054
We have a heartbeat.

194
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,983
<i>She's awake. She's awake.</i>

195
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:57,403
<i>Quickly, go get Professor Strange.</i>

196
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:01,532
Mr. Fox is pulling up, up front.

197
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,203
I've told Gordon if I don't hear
from you within an hour,

198
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,539
I'm gonna go straight to Bullock.

199
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,793
I have to do this, Alfred.

200
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:16,130
- I don't have a choice.
- Of course you got a choice.

201
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,966
In the same way I can choose
to let you go with my blessing,

202
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,177
and tell you to bring
that little girl home safe.

203
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,845
Or I can take you right now,

204
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:26,182
I can stick you on an airplane
and fly you somewhere very far away.

205
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,516
- You can't.
- Don't be such a plonker.

206
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,185
Of course I can.

207
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:31,979
But I won't.

208
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:36,108
You see, for the past two years,
Master Bruce,

209
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,569
all I've tried to do is protect you
and keep you safe,

210
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,488
thinking that's what your father wanted.

211
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:44,158
But you're not the same boy
he left behind, are you?

212
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,912
So, I have to ask myself,

213
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,999
what would Thomas Wayne do
if he were here?

214
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,295
Your father took responsibility
for his actions.

215
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:59,381
He fought very hard
for what he believed in.

216
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:04,303
And I will not stop you
from doing the same thing.

217
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,598
So.

218
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,101
Off you go.

219
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:15,105
Gordon and Mr. Fox
will be waiting for you.

220
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:42,550
Welcome back to the world, my dear.

221
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:46,428
I imagine you're feeling rather confused.

222
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:51,392
Can you tell me who you are?

223
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,146
Do you remember your name?

224
00:14:57,982 --> 00:14:59,316
<i>Anything?</i>

225
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:06,532
You are a war goddess.

226
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:09,910
<i>- Your name is Andrast...</i>
- No.

227
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:13,455
No?

228
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:17,668
My name is Fish Mooney.

229
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:20,713
I'm sorry.

230
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,883
Could you please repeat that?

231
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:28,512
I said my name is Fish Mooney, bitch.

232
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:32,891
And you better tell me
what the hell is going on.

233
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:47,615
<i>You're making a mistake
keeping me locked in here.</i>

234
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,785
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

235
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:57,875
What allowed her to come back
with her memories intact?

236
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:59,209
It's too soon to tell.

237
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,211
- Perhaps it was the increased voltage.
- Hmm.

238
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:05,049
Something unique about the cuttlefish DNA
we spliced with her own.

239
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,551
And then again,
she was pulled from that filthy river.

240
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:10,679
Perhaps a contaminant from the water
altered the process.

241
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:14,016
Early readings have detected abnormalities
in her brain function.

242
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:17,144
Yes, she may reveal abilities.

243
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:21,065
The most important thing is that she knows
who she is. Our masters will be pleased.

244
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,902
We've created the first true reanimant.

245
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,906
Have you made a decision
about Mr. Nygma's offer?

246
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,241
Oh, yes. Let's let him have a go,
shall we?

247
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,577
He was clever enough
to find his way to the basement.

248
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:36,914
And he does have a point.
He knows Jim Gordon.

249
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:42,294
I'll tell him.

250
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:45,089
Bruce Wayne is at the front gate
asking for you.

251
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:48,258
And he has someone
from Wayne Enterprises with him.

252
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,760
Bold move.

253
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,055
I'm more and more impressed with this boy.

254
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:54,765
Shall I tell him you're not here?

255
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:58,644
On the contrary,
I very much want to speak with him.

256
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,381
Hugo Strange, at your service.

257
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,299
- Lucius Fox.
- Mr. Fox.

258
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,261
And of course, you are...

259
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:33,971
Bruce Wayne.

260
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:38,267
I can't tell you
what it means to finally meet you.

261
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,644
Your father was very dear to me.

262
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:44,189
<i>What happened to him and your mother
was indeed a great tragedy.</i>

263
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,443
Please accept my condolences,
belated as they may be.

264
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:54,950
Thank you.

265
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:58,245
So, how can I be of help?

266
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:01,457
It goes without saying that the work
we do here would not be possible

267
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,834
without the support
of the Wayne Foundation.

268
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,295
The asylum was a cause
close to my parents' hearts.

269
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:09,673
As such, I believe it is my duty to see
how their money is being spent.

270
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,675
So, this is bit of an inspection.

271
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:14,845
No, nothing so formal.
We were just hoping for a look around.

272
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,848
We don't normally give tours.

273
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,934
Even to someone who provides
a quarter of your operating budget?

274
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:26,690
Of course, we can make exceptions.
I'd be happy to be your guide.

275
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,609
Actually, I thought
that you and I could talk,

276
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:31,111
while Mr. Fox looks around.
He's very discreet.

277
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:34,615
I see. You've come armed with a plan.

278
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,952
I'm afraid we can't allow civilians
to wander about,

279
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,998
but perhaps my assistant, Ms. Peabody,
could accompany Mr. Fox.

280
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,542
That's fine, I'll just get my coat.

281
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,921
Mr. Wayne, if you will.

282
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:02,184
Bruce is going with Strange to his office,
while I get the tour.

283
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,770
I see anything, I'll mark it with this.

284
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:08,857
You're clear.

285
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,419
This is expired.

286
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:32,047
Yeah, I lost my new one.
Keep meaning to have it replaced.

287
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,217
Do it today.

288
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,276
This is our rec room.

289
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:56,446
Where our inmates
work on their socialization skills.

290
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:00,534
Who, um, designed the uniforms?

291
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,370
Do you have much training
in mental health, Mr. Fox?

292
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,080
None. None at all.

293
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:07,124
- Shall we continue?
- Yes.

294
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:31,982
Bruce, as much as I value the opportunity
to finally meet you,

295
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:35,235
perhaps we could address
the real reason for your visit.

296
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,154
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

297
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:42,367
Well, you see, the other day,
James Gordon came to see me.

298
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:46,622
He asked about a project that your father
and I worked on a decade ago.

299
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,291
I was led to believe
that he was acting on your behalf.

300
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,293
Is that not why you're here?

301
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,837
After he left the GCPD,

302
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,173
I retained Mr. Gordon
to look into my parents' deaths.

303
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,469
He's been pursuing various leads,
and he doesn't share everything with me.

304
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:05,098
If he overstepped or caused some offense,
you have my apologies.

305
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,184
Thank you.

306
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,979
And I can understand how you want answers.

307
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:14,775
How difficult it must be to accept
that something so horrific,

308
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:19,279
<i>as the murder of one's own parents
could be a random and meaningless act.</i>

309
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:24,618
So, you want a reason. Someone to blame.

310
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,539
In their case,
I think there was someone to blame.

311
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:31,541
Oh, so do I.

312
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:35,963
Sugar?

313
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:53,814
Arkham Asylum has been open before
the days of water cures and trepanning.

314
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:57,526
That's boring a hole in the skull
to release bad humors.

315
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,945
We don't do that anymore.

316
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,698
- What is that?
- Oh.

317
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,659
This measures air quality.

318
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,369
Microparticles.

319
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:11,081
Mr. Wayne is concerned that the patients
are in a healthy environment.

320
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,916
Asthma and whatnot.

321
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:16,253
You're doing good so far.

322
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:17,921
I'm so relieved.

323
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:19,840
This way.

324
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:53,915
<i>- Mr. Fox?</i>
- Yep.

325
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,002
Coming.

326
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,588
You remind me of him.

327
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,049
Thomas.

328
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:04,551
<i>You have that same look in your eyes.</i>

329
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:07,554
- What look is that?
<i>- Certainty.</i>

330
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:11,016
As a scientist,
that's a luxury that I cannot afford.

331
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:14,728
No, in science, there must always be
some doubt, but not with Thomas. No.

332
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:16,813
Thomas believed in things.

333
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,110
I think what you're referring to
is moral principles.

334
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:23,320
Yes.

335
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:28,867
Sadly, science and moral absolutes
do not make easy bedfellows.

336
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:33,497
Oh, the arguments we used to have.
I could never make him listen.

337
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,832
I'm glad to hear that.

338
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,709
Are you?

339
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,670
<i>Haven't you ever imagined the life</i>

340
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:44,216
that might have been
if your father hadn't been so certain?

341
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,176
If he had listened?

342
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,428
Then he wouldn't have been the man he was.

343
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:50,764
True.

344
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:53,600
But he wouldn't be dead, either.

345
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,727
Along with your mother.

346
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:59,564
Are those ideals
that your father cherished so worth it?

347
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:04,361
Wouldn't you gladly trade everything
you believe for one more day,

348
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:07,531
one more hour with your parents alive?

349
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:16,832
So, you admit it then?
You admit what you did?

350
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:23,547
Here's what I admit, Bruce.

351
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,966
That I was your father's friend.

352
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,969
That I pleaded with him,
as I plead with you now.

353
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,179
Turn back.

354
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:35,058
Surely you have those that you care about.

355
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:37,727
For their sake, as well as your own,

356
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:42,566
make the choice your father did not.

357
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:26,067
You have been searching
for the man who killed your parents.

358
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:30,071
But the answer has always been
right in front of you.

359
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:34,284
Bruce, your father orphaned you.

360
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:39,039
His actions fired the bullet
that killed him and your mother.

361
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:42,792
He knew what he was doing,
and he did it anyway.

362
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:47,881
I'm begging you not to follow his path.

363
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:58,183
You want to know
if I wish my parents were alive?

364
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:00,936
Of course.

365
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:05,649
Would I give anything
to have them back? Yes.

366
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:10,153
But my father fought and died
for what he believed was right.

367
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,908
And if necessary,

368
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:18,954
so will I.

369
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:32,384
Take them.

370
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:42,477
It seems you are your father's son.

371
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:44,938
I want you to know
how greatly I respect that.

372
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:50,652
Where's Selina Kyle?
What have you done with her?

373
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,665
They got you locked up good in here.

374
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,420
I'm gonna get us out of here, Bridgit.

375
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:10,672
<i>Bruce is gonna find us. Hmm?</i>

376
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,133
We'll get you help.

377
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:49,169
Lunchtime.

378
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:53,048
Where am I?

379
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,341
Huh?

380
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,182
This isn't an island, is it?

381
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:05,435
Hey, lady, I just work here.
You want your lunch?

382
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,939
You wanna make yourself useful?

383
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:13,234
Make me a grilled cheese sandwich.

384
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:39,761
Someone will come
looking for the Wayne boy.

385
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,263
Yes.

386
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:45,809
You like him.

387
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,979
He reminds me of Thomas.

388
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:54,401
Whom I miss, ironic as that might seem.

389
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:57,362
The boy is a threat.
You know what needs to be done.

390
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,155
You don't have much time.

391
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:01,157
<i>You have less than
you imagine.</i>

392
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:05,412
Oh, no.

393
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,914
<i>We need a word, Strange.</i>

394
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,417
Of course, how might I be of service?

395
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,586
<i>First the father, now the son.</i>

396
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,798
<i>You have a habit of
catching the eye of the Wayne family.</i>

397
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:20,135
- Everything is under control.
<i>- So you say.</i>

398
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,554
<i>The fact is,
you've lost sight of your mission.</i>

399
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,642
<i>Sending men with swords into Gotham.
Freaks armed with freeze guns.</i>

400
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:31,896
There have been missteps, I grant you,
but look at all we've accomplished.

401
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,190
<i>We do not care about your monsters.</i>

402
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,444
<i>What do they have to do
with restoring the dead to life?</i>

403
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:42,031
Physical regeneration has always been a
necessary part of bringing back the dead.

404
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,202
I had to resort to any means necessary
to make humans stronger, faster...

405
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:49,873
<i>Be that as it may,
you have failed at your core objective.</i>

406
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,708
That is not true.

407
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:56,671
<i>Immortality means returning to life
with one's mind and memories intact.</i>

408
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:58,548
<i>And you have not.</i>

409
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:00,216
Oh, but I have.

410
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:03,511
<i>- When?</i>
- Today.

411
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:05,722
I brought someone back.

412
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:10,518
Memories, emotion, the soul itself.
Back from death.

413
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,897
<i>- If you're lying...
- I am not.</i>

414
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:18,067
<i>Can you repeat the process?</i>

415
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:22,655
If given time, I believe so.

416
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,574
<i>Very well.</i>

417
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:28,244
<i>Find out what the Wayne boy
and his companions know.</i>

418
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:31,789
<i>Move everything you can
to the facility upstate.</i>

419
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:35,126
<i>Then destroy any evidence of Indian Hill.</i>

420
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:38,421
- By destroy, you mean...
<i>- You have an explosive device.</i>

421
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:39,923
<i>Use it.</i>

422
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,425
<i>Destroy Indian Hill.</i>

423
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,265
What's this?

424
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:51,351
It's a grilled cheese sandwich.

425
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:55,146
You made me a sandwich?

426
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:58,274
Yeah.

427
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:07,951
Why?

428
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:09,619
I don't know.

429
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:11,829
You told me to.

430
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:17,752
Wait.

431
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:39,315
I don't know what to do, Bridgit.

432
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:42,235
It's simple.

433
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:44,988
You can die.

434
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:47,949
Drop it.

435
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:50,577
Don't make me hurt you.

436
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:53,371
You think you can hurt me?

437
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:55,456
I am the Goddess of Fire.

438
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:58,167
You're not the goddess of anything.
You're Bridgit.

439
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:02,171
We grew up together. We're friends.
When my mom left, you took me in.

440
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:03,923
- Goddesses don't have friends.
- Says who?

441
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,508
The Professor.

442
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:08,803
<i>- He told me who I am.</i>
- Screw him.

443
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,684
<i>Remember the pigeons?
How we used to feed them?</i>

444
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:19,480
It's me, Selina. You've gotta remember.

445
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:24,360
I...

446
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:33,202
Cale flamed up good,
but Joe burned the brightest.

447
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:37,624
Okay. Yeah.

448
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:40,209
Yeah, you fried your brothers.

449
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:43,880
Not the memory I was hoping for,
but it's something.

450
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,217
You'll burn bright.

451
00:32:49,844 --> 00:32:51,054
I know it.

452
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:53,222
No, no.

453
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,319
I am Firefly.

454
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:09,572
Fire cannot touch me.

455
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:11,741
Oh, crap.

456
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:16,079
You're the Goddess of Fire, right?

457
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:17,872
Right?

458
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:20,083
Goddesses have servants and stuff.

459
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:22,502
Let me be your servant.

460
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:30,301
Why do I need a servant?

461
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:32,929
You can't be a goddess without a servant.

462
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:38,017
Come on, it's totally part of the story.
The Professor just forgot to tell you.

463
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:41,187
<i>You gotta have a servant.</i>

464
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:43,356
I guess that's true.

465
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:45,441
Hello.

466
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:54,867
Oh, man.

467
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:58,287
Double shifts until I say otherwise.

468
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:01,582
And I want everyone in a uniform
out on the streets.

469
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:02,792
Bullock!

470
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:07,797
Gordon, Master Bruce and Fox
are still in Arkham.

471
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:09,799
They should be out by now.
They're in trouble.

472
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:11,134
That son of a bitch!

473
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:15,346
- Jim Gordon, I mean. He's forcing my hand.
- Are you listening to me?

474
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:17,807
Grab your gun, your badge,
and your bits and your bobs and let's go.

475
00:34:17,974 --> 00:34:19,058
Hold on a second, okay?

476
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:21,310
You're talking about a place
that's built like a fortress.

477
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,187
Chockablock with armed guards.

478
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:25,481
Now, while we could send in
an assault force

479
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:29,277
of a pudgy middle-aged Irish detective
and a recently-stabbed Englishman,

480
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:34,198
I think the Acting Captain of the GCPD
could do a little better.

481
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:42,498
Right. Go get our guys.

482
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:44,167
Bravo Team, on me.

483
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:59,015
- Lucius.
- Bruce, are you okay?

484
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:01,309
- I'm fine. Where's Gordon?
- I haven't seen him.

485
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:05,688
I'm sorry I got you into this, Lucius.

486
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,525
It seems likely
we're all going to die in here.

487
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:10,735
Don't say that.

488
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:13,654
I don't mind dying.

489
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:17,867
I mind that I got you and Jim Gordon
and Selina Kyle involved.

490
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:19,243
Bruce.

491
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,828
You are a remarkable young man,

492
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:22,580
but you didn't force any of us
to do anything.

493
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:24,040
We chose.

494
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:31,756
Hugo Strange said that all this time
I've been searching for the man

495
00:35:31,923 --> 00:35:33,758
who killed my parents,

496
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:38,930
when really, it was my own father.

497
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:44,602
That he knew what he was doing.

498
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:50,775
That I am my father's son.

499
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:55,238
Bruce, your father had the courage
to fight for what he believed in.

500
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,282
And as long as there is life,
there is hope.

501
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:01,035
<i>Touching sentiment.</i>

502
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:03,037
Who are you? Where's Jim Gordon?

503
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:08,251
Hmm, yeah.

504
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:11,212
I would urge you to worry
about yourselves right now.

505
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:14,173
Jim Gordon has his own problems.

506
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:17,468
Strange, you son of a bitch!

507
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,804
Where's Bruce Wayne? If you've hurt him...

508
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:21,430
Bruce Wayne is alive.

509
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:23,057
For now.

510
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:25,935
Try me, and that may change.

511
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:28,187
You won't get away with this.

512
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:31,232
People know we're here.
They're already on their way to stop you.

513
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:34,110
Yes, and I'm afraid
I simply can't allow that.

514
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:36,946
The work that I'm doing here
is too important

515
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:38,614
and at too critical a juncture.

516
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:40,324
But fortunately,

517
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:42,618
a solution has presented itself.

518
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:43,911
Gentlemen.

519
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,544
- What are you doing?
- Hold still.

520
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:08,811
The solution is very important.
You mustn't spill a drop.

521
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:19,614
<i>So, here's the situation.</i>

522
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:22,742
Professor Strange has tasked me
with finding out

523
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:25,661
how much you two know
about what he's been up to.

524
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:28,539
And more importantly, who you told.

525
00:37:29,332 --> 00:37:31,500
Show us Jim Gordon and Selina Kyle.

526
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:35,504
<i>I think you're not quite grasping
the power dynamic here, turtleneck.</i>

527
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:41,594
As I was saying,
we need to know what you know.

528
00:37:42,845 --> 00:37:44,805
And you're gonna tell me.

529
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:49,268
<i>Or poison gas will spew
from the nozzles above your head</i>

530
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,354
<i>and you will both die very,</i>

531
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:53,689
very painfully.

532
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:58,444
I know this voice. He worked for the GCPD.

533
00:37:58,611 --> 00:38:00,363
<i>He had a funny kind of name.</i>

534
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:03,282
There's nothing funny about my name.

535
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:04,951
He was the one that framed Jim Gordon.

536
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:09,664
You always were a smart cookie, Foxy.

537
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:12,917
<i>Do you know why Strange gave me this job?</i>

538
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:16,963
<i>It's because he knows that I would
kill you both and not bat an eye.</i>

539
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,216
So, keeping that in mind,

540
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:23,302
<i>five minutes on the clock.</i>

541
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:25,137
Starting...

542
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,139
Now.

543
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:33,646
Fun.

544
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:47,284
- What the hell was that?
- You'll see.

545
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:50,579
Allow me to introduce Basil.

546
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,873
Basil just woke up this morning,
didn't you, son?

547
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:54,250
Yep.

548
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,502
He was confused, poor soul.

549
00:38:56,711 --> 00:39:00,756
He had forgotten who he was,
until I reminded him of his great talent.

550
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:03,259
You see, Basil is a gifted performer.

551
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:06,637
A chameleon of sorts.
Would you like to see?

552
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:10,683
You belong in your own asylum, Strange.

553
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,061
And you, James Gordon, belong in the past.

554
00:39:15,021 --> 00:39:16,689
The world has moved on.

555
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:21,819
While you and others like you
were living your sad, normal lives,

556
00:39:21,986 --> 00:39:24,739
I was pushing the boundaries of evolution.

557
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:30,786
The future belongs to my children
and that future is here.

558
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:57,605
<i>Inbound to Arkham Asylum.
Strike force ready.</i>

559
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:01,692
<i>Tell me what you know.</i>

560
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:49,240
Astonishing.

561
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:58,290
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

562
00:40:58,457 --> 00:40:59,750
The finishing touch.

563
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:08,217
Introduce yourself, son.

564
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:09,510
Nice to meet you.

565
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:11,971
What the hell?

566
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:13,597
Nice to meet you.

567
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:17,226
- You son of a bitch!
- Son of a bitch.

568
00:41:17,685 --> 00:41:18,894
Nice to meet you.

569
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:20,896
I'm Jim Gordon.

570
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:05,858
English - SDH
