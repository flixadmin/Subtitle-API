1
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,630
Your Grace, I want to say...

2
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,089
You will not speak.

3
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,677
How do I know you are who you say you are?

4
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,305
If only I were otherwise.

5
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,308
If you are Tyrion Lannister,
why shouldn't I kill you

6
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,977
to pay your family back
for what it did to mine?

7
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,563
You want revenge against the Lannisters?

8
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,150
I killed my mother, Joanna Lannister,
on the day I was born.

9
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,820
I killed my father, Tywin Lannister,
with a bolt to the heart.

10
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,740
I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.

11
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,992
So I should welcome you into my service

12
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,203
because you murdered members
of your own family?

13
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,456
Into your service?

14
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,584
We have only just met.

15
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,379
It's too soon to know
if you deserve my service.

16
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:54,466
If you'd rather return to the fighting pits,
just say the word.

17
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,055
When I was a young man, I heard a story

18
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,974
about a baby born
during the worst storm in living memory.

19
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,479
She had no wealth, no lands, no army,
only a name

20
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,065
and a handful of supporters,
most of whom probably thought

21
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,859
they could use that name
to benefit themselves.

22
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,445
They kept her alive,
moving her from place to place,

23
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,407
often hours ahead
of the men who'd been sent to kill her.

24
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,785
She was eventually sold off to some warlord
on the edge of the world

25
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,662
and that appeared to be that.

26
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:28,333
Then, a few years later,
the most well-informed person I knew

27
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,253
told me that this girl
without wealth, lands, or armies

28
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,715
had somehow acquired all three
in a very short span of time,

29
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,550
along with three dragons.

30
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,846
He thought she was our best,
last chance to build a better world.

31
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,642
I thought you were worth meeting,
at the very least.

32
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,394
And why are you worth meeting?

33
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,396
Why should I spend my time listening to you?

34
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,149
Because you cannot build
a better world on your own.

35
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,069
You have no one at your side
who understands the land you want to rule,

36
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,072
the strengths and weaknesses of the houses
that will either join or oppose you.

37
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,324
I will have a very large army.

38
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,577
And very large dragons.

39
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,163
Killing and politics
aren't always the same thing.

40
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,417
When I served as Hand of the King,
I did quite well with the latter,

41
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,793
considering the king in question

42
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:15,172
preferred torturing animals
to leading his people.

43
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,176
I could do an even better job
advising a ruler worth the name.

44
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,636
If that is indeed what you are.

45
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,306
So you want to advise me?

46
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,185
Very well.

47
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,521
What would you have me do with him?

48
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,401
I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.

49
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,779
I know.

50
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,952
Why should the people trust a queen
who can't keep her promises?

51
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,250
Whomever Ser Jorah was
when he started informing on you,

52
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,169
he is no longer that man.

53
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,714
I can't remember ever seeing a sane man
as devoted to anything

54
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,508
as he is to serving you.

55
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,594
He claims he would kill for you
and die for you

56
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,680
and nothing I have witnessed
gives me reason to doubt him.

57
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,561
And yet he did betray you.

58
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,827
Did he have an opportunity
to confess his betrayal?

59
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,245
Yes.

60
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,081
Many opportunities.

61
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,751
TYRION: And did he?
DAENERYS: No.

62
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,088
Not until forced to do so.

63
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,178
He worships you.

64
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,346
He is in love with you, I think.

65
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,016
But he did not trust you with the truth.

66
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,436
An unpleasant truth to be sure,
but one of great significance to you.

67
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,524
He did not trust that you
would be wise enough to forgive him.

68
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,485
So I should kill him?

69
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:05,824
A ruler who kills those devoted to her
is not a ruler who inspires devotion.

70
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,661
And you're going to need to inspire devotion,
a lot of it,

71
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,706
if you're ever going to rule
across the Narrow Sea.

72
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:17,502
But you cannot have him by your side
when you do.

73
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,801

00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,791
I wish you had said it sooner.

162
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,670
Is there any word from Jaime?

163
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,006
No, I'm afraid not.

164
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,474
Grand Maester Pycelle

165
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,187
has summoned your Uncle Kevan
back from Casterly Rock

166
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,938
to serve as Hand of the King.

167
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,566
He now presides over the Small Council.

168
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,362
Tell him I need to speak to him.

169
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,739
I implored him to visit you, but he would not.

170
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,120
What about my son, the king?

171
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,374
If you can visit me, then surely the king...

172
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,709
Your arrest and Queen Margaery's arrest...

173
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,211
The king has not taken them well.

174
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,046
He remains in his chambers.

175
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,257
His servants often find his food
in the hall, left untouched.

176
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,551
You need to talk to him.

177
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,720
You need to talk to my son
and tell him to come and see me,

178
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,971
come and see his mother.

179
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,725
He... I tried. He wouldn't see me.

180
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,519
He won't see anyone.

181
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,271
I can't stay here.

182
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,609
There is a way.

183
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,948
A way out.

184
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,618
Confess?

185
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,206
To the High Sparrow? I won't.

186
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,084
I made him.

187
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,254
I rose him up from nothing.

188
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,006
I will not kneel before
some barefooted commoner

189
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,716
and beg his forgiveness.

190
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,351
Goodbye.

191
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,521
The work continues.

192
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,225
Why?

193
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,896
Why, Theon?

194
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,232
Not Theon. There is no Theon.

195
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,650
- Reek.
- Reek.

196
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,986
Why did you tell him, Reek?

197
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,072
I was helping you.

198
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,033
You wanted to escape.

199
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,743
There is no escape.

200
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,370
Not ever.

201
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,582
Theon Greyjoy tried to escape.

202
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,919
The master knew.

203
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,421
He knows everything.

204
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,426
He hunted him and caught him
and strapped him to a cross

205
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:55,598
and cut away piece after piece
until there was no Theon left.

206
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,521
Good.

207
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,944
If it weren't for you, I'd still have a family.

208
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,696
If I could do what Ramsay did to you

209
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,950
right here, right now, I would.

210
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,498
I deserved everything.

211
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,460
I deserve to be Reek.

212
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,797
I did terrible things.

213
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,634
Turned on Robb.

214
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,262
Captured Winterfell.

215
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,765
- Killed those boys.
- They weren't "those boys."

216
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,101
They were Bran and Rickon.
They were your brothers.

217
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,727
You'd known them since they were born.

218
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,187
They weren't. They were only...

219
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,313
Only what?

220
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,024
- I can't.
- Tell me.

221
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,568
I can't, not unless the master says.

222
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:49,819
- Tell me. They weren't what?
- They weren't...

223
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:54,282
Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be gone
while you still breathe the air.

224
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,410
Tell me to my face, Theon.
Tell me that they weren't your brothers!

225
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,995
They weren't Bran and Rickon!

226
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,957
I couldn't find them.

227
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,674
It was two farm boys.

228
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,806
I killed them and burned them
so no one would know.

229
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,895
You didn't...

230
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,608
Do you know where they went,
Bran and Rickon?

231
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,650
I can't talk to you anymore.

232
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,111
Theon, you have to tell me.
Do you have any idea where...

233
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,363
Not Theon! Reek!

234
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,658
(DOOR SLAMS)

235
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:43,164
Our scouts tell us
he's got no more than 6,000 men.

236
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,166
More than half of those
are mounted, however.

237
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,460
And how high do Stannis' horses jump?

238
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,381
Our walls have been fully repaired.
The gates have been reinforced.

239
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,676
We have enough food for six months.

240
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,804
We are more prepared for a siege
than they could ever be.

241
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:05,227
All we have to do is wait for them
to freeze, starve, and mutiny.

242
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,649
You disagree?

243
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:13,194
Stannis isn't from the North. You are, Father.

244
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:17,156
I think you're missing an opportunity
to show the people of the North

245
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,950
how House Bolton treats southern invaders.

246
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,160
And what do you recommend?

247
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,912
That we not sit and wait for Stannis to decide

248
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,122
what sort of fight this is going to be.

249
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:29,335
That we hit first and hit hard
and leave a feast for the crows.

250
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,463
A smart commander does not
abandon a defensive advantage.

251
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,175
As long as we stay behind these walls,
they can't touch us.

252
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,927
Not to mention that the snow is so deep,

253
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,097
we couldn't get an army through
to engage them even if we wanted to.

254
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,015
I don't need an army.

255
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,976
I need 20 good men.

256
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,861
So, have you decided yet?

257
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,114
Whether I'm worthy of your service?

258
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,869
Have you decided yet
whether you're going to have me killed?

259
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,871
It's probably my safest option.

260
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,793
I could see why you would think so.

261
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,295
It's what your father would have done.

262
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,840
And what would your father have done?

263
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:22,096
My father, who publically
sentenced me to death?

264
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,599
I'd say his thoughts on having me killed
were abundantly clear.

265
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:26,809
Is that why you killed him?

266
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,274
Someday, if you decide not to execute me,

267
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,026
I'll tell you all about why I killed my father.

268
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,529
And on that day, should it ever come,

269
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,449
we'll need more wine than this.

270
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,244
I know what my father was.

271
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,788
What he did.

272
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,875
I know the Mad King earned his name.

273
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,380
So, here we sit.

274
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,842
Two terrible children of two terrible fathers.

275
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,594
I'm terrible?

276
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,012
I've heard stories.

277
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,181
Why did you travel to the far side of the world

278
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,099
to meet someone terrible?

279
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,101
To see if you were the right kind of terrible.

280
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,269
Which kind is that?

281
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,314
The kind that prevents your people
from being even more so.

282
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,026
Well, I did reopen the fighting pits.

283
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,904
Under my rule, murder will once again
become entertainment.

284
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,822
Yes, that was wise.

285
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:25,075
And you agreed to marry someone you loathe
for the greater good.

286
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,243
Very impressive.

287
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,831
My own sister married someone
she loathed as well,

288
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,082
though not by choice,

289
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,294
and certainly not for the greater good,
gods forbid.

290
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,754
She ended up having him killed.

291
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,217
Perhaps it won't come to that.

292
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,727
It's not impossible that Varys was right
about you after all.

293
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,814
Varys? King Robert's spymaster?

294
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,399
Yes, he's the one who convinced me
to come find you.

295
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,488
He was my traveling companion,
before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.

296
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,698
Jorah sent my secrets to Varys.

297
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:09,078
For 20 years, the spider
oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.

298
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,831
He did what he had to do to survive.

299
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:15,000
He did a lot of other things as well,
things he didn't have to do.

300
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,712
I suspect he's the main reason
you weren't slaughtered in your crib.

301
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,132
- But you trust him?
- Yes, oddly.

302
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,094
He may be the only person in the world I trust.

303
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,471
Except my brother.

304
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,849
The brother who killed my father?

305
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,559
That's the one.

306
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,519
Perhaps I will have you killed after all.

307
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,104
Your queenly prerogative.

308
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,775
I had given up on life

309
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,279
until Varys convinced me
you might be worth living for.

310
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:48,033
You chop off my head, well,
my final days were interesting.

311
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,417
I'm not going to kill you.

312
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,004
No?

313
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,464
- Banish me?
- No.

314
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,010
So if I'm not going to be murdered
and I'm not going to be banished...

315
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,595
You're going to advise me.

316
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,724
While you can still speak
in complete sentences.

317
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,647
- Advise you on what?
- How to get what I want.

318
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,482
The Iron Throne.

319
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,236
Perhaps you should try
wanting something else.

320
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,906
If I want jokes, I'll get myself a proper fool.

There's more to the world than Westeros.

How many hundreds of thousands of lives
have you changed for the better here?

324
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:39,585
Perhaps this is where you belong,
where you can do the most good.

325
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,715
I fought so that no child
born into Slaver's Bay

326
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,843
would ever know what it meant
to be bought or sold.

327
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,804
I will continue that fight here and beyond.

328
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,307
But this is not my home.

329
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,101
When you get back to your home,
who supports you?

330
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,686
The common people.

331

Let's be generous
and assume that's going to happen.

332
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,608
Here in Slaver's Bay,
you had the support of the common people

333
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,902
and only the common people.

334

is alive to support you.

Our two terrible fathers saw to that.

339
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:22,086
The remaining members of House Lannister
will never back you, not ever.

340
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,755
Stannis Baratheon won't back you, either.

It's a beautiful dream, stopping the wheel.

You're not the first person
who's ever dreamt it.

00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,244
I'm not going to stop the wheel.
