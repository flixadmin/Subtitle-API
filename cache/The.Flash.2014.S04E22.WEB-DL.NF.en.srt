He'll charge the satellites.

You're looking at motion-

You hit one of those,

Genius idea,

00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,036
if their placement didn't
randomize every couple hours.

278
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,498

his battery for 12 hours,

jump into a pocket dimension,

00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,962
and he's out of there.

282

- What if I don't
avoid the plates?

283
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,301
What if I hit 'em?
All of 'em.

284
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,428
I'm serious. I mean,
if I go into Flash Time,

285
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,054
I could use each plate's
electric current

286
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,848
as a fuel source.
Then I'd be fast enough

287
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,682
to follow DeVoe into
his pocket dimension.

288

a serious boost.

if hitting the plates didn't
cause an electrical explosion.

291

00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,984

be focusing on feelings.

00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,116
Well, they kind of taught me
that if you wanna...

369
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,535
if you wanna follow
DeVoe's actions

370
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,578
you gotta focus
on DeVoe's motives.

371
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,706
Which is basically
DeVoe's feelings,

372
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:36,000
and so feelings,
if you're Marlize DeVoe...

feel safe?

we can't split up in A.R.G.U.S.

the whole time.

- Have you guys been
researching me?

399
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,905
- At first we thought you
were vibrating our molecules

400
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,322
when we were in Flash Time,
but that didn't

401
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,616
explain why we were conscious.

- Which gave us
this brain blast.

403

When you run, you don't
just tap into the Speed Force.

404
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,623
You generate Speed Force
around you.

from the friction

Like an aura.

408
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,462
- So when I bring you
into Flash Time

409
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,339
I'm actually extending
my Speed Force aura to you.

410
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,175
- And what if physical touch
just focuses those powers?

411
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,220
- I could let go.
Share my speed.

412
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,472

a few moments

Like 55 milliseconds

416
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,270

to rescue the hostages

As we get closer
to your due date,

He warned me he wasn't ready.

But I pushed him anyway.
I said go back out there

My burden.

We gave Ralph his powers.

You wanna talk about burdens.
I started this.

I shot that bazooka.
I opened up the Speed Force,

781
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,058

so you can stand here

782
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,811
and tell me you're going
to save the world alone again.

783
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:15,355
