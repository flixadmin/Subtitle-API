While the threat above us
grows undeniably...

301
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:01,400
Violence has always
plagued the surface.

302
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:03,634
They will destroy themselves.

303
00:27:03,636 --> 00:27:06,470
Not before
destroying us first.

304
00:27:06,472 --> 00:27:09,740
We have been hiding
long enough.

305
00:27:09,742 --> 00:27:13,544
The time has come
for Atlantis to rise again.

<font color="#00ff00">VULKO:</font> We honor you,
King Nereus,

307
00:27:17,116 --> 00:27:20,517
by inviting Xebel
to be the first kingdom

308
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:22,819
to join King Orm's alliance.

309
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:24,655
As if you had a choice, Vulko.

310
00:27:24,657 --> 00:27:26,823
By law, you need
four of the Seven Kingdoms

311
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:28,492
to ascend and attack.

312
00:27:28,494 --> 00:27:30,694
The Lost Nation and the
Deserters have long perished.

313
00:27:30,696 --> 00:27:32,763
The Trench are nothing
but animals.

314
00:27:32,765 --> 00:27:35,399
The Brine will never join you,
and the Fishermen are cowards.

315
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:40,537
Without me and my army to convince
them, your plans are stillborn.

316
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:42,906
But I know
what you really want.

317
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:45,776
Once you've obtained the
pledge of the four kingdoms,

318
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:47,445
you will be ordained

319
00:27:48,581 --> 00:27:49,848
Ocean Master.

320
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:53,316
That is merely a title.

321
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:55,318
I'm no fool, King Orm.

322
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,787
As Ocean Master,
you'll be commander

323
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:59,589
of the greatest military might
on this planet.

324
00:27:59,591 --> 00:28:01,593
I am the natural choice
to lead it.

Are you?

326
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:08,464
What about the rumors
that there's another?

327
00:28:08,466 --> 00:28:12,069
An Atlantean,
living among the surface.

328
00:28:12,071 --> 00:28:14,537
One of royal blood.

329
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:18,441
You may sit on the throne of Atlantis,
but your claim to it is weak.

330
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:20,576
How can you possibly hope
to unite the empire?

331
00:28:20,578 --> 00:28:23,913
My mother's bastard has
never even been to Atlantis.

332

You defeated Steppenwolf

That had nothing to do

Vulko has learned of the location
of the Lost Trident of Atlan.

With the Sacred Trident,

You can then claim your

It died with my mother.

But I promise you this.
If Orm attacks,

I will treat him exactly the

But then, I'm done.

452

Maybe that's for the best.

453

Wait, you can talk underwater?

456
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:50,501
I can talk underwater, too!

457
00:38:50,503 --> 00:38:52,769

than just talk.

459

Being Atlantean means more than
just being able to breathe water.

Your body is equipped to survive

Legally,
he's not allowed to yet.

505

What he did to your surface

506
00:44:46,356 --> 00:44:47,890
What provoked it?

507
00:44:47,892 --> 00:44:51,526
King Orm and your father
were ambushed by the surface.

508
00:44:51,528 --> 00:44:54,162
By the surface?
I don't think so.

509
00:44:54,164 --> 00:44:56,097
They still think
Atlantis is a fairy tale.

510
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:57,799
I was there.

511
00:44:57,801 --> 00:44:59,668
A surface warship fired at us.

512
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:02,404
Now, Xebel sides
with Atlantis,

513
00:45:02,406 --> 00:45:07,309
giving Orm a fleet big enough to force
the other two kingdoms to join him.

514
00:45:07,311 --> 00:45:11,880
If we're going to prevent this
war, you must dethrone him now.

How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't wanna be king.

You don't understand.

517
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:19,421
Once he is named Ocean Master,
it'll be too late.

518
00:45:19,423 --> 00:45:23,157
The power at his disposal will be
unlike anything you have ever seen.

519
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:25,828
I'm from the surface.
No one is gonna take me seriously.

520
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:27,395
Okay? I don't even know
where to begin.

521
00:45:27,397 --> 00:45:29,865
By winning the hearts
and minds of the people

522
00:45:29,867 --> 00:45:34,605
by proving to them that you're
worthy, and retrieving this.

523
00:45:39,509 --> 00:45:40,577
Hmm.

524

Not like this one, you don't.

526
00:45:46,416 --> 00:45:49,084
This is
the Lost Trident of Atlan.

527
00:45:49,086 --> 00:45:50,318
Oh, I know the story.

528
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,821
It's more than a story.
It's real.

529
00:45:53,823 --> 00:45:58,860
<i>It was forged by the greatest
weapon masters in history.</i>

530
00:45:58,862 --> 00:46:02,632
<i>Crafted from Poseidon's steel
for King Atlan,</i>

<i>the first ruler of Atlantis.</i>

532

<i>Legend says the trident was imbued
with the power to command the sea.</i>

533

So what happened to it?

534
00:46:14,077 --> 00:46:17,679
To know that is to go back to
the time before the Great Fall,

535

<i>when King Atlan
ruled over all that was,</i>

<i>when the kingdoms of Atlantis
were one.</i>

<i>at a time when

<i>still thought the earth
was flat.</i>

541
00:46:42,204 --> 00:46:45,405
<i>But we became too ambitious,</i>

542
00:46:45,407 --> 00:46:48,076
<i>too hungry for power.</i>

in a war like this.

603

You have clearly chosen a side and
come here to challenge the throne.

604
00:52:23,076 --> 00:52:25,111
If that's what it takes
to stop your war.

605
00:52:27,181 --> 00:52:30,048
Are you invoking
the Combat of the Kings?

606
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:34,353
Call it whatever you want.
I call it an ass-whooping.

607
00:52:34,355 --> 00:52:36,888
Well then, perhaps
that's how we'll proceed.

608
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:38,656
- Your Majesty!
- Orm, please.

609
00:52:38,658 --> 00:52:40,058
Don't you see?

610
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,093
If I defeat the firstborn son
of Atlanna

611
00:52:42,095 --> 00:52:44,562
in a formal challenge
in front of everyone,

612
00:52:44,564 --> 00:52:49,667
then all Seven Kingdoms will have to
concede that I am the one true king.

613
00:52:49,669 --> 00:52:53,671
Your Majesty, there is no victory
in defeating the ignorant.

614
00:52:53,673 --> 00:52:55,275
Your brother
is clearly an imbecile.

615
00:52:56,943 --> 00:52:59,211
Your Highness,
he doesn't know our ways.

616
00:52:59,213 --> 00:53:01,348
Then he's about to get
an education.

617
00:53:02,883 --> 00:53:04,850
Are you officially
challenging me?

618
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:07,052
Hell yes, I challenge you.
And when I win...

619
00:53:07,054 --> 00:53:08,586
If you win,

620
00:53:08,588 --> 00:53:12,293
I will cease all immediate action.
The war is over.

621
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,761
But if I win...

622
00:53:16,497 --> 00:53:17,697
You're over.

623
00:53:18,466 --> 00:53:19,997

Your mother loved you more

But she had to return to
Atlantis to keep you safe.

657
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:48,679
Her marriage to King Orvax
was arranged a long time ago,

658
00:55:48,681 --> 00:55:50,380
so she had to marry him...

And bear him a son,
Prince Orm.

When Orvax eventually
found out about you,

he became overwhelmed
with jealousy

about the Karathen,

688
00:57:50,769 --> 00:57:55,672
an ancient sea monster so powerful
that even King Atlan himself feared it.

689
00:57:55,674 --> 00:58:00,075
So, he imprisoned it
in the depths of the ocean.

690
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:04,781
And in that abyss, the creature
bides its time waiting to rise again.

Do not deny it.

1177

01:38:59,585 --> 01:39:00,854

He wanted nothing to do with it.
You swore to serve the throne!

1182
01:39:11,764 --> 01:39:12,763
