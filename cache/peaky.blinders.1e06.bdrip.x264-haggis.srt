00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,363
You're much better with him than I am.

170
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,206
He settles quicker with me
because he can't smell the milk.

171
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,130
-(BABY GURGLES)
-You're tired.

172
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,841
Let's put him down.

173
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,922
(AUNT POLLY SHUSHES THE BABY)

174
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,849
Mine were terrors for the tit.

175
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,126
Both of them.

176
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,324
Well, you never knew
my children, did you?

177
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,324
I was a child myself then.

178
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,245
You never talk about them.

179
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,050
I've no reason to.

180
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,923
(BABY COOS)

181
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,809
Heart breaks even when
I think about them.

182
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,321
But, today,

183
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,250
I do have reason to.

184
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,531
Sit down, Ada.

185
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,284
They were three and five years old.

186
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:43,089
Sally was three, Michael was five,
well, two weeks away from being six.

187
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,525
It was Sunday morning,

188
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,251
I was at church...

189
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,605
"You're not forgiven."

190
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,921
This...

191
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,281
Pinched-faced bitch said to me,
"You're not forgiven."

192
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,884
You see, some sheets I'd
washed and hung on the line

193
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,928
had the name of a hotel in them.

194
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,331
They'd been stolen in a robbery,

195
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,529
and they said some porter
at the hotel had been coshed.

196
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,611
And a woman from around here
told the police about the sheets.

197
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,201
Jealous, you see, about the new sheets.

198
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,891
And when the police came,

199
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,567
they found a spirits still.

200
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,482
Making a few drops of gin.

201
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,601
And for that...

202
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,608
(CRYING) They took my children from me.

203
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,562
And they never told me
where they took them.

204
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,043
And they did it 'cause they could,
and 'cause I was weak.

205
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,121
They will never take your
baby away from you.

206
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,881
Do you know why?

207
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,963
'Cause Tommy won't let them.

208
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,841
'Cause Tommy won't let
them walk all over us.

209
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,843
Now, it is Tommy that has brought
strength and power to this family.

210
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,607
'Cause he knows...

211
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,650
You have to be as bad as them
above in order to survive.

212
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,523
I'm telling you this because
I want you to forgive him.

213
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,766
How can I?

214
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,248
When my Freddie's rotting
in jail because of him.

215
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,842
There's something about
today you need to know.

216
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,688
POLICEMAN: All right, Freddie.
Time to go.

217
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,410
I want to get a message to Campbell.

218
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,601
(SIGHS)

219
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,284
I can't let them move me to Brixton.

220
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,607
If l go to Brixton, they'll kill me.

221
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,241
Freddie...

222
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,763
You're not going to get as
far as Brixton prison.

223
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,521
You're free.

224
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,524
CHURCHILL: I told
the Prime Minister personally

225
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,204
that the guns have been retrieved,

226
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,044
and he actually heard me and listened,

227
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,481
and I'm pretty sure he
gave me a half smile.

228
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,928
He never usually smiles unless
a political opponent dies.

229
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,126
(CHUCKLES)

230
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,207
I've plan to put your name
forward in the New Year's Honours List.

231
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,969
- That would be too much, sir.
-Nonsense.

232
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,361
You deserve it.

233
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,165
As I recall, you wrote to me several
times about an undercover operative,

234
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,321
a WOMEN.

235
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,882
Was she involved in the discovery?

236
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,966
Does she deserve some
kind of commendation?

237
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,841
Yes.

238
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,084
She was instrumental.

239
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,961
A truly loyal servant to the Crown.

240
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,482
And that is what the
record should state.

241
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,491
And what of the men who actually
stole the guns? The Peaky...

242
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,207
Blinders, sir.

243
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,925
If we were to make arrests,

244
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,570
the whole thing would end up in
open court, and I know we wish to

245
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,210
keep this matter confidential.

246
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,200
So they' ll go free?

247
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,641
Not quite, sir.

248
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,811
See, I have plans

249
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,920
for the Peaky Blinders.

250
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,127
All right?

251
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,290
(EXCITED CONVERSATION)

252
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,644
POLLY: Leave that, boys,
we'll get back to it later.

253
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,846
TOMMY: Right.

254
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,445
We've brought you all here today

255
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,209
'cause this is the day
we replace Billy Kimber.

256
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,921
This is the day we become respectable.

257
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,164
The day we join the official National
Association of Racecourse Bookmakers.

258
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,086
But, first,

259
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,921
we do the dirty work.

260
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,688
Now, you've all known
this day's been coming,

261
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,285
I just haven't told anyone the date.

262
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,289
We're going to the Worcester races.

263
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,722
Track opens at 1:00,
we get there at 2:00.

264
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,005
Now, Kimber thinks we're going there
to help him fight the Lee brothers.

265
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,929
Thanks to the efforts of our john

266
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,409
and his lovely new wife, Esme,

267
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,687
the Lees are now our kin.

268
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,841
I interrupted those efforts this morning
and, uh,

269
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,766
I can assure you all,
john is making great sacrifices

270
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,970
in the cause of peace.

271
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,087
Yeah, all right.

272
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,967
So it'll be us and the Lees against
Kimber's boys.

273
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,160
We take 'em out and leave the bookies.

274
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,202
I'll expect a swift victory which will
send a signal all the way to London

275
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,525
that we believe in letting legitimate
businesses run peacefully.

276
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,409
JOHN:
And, uh, what about Kimber himself?

277
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,805
I'll deal with Kimber.

278
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,481
Any other questions?

279
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,641
Yes.

280
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,445
Does anyone object if I bring
a newcomer to the meeting?

281
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,321
(WHISPERING) Come on.

282
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,640
I'd like to introduce the newest member
of the Shelby clan.

283
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,369
(APPLAUSE)

284
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,166
Welcome home, Ada.

285
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,967
We named him Karl.

286
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,041
After Karl Marx.

287
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,091
Karl bloody Marx.

288
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,446
Let me get a look at him.

289
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,760
Oh, here we go.

290
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,167
ARTHUR: Hey, look!

291
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,649
He looks just like me, look!

292
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,280
- MAN: Unless his arse looks like you.
-ARTHUR: He's all right.

293
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,081
He's a Shelby.

294
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,881
Well, Ada...

295
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,925
Am I forgiven?

296
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,763
If what Aunt Polly says is true,
you are.

297
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,841
It's true.

299
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,081
Thank you, Tommy.

POLICEMAN:
Someone who wants to keep his eyes.

302
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,365
They came to my house,

303
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,487
told me to volunteer for this.

304
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,807
Who did?

305
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,001
The Peaky Blinders.

THORNE: What the bloody hell is that?

309
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,210
Looks like your friends are here.

310
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,364
Stay down on the ground!
Or the next one's for you.

311

Oh!

312
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,966
POLICEMAN 2: Make it look good.

313
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,448
I am sorry about this, comrade.

314
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,081
Holy shit!

315
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,251
- Danny, you're dead!
-No. I've been living in London.

316
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,446
Same thing.

317

All right, lads, listen up.

319

You have a pint and a chaser,
no more, on the house.

320
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,684
Right. Let's get pouring.

321
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,484
Do you have the enclosure tickets?

322
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,449
And the registered bookkeepers
on the track?

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,281
That could change.

332
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,085
- Tommy...
-We'll talk about it more

333
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,650
when I get back, all right?

334
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,767
When will you be back?

335
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,963
Oh, is this how it's gonna be, eh?

336
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,690
You waiting at home for me,

337
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,531
saying, "What time do you call this?'

338
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,850
The barrel needs changing.

339
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,000
Go on, Tom. Go out the back,
give her a good seeing to before we go.

340
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,407
All right?

341
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,202
Hey, Grace, I was joking.

342
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,131
-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
-MAN: Tommy, we need more mild.

343
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,009
Just help yourselves!

344
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,726
Tommy, the truth is...

345
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,164
When you come back from the races,
I won’t be here.

346
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,081
What are you talking about?

347
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,446
All right, look.

348
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,364
Grace, I know you weren't born
to be with a man like me.

349
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,450
But I'm turning things around.

350
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,647
When I get back here tonight,
I will have

351
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,490
one of the biggest legal race track
syndicates in the country.

352
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,971
I'm gonna close down
some of that other stuff.

353
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,406
Maybe open a club.

354
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,644
Hey, back in London.

355
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,366
And another thing,

356
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,884
you have a contract of employment.

357
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,081
With a real limited company.

358
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,761
You remember?

359
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,970
I remember everything, Tommy.

360
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,970
I'am going to a make a success of this.

361
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,044
I'am going to a make a success of it.

362
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,601
- I am.
-I know.

363
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,366
I know.

364
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,644
I'm not talking about marriage.

365
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,721
I'm so...

366
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,641
We know each other.

367
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,281
We can talk.

368
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,281
We're the same.

369
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,129
Tommy,
I've done something terrible to you.

370
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,521
Right. Tell him what you just told me.

371
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,128
Just heard there's two vans driving up
the Stratford Road.

372
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,687
JEREMIAH: An old corporal of mine said
he recognised some of the men.

373
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,091
He said it's the Kimber boys.

374
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,521
And they're heading this way.

375
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,727
(DOOR SLAMS)

376
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,926
TOMMY: Ada! Wake up!

377
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,890
You and the baby, get into the bullring
where there's lots of people.

378
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,167
- What's going on?
-We've been fucking betrayed.

379
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,886
Someone let slip.
Kimber's men are on their way here.

380
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,601
- Yeah, but you can handle them, Tommy.
-TOMMY: It's just us.

381
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,041
All the Lees are on their way to
Worcester, we're outnumbered.

382
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,641
(SCREAMING) Fuck!

383
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,451
Who else knew today was the day
you were moving on Kimber?

384
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,201
You said you kept it a secret.
Who else did you tell?

385
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,326
There's only one thing can blind
a man as smart as you, Tommy.

386
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,247
Love.

387
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,601
It's that barmaid.

388
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,244
POLLY: I'll deal with Grace.

389
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,651
If you set eyes on her again,
you might kill her.

390
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,046
POLLY: Going for good?

391
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,401
GRACE: I heard there was trouble.

392
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,724
Instinct's a funny thing.

393
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,091
See, normally I can tell about a person,
but with you...

394
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,929
Look, the fighting's about to begin.

395
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,362
- We should get out of here.
-We know who you are.

396
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,086
Tommy knows as well.

397
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,401
Turned out that copper as good as
told him this morning.

398
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,847
But I wanted to hear it
from your own lips.

399
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,449
I'am an agent of the Crown.

400
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,928
I have the power to arrest
and the right to use force.

401
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,044
So please, step out of my way.

402
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,841
Like I say, instinct's a funny thing.
You fell for Tommy for real, didn't you?

403
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,800
This gun is loaded.

404
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,806
I'm not afraid of you.

405
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,040
I feel sorry for you.

406
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,286
Slip of a thing.

407
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,163
Thought you'd come in here and stitch us
all up.

408
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,971
I mean, we've had some copper's narks
in here, but you...

409
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,921
You're the queen of them all.

410
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,001
So who are you?

411
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,525
Rich girl, I'd guess.

412
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,883
Unionist. Ulster Volunteer.

413
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,804
You thought, "Fenians, communists,
low people...

414
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,689
"They're all the same. Scum."

415
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,961
Then you met Tommy.

416
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,284
I'll fight you with my fists
and show you how a rich girl fights.

417
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,890
I'm from a tough family, too.

418
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,486
Nah.

419
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,170
We women have more sense.

420
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,605
Why don't you pour us both a drink?

421
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,161
So am I right?

422
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,645
Did you fall for Tommy?

423
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,641
Yes, I did.

424
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,166
Then I pity you.

425
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,170
You think he'll try to kill me?

426
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,321
That's too soft.

427
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,925
- Soft?
- Soft?

428
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,007
Like you.

429
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,768
You saved his life the night
the coppers came.

430
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,203
That's why we're drinking, not fighting.

431
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,966
We owe you.

432
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,286
What was he like?

433
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,721
Before France?

434
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,046
He laughed. A lot.

435
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,804
He wanted to work with horses.

436
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,441
He won medals?

437
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,601
Threw them in the cut.

438
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,447
Not a single man came back the same.

439
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,770
You know, after all this is over,

440
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,721
he might forgive you.

441
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,681
He might take you in.

442
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,121
Can never tell with men.

443
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,288
They go for whoever their dicks point at
and there's no changing their minds.

444
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,846
But I should tell you something.

445
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,405
I will never forgive you.

446
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,530
Or accept you.

447
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,527
Or take you in.

448
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,091
And it's me who runs the business
of the heart in this family.

449
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,564
And as far as I'm concerned,

450
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,329
you're a snitch from the parish.

451
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,842
And if you're not gone from this city
by tomorrow,

452
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,766
I'll kill you myself.

453
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,041
Now go.

454
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,329
Maybe what really upsets you

455
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,928
is the thought that one day
you might lose him.

456
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,251
Tommy! We've had word
from Nipper at Hay Mills,

457
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,606
and he says
the police are letting them through.

458
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,570
And how come all our police
have disappeared?

459
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,291
'Cause it was the police who told
Kimber about the plan.

460
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,521
And who told the police?

461
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,400
You know what, john?
For all I think I'm the smart one,

462
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,323
I'm guessing it was me.

463
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,281
TOMMY: All right, men.

464
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,688
You were mostly in the war, so you know
that battle plans always change

465
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,922
and get fucked up, well here it is.

466
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,605
Things have changed.

467
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,929
We fight them here. Today. Alone.

468
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,730
Now, they're gonna come for the pub,

469
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,922
they're gonna try
and break us up for good.

470
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,481
And we'll have no help
from 'the law today.

471
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,287
That pub there is called The Garrison!

472
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,965
Well, now it really is one.

473
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,527
And it belongs to us! Right?

474
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,965
ALL: Right!

475
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,121
How many are there?

476
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,288
Jeremiah said two Reilly vans.

477
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,208
So I reckon we're outnumbered
three to one.

478
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,361
ARTHUR: Ah, fuck.

479
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,966
But it's us, boys, it's us!

480
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,122
The Small Heath rifles.

481
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,164
Never lost a fight yet, did we?

482
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,605
- ALL: No!
-All right!

483
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:23,242
Jeremiah, I know you vowed to God
to never pick up a weapon again.

484
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,688
But can you ask him from me
if you can help us today.

485
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,042
God says he done a deal
with Small Heath, sir.

486
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,246
Good man!

487
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,243
Arthur, Scudboat, you take the flanks.

488
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,606
- Just like at St Marie.
-Sure.

489
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,727
Curly.

490
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,928
If any Shelby man dies here today,

of a large group of men

495

in vehicles heading towards the city.

496
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,484
Most of them are
known to the police, sir.

about to break out.

502

-and Hay Mills.
-Stood down, sir?

503
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,368
Immediately.
And the vehicles approaching the city

504
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,125
-should not be impeded.
-What the hell is going on?

505
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,325
Let dog eat dog.

506

You're not accustomed to not getting
what you want, are you, Tommy?

You wanted my pub, and you took it.

511
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,449
You got a fair price.

512
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,087

they want you to win this battle.

nothing.

over there?

just give the order.

Lane, they're armed with rifles.

are not my concern.

Well, we've outside reports of
machine gun fire in Saltley.

It's the ravings of an old soldier
with shell shock.

and I was sick of all the corruption.

about cleaning this place up,
