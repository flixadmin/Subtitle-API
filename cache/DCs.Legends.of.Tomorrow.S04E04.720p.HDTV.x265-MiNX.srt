1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,562
Previously on "Legend's of Tomorrow"...

2
00:00:01,565 --> 00:00:03,897
Mallus wasn't the only
prisoner to escape.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,679
Now there's magic.

4
00:00:06,682 --> 00:00:09,120
An unknown number of other
dangerous magical beings

5
00:00:09,122 --> 00:00:10,622
got spat out across the timeline

6
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,546
and now must be sent to hell.

7
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:13,658
She's a shapeshifter.

8
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:18,230
- What did you do to me?
- Lobotomy of sorts.

9
00:00:18,232 --> 00:00:20,899
Your shapeshifting days
are over, sweetheart.

10
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:22,033
No!

11
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:24,500
She definitely isn't Amaya.

12
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:40,252
Did you just hear that?

13
00:00:40,254 --> 00:00:42,287
Judy, relax.

14
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:44,623
There's nothing out here.

15
00:00:44,626 --> 00:00:47,392
Tonight it's just you and me, okay?

16
00:00:57,871 --> 00:00:59,704
Wait a second.

17
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:01,406
Don't tell me that
the fearless Ms. Lance

18
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:03,174
is scared of a little horror film.

19
00:01:03,176 --> 00:01:04,609
No, I love horror movies,

20
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:06,611
and I watched them obsessively as a kid,

21
00:01:06,613 --> 00:01:09,047
so how could I have missed this gem?

22
00:01:11,812 --> 00:01:14,419
"Swamp Thaaaang."

23
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:17,222
Never heard of it. And
what's with all the As?

24
00:01:17,224 --> 00:01:20,325
Okay, let me look.

25
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:21,960
Okay, "Swamp Thaaaang."

26
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:24,229
Apparently there are four As in the name

27
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:26,197
because it's the fourth
film in the franchise.

28
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:27,866
The A.V. Club gave it a D-plus, saying,

29
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:30,735
"The production design is as
lazy as the action staging."

30
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:32,437
- Harsh.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:34,472
"Based on real-life
tragic events that occurred

32
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:37,876
at Camp Ogawa, Maine,
in the summer of 1995"?

33
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:39,878
Gideon.

34
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,380
- We're in my room, babe.
- Right.

35
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:46,584
Speak of the devil.

36
00:01:46,586 --> 00:01:48,820
Sorry to interrupt,
Captain, but I've detected

37
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:50,555
new magical events in the timeline.

38
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:52,023
It seems that a number of children

39
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:53,558
went missing from a summer camp...

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,676
Let me guess. Camp Ogawa, Maine.

41
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:56,828
Precisely.

42
00:01:56,831 --> 00:01:58,825
Looks like the handiwork
of one of our fugitives.

43
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:00,936
Shall I plot a course to 1995, then?

44
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:03,223
And while you're at it,
fabricate a mess of bug spray.

45
00:02:03,226 --> 00:02:04,669
I'm on my way.

46
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:05,904
Well, how about that?

47
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:07,218
We almost got to spend

48
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:09,207
two whole uninterrupted hours together.

49
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:11,042
How about...

50
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:12,844
you come with me?

51
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:14,446
Summer camp?

52
00:02:14,448 --> 00:02:16,614
As in bug bites, bunk
beds, and mean girls?

53
00:02:16,616 --> 00:02:19,050
No, summer camp, as in camp fires,

54
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:21,686
sing-alongs, and friendship bracelets.

55
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:23,621
Camp's the best. You'll love it.

56
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:24,656
Pinkie swear.

57
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:26,140
What are you doing?

58
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:28,075
It's something you do when you're a kid.

59
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:29,247
It's like a promise.

60
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,029
What?

61
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:34,299
Come on. No, pinkie.

62
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:35,812
- Yes!
- Weird.

63
00:02:35,815 --> 00:02:37,148
This will be a great way

64
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:38,784
for us to spend some more time together,

65
00:02:38,787 --> 00:02:40,421
and, plus, we get to make sure

66
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:42,473
that doesn't happen in real life.

67

68
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:53,256
I talked to Nate,

69
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:54,760
and he's got things
covered at the Bureau.

70
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:56,010
He and Gary have their hands full

71
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:57,387
with all the magical
creatures popping up.

72
00:02:57,389 --> 00:02:59,945
Nate and Gary are in charge.

73
00:02:59,948 --> 00:03:02,426
Well, anyways, I'm glad that he's there

74
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:06,631
because we've got something I
really don't want him to see.

75
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,106
What's that?

76
00:03:11,338 --> 00:03:12,871
Amaya.

77
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:17,308
It just looks like her.

78
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,545
- Did you say "it"?
- She's a shapeshifter.

79
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:22,547
We found her in London, 1977.

80
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,082
Hmm. Hello.

81
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:29,853
- Not much of a talker, I see.
- Oh, she talks.

82
00:03:29,856 --> 00:03:31,189
Go to hell!

83
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:32,843
Just her way of saying "hello."

84
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:35,406
Oh, let me out of here, you bastards!

85
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:37,943
She's still adjusting to her new home.

86
00:03:37,946 --> 00:03:42,131
Maybe it's the food.

87
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:43,767
But Constantine sent the other fugitives

88
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,403
you encountered to hell, so...

89
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:47,939
Well, she's not exactly
a bloodthirsty unicorn.

90
00:03:47,941 --> 00:03:49,874
Or an evil fairy godmother.

91
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:52,343
But you decided to keep
the shapeshifter because...?

92
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:58,043
Oh. To exploit her for information

93
00:03:58,046 --> 00:03:59,417
about the inter-dimensional prison

94
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:00,601
that she's been trapped in

95
00:04:00,604 --> 00:04:02,352
to help us track down other fugitives.

96
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:03,588
That is...

97
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,623
exactly what we are doing.

98
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,358
100%.

99
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,693
Isn't that right, Zari?

100
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:09,906
Yeah, yeah.

101
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:13,364
Um, I'm... I'm gathering
that intel as we speak.

102
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:15,266
Hm. I love the initiative, team.

103
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:16,701
Yeah.

104
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:18,269
Gentlemen.

105
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:21,606
Ooh, Director Sharpe.
Joining us, are we?

106
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:24,275
- Is that a problem?
- Not for me, love.

107
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:27,137
Good, because we are
headed back to the '90s

108
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,328
to infiltrate a place called Camp Ogawa.

109
00:04:29,331 --> 00:04:31,716
Oh, sneaking into a
military facility, are we?

110
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:33,536
Actually, it's a summer camp for kids.

111
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,023
Oh, I loved summer camp.

112
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:36,707
Everyone used to call me, Kid Counselor.

113
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,899
Bet you took that as a
compliment, too, didn't you, mate?

114
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:41,201
Well, because of my
leadership skills, obviously.

115
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,195
Right? That's why.

116
00:04:44,197 --> 00:04:45,997
Mm-hmm, yeah.

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,528
So, uh, any idea of
what kind of foul beast

118
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:49,774
we're up against, then?

119
00:04:49,777 --> 00:04:52,970
Well, based on... research
Sarah and I have been doing,

120
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:56,307
we could be looking for
a swampy monster thing.

121
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:58,843
According to the timeline,
before the end of summer,

122
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:01,813
several kids went missing,
never to be seen again.

123
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:04,015
Well, I happen to know a Swamp Thing.

124
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:06,618
But then again, Maine is way
too far North for that muppet.

125
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,180
Well, we used to use the buddy system

126
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,121
to make sure everyone was safe.

127
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:13,157
And this is where Nate
would say, "I'm your buddy,"

128
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:16,160
and we'd do a fist bump
or a silly jig or...

129
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:17,774
Well, we are shorthanded,

130
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:20,898
so I need you to partner up with John.

131
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:22,300
Oh, don't worry, dreamboat.

132
00:05:22,302 --> 00:05:24,435
I've had stranger bedfellows than you.

133
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:26,204
But just so you know,
I'm not one to get all

134
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:28,239
gussied up for a gig, all right?

135
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:36,914
Oh, they may take my coat,
but you will never take my...

136
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:38,349
Nope. And lose the tie.

137
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:40,969
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

138
00:05:40,972 --> 00:05:42,505
Fine.

139
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,889
One time, but it's only for the kids.

140
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:48,555
Yeah, that's the camp spirit.

141
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:50,894
Are these outfits really necessary?

142
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:53,264
- Girl...
- Come on. Gideon made us

143
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:55,500
official Camp Ogawa counselor uniforms

144
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:57,869
using archival photos
so that we could fit in.

145
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:00,039
What are you guys doing
just standing around?

146
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:03,176
Hi, we are the new camp counselors.

147
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:04,797
Sorry to show up unannounced.

148
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,601
Well, Freckles, the name's Paula Cooper.

149
00:06:07,604 --> 00:06:09,380
I'm the director here.

150
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:10,949
Welcome to Camp Ogawa.

151
00:06:10,951 --> 00:06:12,623
My right-hand man, Chad Stephens,

152
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:13,826
will show you around.

153
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:15,053
Chad!

154
00:06:15,055 --> 00:06:17,355
Get over here.

155
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:18,586
What's up?

156
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:21,092
Chad, you marble cut of prime beef,

157
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:23,294
give these new counselors the tour.

158
00:06:23,297 --> 00:06:25,897
Cool. All right, hey,
let's bounce over this way.

159
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:28,166
I'll give you the 411
on this place, huh?

160
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:30,234
Yeah.

161
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:31,970
What we need are snipers
on that ridgeline,

162
00:06:31,972 --> 00:06:33,938
spotters on the ground,
and an exfil site

163
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,206
for when we bag the creature.

164
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,975
Not a bad plan, Sharpie.

165
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:38,943
I'll put a protection
spell around my perimeter

166
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:40,578
to keep out the nasties.

167
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,747
Best offense is a strong defense.

168
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:44,082
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

169
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:45,727
So, as you can see,

170
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,619
Camp Ogawa is a miserable place,

171
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:50,722
and Paula runs it like a POW camp.

172
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:53,579
Not!

173
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:56,527
Oh, God, not a '90s "not" joke.

174
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:58,963
It's like comic comfort food.

175
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:01,332
I'm sorry, I couldn't help
but admire your lanyard.

176
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:02,600
Did you make that yourself?

177
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:04,232
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

178
00:07:04,235 --> 00:07:06,403
Yeah, along with 21
required merit badges,

179
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:08,443
I also went on to get certification

180
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:10,241
in nuclear science and dentistry.

181
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:12,466
Oh, snap. I've got
some serious competition

182
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:14,411
for coolest counselor this summer, huh?

183
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:16,214
Ah...

184
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:19,150
What about you? You
got any special skills?

185
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:20,661
Martial arts.

186
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:23,087
Ah. Hwah!

187
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:24,361
Sorry, it's just so fresh.

188
00:07:24,364 --> 00:07:26,989
It's like, Jackie Chan, you know?

189
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:30,662
I prefer knives and swords.

190
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:33,031
Right, yeah. Point taken.

191
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:35,099
- "Point taken."
- Ha ha! Good one, bro.

192
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:36,776
Anyway, let's head over here, all right?

193
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:38,436
I'm gonna assign you your cabins.

194
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:40,338
It's gonna be a heck of a summer.

195
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,607
Okay. He'll grow on you.

196
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:46,244
Greetings, members of Newton Cabin

197
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:48,112
I am Counselor Ray,

198
00:07:48,115 --> 00:07:51,216
and the mysterious gentleman
behind you is Counselor John.

199
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:54,118
Cheers, lads.

200
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,188
Well, today's subject
is wilderness survival,

201
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,458
which includes tracking
and orienteering.

202
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,626
Who's excited?

203
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:06,397
Well, you will be, okay?

204
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,497
Two words to remember when tracking...

205
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,501
"displacement" and "direction."

206
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:12,242
Now, Counselor John will demonstrate

207
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:14,526
the kind of inadvertent
markers people leave behind

208
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:17,008
while walking in the woods.

209
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,543
And...

210
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:21,052
Counselor John is missing already.

211
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:23,489
See how easy it is to get
lost in the woods, gentlemen?

212
00:08:23,492 --> 00:08:26,416
- What's up, Franklin Cabin?
- Whoo!

213
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:27,810
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

214
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:31,989
We are in the house. I
am Sara, and this is Ava.

215
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:34,192
We are your camp counselors.

216
00:08:34,194 --> 00:08:38,408
Now, I was thinking, we
need a secret handshake.

217
00:08:38,411 --> 00:08:39,897
Yeah.

218
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,834
Something really cool that only we know.

219
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:44,502
- Yeah.
- So cool.

220
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:46,671
- What are you doing?
- Bonding.

221
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:48,272
How is that supposed to keep them safe

222
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:49,630
from what's in the woods?

223
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:52,209
It allows us to form
a meaningful connection

224
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:54,126
and them to feel like
they're part of a team.

225
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:56,097
They aren't gonna be a part
of anything if they're dead.

226
00:08:56,099 --> 00:08:57,162
- Ava.
- We can go back

227
00:08:57,165 --> 00:08:59,850
to the fun and games once
we catch the creature, yes?

228
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:01,686
All right, ladies...

229
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:02,997
change in plan.

230
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,068
Today we're going to celebrate
your first day of camp

231
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,911
by using safety and discipline, got it?

232
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:12,162
Now, when I blow this whistle,
you are to run... not walk...

233
00:09:12,165 --> 00:09:13,513
To your respective beds.

234
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:17,958
But it's still daytime.

235
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:19,904
It will feel like nighttime
when your eyes are closed.

236
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:21,773
Now move!

237
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,376
Very nice.

238
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:38,556
What are you doing?

239
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:41,225
Oh, I'm creating a protective
barrier to catch monsters.

240
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:43,333
- "Monsters"?
- Yeah.

241
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:45,963
You know, the kind that
slice your stomach open

242
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:48,266
and eat your intestines for supper.

243
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:58,576
Getting those kids to bed was
a lot easier than I expected.

244
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:01,646
You know, I'm really glad I came.

245
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:04,248
I just feel bad... we're
ruining camp for these kids.

246
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,917
It's such an important time.

247
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,652
Well, I didn't realize
you were so gung-ho

248
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:09,120
about this whole camp thing.

249
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:11,956
I was even Color Captain one year.

250
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,791
Hmm?

251
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:16,294
Summer after eighth grade.

252
00:10:16,296 --> 00:10:18,396
I really stuck it to Suzy Smith

253
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:20,298
and the Green Team that year.

254
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,767
- Sounds magical.
- It was.

255
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:28,406
Unfortunately, we're here
to stop magic, my love.

256
00:10:28,408 --> 00:10:30,675
Well, with us guarding their cabin

257
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:34,545
and Constantine's perimeter,
at least no Swampy Monster

258
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:36,981
is getting into this camp tonight.

259
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:01,572
Who's there?

260
00:11:08,615 --> 00:11:12,116
Relax, Lenise. It's just me.

261
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:13,551
Zack.

262
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:15,720
So what do you want to do?

263
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:17,788
Have you ever kissed anyone before?

264
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:27,365
Zack?

265
00:11:38,185 --> 00:11:40,052
Beautiful morning.

266
00:11:40,054 --> 00:11:43,422
Yeah, sorry to burst your
summer-loving bubble, mate,

267
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:45,190
but we're missing one
of our young charges.

268
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:47,079
His name is Zack or something.

269
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,816
Well, are you sure you counted right?

270
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:50,351
Because based on your whiskey cologne,

271
00:11:50,354 --> 00:11:52,531
- I think you're still drunk.
- No, he's right.

272
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:54,400
Yeah, a girl is missing
from our cabin, too,

273
00:11:54,402 --> 00:11:56,535
even after I put the
fear of God in them.

274
00:11:56,537 --> 00:11:58,929
Obviously, there's something wrong

275
00:11:58,932 --> 00:12:00,437
with Constantine's booby trap.

276
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,241
Are you off your trolley, mate?

277
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,742
My spell was designed to keep
the monsters from getting in,

278
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:06,612
not children getting out.

279
00:12:06,614 --> 00:12:08,711
They must have snuck out
in the middle of the night.

280
00:12:08,714 --> 00:12:10,398
Snuck out? Why would they sneak out?

281
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:12,062
To make out, duh.

282
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,753
Well, I suppose we should
notify the camp director.

283
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:16,021
Okay, guys, so...

284
00:12:16,023 --> 00:12:17,923
Oh, don't worry about those kids.

285
00:12:17,925 --> 00:12:19,425
They're gonna be just fine.

286
00:12:19,427 --> 00:12:21,779
Uh, shouldn't we mount
a search party or...

287
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,148
They couldn't have gotten too far.

288
00:12:23,151 --> 00:12:26,230
Look, Freckles, this happens every year.

289
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:28,534
Kids under the influence
of their hormones

290
00:12:28,536 --> 00:12:30,492
go off into the woods at night.

291
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:34,086
Just watch. They'll eventually
get hungry and tired,

292
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:35,440
and they'll come back.

293
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:38,043
Now go out there and do some counseling.

294
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:40,258
Well, someone gives precisely zero craps

295
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:42,648
about the safety of our campers.

296
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,967
I guarantee you one of these kids

297
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,470
knows where the other two went.

298
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:47,672
How can you be so sure?

299
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:49,121
Because when I was in camp,

300
00:12:49,123 --> 00:12:51,423
we used to hide stuff from
the counselors all the time.

301
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:55,394
We just need to figure out
how to get them to talk.

302
00:12:57,765 --> 00:13:00,566
Circle of trust creates a safe space

303
00:13:00,568 --> 00:13:03,435
for us to share our
secrets without judgment.

304
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:06,405
Now, take each other's hands.

305
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:10,909
- Now I want you...
- Yeah, sorry to butt in, lads.

306
00:13:10,911 --> 00:13:13,912
But, uh, can I have a
word with you for a second?

307
00:13:18,218 --> 00:13:20,118
I want you to meditate
on the word "openness,"

308
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,087
and I'll be right back.

309
00:13:23,357 --> 00:13:24,790
You're interrup...

310
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:26,592
You're interrupting the flow.

311
00:13:26,594 --> 00:13:29,394
Yeah, well, apologies
to you and your flow,

312
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:30,963
but all of your psychobabble...

313
00:13:30,965 --> 00:13:32,164
That ain't gonna cut the mustard

314
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,298
with the young ones, mate.

315
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,628
Let me show you how it's done.

316
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:37,368
Right, then, which one
of you whippersnappers

317
00:13:37,371 --> 00:13:40,238
wants to be hypnotized?

318
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,174
Me, me, me, me!

319
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:46,173
Alexis, you and Lenise
are besties, right?

320
00:13:46,176 --> 00:13:48,476
We were partners in
last year's talent show.

321
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:50,415
She didn't show up at
roll call this morning.

322
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:53,751
I'm worried. Do you know
where she might have gone?

323
00:13:53,754 --> 00:13:55,495
All right, ladies, on your feet.

324
00:13:55,498 --> 00:13:58,832
Report to the front of your
bed, arms by your sides, now.

325
00:13:58,835 --> 00:14:00,448
What is with the police lineup?

326
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:02,485
This is summer camp,
not boot camp, remember?

327
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:03,829
You are too soft on these kids.

328
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:05,130
Children crave authority.

329
00:14:05,132 --> 00:14:07,299
Besides, my way will be quicker.

330
00:14:10,638 --> 00:14:13,839
That's it. Look at my watch.

331
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:17,342
Now, where did your mate
Zack run off to last night?

332
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:19,077
He didn't say.

333
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,980
But I hope he didn't go
near the outdoor showers.

334
00:14:21,982 --> 00:14:23,548
Why?

335
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,884
What's by the outdoor showers?

336
00:14:25,886 --> 00:14:28,420
That's where I hid my
Victoria's Secret catalog.

337
00:14:28,422 --> 00:14:30,042
Ah.

338
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:33,324
Your friend Lenise snuck
out of the cabin last night.

339
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:35,023
And no one's going anywhere

340
00:14:35,026 --> 00:14:37,265
until I find out where she went.

341
00:14:37,268 --> 00:14:41,667
But the ice cream social
is in, like, five minutes.

342
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:43,869
Well, then you better,
like, start talking, Kiana,

343
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:45,871
or you're gonna have to
scrape the bottom of the carton

344
00:14:45,873 --> 00:14:47,472
for what's left.

345
00:14:49,543 --> 00:14:52,164
Last night Zack said something

346
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:54,645
about meeting someone in the woods.

347
00:14:54,648 --> 00:14:56,648
Where in the woods exactly?

348
00:14:56,651 --> 00:14:58,116
A baseball field.

349
00:14:58,118 --> 00:15:00,951
Only, there's no
baseball field out there.

350
00:15:00,954 --> 00:15:04,422
Well, that's all right. Keep digging.

351
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:07,759
He kept talking about making
it to first base with a girl.

352
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:10,362
But who plays baseball in the dark?

353
00:15:14,865 --> 00:15:17,602
She probably went to the
same place your style went.

354
00:15:17,604 --> 00:15:20,572
You could use a makeover,
like, head to toe.

355
00:15:27,396 --> 00:15:30,557
Ms. Tomaz, the prisoner
is growing quite unruly.

356
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,793
Tell her to knock herself out.

357
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,825
Aw. I take that back.

358
00:15:43,397 --> 00:15:45,630
Damn it, not on my watch.

359
00:15:56,643 --> 00:15:59,311
Whoo! Ha ha!

360
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:06,218
Okay, I feel like we got
off on the wrong foot.

361
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,320
It's just that you're
wearing my friend's face,

362
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:11,056
and it's a little
unsettling, given your...

363
00:16:11,058 --> 00:16:12,991
general demeanor.

364
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:14,659
Look...

365
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:16,828
I didn't love it at
first when I got here,

366
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,530
but I found my place.

367
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:19,831
You can too.

368
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:21,732
Take a look in the mirror, sweetheart.

369
00:16:21,735 --> 00:16:24,362
It's not my face that
should be unsettling.

370
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:26,565
You're the one putting things in cages.

371
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:33,026
So how many girls

372
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:35,870
has the missus made cry so
far, or have you lost count?

373
00:16:35,873 --> 00:16:37,314
Ava's interrogation techniques

374
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:38,940
aren't going to work on them.

375
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:40,509
They'd rather take their secrets

376
00:16:40,512 --> 00:16:42,086
to the grave than squeal.

377
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:43,339
Anything with the boys?

378
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:45,273
Oh, those boys aren't hiding a thing.

379
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:46,391
They're open books,

380
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:49,694
if those books were written
by hapless fools, that is.

381
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:52,570
If I could just become one of them,

382
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:53,932
another 12-year-old camper,

383
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:57,135
I could get these
girls to talk like that.

384
00:16:57,137 --> 00:16:59,604
I do believe that you've just sparked

385
00:16:59,606 --> 00:17:03,275
an idea there, Ms. Lance.

386
00:17:14,021 --> 00:17:15,921
End of the road, kid.

387
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,130
In your cage.

388
00:17:31,138 --> 00:17:34,940
Bloke like you doesn't
strike me as a jailer.

389
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:36,975
I believe we're more
alike than you think.

390
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:39,311
You look like you've been on the inside.

391
00:17:39,313 --> 00:17:41,179
That's right.

392
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:42,948
And how do you sleep at night...

393
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,117
hanging out with these
jailer mates of yours?

394
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:48,086
Alcohol.

395
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:51,633
Oh, hey. I made an
additional list of suspects

396
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:53,425
- I want to question.
- Ava...

397
00:17:53,427 --> 00:17:54,949
Look, I know that you just want them

398
00:17:54,952 --> 00:17:55,979
to have fun, all right?

399
00:17:55,982 --> 00:17:56,910
But the fact of the matter is,

400
00:17:56,912 --> 00:17:59,143
there is a monster out there
hunting down these kids,

401
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:01,780
and these girls are
stonewalling us, okay?

402
00:18:02,803 --> 00:18:04,836
Counselor Ava?

403
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:06,504
Yes?

404
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:09,307
I'm ready to tell you
what's really going on.

405
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,210
Go on, honey. Spill the beans.

406
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:15,180
It won't stop unless you do something.

407
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:16,362
What won't stop?

408
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:19,667
The monster that lives under
the dock... the lake beast.

409
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,870
Who's the lake beast?

410
00:18:20,873 --> 00:18:23,287
Years ago, at this very camp,

411
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,123
some mean kids played a prank on a boy,

412
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,858
and he drowned in the lake.

413
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,962
And now every year he
returns to get his revenge.

414
00:18:30,964 --> 00:18:33,798
And so you think the lake
beast took your friends?

415
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:37,902
They say the only way to make him appear

416
00:18:37,904 --> 00:18:42,240
is to go to the dock alone
and call his name three times.

417
00:18:43,477 --> 00:18:45,477
Sweetie, you are so
brave, and I promise you,

418
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:47,912
the lake beast won't be
getting anyone tonight, okay?

419
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,596
Guys.

420
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:06,731
Guys, I think I see a
Northern Saw-whet Owl.

421
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:08,307
Ray, focus.

422
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:13,147
Fine. I'll save it for
my bird-watching journal.

423
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,011
Okay, you're in the clear, Ava.

424
00:19:20,147 --> 00:19:21,813
Stupid bird.

425
00:19:33,393 --> 00:19:35,393
Okay, let's get this over with.

426
00:19:38,265 --> 00:19:41,066
Lake Beast, Lake Beast, Lake Beast.

427
00:19:50,577 --> 00:19:51,609
Hmm.

428
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,880
Guys, this feels like a bust to me.

429
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:16,201
Ah, it was just a bloody prank.

430
00:20:16,203 --> 00:20:18,036
- Oh!
- Go, go, go.

431
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:20,800
You okay?

432
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:24,339
Nice night for a swim,
though, eh, Sharpie?

433
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:27,577
Those girls are...

434
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,313
monsters!

435
00:20:34,445 --> 00:20:35,978
After we left the lake last night,

436
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,646
another one of our campers went missing.

437
00:20:37,648 --> 00:20:39,248
Another one of ours is missing, too.

438
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,761
That makes four in total.

439
00:20:40,764 --> 00:20:42,984
They must have snuck out
to meet up with each other

440
00:20:42,987 --> 00:20:44,136
and never made it back.

441
00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:45,620
Yeah, well, I don't know about you lot,

442
00:20:45,622 --> 00:20:47,456
but I'm not just sitting around here

443
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:49,891
waiting for the monster
to go and get another kid.

444
00:20:49,894 --> 00:20:50,833
We better split up.

445
00:20:50,836 --> 00:20:53,081
All right, you two check the
woods for the missing kids.

446
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:55,630
Ava and I... We'll stay watch here.

447
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:57,867
Hey, wait, buddy system!

448
00:20:59,303 --> 00:21:02,773
I heard about last night.
It's majorly uncool.

449
00:21:02,776 --> 00:21:04,240
Who knew kids could be so mean?

450
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:05,419
They've been calling me Lake Beast

451
00:21:05,421 --> 00:21:06,667
behind my back all day.

452
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:10,145
- Excuse me, Lake Beast.
- And to my face.

453
00:21:10,148 --> 00:21:12,961
Okay. Hey, that is enough, ladies.

454
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:14,350
The joke is over.

455
00:21:14,352 --> 00:21:16,585
It's time for you to behave, or
else your cabin will be banned

456
00:21:16,587 --> 00:21:19,021
from the July Jamboree.

457
00:21:20,725 --> 00:21:23,058
The only way we are going
to get any information

458
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,953
from these girls is to
infiltrate their clique.

459
00:21:24,956 --> 00:21:27,196
How are we supposed to
do that? We're not kids.

460
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:28,862
Funny you should say that.

461
00:21:28,865 --> 00:21:32,000
Constantine gave me a potion
that would turn us into kids

462
00:21:32,003 --> 00:21:33,969
only temporarily.

463
00:21:33,971 --> 00:21:35,806
You're kidding, right?

464
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:37,575
Wha... Even if it works, Sara,

465
00:21:37,578 --> 00:21:39,212
I wouldn't have any idea
how to act like a kid

466
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,609
because I've never been one.

467
00:21:40,611 --> 00:21:43,045
All my childhood memories
are fake, remember?

468
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:47,716
How are we going to find the
kids with that dangly thing?

469
00:21:47,718 --> 00:21:49,818
You know, this ritual usually works best

470
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,288
when someone isn't
yammering in my ear hole.

471
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,722
Well, you want to find the kids,

472
00:21:53,724 --> 00:21:55,357
we got to do it the old-fashioned way.

473
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,835
Study their tracks.

474
00:21:56,838 --> 00:21:58,068
It's a good thing I came prepared,

475
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,107
because one step in the
wrong direction here,

476
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,844
and you'll be traveling
for miles in the wrong...

477
00:22:01,846 --> 00:22:06,035
Damn it, you Nandy Pandy,
I said I need silence.

478
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:07,518
Oh, you meant right now.

479
00:22:07,521 --> 00:22:09,554
I'm sorry, I thought you meant...

480
00:22:12,443 --> 00:22:14,410
Why are you being such a jerk?

481
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:16,078
Because you shouldn't even be out here

482
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,447
chasing a magical creature, all right?

483
00:22:18,449 --> 00:22:19,995
It's too dangerous.

484
00:22:19,998 --> 00:22:21,331
Too dangerous?

485
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:23,134
You're lucky you're out here with me,

486
00:22:23,137 --> 00:22:25,553
because I can keep us alive
on bugs and berries alone.

487
00:22:25,556 --> 00:22:28,550
You know, this has nothing to
do with survival in the wild

488
00:22:28,553 --> 00:22:30,739
and everything to do with
surviving magical creatures

489
00:22:30,742 --> 00:22:32,894
and those who dabble in the dark arts.

490
00:22:32,897 --> 00:22:35,094
I'll have you know, I am no
stranger to the world of magic.

491
00:22:35,096 --> 00:22:36,323
Yeah.

492
00:22:36,326 --> 00:22:38,734
Oh, don't think I haven't
heard how Nora Darhk had you

493
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:41,437
eating out of the palm
of her wicked little hand.

494
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:43,273
Oh, I bet she didn't even have to ask

495
00:22:43,276 --> 00:22:45,140
for the time stone, did she?

496
00:22:45,142 --> 00:22:49,495
No, you just gave it away
like biscuits at tea time.

497
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:52,081
Nora and I have a mutual
respect for each other.

498
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:54,383
It's not like I was
tripping over myself...

499
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,687
What is that?

500
00:23:02,727 --> 00:23:05,561
No doubt left behind
by the magical beast.

501
00:23:05,563 --> 00:23:08,097
Who sheds its skin
after it eats the kids?

502
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:10,833
What are we looking for?
Some sort of snake monster?

503
00:23:10,835 --> 00:23:13,346
The answer is in this book.

504
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:16,037
Is that a magical Audubon guide?

505
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,973
Neat-o.

506
00:23:17,975 --> 00:23:19,742
Mmm.

507
00:23:19,744 --> 00:23:21,910
It's good. What is it?

508
00:23:21,912 --> 00:23:25,814
Hooch. I spent a little
time in a Siberian gulag.

509
00:23:25,816 --> 00:23:28,317
Got a taste for it.

510
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:31,487
Where I was it felt like 500 years.

511
00:23:31,489 --> 00:23:33,188
Time worked differently in that realm.

512
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,953
Oh, I've been in a lot of
cages, but not a magical one.

513
00:23:36,956 --> 00:23:38,221
What was it like?

514
00:23:38,224 --> 00:23:40,728
The inside of my cage
was a constant battle

515
00:23:40,731 --> 00:23:43,399
between creatures from
your worst nightmare.

516
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:46,669
I, uh, got to know some of
them better than I wanted to.

517
00:23:46,671 --> 00:23:48,871
It was a dismal and a dark dimension,

518
00:23:48,873 --> 00:23:51,106
like nothing here on Earth.

519
00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:53,331
And I'll be damned if
I'm ever going back.

520
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:56,978
Well, cheers to that.

521
00:24:01,318 --> 00:24:03,451
Friendship bracelet?

522
00:24:03,454 --> 00:24:05,987
No, it's an "I'm sorry" bracelet.

523
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,120
I shouldn't have run off like that.

524
00:24:08,123 --> 00:24:09,890
It's just that you know I'm not normal,

525
00:24:09,893 --> 00:24:11,692
and I think you hit
a nerve or something.

526
00:24:11,695 --> 00:24:13,662
No, I'm sorry.

527
00:24:13,665 --> 00:24:15,376
I never even thought about the fact

528
00:24:15,379 --> 00:24:16,845
that you'd never been a kid.

529
00:24:16,848 --> 00:24:19,582
- Yeah.
- But this is really good.

530
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:22,057
Ugh. I confiscated it from Alexis.

531
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,893
See, I'm weird. I...

532
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:26,523
Do you know that those two
actors who are my parents...

533
00:24:26,526 --> 00:24:28,759
I keep a picture of them
on my desk in my office

534
00:24:28,762 --> 00:24:30,912
just so I can try to
feel a little bit normal.

535
00:24:30,915 --> 00:24:32,715
Yeah, that is anything but normal.

536
00:24:32,717 --> 00:24:33,948
Yeah.

537
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:36,150
Guys. I think we've ID'd our monster.

538
00:24:36,153 --> 00:24:38,020
Constantine and I found a skin suit

539
00:24:38,022 --> 00:24:40,356
shed by something called a shtriga.

540
00:24:40,358 --> 00:24:42,224
- Come again?
- A shtriga.

541
00:24:42,226 --> 00:24:43,401
It's a vampiric witch.

542
00:24:43,404 --> 00:24:45,127
It feeds off the life force of children.

543
00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:47,463
Bloody brilliant setting
up shop at summer camp.

544
00:24:47,465 --> 00:24:49,231
Ah, there's some good news, sort of.

545
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:51,667
Uh, it says here the shtriga
feeds slowly off its prey

546
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:54,336
draining its life energy
over a course of days,

547
00:24:54,338 --> 00:24:56,667
which means the missing
kids could still be alive.

548
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,557
Then it's on you guys to find them.

549
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,726
All right.

550
00:25:01,045 --> 00:25:03,229
Okay, and it's on us
to protect these girls.

551
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,898
Now, I know you think I'm crazy,

552
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:06,768
but what if the best way to protect them

553
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:10,051
is by becoming one of them
and lure the creature out?

554
00:25:10,054 --> 00:25:12,089
We'll be the bait.

555
00:25:12,092 --> 00:25:14,389
What if Constantine's
potion doesn't work on me?

556
00:25:14,392 --> 00:25:16,425
There's only one way to find out.

557
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:19,089
And if it does, I'll be with
you every step of the way.

558
00:25:19,092 --> 00:25:21,659
Show you the ropes.
Teach you how to be a kid.

559
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:24,299
Pinkie swear?

560
00:25:25,835 --> 00:25:27,869
Pinkie swear.

561
00:25:29,974 --> 00:25:32,508
All right, lights out, everyone!

562
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,967
Hey, that means you, too, Hopper Cabin.

563
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,970
Don't make me come in there.

564
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:45,779
- Do you feel anything yet?
- Mm...

565
00:25:45,782 --> 00:25:47,582
No.

566
00:25:47,585 --> 00:25:49,251
Maybe it doesn't work.

567
00:25:52,663 --> 00:25:56,098
The pretty lights tell me otherwise.

568
00:26:00,237 --> 00:26:02,671
Hey, what are you two doing in here?

569
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:09,511
Oh, snap.

570
00:26:10,388 --> 00:26:12,656
Where did you guys come
from out of the blue?

571
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,224
Got kicked out of Clark Cabin

572
00:26:14,226 --> 00:26:17,628
for putting a frog under
Christi Donovan's pillow.

573
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,930
You should have heard her scream.

574
00:26:19,932 --> 00:26:21,465
Cool.

575
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:23,634
And you?

576
00:26:23,636 --> 00:26:24,872
I was kicked out

577
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,786
'cause I was caught
reading after lights out.

578
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:28,638
Reading? Lame.

579
00:26:28,641 --> 00:26:31,074
Uh, her counselors only
thought she was reading,

580
00:26:31,076 --> 00:26:33,963
but really she was writing
a letter to her boyfriend.

581
00:26:33,966 --> 00:26:36,213
He lives in France.

582
00:26:36,215 --> 00:26:37,915
This year's counselors are the worst.

583
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:39,750
Especially Lake Beast.

584
00:26:39,752 --> 00:26:42,686
Yeah, I heard she smells bad.

585
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:44,822
Hey...

586
00:26:44,824 --> 00:26:47,357
Um, yeah, I heard she
looked really funny

587
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:49,739
when she fell into the water.

588
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:51,929
But you're lucky she
didn't catch pneumonia.

589
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:53,964
That's a very serious illness.

590
00:26:53,966 --> 00:26:56,333
Uh, sure.

591
00:26:58,804 --> 00:27:02,080
You must have had balls
to survive that hellhole.

592
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,507
Did what I had to...

593
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:05,314
Shapeshifted into whatever monster

594
00:27:05,317 --> 00:27:08,812
would keep the others off my back.

595
00:27:08,814 --> 00:27:11,114
But you know exactly what it's like

596
00:27:11,116 --> 00:27:14,485
pretending to be something
worse than you are to survive.

597
00:27:14,487 --> 00:27:16,620
Well, there's that.

598
00:27:16,622 --> 00:27:19,756
And there's finding someone you trust.

599
00:27:19,758 --> 00:27:23,293
I did time in supermax
with my old partner.

600
00:27:23,295 --> 00:27:25,603
It's harder to plot against a team.

601
00:27:25,606 --> 00:27:28,198
I spent all my time
shapeshifting and running.

602
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,133
I never stuck around
one place long enough

603
00:27:30,135 --> 00:27:32,069
to find anyone that I could trust.

604
00:27:32,071 --> 00:27:35,072
Well, you got to start somewhere.

605
00:27:41,714 --> 00:27:45,215
Hey, it's me, Sara. You
guys still out there?

606
00:27:45,217 --> 00:27:47,826
Sara? Potion actually worked?

607
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:49,096
You didn't know if it was going to work

608
00:27:49,098 --> 00:27:50,658
before you gave us the potion?

609
00:27:50,661 --> 00:27:51,833
Well, of course I didn't.

610
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,502
I never tested it on humans, have I?

611
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,725
Damn it, John.

612
00:27:54,727 --> 00:27:56,217
Well, just see it like
this... You two have now

613
00:27:56,219 --> 00:27:59,028
turned yourselves into
irresistible shtriga bait.

614
00:27:59,031 --> 00:28:01,845
So any suggestions on
how a couple of kids

615
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:04,770
can take on a magical child-eating hag?

616
00:28:04,773 --> 00:28:06,769
Well, if you're in a pinch,

617
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:09,239
you can always try capsicum annuum...

618
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:10,885
More commonly known as cayenne pepper.

619
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:12,042
Witches hate the stuff.

620
00:28:12,044 --> 00:28:13,677
But you'll be fine. Cheers, love.

621
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,345
Great.

622
00:28:15,347 --> 00:28:18,115
But where are we going
to get cayenne pepper?

623
00:28:18,117 --> 00:28:19,550
Follow my lead.

624
00:28:19,552 --> 00:28:22,119
The shtriga's lair can't be far now.

625
00:28:22,121 --> 00:28:23,987
Look, a camper must have tried

626
00:28:23,989 --> 00:28:26,790
to hide from the shtriga here.

627
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:29,560
What are you doing? Oh, a spell?

628
00:28:29,562 --> 00:28:31,895
Yep.

629
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,240
Ah, will-o the wisp.

630
00:28:43,242 --> 00:28:47,110
Little bugger will lead us
to whoever owns that shirt.

631
00:28:47,112 --> 00:28:48,779
Well, go on then, light the way.

632
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:52,549
Ha! Look at us... A pair
of magical detectives.

633
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:54,384
Oh, and I was beginning
to think you were all right

634
00:28:54,386 --> 00:28:56,153
till you went and said that.

635
00:28:56,155 --> 00:28:58,589
You know, there are other
dabblers of the dark arts

636
00:28:58,591 --> 00:29:00,023
out there who think that I'm all right.

637
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:02,159
Referring to Nora Darhk, are we?

638
00:29:02,161 --> 00:29:03,794
You best stay away
from that witch, mate.

639
00:29:03,796 --> 00:29:06,029
Not even your big heart can
keep you safe from someone

640
00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:08,165
who's wrestled with literal demons.

641
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:10,627
What about you? You're one of us now.

642
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,606
You even dressed up for a little while.

643
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:14,575
You've wrestled with
demons, and you're good.

644
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:16,978
Just listen to me, all right?

645
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:20,477
You know, I had a friend like you.

646
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:23,914
Someone good, someone who trusted me.

647
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:26,183
Be smarter than him, all right?

648
00:29:26,185 --> 00:29:27,618
Save yourself, Ray Palmer,

649
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,420
because people like me and Nora Darhk...

650
00:29:30,422 --> 00:29:33,156
we're bloody hell for people like you.

651
00:29:36,261 --> 00:29:37,728
Truth or dare?

652
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,463
Truth.

653
00:29:39,465 --> 00:29:42,199
I... think you meant dare.

654
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:44,201
Dare?

655
00:29:44,203 --> 00:29:46,436
Dare. I mean dare.

656
00:29:46,438 --> 00:29:49,347
I dare you to sneak out of the cabin

657
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,150
and break into the mess hall.

658
00:29:51,153 --> 00:29:53,477
But to prove that you
didn't chicken out,

659
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:55,979
you have to bring us something
back from the kitchen.

660
00:29:55,981 --> 00:29:57,814
Ooh.

661
00:30:09,995 --> 00:30:12,696
Well, this must be the place.

662
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,535
Alexis, who would you
rather have babies with?

663
00:30:18,537 --> 00:30:21,763
Jonathan Taylor Thomas or Mario Lopez?

664
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:23,440
Mm...

665
00:30:23,442 --> 00:30:24,825
I ran into some trouble.

666
00:30:24,828 --> 00:30:26,710
I knew it. She chickened out.

667
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:31,591
I tried to carry more,

668
00:30:31,594 --> 00:30:33,716
but I could only sneak
out with two of these.

669
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:36,118
I know you missed the
ice cream social, so...

670
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:37,988
ice cream social is coming to you.

671
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:39,845
Rocky road and mint chocolate chip...

672
00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:41,792
You're the best ever.

673
00:30:44,129 --> 00:30:48,365
And I have something just for us.

674
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:50,233
That's my girl.

675
00:30:57,142 --> 00:30:59,869
Oh, I've seen enough
horror movie trailers

676
00:30:59,872 --> 00:31:02,479
to know this won't end well.

677
00:31:04,726 --> 00:31:06,883
Those films are nothing
compared to the horrors

678
00:31:06,885 --> 00:31:08,719
you might see in real life.

679
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:25,736
Are we too late?

680
00:31:25,738 --> 00:31:27,637
Uh, we'll need an incantation,

681
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:29,406
a crystal, and a conduit

682
00:31:29,408 --> 00:31:31,486
to draw their pilfered
life force from the shtriga

683
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:32,943
and back into their bodies.

684
00:31:32,945 --> 00:31:36,113
Now, just, uh, follow my
lead and do everything I say.

685
00:31:37,616 --> 00:31:39,049
We really needed this.

686
00:31:39,051 --> 00:31:40,799
Camp's been kind of rough this year.

687
00:31:40,802 --> 00:31:42,786
What do you mean?

688
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:45,956
It's okay. You can talk to us.

689
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:48,892
We're super worried
about Lenise and Meredith.

690
00:31:48,894 --> 00:31:51,428
We didn't want to say
anything for the longest time.

691
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,997
We thought we'd get in
trouble and ruin everything.

692
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:55,465
Ruin what?

693
00:31:55,468 --> 00:31:57,868
The midnight meet-up. It's a tradition.

694
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,669
Every summer, girls take turns

695
00:31:59,671 --> 00:32:02,539
choosing guys they like to
meet up with in the woods.

696
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:04,696
There's a string that
starts near the flagpole,

697
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:06,681
and it leads out into the meeting spot.

698
00:32:06,684 --> 00:32:08,211
It changes every year.

699
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:13,283
So they meet up, and what's
supposed to happen next?

700
00:32:13,285 --> 00:32:16,720
Well, you're supposed to have
your first kiss and come back.

701
00:32:16,722 --> 00:32:19,892
But Lenise and Meredith never came back.

702
00:32:24,096 --> 00:32:26,596
We got to be getting close, right?

703
00:32:30,235 --> 00:32:32,803
What was that?

704
00:32:41,914 --> 00:32:45,148
It's way past lights out.

705
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,918
What punishment should
I cook up for you?

706
00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:55,185
Come here, you two.

707
00:32:55,188 --> 00:32:57,354
Get off me, you crusty old witch!

708
00:32:57,357 --> 00:32:59,255
My eyes!

709
00:33:03,954 --> 00:33:05,720
Is she dead?

710
00:33:07,266 --> 00:33:08,765
All right, our team's dealing

711
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:10,240
with something called a shtriga.

712
00:33:10,243 --> 00:33:12,443
Do you know anything that
could help them fight it?

713
00:33:12,446 --> 00:33:14,103
Oh, a shtriga.

714
00:33:14,106 --> 00:33:16,973
Very intelligent and very deadly.

715
00:33:18,944 --> 00:33:22,145
If you want my help,
it's going to cost you.

716
00:33:22,147 --> 00:33:24,381
Great. Will that come in
the form of another haiku,

717
00:33:24,383 --> 00:33:26,950
or can we expect something
a little more detailed?

718
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,654
What's that? What was that eye thing?

719
00:33:30,656 --> 00:33:34,190
According to legend,
shtrigas are nasty old women,

720
00:33:34,192 --> 00:33:35,625
but the one that I met in prison...

721
00:33:35,627 --> 00:33:38,261
The one that you're looking for...

722
00:33:38,263 --> 00:33:40,063
Is beautiful.

723
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:41,831
And he's a bloke.

724
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,700
Hmm.

725
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:45,669
What the hell are you doing?

726
00:33:45,671 --> 00:33:48,138
Hey, you don't have
another bathroom break

727
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,361
for, oh, that's right, never,

728
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:50,966
since you tried to break my face.

729
00:33:50,969 --> 00:33:53,130
It is now or never.

730
00:33:56,281 --> 00:33:58,548
Fine. Whatever.

731
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,485
Guys, this shtriga thing
is not an old woman.

732
00:34:02,487 --> 00:34:03,888
What's going on out here?

733
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:07,089
You are looking for a
young, handsome dude.

734
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:11,968
Are you ready, big man?

735
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:13,705
On with the show, then.

736
00:34:15,434 --> 00:34:17,667
What did you guys do to her?

737
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:19,235
We didn't do anything.

738
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:21,204
Look, it's not safe
for you guys out here.

739
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:23,340
Okay? You're coming with me.

740
00:34:23,342 --> 00:34:25,108
We can take care of ourselves.

741
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:28,378
You're coming with me
whether you like it or not.

742
00:34:31,016 --> 00:34:32,990
You think you're so tough?

743
00:34:32,993 --> 00:34:35,294
I don't think it. I know it.

744
00:35:50,312 --> 00:35:53,263
It's working.

745
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:55,165
It worked.

746
00:35:57,436 --> 00:36:00,070
Ooh, that was worse than a hangover.

747
00:36:57,707 --> 00:36:59,407
Oh, no.

748
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,435
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on, lad, wake up.

749
00:37:01,438 --> 00:37:03,872
Wake up, lad. Wake up. Come on, son.

750
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:06,008
Damn it.

751
00:37:06,011 --> 00:37:08,212
Bollocks.

752
00:37:08,215 --> 00:37:10,099
I'm not losing another kid.

753
00:37:25,086 --> 00:37:26,986
What are you doing?

754
00:37:41,273 --> 00:37:43,357
John!

755
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,926
John. Come on.

756
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:48,184
John? Come on, John.

757
00:37:48,187 --> 00:37:50,314
John.

758
00:37:53,687 --> 00:37:56,087
Ugh.

759
00:37:56,089 --> 00:37:57,755
Damn it.

760
00:38:00,227 --> 00:38:04,195
Any of you got... Got a light?

761
00:38:04,197 --> 00:38:05,863
- What happened?
- You saved him.

762
00:38:05,865 --> 00:38:07,232
You saved Randall.

763
00:38:07,234 --> 00:38:09,300
Ah, that's good.

764
00:38:09,302 --> 00:38:11,502
I'm gonna get you back to the ship.

765
00:38:11,504 --> 00:38:15,039
I'm not sure how I'm gonna
get the rest of you out.

766
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:16,872
We found you guys.

767
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:19,080
We got worried when you
didn't show up for dinner.

768
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:20,311
Those kids look famished.

769
00:38:20,313 --> 00:38:22,013
Get them water and electrolytes, stat.

770
00:38:22,015 --> 00:38:24,103
And that gurney we just
made out of rope and wood...

771
00:38:24,106 --> 00:38:25,016
Bring it in.

772
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:26,818
Had a hunch it would come in handy.

773
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,177
How did you find us?

774
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,154
Displacement and direction,
just like you taught us.

775
00:38:31,157 --> 00:38:33,322
Good job, Toby.

776
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:44,568
John's potion will be wearing off soon,

777
00:38:44,571 --> 00:38:46,697
and it's back to our normal lives,

778
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,575
where we're only responsible
for babysitting Rory and Gary.

779
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:52,644
I'd like to thank you

780
00:38:52,646 --> 00:38:54,545
for giving me real childhood memories.

781
00:38:54,547 --> 00:38:58,383
To be honest, these memories
have been kind of awful...

782
00:38:58,385 --> 00:39:00,718
mostly awkward, but...

783
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,872
totally awesome.

784
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:03,674
I mean, it wouldn't be childhood

785
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:05,355
without all of the above.

786
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:08,505
I'm happy it was with you.

787
00:39:08,508 --> 00:39:09,874
And considering all the trouble

788
00:39:09,877 --> 00:39:12,229
those kids went through for a kiss...

789
00:39:12,232 --> 00:39:15,533
I'm guessing no childhood
would be complete without one.

790
00:39:33,053 --> 00:39:35,219
Couldn't help but
notice our magical friend

791
00:39:35,221 --> 00:39:37,622
is not where she's supposed to be.

792
00:39:37,624 --> 00:39:39,274
Oh, she's not?

793
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,744
Rory, do you know anything about that?

794
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:43,861
You don't pay me enough

795
00:39:43,863 --> 00:39:45,330
to be a stinkin' prison guard.

796
00:39:45,332 --> 00:39:47,065
I don't pay you anything.

797
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:49,901
Well, I let the fake Amaya go.

798
00:39:49,903 --> 00:39:51,302
Why would you do that?

799
00:39:51,304 --> 00:39:54,005
Oh, in order to...

800
00:39:54,007 --> 00:39:56,874
have an extreme makeover.

801
00:40:01,281 --> 00:40:03,014
Thanks for the shtriga tip.

802
00:40:03,016 --> 00:40:05,650
Well, if you had your
hands full with a shtriga,

803
00:40:05,652 --> 00:40:06,884
I figured you'd need my help

804
00:40:06,886 --> 00:40:08,619
with whatever you plebs face next.

805
00:40:08,622 --> 00:40:11,155
Sounds like a mutually
beneficial partnership.

806
00:40:11,157 --> 00:40:13,157
One condition, though...

807
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:15,893
I never set foot in
that cage ever again.

808
00:40:15,895 --> 00:40:17,028
Got it?

809
00:40:19,032 --> 00:40:22,800
Mr. Constantine's body is
rejecting my treatments.

810
00:40:22,802 --> 00:40:24,469
His odds of survival are bleak.

811
00:40:24,471 --> 00:40:26,838
John, what you did out
there was pretty selfless.

812
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,424
I told you you were good.

813
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:30,675
That's not good for you.

814
00:40:30,677 --> 00:40:32,477
Get some rest, John.

815
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:33,811
Gideon, give him the good stuff.

816
00:40:33,813 --> 00:40:36,013
Oh, Gideon.

817
00:40:36,015 --> 00:40:40,251
That's nice, love. We should party...

818
00:40:40,253 --> 00:40:42,153
He's getting worse.

819
00:40:42,155 --> 00:40:45,390
The magic he used to save that
camper was pretty powerful.

820
00:40:45,392 --> 00:40:47,291
Well, if magic has him on death's door,

821
00:40:47,293 --> 00:40:49,455
then maybe magic can save him.

822
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:51,796
I think I know someone who can help.

823
00:40:51,798 --> 00:40:54,065
But I have no idea how to find her.

824
00:40:59,038 --> 00:41:01,806
Just one final ingredient.

825
00:41:01,808 --> 00:41:07,845
I trust you'll find that
my potion is magical.

826
00:41:07,847 --> 00:41:10,715
Ugh. You call that soup?

827
00:41:12,152 --> 00:41:14,819
Oh, I-I can start over.

828
00:41:14,821 --> 00:41:16,821
The Ren Fair opens in an hour.

829
00:41:16,823 --> 00:41:18,419
You know what? Forget it.

830
00:41:18,422 --> 00:41:20,931
It's not like folks come to
this tent for the food anyways.

831
00:41:20,934 --> 00:41:22,293
I'm sorry?

832
00:41:22,295 --> 00:41:25,329
They come for the lusty wenches.

833
00:41:25,331 --> 00:41:27,732
I'm...

834
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:29,534
I'm a witch.

835
00:41:29,536 --> 00:41:32,177
Okay, well, as long as
it's a lusty witch, okay?

836
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:39,208
