00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:43,065
Thank you for always tolerating
your little sister,

162
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:46,485
even when I did draw all over
your walls when I was five. [chuckles]

163
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,237
- To the class of 2040.
- 2040!

164
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:51,073
[Classmates] Whoo!

165
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,955
[music plays over speakers]

166
00:08:58,122 --> 00:08:59,790
Sorry, is it all right
for me to be here?

167
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,792
I'm sure it's okay.
Hey.

168
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:03,961
I thought you were
still in rehab, Connor.

169
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:05,856
What's the matter, trust fund?

170
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,441
You don't want me
at your fancy little party?

171
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:09,967
As long as you don't
punch anyone or set anything on fire,

172
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:11,092
we'll be okay.

173
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,639
Can we just try to get along
for one night, please?

174
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,142
- Be right back.
- Okay.

175
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,145
Hey, Trev, have you
seen Bianca?

176
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:22,789
She was supposed to be
here an hour ago.

177
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,607
[chuckles] No, I'm not
her keeper anymore.

178
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,543
Okay, I thought you
guys were still cool.

179
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,211
No, we are, but even when
we were together,

180
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,475
she never told me
where she was.

181
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:31,339
But you were the last
to see her, weren't you?

182
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,113
Excuse me?

183
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,634
Your number was
the last one she texted.

184
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,658
Uh, who the hell
are you?

185
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,136
Wait. I-is something wrong
with Bianca?

186
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,286
I don't know. You tell us.

187
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:39,037
Ah...

188
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:43,292
You can't just crash my party
and harass my guests.

189
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:44,459
Do you know who I am?

190
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:45,669
A lot more than you do.

191
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:47,838
We were friends
of your parents.

192
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,091
Then how come I've
never seen either of you before?

193
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,510
Long story and less than
zero time to explain.

194
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,261
Your friend Bianca,
she's in trouble.

195
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,097
And we need your help
to find her.

196
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,557
Yeah. I'm calling security.

197
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:01,977
No, I'm sorry to take
you out of your bubble,

198
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:04,355
but we really need you.

199
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:06,899
[dramatic music]

200
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,929
[Mia] <i>I know
how to protect myself.</i>

201
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:13,572
<i>- You made sure of that.
- I sure did.</i>

202
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,468
[Felicity] <i>The four of you are
the heroes that the city needs.</i>

203
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:17,492
[grunting]

204
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:21,831
[William] <i>We are staring
at our father alive!</i>

205
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,624
[Mia] <i>Dad. So what's next?</i>

206
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,378
[Oliver] <i>Mar Novu has
seen my fate.</i>

207
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:30,047
- Dad...
- [Oliver] <i>I don't survive Crisis.</i>

208
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,426
[intense music]

209
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:39,389
Mia.

210
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,724
- [metal weapon slashes]
- [gasps]

211
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:47,398
- Back off.
- Um, I'm sorry. You fainted.

212
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,204
[William] Are you okay?

213
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:03,663
Oh, my God.

214
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:10,212
Sorry. Uh, sorry. I... I guess
I had too much to drink

215
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,922
without eating or something.

216
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,091
Maybe you should lie down,
party animal.

217
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,634
I think I need some air.

218
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,470
- Hey, Mia, listen...
- Ooh. No.

219
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:29,273
[dramatic music]

220
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:34,695
What the hell did
you do to me?

221
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,614
I would love to know that
myself.

222
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,158
There's this guy,
J'onn J'onzz.

223
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,701
He's a Martian or something.

224
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,787
He's why we remember everything
that happened before the Crisis.

225
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,372
Cisco was able to replicate

226
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,708
the Martian's powers
using tech.

227
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,294
So a friend of
Supergirl's has a power

228
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:51,861
a friend of the Flash
can replicate.

229
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:53,631
Yeah.
That's what I said.

230
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:55,817
[Mia] I want to say that
you guys are crazy

231
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,426
and that none of this
is possible,

232
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,386
but I know you're right.

233
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,513
I remember everything,

234
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,807
you two fighting
alongside my dad,

235
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,517
Zoe dying, my...

236
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,646
my fiancé killing her.

237
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:12,149
[tense music]

238
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:13,901
I remember
my father dying.

239
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,031
Why would you do
this to me?

240
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:20,908
Look, there'll be time
for emotions later.

241
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,744
I woke you up because
your friend Bianca was kidnapped.

242
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:26,580
But there hasn't been any
crime in Star City in 20 years.

243
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,457
What is that, like
the city's motto now?

244
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:30,167
You don't know Bianca,
all right?

245
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:33,003
She's flaky. She's probably on a beach
somewhere having a ball.

246
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:34,546
I saw her, and she
was taken.

247
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:36,047
How are you even
hesitating?

248
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:37,688
Aren't you supposed
to be the Green Arrow?

249
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,551
Not anymore.

250
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,280
[Dinah] Mia, I understand
that you are torn

251
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,555
between two worlds
right now,

252
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:44,722
but we need your help.

253
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:47,434
Look, I don't even know
if I can do this anymore, okay?

254
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:48,936
I haven't trained. I don't...

255
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:51,397
[dramatic music]

256
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,316
See?
Just like riding a bike.

257
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,320
Is Bianca actually
in trouble?

258
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:01,699
[Dinah] Yes. And if we don't
find her, she's going to die.

259
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:05,035
Fine. I will help you.

260
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,413
But this is
a one-time thing.

261
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,623
Okay, I'm not interested
in joining

262
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,041
your Canary club, all right?

263
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,252
I have a life now,
I am happy,

264
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:14,938
and I would like to
keep it that way.

265
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:15,962
Whatever.

266
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,530
Where was Bianca
when she was taken?

267
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,091
Partying at Club V.

268
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,885
Nothing Bianca loved more
than a good party.

269
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,304
Oh, to be in my
20s again.

270
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,849
Ick. Hard pass.
I was married at 21.

271
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,768
Seriously?
Who are you?

272
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:32,396
Bianca.
She was adopted.

273
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,064
Any chance that
created tension?

274
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,900
Helena was a great mom
before she disappeared.

275
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,871
She lives with her
great-aunt and uncle now.

276
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,826
Back in the old Star City,
the Bertinellis were

277
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,546
one of the biggest
crime families around.

278
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,098
Well, that sounds
like enough reason

279
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,118
to violate some
privacy laws.

280
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,495
It's time for you

281
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,581
to pay that family
a little visit.

282
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,087
I'm sorry Bianca missed your party.
You know how she is.

283
00:13:57,338 --> 00:13:58,464
Free spirit.

284
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:00,257
Totally. Actually,

285
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,426
I wanted to speak
with you about that.

286
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,138
I think Bianca might be
in some kind of trouble.

287
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,639
What kind of trouble?

288
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,976
Mia's in position.
D, you're up.

289
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,906
- [Laurel on comms] <i>You ready?</i>
- Never not.

290
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,356
I think Bianca might
have been taken.

291
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,816
[Mr. Bertinelli laughs]
That's ridiculous.

292
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,193
You know how safe it is here.

293
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,153
I haven't been able
to contact her in days.

294
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,680
Her social media is quiet, it's...

295
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,090
she's not even
posting those videos

296
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,366
she's always
addicted to making.

297
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,532
I wouldn't worry
about it.

298
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,011
In a couple days,
we're gonna find out

299
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,578
she's been, uh,
what partying

300
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,465
off the coast of
Corto Maltese or something.

301
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,464
[Laurel on comms]
<i>Dinah, what's your progress?</i>

302
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,541
Three more rooms to go.

303
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,687
- You're about to have company,
- [tablet beeping]

304
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:38,962
one of the help,
I'm guessing.

305
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,173
Mia, we need a distraction.

306
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,302
Wouldn't it be better
to be safe than sorry?

307
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:47,346
I mean, maybe since
we're here,

308
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,556
if we call the police...
oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

309
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,043
[Mr. Bertinelli] Logan, get Remy!

310
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,684
[Logan] Remy?

311
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,440
Remy, we've got
an emergency.

312
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,655
[Mr. Bertinelli] Do us a favor.
Stop worrying about Bianca.

313
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:05,905
She's fine.

314
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:07,282
Okay, I will.

315
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:08,781
- [comms beep]
- I'm clear.

316

Oh, he'll get over it.

selfish you're being?

Me? You're the one
who's using my friend

to drag me and Dinah back
into this superhero crap

553
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:06,589

the fact that Star City's fine

be the Black Canary anymore.

And here I thought making
you remember your old life

00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:14,347
would open your eyes to how
pointless and stupid

your new one is.

himself to give me.

trivialize that.

[Dinah] Okay, I think
all Laurel was trying to say

562
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,736
is that Bianca is out there,
and she's in danger.

563
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:27,901
Bianca is fine.

You had no right
to make me remember.

566
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:38,705
All that did is bring back
the suffering and the loss,

567
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:41,583
because that's
all being a hero is.

568
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:51,009
I would've met you at
your place.

your event too badly.

I wish it was just
the event that you'd screwed up.

JJ, I'm sorry.

573
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,065
You accused me of
kidnapping our friend.

574
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:08,466
How in the world do you think
I could do something like that?

575
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:10,904
You were keeping
things from me.

is I'm cheating on you,

not that I'm a kidnapper.

I'm neither.

Can we please just go
back to a time

before I accused you
of being a criminal?

What are you talking
about?

You have never really
had to commit to anything in your life.

589
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,435
[JJ] That's why you brush off
your brother's job offers.

590
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:45,271
And it's why you hesitated
saying yes to our proposal.

591

[stammering] It's why you're pushing me
away right now.

You don't want to
marry me.

That is not true.

Then how come ever since
the party...

595
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:56,074
ever since I proposed
to you, i-it's like

598
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,670
When I look at you,
I see the rest of my life.

599
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,465
I can't marry someone
who doesn't feel the same.

00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,300
- John, please.
- No. I... no.

601
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,846
I think it's best
we take some space.

something on that video.

Our hunch was right.

606

There's evidence
the image was altered.

I'm running a decryption program,
but it's gonna take a bit.

608
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:38,032
Since when did you learn to do all
this Felicity stuff?

609
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:41,077
I was a police captain,
Laurel. I have tricks.

610
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,289
Like knowing when someone's
not telling me everything,

611
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:45,498
for example.

612
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,124
Like you.

613

What?

614
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:51,963
You've been pushing Mia
real hard, which is weird,

615
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,841
because normally, you keep a fairly
healthy snark-filled distance

616
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,593
from caring too much
about anything.

617
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:58,427
This is personal.

618
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:00,014
Look, I wasted
a lot of time

619
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,973
pretending to
be something I wasn't

620
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,934
because it was easier, and
I don't want Mia making the same mistake.

You...
[exhales]

622

You know, part of empathy isn't only
understanding other people's pain.

623
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:13,776
It's also sharing your own.
You know how hard it is to be a hero.

624
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,159
I mean, hell, I'm struggling
with it right now.

Imagine what she's
going through.

[Dinah] <i>Any word
on how Bianca's doing?</i>

801
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:12,088
She is back to her old self,
posting live videos.

802
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,134
So I'm not very good at
this, uh, feelings stuff.

803
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:20,554
I wanted to thank you,
both of you.

804
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:23,933
And now you can go back
to your glamorous life

805
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,185
of singing to drunk
hipsters in your bar.

806
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:27,436
Oh, thank you for that.

807
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,856
But, uh, actually, I was
thinking of going part-time.

808
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:34,652
You know, Trevor's not just
a jealous ex-lover trying to get even.

809
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,195
Somebody pushed him
to do this,

810
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:38,280
and we still haven't
figured out who or why.

811
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:40,366
[Mia] Trevor's tattoo
looked familiar.

812
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,117
We start there.

813
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:43,118
We?

814
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:47,081
Star City needs
the Green Arrow.

815
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:50,167
[Dinah] But what about JJ,
and what about your life?

816
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:51,419
I'm not giving that up,

817
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:54,213
but I'm also gonna protect
my father's legacy.

818
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,549
Mia, living a double life
is really hard.

819
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:58,509
Well, somebody once
told me that

820
00:36:58,676 --> 00:37:01,554
being a hero is
the hardest thing you can do.

821
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:04,139
It's also
the right thing.

822
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:06,892
Well, that person
sounds really smart.

823
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:08,139
I mean, she has
her moments.

824
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:10,980
But putting on
that suit again wasn't easy.

825
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:14,316
But it reminded me
that it's not all bad.

826
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:18,529
There are some really,
really good parts, too.

827
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:24,452
Well, uh, before we get
back to saving the world,

828
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:26,662
I say we should have
a celebratory drink.

829
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,748
And after what we did
tonight,

830
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:30,708
I say we deserve
the good stuff.

831
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:33,794
Cheers. To the Green Arrow.

832
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:35,503
To the Canaries.

833
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:38,758
To the future,
whatever it holds.

[glasses clink]

835
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:46,426
Well, I'm glad you didn't
change the locks on me yet.

836
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:47,475
Mia...

837
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:50,728
Look, before you kick me out,
just please let me say I'm sorry.

838
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:56,066
You were right. I... I have been acting
weird since the graduation party.

839
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:58,569
- So then I did spook you.
- No.

840
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:01,155
This has nothing to do
with you proposing.

841
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:06,869
Look, graduating
got into my head.

842
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:11,040
I'm trying to figure out what I want to do
with the rest of my life,

843
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,543
what kind of person
I want to be. I...

844
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:19,624
I want to help you with that.

845
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:22,426
And that is why I
love you so much.

846
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,845
You're a good
person, JJ.

847
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,849
I couldn't imagine spending my life
with anyone else.

848
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:31,477
[tender music]

849
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:40,611
You know, it's been a while
since I had a roommate.

850
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,322
I'll get my own place,
I promise.

851
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:46,242
Your own place?
That sounds pretty permanent.

852
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:49,761
The city's under threat,
and I'm not gonna leave until it's over.

853
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:52,039
You know, while you're here,

854
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:54,333
we could turn this place
into a base of operations

855
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,458
for the Canaries.

856
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:58,045
Canaries, as in more
than just us?

857
00:39:00,464 --> 00:39:03,092
Tonight made me remember
who I really am, Laurel.

858
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:06,470
I may have been erased,
but I'm not gone.

859
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:08,848
[Dinah] I need to figure out
how I got here.

860
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:12,810
And while I do that, I can help a whole
new generation of women.

861
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:18,065
So basically,
what you're saying is

862
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:19,942
that I was right.

863
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:21,986
Don't gloat.

864
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,905
But please do explain why
you didn't tell me

865
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:27,912
the whole story about what Bianca's death
would have meant for the city.

Sara said
when the city falls...

867
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:37,960
someone's at
the center of it... Mia.

868
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,670
But Bianca was dead
in the future,

869
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:41,255
and Mia wasn't
the Green Arrow.

870
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:43,995
We should be
in the clear, right?

871
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:46,010
I hope so.

872
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:55,213
I can't believe it's
been 20 years

himself to save the city.

<i>Byline</i>, channel 52.

878
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:08,374
They all want to know
if I'm the Green Arrow.

879
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:10,033
Course they do.

880

Isn't it a little
misogynistic

881
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:12,888
that they're not calling
you as well?
