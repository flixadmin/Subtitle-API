1
00:00:02,837 --> 00:00:05,294
I can have Norwegian friends
and still be myself.

2
00:00:06,861 --> 00:00:09,812
We are looking for someone
who wants to buy our bus.

3
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:12,969
There is only one other bus
that's coming to take a look.

4
00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:15,073
The Pepsi Max Squad.

5
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:22,199
I feel like we are more like you, guys.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,700
Cool, normal, Norwegian party girls.

7
00:00:26,523 --> 00:00:27,182
We will get that bus.

8
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:28,557
We don't have the money!

9
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:30,451
I'll fix it!

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,690
Who is that?

11
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,141
SATURDAY
11:31

12
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,442
What’s that, bro? What are you doing?

13
00:00:47,443 --> 00:00:48,763
Throw it to me! Throw it to me!

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,240
Hello.

15
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,764
Hi, love.

16
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:00,735
Where is dad?

17
00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:03,454
At La Mocca.

18
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:08,300
Let’s play with the ball.
Play it with your feet.

19
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:11,561
There were a lot of people asking
for you at Friday's prayer.

20
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:20,583
Oh, yeah. I was supposed to
go, but I couldn’t make it.

21
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,982
No. But it’s been a while.

22
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:29,991
It’s not been that long.

23
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:35,615
Why do you never say that to Elias?

24
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:37,188
He is never at Friday's prayer.

25
00:01:38,696 --> 00:01:42,596
No, right... Elias is just as
lightheaded as your father.

26
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,220
While the two of us, we are
a little more focused.

27
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:50,966
Don’t you agree?

28
00:01:52,443 --> 00:01:53,923
I’ll be there next Friday.

29
00:01:54,819 --> 00:02:00,273
We are going to Mahmoud’s
wedding next Friday.

30
00:02:00,797 --> 00:02:01,997
Do you want to come?

31
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,110
No, thank you. I think I will pass.

32
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:14,935
So, what did you do yesterday?

33
00:02:17,124 --> 00:02:18,124
Yesterday?

34
00:02:18,436 --> 00:02:19,436
Mhmm

35
00:02:20,918 --> 00:02:24,433
I just hung out with Noora
and Eva and all them.

36
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:26,457
But, do you need any help cooking?

37
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,620
You want to help me cook?

38
00:02:29,853 --> 00:02:31,589
No. Not really.

39
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,344
“No, not really?”

40
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:39,068
Honestly, what are you going
to do when you get married?

41
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,392
Are you going to let your children starve?

42
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:44,806
No. My husband is going to cook.

43
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,427
Your husband is going to cook?

44
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:50,051
 Huh. Inshallah.

45
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:56,807
Hello? Hi.

46
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:40,632
Hi.

47
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,770
Hi!

48
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,975
I’m just getting something to drink.

49
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:23,835
Do you need any help?

50
00:04:24,686 --> 00:04:25,697
Huh? No.

51
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,718
Listen.

52
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:40,942
I don’t want to be rude but...

53
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,000
you are doing it all wrong.

54
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,090
Like, completely, completely wrong.

55
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:49,599
Oh, yeah?

56
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:50,738
Should I show you?

57
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:52,739
Okay.

58
00:04:57,119 --> 00:05:00,419
You need to drag it towards
yourself, not push it away.

59
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,798
Okay?

60
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,120
Otherwise you will make a mess

61
00:05:04,195 --> 00:05:06,517
and you won’t have any
control over the carrot.

62
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:08,955
Pull it towards yourself.

63
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,290
Then you turn it over
and do the other side.

64
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:19,488
Wow.

65
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:31,916
How did you get so good at peeling carrots?

66
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,866
I work in a kindergarten.

67
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:37,357
So I peel a lot of things for the kids.

68
00:05:40,278 --> 00:05:41,658
Do you work in a kindergarten?

69
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:42,501
Yes.

70
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,190
So, do you like kids then?

71
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,507
Yes, of course!

72
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:53,131
Don’t you?

73
00:05:58,465 --> 00:06:00,176
How can you not like kids?

74
00:06:03,602 --> 00:06:04,977
I like kids...

75
00:06:05,378 --> 00:06:07,255
Well, how many do you want?

76
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:15,520
Two, maybe?

77
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,539
Two?! Two kids!

78
00:06:17,763 --> 00:06:19,463
Okay, two kids.

79
00:06:20,878 --> 00:06:22,318
Then you don’t really like kids.

80
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,911
How many are you going to have then?

81
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:25,885
Twelve!

82
00:06:27,443 --> 00:06:28,292
Twelve kids?!

83
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,880
Yeah.

84
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:29,904
I am thinking long term.

85
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:32,128
I will make a football team with them.

86
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,510
There are eleven people on a football team.

87
00:06:39,828 --> 00:06:41,928
- Are there eleven people on a team?
- Yeah.

88
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:44,345
Or are there eleven people
on the field, maybe?

89
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:45,976
What if someone gets hurt?

90
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:48,969
Exactly.

91
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:49,598
Yeah.

92
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:52,650
Exactly. You hadn’t thought about that!

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,200
Do you want to try?

94
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,300
There.

95
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:14,678
Don’t keep peeling outwards!
You need to peel it inwards.

96
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:18,477
Drag it towards you! Try!

97
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:21,837
Use you thumb. Use your thumb.

98
00:07:21,838 --> 00:07:22,467
My thumb?

99
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:23,502
Yes, use your thumb.

100
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,426
And drag, yeah, just like that.

101
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,250
Fine.

102
00:07:27,774 --> 00:07:28,973
Easier?

103
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:32,656
Much better now.

104
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,113
What’s happening here?

105
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:38,246
I’m drinking some juice.

106
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,189
Weren’t you going to get
a drink and come back?

107
00:07:42,826 --> 00:07:45,501
Yeah, but your sister doesn’t
know how to peel carrots.

108
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:47,168
You haven’t taught her properly, man!

109
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,970
- I don’t care about cooking.
- But Elias...

110
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:52,054
No. The boys are waiting. Stop
flirting with my sister, man.

111
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:54,437
Flirting, dude? I’m fixing
the food for tonight.

112
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,509
Come on. Let’s get out of here.

113
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,050
VILDE: MARI CALLED, WE GOT
THE BUS FOR 300,000!!!!!

114
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,775
NOORA: CALL AND SAY WE DON’T WANT IT.

115
00:08:13,798 --> 00:08:16,548
VILDE: SANA SAID SHE WILL
FIX IT, SO SHE WILL FIX IT.

116
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,850
DON’T YOU REMEMBER THE
PAPER ROLLS LAST YEAR?

117
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,670
SHE FIXES EVERYTHING! SANA
IS THE BOSS. RIGHT, SANA?

118
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,340

LENDER’S APPLICATION IS FREE

121
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:53,769
YOUSEF - I’M HURT BECAUSE YOU
NEVER REPLIED TO MY MEME

122
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:11,257
THE KIDS AROUND YOU ARE HURT BECAUSE
YOU ARE CHATTING DURING WORK TIME

123
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:24,406
HAH! I’M FREE ON MONDAYS. YOU
THOUGHT YOU WERE SMART NOW.

124
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,900
HOW IS THE RUSS BUSS?

125
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:44,000
IT’S GOING GREAT IF YOU TELL ME
HOW TO EARN 300,000 KRONE FAST.

126
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:46,025
Hi!

127
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:53,426
We heard you got the bus.

128
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,450
Congratulations!

129
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:57,496
Thanks.

130
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,645
So we were wondering...

131
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,961
Would you want to join us?

132
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:18,549
We just thought that you
are 5 and we are 20.

133
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:20,861
There are 25 seats on the bus.

134
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:23,385
Perhaps it could be a match?

135
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:33,759
We know that maybe we haven’t
been the world’s best friends,

136
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,260
but we don’t really understand why.

137
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:41,106
Because you called Vilde a slut at
Borkis’ bus pre-grame in October 2015.

138
00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:43,823
Right.

139
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:48,764
I had completely forgotten about that.

140
00:10:48,788 --> 00:10:50,088
But I apologize.

141
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:03,882
We’ll merge our buses...

142
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,306
on two conditions.

143
00:11:08,562 --> 00:11:09,462
Okay?

144
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:13,236
You pay for the bus and
I become the bus boss.

145
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:21,436
We have to discuss that
with the other girls...

146
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,253
Either we make the deal now
or there won’t be a bus.

147
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:35,996
Yeah.

148
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:37,434
Okay.

149
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:40,258
We are in.

150
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:41,914
Good!

151
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:45,962
Send me the name of everyone on the bus
and I will invite you to a bus meeting.

152
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:53,438
Okay?

153
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,046
What did they want?

154
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,491
Have you talked with them?

155
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:12,992
I have news. Where is Chris?

156
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:15,311
She is in Berlin. What’s up?

157
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:23,375
We have merged with the Pepsi-Max.

158
00:12:23,648 --> 00:12:24,748
Are you joking?

159
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:26,269
What does that mean?

160
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:30,216
They spend money on the bus
and I become the bus boss.

161
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:31,903
Why are you the bus boss?

162
00:12:32,004 --> 00:12:35,204
Would we get along with the Pepsi Max?

163
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:37,162
Either we join with Pepsi Max group

164
00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:39,186
or there won’t be a bus.

165
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,810
So we have a bus meeting this week.

166
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,000
Eva, can you host?

167
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:46,468
I can’t host again. Like, ever!

168
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,311
Noora, kollektivet?

169
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:50,814
Those girls are not going
into my apartment.

170
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:52,217
Vilde?

171
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:53,541
No, my mom...

172
00:12:54,218 --> 00:12:56,698
Your mom is not having a
wine tasting party, Vilde.

173
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,821
Why can’t you host for once?

174
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,560
TUESDAY
19:05

175
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:18,738
HOW TO SUCCEED WITH A GOOD
NAME AND RUSS BUS CONCEPT

176
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:21,862
THE IDEA BEHIND THE NAME
MAKES A LOT ABOUT PROMOTION

177
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:40,360
BUS MEETING. COVER NAME. LOTS OF PROMO

178
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:41,884
MIX MYSTERIOUS WITH HUMOR

179
00:13:42,008 --> 00:13:44,508
MAIN CONCEPT AND NAME
MUST BE CONNECTED

180
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:59,235
YOUSEF: DID YOU GET THE 300,000?

181
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:04,162
EASY

182
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,079
YOUSEF: ARE YOU JOKING?!?!?!?

183
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:08,132
Hi!

184
00:14:09,094 --> 00:14:10,094
Hello!

185
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:12,046
Gone to bed already?

186
00:14:12,905 --> 00:14:13,905
No.

187
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:21,924
Do you need that cup or
are you done with it?

188
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:23,578
I’m done.

189
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,000
Listen, Mom?

190
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,500
Yes?

191
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:48,223
I was wondering if I could invite
some girls to come over on Friday?

192
00:14:49,185 --> 00:14:50,185
Yes.

193
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:51,785
Yes, is that fine?

194
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:52,576
Yes.

195
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It is.

196
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,800
How many are you?

197
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:00,707
Or are you not that many?

198
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:02,894
Not that many.

199
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:04,293
No?

200
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:06,317
What are you going to do?

201
00:15:08,431 --> 00:15:09,649
Mhmmmm

202
00:15:12,093 --> 00:15:14,393
I ask too much. Don’t I?

203
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:16,999
I do, right?

204
00:15:18,947 --> 00:15:19,947
No.

205
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,832
But that doesn’t mean
that I don’t trust you.

206
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:23,923
I do.

207
00:15:24,947 --> 00:15:27,147
I just miss talking with you.

208
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,858
You used to tell me all your secrets.

209
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:41,499
Do you remember that?

210
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,400
Do you want to hear a secret now?

211
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:56,085
Yes.

212
00:16:01,425 --> 00:16:04,275
There is a boy I like.

213
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:07,005
Muslim?

214
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,091
Yes.

215
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:10,073
Tell me more.

216
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:19,370
He is funny and smart.

217
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:21,395
Good looking?

218
00:16:21,768 --> 00:16:23,408
Yes, really handsome.

219
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:28,705
And I even think he can cook.

220
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,750
Perfect for you!

221
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,390
Yeah!

222
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
Do you think I can meet him?

223
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,800
I don’t think we are there quite yet.

224
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,000
I have only talked to him a little.

225
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,099
And...

226
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,200
I don’t even know if he likes me.

227
00:16:54,253 --> 00:16:56,298
If he likes you?!

228
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,570
Of course he likes you!

229
00:16:58,646 --> 00:17:00,646
Who doesn’t like you?

230
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:05,411
Do you think so?

231
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,630
Yes, I do.

232
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,750
I hope so.

233
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,800
THURSDAY
10:04

234
00:17:20,824 --> 00:17:22,424
BITCH!!!

235
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:39,253
MOM: ARE YOU GOING TO
SERVE ANYTHING ON FRIDAY?

236
00:17:39,277 --> 00:17:42,015
DAD AND I WILL GET HOME LATE BUT
I CAN MAKE SOMETHING TO HEAT UP?

237
00:17:42,016 --> 00:17:46,747
SARA: IS IT OKAY ALCOHOL FOR THE BUS MEETING?

238
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:47,748
Hello.

239
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:49,681
Hi!

240
00:17:49,749 --> 00:17:50,749
Everything good?

241
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,310
Yeah!

242
00:17:56,265 --> 00:18:00,845
I heard you talked to
Isak about Mikael.

243
00:18:05,344 --> 00:18:09,144
Oh, yeah! He saw a picture
of Mikael on my Facebook.

244
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,400
Okay?

245
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,045
We didn’t talk about him or anything.

246
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
How are the boys doing?

247
00:18:32,518 --> 00:18:33,518
Good.

248
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:36,885
What’s Elias doing these days?

249
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:43,084
Elias? He is taking a gap year.
Messing around, as usual.

250
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,890
Living off mom and dad.

251
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:50,758
You have to say hi to your mom and
tell her I miss her shebbakiyya.

252
00:18:51,306 --> 00:18:51,887
I will.

253
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,600
Hello.

254
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,169
Hi!

255
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:59,093
I was just asking Sana where you were.

256
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:01,461
Yeah, I am here.

257
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:04,331
Are you joining Jonas and I for McDonald’s?

258
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:04,890
Of course!

259
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:06,372
Lovely. Are you joining?

260
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,079
No, thank you.

261
00:19:08,471 --> 00:19:09,762
Okay. Should we go now?

262
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:11,242
Yes.

263
00:19:12,922 --> 00:19:13,471
Good bye!

264
00:19:13,508 --> 00:19:16,931
Bye! Talk to you later.

265
00:19:26,192 --> 00:19:28,192
FRIDAY
19:43

266
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:30,817
That’s why I think we
should be very ambitious

267
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:35,241
and a clear goal should be to win
at least one of the bus prizes

268
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:36,965
at Tryvann in May 2018.

269
00:19:38,689 --> 00:19:39,689
Yes?

270
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:44,088
It’s pretty easy to say that you want to
win prizes, everyone wants to do that.

271
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,700
Now that you are the buss boss. Do
you have a plan on how to do that?

272
00:19:48,764 --> 00:19:54,164
To start, I have had a look at your
budget and it needs to be redistributed.

273
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,100
For example...

274
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,500
there is not point in trying to compete
in lighting and sound rigging,

275
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,650
because then we are going to lose.

276
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,200
But what we can be
competitive in, is concept.

277
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:11,324
So the first thing I am going to do is to

278
00:20:11,348 --> 00:20:14,948
move our resources from the
light and sound section

279
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,950
to the concept section.

280
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:22,907
I am sorry, but it is very hard
to win year’s best concept.

281
00:20:23,226 --> 00:20:23,826
Yeah.

282
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,650
But if you do an analysis of the buses
that have won in the past three years,

283
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,170
you will see some obvious
things on common aspects.

284
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,810
The League 2014, a boy’s bus from Bærum with
a Pokeball bar and Pokémon decorations.

285
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,400
Montana 2015, a boy’s bus from Oslo-West

286
00:20:39,424 --> 00:20:41,424
that put together three
versions of Montana.

287
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:44,825
Tony Montana, Hannah Montana
and the state of Montana.

288
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:47,759
Also we have Landslaget 2016,

289
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:51,083
inspired by football
spirit and nationalism.

290
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,930
Do you see what those
buses have in common?

291
00:21:01,704 --> 00:21:06,204
All the concepts suck and we can do better.

292
00:21:08,688 --> 00:21:12,088
To start, I will call all the
bus bosses for a meeting

293
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,200
where we plan what we are going
to do for the next six months

294
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
with some clear goals.

295
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Any more questions?

296
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,200
Yes?

297
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,498
Well, so...

298
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,500
the Russ period is all about
partying and drinking,

299
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,500
and I have to ask, since you are muslim.

300
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What do you think about drinking?

301
00:21:46,862 --> 00:21:48,337
I judge no one.

302
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,501
So, can we drink?

303
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,920
When were your parents
coming back home?

304
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,659
Tomorrow morning...

305
00:22:41,013 --> 00:22:42,213
I think.

306
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,737
They are at a Moroccan wedding.

307
00:22:51,258 --> 00:22:53,658
It’s good to know.

308
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,600
ARE YOU HAVING A NICE
TIME AT THE WEDDING?

309
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,110
Sana?!?!

310
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:22,461
What’s happening here?

311
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,250
You know mum and dad are here?

312
00:23:26,328 --> 00:23:26,928
Huh?!

313
00:23:26,994 --> 00:23:28,994
They are down with the
neighbours, by the car.

314
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,400
DAD DIDN’T FEEL WELL, SO
WE ARE COMING HOME NOW.

315
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,010
DO YOU STILL HAVE GUESTS?

316
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,635
Okay. Everyone has to get out now!!!

317
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,800
Come on!!! Are you deaf or what?

318
00:23:43,293 --> 00:23:43,633
Now!

319
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,700
Out, out, out! Come on, out!

320
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,600
Get out! Come here!

321
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,800
Close the door. Get
that bottle over there!

322
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
Which key?

323
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
Hi!

324
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,550
Hello. All good?

325
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,410
Yes. We are good.

326
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,434
We ran into Mikael and Adam outside.

327
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,850
Yeah, we were about to meet them.

328
00:24:42,253 --> 00:24:43,453
Fine.

329
00:24:44,101 --> 00:24:45,101
Where is Sana?

330
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,233
In the living room.

331
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:47,551
Hello!

332
00:24:47,582 --> 00:24:48,814
Hi! Did you have a nice time?

333
00:24:48,815 --> 00:24:51,224
Yeah!

334
00:24:53,382 --> 00:24:54,382
It was fine.

335
00:24:55,836 --> 00:24:56,836
What’s this?

336
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,400
That’s...

337
00:25:01,424 --> 00:25:02,824
Vodka?

338
00:25:02,944 --> 00:25:04,856
Vodka? Whose is it?

339
00:25:06,226 --> 00:25:07,226
It’s not yours?

340
00:25:07,295 --> 00:25:08,392
- No...
- Whose?!

341
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,000
It’s mine. Or, it’s not mine but...

342
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:14,071
Do you drink, Yousef?

343
00:25:14,072 --> 00:25:16,965
No. I bought it for a friend.

344
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:18,667
You bought it for a friend?

345
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,200
Yes.

346
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,520
And then we find it here?

347
00:25:21,055 --> 00:25:23,455
You know we don’t have that
kind of things in this house.

348
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:28,441
Yes, I am sorry. I...

349
00:25:57,503 --> 00:26:03,003
THANKS

350
00:26:10,226 --> 00:26:15,826
NO WORRIES

351
00:26:18,265 --> 00:26:26,865
I WILL FIND A WAY TO CONVINCE
MOM YOU ARE A GOOD MUSLIM

352
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:32,370
EVEN THOUGH YOU DRINK VODKA

353
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:49,589
HAHAHA. THAT’S OKAY,
I AM NOT A MUSLIM.

354
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:57,960
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

355
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:18,836
I DON’T BELIEVE IN ALLAH

356
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:50,000
