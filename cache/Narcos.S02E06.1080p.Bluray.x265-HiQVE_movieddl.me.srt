- Hmm?

the Cali cartel. It would be a mistake.

motivate them.

00:09:14,016 --> 00:09:20,939
There must and will be a clear line
between them and us.

- (All) Yes, Colonel.

Escobar's got a lot of enemies.

I heard from Messina this morning.
There's a lot of eyes on them and us,

127
00:09:38,707 --> 00:09:41,168
so she wants us to steer clear.

128

Are you working for Los Pepes, Murphy?

129

No, I'm not.

(Arguing in Spanish)

157
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:42,122
Shh! Don't make me kill you
in front of your mother.

158
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:43,373
Don'<i>t</i> touch her!

159
00:11:43,498 --> 00:11:45,709
Relax, mother, relax.

160
00:11:46,627 --> 00:11:49,213
(Steve) 'It was slow-going.'

161
00:11:49,338 --> 00:11:52,257
(Martinez in Spanish) If you don'<i>t</i>
cooperate, we can'<i>t</i> find your son.

162
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:56,136
But I don'<i>t</i> know where he is.
I didn't notice anything.

163
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:58,513
Do you have enemies here
in the neighbourhood?

164
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,725
I don'<i>t</i> know.
It was my fault that he was here.

165
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,935
He came to see his mother...

166
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,230
(In English) We're too late.
Says they already got him.

167
00:12:12,236 --> 00:12:17,241
We finally get corroboration on Jairo,
Martinez orders the raid...

168
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,618
So?

169
00:12:19,743 --> 00:12:22,913
Well, so, how does Los Pepes
get here first?

170
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:27,292
Maybe he got followed.

171
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:31,463
Or the dumb fuck shot his mouth off
and somebody else got lucky.

172
00:12:31,588 --> 00:12:34,758
Mmm. That's it?
That's all you got to say on that?

173
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:37,636
Yeah.

174
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,558
If it worries you, look into <i>it.</i>

175
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:48,355
(Steve) '"Look into it"? Right.

176
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:52,442

179

'The terror that Pablo had spread
across the country

180

(Carlos in Spanish)
What did you ask Santa for?

184
00:13:11,545 --> 00:13:13,171
- (Juan Pablo) A game.
- Which one?

185
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:16,591
- (Juan Pablo) The Joker game.
- You think he'll bring it to you?

186
00:13:16,717 --> 00:13:17,926
(Juan Pablo) Dad?

187
00:13:18,051 --> 00:13:21,013
Santa is going to bring me
the Joker game, right?

188
00:13:23,056 --> 00:13:25,684
Dad? Dad?

189
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:27,436
Pablo, my love?

190
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:32,149
Of course, Santa will bring you
everything you want, like always.

191
00:13:32,274 --> 00:13:34,276
Christmas without Christ.

192
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,198
Pablo.

193
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:44,578
I'm planning on going to the advent
service tomorrow with the kids.

194
00:13:44,703 --> 00:13:46,913
What? No.
No one should leave this house.

195
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:49,499
I'm sure the kids would love
to see the lights, Pablo.

196
00:13:49,624 --> 00:13:51,710
(Tata) The children are staying here
and so are you.

197
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:54,171
(Hermilda) Remember the first time
you saw the fireworks?

198
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:57,758
My love, can you tell your mother
she can'<i>t</i> take the children to Medellín?

199
00:13:57,883 --> 00:14:00,218
(Pablo) Mama, it's best for us
to stay here.

200
00:14:00,344 --> 00:14:02,262
It's been a month
since I've gone to church.

201
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:05,307
I'm sure that God
can hear your prayers from here.

202
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:06,558
(Blackie) Don Pablo.

203
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:17,861
Boss, they killed three more
of our men.

204
00:14:17,986 --> 00:14:21,156
They found Jairo dead
next to the river.

205
00:14:22,616 --> 00:14:26,953
- (Low chatter)
- Look, it's the Baccarat Crystal.

206
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:28,163
- Thank you.
- Oh!

207
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:31,792
- That's also Baccarat Crystal.
- Feel the weight. Look...

208
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,043
(Woman taps on crystal)

209
00:14:33,168 --> 00:14:37,255
You can feel it's Baccarat.
This is from the Lloredas, right?

210
00:14:37,381 --> 00:14:38,882
How's it going, my love?

211
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:41,676
My love, look at what
the Lloredas brought.

212
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:46,515
- Look, there's two.
- The Lloredas always treat us <i>well...</i>

(Gilberto) 'As gratifying
as these displays may feel,'

216
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,985
I'm not comfortable with these signs.

217
00:14:59,611 --> 00:15:02,364
They invite too much attention
and will lead to questions.

218
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:06,410
Our objective is to eliminate Escobar
as efficiently and discreetly as possible.

219
00:15:07,202 --> 00:15:08,662
Without a doubt.

220
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:19,881
No more proclamations or manifestos
or letters to the media.

221
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:22,134
What about Miami?

222
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:26,680
We buy time.

223
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:29,391
Let him think he still has control.

224
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:31,935
Until the moment we take it from him.

225

give us anything good for Christmas?

228
00:15:51,538 --> 00:15:54,541
Well, Blackie's been getting calls
from Envigado.

229
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,627
The son of a bitch
has got a girlfriend.

230
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:04,885
Here, I'll give that to Martinez.
I'm sure it's gotta get vetted.

231
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,761
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

232
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,023
(Line ringing)

233
00:16:18,148 --> 00:16:19,900
(Berna in Spanish)
'What do you have for me?'

234
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:21,985
I got something new.

235
00:16:22,444 --> 00:16:25,947
- 'Blackie.'
- I like the way this is going, Javier.

236
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:29,743
He's got a girlfriend. She's pregnant,
keeps calling. They're vetting it now.

237
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:33,747
It'll take a while.
Blackie's going to show.

238
00:16:33,872 --> 00:16:35,540
'It's done.'

239
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,169
(Steve) 'I didn'<i>t</i> know how Los Pepes
was beating us to the punch.

'was gonna have any kind of impact
on the hunt for Pablo,

242

'we'd have to play the game
better and faster.'

243
00:16:47,844 --> 00:16:51,389
All right, Blackie's had a girlfriend
in Envigado for a while.

244
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:52,807
According to Centra Spike,

245
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:56,728
the last known intercept
places her somewhere in this vicinity.

246
00:16:56,853 --> 00:16:59,439
Yeah. And how's that relevant?

247
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:01,316
Intel says she's pregnant.

248
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:05,278
I know protocol is to vet intel,
wait for corroboration,

249
00:17:05,403 --> 00:17:07,697
but I feel this one in my gut, sir.

250
00:17:07,822 --> 00:17:09,699
Blackie's gonna show.

251
00:17:09,824 --> 00:17:12,077
Los Pepes keeps getting
the jump on us,

252

<i>sicarios</i> are gonna keep
winding up dead.

253
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,664
This way, we get to Blackie first,

254
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:18,416
bring that son of a bitch in
and get something out of him.

255
00:17:22,796 --> 00:17:28,176
Well, we could set up a perimeter.
No one walks in or out.

256
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:30,053
(Steve) Collapse that perimeter
house by house.

257
00:17:30,178 --> 00:17:32,597
- (Martinez) Yeah.
- (Steve) Sounds good to me.

Don'<i>t</i> fight with me anymore.

260
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:45,151
I'm going to tell you <i>two</i> things:
first, relax.

261
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:47,028
That's harmful for you and the baby.

262
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:50,699
Second, for the love of God,
take the money.

263
00:17:50,824 --> 00:17:51,825
I'll find more later.

264
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,328
It's not for you or me, it's for the baby,
please understand.

265
00:17:55,453 --> 00:17:57,998
Try to understand me.
I don'<i>t want</i> your money.

266
00:17:58,123 --> 00:18:00,292
I want you to be with me
and the baby, that's it.

267
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:04,754
Stop being stupid, girl.
We need that money.

268
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:07,007
- Listen to your dad.
- I don'<i>t</i> know what's wrong with this girl.

269
00:18:07,132 --> 00:18:09,092
(Blackie) She's stubborn.

270
00:18:09,217 --> 00:18:10,218
(Chatter in Spanish)

271
00:18:10,343 --> 00:18:11,678
- (In English) Hey!
- Hey.

272
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:12,971
What's going on?

273
00:18:13,096 --> 00:18:16,182
Martinez gave the green light
to go after Blackie.

274
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:20,687
- It's a good thing, right?
- Yeah. Right.

275
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:23,648
Goddamn Christmas miracle.

(In Spanish) Post three is in position.

(Man over radio) 'Yes, sir,
we'll be there in five minutes.'

278
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:00,060
(Berna) 'Wait, Javier.'

279
00:19:05,607 --> 00:19:08,026
(In English) We're moving in.
Let's go.

280
00:19:10,945 --> 00:19:12,614
(Phone ringing)

281
00:19:13,406 --> 00:19:17,410
(In Spanish) Talk to me.
We're just getting here.

282
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:19,204
Copy that, we're leaving now.

283
00:19:19,329 --> 00:19:21,748
It was Berna.
The streets are full of Search Bloc.

284
00:19:21,873 --> 00:19:25,335
All right, boys, the hunt is over for now.
Let's get out of here.

285
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:33,051
- What's going on?
- Nothing, sir.

286
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:36,429
We're conducting a police operation.
All good?

287
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:38,682
(Affirmative murmur)

288
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:40,308
Let him through.

289
00:19:43,853 --> 00:19:48,942
Keep calm, guys.
Hide your weapons while we handle this.

290
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:51,069
Let him through.

291
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:02,372
Good evening, what can I do for you?

292
00:20:02,497 --> 00:20:07,001
Good afternoon, gentleman.
I need to see some form of ID, please.

293
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:08,795
Of course, with pleasure.

294
00:20:11,923 --> 00:20:13,425
How's this for an ID?

295
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:26,688
Get out of the car and put your hands
where I can see them.

296
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:28,231
Quickly.

297
00:20:30,525 --> 00:20:31,776
Boy, come over here.

298
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:36,072
- Colonel. Situation at checkpoint 20.
- What's going on?

299
00:20:36,197 --> 00:20:38,366
- Armed men attempting to pass through.
- Checkpoint 20?

300
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:40,076
That's correct, sir.

301
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:44,789
- All units move to position 20.
- Understood.

302
00:20:44,914 --> 00:20:47,041
All units to position 20. Move!

303
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:50,545
- (In English) What's going on?
- Some shit's going down at checkpoint.

304
00:20:56,217 --> 00:20:58,636
(In Spanish) My love,
you have to take the money.

305
00:20:58,762 --> 00:21:01,890
Blackie! Blackie.
The cops are here.

306
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:04,934
Take care of the baby!
Take care, Carmelita!

307
00:21:05,852 --> 00:21:10,440
We're both on the same team here.
What's the problem?

308
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:15,236
Stay where you are!
Hands where I can see them.

309
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:19,949
Relax, relax.

310
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,787
Want to see my ID?

311
00:21:25,163 --> 00:21:27,916
- Take it out slowly.
- OK.

312
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,638
You point a gun at me, motherfucker?

313
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:43,681
Do me a favour.

314
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:47,519
Move those cars because we're
not playing cops and robbers here.

315
00:21:48,102 --> 00:21:50,188
(Steve in English)
What the fuck is this?

316
00:21:52,065 --> 00:21:53,066
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

317
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:56,319
(In Spanish) Relax! Relax!
Relax! Relax!

318
00:21:56,444 --> 00:21:58,696
Disarm. Disarm!

319
00:21:58,822 --> 00:22:01,032
- No, you disarm!
- Sir...

320
00:22:01,157 --> 00:22:04,536
(Carlos) Lower your firearm!

321
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:07,747
(In English) Put the fucking gun down!
(In Spanish) Easy! Easy!

322
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,500
(Javier clapping)
OK, tough guys. Bravo!

323
00:22:11,543 --> 00:22:13,253
Bravo!

324
00:22:13,837 --> 00:22:17,131
Bravo, yes, we know <i>it.</i>
We all want Escobar.

325
00:22:17,257 --> 00:22:19,259
But let us do the fucking job.

326
00:22:21,094 --> 00:22:24,222
(Softly) What? You want to
kill each other at a checkpoint?

327
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:27,892
Lower your weapon.
Lower it.

328
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:31,729
(Whispers) Lower it.

329
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,739
OK. These dreamers
think they're helping.

330
00:22:42,615 --> 00:22:45,285
- Are you OK? Yeah? Everything OK?
- Yes, sir.

331
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:49,038
OK. Let's go home alive.

332
00:22:49,163 --> 00:22:50,915
- OK?
- OK.

333
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,417
- Let them pass.
- OK.

334
00:22:55,253 --> 00:22:57,505
Well then, thank you.

335
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:08,641
(In English) Trying to avoid
a bloodbath, brother.

336
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,487
(In Spanish) What happened?
Everything OK? Yes?

337
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:22,906
Yes, sir.

338
00:23:23,031 --> 00:23:25,700
(Trujillo) Miss,
we need your cooperation.

339
00:23:25,825 --> 00:23:28,202
Tell us where Blackie is.
Where do we find him?

340
00:23:28,328 --> 00:23:29,996
I told you.
I haven't seen him.

341
00:23:30,121 --> 00:23:32,498
Don't be afraid.
We don't want you.

342
00:23:32,624 --> 00:23:35,209
We want your boyfriend, Blackie.

343
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:39,047
Sir, I told you,
I don'<i>t</i> know where he's <i>at.</i>

344
00:23:39,172 --> 00:23:41,382
That bastard has not come around
in a long time.

345
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:44,886
If you want, let's go to the station.
But I told you, I don't know where he is.

346
00:23:45,011 --> 00:23:47,180
So please leave my house.

347
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:50,391
They were eight, maybe ten.

348
00:23:52,143 --> 00:23:54,812
How did they take your firearm?

349
00:23:57,982 --> 00:24:02,320
- I don'<i>t</i> know, he just took <i>it.</i> Sorry.
- (Sighs)

350
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,326
Next time, might as well
put the gun to your own head.

351
00:24:08,451 --> 00:24:10,036
It's easier.

352
00:24:13,373 --> 00:24:14,457
(Sighs)

353
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:26,886
(In English) When were
you gonna tell me

354
00:24:27,011 --> 00:24:29,764
about your new friend
Carlos Castaño?

355
00:24:35,353 --> 00:24:39,816
He's not a friend, he's a...
he's a man with a shared interest.

356
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,235
Jesus Christ.
I hope you know what you're doing.

357
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,487
Don'<i>t</i> worry.
It's not gonna blow back on you.

358
00:24:44,612 --> 00:24:47,156
- No, it's not me I'm worried about.
- I can handle it.

359
00:24:47,281 --> 00:24:48,950
These aren'<i>t</i> the guys
you wanna be messing <i>with.</i>

360
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:58,042
They're gonna do what they're gonna do
with or without me, right?

361
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:03,172
At least this way...
I'm on the inside and I can control it.

362
00:25:04,382 --> 00:25:08,094
- Make sure it doesn'<i>t</i> go too far.
- So that doesn'<i>t</i> go too far?

363
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:10,304
The good guys, they got guns
pointing at their fucking head

364
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:14,267
- and the bad guys get away with it?
- Who are the good guys, Steve?

365
00:25:14,392 --> 00:25:15,893
That's us?

366
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:30,408
(In Spanish) Mr President,
these men, the Castaños,

367
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:34,037
I've seen their tactics firsthand
in the jungle against the FARC.

368
00:25:34,412 --> 00:25:39,125
'Their method of war is murder.
I think this is only the beginning.

369
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,711
'And it will get even worse.'

370
00:25:41,836 --> 00:25:44,547
'Colonel, I understand your concern.'

371
00:25:44,672 --> 00:25:48,259
It's strange. They usually operate
against the guerrillas

372
00:25:48,384 --> 00:25:51,929
but now they're operating
against the narcos.

373
00:25:52,055 --> 00:25:55,349
Hugo, my cabinet is still evaluating
the best course of action

374
00:25:55,475 --> 00:25:57,101
with regard to Los Pepes.

375
00:25:57,852 --> 00:26:03,566
Sir, I'd like your permission
to engage them.

376
00:26:03,691 --> 00:26:09,197
No. The greatest service we can do
for this nation is capture Escobar.

377
00:26:09,322 --> 00:26:11,324
That's what we must focus on, Colonel.

378
00:26:11,449 --> 00:26:13,534
'It's our priority.'

379
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:17,580
I understand. Thank you, sir.

380
00:26:24,003 --> 00:26:26,422
(Steve) 'Los Pepes may have
seemed to be running the board,

381
00:26:26,547 --> 00:26:28,883
'but Escobar still had a trick or two
up his sleeve.

382
00:26:29,008 --> 00:26:32,303
'Remember I told you Ricardo Prisco
was a licensed doctor?

383
00:26:32,845 --> 00:26:33,971
'Well, he was.

384
00:26:34,097 --> 00:26:38,518
'And as such, he had privileges
at just about every hospital in Medellín.

385
00:26:38,643 --> 00:26:42,563
'Including the one where the Los Pepes
gunman he shot was recovering.

386
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:46,734
'Unfortunately for that guy,
Dr Prisco paid him a visit.'

387
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:49,153
(In Spanish) Let's take a look
at this injury.

388
00:26:52,824 --> 00:26:55,743
Oh... very good.

389
00:26:57,703 --> 00:27:00,456
- (Muffled screams)
- Shh!

390
00:27:00,581 --> 00:27:02,291
(Whimpering)

391
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:06,921
This is going to hurt.
Tell me who you work for.

392
00:27:07,964 --> 00:27:09,841
(Pablo) The Castaños.

393
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:13,427
Mmm.

394
00:27:13,553 --> 00:27:15,054
The Castaños.

395
00:27:17,265 --> 00:27:21,269
What could have brought them
out of the jungle?

396
00:27:24,105 --> 00:27:26,274
I say it was money.

397
00:27:27,108 --> 00:27:30,153
More money
than Judy Moncada can find.

398
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:33,406
Pablo.

399
00:27:35,032 --> 00:27:37,952
Now is not the time
to take on more problems, brother.

400
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,168
The Cali cartel thinks
they're immune to <i>attack.</i>

401
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:47,962
This can't go unanswered.

402
00:27:49,005 --> 00:27:50,173
Go.

403
00:27:50,298 --> 00:27:52,967
(Men murmur in Spanish)

404
00:28:07,315 --> 00:28:08,816
Maria.

405
00:28:10,693 --> 00:28:12,820
(Whispers) Carlos, you scared me.

406
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:29,629
Tata, you have to do it now.
Pablo's gone mad.

407
00:28:29,754 --> 00:28:32,423
With everything he's planning,
there will be consequences.

408
00:28:32,548 --> 00:28:34,592
You and the kids
need to separate from him.

409
00:28:34,717 --> 00:28:36,719
No, Carlos.

410
00:28:40,014 --> 00:28:42,141
Tata, my God, listen to me.

411
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:45,144
There's a fearlessness to Los Pepes
that I've never seen.

412
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:48,231
The public declarations,
the open displays.

413
00:28:48,606 --> 00:28:50,858
They won'<i>t</i> stop until he's dead.

414
00:28:50,983 --> 00:28:54,654
I know that, Carlos.
I've known for a long time now.

415
00:28:55,738 --> 00:28:58,866
You know what's the only thought
on my mind?

416
00:28:58,991 --> 00:29:00,826
That this is the last time...

417
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:04,747
the last time
I'll look at my husband's face.

418
00:29:04,872 --> 00:29:08,042
The last time
I'll feel his arms around me.

419
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:11,504
The last time I'll see him play
with our children.

420
00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:15,174
I automatically push that idea
out of my mind.

421
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:16,884
And now? Hmm?

422
00:29:20,346 --> 00:29:23,391
Now I know, Carlos,
that wherever I <i>go...</i>

423
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,727
I'll always be Pablo Escobar's wife.

424
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:30,690
My children will always
be Pablo Escobar's children.

425
00:29:31,482 --> 00:29:34,235
Even if we lived in exile
with him.

426
00:29:35,695 --> 00:29:38,781
But without him? (Scoffs softly)

427
00:29:39,615 --> 00:29:40,700
No.

428
00:29:43,828 --> 00:29:46,414
OK. OK.

429
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:48,207
Let's do something.

430
00:29:48,332 --> 00:29:52,295
If we talk to him,
maybe he'll reconsider leaving with us.

431
00:29:54,964 --> 00:29:57,133
I've had a good life.

432
00:29:58,134 --> 00:30:01,304
Did you ever imagine
we'd have all this?

433
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:14,191
(Overlapping chatter slowly subsides)

434
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:22,199
When my niece was growing up,
she didn'<i>t</i> think this day would come.

435
00:30:22,325 --> 00:30:25,119
- (Low chuckles)
- She was so skinny.

436
00:30:25,244 --> 00:30:28,748
- She wore glasses and had braces.
- Yes.

437
00:30:28,873 --> 00:30:33,127
When she was 12,
she thought her life was over.

438
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,673
I told her to wait and be patient.

439
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:42,094
Someday her beauty on the outside
would match her beauty within.

440
00:30:42,762 --> 00:30:45,306
You have never looked more beautiful
than you do tonight.

441
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:47,558
(Murmurs of agreement in crowd)

442
00:30:47,683 --> 00:30:49,101
Cheers to the family.

443
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:52,938
To Marta and Diego! Cheers!

444
00:30:53,064 --> 00:30:56,150
- (Crowd) Cheers!
- (Applause)

445
00:30:57,443 --> 00:30:59,945
(♪ Up-tempo Latin music plays)

446
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,513
(Whispers indistinctly)

447
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:36,982
(Indistinct chatter)

448
00:31:43,572 --> 00:31:45,908
(Music continues nearby)

449

(Explosion, people screaming)

450
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:56,168
(Diego) Wait!

451
00:31:56,502 --> 00:31:58,587
Wait! Wait!

452

(Woman sobbing)

455
00:32:15,646 --> 00:32:20,401
Ma! Papa! Papa!

456
00:32:22,903 --> 00:32:26,157
- I'm here, my love.
- Mum! (sobs)

457
00:32:29,452 --> 00:32:32,288
(Sobbing continues)

458
00:32:38,711 --> 00:32:40,212
That man...

459
00:32:43,632 --> 00:32:46,802
has no decency.

460
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:55,019
To attack my family like this...

461
00:32:57,188 --> 00:32:59,190
my daughter...

462
00:33:00,232 --> 00:33:02,735
on the night of her wedding...

463
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:08,157
Only a madman would do <i>that.</i>

464
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:14,288
A crazed animal, dangerous.

465
00:33:18,459 --> 00:33:19,543
I want him dead.

466
00:33:20,503 --> 00:33:22,505
Not next year. Right now.

467
00:33:23,589 --> 00:33:25,216
Kill all of them.

468
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:29,929
I don'<i>t</i> just want you to kill his lawyers,
accountants and bankers...

469
00:33:30,054 --> 00:33:33,307
I want you to kill his secretaries...

470
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:39,021
anyone who lifted a finger
to help that man.

471
00:33:39,146 --> 00:33:41,398
I want to see them dead.

472
00:33:41,524 --> 00:33:44,527
Anyone who has ever licked
a postage stamp

473
00:33:44,652 --> 00:33:46,320
and put it on an envelope
in his name,

474
00:33:46,445 --> 00:33:48,447
I want to see them dead!

475
00:33:48,572 --> 00:33:54,912
And then I want you to find anyone who
ever shook his hand and kill them too!

476
00:33:57,498 --> 00:33:59,667
That son of a bitch.

477
00:34:03,546 --> 00:34:08,050
From this night, we'll show no mercy.

478
00:34:18,852 --> 00:34:20,062
(Pablo) 'Gilberto?'

479
00:34:20,187 --> 00:34:23,482
(La Quica) Gilberto, Miguel
and Pacho survived, boss.

480
00:34:23,607 --> 00:34:25,818
That'll be all, Quica.

481
00:34:25,943 --> 00:34:27,444
Thank you, boss.

482
00:34:36,078 --> 00:34:37,580
(Carlos) Pablo?

483
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,126
I'm worried about Tata.

484
00:34:43,502 --> 00:34:45,588
I think you should let her travel.
She'll be safer.

485
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:49,008
What you're doing
will have consequences.

486
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,511
That's why they're here. Right?

487
00:34:53,554 --> 00:34:55,889
That's why they're here with me,
to be safe.

488
00:34:56,348 --> 00:34:59,435
- Cali is going to want payback for...
- I know...

489
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,271
who my enemies are, Carlos.

490
00:35:04,315 --> 00:35:06,275
And I can fight them all.

491
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,319
I know <i>that.</i>

492
00:35:08,444 --> 00:35:10,779
But if Tata and the children
are out of the country,

493
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:13,032
you'd be free to wage this war
with no holds barred.

494
00:35:17,036 --> 00:35:19,038
Let me ask you something.

495
00:35:29,798 --> 00:35:31,342
- Why are you here?
- Pablo...

496
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:33,052
For Tata.

497
00:35:34,511 --> 00:35:35,929
Right?

498
00:35:38,432 --> 00:35:40,309
To make her happier.

499
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:46,815
To help her be more comfortable
with the life we're being forced to lead.

500
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,403
Have you done that?

501
00:35:52,863 --> 00:35:56,116
Pablo, my sister is terrified.
And you can't see <i>that...</i>

502
00:35:56,241 --> 00:36:02,373
Your sister is a lot tougher
than you think.

503
00:36:03,874 --> 00:36:08,671
My wife... and my children...

504
00:36:08,796 --> 00:36:10,964
stay with me.

505
00:36:21,558 --> 00:36:23,560
(Sighs)

506
00:36:28,357 --> 00:36:29,608
(In Spanish) Hello.

507
00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:31,860
(In English) Did you see this?

508
00:36:31,985 --> 00:36:34,738
Reports of a massive bombing
in Cali last night.

509
00:36:34,863 --> 00:36:36,115
Gilberto Rodríguez's
daughter's wedding?

510
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,324
(Chuckles)

511
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:38,867
I know of only one person
in Colombia

512
00:36:38,992 --> 00:36:41,245
with the balls big enough
to go after that guy.

513
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,122
Yeah, Pablo Escobar.

514
00:36:43,247 --> 00:36:44,832
He had to have had
a damn good reason.

515
00:36:45,374 --> 00:36:48,836
I'd like to shift some of our resources
from Medellín to Cali.

516
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,004
Now's a bad time
to deviate from Medellín.

517
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,549
Cali is trafficking
in the billions right now.

518
00:36:53,674 --> 00:36:56,009
- If they get a free head start...
- You're not wrong.

519
00:36:56,135 --> 00:36:58,429
But you're thinking
about this too logically.

520
00:36:59,805 --> 00:37:02,266
The best thing for you right now
is to keep your head in the game.

521
00:37:02,391 --> 00:37:06,895
Because right now,
the game is Pablo Escobar.

522
00:37:08,647 --> 00:37:11,650
Right. Escobar.

523
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:14,486
I'll see you at the party tonight.

524
00:37:15,863 --> 00:37:18,991
We could all use a few hours break
from this shit.

525
00:37:20,617 --> 00:37:22,119
I'll see you there.

526
00:37:32,588 --> 00:37:34,089
Manuel.

527
00:37:35,966 --> 00:37:37,634
(In Spanish) Ma'am?

528
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,262
Take me to Mass.

529
00:37:40,971 --> 00:37:44,808
- But the boss said we couldn'<i>t.</i>
- Pablo worries too much.

530
00:37:44,933 --> 00:37:47,269
Besides, you work for me.

531
00:37:50,939 --> 00:37:56,987
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

532
00:37:57,112 --> 00:38:03,952
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth, as it is in heaven.

533
00:38:04,077 --> 00:38:09,416
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

534
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:13,462
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

535
00:38:13,587 --> 00:38:17,090
(♪ Festive Latin music plays)

536
00:38:18,675 --> 00:38:21,011
(Man in English)
Welcome, Mr President.

537
00:38:22,888 --> 00:38:24,807
Welcome, Ma'am.

538
00:38:25,891 --> 00:38:29,895
Yeah, Bogotá is beautiful. It's a lot more
like an American city than I thought.

539
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,396
I didn'<i>t</i> know it'd be so cold.

540
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:33,524
- Good to see you.
- Thank you.

541
00:38:35,234 --> 00:38:41,698
(In Spanish) It's shameful for the country
to stand by while a group of mercenaries

542
00:38:41,824 --> 00:38:46,328
distributes its version
of perverse justice.

543
00:38:47,037 --> 00:38:49,164
It makes all of us look bad.

544
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:53,377
- Including the president.
- Especially the president.

545
00:38:53,502 --> 00:38:57,798
If he continues to allow Los Pepes
to do the dirty work,

546
00:38:57,923 --> 00:39:00,008
which is his responsibility...

547
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:06,056
Colombia will never forgive him.

548
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:09,852
(Church bells tolling)

549
00:39:09,977 --> 00:39:12,229
(Murmurs indistinctly)

550
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,283
MERRY CHRISTMAS

551
00:39:28,537 --> 00:39:30,539
(Engine starts)

552
00:39:35,294 --> 00:39:37,296
(Engine starts)

553
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,595
(Overlapping chatter)

554
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,472
(In English) Mr President.

555
00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:53,228
Lovely party, Ambassador.

556
00:39:53,353 --> 00:39:57,566
It's nice we can pretend
we're all friends.

557
00:39:57,691 --> 00:40:01,737
Believe it or not, the State Department
does the guest list, not me.

558
00:40:01,862 --> 00:40:05,616
I can'<i>t wait to</i> tell them
that he wants us to legalise drugs.

559
00:40:08,535 --> 00:40:11,121
He thinks I should
publicly condemn Los Pepes.

560
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:15,417
They're criminals.
Their activities cannot be condoned.

561
00:40:16,335 --> 00:40:20,005
Even if one does approve of the results.

562
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:25,135
(Sighs) Mr President,
I'm not one to bullshit.

563
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,554
Maybe that's hurt me in my career.

564
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:31,058
Yes, Los Pepes are an ugly business.

565
00:40:34,019 --> 00:40:36,313
They're getting to Escobar.

566
00:40:36,438 --> 00:40:38,482
That's all that matters at the present.

567
00:40:41,068 --> 00:40:45,447
If I condemn them,
I have to police them.

568
00:40:45,572 --> 00:40:51,495
With politics and war...
the trick is in the timing.

569
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:56,792
Watch how they evolve,
how their actions are received.

570
00:40:56,917 --> 00:41:01,964
And, uh, up till then,
pretend they don't exist.

571
00:41:03,048 --> 00:41:05,342
Well, we can if you can.

572

(♪ Singing "Silent Night" in Spanish)

What are you up to in here?
Have a drink.

574
00:41:27,114 --> 00:41:29,992
Thanks.
Saved me a trip to the bar.

575
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:32,953
Call it inter-agency cooperation.

576
00:41:33,078 --> 00:41:38,166
Hmm. That's a joke.
And it's funny.

577
00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:43,171
Cheers.
So where are you from, Bill?

578
00:41:43,296 --> 00:41:45,507
Originally, Oregon.

579
00:41:47,009 --> 00:41:48,510
You were in Afghanistan, right?

580
00:41:49,761 --> 00:41:52,347
Well, I could tell you that
but then I'd have <i>to...</i>

581
00:41:53,515 --> 00:41:55,017
Funny.

582
00:41:57,477 --> 00:42:01,565
I know Bill Haler.
He was our guy in Afghanistan.

583
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:05,777
Oh, yeah.
DEA Bill, we used to call him.

584
00:42:05,902 --> 00:42:08,822
I liked him.
Stayed in his lane.

585
00:42:12,325 --> 00:42:14,077
So, as I'm sure you know,

586
00:42:14,202 --> 00:42:18,540
I recently asked for a resource redirect
into some emerging players

587
00:42:18,665 --> 00:42:20,083
in the trafficking world.

588
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:22,794
- A group based in Cali. Ring a bell?
- (Sighs)

589
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:24,755
We're not gonna talk
about work, are we?

590
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,381
My request was denied, Bill.

591
00:42:26,506 --> 00:42:28,216
We were just
getting to know each other.

592
00:42:28,341 --> 00:42:30,552
So I spoke to DEA Bill.

593
00:42:30,677 --> 00:42:32,429
- He's in Washington now.
- You don't say.

594
00:42:32,554 --> 00:42:36,767
And he told me the roadblock
was caused by the agency.

595
00:42:37,601 --> 00:42:39,936
Something about an ongoing operation.

596
00:42:40,062 --> 00:42:44,357
He actually said,
"That sounds like CIA Bill."

597
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:50,072
Look, I don'<i>t</i> care what you do
with the commies and the paramilitaries.

598
00:42:50,197 --> 00:42:57,079
But as soon as your ongoing operations
involve narcos... you're in my backyard.

(In Spanish) Where were you?

601
00:43:24,272 --> 00:43:26,858
- I went to church.
- I told you it wasn'<i>t</i> safe.

602
00:43:26,983 --> 00:43:30,362
And I told you that it would be fine.
And look, everything's fine.

603
00:43:30,487 --> 00:43:32,697
How could you put
the children's lives at risk?

604
00:43:32,823 --> 00:43:34,950
No one here is in danger.

605
00:43:35,075 --> 00:43:39,204
I'm surprised at you, Pablo. This one
has always been nervous, but you?

Don'<i>t</i> talk that way to my husband.

622
00:44:29,379 --> 00:44:31,631
Carlos, let's go!

623
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,384
Run, Limón, run!

624
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:36,595
Let's go! Outside!

625
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,223
- Come on, Tata, come on.
- Get him in the car. Get him inside!

626
00:44:40,348 --> 00:44:43,560
- Quickly! Let's go!
- Quickly!

627
00:44:43,685 --> 00:44:45,103
Give me the girl.

628
00:44:45,228 --> 00:44:47,856
- Get in, Tata, get in.
- (Overlapping shouts)

629
00:44:47,981 --> 00:44:50,150
Come on, brother. Go!
Cover that side!

630
00:44:50,275 --> 00:44:51,776
Move!

631
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:54,696

(Indistinct shouts in Spanish)

637
00:45:55,757 --> 00:45:57,842
They're in the house!
Let's go! Let's go!

638
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:03,306
- Calm down.
- Don'<i>t</i> let her move.

639
00:46:03,431 --> 00:46:04,432
Carlos!

640
00:46:04,557 --> 00:46:05,976
Come on, boss! Let's go.

641
00:46:06,101 --> 00:46:07,519
- (Tata) Pablo!
- Carlos!

642
00:46:07,644 --> 00:46:09,521
(Grunts)

(Sobbing)

650
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,171
No!

651
00:47:29,768 --> 00:47:31,770
Los Pepes...

652
00:47:34,272 --> 00:47:36,775
the Cali cartel, Judy Moncada,

653
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,653
the Castaños, the government,
the gringos.

654
00:47:40,779 --> 00:47:43,615
Let the bastards come.

655
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:47,952
We'll be ready for a war,
a fucking bloodbath.

656
00:47:48,078 --> 00:47:52,832
We will fight like we have never
fought before in our lives.

657
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:55,752
Yes, boss.

658
00:47:55,877 --> 00:47:59,464
Go for food
and you go for firewood.

659
00:48:02,884 --> 00:48:07,305
(Softly) Whoever did this
will never get near us ever again.

660
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,062
I promise you.

661
00:48:21,027 --> 00:48:25,407
Daddy, how will Santa
know how to find us?

662
00:48:30,453 --> 00:48:32,622
(Voice trembling)

663
00:48:36,501 --> 00:48:38,336
(Softly) Santa...

664
00:48:40,713 --> 00:48:47,137
Santa will always find
your good and kind heart.

665
00:48:48,847 --> 00:48:51,474
Wherever you are in this world.

666
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:57,439
Boss? The wood is all <i>wet.</i>
There's no way to light it up.

667
00:49:07,365 --> 00:49:10,160
Go to Envigado for wood and food.

668
00:49:10,618 --> 00:49:13,788
- Right away, boss.
- Be careful not to be seen.

669
00:49:13,913 --> 00:49:15,582
Got <i>it.</i>

670
00:49:19,752 --> 00:49:22,088
This is all I could find, boss.

671
00:49:22,964 --> 00:49:24,382
How do you open that shit?

672
00:49:24,924 --> 00:49:26,509
I'll go look, boss.

673
00:49:43,526 --> 00:49:45,278
(In Spanish) This just came in.

674
00:49:50,116 --> 00:49:52,535
Shit's getting real, Peña.

675
00:50:11,846 --> 00:50:15,266
(Sirens wailing in distance)

676
00:50:46,047 --> 00:50:50,301
- (Tata sniffling)
- Mummy, I'm cold.

677
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:54,514
She's freezing.

678
00:51:00,853 --> 00:51:02,355
Put this on.

679
00:51:37,348 --> 00:51:42,020
You and the children...
need to leave Colombia.

680
00:51:44,981 --> 00:51:50,987
When you're safe,
I'll be free to do what's best for us.

681
00:51:59,996 --> 00:52:02,248
(Softly) It won'<i>t</i> be long.

682
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:08,546
Soon we'll be together again.

683
00:52:12,842 --> 00:52:14,344
Forever.

684
00:52:20,266 --> 00:52:21,934
(Sniffling)

685
00:52:24,771 --> 00:52:28,941
(♪ Slow Latin guitar song plays)
