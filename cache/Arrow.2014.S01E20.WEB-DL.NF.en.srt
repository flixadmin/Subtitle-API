I want us to get back on the same page.

Oliver, we're not even in the same book,
you and me, not anymore.

457
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:16,229
I just did what I thought I had to.

458
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,400
Just like I'm doing what I have to.

Don't do this.

The only thing you have to stop me
from going out that door is an arrow.

Hey.

Where's he going?

00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,023
So how did our Robin Hood do?
As expected?

466
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,609
So back to the drawing board we go.

How did you escape?

00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,840
I didn't.
