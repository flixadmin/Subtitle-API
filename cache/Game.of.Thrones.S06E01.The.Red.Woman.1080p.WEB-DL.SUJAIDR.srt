00:03:27,235 --> 00:03:29,369
<i>It's coming from the courtyard.</i>

3
00:03:34,543 --> 00:03:36,876
It's the Lord Commander!

4
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:51,925
Help me get him inside.

5
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:49,149
Thorne did this.

6
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:56,623
How many of your brothers
do you think you can trust?

7
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,324
Trust?

8
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:02,796
The men in this room.

9
00:05:04,132 --> 00:05:06,750
Does the wolf know you?

10
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:08,835
We need all the help we can get.

11
00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:17,177
<i>Ser Davos.</i>

12
00:05:58,687 --> 00:06:02,055
<i>I saw him in the flames</i>

13
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,307
fighting at Winterfell.

14
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:10,480
I can't speak for the flames...

15
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,200
but he's gone.

16
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:36,089
<i>He was our Lord Commander.</i>

17
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:38,007
<i>He never should have been!</i>

18
00:06:41,646 --> 00:06:43,686
You all know why you're here.

19
00:06:46,935 --> 00:06:49,485
Jon Snow is dead.

20
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:50,770
Who killed him?

21
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:53,740
I did.

22
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:56,109
And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck

23
00:06:56,194 --> 00:06:58,494
and the other officers
in this castle.

24
00:06:58,613 --> 00:07:00,280
- Murderers!
- Traitors!

25
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:06,336
You're right!

26
00:07:06,454 --> 00:07:08,671
<i>We've committed treason, all of us.</i>

27
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,875
Jon Snow was my Lord Commander.

28
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:14,677
I had no love for him.

29
00:07:14,796 --> 00:07:17,130
That was no secret.

30
00:07:17,265 --> 00:07:21,467
But I never once disobeyed an order.

31
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:23,970
Loyalty is the foundation

32
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:26,105
on which the Night's Watch is built.

33
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:28,558
And the Watch means everything to me.

34
00:07:28,643 --> 00:07:30,610
I have given my life,

35
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:34,814
we have all given our lives
to the Night's Watch.

36
00:07:37,202 --> 00:07:41,704
Jon Snow was going to
destroy the Night's Watch.

37
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,407
<i>He let the wildlings
through our gates</i>

38
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:47,961
as no Lord Commander
has ever done before.

39
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:52,832
He gave them the very land
on which they reaved

40
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:56,669
and raped and murdered.

41
00:07:56,805 --> 00:08:01,007
Lord Commander Snow did
what he thought was right,

42
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:04,010
I've no doubt about that.

43
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:08,314
And what he thought was right
would have been the end of us.

44
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,601
He thrust a terrible choice upon us.

45
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:14,854
And we made it.

46
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:28,868
<i>He'll have
seen we didn't come.</i>

47
00:08:28,954 --> 00:08:31,037
Thorne will have
made it official by now.

48
00:08:31,172 --> 00:08:32,622
Castle Black is his.

49
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:35,875
I don't care who's sitting
at the high table.

50
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:37,543
Jon was my friend.

51
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,847
And those fuckers butchered him.

52
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:43,383
Now we return the favor.

53
00:08:43,468 --> 00:08:44,884
We don't have the numbers.

54
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,936
- We have a direwolf.
- It's not enough.

55
00:08:47,055 --> 00:08:49,055
<i>I didn't know Lord
Commander Snow for long,</i>

56
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,358
but I have to believe he wouldn't have
wanted his friends to die for nothing.

57
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:56,946
If you were planning to see tomorrow,
you picked the wrong room.

58
00:08:57,065 --> 00:08:59,232
We all die today.

59
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:02,035
I say we do our best to take
Thorne with us when we go.

60
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,538
We need to fight,
but we don't need to die.

61
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:08,041
- Not if we have help.
- Who is gonna help us?

62
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:11,494
You're not the only ones who
owe your lives to Jon Snow.

63
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:21,421
Bolt the door.

64
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:23,423
Don't let anyone in.

65
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:25,591
I'll be back as soon as I can.

66
00:09:35,603 --> 00:09:38,855
<i>She was 11 the
first time I saw her.</i>

67
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:43,609
The kennelmaster's daughter.

68
00:09:45,914 --> 00:09:48,031
She smelled of dog.

69
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:54,954
I wasn't much older, but everybody
was already afraid of me.

70
00:09:56,591 --> 00:09:58,624
You certainly were.

71
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:05,631
Myranda wasn't, though.

72
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:09,602
What could I do to her
that those hounds couldn't?

73
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:11,554
She was fearless.

74
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,307
There was nothing she wouldn't do.

75
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:23,816
Your pain will be paid for
a thousand times over.

76
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:29,489
I wish you could be here to watch.

77
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:37,413
<i>Shall I have a
grave dug for her, my lord?</i>

78
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,918
<i>Or would you rather
the men build a pyre?</i>

79
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:49,058
Buried, burned?

80
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:50,810
This is good meat.

81
00:10:50,895 --> 00:10:52,345
Feed it to the hounds.

82
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:57,066
Your command of the
cavalry was impressive.

83
00:10:57,185 --> 00:11:00,069
Thanks to you, the false king
Stannis Baratheon is dead.

84
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:02,822
Do you know who struck
the killing blow?

85
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:04,907
- No.
- A shame.

86
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:06,909
I'd reward the man.

87
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:10,329
Still, a great victory.

88
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:12,448
Do you feel like a victor?

89
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:19,422
I rebelled against the crown

90
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,591
to arrange your marriage
to Sansa Stark.

91
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:24,210
Do you think that
burning wagons in the night

92
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:26,546
and mowing down tired,
outnumbered Baratheons

93
00:11:26,681 --> 00:11:29,966
is the same as facing a prepared
and provisioned Lannister army?

94
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:34,470
No.

95
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:38,057
A reckoning will come.

96
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:39,775
We need the North to face it.

97
00:11:39,894 --> 00:11:41,727
The entire North.

98
00:11:41,863 --> 00:11:45,064
They won't back us
without Sansa Stark.

99
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:48,818
We no longer have Sansa Stark.

100
00:11:48,903 --> 00:11:51,120
You played your games with her.

101
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:54,740
You played your games with the heir to the
Iron Islands and now they're both gone.

102
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:57,743
I have a team of men after them
with some of my best hounds.

103
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:59,378
<i>They won't get far.</i>

104
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:01,464
I'm glad to hear it.

105
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,884
Without Sansa, you won't be
able to produce an heir.

106
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:08,054
And without an heir, well...

107
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:13,226
let's hope the maesters are right

108
00:12:13,311 --> 00:12:15,228
and Lady Walda's carrying a boy.

109
00:12:35,617 --> 00:12:37,583
We can't stop.

110
00:12:56,304 --> 00:12:57,803
We have to cross here.

111
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:03,392
- I can't.
- It's the only way to throw off the hounds.

112
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:06,028
But it's too cold. I can't.
I won't make it. I'll die.

113
00:13:06,147 --> 00:13:08,648
I've seen what his hounds
do to a person.

114
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:10,733
This way is better.

115
00:13:42,934 --> 00:13:45,351
Over here.
Come on.

116
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:02,118
Sansa.

117
00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:05,171
Sansa.

118
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,361
<i>Tell them to settle down!</i>

119
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:29,695
Stay here.
I'll lure them away.

120
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:31,897
No, I won't make it without you.

121
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:33,733
You will.

122
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:36,068
Go north, only north.

123
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:37,987
Jon is Lord Commander
at Castle Black.

124
00:14:38,072 --> 00:14:39,739
He'll help you.

125
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,467
See somebody, eh?

126
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:54,086
- There they are!
- Get them!

127
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:00,092
Where is Lady Bolton?

128
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:03,095
- Dead.
- Liar.

129
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:06,432
<i>She broke her leg
jumping from the ramparts.</i>

130
00:15:06,517 --> 00:15:08,601
I left her to die in the snow.

131
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:15,574
Got something!
Run!

132
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,195
<i>Hyah!</i>

133
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:30,039
Resist. Stay.

134
00:15:32,126 --> 00:15:34,126
<i> Stay.</i>

135
00:15:34,262 --> 00:15:38,464
I can't wait to see what parts
Ramsay cuts off you this time.

136
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:49,141
<i>Rider! Who is it?</i>

137
00:15:49,227 --> 00:15:51,777
It's a bloody woman.

138
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:01,380
No! Please!

139
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:57,520
Lady Sansa, I offer
my services once again.

140
00:17:59,106 --> 00:18:01,273
I will shield your back
and keep your counsel

141
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,609
and give my life
for yours if need be.

142
00:18:05,112 --> 00:18:07,279
I swear it by the old
gods and the new.

143
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,091
And I vow...

144
00:18:20,878 --> 00:18:24,296
that you shall always
have a place by my hearth

145
00:18:24,432 --> 00:18:26,265
<i>and...</i>

146
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:30,219
Meat and mead at my table.

147
00:18:30,304 --> 00:18:32,471
...meat and mead
at my table.

148
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:39,562
And I pledge to ask no service of you

149
00:18:39,647 --> 00:18:42,147
that might bring you dishonor.

150
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:45,484
<i>I swear it by the old
gods and the new.</i>

151
00:18:46,871 --> 00:18:48,571
Arise.

152
00:19:33,701 --> 00:19:37,169
<i>Your Grace,
I'm sorry to disturb you.</i>

153
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:39,838
A ship from Dorne
has sailed into the harbor.

154
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:42,958
Myrcella.

155
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:58,951
Do you remember the first
time you saw a dead body?

156
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:01,954
Mother.

157
00:21:04,258 --> 00:21:05,958
All I could think about when she died

158
00:21:06,093 --> 00:21:08,260
was what would happen to her now.

159
00:21:11,882 --> 00:21:14,883
Every day, every night,

160
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:17,302
what does Mama look like now?

161
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,940
Has she started to bloat?

162
00:21:23,477 --> 00:21:25,978
Has her skin turned black?

163
00:21:27,481 --> 00:21:30,149
Have her lips peeled
back from her teeth?

164
00:21:35,122 --> 00:21:37,990
I think about locking
Myrcella in a crypt.

165
00:21:39,827 --> 00:21:42,377
I think about her beautiful
little face starting to collapse.

166
00:21:42,496 --> 00:21:45,664
Shh, shh.
Don't think about it.

167
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,466
I have to.

168
00:21:49,503 --> 00:21:51,637
I have to. It's not right
she has to suffer alone.

169
00:21:51,722 --> 00:21:54,973
She's not suffering.
She's gone.

170
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:57,926
No one can hurt her anymore.

171
00:21:59,513 --> 00:22:01,313
She was good.

172
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,601
From her first breath,
she was so sweet.

173
00:22:07,354 --> 00:22:09,354
I don't know where she came from.

174
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:14,359
She was nothing like me.

175
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:16,912
No meanness, no jealousy, just good.

176
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:18,697
I know.

177
00:22:18,783 --> 00:22:23,035
<i>I thought if I could
make something so good,</i>

178
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,704
so pure...

179
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:31,043
- maybe I'm not a monster.
- <i>Listen-- listen to me.</i>

180
00:22:31,128 --> 00:22:33,679
She was my daughter and I failed her.

181
00:22:33,764 --> 00:22:36,265
No, I knew this would happen.

182
00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:38,517
The witch told me years ago.

183
00:22:40,437 --> 00:22:43,555
She promised me three children
and she promised me they'd die.

184
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:46,225
"And gold their shrouds."

185
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,893
Everything she said came true.

186
00:22:47,978 --> 00:22:49,728
You couldn't have stopped it.

187
00:22:49,864 --> 00:22:51,480
It's prophecy.
It's fate.

188
00:22:51,565 --> 00:22:54,566
- You don't believe that.
- Of course I do.

189
00:22:54,652 --> 00:22:57,820
You told me yourself
when Father died.

190
00:22:57,905 --> 00:22:59,788
You said we had to stay together.

191
00:22:59,907 --> 00:23:03,125
You said people would try to
tear us apart, take what's ours.

192
00:23:03,244 --> 00:23:04,743
That was a prophecy, too.

193
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:07,129
I didn't listen to you and
everything you said came true.

194
00:23:07,248 --> 00:23:09,665
Fuck prophecy.
Fuck fate.

195
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,134
Fuck everyone who isn't us.

196
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:13,752
We're the only ones who matter,

197
00:23:13,888 --> 00:23:15,971
the only ones in this world.

198
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,530
And everything they've taken from us,

199
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:19,675
we're going to take back and more.

200
00:23:22,263 --> 00:23:24,930
We're going to take
everything there is.

201
00:23:32,072 --> 00:23:35,908
"The Seven Hells brim
with the souls of saintly men.

202
00:23:35,993 --> 00:23:38,827
They scream in agony
and their shame is so great,

203
00:23:38,946 --> 00:23:40,913
they do not feel the flames,

204
00:23:40,998 --> 00:23:43,916
for now they see
if not for a single sin

205
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:46,752
they concealed,
they were saved."

206
00:23:46,837 --> 00:23:48,754
I'd like to see my brother.

207
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:51,123
- Confess.
- Please.

208
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,208
How is he?
At least tell me that.

209
00:23:53,294 --> 00:23:54,626
Confess.

210
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:00,799
I am the queen and I
demand to see my brother.

211
00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:02,885
<i>Sinners don't make demands.</i>

212
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,687
They make confessions.

213
00:24:08,475 --> 00:24:11,443
Septa Unella.

214
00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:14,396
Our other guests need you.

215
00:24:25,576 --> 00:24:27,659
There.

216
00:24:29,246 --> 00:24:32,497
Septa Unella can be
overzealous at times.

217
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:33,999
I'll speak with her.

218
00:24:35,636 --> 00:24:38,804
My brother, can you
tell me how he is?

219
00:24:40,557 --> 00:24:44,509
It isn't Ser Loras
that brings me here.

220
00:24:45,846 --> 00:24:47,679
Your husband misses you dearly.

221
00:24:47,815 --> 00:24:51,817
The love between a man
and wife is sacred.

222
00:24:51,902 --> 00:24:55,070
It reflects the love
the gods have for all of us.

223
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:59,658
But sin leads us away
from the sacred.

224
00:24:59,743 --> 00:25:02,577
And only confession can purge sin.

225
00:25:02,696 --> 00:25:05,364
I have nothing to confess.

226
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:10,085
So you believe you are pure?

227
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:12,037
Perfect?

228
00:25:12,122 --> 00:25:14,506
Wholly without sin?

229
00:25:15,843 --> 00:25:17,209
None of us are.

230
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:21,964
You have started down the path.

231
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:25,550
But you have many miles to go.

232
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:42,150
I always envied Oberyn.

233
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:43,952
He lived.

234
00:25:44,071 --> 00:25:45,654
He truly lived.

235
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:47,572
Sailed around the world.

236
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,574
Fought men from every country.

237
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,077
Lay with the most
beautiful women alive.

238
00:25:52,212 --> 00:25:54,246
- And men.
- And men.

239
00:25:54,331 --> 00:25:56,915
He experienced everything

240
00:25:57,051 --> 00:25:59,918
while I sat here in Dorne

241
00:26:00,004 --> 00:26:04,923
trying my best to keep my
people alive and well fed.

242
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:06,758
But that is life.

243
00:26:08,345 --> 00:26:10,479
We each have our roles.

244
00:26:10,597 --> 00:26:15,350
Oberyn was born to be an adventurer.

245
00:26:15,436 --> 00:26:17,319
And I was born to rule.

246
00:26:17,438 --> 00:26:19,187
The gods are not fools.

247
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:22,157
You would have been
a lousy adventurer.

248
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:24,743
And Oberyn, pfft,

249
00:26:24,828 --> 00:26:26,528
he would have been a terrible ruler.

250
00:26:26,613 --> 00:26:29,998
Your mother is a brilliant
woman, you know that?

251
00:26:30,117 --> 00:26:32,417
<i>Prince Doran.</i>

252
00:26:44,298 --> 00:26:46,264
The Princess Myrcella.

253
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:07,402
When was the last time
you left this palace?

254
00:27:07,488 --> 00:27:09,821
You don't know your own people.

255
00:27:09,957 --> 00:27:13,158
<i>Their disgust for you.</i>

256
00:27:13,293 --> 00:27:17,162
Elia Martell raped and
murdered, and you did nothing.

257
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:21,833
Oberyn Martell butchered,
and you did nothing.

258
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,637
You're not a Dornishman.

259
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:28,974
You're not our prince.

260
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:33,345
My son Trystane...

261
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:38,416
Your son is weak just like you.

262
00:27:38,502 --> 00:27:42,587
And weak men will never
rule Dorne again.

263
00:28:05,362 --> 00:28:07,863
I told you I'm not hungry.

264
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:10,115
We're not here to feed you.

265
00:28:12,236 --> 00:28:14,319
We're here to kill you.

266
00:28:14,454 --> 00:28:17,122
You want her to do it or me?

267
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:20,826
We are family.
I don't want to hurt you.

268
00:28:20,961 --> 00:28:23,662
Her or me?

269
00:28:28,168 --> 00:28:29,251
You.

270
00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:31,219
Good.

271
00:28:31,338 --> 00:28:33,672
Smart boy.

272
00:28:50,357 --> 00:28:52,858
You're a greedy bitch, you know that?

273
00:29:00,334 --> 00:29:03,335
We're never going to fix
what's wrong with this city

274
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,954
from the top
of an 800-foot pyramid.

275
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:08,456
We'll be fine.

276
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:11,042
We're dressed like common merchants.

277
00:29:12,629 --> 00:29:14,963
You walk like a rich person.

278
00:29:15,048 --> 00:29:18,016
You've spent a lot of time
studying the way rich people walk?

279
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:22,103
You walk as though the paving
stones were your personal property.

280
00:29:22,222 --> 00:29:25,390
I used to steal from people
like you when I was a boy.

281
00:29:25,475 --> 00:29:27,525
It's a good thing
you're not a boy anymore.

282
00:29:29,196 --> 00:29:31,229
Because you have no cock.

283
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:44,772
_

284
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:47,757
_

285
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:52,083
She thinks you want to eat her baby.

286
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:54,920
_

287
00:29:55,408 --> 00:29:57,898
_

288
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,867
_

289
00:30:14,942 --> 00:30:18,443
- Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.
<i>- I know what mhysa means.</i>

290
00:30:18,528 --> 00:30:20,412
- Who wrote it?
- Hard to know.

291
00:30:20,497 --> 00:30:24,032
Our queen is not as popular
in Meereen as she used to be.

292
00:30:24,117 --> 00:30:25,867
The Sons of the Harpy?

293
00:30:25,953 --> 00:30:27,535
Very possibly.

294
00:30:29,373 --> 00:30:32,340
Daenerys Targaryen took away
their most valuable property,

295
00:30:32,459 --> 00:30:36,378
told them human beings weren't
even property to begin with.

296
00:30:36,463 --> 00:30:38,630
You can see why they're unhappy.

297
00:30:38,765 --> 00:30:41,016
Of course,

298
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:43,802
it could also be the freed men.

299
00:30:43,937 --> 00:30:47,305
_

300
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:51,643
_

301
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:54,847
_

302
00:30:55,115 --> 00:30:58,700
Many of the former slaves feel
that Daenerys has abandoned them.

303
00:30:59,396 --> 00:31:02,053
She did fly away on a
dragon and not come back.

304
00:31:02,574 --> 00:31:04,540
_

305
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:10,439
_

306
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,307
_

307
00:31:14,427 --> 00:31:19,169
_

308
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:21,707
It's a problem.

309
00:31:23,677 --> 00:31:26,378
Fear has brought Meereen
to a standstill.

310
00:31:28,382 --> 00:31:30,599
Whoever you are, wherever you go,

311
00:31:30,718 --> 00:31:33,885
someone in this city
wants to murder you.

312
00:31:33,971 --> 00:31:36,972
We can't fight
an enemy we don't know.

313
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:40,489
The Sons of the Harpy
planned their attack

314
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:42,441
in the fighting pits very carefully,

315
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:45,194
which means they take
orders from someone.

316
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,413
And have you started
looking for that someone?

317
00:31:47,498 --> 00:31:50,283
My little birds
have already taken wing.

318
00:31:50,418 --> 00:31:54,870
Soon they'll return, singing
songs of men in gold masks.

319
00:32:28,956 --> 00:32:33,743
Well, we won't be sailing
to Westeros anytime soon.

320
00:32:55,483 --> 00:32:57,366
Goat?

321
00:32:57,485 --> 00:32:59,068
Ram.

322
00:32:59,154 --> 00:33:00,820
You think our friend got him?

323
00:33:02,457 --> 00:33:05,241
Don't know anything else
that can melt a ram's horn.

324
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:09,495
We're on the right path, then.

325
00:33:09,631 --> 00:33:12,715
Perhaps she's
tired of being queen.

326
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:14,884
I don't think she likes it very much.

327
00:33:15,003 --> 00:33:17,170
She's too smart to like it.

328
00:33:17,305 --> 00:33:19,088
Maybe she's flown somewhere else,

329
00:33:19,174 --> 00:33:21,174
somewhere far away from men like us.

330
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:24,093
I've been all over the world.

331
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:26,095
There's no escaping men like us.

332
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:28,898
There's no escaping her, eh?

333
00:33:29,017 --> 00:33:32,185
You keep coming back.
Why?

334
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,769
You know why.

335
00:33:35,823 --> 00:33:37,857
Isn't it frustrating

336
00:33:37,992 --> 00:33:41,360
wanting someone
who doesn't want you back?

337
00:33:41,496 --> 00:33:42,912
Of course it is.

338
00:33:43,031 --> 00:33:45,581
You're a romantic.
I admire that.

339
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,667
Sometimes I look at you and I think,

340
00:33:47,752 --> 00:33:50,086
"So that's what I'll be like
when I grow old."

341
00:33:50,205 --> 00:33:51,871
If you grow old.

342
00:33:51,956 --> 00:33:53,206
If I grow old.

343
00:33:53,341 --> 00:33:55,508
I hope I do.

344
00:33:55,593 --> 00:33:57,343
I want to see what
the world looks like

345
00:33:57,428 --> 00:33:59,045
when she's done conquering it.

346
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,180
So do I.

347
00:34:20,868 --> 00:34:23,653
Huh, an army?

348
00:34:23,738 --> 00:34:25,154
Not an army.

349
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,989
A horde.

350
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,849
Dothraki?

351
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:18,958
They have her.

352
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,177

No.

<i>But there has to be a
price to pay for everything.</i>

420
00:41:53,104 --> 00:41:56,722
<i>I know, but have you
tried telling him that?</i>

421
00:42:04,081 --> 00:42:06,615
Thank you.

422
00:42:06,701 --> 00:42:09,251
Who'd go there after what
happened to that Kingsguard?

423
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,036
<i>- Probably had it coming.</i>
<i>- Maybe so,</i>

424
00:42:11,172 --> 00:42:12,755
<i>but I'm not risking it.</i>

425
00:42:12,873 --> 00:42:14,456
<i>- Just can't do it.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

426
00:42:14,542 --> 00:42:16,959
<i>Honesty as well. He gets it.</i>

427
00:42:21,515 --> 00:42:23,549
<i>Are you listening, blind girl?</i>

428
00:42:25,269 --> 00:42:27,886
Do you hear them talking?

429
00:42:27,972 --> 00:42:30,689
<i>Do any of them talk to you?</i>

430
00:42:30,775 --> 00:42:32,191
<i>No.</i>

431
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,144
So sad.

432
00:42:41,569 --> 00:42:44,319
Stand and fight, blind girl.

433
00:42:46,073 --> 00:42:47,539
I can't see.

434
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:49,742
That's your problem, not mine.

435
00:43:17,855 --> 00:43:19,438
See you tomorrow.

436
00:44:11,492 --> 00:44:15,377
Ser Davos, we have no cause to fight.

437
00:44:15,496 --> 00:44:17,629
We are both anointed knights.

438
00:44:17,715 --> 00:44:21,300
Hear that, lads?
Nothing to fear.

439
00:44:21,385 --> 00:44:23,552
<i>I will grant
amnesty to all brothers</i>

440
00:44:23,671 --> 00:44:26,004
<i>who throw down their arms
before nightfall.</i>

441
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:29,725
<i>And you, Ser Davos, I will
allow you to travel south</i>

442
00:44:29,844 --> 00:44:32,678
a free man with a fresh horse.

443
00:44:34,181 --> 00:44:36,398
<i>And some mutton.</i>

444
00:44:36,517 --> 00:44:38,066
<i>I'd like some mutton.</i>

445
00:44:38,185 --> 00:44:41,987
- What?
- I'm not much of a hunter.

446
00:44:42,072 --> 00:44:45,691
I'll need some food if I'm gonna
make it south without starving.

447
00:44:49,997 --> 00:44:51,697
We'll give you food.

448
00:44:51,832 --> 00:44:55,000
You can bring the Red Woman
with you if you like.

449
00:44:55,085 --> 00:44:58,537
<i>Or you can leave her here with
us, whichever you choose.</i>

450
00:44:58,622 --> 00:45:03,458
But surrender by nightfall
or this ends with blood.

451
00:45:05,012 --> 00:45:06,929
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

452
00:45:07,047 --> 00:45:11,183
We'll discuss amongst ourselves and
come back to you with an answer.

453
00:45:25,783 --> 00:45:30,485
Boys, I've been running
from men like that all my life.

454
00:45:30,571 --> 00:45:33,739
In my learned opinion,
we open that door--

455
00:45:33,824 --> 00:45:35,290
And they'll slaughter us all.

456
00:45:35,409 --> 00:45:37,709
They want to come in,
they're gonna come in.

457
00:45:37,795 --> 00:45:41,296
- Aye, but we don't need to make it
easy for them. - <i>Edd is our only chance.</i>

458
00:45:41,415 --> 00:45:44,750
It's a sad fucking statement if
Dolorous Edd is our only chance.

459
00:45:46,754 --> 00:45:48,253
There's always the Red Woman.

460
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:50,945
What's one redhead gonna do
against 40 armed men?

461
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,697
You haven't seen her do
what I've seen her do.

462
00:48:41,195 --> 00:48:49,195
