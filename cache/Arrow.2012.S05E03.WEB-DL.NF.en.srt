00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,795
I THINK PINNING IT ON ME
WAS THE BACKUP PLAN.

162
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,588
GUARD:
THAT'S TIME.

163
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,714
YOU BELIEVE ME, RIGHT?

164
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,300
JOHNNY, HOW CAN YOU
EVEN ASK THAT?

165
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,801
LYLA, I LOVE YOU.

166
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:46,263
TELL JOHN JR. I LOVE HIM
AND THAT I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

167
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,110
HEY, GET ME OUT OF HERE!

168
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,946
YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME
HERE WITH HIM!

169
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,489
HEY, JOHN.

170
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,159
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
CELLMATES AGAIN.

171
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,329
AIN'T THAT SOMETHING?

172
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:19,546
YOUR HONOR,
WE NEED TO TALK.

173
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,964
WHERE'D YOU GO LAST NIGHT?

174
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:21,882
I LOOKED AROUND THE THEATER
AFTER THE MOVIE,

175
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,424
AND I COULDN'T FIND YOU.

176
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,467
MR. MAYOR,
WE NEED TO TAKE
YOUR SECURITY DETAIL

177
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,468
MORE SERIOUSLY.

178
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,636
I WAS SERIOUS WHEN I SAID

179
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,180
THAT I DIDN'T WANT
A SECURITY DETAIL.

180
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,515
LOOK WHERE THAT GOT ME.

181
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,142
LATE FOR A MEETING.

182
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,729
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

183
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,189
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE UNTIL 9:00.

184
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,107
OUR MEETING WAS
SCHEDULED FOR 8:00.

185
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,984
EXACTLY.

186
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,778
WHO'S THIS?

187
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,280
THIS IS SUSAN WILLIAMS,

188
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,032
AND SHE IS OFFICIALLY
MY LEAST FAVORITE PERSON

189
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,449
ON THE PLANET.

190
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,868
SUSAN: IT'S NOT JUST
THAT OLIVER QUEEN'S

191
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,952
PICK FOR DEPUTY MAYOR

192
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,412
HAS A HISTORY
OF ALCOHOL ABUSE.

193
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,414
RECENT REPORTS CONFIRM
THAT QUENTIN LANCE

194
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,624
SUFFERED A RELAPSE

195
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,585
RIGHT BEFORE MAYOR QUEEN
APPOINTED HIM.

196
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,295
I TOLD YOU NOT
TO OFFER QUENTIN

197
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,588
A JOB IN THE ADMINISTRATION,

198
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,590
AND YOU DECIDE TO OFFER HIM
DEPUTY MAYOR?

199
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,176
OK, SO THAT'S WHAT THOSE
5 VOICEMAILS WERE ABOUT.

200
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,552
THE THING THAT
I TOLD YOU NOT TO DO?

201
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,763
I LISTENED TO WHAT YOU
TOLD ME NOT TO DO,

202
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,724
BUT THEN I DECIDED
TO DO WHAT I THOUGHT
WAS RIGHT, ANYWAY,

203
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,976
AND GUESS WHO I GOT
THAT ONE FROM.

204
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,395
I'M AN ELECTED OFFICIAL.

205
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,772
I HAVE TO ANSWER TO VOTERS
AND A FREE PRESS.

206
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,024
UNRAVEL THIS, SPEEDY.

207
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,276
MAKE IT GO AWAY.

208
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,610
THAT'S GOING TO BE
A LITTLE HARD TO DO

209
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,694
NOW THAT THE STORY'S
ALREADY OUT THERE.

210
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,071
I DON'T CARE.

211
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:30,033
YOU MADE THIS MESS.
YOU CLEAN IT UP.

212
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:37,249
ANATOLY: SOME NIGHTS,
I STILL FEEL THE SEA,

213
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,584
ROCKING, ROCKING.

214
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:43,255
IN THAT CAGE,
ON THAT BOAT, THE AMAZO.

215
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,256
DO YOU REMEMBER?

216
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,257
YEAH.

217
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,716
THEN I WAKE UP.

218
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,387
I REALIZE WHERE I AM
WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS.

219
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,638
YOU ARE ONLY ONE

220
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,223
WHO KNOWS WHAT
I WENT THROUGH,

221
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,808
THAT NIGHTMARE.

222
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,935
HERE. I BROUGHT YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK.

223
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,520
NO. NO, I CAN'T.

224
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,563
NOT VODKA.

225
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,982
IT'S WATER.

226
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,944
HOW YOU FEEL, MY FRIEND?

227
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,154
LIKE I MIGHT HAVE
MADE A MISTAKE.

228
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,406
BUT WHAT OF KOVAR?

229
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,116
YOU STILL WISH
TO KILL HIM, NO?

230
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,327
I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
BRATVA ONLY WAY.

231
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,203
I THINK I'LL TAKE
MY CHANCES.

232
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,622
THIS ABOUT OTHER MEN
BEING KILLED?

233
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,957
THIS WAS FIRST TEST.

234
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,000
TWO MORE LEFT.

235
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,418
WHAT WAS THE POINT
OF THE TEST?

236
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,295
TO TRUST BRATVA.

237
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,838
WELL, I'M SORRY, ANATOLY,

238
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,673
BUT I DON'T TRUST BRATVA

239
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:30,510
AFTER I WATCHED THEM
EXECUTE 3 INNOCENT MEN.

240
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,347
AH...

241
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,682
THERE IS MISCOMMUNICATION.

242
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:39,394
YOU WANT TO LEAVE, LEAVE,
BUT COME WITH ME FIRST.

243
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,230
I HAVE SOMETHING
I NEED TO SHOW YOU.

244
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,070
I CANNOT BELIEVE
I LET YOU TALK ME
INTO THIS.

245
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,530
YEAH.

246
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,658
I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED,
TOO, BUT IT'S JUST RECON.

247
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,243
IF IT'S JUST RECON,

248
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,786
THEN HOW COME WE DIDN'T
BRING ALONG RORY AND CURTIS?

249
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,289
BECAUSE CURTIS WOULD JUST
TELL MOMMY AND DADDY.

250
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,957
AND RORY?

251
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,377
GUY JUST WEIRDS ME OUT.

252
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,420
READY?

253
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,773
KNEW THIS WOULD
BE THE PLACE.

254
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,317
WHEN'S QUEEN
GOING TO TRUST ME?

255
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,651
EVELYN: I'M SURE IT'LL BE
RIGHT AFTER HE FINDS OUT

256
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,487
WE WENT HERE WITHOUT
HIS PERMISSION.

257
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:31,988
THE NIGHT'S STILL YOUNG.

258
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,031
BRING THE GREEN ARROW BACK,

259
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,324
BUST THIS PLACE UP.

260
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,410
YOU MEAN HE WILL
BUST THIS PLACE UP.

261
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,204
HE'LL NEVER LET US
GET OUT IN THAT FIELD.

262
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,043
IT'S EASIER TO ASK
FOR FORGIVENESS
THAN PERMISSION.

263
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,294
YOU BROUGHT THAT?

264
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,962
WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS
JUST BEING RECON?

265
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,006
WE DID THE RECON PART.

266
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,400
[GLASS SHATTERS]

267
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,338
[ALARM BLARING]

268
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,827
[GUNSHOT]

269
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,678
MRS. CONAHAN, THIS PERSON
WILL BE APPREHENDED.

270
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,183
I HAVE THE ANTI-CRIME UNIT
WORKING OVERTIME ON THIS.

271
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,643
TRUST ME.

272
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,894
WE WILL GET JUSTICE
FOR YOUR HUSBAND.

273
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,771
THOUGHT THAT WAS MY JOB.

274
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,064
GOOD-BYE.

275
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,108
I'M SORRY. YOU ARE?

276
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,943
PISSED. ROYALLY. OFF.

277
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,236
I'M GETTING THAT.

278
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,779
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IS WHO YOU ARE

279
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,615
AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IN MY OFFICE.

280
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:39,698
ADRIAN CHASE.

281
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,451
-YOUR NEW...
-DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

282
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:42,785
I'M SORRY
THAT WE HAVEN'T MET.

283
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,995
I'M BURIED
UP TO MY EYEBALLS

284
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,455
IN MOTION PRACTICE
AND INDICTMENTS

285
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:46,998
WITH A STAFF WHO'S
BARELY MADE IT PAST

286
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,542
3 ROUNDS OF BUDGET CUTS,

287
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,668
SO HOW ABOUT WE SAVE
THE PLEASANTRIES

288
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,751
FOR THE NEXT FUNDRAISER

289
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,128
AND GET DOWN
TO WHY I AM SO...

290
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,712
YOU'RE SO PISSED OFF.

291
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:54,713
ROYALLY.

292
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,049
REMEMBER VERTIGO?

293
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,634
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I TRIED TO BUY SOME ONCE.

294
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:58,717
YEAH, I BELIEVE IT.

295
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,802
WELL, WHAT'S HITTING
THE STREET

296
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,803
IS A MILLION TIMES
WORSE.

297
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,180
STARDUST.

298
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,682
I'M NOT AS OUT OF TOUCH
AS MOST PEOPLE THINK,

299
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,517
BUT I DO HAVE SOME WORK
TO GET DONE, MR. CHASE,

300
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,686
SO WHY DON'T WE GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF WHY
YOU'RE SO PISSED OFF?

301
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,145
I'VE BEEN BUILDING A CASE
AGAINST THE DEALER,

302
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,355
DEREK SAMPSON.

303
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,481
I WAS GOING TO FLIP HIM,

304
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,441
BUT LAST NIGHT
SOMEBODY KILLED HIM.

305
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,442
RIVAL DEALER?

306
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,902
A VIGILANTE.

307
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,195
THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE THE GREEN ARROW.

308
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:22,576
NOT HIM. SOME IDIOT
IN A HOCKEY MASK.

309
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,912
I'M SORRY. DID YOU SAY
A HOCKEY MASK?

310
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,040
EVERYTHING OK, BOSS?

311
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,585
A STARDUST DEALER WAS KILLED
LAST NIGHT BY A VIGILANTE.

312
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:32,586
LOTS RUNNING AROUND
THE CITY THESE DAYS...

313
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:33,628
WEARING A HOCKEY MASK!

314
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,879
HEY, SHORT FRY
WAS THERE, TOO!

315
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:35,838
THANKS, RENE.

316
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,964
RORY AND I DIDN'T,
THOUGH,

317
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,299
JUST FOR THE RECORD.

318
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,426
RENE: OK, I AIN'T GOING
TO DENY I WAS THERE,

319
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,759
BUT NEITHER

479
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,225
TO WHATEVER CHEMICALS
WERE IN THE VAT

480
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,769
THAT RENE
DUMPED HIM INTO.

481
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,187
ANY WAY TO REVERSE IT?

482
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,563
I COULD RUN SOME TESTS,
BUT IT WOULD TAKE TIME,

483
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,231
AND I'D RATHER KEEP MY EYE

484
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,026
ON THE "FIND SAMPSON BEFORE
HE HURTS ANYBODY ELSE" BALL.

485
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,777
CURTIS: WELL, GOOD THING
I WAS A BIOCHEMISTRY
MAJOR IN COLLEGE.

486
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,612
I'LL GET ON IT.

487
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,740
TEXT ME AS SOON
AS YOU HAVE ANYTHING.

488
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,367
WE CAN'T LET THE COPS
GET TO HIM FIRST.

489
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,285
I WANT TO HELP, TOO.

490
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,787
I THINK YOU'VE
DONE ENOUGH.

491
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,706
I'M SORRY ABOUT BEFORE,
BUT I GET IT NOW.

492
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,166
I'LL DO WHATEVER
YOU NEED.

493
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,542
OLIVER: WHAT I NEED

494
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,085
IS TO TRUST THAT WHEN
I DO ASK FOR YOUR HELP,

495
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,504
YOU'RE NOT IMMEDIATELY GOING
TO MAKE THE PROBLEM WORSE.

496
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,214
RORY: HE SAID
HE WAS SORRY.

497
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,549
LET US HELP.

498
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,425
YEAH. WE COULD
CANVASS THE CITY.

499
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,845
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
THE LAST TIME YOU WENT
LOOKING FOR SAMPSON?

500
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,680
PASS.

501
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,110
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

502
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,781
DA.

503
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,834
THANK YOU.

504
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,481
THE RECRUIT
WAS A MURDERER?

505
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,816
YEAH.

506
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:16,901
POLICE CATCH HIM,

507
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,402
BUT HE'S SON
TO FRIEND OF KOVAR

508
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,071
SO HE GOES FREE.

509
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,448
BRATVA STEP IN
TO BRING JUSTICE.

510
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,825
HOW IS RECRUITING HIM
INTO THE BRATVA JUSTICE?

511
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,161
BUT HE WAS NOT
RECRUITED, WAS HE?

512
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,956
WHAT IF I WASN'T THE ONE
TO RING THE BELL, ANATOLY?

513
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,498
WE STILL BRING JUSTICE.

514
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,917
IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO CONVINCE ME

515
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,043
TO TRUST THE BRATVA,

516
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,544
YOU ARE NOT DOING
A VERY GOOD JOB.

517
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,131
YOU MUST TRUST PROCESS.

518
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,382
NOT EVERYTHING
WHAT IT SEEMS.

519
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,052
TO DEFEAT KOVAR,
YOU NEED ARMY.

520
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:46,472
BRATVA ARMY.

521
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,307
YOU'VE COME THIS FAR.

522
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,059
WHY GIVE UP NOW?

523
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,441
6 OF HEARTS.

524
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,486
COME ON, 6 OF HEARTS,
WHERE ARE YOU?

525
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,988
MY KINGDOM
FOR A 6 OF HEARTS.

526
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,448
YOU SHUT UP 5 FOR MINUTES,
I WON'T HAVE TO KILL YOU.

527
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,575
WHOO! THERE'S THAT TEMPER.

528
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,119
GOOD THING YOUR KID WON'T
HAVE TO GROW UP WITH IT

529
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,246
LIKE YOUR BROTHER DID, HUH?

530
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,789
WHAT'D YOU SAY TO ME?

531
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,250
HOW'S ALL THAT
GOING, ANYWAY?

532
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:17,170
YOU EVER FIND THAT GROUP
THAT PAID ME TO OFF HIM?

533
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,212
THEY DIDN'T.

534
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,380
WHAT'S THAT, NOW?

535
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,592
THEY DIDN'T
WANT HIM DEAD.

536
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,469
HE WAS ALIVE.

537
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,847
LIKE I SAID,
HELL OF A WORLD, AIN'T IT?

538
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,932
I MEAN...

539
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:35,646
WAIT, WHY DID YOU SAY
"WAS ALIVE" JUST NOW? HUH?

540
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,481
HELLO, JOHN?
ANYBODY HOME?

541
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,899
BECAUSE I KILLED HIM.

542
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,324
SO ALL THAT HATE
THAT YOU POURED INTO ME

543
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,034
FOR KILLING YOUR BROTHER,

544
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,204
YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN
POURING IT INTO YOURSELF.

545
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,919
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY
TO SEE YOU.

546
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,087
WHAT CAN I HELP YOU WITH?

547
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,881
SCPD IS WORKING
ON LOCATING SAMPSON.

548
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,591
I WANT TO START WITH
A SEARCH OF HIS LAST
KNOWN ADDRESS,

549
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,260
BUT JUDGE PITTSON WON'T
SIGN THE SEARCH WARRANT

550
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,470
ON SAMPSON'S
PRIOR RESIDENCE.

551
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,805
PITTSON. I HELPED
PITTSON GET ELECTED.

552
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,224
WHICH IS WHY I'M
TALKING TO YOU.

553
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,516
COULD YOU LEAN ON HER?

554
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,560
ABSOLUTELY.
ALL HANDS ON DECK.

555
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,853
THANK YOU.

556
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,938
HEY, YOU...YOU PROBABLY
DON'T REMEMBER THIS,

557
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,732
BUT WE ACTUALLY
MET 12 YEARS AGO.

558
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,275
YOU TRIED TO PICK UP
MY GIRLFRIEND.

559
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,776
HA HA HA!

560
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,653
I DID A LOT OF THINGS
BACK THEN

561
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,197
THAT I'M NOT
ESPECIALLY PROUD OF,

562
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,657
BUT I'M SURE SHE ENDED UP
WITH THE BETTER MAN.

563
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:29,658
HELL, NO.

564
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,659
SHE WENT HOME WITH YOU.

565
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:31,869
HEH HEH HEH!

566
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,205
IT'S OK.
I DON'T HOLD GRUDGES.

567
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,249
LOOKS LIKE YOUR
CHIEF OF STAFF
NEEDS A MINUTE.

568
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,333
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'VE
TALKED TO PITTSON.

569
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,334
I APPRECIATE IT.

570
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:39,501
OF COURSE.

571
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,174
HOW DID IT GO
WITH THAT REPORTER?

572
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:47,218
WELL, I THOUGHT
IT WENT WELL.

573
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,594
THOUGHT?

574
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,595
UM...

575
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,390
SUSAN, ON SCREEN:
UNFORTUNATELY,
MAYOR QUEEN

576
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,933
DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE
THE FIRST CLUE

577
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,476
OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITHIN
HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION.

578
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,187
-FOR THOSE OF YOU...
-I'M SO SORRY.

579
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,980
WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO THIS WOMAN?

580
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,275
THAT PART'S COMING NEXT.

581
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,735
SUSAN, ON SCREEN:
BUT "CHOSEN" MAY BE
TOO STRONG OF A WORD.

582
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,487
NOT ONLY WAS A DISGRACED
PUBLIC OFFICIAL REHIRED
BY THE CITY

583
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,906
IN AN EVEN
HIGHER POSITION,

584
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,658
MAYOR QUEEN WASN'T
EVEN AWARE OF IT.

585
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,787
THE DECISION WAS MADE
BY HIS SISTER.

586
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,123
OK, LOOK, I AM GOING
TO ISSUE A STATEMENT

587
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,750
TAKING FULL
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THIS, OK?

588
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,419
AND THEN I AM GOING
TO OFFER YOU

589
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,421
MY LETTER
OF RESIGNATION.

590
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,713
-THEA...
-NO, OLLIE, LOOK,

591
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:25,756
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.

592
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,592
I MADE THIS MESS.

593
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,719
I'M GOING TO GO
CLEAN IT UP.

594
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,851
YOU KNOW IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

595
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,186
BEFORE RORY
FIGURES IT OUT.

596
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,478
WHAT?

597
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,231
THE YOU AND HAVENROCK
CONNECTION.

598
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:43,481
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T SEEM
TO BE AROUND THE GUY

599
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,482
FOR MORE THAN
TWO MINUTES

600
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,818
WITHOUT ACTING WIDGY,

601
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,194
AND SOONER OR LATER,
HE'S GOING TO ASK WHY.

602
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,029
WELL, I WILL TAKE
THE "LATER." THANK YOU.

603
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,781
HAVE YOU TALKED THIS
OUT WITH OLIVER?

604
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,200
NO. OLIVER AND I
DON'T HAVE THAT TYPE
OF RELATIONSHIP ANYMORE,

605
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,285
AND YOU'RE RIGHT,

606
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,786
I AM ACTING WIDGY

607
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,288
BECAUSE HAVING HIM
ON THE TEAM

608
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,789
IS LIKE HAVING A CONSTANT
REMINDER ABOUT WHAT I DID.

609
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,124
SO CLEAR THE AIR.

610
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,418
IF THE PAST 4 YEARS HAVE
TAUGHT YOU ANYTHING,

611
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,045
IT SHOULD BE THAT KEEPING
SECRETS NEVER WORKS OUT.

612
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,046
I HARDLY EVEN KNOW RORY,

613
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,423
AND WHAT I DO KNOW
ABOUT HIM

614
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:09,008
IS THAT HE HAS SEVERAL-
THOUSAND-YEAR-OLD RAGS

615
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,634
THAT HE CAN MYSTICALLY
USE TO STRANGLE ME.

616
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,761
HE MUST BE GREAT
AT PARTIES.

617
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:15,139
I THINK THAT YOU NEED
TO JUST TRUST THE FACT

618
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,974
THAT HE WILL
NOT KILL YOU

619
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,310
AND TRUST THAT HE MAY
BE ABLE TO SEE THINGS
CLEARER THAN YOU DO

620
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:22,104
AND KNOW THAT THIS
WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

621
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,651
WHOEVER CALLED
THIS MEETING,

622
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,195
YOU BEST STEP OUT.

623
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,905
THE TEXT I GOT CAME
FROM SAMPSON'S CELL.

624
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,158
SAMPSON IS DEAD.

625
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,535
SAMPSON:
WHAT'D MARK TWAIN SAY?

626
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,038
"REPORTS OF MY DEATH

627
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:43,000
HAVE BEEN GREATLY
EXAGGERATED."

628
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,211
MAN, HE WASN'T KIDDING.

629
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,962
MAN: RIGHTEOUS.

630
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:50,090
SO WE'RE BACK IN BUSINESS?

631
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,008
STARDUST.

632
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,135
NO, I'M THINKING...

633
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,345
BIGGER.

634
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:55,553
YOU GO BIGGER,

635
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,763

SEE THIS.

780
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,140
I FOUND OUT
WHAT SAMPSON STOLE

781
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,308
FROM ALLMAN INDUSTRIAL,

782
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,435
A MOLECULAR
TRANSMODALITY PROCESSOR.

783
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:36,436
WHAT?

784
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,563
IT REPLICATES CHEMICALS

785
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,689
BASED ON THEIR
MOLECULAR STRUCTURE.

786
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:40,190
WHAT WOULD SAMPSON
NEED WITH THAT?

787
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,983
THE VAT THAT YOU
DROPPED HIM IN.

788
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,151
RENE: IT WAS FULL
OF STARDUST.

789
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,611
WHEN WE WERE FIGHTING,
A PIPE BURST,

790
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:46,530
AND SOME LIQUID DRAINED
FROM IT INTO THE VAT.

791
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:47,906
SOUNDS LIKE HE STUMBLED
ON THE RECIPE

00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,287
ABOUT HAVENROCK.

955
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:59,374
HAVENROCK WAS NOT
THE INTENDED TARGET.

956
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:02,919
MONUMENT POINT WAS.

957
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,879
SOMEONE REDIRECTED
THE MISSILE

958
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,382
TO REDUCE THE NUMBER
OF CASUALTIES.

959
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:12,762
THAT SOMEONE WAS ME.

960
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:17,392
I AM SO SORRY.

961
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,574
OLIVER.

962
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,076
LYLA?

963
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,619
WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT JOHN.

964
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:37,662
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

965
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,038
NO. HE'S BACK
IN THE COUNTRY,

966
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,999
AND HE'S IN PRISON,

967
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,376
AND I NEED YOU
TO BREAK HIM OUT.
