1
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,060
Thad...

2
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,980
I said no toys at Grandfather's.

3
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,190
But it's Christmas.

4
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,190
- Stop it!
- Hey.

5
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
Hey, Dad!

6
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,240
Hey! Thad,

7
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,070
you can't go crying to
other people all the time.

8
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,790
A man needs to know
when to stand up for himself.

9
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,910
Dear Magic-Isn't-Real Ball,

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,750
will Thad ever be a man?

11
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,300
Ouch.

12
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,210
"Outlook not so good."

13
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,600
You broke it.

14
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,560
Dad? Sid?

15
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,320
Someone help me!

16
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,080
Help!

17
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,850
Hello?

18
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,540
Thaddeus.

19
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,910
Thaddeus Sivana.

20
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,330
Who are you?

21
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,290
How do you know my name?

22
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,750
I am the last of the
Council of Wizards.

23
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,590
Sworn to protect the realms
from the Seven Deadly Sins.

24
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,890
But years have passed,

25
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,430
and I grow weak.

26
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,230
That is why I seek a champion

27
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,480
to inherit my magic.

28
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,110
You want me to do magic?

29
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,070
With this,

30
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,780
all of my powers
will become yours.

31
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,910
Ah. But first...

32
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,000
you must demonstrate
that you're pure of heart

33
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,120
and strong in spirit.

34
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,460
He lies.

35
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,880
Don't be his champion.

36
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,680
We can give you power.

37
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,310
Take the eye.

38
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,640
Take it.

39
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,030
Your father thinks you're weak.

40
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,110
Show him your power.

41
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,240
Take the eye.

42
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,250
No!

43
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,880
What?

44
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,300
What happened?

45
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,050
Only the purest of hearts
can resist their temptations.

46
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,970
But you,

47
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,720
you will never be worthy.

48
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,100
Wait.

49
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,230
- I'm good enough, I swear!
- What?

50
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,570
Let me back in!

51
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,230
Calm down, Thad!

52
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,460
- Don't open the door!
- Stop it!

53
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,690
- Calm down.
- Stop!

54
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,420
Hey, I'm gonna kill
you, you little freak!

55
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,740
Stop... Oh!

56
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,930
I was just there.

57
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,180
This man, this wizard, he
took me to a castle and...

58
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,640
Stop. Stop!

59
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,060
Stop it!

60
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,020
You miserable,
whiny, little shit!

61
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,940
You could have killed us!

62
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,650
Do you understand that?

63
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,240
Dad?

64
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Dad!

65
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,130
Dad?

66
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,340
You're okay.

67
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,130
You're gonna be okay.

68
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,140
You did this.

69
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,680
You did this!

70
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,190
No.

71
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,270
Dad.

72
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,550
Your magic grows weak.

73
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,010
Soon, you won't be
able to contain us.

74
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
Seeking Spell,

75
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,350
find me one soul who is worthy.

76
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,770
No matter how long it takes.

77
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,530
Improved by KID 

Resynced by KID 

Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

78
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,110
Holy moly! The boys in blue!

79
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,860
Sure glad to see you.

80
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,990
I called as soon as I saw.

81
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,240
They're in there.

82
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,410
You stay here.

83
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,290
Police!

84
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,130
I saw 'em hide back in there.

85
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,760
- Police, coming in!
- Police!

86
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,570
- There's nobody here.
- What do you mean?

87
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,510
- It's a closet.
- You really bought that, huh?

88
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,270
- Hey, no, no, no!
- Hey!

89
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,190
Stop, stop, stop!

90
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,770
Open this up right now, kid.

91
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,780
That's a federal offense,
kid. You can't do that!

92
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,700
Do not go in that car.

93
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,020
Come on, open the door. Please.

94
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,570
Please, come on.

95
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,540
Open this, right now!

96
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,540
Very good, very funny.

97
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,300
Very funny. That's
great. That's hilarious.

98
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,470
Uh, Dispatch, we need backup at the
Laurelwood shopping center, please.

99
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,180
Dispatch, cancel that request.

100
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,300
Some kid stole
our walkie-talkies.

101
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,310
Walkie-talkies? How old are you?

102
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,770
No, no, no.

103
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,860
That's my lunch, kid!

104
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,610
Miss Batson...

105
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,280
I've been looking for you.

106
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,660
No. Gosh.

107
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,540
It's me. It's Billy.

108
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,630
Okay.

109
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,550
I want the tiger.

110
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,430
I know, honey, I know. But
Mom's not exactly going pro here.

111
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,060
We got one!

112
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,400
But I wanted a tiger.

113
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,110
Oh, but this is the
real prize, baby. See?

114
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,110
You can use that
your whole life.

115
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,330
You'll always find your way.

116
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,600
I can't let the ball get away.

117
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,820
Mom?

118
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,070
Mom!

119
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,160
Mom!

120
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,380
Hey.

121
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,670
Who are you with, bud?

122
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,670
Yeah, he says it's Billy Batson.

123
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,680
Hey, don't worry, kid.

124
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,320
I'm sure she'll come
looking before too long, okay?

125
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,060
They always do.

126
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,900
Mom, I'm home.

127
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
Yes?

128
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,270
Yeah, uh, is this Rachel Batson?

129
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,690
Who's asking?

130
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,070
Um...

131
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,650
Yeah, see, the thing is...

132
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,820
I think you're my mom.

133
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,700
You sure about that?

134
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,330
Sorry to bother you.

135
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,510
Just had to take my lunch, huh?

136
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,170
You save me any fries?

137
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,430
Foster home in Pittsburgh
reported you missing two weeks ago.

138
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,510
You're sending me back?

139
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,100
No.

140
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,890
They don't want you.

141
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,650
- Harsh.
- You laugh,

142
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,020
but you've run from foster
homes in six counties, Mr. Batson.

143
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,110
From good people

144
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,240
who want you, all
in pursuit of someone

145
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,030
who arguably does not.

146
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,080
It's time someone looked you in
the eye and told it to you straight.

147
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,500
I don't need parents to
play make-believe with.

148
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,580
- I got a mom.
- Yes.

149
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,000
You're some detective.

150
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,260
Seventy-three Batsons

151
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,550
between the ages of 28 to 40,
and you've crossed out every one.

152
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,890
She's still out
there. I know it.

153
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,270
There's a couple
outside, Mr. Batson.

154
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,940
They run a group home.

155
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,070
I can take care of myself.

156
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,360
When you're 18.

157
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,660
Until then, I won't have
you living on the streets,

158
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,740
looking for someone
who never looked for you.

159
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,330
Give these people a chance.

160
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,330
'Cause that's what
they're giving you.

161
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,540
You're out of options.

162
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,720
I'm gonna skip the spiel.

163
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,600
Just know that me
and Rosa, we get it.

164
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,180
We were foster
kids back in the day.

165
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,770
Ooh, back in the Dark Ages.

166
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,350
Girl, I'm young at heart.

167
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,900
I got my finger on the pulse.

168
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,980
Yeah, that's a reference

169
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,780
to his blood pressure
because he's old.

170
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,400
Billy, do you have
any food allergies?

171
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,240
Gonna wish you
did. Darla's cooking.

172
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,910
What?

173
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,080
We know how
overwhelming it can all be.

174
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,910
New house, new faces.

175
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,580
All up in your face.

176
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,250
Just take it at your own speed.

177
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,300
Hello?

178
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,930
We're home.

179
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,100
That's what happens
when you suck!

180
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,850
So much for the welcome party.

181
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,060
Yeah, that thing
growing out of the couch

182
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,520
would be Eugene.

183
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,940
Is that him?

184
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,900
Oh, my gosh! Billy!

185
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,200
Whoa! Slow down, slow down.

186
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,360
Welcome home!

187
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,410
- And that's Darla.
- I'm Darla.

188
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,390
Big hugger.

189
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,780
I noticed.

190
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,080
Die, die, die!

191
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,830
He doesn't mean
that. It's a game.

192
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,580
Hey.

193
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,590
No sodas after dark, remember?

194
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,840
Whoa. When did it get dark?

195
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,880
Oh, the poster. I made you one.

196
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,220
Come look! Oh, no!

197
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,510
Sorry, Pedro must've
been working out.

198
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,680
His goal is to get swole.

199
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,390
Just one hit! Just one hit!

200
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Oh...

201
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,810
Here.

202
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,770
Yes, exactly why your math
department is so uniquely suited for me.

203
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,400
Shut up! No!

204
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,650
I can't even with
Eugene right now.

205
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,360
I'm sorry. Mary, hi.
College interview.

206
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,490
I'm Billy.

207
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,070
What am I most excited about?

208
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,540
Oh! What a great question.
I was hoping you'd ask.

209
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,160
What am I most excited about?

210
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,290
Mention you're a foster
kid. Colleges eat that up.

211
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,710
What I'm most excited about
is the campus experience.

212
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,260
As a foster child, I'm a big
believer in finding family and friends

213
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,590
in the most unlikely of places.

214
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
I'm gonna miss
that girl so much.

215
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,480
It's Caltech. It's a
very prestigious school.

216
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,440
And also all the
way in California.

217
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,850
But we don't have to
talk about that right now.

218
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,270
It's a tough subject for me.

219
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,570
Do you like vegan food?

220
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,860
- Mmm-mmm.
- Because, see, I love animals.

221
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,610
Oh, no! The Tofurky!

222
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,410
Oh, no, we may have
to eat a real turkey!

223
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,570
- Is that...
- It's okay.

224
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,030
Come, I'll show you your room.

225
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,870
It's a bit of a madhouse,
I know, but it's fun.

226
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,540
Time to dance on your grave!

227
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,210
Watch the bum step. Pedro...

228
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,240
Say hi to Billy.

229
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,800
Don't take it personally.
He's like that with everyone.

230
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,850
Freddy.

231
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,770
This is Billy Batson.

232
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,350
Make sure you make
him feel at home.

233
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,560
- Okay?
- Yeah.

234
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,560
Maybe don't say
anything too weird?

235
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,690
Oh, one weird thing is,

236
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,450
did you know that Romans used
to brush their teeth with their urine?

237
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,320
And apparently, it works.

238
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,490
Yep. Um...

239
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,000
Oh, it's a long way down.

240
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,290
Trust me, I speak
from experience.

241
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,300
Victor pushed me.

242
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,840
They seem nice,
but don't buy it.

243
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,350
It gets real Game of
Thrones around here.

244
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,470
What?

245
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,560
Dude, I'm just messin' around.

246
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,150
It's, um, terminal cancer.
I only have three months.

247
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,280
Kidding, again! You look
at me, and you're like,

248
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,840
"Why so dark? You're a disabled
foster kid. You've got it all."

249
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,950
Right?

250
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,790
Oh, yeah, that's
the old Batarang.

251
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,580
I mean, it's a replica,
but feel how sharp.

252
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,500
I could kill you in your
sleep with that thing.

253
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,920
You more of a Supes guy?

254
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,510
Yeah, me, too.
Behold, the holy grail.

255
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,130
One nine-millimeter round
shot at Superman himself.

256
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,260
It's legit.

257
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,470
Probably worth, I don't know,
five, six hundred, maybe more.

258
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,560
What's in the bag?

259
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,270
Hey.

260
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,690
Hey, it's all good. It's good
to maintain boundaries.

261
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,400
You don't gotta talk
so much, you know.

262
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,820
Anyway, this place is
great. You're gonna love it.

263
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,760
Dinner!

264
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,810
All hands on deck.

265
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,770
Thank you for this family.

266
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,030
Thank you for this day.

267
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:01,030
Thank you for this food,
even if it's not steak filet.

268
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,120
Big school. 2,000
students, you might think,

269
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,750
"Wow, so many strangers."

270
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,370
But not if you think of them
as possible future friends.

271
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,880
Then it's, "Wow,
so many friends."

272
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,920
The principal, her name's
Shirley. She's the best.

273
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,800
Next.

274
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,510
This is our security scanner.

275
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,970
Like in an airport.
It's totally safe.

276
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,510
I know what it is.

277
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,140
- Does she always do this?
- Mmm-hmm.

278
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,520
Silence makes me uncomfortable.

279
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,060
She's almost never
uncomfortable.

280
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,920
Have a good first
day, big brother.

281
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,150
Look, you don't have
to hug me all the time.

282
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,440
We're not actually
brother and sister, so...

283
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,580
- Hey.
- Hey.

285
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,750
I didn't mean to make her...

286
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,540
I was overwhelmed, honestly.

287
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,300
He said I must be pure of heart.

288
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,880
He call himself a wizard.

289
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,300
He even dressed like a wizard
from Harry Potter or some...

290
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,810
But you're saying that other
people have experienced this?

291
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:16,600
In a sense, yes. Do you
remember what he said to you?

292
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,770
He tested me.

293
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,940
There were these statues.

294
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,450
Their eyes, it's like they were
looking at me, making me think things.

295
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,700
Horrible things.

296
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,370
And do these
approximate what you saw?

297
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,420
Yes, that's exactly
how I remember it.

298
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,830
I don't understand.
How do you know...

299
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,050
Recurrent imagery has proven very
common in cases of mass hysteria.

300
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,300
Mass hysteria?

301
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,010
I know. The term's
a bit theatrical.

302
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,850
But take UFO
sightings, for example.

303
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,430
Lights in the sky,
flying saucers.

304
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,350
Isolated incidents of people
who do not know each other...

305
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,810
The symbols.

306
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,070
Ask her about the symbols.

307
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,990
Sorry, Ms. Kwan. But as an
example of recurrent imagery,

308
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,950
maybe you'll recall seeing

309
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,660
these symbols before
the alleged abduction.

310
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,540
I don't remember
any symbols, no.

311
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,170
I think I got it on video.
There was something, um...

312
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,250
I remember the numbers
on my alarm clock.

313
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,590
They kept shifting.

314
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,670
Video?

315
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,220
Show me the video.

316
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,220
Uh, Ms. Kwan,
this is Dr. Sivana.

317
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,560
Um, one moment, I can send it.

318
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,350
Hello? Oh, my God!

319
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,480
Who's there?

320
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,480
Hello? What's going
on? What's happening?

321
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,570
I'm going to call the police!

322
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,320
Then this blinding
light all around me

323
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,660
and I felt like I was getting
pulled down into something.

324
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,620
It felt like a temple
carved inside a mountain.

325
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,560
He looked exactly what you'd expect
from a guy who calls himself a wizard.

326
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,710
and how you were brought
there to save the world.

327
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,750
- Wearing a cape.
- And there's no ceiling.

328
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,050
We ran the numbers again...

329
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,630
Dr. Sivana!

330
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:11,050
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but you're funding my project.

331
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,140
And when I'm interviewing,
I don't wanna be interrupted.

332
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,350
Fifty-six recorded abductions.

333
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,680
- I never saw it.
- Saw what?

334
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,410
Doctor, what is all this?

335
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,410
All these years...

336
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,420
I was convinced I had
the incorrect sequence.

337
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,420
Or perhaps the wrong symbols

338
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,090
to open the door.

339
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,680
But on that woman's alarm
clock, the seven symbols.

340
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,650
The sequence repeated
itself seven times.

341
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,360
That's the difference.

342
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,480
Is this some sort of joke?

343
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,450
It may seem that way to you

344
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,160
because we're not in actuality
studying mass hysteria.

345
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,780
What all these people have seen,

346
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,960
every single one of
them, is absolutely real.

347
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,210
An alarm clock malfunctions

348
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,300
and your first thought
is it's proof of a wizard?

349
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,510
- Hmm.
- Come on, Dr. Sivana.

350
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,010
You can't believe
any of this is real.

351
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,900
Why, yes.

352
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,740
Yes, I do.

353
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,860
I've been waiting for
this moment for so long...

354
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,870
and now here we are.

355
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,410
You don't remember me, do you?

356
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,000
I remember you.

357
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,090
You were a boy.

358
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,180
And now you dare
intrude in my kingdom.

359
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,970
Do you know what it's like for a child
to be told you'll never be good enough?

360
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,140
No, you don't.

361
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,810
What you said to me all those years
ago made me realize who I really was.

362
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,440
And you know something?

363
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,400
I am not pure of heart.

364
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,530
The wizard is too
weak to stop us.

365
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,120
No!

366
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,370
No!

367
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,130
You never found your champion.

368
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,470
But we found ours.

369
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,610
You are the true champion.

370
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,440
They're using you.

371
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,190
You're nothing to them
but a means of escape.

372
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,240
Through you, they'll spread their
poison to everything they touch!

373
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,160
Make mankind turn on each other!

374
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,670
You seek a pure soul, old man,

375
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,920
but no one's worthy.

376
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,640
Flight or invisibility?

377
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,310
If you could have
one superpower,

378
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,350
flight or invisibility,
what would you pick?

379
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,020
I mean, everybody chooses
flight. You know why?

380
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,980
So they can fly away
from this conversation?

381
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,480
No, no. 'Cause heroes fly.

382
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,840
And who doesn't want people
to think they're a hero, right?

383
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,030
But invisibility, no way.

384
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,280
That's pervy.

385
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,920
Spying around on people who
don't even know you're there.

386
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,530
Sneaking around everywhere.
It's a total villain power, right?

387
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,940
Then they did this study,
and this is a real thing.

388
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,160
They asked people the same question.
You know, what power do you want?

389
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,230
But this time, they made it so
the answers were anonymous.

390
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,430
And most people, since they knew
that it was secret, said invisibility.

391
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,820
And I think that's
'cause most people

392
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,390
don't feel like heroes
on the inside, deep down.

393
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,510
You're gonna run away.

394
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,390
I mean, you stole
my Superman bullet.

395
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,020
Dude, I get it. I get it.

396
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,660
You've been screwed
over way too many times.

397
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,860
You don't trust anyone.

398
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,150
That's the thing about invisibility.
You end up all by yourself.

399
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,910
I didn't steal your dumb bullet.

400
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,250
Hey. How was it today?

401
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,750
That good, huh'?

402
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,880
Whoa!

403
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,920
Oh, my God! Freddy.

404
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:21,920
Are you okay?

405
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,420
- You okay?
- Yes. Yes.

406
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,300
What the hell?

407
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,910
- What is wrong with you two?
- Oh, ho!

408
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,010
No way that's gonna buff out.

409
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,430
You gonna pay for that, Freeman?

410
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,080
For the dent you
made almost hitting me?

411
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,190
Yeah, sure. Um...

412
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,270
You guys take these?

413
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,400
Brett, stop!

414
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,740
Don't touch my brother!

415
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,670
What, do you need your
fake family to stand up for you?

416
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,500
- Stand up for yourself, Freeman.
- Yeah, huh?

417
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,080
Hey, Freeman.
Freeman, here, stand up.

418
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,240
Stand up for yourself.

419
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,100
What are you gonna do,
go home and cry to Mommy?

420
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,500
Oh, yeah. You
don't have a mommy.

421
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,500
Hey.

422
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,050
Man, sorry about that.

423
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:04,840
That wasn't fair, but then
again you don't fight fair, so...

424
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,470
Back off, assbags. I know
how to use these things.

425
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,290
Hey! He's getting
away! Where you going?

426
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,610
Freddy, are you okay?

427
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,710
Hey, let's go through the back.

428
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

429
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:35,960
Nowhere to run!

430
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,250
Hey!

431
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,130
- Go, go, go!
- Grab him! Move!

432
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,500
- Get out the way.
- Move, woman!

433
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:42,630
Whoa!

434
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,840
No, no, no.

435
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,380
You're dead, kid.

436
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,720
Yeah, you think you're funny.

437
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,640
We know where you
go to school, buddy!

438
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,060
Woman on PM Next
stop, 30th Street Station.

439
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,060
Change for the
regional rail lines.

440
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,160
Uh... Hello?

441
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,830
What's going on?

442
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,140
Help!

443
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,910
Okay.

444
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,090
Holy moly.

445
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,690
Hello?

446
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,710
What the hell?

447
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,880
Who's doing this?

448
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,160
Hi. Um...

449
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,750
I was supposed
to get off at 30th.

450
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,040
Billy Batson.

451
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,790
How'd you know my name?

452
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,630
I am the last of the
Council of Wizards.

453
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,880
Keeper of the Rock of Eternity.

454
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,590
Oh...

455
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,050
You're...

456
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,550
that guy.

457
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,390
Hey, listen, I don't
have any money.

458
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,470
Do not patronize me, boy.

459
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:47,440
You are standing in
the source of all magic.

460
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,650
The Rock of Eternity. Seven
thrones of seven wizards.

461
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,240
But long ago, we
chose a champion

462
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,120
and we chose recklessly.

463
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,660
He used his power for revenge,

464
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:08,750
releasing the Seven
Deadly Sins into your world.

465
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,090
Millions of lives were lost.

466
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:19,550
Entire civilizations
erased from existence.

467
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,350
That is why I vowed
never to pass on my magic

468
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,650
until I find one
truly good person.

469
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,690
Strong in spirit,

470
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,780
pure in heart.

471
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,450
Look, man, maybe this is magic

472
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,830
and, I don't know,

473
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:46,040
but the people you're
looking for, good, pure people,

474
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,920
I'm not one of them.

475
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,750
I don't know if
anyone is, really.

476
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,340
You, Billy Batson,

477
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,720
are all I have.

478
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,010
All the world has.

479
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,350
Lay your hands on my staff.

480
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,470
Gross.

481
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,140
And say my name so my
powers may flow through you.

482
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,230
I open my heart
to you, Billy Batson.

483
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,440
And in so doing,
choose you as champion.

484
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,150
Thanks.

485
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,240
Real sweet of you, mister,
but I really gotta get going.

486
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,910
My brothers and sisters
were slain by the Sins.

487
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,750
Their thrones lie empty.

488
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:30,040
My magic must be passed on.

489
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,790
Now, speak my name!

490
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,090
I don't know your
name, sir. We just met.

491
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,760
My name is...

492
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,090
Shazam.

493
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,390
Wait, for real?

494
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,100
- "Say it!
- OKay!"

495
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,850
Jeez.

496
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,990
So just say it'? Like...

497
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,120
Shazam?

498
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,240
Yes!

499
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,700
Carry my name, and with
it, you carry all my powers.

500
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:11,580
The wisdom of Solomon,
the strength of Hercules,

501
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,960
the stamina of Atlas,
the power of Zeus,

502
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,670
the courage of Achilles,
and the speed of Mercury.

503
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,100
What happened to me? Why am...

504
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,190
What did you do to me?
What did you do to my voice?

505
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:36,940
You have been transformed to
your full potential, Billy Batson.

506
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:41,820
With your heart, unlock
your greatest power.

507
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,780
The thrones of our
brothers and sisters await.

508
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,050
Get me outta here!

509
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,800
Dope!

510
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,390
My brother, I applaud
your choices today.

511
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,220
Gold shoes, gold
belt, white cape.

512
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,640
It shouldn't work,
but hot damn, it does!

513
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,900
Ow!

514
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,070
Hey!

515
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,990
Hey, babe!

516
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,370
Yes, Officer.

517
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,210
I'm aware he's run
away in the past.

518
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,800
Twenty-three times?

519
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,970
Guy's got no social
media presence. At all.

520
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,180
The guy is a ghost.

521
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,700
You know, guys, I'm
happy to look for Billy.

522
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,120
More than happy.

523
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,750
But no, you gotta wash the
dishes. That's what's more important.

524
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,390
"What are you gonna
do, Freddy, run after him?"

525
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,670
Very funny.

526
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,210
No, I said, don't scream.

527
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,800
- Uh... Victor? Victor!
- No, no!

528
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,260
- Victor!
- It's me. It's Billy.

529
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,420
It's Billy!

530
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:28,340
You asked me flight or
invisibility. I thought that was stupid,

531
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,470
but now I look like this
and I need your help.

532
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,760
Meet me back
here after lights-out?

533
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,730
'Sup, bud? You all right?

534
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,060
Yeah. Yeah. I'm just...

535
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:43,070
I'm really sad
because Billy's gone.

536
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:46,780
And, you know, maybe
it's my fault. Maybe I did it.

537
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,570
Uh, you know, maybe I snore.

538
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,160
Hey, hey, hey. Not
your fault, son, all right?

539
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,330
We'll find him, 'kay?

540
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,500
You don't snore that bad.

541
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,620
But you kinda smell.

542
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,300
Oh, thank God!

543
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,510
Hey. Stop right there.

544
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,950
How do I know you're not a
supervillain using telepathic abilities

545
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,810
to make me believe
that you're Billy? Huh?

546
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:17,890
What?

547
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,160
All I have to do is
press "dial" on this thing.

548
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,150
No! No., I have proof.
I have proof. Here.

549
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,820
Look, I lied, okay?
I took your bullet.

550
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,900
- Oh, no! No., no, no.
- No!

551
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,320
Stupid adult hands.

552
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,490
But you saw it.

553
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:34,280
You saw it, right? Look,
Freddy, I swear. It's me, okay?

554
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,260
Look, I know we're not really
close friends or anything,

555
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,470
but you're the only
person that I know

556
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,310
that knows anything about
this caped crusader stuff.

557
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,170
- That's Batman.
- What?

558
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,840
Forget it.

559
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,840
Can l...

560
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,920
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

561
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,430
On... on, my God!

562
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,770
It's crazy, right?

563
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,860
What are your superpowers?

564
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,920
Superpowers? Dude, I don't
even know how to pee in this thing.

565
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,740
Okay. Can you fly?

566
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:11,910
Okay!

567
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,240
Let's do this.

568
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,780
How do we do this?

569
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,040
Just, um, like, Superman it.

570
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,170
Oh, my God. Obviously,
you have to jump.

571
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,250
Come on.

572
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,210
How is any of this obvious?

573
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,380
Okay.

574
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,800
Try, uh, to believe
that you can fly. Okay?

575
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,220
I read this deep dive

576
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,900
into peer-reviewed
studies about superpowers

577
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,850
and in six out of
ten, belief is the key.

578
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,390
Belief. Belief. Belief. Okay.
Okay. I believe I can fly.

579
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,230
I believe I...

580
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,020
I believe I can fly.

581
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,270
I believe...

582
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,320
Whoa!

583
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,160
Did you believe?

584
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Yeah.

585
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,040
You wanna try invisibility?

586
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,750
How do I do...

587
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,370
Forget it. You know, okay.

588
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,170
Okay, okay, okay.

589
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,260
Oh, my God! It worked!

590
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,840
Where'd you go?

591
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,450
I'm right here.
You can't see me?

592
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,600
Where?

593
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,010
I'm invisible!

594
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,180
I'm right here. Over here.

595
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,650
I'm invisible! I'm invisible!

596
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:25,730
Hey!

597
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,190
Nice outfit, dipshit.

598
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,490
I might've been
testing invisibility

599
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,530
and super-intelligence
at the same time.

600
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,820
Freeman, I'm gonna come
over there and beat you.

601
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,920
Oh, my God! The
lightning emblem!

602
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,380
It was staring us right in
the face the whole time.

603
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,590
Literally!

604
00:41:58,890 --> 00:41:59,890
Okay, okay.

605
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,700
Clearly, we gotta give you a
lightning-themed superhero name.

606
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,890
Yeah.

607
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,190
Oh, right.

608
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,240
Hey, yo! Back...

609
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,280
off.

610
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,240
Hyper-speed, check.

611
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,330
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

612
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,020
I thought you were the
one who was screaming.

613
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,280
I doused him with pepper spray.

614
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,840
Smart move.

615
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,550
Yeah, hey, Mr. Mugger Guy.
Give the old lady her purse back.

616
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,010
I'm your age.

617
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,850
And he didn't get a chance to
take it 'cause I didn't let him take it.

618
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,600
Good. Yeah, good. You're
really on top of this stuff.

619
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,560
And that should teach
you that old ladies...

620
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,600
Regular-aged ladies like yourself
don't need your protecting, right?

621
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,940
So get woke, bro.

622
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,400
I'm sorry, who are you?

623
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,360
His name is Thundercrack,

624
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,110
hero to the people with all the
power and speed of lightning all in one.

625
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,630
Dude, that sounds
like a butt thing.

626
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,700
Mister Philadelphia.

627
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,140
That's a cream
cheese thing, dude!

628
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,590
Power Boy. 'Cause
he's got all the powers.

629
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:06,200
'Cause sometimes pepper
spray can't protect against evil.

630
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,620
Power Boy, do
you know this child?

631
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,920
Like a teeny little bit.
I don't really know...

632
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,680
Yeah. He's like a little
miniature manager.

633
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,720
I'm his manager.

634
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,360
But Power Boy's not gonna work,
either, okay? So work on something else.

635
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,850
Hey, bud, what could...

636
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,980
Electricity manipulation,
hyper-speed, super-strength.

637
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,270
Dude, you're stacked!

638
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:33,190
You're almost as cool
as Superman. Almost.

639
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,380
I didn't see you. I don't know
what just happened here.

640
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,360
I don't wanna know.
Just don't hurt me.

641
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,050
- I'm not doing it for the money.
- Thank you for your kind donation.

642
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,510
No, no, no, but if you
ever need any more help

643
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:43,620
just look for the
superhero that still can't fly.

644
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,580
Forget flying, man.
We just made 73 bucks!

645
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,290
Seventy-three bucks?

646
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,960
Come on!

647
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,040
Hey, wait a minute.

648
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,130
I just got an idea.

649
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,840
I'd like to purchase some
of your finest beer, please.

650
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,590
I don't know about this. I mean,
we don't have a fake ID even.

651
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:21,490
Freddy, Freddy, would you relax?

652
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:24,320
Look at me. I am the fake ID.

653
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:25,510
Everything from the register!

654
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,330
Go, go! Now!

655
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:29,290
Come on! We don't have
any time. Let's go. Move!

656
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,210
We want it all! Hurry.

657
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,540
This is your chance.

658
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,670
Oh! Okay.

659
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:38,170
Come on, come on,
come on! Let's do this!

660
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:40,050
That's it. That's it.

661
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:42,930
Gentlemen,

662
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,760
why use guns when we
can handle this like real men?

663
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,560
Billy, look out!

664
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:04,820
Bullet immunity. You
have bullet immunity!

665
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,370
I'm bulletproof.

666
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:10,290
Today is December 8th,

667
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:12,660
and this is video
proof of authenticity.

668
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,000
Shoot him again.

669
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,130
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here, here. Go. Both of you!

670
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:18,500
Come on. Go to town.

671
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,600
Wait, wait, wait.

672
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,720
We still don't know if
the suit is bulletproof,

673
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,350
or if you are.

674
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:32,390
Shoot him in the face.

675
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,310
Shoot me in the
face. In the face?

676
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,320
It kinda tickles.

677
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:45,910
You're dead.

678
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,310
- Sorry about your window.
- Have a good night!

679
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:55,080
But you're welcome
for not getting robbed!

680
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:58,790
Come on! Let's get outta here.

681
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,170
Hey.

682
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:02,050
- To fighting bad guys.
- Yeah.

683
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,090
Bleh!

684
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,090
Ugh!

685
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,800
That tastes like actual vomit.

686
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,850
Hey, do you know habanero jerky,

687
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:15,730
if you eat enough of it, it can
burn a hole in your stomach?

688
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:16,900
Worth it.

689
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,860
Yeah. Probably not you, though.
You've probably got stomach superpowers.

690
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,360
Probably. Oh, hey.

691
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,570
What's up? I'm a superhero.

692
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,280
Yeah, his name is, uh,

693
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,820
Captain Sparklefingers.

694
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,030
No, it's not. No, it's
not! That's not my name.

695
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:30,490
Hey, we should hang out.
We're, like, the same age.

696
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,160
Oh, okay. I'm out.

697
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,450
Hey, wait up!

698
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,550
I mean, it's a pretty sick view.

699
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:45,720
I totally get why Rocky was
training so hard to get up here.

700
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:50,390
You know, I like you
like this. This is so cool.

701
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:53,060
I mean, no offense,

702
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:57,730
but, like, at first you were kinda
like the opposite of how Darla is.

703
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,520
A dick?

704
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,900
Your words. Not mine.

705
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,400
But yeah.

706
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,590
All right, well, I feel
like every criminal

707
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:09,610
is either on drugs
or asleep by now.

708
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,990
Wanna head home?

709
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,410
Looking like this?

710
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:14,370
Well, yeah,

711
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:17,830
I mean, usually, we'd
have a lair to go back to,

712
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,290
but that's long-term.

713
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,500
Right now, we have a bunk bed.

714
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,180
Just scares me thinking
of him out there all alone.

715
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,180
This is what he does, Rosa.

716
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:36,930
Difference is, when they find him,
we'll be the first to take him back.

717
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,350
With open arms.

718
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,020
Didn't even make it two
days. Not even two days.

719
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,320
Baby, we did our fair share
of running off back when.

720
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,030
At least I did.

721
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,030
- Yeah.
- Even Mary did it.

722
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:52,410
Hmm? Twice.

723
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:56,330
That second time she ran off,

724
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:58,660
you said something
to me I'll never forget.

725
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,500
You said,

726
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,830
"It's not a home until
you call it a home.

727
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,630
It's something you choose."

728
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:10,300
All we can do is give
him a place full of love.

729
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:14,350
Whether he chooses to call
it a home, that's up to him.

730
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:17,810
Yeah.

731
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,920
You gonna help
me with this tree?

732
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,190
This tree's so sad.

733
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,730
Hello?

734
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,360
Got lost finding the bathroom.

735
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,700
Oh, okay, Freddy,
sweetie. Good night.

736
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,780
- Good night.
- Night.

737
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,410
Freddy, who is that?

738
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,410
It's Billy. He's just really
tired and he has laryngitis.

739
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,620
What? Laryngitis!

740
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:41,850
I'm just kidding!
I'm just kidding.

741
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:43,390
He's really, really tired, and
he wants to go to beddy-bye.

742
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,710
- Beddy-bye? Who says beddy-bye?
- Just hide, hide.

743
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,250
Billy, you're back.
Let us see you.

744
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,660
We've been so worried about you.

745
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,430
I told you this was a bad idea!

746
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:54,050
Freddy?

747
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,500
Freddy, what
happened to the stairs?

748
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:58,390
Mmm!

749
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:00,280
Hey! Covering her mouth
like you're gonna kidnap her

750
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:01,910
is not gonna make
her less scared, okay?

751
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,900
Darla, it's me. It's Billy. I
know I don't look like me.

752
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,670
- A wizard made me look like this.
- Maybe don't start with "wizard."

753
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:10,090
It's just gonna make
her more confused.

754
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:13,200
Some old guy brought me to a
temple and he made me say, "Shazam."

755
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:16,030
Rosa!

756
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,040
Verbally triggered
body-manipulation properties!

757
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,520
You can switch by
saying, "Shazam."

758
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:25,580
Baby, was that
you? Are you okay?

759
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:26,790
Uh...

760
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:29,090
I was screwing in a bulb.

761
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,590
Listen to me, Darla. You cannot
tell anybody about this, all right?

762
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,760
But it's Billy. He's a hero.

763
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,240
Yeah, but if a supervillain
finds out that he's a hero,

764
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:37,510
that endangers us, okay?

765
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,810
A hero's loved ones are
the perfect bad guy target.

766
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:42,410
I mean, is she even
good at keeping secrets?

767
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:44,020
- Moderate.
- No.

768
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,100
Oh, God.

769
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,350
Okay, listen, D,

770
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,070
you cannot tell a single soul
about this, all right? Please?

771
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:51,780
Why? What if it's
people we trust?

772
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,820
Because good sisters
don't tell secrets.

773
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,410
- I'm a good sister.
- Yeah, you are.

774
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,220
You know what'd make
you an even better sister?

775
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,430
Is if you fixed the
doorknob for us, okay?

776
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:03,450
Yeah.

777
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,500
- Sweet dreams.
- Sweet dreams. Bye.

778
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,100
- See you in the morning.
- Good night.

779
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:14,380
Hello, sir. How may I help you?

780
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,800
Hi. Sir?

781
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:19,140
Sir, you can't go in
there. Excuse me!

782
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,260
You cannot go in there!

783
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,480
Sorry I'm late.

784
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,940
Thad, this is for
board members only.

785
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,400
I'm aware of that, Father.

786
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,660
Now, that night in the car.

787
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:43,370
I swore to you I saw something,
but you never believed me.

788
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:46,660
So much easier to
blame me, wasn't it?

789
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,790
And say that if I hadn't
screamed that night,

790
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,290
you'd still have your legs.

791
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,760
Well, now I have proof.

792
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,890
That's enough, Thad.

793
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:01,800
Dear Sid, you think?

794
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:07,270
You know, even before the
accident, you belittled me.

795
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,770
Don't make me throw
you outta here, Thad.

796
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,570
You don't need to make a scene.

797
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,110
Oh, brother,

798
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:16,610
the scene has only just begun.

799
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,870
Ask that if you
can throw me out.

800
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,080
What?

801
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,700
Ask the ball if you're man enough
to throw me out of this room.

802
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,460
Let me spoil it for you.

803
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:43,300
Outlook not so good.

804
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,890
I've come here during the
season of giving to give you...

805
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,360
what you deserve.

806
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,960
Run!

807
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,880
Oh, my God! No!

808
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,130
No! No!

809
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,810
Help!

810
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,650
Somebody!

811
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,400
Help me!

812
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,610
You can't go crying to
other people all the time.

813
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:25,570
What sin best befits
you, Father? Hmm?

814
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,780
I'll give you anything.

815
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:29,950
Money.

816
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,620
The company. You
want the company?

817
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:33,500
There it is.

818
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:36,500
Greed.

819
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:38,670
Do you honestly think

820
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,670
all this material
you've accumulated

821
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,180
amounts to actual power?

822
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,520
This is power.

823
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,810
More than you ever had.

824
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,560
More than anyone has.

825
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,320
There is one more powerful.

826
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,780
The wizard found his champion.

827
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:13,500
Kill the champion before
he learns his true potential,

828
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,710
or he will defeat you.

829
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:18,670
Show me where to find him.

830
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,140
Oh, Greed,

831
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:38,190
you can have him.

832
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,480
No.

833
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:43,570
No.. Oh, no!

834
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:47,910
No! No! No!

835
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,840
Family is more than just a word.

836
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:14,140
At Sivana Industries,
our focus is family.

837
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,250
Uh, Burke.

838
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,210
Where's the truck?

839
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,310
I can hear it.

840
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:06,280
Oh, my God!

841
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,900
My truck!

842
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,450
- My truck!
- Are you kidding?

843
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:11,950
You know, guys,

844
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,490
I don't think that's
gonna buff out.

845
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:24,210
Hey.

846
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:26,800
Making the crippled kid
do the dirty work. Wow!

847
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,920
I'm a better lookout.
I can play innocent.

848
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,260
And I can't?

849
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:34,970
Your face gives off a very strong vibe
of someone who's hatching schemes.

850
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:37,470
- My face? This face?
- Yeah. Yeah.

851
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,560
Okay.

852
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,940
You boys got a hall pass?

853
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,030
Oh, us? Yeah. Always.

854
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:50,900
You!

855
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:55,240
You look like you're
up to something.

856
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,700
Me? Up to something?

857
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,830
No. Never am I up to something.

858
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:02,080
Our dad's picking us up.
He got held up at the...

859
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,000
The business office.

860
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,630
The business office, huh?

861
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,460
Sure, kid.

862
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:09,630
Look, parents or guardians

863
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:12,970
must appear physically
to check out students.

864
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,180
Gotcha.

865
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,180
Okay, well, you hear that, Dad?

866
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,640
- Hey!
- Shazam!

867
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,560
Well, hey there, son,

868
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,390
and hey there, other
son that I also have

869
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,540
that's related to that son I
just passed in the hallway.

870
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:28,940
I'm so sorry I'm late. I got
held up at the business office,

871
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,150
doing all the work stuff.

872
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,030
This is the security guard
all the kids admire so much.

873
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,160
Oh.

874
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,040
Actually, that's the other
one. This one sucks.

875
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,290
That's not funny.

876
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:43,460
I'm gonna talk to him
about that. I apologize.

877
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:46,380
Anyway, this is me appearing
physically to check my sons out of school.

878
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:50,840
So, thank you so much for
keeping 'em safe, Detective Moron.

879
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,050
It's Moran.

880
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,760
- You ready?
- Algebra!

881
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:00,310
Science!

882
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,390
English!

883
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,940
Health!

884
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:18,910
Oh. Oh.

885
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:39,800
Are you okay?

886
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,430
I'm sorry!

887
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:44,410
More powerful than a locomotive.

888
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,870
Locomotive. What are
you? An old prospector?

889
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:50,120
Can leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

890
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:55,250
Single bound.

891
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,470
Oh!

892
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:00,720
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

893
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,930
I'm sorry, people. Hi.

894
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:03,180
- Your phone's charged.
- Wow!

895
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:04,890
Your phone's charged.

896
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:06,100
Your phone's charged.

897
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:09,560
You really need like a mic drop
catchphrase after you do some cool shit.

898
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,020
I've been thinking about that.

899
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,440
What about this?

900
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:15,190
"That's why you don't
mess with electricity."

901
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,250
Catchphrases obviously
aren't one of your superpowers.

902
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,900
And your phone's charged.

903
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,070
- Well, you think you can do better?
- What the hell?

904
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:23,570
Let there be light.

905
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:29,040
Yeah, yeah, baby.
Yeah, baby, okay.

906
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:35,670
How do I... Never mind.

907
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:36,750
Shazam!

908
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:41,680
Shazam!

909
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,620
What'd you see? What'd
you see? Were there boobies?

910
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,690
You see nipples?
Why aren't you talking?

911
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,500
We're gonna need more money.

912
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:59,000
Why? You were in there
for, like, five minutes.

913
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,530
Dude, they were very convincing!

914
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:06,910
Oh, get it, get it!

915
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:09,870
Go, go, go!

916
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:16,880
No!

917
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:19,050
Stop! No!

918
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:20,230
- I'm not even looking!
- Stop!

919
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,550
- I'm not even looking! Oh!
- Stop!

920
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:24,430
- Why?
- Oh, and done!

921
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:25,930
Finished him.

922
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:31,350
A lair.

923
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:32,560
Yes.

924
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,700
And obviously,
we're gonna have to

925
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:35,490
- be making this purchase anonymously.
- Mmm.

926
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,060
Obviously.

927
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:40,070
And, um, if you have
a location on a cliff.

928
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:41,780
Like a castle-esque type thing.

929
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,590
- Overlooking some water.
- Overlooking some water,

930
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:45,360
seas, below it.
Rough, you know...

931
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:46,660
Like a waterfall,

932
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:49,090
- so you can drive into...
- Waterfall, yeah. If you... Yeah.

933
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,580
Look, Maximum Voltage, is it?

934
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,750
You can call me Max.

935
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:57,290
Look, Max, why don't you just start with
how many bedrooms you're looking for?

936
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,540
- One!
- Seven.

937
01:01:58,630 --> 01:01:59,800
- One?
- Seven?

938
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,360
What, am I running
a foster home now?

939
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,450
Have you seen the one where
he throws the football into space?

940
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,480
So dope.

941
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,520
Hey, you guys gotta wonder
who's filming those, right?

942
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,860
I mean, that's
bravery in and of itself.

943
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:22,150
I mean, is it, though?

944
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,530
Yeah. I'd actually argue
maybe even more brave.

945
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:25,610
Holding a camera?

946
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:28,620
Staring in the face of danger.

947
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:30,080
Like some weirdo fanboy.

948
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:32,870
Hey, Freeman.

949
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:34,910
I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

950
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
What, is your bestie gonna hit
us with a wheelchair this time?

951
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,560
No, maybe not him, but I
have another best friend

952
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,470
who might hunt you down
and destroy both of you.

953
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:43,260
Okay, Freddy.

954
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:46,590
You may have heard of him.
The Human Power Storm.

955
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,930
Frequency Flinger.
Sir Zaps-A-Lot.

956
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:50,760
Yeah. He's a man of many names.

957
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,010
You know the Red Cyclone?

958
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,850
You? My ass you do.

959
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:56,770
Oh, we're a lot
closer than you think.

960
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:58,810
Maybe even at this very moment.

961
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,110
Prove it.

962
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:03,030
I will, tomorrow. Tomorrow
he's gonna come to lunch.

963
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:04,490
Right, right, Billy?

964
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:07,170
Oh, yeah, and then Superman's
gonna be bringing us dessert, right?

965
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,780
Tomorrow at lunch. You'll see.

966
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:15,500
And when he doesn't show,
then we'll kick your ass.

967
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:21,590
So, wait, my identity's a secret
so no one I know can get hurt.

968
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:25,130
Except when it makes you
look cool, then it's all good.

969
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:26,730
Billy, it's not like
they're supervillains.

970
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,760
They're just super douchebags.

971
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,180
So, you're breaking
your own rule?

972
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:32,260
Got it.

973
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,720
This thing is as much
as mine as it is yours.

974
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:39,480
Starting to think you
think it's all your thing.

975
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,860
Billy, you're still gonna
do it, though, right?

976
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,940
I mean, what would
a good brother do?

977
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:47,030
All hands on deck.

978
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:53,530
Thank you for this family.
Thank you for this day.

979
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:57,000
Thank you for this food.
Sorry Billy's hand's on vacay.

980
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,460
Big news in Philly.
Got a costumed hero.

981
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,050
He's doing good.

982
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:06,670
Yeah, but is he, though?

983
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:10,260
Ooh! Controversy. Into it.

984
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:13,720
Share with us your
perspective, Eugene.

985
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,680
Just saying, he's what?
Charging people's phones?

986
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,600
So what? I can charge
a phone with a plug.

987
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:20,690
Preach.

988
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,610
Pedro, any thoughts?

989
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:26,150
Costume's stupid.

990
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,530
- Yeah.
- Okay.

991
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:29,740
Big white cape like he's
getting married or something.

992
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:32,070
What if he didn't get
to pick his costume?

993
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,320
Ever think about that?

994
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:36,250
You're a specialist,
Freddy. What do you think?

995
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:40,330
Yeah, Freddy, let's
manage to see the positive.

996
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,330
Okay, Well, I
think it looks like

997
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,420
he doesn't have gratitude
for what he's been given.

998
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:47,090
Very specific. All right.

999
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:48,420
Maybe to the superhero,

1000
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,190
gratitude doesn't mean
having to be clingy.

1001
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:51,630
Clingy? Wow, interesting take.

1002
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:55,970
You know, maybe sometimes a
superhero just wants a little me time.

1003
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:59,180
You know, me time could also be
construed as pushing away his family.

1004
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:01,230
Family. Is that
what they are now?

1005
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:03,400
It's a classic symptom
of "Superhero Syndrome."

1006
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:07,020
Coined by German psychologist
Heinrich Von German-something,

1007
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:10,280
where superpowers become
an all-consuming narcotic.

1008
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:13,570
Son, we're still eating dinner.

1009
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,410
What he needs is a sidekick.

1010
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:17,030
Name one cool sidekick.

1011
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,370
Darla, why are you so
quiet over there, baby?

1012
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:22,540
You're never at
a loss for words.

1013
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,210
I'm eating.

1014
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:36,640
Why am I still doing this?

1015
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:38,930
Well, you can't skip every day.

1016
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,770
Not at your age.

1017
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,100
But I'm not your age anymore.

1018
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:45,100
But I can go with you.

1019
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:47,770
We just gotta trick the
guard out, you know?

1020
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,730
Billy, where are you going?

1021
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,210
You're still gonna have
lunch with me, right?

1022
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,240
Billy!

1023
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:56,120
Sir Zaps-A-Lot's still gonna
eat in the cafeteria, right?

1024
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,540
All right.

1025
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,460
Did you check it to...

1026
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:13,260
People typically give me
a little money, you know...

1027
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,550
You're a sweet couple.
You guys have a good day.

1028
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:27,480
Ooh!

1029
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,940
- Oh, my God.
- Mary, are you okay?

1030
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,480
How do you know my name?

1031
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:33,650
Uh... How do I know
your name? Uh...

1032
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:36,860
One of my superpowers
is name guessing.

1033
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,320
Which is really weird, I bet.

1034
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:41,950
Uh, it's not as cool as
super-strength or super-speed,

1035
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,160
but it's really helpful
when I meet new people.

1036
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:45,790
Are you hurt?

1037
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:50,000
No, I'm okay. Thank you. Um...

1038
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,420
I just need a second to think.

1039
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,050
This has been such a weird day.

1040
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,430
Um, using my powers
of super-observation,

1041
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:03,930
I see that you're holding a
letter from a college in your hand.

1042
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,600
Are you upset because
you didn't get in?

1043
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:11,150
I got in.

1044
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:17,860
Well, now my superpowers are
failing me and I am very confused.

1045
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:20,700
Yeah. Me, too.

1046
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,180
I don't know. I know
I should be excited

1047
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,410
'cause this is my dream and I've
worked really, really hard for this,

1048
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:28,420
but it's like...

1049
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,590
I don't know. Leaving my family
does not feel fun, you know?

1050
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:36,760
Could I give you a
little piece of advice?

1051
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:40,550
Don't be worried about everybody
else. Always look out for number one.

1052
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,640
Gandhi said that.

1053
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,510
- I don't think he said that.
- Yeah, he did.

1054
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,370
- Gandhi did not say...
- Somebody like Gandhi said that.

1055
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:46,270
"Take care of number one."

1056
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:48,440
It was a really wise...
It might've been Yoda.

1057
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,600
- Listen.
- I'm sorry, no.

1058
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:52,730
Agree to disagree. The point
is, you do you, you know?

1059
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:56,280
You gotta look out for you. And get
as far away from this place as you can.

1060
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,200
I don't know if I want to.

1061
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,870
Of course you do.
What're you gonna do?

1062
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:04,190
You gonna live in a group
home for the rest of your life?

1063
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:06,660
Look, families are for people

1064
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:09,370
who can't take care of
themselves, okay? So...

1065
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:12,830
And you can take
care of yourself.

1066
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,880
Also, look both ways
when you cross the street.

1067
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,970
I'll just call him.
I'll just make sure.

1068
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:26,600
It's ringing.

1069
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,140
Red Cyclone, hey!
Hey, what's going on?

1070
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,580
Oh, that's crazy! Yeah,
it's Freddy, by the way.

1071
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,980
Yeah, it's crazy! Great story.

1072
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,070
He's not talking to anyone.

1073
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:40,990
I was!

1074
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:43,700
I was! We're friends.
I know him, I do!

1075
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:45,700
I know him! I know
him! Uh, yeah.

1076
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:50,620
Shit.

1077
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,250
Come on now.

1078
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:59,510
Hands! Lightning with my hands!

1079
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:01,680
Lightning with my hands!

1080
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,720
Lightning with my hands!

1081
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,100
Hey. Hey.

1082
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,760
Hey, young man! Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

1083
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:09,780
What are you doing? I'm in
the middle of a show right now.

1084
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:11,020
How can I help you?

1085
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,500
I just wanted to say thank you
for showing up to lunch today.

1086
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:17,270
Yeah, I got a little something
called a, uh, suitcase wedgie, right?

1087
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,190
I don't know if you've
ever heard of it,

1088
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:21,360
but it's when someone
grabs your underwear like that

1089
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:24,160
and holds you like a suitcase,
walks you down the hallway.

1090
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:26,490
And this was my underwear.

1091
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:30,330
Gross.

1092
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:32,250
You said you'd come.

1093
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:34,420
You said I would come!
I never said I was...

1094
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:35,920
I'm a superhero, dude!

1095
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,710
Well, you're acting real heroic.

1096
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:39,210
How much people
paying you today?

1097
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,590
Listen, I have serious
responsibilities now, okay?

1098
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:45,050
But that's cool because I
can carry that burden with my...

1099
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:47,760
Hands! Lightning with my hands!

1100
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:08,410
Oh, man!

1101
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:15,000
Holy moly.

1102
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:20,250
Don't move! Nobody move!

1103
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,890
Oh, no, no!

1104
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:33,480
Oh, no, no, no!
Stay, stay! Stay!

1105
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:42,940
Oh!

1106
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:44,690
Oh, that looked like it hurt.

1107
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:47,780
It's him! It's that
superhero guy!

1108
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:50,530
Help us! Save us!

1109
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,120
Come on!

1110
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,290
Come on... Yeah.

1111
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:58,960
What's he doing?
What's going on?

1112
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:08,760
No way.

1113
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,600
Oh, no, no. Please
don't make me do this.

1114
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,840
God, this is the
worst idea ever!

1115
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:34,370
I did it! I did it!

1116
01:11:34,450 --> 01:11:36,660
I got the bus! I got the bus.

1117
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,460
Nobody move in there.

1118
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:40,940
Oh, I gotta put this thing
down. I gotta put this thing down.

1119
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,090
Oh!

1120
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:46,210
Oh.

1121
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,280
Oh, no, no, no, no. Doggy,
doggy, you have to move.

1122
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,090
Move! Move! Shoo! Shoo!

1123
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,010
Please be a good dog, good dog!

1124
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,510
You're being a bad dog!

1125
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,140
Go! Go!

1126
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,560
Please go. Please move.

1127
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,770
Yes, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1128
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:02,690
Thank you.

1129
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:21,250
Yeah. Yeah, no, no, no, no.

1130
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:23,270
I was in the neighborhood,
you know, so I thought...

1131
01:12:23,290 --> 01:12:24,380
Thank you!

1132
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,250
It was kind of my fault anyway.

1133
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:32,890
So, it seems Philadelphia has
gotten an early Christmas present

1134
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:36,770
in the form of its
very own superhero.

1135
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:38,100
And we're out.

1136
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:40,540
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, of course, yeah.

1137
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,360
Dude! Dude, dude!
Dude, did you see that?

1138
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,530
Yeah. You electrocuted a bus
and almost killed these people.

1139
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:48,280
And then I caught it!

1140
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:51,950
Freddy, I caught a bus
with my bare hands, man!

1141
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:53,950
I caught a bus like
people catch fly balls.

1142
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:55,410
Like, who does that? I do that!

1143
01:12:55,490 --> 01:12:56,870
Billy! You do nothing.

1144
01:12:56,950 --> 01:13:00,410
You take selfies and
make people pay you.

1145
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,790
You know, forget it. I can't really
talk to you when you look like this.

1146
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,590
You just wish it was you.

1147
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:07,210
No shit!

1148
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:11,590
You think? I would kill
to have what you have.

1149
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,720
Because everything
I do is, like,

1150
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,600
some desperate attempt
to get people to notice me.

1151
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,720
To not feel sorry for me.

1152
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:21,520
I mean, look at me! Look
at me. Do you even see me?

1153
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:25,940
'Cause most people don't.
'Cause they don't want to.

1154
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:28,230
And now you don't either.

1155
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:31,070
I mean, you think
this is who you are?

1156
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:32,700
I mean, Billy, you're 14,

1157
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:34,860
and now you're no
better than the Breyers.

1158
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:39,580
All this power, and all you did
was turn into a show-off and a bully.

1159
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:43,620
Whatever, kid!

1160
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:45,000
I do what I want!

1161
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,300
And I'm, like, mid-20s probably!

1162
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:52,090
Maybe even, like, 30.

1163
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:56,680
Chosen one.

1164
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,560
The so-called perfect man.

1165
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:05,270
Pure of heart.

1166
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,230
Flawless in every way.

1167
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:12,400
What made you so worthy?

1168
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:14,860
I'm sorry, can I help...

1169
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,260
Do you want an
autograph or something?

1170
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,910
Give me your power.

1171
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:21,540
Or die.

1172
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:24,960
Oh, snap! You're,
like, a bad guy, right?

1173
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:28,290
Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Before
this gets really stupid for you,

1174
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,460
you should know that
I'm basically invincible.

1175
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:41,810
The weapons of man
draw no blood from our kind.

1176
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:43,930
I said, stop right there!

1177
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,190
The only thing that
extinguishes magic...

1178
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,560
is magic.

1179
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:52,280
Time to transfer
your power to me.

1180
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:58,450
Oh, you did not see that
one coming, did you, grandpa?

1181
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:00,450
Them's street rules.

1182
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:11,290
Okay, okay, okay.

1183
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:13,170
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1184
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,270
I never should've punched
you in the nuts like that.

1185
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:16,340
That was totally my bad.

1186
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:17,630
We can talk about this.

1187
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,220
You grovel like a child.

1188
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,350
That's because I
am one. I'm a kid!

1189
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:22,850
You don't wanna
hurt a kid, do you?

1190
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:28,980
I believe I can fly! I
believe I can fly, I can fly!

1191
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,750
Freddy said if I believe
I can fly, then I can fly.

1192
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:32,650
So I believe! I
believe! I believe!

1193
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:33,610
Okay.

1194
01:15:33,690 --> 01:15:34,780
Superman!

1195
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,610
Superman! What arm is it?

1196
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,700
Why am I not flying?

1197
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:40,280
Please, I don't wanna die!

1198
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,430
I'm floating!

1199
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:12,940
What the hell was that?

1200
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:19,150
I can fly!

1201
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,160
Billy?

1202
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,250
Freddy! I need your help!

1203
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:31,120
You can fly?

1204
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:40,220
Who's the other guy?

1205
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:41,840
Santa!

1206
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:48,980
So, like, what do you and Mrs.
Claus do in the summertime?

1207
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:51,560
Well, in some ways,

1208
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,440
Santa is always here for you.

1209
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,320
Help Santa!

1210
01:17:02,110 --> 01:17:04,820
Santa needs help! Help!

1211
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:06,370
Give us a shout if you need us.

1212
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:16,040
I'm just gonna chill in here
for a little while, if that's okay.

1213
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:21,050
This is crazy.

1214
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:22,610
This is crazy. You don't
have to fight this guy.

1215
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:24,760
This isn't your job.
You can run, right?

1216
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,970
Yes, you can run. Awesome!

1217
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:37,020
Get back!

1218
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:38,530
Get away!

1219
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,530
- I'm Batman!
- Get him, Batman!

1220
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,490
Oh, sorry.

1221
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,690
Come on!

1222
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:41,000
Shazam!

1223
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:12,410
Billy!

1224
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:14,830
Billy!

1225
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,620
Billy, where are you?

1226
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:21,750
Billy!

1227
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,260
Where are you, Billy?

1228
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,220
Billy, come on!

1229
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:36,140
Billy. Where is he?

1230
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,600
Supervillain.

1231
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:40,360
Supervillain! Supervillain!

1232
01:19:41,230 --> 01:19:43,520
Worse. Much worse.

1233
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,820
Radioactive anthromorph?
Psychic energy manipulator?

1234
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:51,070
I won't let you read my mind.
My mind is blank. You can't get in.

1235
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:54,870
I don't need to read your mind.
Because you are going to tell me.

1236
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,410
Where is he?

1237
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,300
Oh, my God, honey, are you okay?

1238
01:20:12,010 --> 01:20:13,970
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1239
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,640
What happened? Are you hurt?

1240
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,560
Come inside.

1241
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,930
We need to have a talk.

1242
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:21,100
Just don't be so
hard on him, okay?

1243
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:29,780
Running out on us! Lying!

1244
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:33,530
Huh? Then I get a call from the school,
telling me you've been cutting class!

1245
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,740
Getting in fights!

1246
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,000
Bill, the man saved nine people.

1247
01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:43,170
Whoa! Is that...

1248
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:45,290
I'm questioning his motive.

1249
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:47,710
What's Freddy doing
with a superhero?

1250
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:54,260
Or what's a superhero
doing with Freddy?

1251
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:59,060
You remember dinner,

1252
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:03,150
when Billy and Freddy were arguing
like an old married couple, like this?

1253
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,820
When he rescued me, he
knew I lived in a group home.

1254
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,860
He knew my name.
He called me Mary.

1255
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:21,040
Wait, are you saying Billy's
the Human Power Storm?

1256
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,920
Yes! You guys figured it out!

1257
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,460
All on your own. I didn't help.

1258
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:26,590
- I didn't break any promises.
- You knew?

1259
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:28,710
I'm a good sister!

1260
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:34,590
I mean, what were you thinking?

1261
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:37,310
And then you
bring Freddy into it.

1262
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:46,230
Give him some space,
guys. He's a little upset, okay?

1263
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,280
Billy?

1264
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:03,750
You're him.

1265
01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:06,170
You're the hero.

1266
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:09,210
Yeah, well, not anymore, so...

1267
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:16,550
Why do you have my notebook?

1268
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,140
Eugene finished your search.

1269
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,600
Look, I'm not a hacker, okay?

1270
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:26,020
But I have played
Watch Dogs and Uplink.

1271
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:29,190
And maybe I did pick up a few
skills, which maybe did get me

1272
01:22:29,270 --> 01:22:31,280
into federal databases
most people can't get into.

1273
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,490
Good for you, but I'm gonna go.

1274
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:37,280
Your parents' names are
Marilyn and C.C. Batson.

1275
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:43,700
What?

1276
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:46,040
You were born in
Zumbrota, Minnesota.

1277
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,830
They divorced
when you were three.

1278
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:51,840
Your mom moved here that year.
Twenty months later, you got lost.

1279
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:52,760
You never found them

1280
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,970
'cause your dad's been in
prison in Florida for ten years.

1281
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:57,260
And your mom's...

1282
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,100
What?

1283
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:02,970
Is she dead?

1284
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,230
She's two subway stops away.

1285
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:07,600
What?

1286
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:11,860
You know, you didn't find her because
she reverted to her maiden name.

1287
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,160
Hey, Billy! Billy!

1288
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,510
- Victor, get the keys.
- I got it.

1289
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,790
Kids, stay here in
case Billy comes back.

1290
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:35,300
Come on. Inside, let's go.

1291
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:46,560
Wait. I thought we
were running after Billy.

1292
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:49,350
No, we're gonna
wait here for now.

1293
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:54,320
Billy?

1294
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:57,940
Freddy?

1295
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:04,450
Oh, how quaint.

1296
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:09,250
Actually, I take that back.

1297
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:13,420
What a shithole.

1298
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:57,710
Just a second.

1299
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:04,150
Hey, look, I'm late for
work already, all right?

1300
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:06,890
We don't need any magazines
or whatever. Thanks, though.

1301
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:08,060
Oh, I'm not.

1302
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:11,100
You probably don't
recognize me...

1303
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:14,230
but I found my way home.

1304
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:16,690
Mom.

1305
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:19,780
It's me.

1306
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:22,200
Oh, God.

1307
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:24,610
Is it?

1308
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,580
Um... Hang on.

1309
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:32,120
Who's at the door?

1310
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:34,710
It's, um...

1311
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:37,250
It's no one, Travis.

1312
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,680
That wasn't Dad, was it?

1313
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,050
No.

1314
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:49,270
Listen, um...

1315
01:25:51,310 --> 01:25:52,440
It's really you, huh?

1316
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:58,770
I didn't mean to run
away. You know that, right?

1317
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:02,190
I let go, but it
was by accident.

1318
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:03,990
Yeah, no. I know, yeah.

1319
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:06,200
I saw you.

1320
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:08,490
What?

1321
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:13,290
I saw you after.

1322
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:19,590
So, it was never your fault.

1323
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:24,300
Look, I was 17, okay? And
my daddy kicked me out.

1324
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:28,680
And your dad just decided
not to be a part of anything.

1325
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:32,890
And I was hurting,
and I was screwed up.

1326
01:26:35,310 --> 01:26:36,940
- I want the tiger.
- I know.

1327
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:38,730
I know, honey,

1328
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:41,480
but Mom's not exactly
going pro here, okay?

1329
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:45,320
Billy?

1330
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:46,910
Billy!

1331
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:48,820
Billy?

1332
01:26:49,410 --> 01:26:52,080
Jesus Christ. Billy,
this isn't funny!

1333
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,450
Here you go, buddy.

1334
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:56,670
That should warm
you up. Is that better?

1335
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,760
Look, it's just once I
saw you with the police,

1336
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,970
I realized that they could do

1337
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:07,680
a better job taking care
of you than I ever will.

1338
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:14,680
But you're good, right?

1339
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,690
I mean, you landed on your feet.

1340
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,150
Because, I mean,
you look real good.

1341
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:24,570
It's just...

1342
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:30,160
now is not a really
good time for me, Bill.

1343
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:39,330
All I wanted to do is let
you know I'm doing good,

1344
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:44,090
but I have to get
back to my real family.

1345
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:47,260
Here.

1346
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:51,890
What's this?

1347
01:27:52,890 --> 01:27:55,520
Marilyn! What's
goin' on out there?

1348
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:57,730
You might need it more than me.

1349
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:18,210
Freddy, you were right.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1350
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:21,880
Come home, Billy. Come home.

1351
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,590
- Billy! Supervillain!
- Supervillain!

1352
01:28:41,770 --> 01:28:42,810
Shazam!

1353
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:58,660
Who are you? What do you want?

1354
01:28:59,290 --> 01:29:00,960
What do I want?

1355
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,790
I want...

1356
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,710
That.

1357
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:11,180
Whoa.

1358
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,390
Kick his ass, Billy!

1359
01:29:19,850 --> 01:29:20,940
Yes, Billy.

1360
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,150
Try it, by all means.

1361
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:25,270
Let them go and
I'll come inside.

1362
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,360
No, first, you come inside,

1363
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:28,940
then maybe I'll let them go.

1364
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:47,550
Good boy.

1365
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:52,340
Because that's
all you are, isn't it?

1366
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:54,340
How old are you?

1367
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:56,720
- Basically 15.
- Hmm.

1368
01:29:58,970 --> 01:30:02,640
When I was a child, the old
man told me I wasn't good enough.

1369
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:05,650
Yet here you are, a coward.

1370
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:11,240
Run from me and the wizard
chooses you? You're not a hero.

1371
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,900
But I'm gonna give you
the opportunity to be one.

1372
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:16,700
Give me the power
of the champion.

1373
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:17,990
No. Don't do it, Billy.

1374
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:37,430
Give me the power
and I'll let them go.

1375
01:30:37,510 --> 01:30:38,720
Darla, no.

1376
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:40,390
Don't go, Billy.

1377
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:43,600
- Don't go, Billy.
- Darla, come here.

1378
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,520
No, I have to.

1379
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,440
It's what a good
brother would do. Right?

1380
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:54,530
Billy.

1381
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:23,720
I dedicated my
life to getting here.

1382
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:26,480
I scoured the earth.

1383
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:28,400
No one believed me.

1384
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:31,070
No one helped.

1385
01:31:31,150 --> 01:31:32,570
Not the wizard.

1386
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:34,900
Not my family.

1387
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:38,530
I only had myself.

1388
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,410
I get it.

1389
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:43,370
I get what that's like.

1390
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:47,160
Feeling like you're
all alone in the world.

1391
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:48,250
Stand.

1392
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:51,440
Feeling like there's that one
thing, and if you could just find it,

1393
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:53,420
then you'd finally
be good enough.

1394
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,500
Stand.

1395
01:31:57,300 --> 01:31:58,930
The champion's name.

1396
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:01,470
Say it.

1397
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:30,120
Look, no offense, mister,

1398
01:32:30,210 --> 01:32:32,730
but I don't think these things
have your best interest at heart.

1399
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:36,130
Don't listen to this child.

1400
01:32:36,710 --> 01:32:39,220
Take the staff.

1401
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:43,680
Hold it and say the
champion's name.

1402
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:45,810
They're using you.

1403
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:48,890
You have to see that,
that they are using you.

1404
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:50,100
Say your name.

1405
01:32:53,730 --> 01:32:54,730
His name...

1406
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:57,900
is Captain Sparklefingers.

1407
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:00,150
And we're gonna keep
throwing things at your big,

1408
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:02,200
fat, ugly-eyed head,

1409
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:04,160
until you let our brother go.

1410
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:30,490
Boy, am I glad I didn't
sell that Batarang.

1411
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:33,060
- Pedro, is that a lamp?
- It's an ugly one.

1412
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:34,860
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1413
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:36,170
Guys, I appreciate the thought,

1414
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:38,290
I really do, but I don't think
your weapons are gonna help.

1415
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:39,860
You can put 'em down now.

1416
01:33:41,490 --> 01:33:42,610
The door was right here.

1417
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,110
Billy, how do we get outta here?

1418
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:46,180
What, you think I
know? I don't know.

1419
01:33:46,990 --> 01:33:47,830
This way!

1420
01:33:47,910 --> 01:33:49,410
Go, go, go. Follow Darla.

1421
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,290
Good job, Darla. Go, go, go!

1422
01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:52,370
Kids?

1423
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,040
Why is this open?

1424
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,750
Freddy? Mary?

1425
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:02,840
Pedro, Pedro, come on.

1426
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:04,720
Freddy? Freddy, keep up.

1427
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,090
Darla, stay in front.

1428
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:08,100
We gotta hurry.

1429
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:32,960
Whoa!

1430
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:36,250
So many doors.

1431
01:34:36,330 --> 01:34:39,130
One of these has to
be a way out, right?

1432
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:40,500
Yeah, I would hope so.

1433
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,560
Not this one.

1434
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:14,750
Okay, no more doors.
Nobody open any more doors.

1435
01:35:14,830 --> 01:35:16,750
Come on, Billy. What
are we gonna do?

1436
01:35:16,830 --> 01:35:17,920
Darla, I don't know.

1437
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,500
Yes, you do. Just think.
How'd you get out last time?

1438
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:22,770
Uh, last time, I thought about the
subway, and I was on the subway.

1439
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,720
Okay. Then, Billy, look,
think about the subway.

1440
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,510
Think about any place
except for here, okay?

1441
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:50,870
Come on, come on, come on.

1442
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:52,660
Why are you covering my eyes?

1443
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:55,370
Really? This is the first
place you think of? Wow!

1444
01:35:55,450 --> 01:35:56,540
You're welcome!

1445
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:58,250
Why can't I see what's inside?

1446
01:35:58,330 --> 01:35:59,790
You are not old enough.

1447
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,750
Old enough to know
that was great music.

1448
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:03,540
Not my thing.

1449
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:04,710
Where's Freddy?

1450
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:05,960
Yeah, you, too, Sriracha.

1451
01:36:06,050 --> 01:36:07,760
Hey, have a holly
jolly Christmas.

1452
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,130
Freddy! What are you doing?

1453
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:10,590
Nice people.

1454
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:11,550
Nice people? Come on.

1455
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:13,660
Is that glitter? They have
glitter! Can I get glitter?

1456
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:14,890
No, not from them.

1457
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:16,020
Please?

1458
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:17,100
No..

1459
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:19,980
Darla.

1460
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:26,860
Go, go, go. Everybody, go!

1461
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:28,570
Freddy? Freddy, Freddy.

1462
01:36:28,650 --> 01:36:30,010
One, two, three.
Up, up. Up we go.

1463
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,080
Carnival, go! Go, Mary, go.

1464
01:36:40,170 --> 01:36:41,960
Come on, Pedro. Come on.

1465
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,390
Don't run, but don't
walk. Just be cool.

1466
01:36:55,470 --> 01:36:58,140
Act naturally, like kids
naturally act in a carnival.

1467
01:36:58,230 --> 01:36:59,990
- He's not gonna look for us here.
- Is that him?

1468
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:01,540
- Oh, my God!
- Dude, it's Zap-tain America!

1469
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,520
- Power Boy!
- He's an impersonator, okay?

1470
01:37:03,610 --> 01:37:04,870
Yeah, I'm an impersonator!
I'm a fake version of myself.

1471
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:06,320
Don't take pictures.

1472
01:37:08,530 --> 01:37:09,700
Shazam!

1473
01:37:16,830 --> 01:37:18,370
Hey! Where'd he go?

1474
01:37:18,450 --> 01:37:19,660
What, is he invisible now?

1475
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:29,840
Oh, man, I just spit on a baby!

1476
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:32,880
Yo, what is that?

1477
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:37,680
Who is that guy?

1478
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:40,180
Champion.

1479
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:45,150
You don't deserve that name.

1480
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:49,190
See that? Look at that up there!

1481
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:52,900
Hiding behind innocent
people who will now die.

1482
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:58,290
Because deep down you're
still just a scared little boy.

1483
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,080
Oh, no.

1484
01:38:03,330 --> 01:38:05,960
Run! Run!

1485
01:38:18,890 --> 01:38:21,390
- Oh! What do we do?
- Just hold on!

1486
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:23,140
- To what?
- The bar, you idiot!

1487
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,200
Well, you wanted
me to be a hero.

1488
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:35,320
Are you kidding?

1489
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:39,200
Okay, no. Old guy's up there
harboring multiple spiritual entities.

1490
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,990
Plus, he has the
same powers as you.

1491
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,510
Plus, I mean, he
knows what he's doing.

1492
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:44,940
Plus, I mean, you're my best
friend. I don't want you to die.

1493
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,540
If a superhero
can't save his family,

1494
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:50,920
he's not much of a hero.

1495
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,010
That was a decent catchphrase.

1496
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:59,100
Shazam!

1497
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,900
Now, let's try this again.

1498
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:25,750
Or try that again!

1499
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:35,010
Billy, look out!

1500
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:40,430
Laser eyes! Guys,
he's got laser eyes!

1501
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:42,680
Too bad your aim sucks balls!

1502
01:39:52,570 --> 01:39:53,780
That's his power matrix.

1503
01:39:53,860 --> 01:39:54,860
His what-what?

1504
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:57,900
When the demon guys leave
his eye, he loses his powers.

1505
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:00,240
That's why the
Batarang hurt him.

1506
01:40:01,490 --> 01:40:02,370
Hey!

1507
01:40:02,450 --> 01:40:03,450
Over here!

1508
01:40:04,830 --> 01:40:06,600
- Wait. What are you doing?
- Trust me. Divide and conquer.

1509
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:08,980
We separate the Sins from the
eye, and he's just an old man.

1510
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:10,790
Gather the mutts.

1511
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:25,560
Run!

1512
01:40:31,810 --> 01:40:33,900
Darla, no!

1513
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:50,580
Here. Take it.

1514
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:52,540
Take it. It's for you.

1515
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:54,210
Hold it tight.

1516
01:40:54,290 --> 01:40:57,260
Close your eyes.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1517
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:58,800
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1518
01:40:59,670 --> 01:41:00,800
Okay.

1519
01:41:41,130 --> 01:41:42,260
Shazam!

1520
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:05,990
Shazam!

1521
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:12,580
Playtime's over, boy.

1522
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:15,670
Your friends can't
help you anymore.

1523
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:16,920
Shazam!

1524
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:22,670
Hey!

1525
01:42:49,530 --> 01:42:50,660
Shazam!

1526
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:16,940
Nice trick.

1527
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:18,020
Catchy.

1528
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:20,480
One simple word.

1529
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:22,230
I have a better trick.

1530
01:43:23,190 --> 01:43:24,490
Four words.

1531
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:26,950
Kill the little girl.

1532
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:29,660
- Darla, no!
- Take me instead!

1533
01:43:33,950 --> 01:43:35,000
Stop!

1534
01:43:50,510 --> 01:43:53,260
Billy, there's one more
demon guy in his eye!

1535
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:55,350
You gotta just rip it
out of his face hole!

1536
01:43:55,430 --> 01:43:56,590
It's where he gets his power.

1537
01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:02,320
Reach for it.

1538
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:05,030
I dare you.

1539
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:15,410
Wise decision.

1540
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:19,120
Hands on the staff.

1541
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:22,170
Billy, don't do this. Billy!

1542
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:23,840
- Billy.
- Don't do it, Billy!

1543
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:24,920
Don't!

1544
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:47,900
Say my name so my
power may flow through you.

1545
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:51,110
I open my heart
to you, Billy Batson.

1546
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:55,030
And in so doing,
choose you as champion.

1547
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:59,250
With your heart, unlock
your greatest power.

1548
01:44:59,330 --> 01:45:02,130
The thrones of our
brothers and sisters await.

1549
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:11,760
All hands on deck.

1550
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:18,430
Say my name.

1551
01:45:19,810 --> 01:45:21,190
Billy!

1552
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:22,270
No, not my name.

1553
01:45:22,350 --> 01:45:24,150
Say the name that I
say to turn into this guy.

1554
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:26,360
Shazam!

1555
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:06,150
Guys.

1556
01:46:08,150 --> 01:46:09,150
What's happening?

1557
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:14,700
I can fly!

1558
01:46:19,830 --> 01:46:21,200
Guys.

1559
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:23,330
Check out these guns.

1560
01:46:24,290 --> 01:46:27,290
No. It's not possible.

1561
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:32,260
Gee-whiz, mister.
Sorry I took your cane.

1562
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:33,510
Do you want it back?

1563
01:46:36,180 --> 01:46:37,640
Guys, I don't
believe in violence,

1564
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:41,520
but I think we should kick
this guy's butt, like, really hard.

1565
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:47,560
Whoa!

1566
01:46:53,190 --> 01:46:54,590
Guys, I think I
can move really...

1567
01:46:55,530 --> 01:46:56,530
fast.

1568
01:46:57,240 --> 01:46:59,240
Hyper-speed! Check!

1569
01:47:08,330 --> 01:47:10,800
Billy! The eye!

1570
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:19,680
Look out!

1571
01:47:21,890 --> 01:47:22,890
Whoa!

1572
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:26,690
What?

1573
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:29,020
- What!
- Dude!

1574
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:31,020
You almost exploded me.

1575
01:48:17,030 --> 01:48:18,950
Dude, I've studied
the fighting techniques

1576
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:20,490
of every single superhero.

1577
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:23,530
What do you got?

1578
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:28,410
Well, that's terrifying.

1579
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:04,370
Enough games, boy.

1580
01:49:05,410 --> 01:49:06,870
You think a pack
of children can...

1581
01:49:10,290 --> 01:49:11,370
Wait, what?

1582
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:13,750
You will beg for mercy

1583
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:15,800
as I feast on your heart...

1584
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:17,590
slow.

1585
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:22,930
Are you making some big evil
guy speech right now or something?

1586
01:49:23,010 --> 01:49:26,560
You're, like, a mile away from me
right now. There's cars and trucks.

1587
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:29,600
I will have the world eating
out of the palm of my hand...

1588
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:32,150
All I see is mouth
moving. I don't hear any...

1589
01:49:32,230 --> 01:49:35,730
Only I have the
power to unleash...

1590
01:49:37,650 --> 01:49:38,940
Ah, whatever. Screw it.

1591
01:50:09,890 --> 01:50:11,230
Oh, my gosh. Those people!

1592
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:20,440
Hi!

1593
01:50:20,530 --> 01:50:21,900
Wow. I caught you.

1594
01:50:33,370 --> 01:50:35,960
I got it. I got it.

1595
01:50:42,170 --> 01:50:43,930
Oh, my God. I do got it.

1596
01:51:00,270 --> 01:51:01,420
You're not gonna believe this,

1597
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:03,420
but you're actually the
first villain I've ever fought.

1598
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:05,070
It's kind of a huge deal for me.

1599
01:51:19,460 --> 01:51:22,000
Somebody help!

1600
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:39,020
Hi. Wow. It's really you.

1601
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:42,860
My name is Darla, and
I've been really good.

1602
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:43,940
What?

1603
01:51:47,990 --> 01:51:49,160
Oh, crap.

1604
01:51:50,660 --> 01:51:51,530
No, no, no.

1605
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:52,620
No, no. No!

1606
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:12,220
No! No, no.

1607
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:21,480
Oh, my God!

1608
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:23,230
Is he giving us
suitcase wedgies?

1609
01:53:00,390 --> 01:53:02,270
So this is, like, the
Seven Deadly Sins, right?

1610
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:05,940
I mean, I've never
been great at math,

1611
01:53:06,030 --> 01:53:08,820
but, uh, the big, angry
one, that's Wrath, yeah?

1612
01:53:08,900 --> 01:53:10,910
And then Gluttony, obvi.

1613
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:15,240
Pride, Greed, Sloth, Lust,

1614
01:53:15,330 --> 01:53:18,960
who I thought was gonna be
way hotter, if I'm being honest.

1615
01:53:19,620 --> 01:53:22,710
But that's only six. Where's
lucky number seven?

1616
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:25,000
Where's little man?
Where's Envy?

1617
01:53:25,090 --> 01:53:27,760
Is he just scared of me and my
family because we're so awesome?

1618
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:28,840
Because I get that.

1619
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:31,590
Like, the other sins, they
get to come out and fight

1620
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:33,550
because they're big
and strong and scary.

1621
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:34,720
But Envy...

1622
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:37,560
he's just the runt.

1623
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:53,240
And that's why all the other sins
never invite him out to play, man.

1624
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:55,120
Because they all know who'd win.

1625
01:53:56,030 --> 01:54:01,330
And it's not weak,
worthless, ugly Envy.

1626
01:54:27,570 --> 01:54:29,150
Gotcha.

1627
01:54:29,230 --> 01:54:31,280
Shazam!

1628
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:39,080
Shazam!

1629
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:51,260
Ready to go round
up your buddies?

1630
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:23,910
No. No!

1631
01:55:53,610 --> 01:55:55,990
Here's the thing about power.

1632
01:55:56,110 --> 01:55:59,820
What good's power, if you
got nobody to share it with?

1633
01:56:01,450 --> 01:56:03,200
- Nice.
- Ta-da!

1634
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:04,200
That's disgusting.

1635
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:05,290
Fatality.

1636
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,040
I got the voice.

1637
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:12,790
What's that?

1638
01:56:18,510 --> 01:56:20,680
I can have anything
I've ever wanted?

1639
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:25,680
Billy.

1640
01:56:25,810 --> 01:56:26,980
No, no, no!

1641
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:28,520
- Stop it!
- Don't look at that!

1642
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:29,850
Billy, don't do it!

1643
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:32,020
Ah!

1644
01:56:32,650 --> 01:56:34,820
- You should hear yourselves!
- Not funny.

1645
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:36,940
You think I'm gonna put
a demon ball in my head?

1646
01:56:37,030 --> 01:56:37,950
That's disgusting.

1647
01:56:38,030 --> 01:56:40,410
That's funny. That's pretty
funny. You got me going.

1648
01:56:40,490 --> 01:56:41,990
- You got me going.
- Uh... Guys.

1649
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:46,240
What?

1650
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:49,580
Oh. Hey.

1651
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:52,540
Oh, wow.

1652
01:57:00,090 --> 01:57:01,430
All right, We did it!

1653
01:57:01,510 --> 01:57:05,510
Hey, all right, yeah! We did it!

1654
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:08,930
We did it!

1655
01:57:09,350 --> 01:57:12,270
Hey, you guys are all safe.
There's no more danger anymore.

1656
01:57:12,350 --> 01:57:14,690
- We're fine. It's okay.
- All right, all right, all right.

1657
01:57:14,770 --> 01:57:15,820
We're good.

1658
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:27,870
You sure this is gonna work?

1659
01:57:29,620 --> 01:57:30,660
Told ya.

1660
01:57:31,210 --> 01:57:32,420
Whoa!

1661
01:57:34,210 --> 01:57:35,210
Whoa!

1662
01:57:50,020 --> 01:57:51,540
You guys know what
this place is, right?

1663
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:54,690
A dark, haunted cave
with demon statues.

1664
01:57:54,770 --> 01:57:57,440
Well, yes, but also...

1665
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:03,320
Lair! We got a lair!

1666
01:58:03,410 --> 01:58:04,530
- Lair.
- Yeah.

1667
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:05,660
No, you right.

1668
01:58:05,740 --> 01:58:07,280
We got a lair.

1669
01:58:09,290 --> 01:58:10,540
What's a lair?

1670
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:13,210
And thanks to six superheroes,

1671
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:17,380
citizens are back in their homes,
safe again with their families.

1672
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:19,920
And here with an eyewitness
account of the events...

1673
01:58:20,010 --> 01:58:22,260
It was crazy, man!

1674
01:58:22,340 --> 01:58:24,260
Creatures from hell!

1675
01:58:24,340 --> 01:58:26,930
Lightning coming out
of everyone's everything!

1676
01:58:27,010 --> 01:58:29,770
And that is not cool, man!

1677
01:58:29,850 --> 01:58:31,890
So, first day as a superhero.

1678
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:35,100
Automatic top
spot for best ever.

1679
01:58:35,190 --> 01:58:37,020
The man shattered
the glass noodle ceiling.

1680
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:38,860
- No. That's racist.
- Not if I say it.

1681
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:39,940
Guys.

1682
01:58:41,070 --> 01:58:42,440
- All hands on deck.
- Oh!

1683
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:46,990
Wait, wait, wait.

1684
01:58:47,070 --> 01:58:48,120
Wait.

1685
01:58:48,200 --> 01:58:49,790
Thank you for this food.

1686
01:58:49,870 --> 01:58:51,910
Thank you for this day.

1687
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,040
Thank you for this family.

1688
01:58:54,120 --> 01:58:56,210
I thought maybe
this time I'd stay.

1689
01:58:57,630 --> 01:59:00,380
I mean, after all,

1690
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:01,460
I'm home.

1691
01:59:33,450 --> 01:59:35,210
He better not sit at our table.

1692
01:59:38,540 --> 01:59:39,670
Nope!

1693
01:59:42,170 --> 01:59:43,170
Okay.

1694
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:48,220
What are you doing?

1695
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:50,350
Waiting for your
imaginary BFF to show up?

1696
01:59:50,430 --> 01:59:51,600
Yeah.

1697
02:00:00,270 --> 02:00:01,430
What are you guys doing here?

1698
02:00:01,770 --> 02:00:03,190
Well, we're having
lunch with you.

1699
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:04,920
But you guys have
different lunch periods.

1700
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:07,000
Well, we made a very
special arrangement.

1701
02:00:08,740 --> 02:00:11,280
- Darla, what's going on?
- Why are you asking me?

1702
02:00:11,990 --> 02:00:12,990
Freddy Freeman.

1703
02:00:15,450 --> 02:00:20,750
This guy taught me everything I
know about being a dope superhero.

1704
02:00:20,830 --> 02:00:23,130
True story. You should
get some pointers from him.

1705
02:00:23,210 --> 02:00:27,720
What's going on, my best
bud in the whole world?

1706
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:32,100
And also new kids that I'm meeting
for the first time but seem very cool?

1707
02:00:32,430 --> 02:00:33,430
Uh...

1708
02:00:33,470 --> 02:00:36,270
I invited another friend.
I hope that's okay.

1709
02:00:50,570 --> 02:00:52,570

Resynced by KID 

Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

1710
02:03:32,990 --> 02:03:37,240
Sun of Ra.

1711
02:03:38,490 --> 02:03:45,080
Ouroboros.

1712
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:50,460
Solomon's...

1713
02:03:50,540 --> 02:03:52,840
Knot.

1714
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:07,520
No! No!

1715
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:16,780
Primitive symbols.

1716
02:04:16,860 --> 02:04:21,580
You walking, talking monkeys
with your cave drawings.

1717
02:04:22,330 --> 02:04:26,410
You assume there's only
one way to gain magic.

1718
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:28,290
No, no, no.

1719
02:04:29,540 --> 02:04:32,420
There are more ways
than a mind can imagine.

1720
02:04:33,550 --> 02:04:35,420
What in God's name?

1721
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:39,970
I name the gods, Doctor.
Not the other way around.

1722
02:04:40,050 --> 02:04:43,260
Oh, what fun we're
going to have together.

1723
02:04:43,350 --> 02:04:47,310
The Seven Realms
are about to be ours.

1724
02:11:13,740 --> 02:11:16,030
Don't beat yourself up, buddy.
You're gonna find someone.

1725
02:11:16,870 --> 02:11:18,620
Yeah, I'm sure.

1726
02:11:18,700 --> 02:11:20,990
Because there's
plenty of fish in the sea.

1727
02:11:22,700 --> 02:11:24,500
Of course it's not
real. I can't talk to fish.

1728
02:11:24,620 --> 02:11:27,310
Even if I could, I mean, honestly,
what could we do with that that's cool?

1729
02:11:27,330 --> 02:11:31,590
I don't know, maybe command
an army of billions in the ocean.

1730
02:11:31,670 --> 02:11:34,840
Oh, yeah. Well,
that's not that cool.
