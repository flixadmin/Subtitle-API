1
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,600
Bava, these bank guys…

2
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,760
If we come on time,
they say it's tea break,

3
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,100
and if we're late,
they say it's lunch break.

4
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,050
Let's hurry up.

5
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,770
Here’s the money you asked for, sir.

6
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,060
- Hey!
- Hey, who are you guys?

7
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,050
Bava!

8
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,720
- Chalapathi!
- Four million, man. Hey, give me the bag!

9
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,690
Hand it over!

10
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,800
- Four million…
- Give it to me.

11
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,470
Bava…

12
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,720
The money…

13
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,810
I knew about 24-carat gold,

14
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,890
but he is a 24-carat character, Bava.

15
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,690
What a good time!
You're getting a son-in-law who can fight.

16
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,390
For the first time,
I'm feeling sad about being born as a man.

17
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,010
Had I been born as a woman…

18
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,600
He has done what even our own people
wouldn’t dare to do.

19
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,890
- Yes.
- He is our son-in-law.

20
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,150
- You can fix it.
- What?

21
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,360
Trust me!

22
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,760
How about caste, family, and status?

23
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,300
Bava, you can adjust all that
if you get a guy with talent and timing.

24
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,310
The money is safe.

25
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,970
I can’t believe
someone like you exists these days.

26
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,770
You helped us just in time, sir.

27
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,890
- Many thanks, sir…
- Never mind. I hate praises.

28
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,190
It’s easy to earn money,

29
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,230
but very difficult to protect it.
Please take care of it.

30
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,360
All that is fine, but what is your caste?

31
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,190
I know pancakes and dosas.
Now what is this?

32
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,850
- Never heard of it.
- Your full name, by the way?

33
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,110
Parvataneni Papa Rao.
They gave me my grandfather’s name.

34
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,720
He is our Parvataneni…

35
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,190
- So, Kammas?
- No, Chowdarys.

36
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,310
It’s all the same. We are all one.

37
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,430
See? My parents raised me
without even knowing what my caste was!

38
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,220
It’s okay, son.

39
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,230
Innocent parents.

40
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,440
- What do you do, son?
- I cleared the group exams.

41
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,650
Awaiting the posting.

42
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,770
My family is looking for a bride for me.

43
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,480
- Ask them to stop.
- Why?

44
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,940
Bava, we should catch the young
by the net.

45
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,020
Hello, man, you're coming over
for a match meeting at our house tomorrow.

46
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,720
Tomorrow? What about my family?

47
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,690
You are coming with all of them
to our house to see our girl.

48
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,140
Okay, as you wish.

49
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,150
Please come. Welcome.
Glad you're on time.

50
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,230
Of course, we came.

51
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,940
But why is this match meeting
arranged in an outhouse?

52
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,520
- Sister…
- No, ma’am. It’s our house.

53
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,930
Looks like our outhouse.

54
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,300
Are you sure they will match our status?

55
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,010
- Go in now…
- Please come in.

56
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,310
This house was built 100 years ago.

57
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,600
Couldn’t you buy another house
in the last 100 years?

58
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,730
Sister…

59
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,230
Brother, I'm checking about their assets.
Shouldn’t I?

60
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,150
Sister, not sure. For me, the smile
that never fades is the best property.

61
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,310
Looks like our son-in-law
has modern thoughts.

62
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,260
It’s not enough to have modern thoughts.

63
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,180
We should also check out financially.
That’s why we came.

64
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,610
What business are you in?

65
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,550
We have been in the
tobacco business for ages.

66
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,890
We are good until people stop smoking.

67
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,350
- How about you?
- We are in the incense business.

68
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,970
We are also good
until people stop inhaling, Uncle.

69
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,650
Why delay then?
Let’s call the girl. What do you say?

70
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,360
- Sister…
- Brother…

71
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
The girl.

72
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,010
I can see.

73
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Oh, God!

74
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,260
- Sister, are you okay?
- What is this?

75
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,430
Steel glasses. New ones.
We just bought these for you.

76
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,610
Does steel glass look like this?

77
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,480
We only use silver glasses at home.

78
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,400
We gave steel glasses
to our servants 25 years ago.

79
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,860
Don’t counter, Bava. Rich people…

80
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,760
- Elder daughter-in-law, Suhasini.
- 85 kg.

81
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,510
- Second daughter-in-law, Paddu.
- 76 kg.

82
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,310
What about the younger daughter-in-law?

83
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,010
A total of 110 kg.

84
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,850
We are superior in this matter.

85
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,440
Don’t get confused, Mr. Chalapathi.

86
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,190
My sister wasn't just talking
about their weight,

87
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,060
but also the gold they brought as dowry.

88
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,850
- Sister, take over now.
- Brother, thanks.

89
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,140
Let me tell you all openly.

90
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,940
We are from Bezawada.

91
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,650
We are very particular
about customs and manners.

92
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,310
Of course, we know that!

93
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,970
Bezawada means the Goddess
on top of the hill. And below--

94
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,650
Bava! No controversies, Bava.

95
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,270
So, you were saying something.

96
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,800
Listen. As per our custom,

97
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,690
we weigh the girl
during the match meeting,

98
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,060
and she brings gold worth her weight.

99
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,510
God, save me.

100
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,300
She is already heavy.
On top of it, weighing her!

101
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,800
You have no choice, sir.

102
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,510
Anyway, you need to pay after the wedding.
Consider it an advance booking.

103
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,970
Trust me!
We are okay with your challenge!

104
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,180
Here’s a 22-carat gold coin.

105
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,150
Seven-week ornaments.

106
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,520
Gold biscuits from Bombay.

107
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,360
These all are from Bengal.

108
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,680
Forget about weighing her.
The needle isn’t even moving.

109
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,760
Hey, Mr. Gold?
Don’t you have more gold at home?

110
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,800
It’s okay.
We’ll make up the difference with cash.

111
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,560
Glad you said that.
Hey, bring the cash.

112
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,610
Here is the money my Bava earned
from the tobacco business.

113
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,850
Well done!

114
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,900
- Jhansi ma'am!
- Sir!

115
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,690
Seize everything and seal it.

116
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,760
- I will sign and stamp it.
- Okay, sir.

117
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,640
We’re from the Income Tax Department.

118
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,430
You said they were our people
and made them part of the family.

119
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,440
Now everything is ruined!

120
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,640
Bava!

121
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,150
Stop the car.

122
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,970
- Do you need a lift, my son?
- Yes, of course.

123
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,110
Please get in.

124
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,800
Politicians don’t give
anything even if we ask.

125
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,800
You’re giving a lift without even asking.

126
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,850
We’re not able to give anything
to the people after being in power,

127
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,180
so I thought I’d at least give a lift.

128
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,510
You drive.

129
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,980
What do you do, man?

130
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,430
Should we have tea somewhere?

131
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,650
I was an IT officer until yesterday, sir.

132
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,270
So, if you were
an income tax officer until yesterday,

133
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,050
something happened yesterday.

134
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,480
What was it?

135
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,390
Morning…

136
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,890
Good morning, Jhansi ma’am.

137
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,480
What happened, Murthy sir?

138
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,770
He could have become a son-in-law,

139
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,400
but now he’s getting insulted.

140
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,980
Just because you have power in hand,
do you think you can go to anyone’s house?

141
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,760
Do you know who Mr. Jagga Rao is?

142
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,180
Officer, don’t tell him anything about me.

143
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,810
He’ll understand on his own soon.

144
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,900
Sure, sir.

145
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,650
Apologize to him if you want to
at least keep your job.

146
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,610
After doing a few raids
and achieving success in his career,

147
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,300
he started seeing stars,
his head held high.

148
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,850
I’ll bring him down.
I’ll bring everything down today.

149
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,800
Okay, your wish.

150
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,980
Stop!

151
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,190
What happened to your manhood?

152
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,980
Are you ashamed to touch my feet
in front of everyone?

153
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,230
Not acceptable.

154
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,400
Everyone in your department should know
what happens if someone targets me.

155
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,060
What is this, sir?

156
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,520
A tribute to honesty.

157
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,350
Watch and learn.

158
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,400
Take off my sandal with your hand
and lean your head against my leg.

159
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,940
Then I’ll think about your job.

160
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,220
Oh, God!

161
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,360
Oh, God!

162
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,260
How could you beat such a powerful man?

163
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,980
This is how.

164
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,770
Now you can wear them, sir. Wear them.

165
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,270
What? Powerful?

166
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,610
In what way?

167
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,010
No matter how many millions he has,

168
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,300
he got beaten with a sandal by a guy
earning four thousand rupees a month.

169
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,140
Is he powerful, or am I?

170
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
What did you say?

171
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,180
That I got an attitude
after a few successful raids?

172
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,390
Success and failures are visitors.

173
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,940
They come and go.

174
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,140
Attitude is like our surname.

175
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,480
It stays with us until we die.

176
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,560
Krishna Murthy sir, give me a cigarette.

177
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,730
Sir, in here?

178
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,760
Doesn’t matter where,
after getting suspended.

179
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,560
By the way,
my name isn’t Parvataneni Papa Rao.

180
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,360
Bachchan.

181
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,600
Mr. Bachchan.

182
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,300
You must have heard the name.

183
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,520
Now you’ll remember it.

184
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,970
It’s not poverty
that afflicts this country, sir.

185
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,770
It’s black money.

186
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,010
And if the poor man is suffering,
it’s because of black money.

187
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,350
Still, if the country is running fine,
it’s because of sincere officers like you.

188
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,430
Sincere officers aren’t enough, sir.

189
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,020
We need sincere politicians.

190
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,440
Noted, sir.

191
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,730
By the way, why is your name Mr. Bachchan?

192
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,480
- Are you North Indian?
- Nothing like that, sir.

193
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,940
We’re pure Telugu, from Andhra Pradesh.

194
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,980
Do you know what happened on August 15th?

195
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,800
I’m a politician, and you’re asking me?

196
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,550
You are talking about August 15th, 1947.

197
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,230
I’m talking about August 15th, 1975.

198
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,190
That day, Sholay released
in 70mm stereophonic sound.

199
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,810
- So?
- Our lives changed from that day.

200
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,310
My father is a big fan of Sholay.

201
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,850
It's time for the show.

202
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,260
He watched it at least 100 times.

203
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,140
LAKSHMI TOURING TALKIES

204
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,360
Sholay… what a movie!

205
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,010
And my father came home in that madness…

206
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,810
My son, from today,
your name is Amitabh Bachchan.

207
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,360
Daddy, my name is Anand,
not Amitabh Bachchan.

208
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,510
Then you’re Anand Bachchan.

209
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,890
- And your friend’s name is Veeru.
- Me?

210
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,400
- And you?
- Thakur. Thakur of Ramgarh.

211
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,560
- What kind of name is that?
- You shut up, Basanti.

212
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,100
Now, who is she?

213
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,760
It’s you!

214
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,220
He changed our surname to Ramgarh

215
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,890
and attached a sidecar to my scooter.

216
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,480
I don’t pick up money
that’s thrown, even today.

217
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,890
- Deewaar.
- I have my mother with me.

218
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,390
I love you, my son.

219
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,560
Bachchan. Mr. Bachchan.

220
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,270
You must have heard the name.

221
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,760
Bachchan. My Bachchan.

222
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,270
With that, my name got fixed.

223
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,050
Couldn’t you change it after growing up?

224
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,650
He gave me birth.
Can’t I give him that much happiness?

225
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,560
From today,
not only am I a fan of that Bachchan,

226
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,110
- but I’m also a fan of this Bachchan.
- Thank you, sir.

227
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,690
If everything goes well, we’ll meet again.

228
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,690
Sure, sir.

229
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,100
Hey, I’m not getting a good card.

230
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,390
You're so dead today!

231
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,560
Hey, look, after a long time,
the Joker is coming.

232
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,110
Hey, you gambler!

233
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,140
Hey, Bachchan! You kiddo!

234
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,400
I’m the rising hand in this place.

235
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,980
Be careful with your words.

236
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,520
Your hand might be rising
in playing cards.

237
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,510
My hand rises in any game.

238
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,640
I’m the care-of-address for sarcasm.

239
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,930
I’ll smack your head off
if you play with me.

240
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,680
If not for bad luck,

241
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,520
how could a guy singing
in an orchestra become an IT officer?

242
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,760
And a guy owning 500 acres of land
is playing cards with these five people?

243
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,720
- Time, man. Time.
- It’s 1 p.m., brother. It’s lunchtime.

244
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,900
I will kick you on your back. Play now.

245
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,510
Basanti, look who’s here!

246
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,390
Thakur Baldev Singh!

247
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:00,760
You're back!

248
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,400
My lovely son.

249
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,860
Fresh up and come. Have lunch.

250
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,970
Not sure when you last ate.

251
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,480
My Bhagyalaxmi!

252
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,140
- My Bachchan!
- Bachchan is back!

253
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,140
- Brother, it's been so long!
- How many days are you camping here?

254
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,560
Should we start the orchestra again?

255
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,680
If you say yes, we can accept
programs for all the villages around.

256
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,520
- Stay at least till Vinayaka Chavithi.
- I’ll sign up for all the Navaratris.

257
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,850
Why only Chavithi?

258
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,050
I’ll be here until Dasara,
Diwali, and Sankranti.

259
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,470
They suspended me.

260
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,360
Such good news, my son.

261
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,900
I expected something when
the phone got disconnected.

262
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,270
The government may be late
in giving us what we deserve.

263
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,100
But when they have to
throw us out, they do it fast.

264
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,520
You said it right, my son.

265
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,560
I’ll take advances
for all the festivals then.

266
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,400
Go ahead and take them.
This is Kotipalli's Kumar Sanu.

267
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,150
He’ll hold the mic again
and sing the songs.

268
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,430
- Come, Mr. Pankaj.
- Greetings.

269
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,810
No puja can start in this temple unless
you play a cassette.

270
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,390
Which song are you playing today?

271
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,020
Seetha Kalyanam.

272
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,970
Our daughter is on her way.

273
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,350
You’ll get what you need
for the puja soon.

274
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,890
Hail Lord Ram.

275
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,230
- It’s time for a card game.
- Brother…

276
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,770
- What?
- Sister-in-law, bro.

277
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,100
Jikki!

278
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,730
Oh, no.

279
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,300
This Dorababu is there
to take you to the temple, right?

280
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,760
Why these adventures?
Now see what happened.

281
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,230
Go away.

282
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,350
One minute.

283
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,890
He will break the chain.

284
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,940
Hey, gambler! Get up!

285
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,060
Is he pulling her half-sari,
or my queen as well?

286
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,010
Both, bro.

287
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,650
Thank you.

288
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,940
You're welcome for a lifetime.

289
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,310
Has Bachchan become even more glamorous?

290
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,100
No! Men should be dark
and women should be fair.

291
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,050
That’s the rule.

292
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,510
Look at him. He looks fair and pale.

293
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,440
HAIL LORD RAM

294
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,560
Why are you chasing
after the bicycle chain, dude?

295
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,010
DONATION BOX

296
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,690
Hail Lord Ram.

297
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,560
Look, he put in twenty rupees!

298
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,270
As if he did something great.

299
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,350
What’s the big deal
about donating twenty rupees?

300
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,900
I can put in a hundred rupees.

301
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,850
It’s a sin. God is watching.

302
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,260
Whether a note or a word,
once it slips, it belongs to Lord Krishna.

303
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,720
Why talk about Krishna
in the temple of Ram?

304
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,480
- I will take my ten thousand.
- Even then,

305
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,650
you can only put money
in the donation box.

306
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,650
You can’t take it away. It’s a sin.

307
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,230
- My ten thousand.
- It's a sin.

308
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,730
Ten thousand. This sin is yours.

309
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,610
As if you are a rising hand, right?

310
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,360
I've talked about the Ramayana.

311
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,640
What did you understand?
Summarize it in one word.

312
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,270
Wives should always
listen to their husbands.

313
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,140
Since she didn’t listen to her husband,
Goddess Sita faced many difficulties.

314
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,430
This is what women
should learn from the Ramayana.

315
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,510
You stop, man.

316
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,850
Just because the wife
asked for a golden deer

317
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,180
or a monkey on the mountain,
a husband shouldn’t venture out.

318
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,550
That’s why he kidnapped Goddess Sita.

319
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:21,970
Trust.

320
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,050
The Ramayana is about trust.

321
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,550
Sita trusted that Ram
would come to Ashoka Vanam.

322
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,100
It’s not good for you to run after me
after I thanked you for helping me.

323
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,430
When did I run after you?
I’m standing right in front of you.

324
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,100
It’s amazing if a guy like this
runs after or stands in front.

325
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,050
Yeah, girl.

326
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,390
Tell me if you aren’t interested.
I will try for myself.

327
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,770
The guy is showing his intelligence.

328
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,720
Yes.

329
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,310
You can’t love with intelligence.

330
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,390
You fall in love without being aware.

331
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,730
And I fell!

332
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,010
Let’s go!

333
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,970
Hey girl, I’m talking to you. Stop…

334
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,970
Why are you walking in reverse,
unlike others?

335
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:20,940
It is said in the ancient scriptures

336
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,940
that someone born facing in reverse
should also walk in reverse.

337
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,060
Why don’t you tell me your name?

338
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,150
I won’t.

339
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,150
- I will make you reveal it.
- My tongue won’t slip.

340
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,220
You will slip.

341
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,230
- Jikki!
- What happened, Jikki?

342
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,360
Are you okay, Jikki?

343
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,900
Jikki… What is your name, Jikki?

344
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,190
Say it, Jikki!

345
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,020
Say it, Jikki!

346
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,510
Was it necessary? Jikki, Jikki, Jikki!

347
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,050
Jikki, you are very lucky!

348
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,470
Naughtily, like a design

349
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,720
She knotted me with playful looks

350
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,010
Oh, my girl, because of you

351
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:22,690
Music is playing in my heart

352
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,980
My heart took an oath after seeing you

353
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:40,180
Crossed the barrier and beaten heavily

354
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,650
Held the girl’s hand with strong resolve

355
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,360
How to stop after getting ignited?

356
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,760
My heart caught by you
Refusing to get down from the cloud

357
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:55,430
Carved your idol
And worshiped you every day, Jikki

358
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,560
I’m emphasizing

359
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,600
If our acquaintance
Turns into love and makes us a couple

360
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,260
No one is luckier than you

361
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,190
My heart took an oath after seeing you

362
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,190
Crossed the barrier and beaten heavily

363
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,890
The waistline that breaks my bravery
Kills me totally

364
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,810
The lip-line that was filled with spirits
Makes me go crazy

365
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,640
The thoughts that are refusing to leave me
Fighting them with the help of the sleep

366
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,190
The body that knew the taste of pleasure
Embrace it with your kisses

367
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:38,940
Listening to your voice
Not sure why hurry

368
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,560
Watching everything
Is noise your way?

369
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,600
Will your tactic work?
Will your plan click?

370
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,970
Don’t say no to me anymore

371
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,900
My heart took an oath after seeing you

372
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,760
Crossed the barrier and beaten heavily

373
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,510
Held the girl’s hand with strong resolve

374
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:07,350
How to stop after getting ignited?

375
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,860
My lovely lady
Is it harmful to give a kiss?

376
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,190
Sulking great or what?
Not wrong giving intimacy

377
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,060
The flames that approach me
Are burning me alive

378
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,680
In the girl’s heart filled with memories
I hear many murmurs

379
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,400
Your heart is a poem
Your word is a melody

380
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,020
Your name is so novel
Looks good luckily

381
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,970
If you behave well
I will say yes happily

382
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,550
Don’t keep me at a distance

383
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:08,550
My heart took an oath after seeing you

384
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,010
Crossed the barrier and beaten heavily

385
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,230
Held the girl’s hand with strong resolve

386
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,770
How to stop after getting ignited?

387
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,360
Hello, mic testing! One, two, three…

388
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,850
What is this, brother?
At the wedding, as well?

389
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,900
Dumbo.

390
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,060
A wedding can happen without festivities
but not without a card game.

391
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,350
It’s a rule.

392
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,140
Is it? Then give me a card as well.

393
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,110
- Brother?
- Yes.

394
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,010
You're playing a card game here.
What about after the wedding?

395
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,440
Chess, man.

396
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,430
Chess after the wedding.

397
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,680
They take one step, and we take one.

398
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,690
Welcome to all the people of Kotipalli.

399
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:07,730
For all the weddings
and celebrations, contact A1 Orchestra.

400
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,300
The first song in this music
program is "Bhale Manchi Roju."

401
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,550
And the singer is our local Balu.

402
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,180
A1 ORCHESTRA

403
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,680
What is this nuisance?

404
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,100
I've been hearing the same song play
since my wedding.

405
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,360
I cannot change my wife.
Ask him to change the song, at least.

406
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,390
Wish I get a queen in this game.

407
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:45,890
Take it.

408
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,430
Haven’t your parents come, Jikki?

409
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,510
- They are coming, behind me.
- He came.

410
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,510
He doesn’t have any other work.

411
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:00,480
Everyone in this village
is getting married.

412
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:06,730
Except for me and you.

413
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,100
What do you think?

414
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,360
There is a thin line
between hope and greed.

415
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,400
However, in life, it is different.

416
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,900
The abyss.

417
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,360
The what?

418
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,300
Let’s go.

419
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,470
He got it nicely.

420
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,930
What happened now, brother?

421
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,050
She said even if it’s greed,
I kept all my hopes on you.

422
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,190
I will not leave you despite all odds.

423
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,730
I can give it in writing.

424
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,190
Silly girl. She dies for me.

425
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,230
Why did this cycle chain fellow come here?

426
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,480
It’s Marwari’s wedding, right?
Maybe he came to sing some Hindi songs.

427
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,650
Come, let’s sit.

428
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,550
Hey, you!

429
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,510
He is Kumar Sanu of Kotipalli, bro.
Sings Hindi songs well.

430
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,150
He is singing intentionally.

431
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,520
He keeps singing "pyaar" all the time.
What is this "pyaar," anyway?

432
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,550
- "Pyaar" means pigeon.
- Is it?

433
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,930
Yes, Prema Pavuralu movie.
Haven’t we watched it?

434
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,400
Hey, his singing is so bad.

435
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,860
People are shameless, dude.

436
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,680
They’re just clapping
despite not understanding anything.

437
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,800
Let’s go.

438
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,300
Mr. Bachchan. I’m sure you heard the song.

439
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,900
Why so much attitude, Mr. Bachchan?

440
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,610
Why don’t you give some to your friends?

441
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,510
Yes. Look at how dull they’re looking.

442
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,510
You're right.

443
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,260
By the way, Ms. Jikki,
why do you need so much beauty?

444
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,470
Can’t you share some with your friends?

445
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,190
Look at how pale and dull they’re looking.

446
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:56,860
If the caterer is a friend,
the food tastes good.

447
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,310
This proverb doesn’t
match with the original.

448
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,550
It’s a proverb, not the Bhagavad Gita.

449
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,890
It can be changed.

450
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,940
- What is this?
- Memories.

451
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,860
In fifty years, you'll be telling our
grandchildren about how I pursued you.

452
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,260
Such wonderful memories.

453
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,850
Please leave me. I’m not comfortable.

454
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,720
Please forgive me.

455
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,400
I will never come near you again.

456
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,470
If my love is truly genuine,

457
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,890
you will come searching for me.

458
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,470
Until then…

459
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,900
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

460
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,730
I’m Srinivas from the
Income Tax Department.

461
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,690
Please sit.

462
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,650
We’re going on a raid
and need police support.

463
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,550
Sure.

464
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:54,730
On whom?

465
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:55,970
Muthyam Jaghayya.

466
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,690
- Muthyam Jaghayya?!
- Yes, sir.

467
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:03,220
Muthyam Jaghayya may be
new to you, but not to this area.

468
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:13,760
Three months ago, an excise officer
named Rama Krishna raided his warehouse.

469
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,860
Come on!

470
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,600
Crush them!

471
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,190
Don't spare even a single bottle.

472
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,930
Sir, it seems that he's an excise officer.

473
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,980
He destroyed all our stock.

474
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,390
No, sir.

475
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,430
If any officers come to my home,

476
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,800
it should be either to beg
or to seek my blessing.

477
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,970
But I came to arrest you.

478
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,470
I like you!

479
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,020
That’s why I like you!

480
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,440
- Sambashiva…
- Brother.

481
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,190
Please felicitate him.

482
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,010
He came from very far.

483
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,800
- I’m not scared of your silly deeds.
- You should be scared!

484
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:39,220
If any fool dares to come
to my house from now on,

485
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,100
they should die of fear,

486
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,480
not of my strength.

487
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,690
I have the entire system behind me.
You can’t do anything to me.

488
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,890
System?

489
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,640
When you were born, you were alone.

490
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,730
When you die, you will be alone.

491
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,680
By the time you understand this,

492
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:06,770
it will be too late, Tayaramma.
Tayaramma…

493
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,110
You did your duty very well.

494
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,760
But what about my duty?

495
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,940
Let me go!

496
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:24,430
Where were you when the excise officer
raided the warehouse?

497
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,560
I went to the temple
to perform the ritual, sir.

498
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:32,900
Instead of treating your boss like a God,
if you went to the temple,

499
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,440
what does that mean?
Am I a god or a fool?

500
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,680
In my anger, I should have
sent you to meet that God as well.

501
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,150
But 30 years of companionship…

502
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,430
makes me forgive you.

503
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:53,110
Go and beg at that same temple. Go!

504
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,860
Even after hearing this,
if you still want to go--

505
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,970
SI sir, have you found
any information about my husband?

506
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,270
It’s not right to make me
come here so many times.

507
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,550
You filed a complaint, right? Be patient.

508
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:09,810
We’re working on it.

509
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,850
He’s a government officer like you.

510
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,760
Would you be so indifferent
if something happened to one of your own?

511
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,520
- Why aren’t you speaking?
- One minute.

512
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,230
Now tell me, why did you come?

513
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,020
Someone picked my pocket
at the bus stand, sir.

514
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,970
There’s nothing to worry about.
File a complaint,

515
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:28,940
and we’ll look into it.

516
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,940
- Thank you, sir.
- Tell me, ma'am.

517
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,400
How many times do I have to
come to the police station with this baby?

518
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,770
I don’t know what to tell her

519
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,100
when she keeps asking
for her father every day.

520
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:42,020
When will you find him?
Please, tell me, sir. Tell me.

521
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,850
- Please, Uncle.
- Please, sir.

522
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:52,400
- Aunty…
- Who is it?

523
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:55,480
It’s me, Aunty. Jikki.
Your daughter called

524
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,390
and said she’d call back in five minutes.

525
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,730
Oh, I’m busy, dear.

526
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,400
My son, it seems your sister called.
Go check.

527
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,810
The phone at our house got disconnected,

528
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,430
and you’re getting connected
in the form of a PP number!

529
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,770
It seems like it’s all written in fate.

530
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,190
Hello, what are you looking at?

531
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,480
Let's go.
My sister is waiting on the other side.

532
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,610
I don't even know
where your house is, right?

533
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,220
- This boy…
- Bhagyalaxmi Aunty’s son.

534
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,010
- A call came in.
- Greetings.

535
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,970
Please come in, son.

536
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,270
I liked what you said
about the Ramayana the other day.

537
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,430
Give that to me.

538
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:29,360
What else would a retiree
or a suspended officer do, Aunty,

539
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,440
other than pray to God?

540
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,060
- Phone.
- Thank you.

541
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,800
Hey, ACDC? What are you doing
in this house, idiot?

542
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,440
I’m the one who found this house
and arranged for them to buy it.

543
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,300
And I’m guarding it 24/7 like a watchdog.

544
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,220
Why? Doesn’t this house have any dogs?

545
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,760
Sis, hello. How are you?

546
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,310
I heard you’ve been free
for a while now. Mom told me.

547
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,470
So we looked for a girl for you.

548
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,730
No need. I’ve already found one.

549
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,480
The girl is right here looking at me.

550
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,520
This girl is gorgeous.

551
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,180
Even if she looks angry,
her eyes still shine.

552
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,930
Even if she pouts, she looks kissable.

553
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,230
No, listen.

554
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,180
Tell him they're filthy rich.
They’ll offer a large dowry.

555
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,260
Your brother-in-law says they're wealthy
and will provide a fat dowry.

556
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,600
Sister, what we don’t earn isn’t ours.

557
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,550
Marrying for dowry is like prostitution.

558
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:33,010
DELUXE CASSETTE CENTER

559
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,060
Where did you find this birdie?

560
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,220
Not a normal birdie.
She is a beautiful bird.

561
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,980
Very famous in the neighborhood.

562
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,470
Take this. TDK 120 Minutes.

563
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,980
A-side Amitabh. B-side Rajesh Khanna.
Load the songs.

564
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,810
Though you’re from the Marwari family,

565
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,690
you’re living in Telugu land,
eating Telugu rice and Telugu lentils--

566
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,980
Don’t overreact, dude.

567
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,480
- My father is a Kishore Kumar fan.
- And you?

568
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,550
Gaddar.

569
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,390
I’m a Gaddar fan.

570
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,230
I keep singing his songs.

571
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,650
Her father loves music.
Hence, he named her Jikki.

572
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,690
She sings better than all of you.

573
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,760
- Load A-side. Leave the B-side to me.
- No, dude.

574
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:06,720
- A-side Amitabh Bachchan--
- B-side also Bachchan.

575
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,190
Okay.

576
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,020
My first love letter
to my last lover, Jikki.

577
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,300
In cinema, they express love in songs.

578
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,100
But this is my life, right?

579
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,720
So, I’m saying it in my own words.

580
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,970
That day, what got knotted
was not just your sari,

581
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,600
but also my heart.

582
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,480
One knot yours. One knot mine.

583
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,480
And if the third knot is tied by God,

584
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,100
what more do I need?

585
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,190
From the moment I saw you there,

586
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,300
wherever I look, it’s you.

587
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,770
ROMANCE

588
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,260
I will keep you in my heart
like a Yandamuri novel.

589
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,860
I will preserve you in my heart
like Ilaiyaraaja songs.

590
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,560
Boiled peanuts.

591
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,050
It will come, see.

592
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,110
Here it is.

593
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,230
Thank you.

594
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,610
Green chilies! She will bring.

595
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,180
Onion fritters!

596
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,140
Oh, God! What is this?

597
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,940
You drink once in a lifetime,

598
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,270
but you're making too much out of it.

599
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,550
Just because it’s a street fight,
you can’t go unprepared, right, Aunty?

600
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,890
You shut up, man.

601
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,730
What is that comparison?

602
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,430
Enough…

603
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,690
Take it, Uncle.

604
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,550
- You have a soft drink, right?
- Yes, Uncle.

605
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,020
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

606
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,970
I’ve got a soft drink,
but where’s your drinking manners?

607
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,520
You’re having a drink
and a soft drink for me?

608
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,800
Your rule of

609
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:38,310
not drinking in the presence of elders
is amazing, Dorababu.

610
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,550
We have something
called culture. Right, Uncle?

611
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:41,810
Well said!

612
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,270
- What happened?
- Chemicals.

613
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,730
They are adding chemicals
to soft drinks as well.

614
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,770
My favorite, Kishore Kumar…

615
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,970
My family is searching for a girl for me.

616
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:41,220
- You are also anyway for Jikki--
- Shouldn’t there be some sense?

617
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,480
Uncle!

618
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:43,760
Who is he?

619
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,980
Bachchan from next door, Uncle.

620
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,930
He got suspended for taking bribes.

621
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,390
And he started the orchestra as always.

622
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,190
He is shameless, Uncle.

623
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:10,610
How dare he?

624
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:13,220
Can there be a competition between
Kishore Kumar and Kumar Sanu?

625
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,610
- Should I go and kill him?
- Jikki, ask him to stop his nuisance.

626
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,760
What’s this, buddy?
Why always Hindi songs?

627
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,300
Uncle, C major!

628
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,680
Let’s show how
a Telugu mass song sounds.

629
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:25,650
Okay, show me.

630
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,220
Master, hello?

631
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:52,760
I’m talking to you.

632
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,550
What's with all this nuisance?

633
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,550
From 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.,
we sing songs requested by listeners.

634
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,800
Any requests from you?

635
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:03,100
My father downstairs is
enjoying Kishore Kumar's songs.

636
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,310
Wow, Jikki, see how lucky you are!

637
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,440
Songs at your parents' place,
orchestra at your in-laws' place.

638
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:09,300
Jikki, you're really lucky.

639
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:10,930
My father doesn't appreciate all of this.

640
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,350
Normally, one might have a caste problem,

641
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:14,600
but it seems her father
has a taste problem instead.

642
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,550
That's true.

643
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,850
Our friend is called
Kotipalli's Kumar Sanu.

644
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:19,300
He won’t sing Kishore Kumar's songs.

645
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:22,850
Pack everything in two minutes and leave.

646
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,890
Forget me.

647
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,310
If you don’t leave in a minute,
you will land in trouble.

648
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,510
What happened?

649
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,010
If your father turns to the B-side
after completing the A-side,

650
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,850
he will realize that you are on my side.

651
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:58,720
- What happened?
- Enough for the day, Father.

652
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,050
Okay.

653
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:03,470
- Good night, Uncle.
- Good night.

654
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,480
My god. I see a cassette in your blouse.

655
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:11,980
And there’s something in the cassette.

656
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,510
Jikki!

657
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:15,390
Jikki, there's something in your blouse

658
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,520
that I want to see right now, right here.

659
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:22,980
It’s okay for her to hit me…

660
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:24,600
At least Jikki has finally touched me.

661
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:31,110
Jikki, let’s come up with an excuse
at home and go to the movies this evening.

662
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:32,300
Okay, dear.

663
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:35,690
What happened, dude?

664
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,150
You walked in so suddenly.

665
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:38,940
I wanted to see you.

666
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,400
A-side Rama Rao Garu, B-side
Nageshwara Rao Garu, load the songs.

667
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,850
Ghantasala sang for both.

668
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,430
So, why differentiate
between A-side and B-side?

669
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,020
I know, but he sings differently
for Rama Rao and Nageshwara Rao.

670
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,970
That’s what I call knowledge.

671
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,890
Not spoiling the business
while sitting next to me.

672
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,310
- So, completely on A-side and B-side--
- Move!

673
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:00,720
Are you only concerned
about the A-side and B-side,

674
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:02,940
or do you have any
intention of joining my side?

675
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:05,690
Tell me.

676
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,050
Once you reach Delhi, I expect a call
that my brother got the ticket.

677
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,640
You should make that call.

678
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:18,690
You're an MP,

679
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,610
your younger brother
is the Youth President,

680
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,900
and now you're seeking an
MLA ticket for your elder brother.

681
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:26,060
How can one family get so many positions?

682
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,760
Can members of one family
become Prime Ministers?

683
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:31,600
I cannot tolerate it
if you criticize the high command.

684
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:34,110
What will you do besides staying silent?

685
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,190
First, you need to get past this place
before taking any action.

686
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,190
You must have seen
leaders who manipulate votes.

687
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,890
This is Muthyam Jaghayya's area.

688
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:57,310
People disappear here.

689
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:01,360
I won’t be at this meeting.
Speak highly of my brother.

690
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,270
Mom, what's up?
The house is in darkness.

691
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:05,900
It’s okay.

692
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,230
Can you get me some water?

693
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,140
The fuse has blown.
Your father is handling it.

694
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:12,640
But the neighborhood has power,
and our house--

695
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:15,690
What's wrong, Mom?

696
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:18,150
Nothing, my son.
I slipped in the bathroom and fell.

697
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,510
You come. I'll serve you dinner.

698
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:23,010
What's with these injuries?

699
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:25,100
Son, please fix this fuse.

700
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:26,610
Dad, what happened to you?

701
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,430
Jikki, what are you doing here?
How did you get hurt?

702
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,190
Yeah, your mom said it right.
Slipped in the bathroom…

703
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:33,150
Did all of you slip in the bathroom
at the same time?

704
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:34,520
Jikki, what happened?

705
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,760
Earlier, Muthyam Jaghayya’s men came.

706
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,770
What’s the matter?

707
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,800
What do you guys want?

708
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:44,760
Muthyam Jaghayya's
meeting is happening outside.

709
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:46,430
We are drawing power from your house.

710
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,610
In that case, it won't handle the load,
and the fuse will blow.

711
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:51,470
Hey, if you utter another word,

712
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,230
forget the fuse,
your life might just blow away.

713
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:54,650
Bro, I found it.

714
00:48:54,730 --> 00:49:01,690
I congratulate the National Party workers
on my behalf and on behalf of our party.

715
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:08,110
Speaking of our young leader
Muthyam Sambashiva Rao,

716
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,440
he holds a lot of respect
for elders and the aged.

717
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,720
He has great affection for women.

718
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,140
He is not a man of words but of action.

719
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:32,800
Forget about fuses blowing.

720
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:37,140
Soon, all of their fuses will be blown.

721
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,810
- Where are you doing, my son?
- Don't stop him, Bhagyalaxmi.

722
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,520
They need to understand that they'll face
consequences if they mess with Bachchan.

723
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:46,980
In a nutshell, he is strict.

724
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:53,610
The future MLA, our youth leader
Sambashiva Rao, will speak now.

725
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:01,400
My greetings to the people of Kotipalli.

726
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,190
I was born here!

727
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:07,650
I was raised here!

728
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:11,560
I will represent this
place in the assembly.

729
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:17,680
- We will give our lives!
- We will give our lives for our brother!

730
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:21,310
- We will give our lives!
- We will give our lives for our brother!

731
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,970
They were saying something.
Did you take it seriously?

732
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,400
We will see during the elections, okay?

733
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:44,400
- Hey! Sit down!
- Sit down!

734
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,270
- Hey…
- Hey!

735
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,980
- Hey…
- Hey!

736
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,800
I like you guys.

737
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:53,640
I thought you were joking when
you said you'd give your lives.

738
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,020
Come on, then.

739
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:58,390
Give it.
Come, come, come…

740
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:04,140
Instead of asking for power,
you forcefully took it…

741
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,930
And you assaulted my
parents when they resisted.

742
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,150
You should apologize in front of everyone.

743
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:11,100
Or else…

744
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,400
So they've made their decision…
What's yours?

745
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,470
Apology? Or a cigarette?

746
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:22,010
- Sorry.
- What?

747
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:23,390
Sorry.

748
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,810
The entire street witnessed
my parents being assaulted.

749
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:30,400
Now, the entire town should
hear your apology to them.

750
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:32,180
Each and every one of them.

751
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,140
Indukuri Suryanarayana aka Thakur.

752
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,940
My apologies to Indukuri
Suryanarayana aka Thakur.

753
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:46,600
Indukuri Bhagyalaxmi aka Basanti.

754
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:52,310
My apologies to Indukuri
Bhagyalaxmi aka Basanti.

755
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,100
Jik…

756
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,270
Indukuri Jikki.

757
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:07,440
My apologies to Indukuri Jikki.

758
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,650
Thank you so much.

759
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:27,470
You know, right?

760
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:29,550
Since I didn't like his methods,

761
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,180
I resigned as a clerk to Muthyam Jaghayya

762
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:32,650
and started serving at the temple.

763
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,430
Why deal with such a person?

764
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,690
And you guys? At least you
should have intervened.

765
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:39,260
They announced her name on the microphone.

766
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:41,140
Once she steps out of her house,

767
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:44,430
the public will scrutinize her
and comment on her.

768
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,050
It's Bachchan who is at fault, Uncle.

769
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:48,860
He tried to impress the girl
and messed with them.

770
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,390
If I had known about the issue,

771
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:53,350
I could have easily
handled Muthyam Jaghayya.

772
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:57,890
A true man stands not just
by his parents but also by a girl.

773
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:01,310
Bachchan didn't do anything wrong, Dad.

774
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,940
He corrected the mistake.

775
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:13,020
- You are singing well. Don't feel bad.
- It's my training. What do you think?

776
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,890
These guys always stick around here.

777
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,220
Hey, all the ladies come to one side.

778
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,610
Our friend isn't able to breathe.

779
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:24,360
The entire women's group has
come for one cassette recording.

780
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,850
We should limit one person to
one cassette, just like a movie ticket.

781
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,150
- Correct.
- Why?

782
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:30,900
So that each one of you
can flirt with one girl?

783
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,520
We shouldn't allow girls like you,
who can't tell the difference

784
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,350
between a chocolate and a cassette.

785
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:38,020
- On the A-side, Chiranjeevi songs.
- Do you want Balakrishna on the B-side?

786
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,720
B-side… Leave that to him.

787
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,970
Aunty, there's a phone call for you!

788
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,980
Bava is always negative. Listen to me.

789
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:27,560
- It's just some sound.
- What happened, Jikki?

790
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,230
It slipped out of my hand.

791
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:30,760
It's okay if it slipped
out of your hand, ma'am.

792
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,550
You will be in trouble if your leg slips.

793
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,550
A phone call has come.

794
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,260
Aunty, a phone call for you.

795
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:37,510
I can't hear you, dear. Come in.

796
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:39,060
Where are you, Aunty?

797
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,060
Here…

798
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,350
A phone call for you.

799
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,050
- Turn this side.
- Who are you talking to, my son?

800
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:57,300
My sister.

801
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,560
Well, the phone has been
dead for the last three days.

802
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,600
Who are you talking to?

803
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:04,810
That's why, I'm not able to hear anything.

804
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:07,760
Sister, I will call you later,
the phone is dead.

805
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:10,150
Thank you.

806
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:16,430
My parents are looking
for potential matches for me.

807
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:20,510
- Let them.
- Tomorrow they are coming home to see me.

808
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:24,600
- Let them.
- Aren't you scared, man?

809
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:28,260
Not at all.
Unless they see a few matches,

810
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:29,890
how will your father know my specialty?

811
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,860
Yeah, big specialty.

812
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,760
You are a Kumar Sanu fan.
He is a Kishore Kumar fan.

813
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,310
I'm getting killed for playing
the orchestra between both of you.

814
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:38,390
Really?

815
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,360
Then, let's do something.

816
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,190
This time, I will play the
chorus to your orchestra, okay?

817
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,690
- What?
- It means…

818
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,260
Mr. Pankaj, your…

819
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,110
Everyone is saying that
the girl is good.

820
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:52,270
- If this match works out…
- Greetings.

821
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,640
He is Mr. Chandi Das, and his
son is in the diamond business.

822
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:56,230
Your daughter is like gold…

823
00:55:56,430 --> 00:56:00,390
They make a perfect match. That's
why I approached them for an alliance.

824
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:02,440
Thanks for that.

825
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,060
After the priest has said okay,
what questions will I have?

826
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,220
We will come to see
the girl on an auspicious day.

827
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:09,480
- Okay.
- The priest manages every

828
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,310
celebration in our family.

829
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:13,970
His word is as trustworthy as an ISI mark.

830
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:17,110
While he performs the puja in the temple,
I hear the song belongs to you.

831
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,350
Nothing like that.

832
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:27,020
Jikki, you said that you would persuade
your father to arrange our marriage.

833
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,860
What happened?

834
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:32,100
This won't work out.
Let's get married first,

835
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,230
and then we can convince him.

836
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,110
Once we're married,
he'll have no choice but to accept it.

837
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,890
This cassette
doesn't belong to him, madam.

838
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,690
Yeah, from now on, the girl also
doesn't belong to him. Let's go, Son.

839
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:45,390
What kind of match
did your father arrange?

840
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,860
Such trouble for this match?

841
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:58,760
I went to hear Bhagavatam at the temple…

842
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:01,180
and her story was exposed. It's shameful!

843
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,890
While everyone respects me,
she dragged me down.

844
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:06,940
Why is Jikki being
blamed for this, Uncle?

845
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,430
She is as innocent
as a queen in a deck of cards.

846
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,770
It's him who messed everything up.

847
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,760
This is a matter between two families.

848
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:16,640
I will not tolerate any
outsider intervening.

849
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,150
Look how your son is behaving!

850
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,230
Forget their words.

851
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,610
I will look after Jikki
like my own daughter.

852
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:25,520
Please allow them to get married, brother.

853
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,890
How can we agree?
He doesn't even have a job.

854
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:34,860
- It's all because of this stupid phone.
- Correct, Uncle.

855
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:36,220
Hello…

856
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,980
Excuse me. I'm calling from
the Income Tax Department.

857
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,690
- Can I speak to Mr. Bachchan, please?
- Dorababu!

858
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:44,610
It's cards playing in the…

859
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:45,720
Hey, stop.

860
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:47,440
Uncle, this guy is talking in English.

861
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:48,940
Yes?

862
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,020
This is the Deputy Commissioner
of the Income Tax Department.

863
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:54,610
Mr. Bachchan's suspension
has been lifted. Please inform him.

864
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:56,230
Okay.

865
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,140
Bachchan, it's your call.

866
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:00,680
You said the phone was stupid, right?
Tell them that I'm not here.

867
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,020
You need to take this call.

868
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,180
- Yes, Bachchan speaking.
- Your suspension has been lifted.

869
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:08,150
Please return
and resume your duties urgently.

870
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:10,690
- Sure, sir. Thank you.
- Welcome.

871
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,550
You tell them yourself.

872
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,800
It's from the Income Tax Department.

873
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,510
My suspension has been lifted, Dad.

874
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:18,220
They asked me to join back immediately.

875
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,890
What great news, Son!

876
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,610
What do you say now?

877
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,010
Mr. Bachchan.
You must've heard the name.

878
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,560
You raised your daughter
with so much love.

879
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,980
I will cherish
and care for her as my life.

880
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:35,180
Please allow us to get married.

881
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:39,860
Alright.

882
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,060
Let's set the date.

883
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,440
Congratulations, dear!

884
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,390
- Uncle, have you gone mad?
- Keep the phone aside.

885
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,260
Brother…

886
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:54,060
What's happening, dude?

887
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:56,970
He has ruined your chances, bro.

888
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,860
A big fair in the girl's beauty

889
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,560
And Bappi Lahiri in Bachchan's voice

890
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:49,720
Just at a gesture
Disco starts playing

891
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:52,510
And the concert won't stop till dawn

892
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:55,610
A love duet
In Telugu, Tamil, and Hindi

893
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,140
The drop of sweat will play to the music

894
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:10,190
Eyelids should beat like the drums

895
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:13,020
My bangles will sing a ghazal

896
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:15,980
The noise of the cot should play a chorus

897
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,350
The audience will throw Jasmine flowers

898
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,220
Once more, more, more…

899
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,270
Close the door, door, door…

900
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:27,680
When kissing, the surrounding villages
Play on the mic

901
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:30,350
Till the sun rises

902
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:33,480
A big fair in the girl's beauty

903
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,390
And Bappi Lahiri in Bachchan's voice

904
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:10,850
Why the shyness on your pink cheeks?

905
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:16,550
Since you hid sharpness
In your sharp looks

906
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:22,940
When I pinch your waistline
Fingers learn music

907
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:26,140
And we get into…
Pillow business under full moon

908
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:30,180
Jhanak! Jhanak! Jhanak!
And we play Nattuvangam

909
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:40,770
Eyelids should beat like the drums

910
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:43,730
My bangles will sing a ghazal

911
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:46,690
The noise of the cot should play a chorus

912
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:49,100
The audience will throw Jasmine flowers

913
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:52,050
Once more, more, more…

914
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:54,980
Close the door, door, door…

915
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:58,260
When kissing, the surrounding villages
Play on the mic

916
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,890
Till the sun rises

917
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:04,300
A big fair in the girl's beauty

918
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,480
And Bappi Lahiri in Bachchan's voice

919
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:50,560
How you hold my life
At ransom at the edge of your sari

920
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:56,520
While I hold with my fingers
You are the world for me

921
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:02,800
I smelt like an ice cream
Filled with youth in mid-summer

922
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:05,600
Let the heat be cold
And Varanda hold it

923
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:09,550
Hug me and sing an Asha Bhosle tune

924
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:20,310
Eyelids should beat like the drums

925
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,190
My bangles will sing a ghazal

926
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:26,180
The noise of the cot should play a chorus

927
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:28,440
The audience will throw Jasmine flowers

928
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:31,610
Once more, more, more…

929
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,430
Close the door, door, door…

930
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,810
When kissing, the surrounding villages
Play on the mic

931
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:40,480
Till the sun rises

932
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:43,800
A big fair in the girl's beauty

933
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:46,720
And Bappi Lahiri in Bachchan's voice

934
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:53,980
Congratulations.

935
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:58,100
You are the first officer to join
on promotion after a suspension.

936
01:03:58,310 --> 01:03:59,270
Thank you, sir.

937
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:01,930
You must conduct
an income tax raid on a big shot.

938
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:03,690
My wedding is in four days, sir.

939
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:06,640
The raid can be completed in a day.
You can return by the evening.

940
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:08,140
- Please try to understand, sir.
- Bachchan!

941
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:10,510
You've been taken back
into the department for this raid only.

942
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:12,940
I will assign the team. Get ready.

943
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,760
- By the way, sir, who should I raid?
- It's highly confidential.

944
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:17,760
They said they would inform me
an hour before informing you.

945
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:20,600
No problem, sir. For me,
the work is important. Not the name.

946
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:30,010
The king has been checkmated, Tayaramma!

947
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,300
- Hello?
- Delhi Party Office.

948
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:35,270
So, what's the news from Delhi?

949
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:37,890
Bad news. They are not
giving the MLA ticket to your brother.

950
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:40,560
- Are you in your senses?
- Yes.

951
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,760
I'm an MP overseeing seven MLAs.

952
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:46,180
Party offices could be burnt down
if anyone messes with me.

953
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:48,760
You're overestimating
yourself, Mr. Jaghayya.

954
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:52,100
An anonymous person came
to your brother's public meeting…

955
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:54,400
and tried to burn
everything down with petrol.

956
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:56,520
And you couldn't do anything about it.

957
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:59,770
How can you threaten us in Delhi?
Goodbye.

958
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,230
What happened at your meeting?

959
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:07,770
Brother…

960
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:11,850
What happened at your meeting that night?

961
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,060
Brother…

962
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:23,020
I want him in front of me within
the next hour, no matter where he is.

963
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:25,860
Why are you just standing there? Go now!

964
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,050
We have our wedding
in the next four days--

965
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:39,300
I will come back in two days.

966
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,510
I'm scared.

967
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:42,940
Come on, silly girl.

968
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:46,390
Every girl gets butterflies
before their wedding.

969
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,050
At times like this, you should…

970
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:52,060
- Did it come down?
- You will come, right?

971
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:53,390
You will soon find out.

972
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:58,230
We searched everywhere, sir.
We couldn't find him.

973
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,600
I don't know. I need him.

974
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:02,310
We looked for him in the market
as well, brother. He is not there…

975
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:04,640
I don't want to hear anything. I need him!

976
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:06,390
We scanned the entire town,
brother. He is not to be seen.

977
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,980
I need him!

978
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:14,440
Brother, it seems
his name is Bachchan.

979
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,180
He is an income tax officer.

980
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:19,010
He has been singing in
an orchestra since he was suspended.

981
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:23,810
Coward.

982
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:26,390
How did you let him go
after what happened?

983
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,900
Had he been in front of me…

984
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,060
He is the guy.

985
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:05,060
While we are searching
for him all around…

986
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:09,060
why did he walk in himself
along with his battalion?

987
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,110
Sambashiva…

988
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:12,650
isn't it a miracle?

989
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:15,730
While we're searching for him all around…

990
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:21,430
why did he walk in
along with his battalion?

991
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,510
We're from the
Income Tax Department.

992
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,390
And a raid is scheduled to begin
at your house in a few minutes.

993
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:31,900
Furthermore, all our names are
registered at Ayakar Bhavan, New Delhi.

994
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:36,060
Any harm to us will come
at a steep cost to you.

995
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,940
Officers, please announce
the rules before we start the raid.

996
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,190
Until the raid is completed,
no one should leave the house.

997
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:43,650
And those outside cannot enter.

998
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:47,650
The searches will occur
daily from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

999
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:49,690
You won't be disturbed after that.

1000
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:52,390
Only female staff
will question the women.

1001
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:55,440
All your phones will be disconnected.
We will only use them when necessary.

1002
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:57,520
- Sujata Garu and team…
- Yes, sir!

1003
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,930
Please go in and speak to the ladies.

1004
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,970
Once they indicate they are comfortable,
let us know, and then we will enter.

1005
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:01,940
Okay, sir.

1006
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:03,060
- Subhash and team…
- Yes, sir!

1007
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:05,600
Close all the doors around us.
No one should enter the house.

1008
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,930
- Okay? Right.
- Okay, sir.

1009
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:08,020
What are you watching, brother?

1010
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,720
Are they really going
to come in and raid us?

1011
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:12,230
Hey, officer. Enough of this circus.

1012
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:17,020
A three-time MP.

1013
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:18,970
A two-time MLA.

1014
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:21,690
And former minister.

1015
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:25,140
That's my history and track record.

1016
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:29,650
Do you know
who you're messing around with?

1017
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:33,480
With five years of service…

1018
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,690
I've conducted 72 raids…

1019
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:40,400
and seized over three billion
in black money.

1020
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,860
I've put an end to
72 "histories" like you.

1021
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:50,060
Maybe you haven't encountered
an officer like me in your career,

1022
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:54,610
but I've dealt with
many politicians like you in mine.

1023
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:58,730
This raid might be new for you,
but not for me.

1024
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:01,300
Sir, the women in the house are
comfortable. We can proceed now.

1025
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,100
Come on, let's start the search.

1026
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,260
Hope the lady officers
have informed you about us.

1027
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,440
We need to know who you all are.

1028
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,800
Please introduce
yourselves with your names.

1029
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:21,690
My name is Prabhavathi,
wife of Muthyam Jaghayya.

1030
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:24,470
My name is Chennakesava.
I'm Muthyam Jaghayya's second brother.

1031
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,180
She is my wife, name…

1032
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:28,050
Sparsha, the touch.

1033
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:30,520
Touch me, and you'll get a shock.

1034
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:32,760
He is my elder brother.
Name…

1035
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:35,140
I know him very well.
How are you, sir?

1036
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:39,760
I'm Srilatha.
Muthyam Sambashiva's better half.

1037
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,680
She is our elder sister…

1038
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,060
Are these all the family members,
or is there anyone else?

1039
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:47,220
There is, and he is coming.

1040
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,060
Who are you?

1041
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:54,800
Presenting, cine hero
Sisindri Chittibabu Garu.

1042
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,020
I haven't seen him in any movie.

1043
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:57,640
I haven't acted in any movie, yet.

1044
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,360
- Officers!
- Yes, sir.

1045
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,360
- You can begin the search.
- Okay, sir.

1046
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,760
It's all a waste of time.
What will we get?

1047
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:07,850
Searching in sir's house is like
putting our hand in God's treasures.

1048
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:08,860
That's true.

1049
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:10,390
My God!

1050
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,270
This bedroom is so huge.

1051
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:16,100
This is the first time I've come
for a raid to such a big house.

1052
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:17,050
Me too.

1053
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:42,140
Muthyam Jaghayya is like a pure gem, sir.

1054
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:44,230
You are unnecessarily
suspecting and insulting him.

1055
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:46,060
You are young.
And you have a bright future.

1056
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:47,640
Why do you want to
mess with these big people?

1057
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:51,800
I want people who work.
Not the ones who give bits of advice.

1058
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:56,180
Please keep your advice
and opinions under Muthyam Jaghayya's…

1059
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,600
Raja… Maharaja…

1060
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,730
You can't find anything here, Raja.

1061
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:07,690
Please, go back, Raja.

1062
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,980
We've searched everywhere, sir.
Couldn't find anything.

1063
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,470
We've searched everything, sir.
Couldn't find anything.

1064
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,470
Neither could we, sir.

1065
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,050
Looks like there is
a lot of heat in your body.

1066
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:24,690
You won't find anything, Raja.

1067
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:27,110
Have some buttermilk and then leave.

1068
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:38,550
We've checked the racks and shelves
in all the rooms, sir.

1069
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:39,890
We couldn't find anything.

1070
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:43,560
Search again,

1071
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:44,760
but this time, look meticulously

1072
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:45,720
- in all the unusual places.
- Okay.

1073
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:49,150
Sir, we searched the backyard,
haystack, and everywhere.

1074
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:50,480
- Yes, sir.
- Everything is clean.

1075
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,610
We didn't find anything.

1076
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:55,310
Check the well, unused vessels,
and old cars if there are any.

1077
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,800
- We need to find something, okay?
- Yes, sir.

1078
01:11:57,890 --> 01:11:58,760
Okay.

1079
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:06,110
It seems like your fire
has died down, officer.

1080
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,730
Should I give you some?

1081
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:15,260
Thanks.

1082
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:19,150
I have a habit of repaying
a hundred times over.

1083
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:21,310
The government pays me a salary
in the thousands,

1084
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:23,550
and I pay it back
by finding black money worth millions.

1085
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:25,110
If you give me the fire…

1086
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:30,680
I will set it ablaze.

1087
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,810
You can say as many dialogues as you want,

1088
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,350
but you won’t find anything here.

1089
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:39,190
Listen to me and go back,

1090
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:40,890
my cute little boy.

1091
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,850
We searched the entire house, sir.
We couldn't find anything.

1092
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:47,110
Yes, sir. They have receipts
for whatever we've found.

1093
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:48,390
We can't seize them--

1094
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:54,690
Govinda! Govinda!

1095
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:57,850
Bachchan is now deflated,

1096
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:01,940
and the people who came with him
turned out to be useless.

1097
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:05,140
Tayaramma, thank you for your blessings.

1098
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:07,270
Why don't you all do something?

1099
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:10,650
Stand in line behind me

1100
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,270
and lick my armpits!

1101
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:18,480
What else can you do,
other than be the lost goat in a carnival?

1102
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,610
There's nothing you can do.

1103
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:23,640
You forgive the goat that lost its way,

1104
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:28,190
and you sacrifice the goat
that made a mistake.

1105
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:30,480
We have enough time for that.

1106
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:32,940
They call it something in Delhi, right?

1107
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:35,310
- Ayyagaru Bhavan.
- It's Ayakar Bhavan, Brother.

1108
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,810
Whatever it is.

1109
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:39,690
Call them…

1110
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:44,900
and tell them that you have come to
the wrong address, and made a mistake.

1111
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:50,430
You'll apologize by falling
at Muthyam Jaghayya's feet and then leave.

1112
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:52,440
Call them at once!

1113
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:03,230
- Hello.
- Good afternoon, sir.

1114
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:05,300
- Bachchan speaking, sir.
- Yes?

1115
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,680
We discovered a large amount

1116
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:09,650
of cash and gold
at Mr. Muthyam Jaghayya's house, sir.

1117
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:10,690
Hey!

1118
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:12,770
We'll need more time
to recover everything.

1119
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:13,930
Hey, what are you saying?

1120
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:16,810
- Is everything okay?
- Everything is under control, sir.

1121
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,270
- Is Mr. Jaghayya giving you trouble?
- Not really, sir.

1122
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,980
He and his family are cooperating well.

1123
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:24,300
We are expecting big numbers.
Continue the search.

1124
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,940
- Thank you, sir.
- Take your own time.

1125
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,050
Sure, sir.

1126
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:30,860
What is this new drama?

1127
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:33,270
Have you given up on your life?

1128
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:37,180
Mr. Jaghayya, do you know
why a tongue slips often?

1129
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,220
Because the tongue is wet.

1130
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:44,140
If you were truly honest,
you would never tell us to leave.

1131
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:47,600
You should say,
"Come in if you have the courage."

1132
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:50,980
Similarly, you wouldn’t say,
"You won’t find anything."

1133
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:54,050
You should say,
"There is nothing in this house."

1134
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:59,020
You can hide the treasures,
but you can’t hide your words.

1135
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,270
This guy wants to mess with us.

1136
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:07,610
Show him what happens when
we start messing around, just once.

1137
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:10,770
Throw him out!

1138
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:13,230
Hey!

1139
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:32,900
Sambashiva, take care of this guy.
We'll handle the consequences!

1140
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:29,930
Sambashiva, as your brother mentioned,
fate has a great sense of humor.

1141
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:33,900
You can't escape me,
no matter what you do.

1142
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,390
I'll break every bone in the
body and extract everything.

1143
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:40,150
The one who protects
the borders is not the only soldier.

1144
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:42,520
The one who safeguards
wealth is also a soldier.

1145
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:48,810
I'll show that the Income Tax Department
is as formidable as the Indian Army.

1146
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:55,360
Everyone in the house can breathe
freely for the next five minutes.

1147
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,890
After that, every breath
you take will be accounted for.

1148
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:03,610
It seems the clothes have become tight.
You may want to loosen your buttons.

1149
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,470
You'll be able to breathe.

1150
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:07,550
- Officers…
- Yes, sir.

1151
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:12,900
We will leave after we break
his track record and seal his history.

1152
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:15,140
The true raid is going to start now.

1153
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:17,350
And it's going to be a historic one.

1154
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,900
- Officers…
- Sir.

1155
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:21,440
Get ready to create history.

1156
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:52,860
Please tell me, Mr. Jaghayya.
Why did you call me?

1157
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:55,810
I will pay you half a million.
Stop the raid and leave.

1158
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,800
I won't stop even if you
pay fifty million rupees.

1159
01:18:58,270 --> 01:18:59,480
You madman!

1160
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:02,150
Do you know how many zeros
there are in half a million?

1161
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,730
You can't buy me
by increasing the zeros in the bribe.

1162
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:08,390
You need to bribe to get
your pension after retirement.

1163
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:10,600
Happiness is only in zeros.

1164
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:13,310
Your honesty won't earn you anything.

1165
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:15,720
No matter the zeros in your bank account.

1166
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:17,510
You can only eat off a golden plate,

1167
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:19,640
not the golden plate itself.

1168
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:23,440
A selfish person may enjoy a good meal,

1169
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:25,860
but an honest one will
enjoy a good night's sleep.

1170
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,230
Do you know what will
happen if I break free?

1171
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,600
Break free, Mr. Jaghayya.
I want to see it happen once.

1172
01:19:32,890 --> 01:19:34,010
Please.

1173
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:39,770
Listen, officers. Your boss
isn't agreeing to the truce.

1174
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:41,900
So I'm talking to the soldiers now.

1175
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:45,810
You can keep
whatever gold you find inside.

1176
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:49,430
End the raid and go home.

1177
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:52,310
Go on and live your life.

1178
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,350
- What do we do now?
- What now?

1179
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,190
No, everyone is hesitating.
However, my vote is for Mr. Jaghayya.

1180
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:01,970
Yes, sir.

1181
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:05,640
My father needs heart surgery
that costs 100,000 rupees.

1182
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:07,400
My salary is only 3,500.

1183
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:11,230
I'm afraid his heart might give out
before I can earn enough, sir.

1184
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:12,900
I need to arrange my sister's marriage.

1185
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:14,310
They are asking for a dowry of 200,000.

1186
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:17,300
If dowry isn't a crime,
how can bribery be a crime, sir?

1187
01:20:17,890 --> 01:20:19,470
This is my first raid,
and already they're offering a bribe.

1188
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,470
This is my first raid as well,

1189
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,690
and life will be sorted
after just one raid.

1190
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:24,680
Such opportunities won't come again.

1191
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:26,060
I'm fine with it as well.

1192
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:29,520
This could be my last raid.

1193
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:31,230
I'm retiring next month.

1194
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:34,220
I have never taken a bribe
and won't take one now.

1195
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:36,940
Thank God, one less
person to share the loot.

1196
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:38,060
What about you?

1197
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:40,220
I don’t want to break my back over this.
I'm okay with this.

1198
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:41,190
Okay.

1199
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:43,730
Why should you get rich alone?
I feel the same.

1200
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:44,730
Double okay.

1201
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,100
I feel the same way as well.

1202
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:51,680
Everyone has needs.

1203
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,430
But only a few get opportunities.

1204
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,900
One raid won't change the country.

1205
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:00,720
But it can change our lives.

1206
01:21:01,930 --> 01:21:04,180
That's why we should prosper,
even if we're in the wrong.

1207
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,520
Once we decide to become robbers,
we shouldn't settle for small change,

1208
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,890
we should aim for the treasure chest.

1209
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:10,270
We are prepared,
even if it's two billion.

1210
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:13,600
If the ED offers the same,
and if they seize everything?

1211
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:16,760
I didn't expect this twist.
My goodness! Mr. Bachchan.

1212
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:20,260
Let's seize a substantial
amount and then make our offer.

1213
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:21,800
- What do you guys say?
- Yes, sir.

1214
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:24,140
- Don't leave a single corner untouched.
- Okay, sir.

1215
01:21:24,230 --> 01:21:25,610
Whatever one digs up belongs to them.

1216
01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:27,900
- Whatever one obtains is theirs.
- Yes, sir.

1217
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:30,400
Break down the walls.
Break open the lockers.

1218
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,220
If anyone interferes, break their bones.

1219
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:33,270
Yes, sir!

1220
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:38,970
I spoke to all the officers.

1221
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:40,970
Don't worry. Don't be afraid.

1222
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:42,980
You cannot buy us
with money, Mr. Jaghayya.

1223
01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:47,890
The raid will continue as it was planned.

1224
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:50,900
What we wear isn't just pants
and shirts, but morality and honesty.

1225
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:53,850
What is this nonsense, Dad?

1226
01:21:53,930 --> 01:21:55,180
What is happening, sir?

1227
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,260
- Officers, attack!
- Sir! Yes, sir!

1228
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:01,770
Move away!

1229
01:22:04,930 --> 01:22:07,300
Mr. Ram Murthy and Mr. Subba Rayudu…

1230
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:12,390
The village headmaster
and the postmaster…

1231
01:22:12,890 --> 01:22:14,260
They will be our witnesses.

1232
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:17,050
Sir, we have nothing against you.

1233
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:18,110
You are like a God to us.

1234
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:19,850
- Please forgive us.
- Greetings, brother.

1235
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:25,800
Get up.

1236
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:03,440
Grandma, how are you
related to Muthyam Jaghayya?

1237
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:05,610
Grandma, I'm talking to you.

1238
01:23:18,230 --> 01:23:20,270
Hey, man. Who are you?

1239
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:23,180
- We are from the Income Tax Department.
- Oh, really?

1240
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,400
I thought so.

1241
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:28,890
I knew something like this would
happen to our Jaghayya one day.

1242
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:38,010
Ruined, right?

1243
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:39,810
You've destroyed everything.

1244
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:41,850
Why did you come into
my room in the first place?

1245
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,980
I was happily listening to songs…

1246
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:49,690
and reminiscing about my Sekhar.

1247
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:51,770
And now this has been ruined.

1248
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:54,650
And that wall has grown taller.

1249
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:56,810
- Is Sekhar your husband?
- No.

1250
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,610
My boyfriend.

1251
01:23:58,850 --> 01:24:01,140
He used to look like Nageshwara Rao.

1252
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:02,440
In those days--

1253
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,020
You mentioned that
the wall has gotten taller.

1254
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:04,970
Which wall is that?

1255
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:07,560
You ruined my songs, and now
you're asking me questions? I won't say!

1256
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:09,310
Grandma, please tell me.

1257
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,440
I will tell you only
if I listen to my song.

1258
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,550
- No, please understand.
- What do you mean?

1259
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:15,930
I haven't had any experiences with him.

1260
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:18,360
Won't you allow me
to live in his memories?

1261
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,970
I must listen to that song now.

1262
01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:44,770
That's a good one.

1263
01:24:44,930 --> 01:24:46,350
You did it exactly like Akkineni.

1264
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,150
Can you dance like him as well?

1265
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:51,810
- Dance?
- Don't you want to see the wall?

1266
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:52,760
I do.

1267
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:55,100
And I want to see Akkineni's dance moves.

1268
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:56,550
Come on, dance!

1269
01:25:30,890 --> 01:25:33,260
- You want to see the wall, right?
- Yes.

1270
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:34,600
- Come with me.
- Please.

1271
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:43,810
The wall that covered
my mansion of dreams.

1272
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,760
Should we destroy it?

1273
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,470
- Naresh…
- Sir!

1274
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:07,180
Brother, they should
stop the raid after 6:00 p.m.

1275
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:10,140
- Little brother…
- Yes?

1276
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:14,390
You can't continue
the raid after 6:00 p.m.

1277
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:15,690
Those were your rules.

1278
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:21,230
After 6:00 p.m. means dusk.

1279
01:26:22,350 --> 01:26:24,470
It's the time when demons come out.

1280
01:26:25,270 --> 01:26:28,020
And here, monsters roam freely.

1281
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:31,770
And I'm that monster!

1282
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:35,520
Hiranyakasupundaa!

1283
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:39,800
- Action!
- Son, Prahlada…

1284
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:41,810
Where is your Hari?

1285
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:44,560
Hey, Guruji, I'm asking you,
where is he?

1286
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:49,510
- Hey, Guruji, is your Hari in this?
- Yes.

1287
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:51,060
- Is he there in that pillar?
- Yes.

1288
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:53,680
- Then, show me.
- Don't wait. Kill him!

1289
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,650
Hari!

1290
01:26:57,430 --> 01:26:59,930
- Is Hari in this as well?
- Yes.

1291
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:02,100
Come out, man.

1292
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:04,730
Why isn't he present here?

1293
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:06,180
Where is your Hari?

1294
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,900
Where does he exist?

1295
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:09,440
He may be in this, my lord.

1296
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:11,350
- Are you sure?
- Hundred percent.

1297
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:15,300
Hey, Hari. Come out.

1298
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:18,860
So much money?

1299
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:30,430
Hey, Srimannarayana.
You are truly miraculous.

1300
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:37,260
- Please include this in the account.
- Okay, sir.

1301
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:41,360
All that's here is waste paper.
Where is your Sri Hari?

1302
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:43,300
He might be in that, my Lord.

1303
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:45,220
- Where?
- In the corner, near that wall.

1304
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:46,940
- Then, let's go.
- Please, come.

1305
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:49,690
I will not spare Sri Hari today.

1306
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:56,860
Why did you bring me here?

1307
01:27:57,180 --> 01:28:00,430
- Is your Sri Hari present in this?
- Confirmed, my Lord. He is in this.

1308
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:01,730
Really?

1309
01:28:08,890 --> 01:28:10,300
Do it again.

1310
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:13,640
Come out, man!

1311
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:16,600
You have such strength, my Lord.
Once more.

1312
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:19,050
Hey, Hari, what are you doing inside?

1313
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:25,510
Why is the "Goddess of Wealth" appearing
when I call for Hari?

1314
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:30,180
Thanks, my Lord.

1315
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:34,300
Take everything out
and add it to the account.

1316
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,440
Yes, sir.

1317
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:45,860
Open your mouth.

1318
01:29:00,730 --> 01:29:03,980
These big officers, who used to fear us,

1319
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:05,480
have entered our house.

1320
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:08,260
If they're left alone,
they might enter our bedrooms next.

1321
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:10,300
Hey, why are you bothered?
Just eat and be quiet.

1322
01:29:11,230 --> 01:29:13,400
Father, how will you produce a film

1323
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:14,940
with me as the hero
if they take all your money?

1324
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:18,140
Of course, the sky is the limit for
our movie, and the budget is unlimited.

1325
01:29:18,230 --> 01:29:19,810
- Well said…
- Have your food.

1326
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:20,760
Okay.

1327
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:24,010
Why did you tell the
officer about the wall, Mom?

1328
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:26,970
Why did you build that
wall so tall, my son?

1329
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:29,060
You oldie, shut up and eat!

1330
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:30,400
We should deal with this Guruji first.

1331
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,940
He and his nonsensical guidance.

1332
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:34,860
Brother, you can say anything to me.

1333
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:39,400
But I won't tolerate it if you say
even a word against my Guruji.

1334
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,300
Look at him, he hasn't even taken off
the crown after all that happened.

1335
01:29:44,930 --> 01:29:50,050
Apparently, Rama Rao Garu used to remove
the crown only at the end of the day.

1336
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,730
I'm the same.
I'll remove it before sleeping.

1337
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,140
Guruji…

1338
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:56,720
Rama Rao Garu might accept
if you remove the crown, but I won't.

1339
01:29:57,310 --> 01:29:59,400
How can you blame us
when you have all the money?

1340
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:02,020
If you don't like it, you can play
the role of a beggar or a dumb man.

1341
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:03,900
Don't act funny during my training.

1342
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:04,940
- Hey, Guruji…
- What?

1343
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:06,940
- If you utter another word--
- Hey!

1344
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:09,520
Stop now!

1345
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:14,110
I want jalebi.

1346
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:16,310
No, Mom. It has sugar.

1347
01:30:16,430 --> 01:30:19,680
If you don't give me jalebi now,
I will have a meeting with him tomorrow.

1348
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:21,100
Mom!

1349
01:30:21,270 --> 01:30:22,690
What a funny family!

1350
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:25,720
How can she eat after all this?

1351
01:30:25,890 --> 01:30:28,220
Because nothing is going to happen
from here on out!

1352
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:36,010
Also, no one should step out
of their rooms tonight, no matter what.

1353
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:41,350
Close the doors tightly and sleep well.

1354
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,190
You eat, Mom.
Just a little bit, okay?

1355
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:18,810
Raja… Maharaja!

1356
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:21,010
Wake up, Raja.

1357
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:26,060
You are sleeping peacefully
after keeping us sleepless.

1358
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:27,440
Very true.

1359
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:30,010
You sleep so well after
taking away all our money.

1360
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:34,050
The seized money.
Tell us where you hid our money.

1361
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:35,860
Why are you talking to him, Brother?

1362
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:38,110
Let's complain to the
department and get him arrested.

1363
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:40,650
Hey, the door is unlocked.

1364
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:43,650
- Oh, no! Where's the money?
- Where is it?

1365
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:45,110
Did Jaghayya steal it?

1366
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:49,060
Sir, there's nothing left
in the place we stored it.

1367
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:50,970
This is unjust, sir.

1368
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:52,510
Why are you not talking?

1369
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:54,720
What can he say after
hiding away all that money?

1370
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:56,390
He made so many exaggerated claims.

1371
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:59,440
What else? Work is worship.
A true form of honesty.

1372
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,650
- And this is his real form.
- Yeah.

1373
01:32:00,770 --> 01:32:04,020
I've been saying this from the beginning.

1374
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:07,520
But you all came here in the name of
a raid. Look at what's happened now.

1375
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:08,890
Moreover, he kept saying,

1376
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:11,060
"You must have heard my name"
once every ten minutes.

1377
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:13,220
Now, he'll get a bad reputation.

1378
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:15,890
Oh, God! Did you take
away my share as well?

1379
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:18,440
What about all my dreams?
All the hopes that I had?

1380
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:21,600
- I thought all those gold coins were mine.
- How could you think they were all yours?

1381
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:23,190
I believed those gold coins were mine.

1382
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:26,480
I had so many dreams. Now the coins
are gone and only the dreams remain.

1383
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:31,350
You didn't listen when he
offered a share in the gold coins…

1384
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,930
Instead, you fell into his trap. Look now!

1385
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:36,190
- Well said.
- Thank you, sir.

1386
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:40,260
Speaking about magic,
do you know any magic?

1387
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,760
You made all the money
disappear overnight.

1388
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:45,400
Looks like you're a magician.

1389
01:32:47,390 --> 01:32:49,550
Speak up.
They are asking, right? Speak.

1390
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:55,360
Hey, where are you going
without giving an answer?

1391
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,260
Will he get imprisoned for life
because of this?

1392
01:32:58,350 --> 01:33:00,930
He could receive a death sentence for
the robbery committed here.

1393
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:02,050
Come.

1394
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:04,390
Where are you going without answering?

1395
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:06,140
Where are you going, man?

1396
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:08,150
We will file a case against
you and put you on the streets.

1397
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:10,560
You will go to Tihar Jail
directly from there.

1398
01:33:10,770 --> 01:33:14,230
We are asking you something.
Answer.

1399
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:23,180
As you all said,
I will perform a magic trick.

1400
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:25,850
I'll demonstrate it right now.

1401
01:33:26,730 --> 01:33:28,520
- It seems he will show something.
- Magic?

1402
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,860
So, let's begin the magic show.

1403
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:38,310
One of the enthusiastic men
should come ahead with a crowbar.

1404
01:34:04,850 --> 01:34:06,430
This will have only two bullets.

1405
01:34:07,140 --> 01:34:08,800
There are so many people here.

1406
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:21,220
The first bullet will hit only one
person, but everyone will be afraid.

1407
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:24,550
The second bullet can hit anyone.

1408
01:34:35,230 --> 01:34:36,730
What is this? Who are they?

1409
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:40,510
Hey, who are all of you?
How did they get here?

1410
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:43,350
Your reaction is not needed now.

1411
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:45,050
We need my action.

1412
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:49,230
Next item, from our department…

1413
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:51,300
Me, me, me.
That enthusiastic young man is me.

1414
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:54,680
Now go there, say the mantra
I told you, and move your hand.

1415
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:00,970
Abracadabra magic.

1416
01:35:01,310 --> 01:35:03,020
Abracadabra magic.

1417
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,110
Abracadabra magic.

1418
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:13,100
Sir, all of our money is here.

1419
01:35:13,310 --> 01:35:14,360
The money, sir.

1420
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:25,690
I thought of thrashing them immediately.

1421
01:35:26,770 --> 01:35:31,810
However, an audience should witness
and understand my capabilities, right?

1422
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:36,680
It's best to watch a cricket match live

1423
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:39,430
instead of reading about it
in the newspaper the next day.

1424
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:43,150
As I mentioned before,
I'm making you an offer.

1425
01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:47,510
Neither the officers who came with me
nor the police will oppose you.

1426
01:35:48,020 --> 01:35:50,020
I alone will stand against you.

1427
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:54,560
If they dare, tell your men to
cross me and take your money away.

1428
01:35:58,310 --> 01:36:01,360
If they dare touch even a penny…

1429
01:36:02,430 --> 01:36:04,140
I swear, I'll abandon everything.

1430
01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:06,300
- What is he saying?
- Oh, my…

1431
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,860
I won't fight your men in the shadows.

1432
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:10,850
I'll take them down right
in the heart of your home.

1433
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:12,350
Send them.

1434
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,560
Sir…

1435
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:01,480
Clarity!

1436
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:03,900
I hope you are getting clarity about me.

1437
01:37:04,180 --> 01:37:06,640
Have you got it?
I hope you are getting it.

1438
01:37:07,770 --> 01:37:10,110
Cricket match… live!

1439
01:39:03,890 --> 01:39:05,850
As you said, I'm a magician.

1440
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:08,900
But not a magician who
plays tricks or just talks.

1441
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:10,890
I'm a real magician.

1442
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:21,900
My character is not to
do my duty for the shares.

1443
01:39:22,430 --> 01:39:25,350
I can't sacrifice
my life on the field.

1444
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:27,940
But I won't leave a single rupee behind.

1445
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:29,730
If you want to work with me,

1446
01:39:30,020 --> 01:39:31,110
you must be like me.

1447
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:41,150
What, dear?
You asked me to come so urgently.

1448
01:39:41,230 --> 01:39:43,650
I left Chitralahari on the TV
for this and came.

1449
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:45,680
Light it.

1450
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:49,470
Me, smoking? Are you mad?

1451
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:52,220
Have it once for me, please.

1452
01:39:52,430 --> 01:39:55,140
- I will be caught by its smell.
- You won't be caught.

1453
01:39:55,310 --> 01:39:57,520
Chew a few guava leaves while going home.

1454
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:58,550
Light it.

1455
01:40:00,850 --> 01:40:02,050
This is not an incense stick.

1456
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:03,430
It’s a cigarette. Keep it in your mouth.

1457
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:12,020
Nothing will happen.
Inhale in…

1458
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:20,850
I feel his presence next to me
when I inhale this.

1459
01:40:20,980 --> 01:40:23,610
I feel like this cigarette
will become a habit, dear.

1460
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:27,260
I'm unable to live without him.

1461
01:40:29,810 --> 01:40:30,690
Stupid girl.

1462
01:40:30,770 --> 01:40:34,520
Why are you sad when your wedding
is just two days away?

1463
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:37,260
Everything will be alright.
Please don't cry.

1464
01:40:40,390 --> 01:40:43,970
- How are the wedding preparations going?
- Everything is going well.

1465
01:40:44,230 --> 01:40:48,020
Are you okay with having
the wedding in Marwari style?

1466
01:40:48,180 --> 01:40:51,470
How does it matter which style we choose,
as long as they like each other?

1467
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:54,480
If the wedding happens
at an auspicious time, it is good.

1468
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:58,190
Not the wedding.
You should rather prepare for his funeral.

1469
01:40:58,270 --> 01:40:59,190
Shut up!

1470
01:40:59,310 --> 01:41:02,110
Why talk nonsense
when we are preparing for the wedding?

1471
01:41:02,230 --> 01:41:05,270
Set your emotions aside and listen.

1472
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:08,850
I've heard that your Bachchan
led a raid on Muthyam Jaghayya,

1473
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:12,190
taking our headmaster
and postmaster as witnesses.

1474
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:15,400
That's how the news got out.
He is Muthyam Jaghayya.

1475
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:17,890
You must have heard his name.

1476
01:41:18,270 --> 01:41:19,860
I don't know how he will handle your son.

1477
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:26,190
Dad, you worked for him for 30 years.

1478
01:41:26,270 --> 01:41:28,150
Speak to him once.

1479
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:30,690
I'm sure he will listen to you.

1480
01:41:30,810 --> 01:41:32,440
He may listen to your father,

1481
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:34,640
but my son will not listen to anyone.

1482
01:41:34,890 --> 01:41:37,890
You may be sad today but
will be proud of him tomorrow.

1483
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:41,150
Oh, no! What a build-up!

1484
01:41:41,730 --> 01:41:43,810
It’s difficult to deal with them.
Culture-less family.

1485
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:09,550
YANDAMURI VEERENDRANATH
LADY IN THE MOONLIGHT

1486
01:42:19,350 --> 01:42:20,220
Jikki…

1487
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:21,800
How are you, Jikki?

1488
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:27,510
Master, how did you recognize me?

1489
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:31,310
Not just your word…
I can hear your breath as well.

1490
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:34,400
How are you?

1491
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:38,400
I’m drowned in work all day
and floating in your memories at night.

1492
01:42:38,980 --> 01:42:41,020
I'm feeling very scared.

1493
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:43,440
I’m not sure
what they are talking about here.

1494
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:45,650
Oh, my darling,

1495
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:48,270
most people are not afraid of problems

1496
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:49,810
but of rumors and gossip.

1497
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:54,260
Most of the jobless
would be busy with this work.

1498
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:57,810
These guys may be paid to spread rumors
in the future.

1499
01:42:57,930 --> 01:42:59,470
It makes me want to laugh.

1500
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:01,890
You don't know about Muthyam Jaghayya.

1501
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:04,610
They don't know about this Bachchan.

1502
01:43:05,810 --> 01:43:08,190
By the way, Jikki,
what is the Ramayana about?

1503
01:43:08,310 --> 01:43:09,270
Trust.

1504
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:11,520
The trust Sita had that Ram would come.

1505
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:12,800
Then why are you scared?

1506
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:15,850
It is not Sita
who is in Lanka right now. It is Ram.

1507
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:17,730
That's why I'm scared.

1508
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:21,860
Your logic always amazes me.

1509
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:24,310
Isn't this why
I'm head over heels in love with you?

1510
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:26,810
Why don't you shut me up
with your kisses…

1511
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,180
instead of logic?

1512
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:34,550
Jikki, please.

1513
01:44:05,890 --> 01:44:10,300
Hey, cutie pie, who looks like a dove
Wear a bindi and wrap a silk sari

1514
01:44:10,390 --> 01:44:14,680
Team up and wrap me like my own
Tell me where your secret mole is

1515
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:19,190
Hey, cutie pie, who looks like a dove
Wear a bindi and wrap a silk sari

1516
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:23,560
Team up and wrap me like my own
Tell me where your secret mole is

1517
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:28,350
Like all your naughty acts

1518
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:36,640
But told you that you have to wait

1519
01:44:36,730 --> 01:44:40,400
But I came even before you said

1520
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:28,110
Should I wet your shining lips
With all the love?

1521
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:32,550
Should I spend all my time
In your enchanting beauty?

1522
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:37,100
Should I dive into the depths
Of the ocean of your beauty?

1523
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:41,310
Should I touch the clouds of the music?

1524
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:44,150
Should I signal you…

1525
01:45:45,810 --> 01:45:48,480
And raise hopes in you?

1526
01:45:50,390 --> 01:45:54,550
When the wind makes the noise

1527
01:45:54,770 --> 01:45:58,360
Should I be the reason for you
To change the clothes?

1528
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:50,390
Should I sneak in like
A thief in the evening?

1529
01:46:50,930 --> 01:46:54,720
Should I play pillow fights
With your youth?

1530
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:59,300
Should I hug the beauty
With the speed of love?

1531
01:46:59,810 --> 01:47:03,560
Should I quench the thirst
In your thoughts?

1532
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:06,300
Should I shed inhibitions…

1533
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:10,980
Under the blue sky?

1534
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:16,520
Should I sing a tune in our union

1535
01:47:16,810 --> 01:47:20,230
And give you a new thrill?

1536
01:48:03,430 --> 01:48:05,390
What happened, Aunty?
You didn't ask for coffee today.

1537
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:07,180
Are you not feeling well?

1538
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:09,690
Aunty?

1539
01:48:10,270 --> 01:48:11,310
Aunty?

1540
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:14,110
Aunty?

1541
01:48:14,350 --> 01:48:15,350
Sambashiva!

1542
01:48:17,770 --> 01:48:20,020
Why did you do this, Mom?

1543
01:48:20,230 --> 01:48:22,270
I wanted to see you one more time,

1544
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:25,930
and now you've made it so
that I'll never see you again!

1545
01:48:26,890 --> 01:48:28,850
- You should cry as well.
- I can't produce any tears.

1546
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:30,480
You inherit property only if you cry.

1547
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:36,510
I can’t bear this, Aunty!

1548
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:41,360
You wanted to see the necklace
you wear around my neck. Meanwhile…

1549
01:48:42,980 --> 01:48:46,610
You said your "seven-week ornaments"
belong to me.

1550
01:48:47,350 --> 01:48:49,300
You gave me your mother's name

1551
01:48:49,430 --> 01:48:52,970
and promised to transfer
the rice mill to me.

1552
01:48:53,060 --> 01:48:54,860
And then you left abruptly, Mom!

1553
01:48:56,430 --> 01:48:58,390
They aren't mourning her demise

1554
01:48:58,640 --> 01:48:59,760
but the loss of the properties.

1555
01:48:59,930 --> 01:49:01,430
- Guruji!
- Sishya.

1556
01:49:02,230 --> 01:49:05,270
It’s time to showcase my training
and your timing.

1557
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,770
The more you cry,
the more properties you get.

1558
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:09,550
Just say "action," Guruji,

1559
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:10,800
and I’ll deliver
an Oscar-worthy performance.

1560
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:11,760
Action.

1561
01:49:11,850 --> 01:49:13,300
Grandma!

1562
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:15,180
Grandma!

1563
01:49:15,310 --> 01:49:17,270
Oh, my grandma…

1564
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:21,430
Oh, my grandma…

1565
01:49:21,730 --> 01:49:25,690
You always said you’d
give me millions to make a movie.

1566
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:30,260
And now we have to face
your sudden death, Grandma!

1567
01:49:32,770 --> 01:49:36,020
You joined the stars before
seeing my stardom, Grandma.

1568
01:49:36,270 --> 01:49:40,900
You called "pack up"
before I could put on my makeup, Grandma!

1569
01:49:46,850 --> 01:49:49,140
- Get up, Sishya…
- Your mother--

1570
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:51,980
Mothers give birth to their children.

1571
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:54,480
My mother gave me life through her death.

1572
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:56,640
It's time for you to stop this raid.

1573
01:49:56,770 --> 01:49:57,650
Bad luck.

1574
01:49:57,770 --> 01:50:02,730
Once the doctor confirms it,
pack your bags.

1575
01:50:05,270 --> 01:50:09,520
Leave the sealed bags behind
and go from here.

1576
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:15,560
Moreover, the party workers, leaders…

1577
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:19,860
ministers, VIPs…

1578
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:27,100
and even the CM will be arriving soon.

1579
01:50:32,230 --> 01:50:34,900
Grandma!

1580
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:41,010
You wanted to see me on the silver
screen even if it meant selling your gold.

1581
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:44,850
Wake up, Grandma!

1582
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:48,550
Please look at your grandson once,
Grandma.

1583
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:52,050
Wake up, Grandma!

1584
01:50:52,270 --> 01:50:54,440
Wake up, Grandma!
Wake up!

1585
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:57,610
Wake up, Grandma!
Wake up!

1586
01:50:57,730 --> 01:51:01,440
Wake up!
Wake up, Grandma!

1587
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:06,350
Grandma woke up!

1588
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:08,510
Doctor, it's a medical miracle.

1589
01:51:08,730 --> 01:51:11,980
Grandma woke up!
Doctor, it's a medical miracle.

1590
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:14,230
Daddy, Grandma is alive.

1591
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:18,850
It was a cardiac arrest,

1592
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:21,400
but CPR was done at the right time.
Who did this?

1593
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:24,690
My disciple struck her heart
at just the right moment and revived her.

1594
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:40,050
Truly, your mother is extraordinary.

1595
01:51:40,270 --> 01:51:41,310
Not just for you, but for many others,

1596
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:45,110
as she allowed this raid
to continue and potentially saved lives.

1597
01:51:46,270 --> 01:51:47,230
She's a great woman.

1598
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:54,270
My heartfelt condolences to you
on your mother's recovery.

1599
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:56,050
- Officers…
- Yes, sir!

1600
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:57,800
- Get back to work!
- Okay, sir!

1601
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:03,440
I told him to bring a character to life,
but he brought the dead back to life.

1602
01:52:03,770 --> 01:52:06,270
If your mother is alive today,
it's solely due to my training.

1603
01:52:06,850 --> 01:52:07,720
Yes, sir.

1604
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:10,100
At least increase my
salary from this month, sir.

1605
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:12,260
Expenses are at an all-time high--

1606
01:52:12,890 --> 01:52:15,470
- Grandma…
- What happened, Aunty?

1607
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:19,310
How did I sleep as if I
had taken sleeping pills?

1608
01:52:26,890 --> 01:52:28,760
What, Guruji? What’s the news?

1609
01:52:29,770 --> 01:52:31,110
Officer Srinivas reporting, sir.

1610
01:52:31,310 --> 01:52:32,730
Why did you take so long to report?

1611
01:52:32,810 --> 01:52:34,560
Yes, sir. I arrived here three months ago.

1612
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:35,970
Actually, what happened is…

1613
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:00,640
What's wrong, dear?

1614
01:53:00,730 --> 01:53:04,110
While everyone else is celebrating
Karwa Chauth, you're sitting alone.

1615
01:53:04,430 --> 01:53:07,600
If everything had been fine, you would
have been with our son-in-law today.

1616
01:53:08,230 --> 01:53:09,150
It's okay.

1617
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:11,650
They say that when the man is not around,
you can look at his picture.

1618
01:53:11,930 --> 01:53:14,430
But we perform Karwa Chauth for
the husband's well-being.

1619
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:16,850
- How can she--
- He said a picture is enough, right?

1620
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:19,440
We have a picture of our son
at home where he looks like a hero.

1621
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:20,680
Come, I'll show you.

1622
01:53:20,770 --> 01:53:22,690
- Come… Come!
- Come, dear.

1623
01:53:26,930 --> 01:53:28,930
Jikki, what are you doing here?

1624
01:53:29,850 --> 01:53:32,470
Are you thinking of jumping just because
Bachchan didn't come to the wedding?

1625
01:53:32,730 --> 01:53:34,060
Life is precious, Jikki.

1626
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:37,150
They say when God closes a door,
a window opens.

1627
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:39,390
You should look at the windows.

1628
01:53:42,390 --> 01:53:43,470
Would you come with me?

1629
01:53:47,230 --> 01:53:48,230
Where?

1630
01:53:48,350 --> 01:53:49,970
Wherever I go!

1631
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:56,900
Shouldn't we inform your dad before
making such a significant decision?

1632
01:53:56,980 --> 01:53:57,900
No need!

1633
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:00,600
My life, my decision.

1634
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:02,680
Will you come or not?

1635
01:54:07,730 --> 01:54:10,310
I will come anywhere, and do anything.

1636
01:54:10,390 --> 01:54:11,640
Forget about this house.

1637
01:54:11,730 --> 01:54:13,110
I have nothing to do with this world!

1638
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:15,220
Nothing…

1639
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:17,260
You for me

1640
01:54:18,810 --> 01:54:20,520
and me for you. Let's go.

1641
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:24,050
Let's go.

1642
01:54:34,230 --> 01:54:35,360
What the hell!

1643
01:54:36,310 --> 01:54:39,190
You guys have turned my house
into a choultry.

1644
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:41,720
Go ahead…

1645
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:45,610
How many days, sir?

1646
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:46,850
No matter how much we search,
we can't find anything.

1647
01:54:46,930 --> 01:54:47,800
Yes, sir.

1648
01:54:47,890 --> 01:54:49,180
- Hello!
- I need to meet Mr. Bachchan.

1649
01:54:49,270 --> 01:54:50,480
How are you coming in without permission?

1650
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:51,970
Inform him that Jikki is here.

1651
01:54:52,180 --> 01:54:53,140
What brings you here?

1652
01:54:53,230 --> 01:54:55,360
I'm Mr. Bachchan's fiancée.

1653
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:57,270
Sir is inside, ma'am. One minute.

1654
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:06,650
Jikki. What happened?

1655
01:55:07,060 --> 01:55:08,060
Why did you come here?

1656
01:55:11,430 --> 01:55:12,350
Jikki!

1657
01:55:13,890 --> 01:55:16,140
What happened, dear?
Tell me what happened.

1658
01:55:29,730 --> 01:55:31,360
This is the last kiss to Bachchan.

1659
01:55:31,890 --> 01:55:33,930
Tomorrow Dorababu
will get his first kiss.

1660
01:55:34,230 --> 01:55:35,770
First kiss…

1661
01:55:35,890 --> 01:55:37,010
What happened, dear?

1662
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:38,730
You can't come.

1663
01:55:39,390 --> 01:55:41,050
I can't stop myself from coming.

1664
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:44,640
Today is our first Karva Chauth.

1665
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:47,060
Everyone sees the moon.

1666
01:55:48,230 --> 01:55:49,940
I came to see you.

1667
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:56,520
What should I do now?

1668
01:55:56,640 --> 01:56:00,220
My heart goes mad without your company…

1669
01:56:00,390 --> 01:56:01,350
Dorababu.

1670
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:02,680
Yes, darling.

1671
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:04,060
Take it.

1672
01:56:04,390 --> 01:56:05,300
Silly girl!

1673
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:07,440
Where's the strainer?
The son-in-law is here.

1674
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:19,640
My wedding is the day after tomorrow.
You should come.

1675
01:56:19,730 --> 01:56:20,610
Not possible.

1676
01:56:22,270 --> 01:56:25,310
My wedding is on the same day
and at the same time.

1677
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:31,550
Should I leave?

1678
01:56:31,810 --> 01:56:34,190
You can leave without worry.
I'll come as well.

1679
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:45,390
Who are you, dear?

1680
01:56:47,230 --> 01:56:48,400
It's me, Uncle.

1681
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:51,020
I'm Mr. Pandey's daughter,
who used to work with you.

1682
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:54,300
I'm getting married
to Bachchan the day after tomorrow.

1683
01:56:55,770 --> 01:56:57,150
I came here because
today is Karva Chauth--

1684
01:56:57,310 --> 01:56:58,400
It's okay, dear.

1685
01:56:58,890 --> 01:56:59,930
This is your home.

1686
01:57:00,270 --> 01:57:02,650
You can come and go anytime you want.

1687
01:57:03,140 --> 01:57:04,930
But your husband might not agree.

1688
01:57:05,270 --> 01:57:06,560
He might talk about rules.

1689
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:08,850
No one really follows rules here anyway.

1690
01:57:09,180 --> 01:57:10,970
Jikki, please leave now.

1691
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:16,060
You once sent me a nose pin as a
gift in my childhood, with my father.

1692
01:57:16,390 --> 01:57:19,680
Can you please send my husband
to my wedding, the day after tomorrow?

1693
01:57:20,140 --> 01:57:21,100
Please.

1694
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:22,600
You silly girl.

1695
01:57:22,890 --> 01:57:26,390
This time, I'll send him along
with a marriage necklace.

1696
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:32,400
May you have a blessed
and long married life.

1697
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:44,640
I'm so fortunate, Tayaramma…
Tayaramma…

1698
01:57:44,890 --> 01:57:49,890
I'm very happy, Tayaramma…
Tayaramma…

1699
01:57:50,020 --> 01:57:54,440
I found him easily, Tayaramma…
Tayaramma…

1700
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,480
Well, Mr. Jaghayya, you sing very well.

1701
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,940
Anyway, from tomorrow you'll
have to make a living by singing.

1702
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:01,470
Meet me after the raid is over.

1703
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:03,650
I'll give you a chance in our band, okay?

1704
01:58:04,890 --> 01:58:08,550
And don't forget to bring your Tayaramma
with you. You can sing a duet with her.

1705
01:58:08,730 --> 01:58:10,610
A duet. Is that okay?

1706
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:17,970
Why are you talking
to a stranger in the middle of the night?

1707
01:58:18,100 --> 01:58:19,850
I won't like this after our wedding.

1708
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:21,010
Let's go!

1709
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:21,970
Where?

1710
01:58:22,060 --> 01:58:24,560
- Home. Where else?
- Why home? I thought we both…

1711
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:26,510
Yes, we both are going to my house.

1712
01:58:26,730 --> 01:58:28,940
Are you compromising in life, Jikki?

1713
01:58:29,180 --> 01:58:30,600
You are confused.

1714
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:34,190
If you hurry, you can come on the bike.
Otherwise, you'll have to walk.

1715
01:58:34,810 --> 01:58:37,020
We have a long way to go. I'm leaving.

1716
01:58:38,060 --> 01:58:39,480
How can I go that far by walking?

1717
01:58:39,850 --> 01:58:42,300
Keep the cash account
and gold account separately.

1718
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:44,150
- Check.
- After that, I'll tell you what to do.

1719
01:58:44,230 --> 01:58:45,110
Okay, sir.

1720
01:58:49,890 --> 01:58:53,180
Is that phone call for you or me?

1721
01:58:53,270 --> 01:58:55,560
Even if it's for you,
please give it to me.

1722
01:58:55,730 --> 01:58:57,650
I'll talk in your presence.

1723
01:59:00,770 --> 01:59:02,810
What? Jikki, is it?

1724
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:04,980
Oh, Jikki!

1725
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:09,940
Why did you guys go there?

1726
01:59:11,810 --> 01:59:12,690
Hey!

1727
01:59:14,270 --> 01:59:17,520
Not right. He's just doing his duty.

1728
01:59:17,980 --> 01:59:19,020
What did you say?

1729
01:59:19,310 --> 01:59:21,520
You’re also doing your duty, are you?

1730
01:59:21,730 --> 01:59:24,190
Why should I get involved?
Sort it out yourselves.

1731
01:59:24,270 --> 01:59:25,150
Here.

1732
01:59:26,980 --> 01:59:30,270
Bachchan, if you stay there,
we'll stay here.

1733
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:32,560
If you leave that house within the
next 24 hours, we'll leave this house.

1734
01:59:33,270 --> 01:59:35,560
You don't have much time. Think about it!

1735
01:59:40,310 --> 01:59:41,560
Party workers.

1736
01:59:42,890 --> 01:59:44,300
In English, they also call them fans.

1737
01:59:45,730 --> 01:59:47,360
It's madness.

1738
01:59:48,310 --> 01:59:50,400
They're obsessed with me.

1739
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:52,220
Crazy enough…

1740
01:59:53,850 --> 01:59:55,600
to kill for me.

1741
01:59:57,930 --> 01:59:59,600
Twenty-four hours.

1742
02:00:04,730 --> 02:00:10,020
Tayaramma, you're miraculous.

1743
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:46,440
Who is that?

1744
02:00:46,730 --> 02:00:48,650
You’ll get to know when I come inside.

1745
02:00:48,850 --> 02:00:50,180
Say what you want from there.

1746
02:00:55,230 --> 02:00:57,230
- Matchbox.
- Go.

1747
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:25,680
Who are you, man?

1748
02:01:25,930 --> 02:01:29,600
If we keep introductions, it will take
seven and a half hours, you dumbo.

1749
02:01:29,770 --> 02:01:31,980
I was very busy. I came
because my brother asked me to come.

1750
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:36,260
Simply speaking, I’m the Youth Yuvaraj
sent by Mass Maharaaj.

1751
02:01:38,140 --> 02:01:40,930
Presenting today’s entertainment
by Siddhu Jonnalagadda,

1752
02:01:41,020 --> 02:01:45,860
Junior Income Tax Officer,
Ayakar Bhavan, Hyderabad, 500032.

1753
02:01:58,850 --> 02:02:02,720
Brother breaks the bones
and I break the nerves.

1754
02:02:14,850 --> 02:02:18,350
What are you guys eating?
You guys look like double-decker buses.

1755
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:20,390
My shoulder was going
to dislocate, sister.

1756
02:02:21,730 --> 02:02:25,190
Double-decker buses
should be parked on the road.

1757
02:02:25,480 --> 02:02:28,940
If they enter the house
and park here, we won't spare them.

1758
02:02:59,390 --> 02:03:01,680
Hey, according to the
constitution of this country,

1759
02:03:01,770 --> 02:03:03,730
indulging in black money
is a punishable offense.

1760
02:03:03,810 --> 02:03:06,440
If I do not eradicate this
kind of cancer from society,

1761
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:07,900
the nation will go into depression,

1762
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:10,360
and I will have to resign
from my bloody designation.

1763
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:11,650
How did I say, dude?

1764
02:03:11,890 --> 02:03:12,850
You didn't understand?

1765
02:03:13,020 --> 02:03:15,150
Try to understand.
Meanwhile, I have to make a call.

1766
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:31,360
Even if that call is for you,
give it to me. Please.

1767
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:36,610
Hey, bro.

1768
02:03:37,140 --> 02:03:39,930
What? You broke their arms and legs?

1769
02:03:40,180 --> 02:03:42,010
I hope you haven't killed them yet.

1770
02:03:42,430 --> 02:03:44,800
What's that?
You're planning to kill them now?

1771
02:03:45,140 --> 02:03:48,550
Well, I'm staying out of it.
Sort it out among yourselves.

1772
02:03:50,930 --> 02:03:52,350
Hey, Jaggu Kaka!

1773
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:54,110
Your BP will rise
once you hear what I'm saying.

1774
02:03:54,180 --> 02:03:55,800
So keep the tablets next to you.

1775
02:03:56,020 --> 02:03:59,230
I have thrashed the men
sent by you in ten minutes flat.

1776
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:01,980
If you have more, send them.

1777
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:03,520
I will stay here,
and Bachchan will stay there.

1778
02:04:03,810 --> 02:04:06,400
If it itches down under,
you should scratch your top.

1779
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:08,730
We’ll both be on duty,
keeping a close eye on you going forward!

1780
02:04:09,810 --> 02:04:11,060
The wedding is planned here.

1781
02:04:11,140 --> 02:04:13,800
All the stuff should be set
in its own place. Do it quickly!

1782
02:04:25,270 --> 02:04:27,360
Excuse me, Jikki madam.
If you don't mind, please.

1783
02:04:27,640 --> 02:04:31,140
- Do you have any sisters?
- No, why?

1784
02:04:31,230 --> 02:04:32,440
Just fitting the map into the gap.

1785
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:35,020
The younger brother's procession
at the elder brother's wedding.

1786
02:04:35,890 --> 02:04:39,010
Check and search. Find someone for me.

1787
02:04:39,100 --> 02:04:42,350
I don’t have many requirements.
If she is shorter than me, that's enough.

1788
02:04:42,730 --> 02:04:45,690
Please, if you don't mind.
Thank you. Take care.

1789
02:04:53,020 --> 02:04:55,360
It seems Uncle is upset because he doesn't
have a younger daughter.

1790
02:04:57,230 --> 02:04:58,190
Buddies.

1791
02:04:58,850 --> 02:05:00,140
They also call them friends in English.

1792
02:05:00,850 --> 02:05:03,760
If you have fans, I have friends

1793
02:05:04,310 --> 02:05:06,650
who are willing to give their lives

1794
02:05:07,060 --> 02:05:10,520
or take a life for me if needed.

1795
02:05:22,390 --> 02:05:25,390
You're playing with fire
by locking the lion in its den.

1796
02:05:26,310 --> 02:05:29,610
The moment I step out of this
house, you'll have to deal with it.

1797
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:31,510
Why wait for one day?
You can step out now.

1798
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:36,690
Use your position,
power, might, and people

1799
02:05:36,770 --> 02:05:38,730
to stop me if you dare.

1800
02:05:39,060 --> 02:05:40,440
I will.

1801
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:44,060
I will give you hell.

1802
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:47,520
If you do that,
I will resign and sit at home.

1803
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:50,350
Or else, I will ensure that
you sit in Tihar Jail.

1804
02:06:07,020 --> 02:06:10,190
I don't think it is correct
to send him out currently, sir.

1805
02:06:10,430 --> 02:06:13,350
You can’t break into the snake’s den
unless it comes out.

1806
02:06:13,430 --> 02:06:17,220
We can’t get the people in the household
to talk unless he steps out.

1807
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:41,900
Sir, the CM is calling you inside.

1808
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:45,020
Hey, tell him to come out.
Today, I want to make or break things.

1809
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:47,110
Bloody hell…

1810
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:49,970
What's up, Jaghayya?

1811
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:53,180
Everything alright?

1812
02:06:53,270 --> 02:06:55,150
Why would I come here
if everything were alright?

1813
02:06:55,730 --> 02:06:58,810
The Income Tax Department
is governed by the central government.

1814
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:00,510
You would know the rules
if you were educated.

1815
02:07:01,020 --> 02:07:03,440
The guy in the ruling party
doesn't follow the rules.

1816
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:05,470
Call him immediately
and stop all the raids!

1817
02:07:21,180 --> 02:07:23,350
- Hello.
- Am I speaking to Mr. Bachchan?

1818
02:07:23,480 --> 02:07:25,230
Yes, Mr. Bachchan speaking.

1819
02:07:25,310 --> 02:07:27,110
This call is from the CM's office.

1820
02:07:27,270 --> 02:07:29,360
The Chief Minister would
like to speak with you.

1821
02:07:29,560 --> 02:07:30,770
The Chief Minister?

1822
02:07:31,270 --> 02:07:32,650
Yes. One second.

1823
02:07:33,560 --> 02:07:34,440
Sir.

1824
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:39,180
Is it true that raids are being conducted
at Muthyam Jaghayya's house?

1825
02:07:39,270 --> 02:07:40,150
You…

1826
02:07:40,230 --> 02:07:41,110
Yes, sir.

1827
02:07:41,180 --> 02:07:43,180
Stop them immediately and leave at once.

1828
02:07:43,930 --> 02:07:46,430
Sorry, sir. Our department operates under
the authority of the central government.

1829
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:48,550
You are challenging the Chief Minister.

1830
02:07:48,980 --> 02:07:50,810
No, sir. I'm reminding you.

1831
02:07:50,890 --> 02:07:53,640
I’m reminding a Chief Minister
of his limitations.

1832
02:07:54,310 --> 02:07:56,270
The state officials, ministers,

1833
02:07:56,350 --> 02:07:58,760
and even the Chief Minister
cannot stop us.

1834
02:07:58,890 --> 02:08:00,800
What do you hope to achieve
by challenging influential people?

1835
02:08:00,980 --> 02:08:02,440
Want to demonstrate
the power of the system

1836
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:04,810
when there's an officer
capable of cleaning it up.

1837
02:08:04,980 --> 02:08:08,230
- If I decide now, immediately--
- Please do.

1838
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:12,730
- Shall we make the PM office call once?
- Hey!

1839
02:08:14,730 --> 02:08:15,610
Shame on you!

1840
02:08:17,060 --> 02:08:19,900
He calls himself a CM? How sad!

1841
02:08:38,060 --> 02:08:39,440
He's like a pure gem, right?

1842
02:09:01,350 --> 02:09:02,220
Hello!

1843
02:09:02,350 --> 02:09:04,680
Hello? Hello…

1844
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:17,520
We won't face any trouble because
of this witness's signature, right?

1845
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:18,970
Your sir is like a God to you, right?

1846
02:09:19,100 --> 02:09:20,470
Why would you have trouble with God?

1847
02:09:24,100 --> 02:09:25,100
- Raju Garu,
- Sir.

1848
02:09:25,180 --> 02:09:27,050
please make three copies of this,
prepare an order, and send them to me.

1849
02:09:27,140 --> 02:09:28,010
Okay, sir.

1850
02:09:49,230 --> 02:09:51,480
- Hello.
- This is the Prime Minister speaking.

1851
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:53,230
Good morning, Mr. Prime Minister.

1852
02:09:53,770 --> 02:09:56,480
Even God cannot save him this time.

1853
02:09:56,680 --> 02:09:58,390
Is there any possibility
to stop the raids?

1854
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:00,640
Yes, sir.
We can stop with your order, sir.

1855
02:10:00,730 --> 02:10:02,730
- Please stop the raids right now.
- Sure, sir.

1856
02:10:02,930 --> 02:10:04,140
When can I expect the orders?

1857
02:10:06,180 --> 02:10:07,050
What do you mean?

1858
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:08,010
PRIME MINISTER

1859
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:09,850
I need written orders from you, sir,

1860
02:10:10,230 --> 02:10:11,360
and I mean it.

1861
02:10:12,770 --> 02:10:14,400
This is my personal order.

1862
02:10:15,390 --> 02:10:18,100
If you’re calling it a personal order,
it suggests there’s something wrong here

1863
02:10:18,390 --> 02:10:20,470
or that you have
a personal connection with me.

1864
02:10:20,640 --> 02:10:23,640
I neither engage in wrongdoing
nor allow anyone to get close to me.

1865
02:10:24,930 --> 02:10:26,640
My office will get in touch
with you later.

1866
02:10:26,890 --> 02:10:30,010
This raid will not cease
until I receive a written order.

1867
02:10:33,890 --> 02:10:35,850
We’ve heard everything you’ve said so far.

1868
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:38,650
Everyone has cooperated with you.

1869
02:10:39,270 --> 02:10:42,900
Please ensure
that no disaster occurs in the house.

1870
02:10:45,730 --> 02:10:47,980
He’s requesting a written order
that we cannot provide.

1871
02:10:48,100 --> 02:10:50,220
- Why is that not possible?!
- Excuse me!

1872
02:10:51,060 --> 02:10:53,060
I also belong to your party.

1873
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:56,060
It's your responsibility to protect me.

1874
02:10:57,640 --> 02:11:01,970
Without me, neither you
nor your party will survive in our area.

1875
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:04,270
Is there any other appointment today?

1876
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:07,060
Delegates have arrived
from Italy to discuss the defense deal.

1877
02:11:07,310 --> 02:11:08,190
Call them.

1878
02:11:08,270 --> 02:11:09,150
Okay, sir.

1879
02:11:39,770 --> 02:11:42,110
Recheck everything
and arrange for the vehicle.

1880
02:11:42,180 --> 02:11:43,050
- Okay, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1881
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:55,190
Hello?

1882
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:57,520
Bachchan's duty here
is a resounding success.

1883
02:11:57,730 --> 02:11:59,480
Now, only the husband’s role remains.

1884
02:11:59,730 --> 02:12:00,810
Are you okay?

1885
02:12:00,930 --> 02:12:03,640
Hello, this is Mr. Bachchan.

1886
02:12:04,850 --> 02:12:08,640
Master, in a few hours,
I will become Mrs. Bachchan.

1887
02:12:13,390 --> 02:12:16,220
Suvvaala Suvvi!

1888
02:12:16,310 --> 02:12:19,020
Suvvi!

1889
02:12:20,890 --> 02:12:27,050
You gave a piercing look

1890
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:34,810
And created a stir with your smile

1891
02:12:35,060 --> 02:12:39,690
Hey, oh, my boy…
Can I trust your word?

1892
02:12:39,770 --> 02:12:44,270
Can praise be given like this?
Can the cheek be pinched?

1893
02:12:44,350 --> 02:12:48,600
Oh my…
You can cause confusion

1894
02:12:48,680 --> 02:12:53,140
And shout at everyone, overcoming shyness

1895
02:13:02,390 --> 02:13:07,010
The white sari with the black border
Has caused chaos

1896
02:13:11,100 --> 02:13:15,510
The white sari with the black border
Has caused chaos

1897
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:19,890
In the smoother waistline
Affairs become turbulent

1898
02:13:19,980 --> 02:13:22,810
Your makeup has ignited a fire

1899
02:13:23,140 --> 02:13:27,640
Hey, oh, my boy…
Can I trust your word?

1900
02:13:27,730 --> 02:13:32,480
Can praise be given like this?
Can the cheek be pinched?

1901
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:36,730
Oh my…
You can cause confusion

1902
02:13:36,810 --> 02:13:40,520
And shout at everyone, overcoming shyness

1903
02:13:41,810 --> 02:13:46,190
The white sari with the black border
Has caused chaos

1904
02:13:46,270 --> 02:13:50,310
In the smoother waistline
Affairs become turbulent

1905
02:13:50,390 --> 02:13:53,510
Your makeup has ignited a fire

1906
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:58,180
Hey, oh, my boy…
Can I trust your word?

1907
02:13:58,270 --> 02:14:03,020
Can praise be given like this?
Can the cheek be pinched?

1908
02:14:03,100 --> 02:14:07,260
Oh my…
You can cause confusion

1909
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:11,100
And shout at everyone, overcoming shyness

1910
02:14:12,020 --> 02:14:16,060
The mole that you hid…
Can I see it?

1911
02:14:16,140 --> 02:14:20,600
Hey, oh, my boy…
You shouldn't ask me everything

1912
02:14:20,680 --> 02:14:24,760
There is heat in the body
So I pinched you with my nail

1913
02:14:24,850 --> 02:14:29,390
Can you stir up a quarrel
Between youth and beauty?

1914
02:14:29,480 --> 02:14:34,060
Fuss in the hearts
Your passion has gotten to me

1915
02:14:34,140 --> 02:14:37,300
Can there be any limits to beauty?

1916
02:15:04,100 --> 02:15:08,100
You came like a bee…
Trying to steal honey from my lips

1917
02:15:08,230 --> 02:15:12,980
Hey, oh, my boy…
You shouldn't ask me everything

1918
02:15:13,060 --> 02:15:17,230
Your nose pin is green…
And you wore something very lovely

1919
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:21,690
Is it fair to hang
With hair like electric wires?

1920
02:15:21,770 --> 02:15:26,400
I’ve seen all the weights
Can I weigh some

1921
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:29,690
Sensitive and solo heart
Here I come

1922
02:15:29,770 --> 02:15:34,230
Hey, oh, my boy…
Can I trust your word?

1923
02:15:34,310 --> 02:15:39,020
Can praise be given like this?
Can the cheek be pinched?

1924
02:15:39,100 --> 02:15:43,300
Oh my…
You can cause confusion

1925
02:15:43,390 --> 02:15:47,100
And shout at everyone, overcoming shyness

1926
02:16:24,390 --> 02:16:26,140
We’ve sealed everything
that was confiscated.

1927
02:16:26,430 --> 02:16:27,430
Please sign here.

1928
02:16:43,480 --> 02:16:45,230
If I’m taking so much from you,

1929
02:16:45,390 --> 02:16:46,680
I should give something back, right?

1930
02:16:47,100 --> 02:16:48,970
That’s why,
here’s a small piece of advice.

1931
02:16:50,180 --> 02:16:52,890
Wealth isn’t just about
accumulating money.

1932
02:16:53,230 --> 02:16:55,230
It also means gaining people
who genuinely care for us.

1933
02:16:56,390 --> 02:16:59,140
None of those you trusted stood by you,

1934
02:16:59,890 --> 02:17:03,180
but these officers,
who are unrelated to me, did.

1935
02:17:04,310 --> 02:17:06,810
In this way, I’ve gained more than you.

1936
02:17:07,140 --> 02:17:08,300
Goodbye.

1937
02:17:30,430 --> 02:17:32,800
How long until my son-in-law arrives?

1938
02:17:32,890 --> 02:17:35,430
He must be tied up with some work.
He will come. Let me go check.

1939
02:17:35,520 --> 02:17:36,770
Okay.

1940
02:17:42,890 --> 02:17:44,300
- This is the best raid of our careers.
- I haven't seen a raid

1941
02:17:44,390 --> 02:17:45,680
like this in my long career.

1942
02:17:45,810 --> 02:17:46,940
Drive faster.

1943
02:17:47,180 --> 02:17:49,430
I need to get married.
My wife is waiting.

1944
02:17:58,930 --> 02:18:00,260
Brother, why did you let him go?

1945
02:18:00,390 --> 02:18:04,390
Sambashiva, fate is very ironic.

1946
02:18:11,020 --> 02:18:14,480
For me, this house
is just like this place.

1947
02:18:17,270 --> 02:18:21,690
He can leave the house,
but not this place.

1948
02:18:31,180 --> 02:18:33,850
The entire country knows
what happened in our house.

1949
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:36,760
We can’t take any action against him here.

1950
02:18:41,600 --> 02:18:44,930
Drive faster! Faster…

1951
02:18:45,020 --> 02:18:47,480
It’s a hassle. Only the name
of the victim gets mentioned,

1952
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:50,140
not the name of the killer.

1953
02:18:53,480 --> 02:18:56,150
That's India's history…

1954
02:18:57,020 --> 02:18:58,730
and future.

1955
02:20:53,930 --> 02:20:55,890
Please continue chanting the mantras.
Meanwhile, he will arrive.

1956
02:20:56,020 --> 02:20:57,270
He'll be here.

1957
02:21:45,310 --> 02:21:46,560
Mr. Suryan,

1958
02:21:46,730 --> 02:21:47,810
the auspicious time is approaching.

1959
02:21:47,890 --> 02:21:49,010
- Time is running out.
- Where is the groom?

1960
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:51,010
- He hasn't arrived yet.
- Sister-in-law, he will come.

1961
02:21:51,350 --> 02:21:52,390
- Dear…
- Come here.

1962
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:53,480
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1963
02:21:53,560 --> 02:21:54,860
Isn’t he here yet? What happened?

1964
02:21:54,930 --> 02:21:57,100
Don't worry. He must've gone
to the office. He'll be here soon.

1965
02:21:57,180 --> 02:21:59,470
- Find out where he is. Go!
- Okay.

1966
02:21:59,560 --> 02:22:00,520
He is coming.

1967
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:38,550
Sir!

1968
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:46,600
Sir.

1969
02:23:12,680 --> 02:23:14,100
Where is the money?

1970
02:24:33,270 --> 02:24:34,650
Confiscate all the money!

1971
02:24:34,770 --> 02:24:36,610
- Go.
- Take all the money out.

1972
02:24:36,680 --> 02:24:37,550
Yes, sir.

1973
02:24:41,730 --> 02:24:42,770
Jikki…

1974
02:24:45,480 --> 02:24:46,650
I'm here!

1975
02:25:45,560 --> 02:25:46,480
Shall we get married?

1976
02:25:57,480 --> 02:25:59,110
Jaghayya threatened to kill me

1977
02:25:59,180 --> 02:26:01,640
if I didn't secure an MLA ticket
for his brother.

1978
02:26:01,850 --> 02:26:03,850
What makes him think
that he's so powerful?

1979
02:26:04,100 --> 02:26:06,850
Simple. Financial and muscle power, sir.

1980
02:26:08,600 --> 02:26:10,970
Alright. Let’s hit him with the same.

1981
02:26:11,310 --> 02:26:13,270
- What do you mean?
- An income tax raid.

1982
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:16,800
He can bribe and buy out anyone, sir.

1983
02:26:18,180 --> 02:26:19,930
There's one officer
who can't be bought.

1984
02:26:20,270 --> 02:26:22,400
He is Mr. Bachchan.

1985
02:26:32,600 --> 02:26:35,600
You started from the interval,
and now we’re at the climax.

1986
02:26:35,930 --> 02:26:38,180
Have you ever wondered
what gives me such courage?

1987
02:26:39,810 --> 02:26:42,690
It's honesty. Courage comes from honesty.

1988
02:26:46,270 --> 02:26:47,520
Otherwise, think about it and let me know,

1989
02:26:47,730 --> 02:26:48,860
now that you have plenty of time.

1990
02:26:58,350 --> 02:27:03,350
I’ve heard that a cart
can become a ship and vice versa.

1991
02:27:03,770 --> 02:27:05,980
But I never thought
it could happen in life.

1992
02:27:06,140 --> 02:27:09,390
Give me a cigarette, please.
I’m craving one.

1993
02:27:12,020 --> 02:27:14,770
Wealth isn’t just about
accumulating money.

1994
02:27:15,100 --> 02:27:17,260
It also means gaining people
who genuinely care for us.

1995
02:27:22,640 --> 02:27:27,510
The wealth accumulated has slipped away

1996
02:27:27,930 --> 02:27:32,680
I’ve ended up in a place
I never imagined I’d reach

1997
02:27:32,980 --> 02:27:35,480
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

1998
02:27:35,980 --> 02:27:40,980
I’ve lost everything
By the time I realized this

1999
02:27:41,560 --> 02:27:44,480
By the time I realized this, Tayaramma…

2000
02:27:44,730 --> 02:27:46,440
Tayaramma…

2001
02:27:55,390 --> 02:27:57,260
Why are Amitabh Bachchan’s pictures
here too, Dad?

2002
02:27:57,810 --> 02:27:59,270
If it happens in his presence,

2003
02:27:59,350 --> 02:28:01,510
maybe I’ll get a grandson
like Amitabh Bachchan.

2004
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:02,640
I’m Bachchan myself.

2005
02:28:02,730 --> 02:28:04,060
If one is born,
it could be Abhishek Bachchan.

2006
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:07,720
- Even better. Goodbye. Bye.
- Now go. Shut the door.

2007
02:28:07,890 --> 02:28:08,930
Don't come back.

2008
02:28:09,810 --> 02:28:12,730
It's already too late. Come here…
