00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,716
<i>We interrupt scheduled programming
to bring you this breaking news.</i>

2
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,132
<i>Good afternoon.
In the last several minutes</i>

3
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,304
<i>KOB has received dozens of reports</i>

4
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,974
<i>of what appears to be a crashed
aircraft, possibly two aircraft</i>

5
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,976
<i>on Albuquerque's east side.</i>

6
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,769
<i>As of yet details are scarce,</i>

7
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,981
<i>but callers describe witnessing
an explosion overhead</i>

8
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,298
<i>followed by falling debris.
Visible now</i>

9
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,850
<i>crash investigators with the
National Transportation Safety Board</i>

10
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,781
<i>are expected on site
as early as this evening.</i>

11
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:42,998
<i>But officials warn</i>

12
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,285
<i>that with a debris field
of this magnitude, the investigation...</i>

13
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,788
<i>Officials are now saying
that the Boeing 737</i>

14
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,292
<i>was being re-routed,
or vectored, through the airspace</i>

15
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,809
<i>which is standard procedure
according to a spokesman for the FAA.</i>

16
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,257
{\an8}<i>The eight-seat King Air 350
was a charter flight</i>

17
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,678
{\an8}<i>operating out of St. George, Utah,
bound for Amarillo, Texas.</i>

18
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,931
<i>It sounded like hail,
like heavy hailstones.</i>

19
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:12,020
<i>It was just bump-bump-bump,
all over the neighborhood</i>

20
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:16,900
<i>indicating that the final death toll
now stands at 167.</i>

21
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,945
<i>...one hundred and sixty-seven.</i>

22
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,429
<i>This mid-air collision
has left many wondering</i>

23
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,575
<i>how such an accident could take place</i>

24
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,410
<i>in a system with so many safeguards.</i>

25
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,079
<i>...that the collision
which brought down Flight 515...</i>

26
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,625
<i>...was caused
by improper air traffic control.</i>

27
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,670
<i>We have the bombshell confirmation
out of Oklahoma City</i>

28
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,129
<i>as the FAA confirmed</i>

29
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:42,174
<i>it was indeed a lone air traffic
controller's fateful mistake</i>

30
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,992
<i>which brought about the crash.</i>

31
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,847
<i>...is Donald Margolis,
a 19-year veteran...</i>

32
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:52,143
<i>...of the FAA's Air Route Traffic
Control Center in Albuquerque...</i>

33
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,022
<i>...Margolis recently returned to work
after a five-week absence...</i>

34
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:58,483
<i>...which was due to, quote,
"a personal loss."</i>

35
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,570
<i>While it's now known that Margolis
had recently lost a daughter to a</i>

36
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,287
<i>drug overdose a month before.</i>

37
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,242
<i>His troubled daughter Jane Margolis,
aged 26</i>

38
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,412
<i>apparently had a long history
of substance abuse.</i>

39
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,978
<i>Friends of the family say</i>

40
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,130
<i>the death of his only child
hit Margolis particularly hard.</i>

41
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,087
<i>Coming as it did
little more than a month before</i>

42
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:22,154
<i>many are questioning
the timing of his return to work,</i>

43
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,657
<i>and are wondering
how much blame truly lies</i>

44
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,053
<i>with those
who let this grieving father...</i>

45
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,710
{\an8}I usually open with
"So sorry you're here."

46
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,004
{\an8}Where would you like to begin?

47
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,216
{\an8}I really just need this quick and easy,
you know?

48
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:33,221
{\an8}As quick as something like this
can be. So...

49
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:38,893
{\an8}Okay. Is that mutual?
Does your husband go along with that?

50
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,312
{\an8}Does he know?

51
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,233
{\an8}Well, I mean, he certainly knows
we're separated, so...

52
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,901
{\an8}Has he moved out?

53
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,195
{\an8}We're in the process of moving him out.

54
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,572
{\an8}Yeah. Today, hopefully.

55
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:54,742
{\an8}And in the meantime,
my son and my daughter,

56
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,709
and I are staying with my sister.

57
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:00,540
{\an8}- So you've moved out?
- Well, yes, just temporarily.

58
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,001
{\an8}Only so he could get his things and...

59
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:07,088
{\an8}That was supposed to happen last
week, but then came the crash and...

60
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,173
{\an8}Oh, God, you weren't one of the...?

61
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,260
{\an8}Right, yeah.
Right beneath the flight path.

62
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:18,766
And we had debris land in our yard,
and all over our neighborhood, so...

63
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,769
- Terrible.
- Yeah. Apparently, even

64
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,939
you know, parts of bodies.

65
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:29,777
So I certainly couldn't
bring myself to...

66
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,946
- So awful.
- I know.

67
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,450
Anyway, I was certainly not ready
to move back. But it's time.

68
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:40,538
And I'm sure we're driving
my sister and her husband up a wall.

69
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,292
{\an8}Well, you definitely wanna maintain
residency in your actual home.

70
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,212
{\an8}It just puts you in a better position
in regards to custody.

71
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,631
{\an8}Two children, you said?

72
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:56,596
{\an8}Yes. Holly here, and then I have a son
in high school, Walter Jr.

73
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,935
{\an8}- They need to stay with me.
- Okay.

74
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,146
{\an8}- How long have you been married?
- Sixteen years.

75
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,113
{\an8}And it's not an apartment,
it's a house that you live in?

76
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,486
Do you own outright,
do you have a mortgage...?

77
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:16,616
Yes, there's definitely a mortgage.
We have maybe 15 years on it.

78
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,661
What about other debts or assets?

79
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,977
Do you feel you have a good understanding

80
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,480
of you and your husband's
financial situation?

81
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,755
- Is your husband employed?
- Here's the thing.

82
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:35,176
I'm really not looking
for any sort of loopholes,

83
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:39,681
- or I don't know, just...
- No, no loopholes.

84
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:44,185
I just intend that every one of my clients
get a full and honest accounting

85
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:48,523
of what it is they owe
and what it is they own.

86
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,694
To that end,
I say let's leave no stone unturned.

87
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,950
You'd be amazed what I've seen
partners hide from one another.

88
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,190
Walt?

89
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,192
Hey, buddy?

90
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,998
Hey, Walt?

91
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,375
- Hey.
- There you are.

92
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,420
Listen, I... You know, well...

93
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,922
It's...

94
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,924
It's time.

95
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,349
The shittiest week since 9/11, okay?
Bar none.

96
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,466
This is it.
Hands down, we're living it.

97
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,853
I speak with authority

98
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,770
because we had some shitty weeks
the past few months.

99
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,107
But this here? I mean

100
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,527
call freaking Guinness Book
of World Records, call freaking...

101
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,011
Am I talking too much?
I am, right? I am, I know.

102
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:23,117
But this situation between you and...
You know, I don't know.

103
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,869
I'm not asking, by the way.
It's none of my business.

104
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,103
I do not wanna get
in the middle of you two.

105
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,083
I'm just saying, listen, okay?

106
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,627
You beat a little tactical retreat

107
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:36,214
you regroup, and then:

108
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,593
You know, absence makes the...
Yeah.

109
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,810
I'm pulling for you, man.
I'm pulling for you.

110
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,443
- No heavy lifting. I got it.
- No, it's okay.

111
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:59,487
I got it.

112
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:03,574
Jesus. What do you got in there,
cinder blocks?

113
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,247
Half a million in cash.

114
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,796
That's the spirit.

115
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,301
I got it, I got it.

116
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:45,617
<i>Who's here for self-improvement?</i>

117
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,037
Come on, give me a show of hands.

118
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:57,212
Who among you is here hoping they
can actively improve who they are?

119
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:06,221
All right. See, that's your first mistake.

120
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:09,891
You should be here
to learn self-acceptance.

121
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:19,734
Hey, honey, you want another waffle?

122
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:25,699
I still got the iron out.
I could cut up some bananas.

123
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:31,955
<i>Hi, you've reached Walt, Skyler, Flynn
and Holly. Please leave us a message.</i>

124
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,375
<i>Hey. Hello, everybody.
Good morning.</i>

125
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,918
<i>I was just checking in,</i>

126
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,714
<i>and thought I'd pass along
the current contact information.</i>

127
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,180
<i>You certainly
can always reach me on my cell</i>

128
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:47,512
<i>I've always got that on me,
but in terms of a mailing address</i>

129
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,764
<i>I'm here at the Beachcomber,</i>

130
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:53,435
<i>and you know what,
it's actually very nice, very pleasant.</i>

131
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:56,270
<i>Not as high-end as the Oakwood,
but not as corporate...</i>

132
00:14:56,354 --> 00:15:00,859
- Oh, hey, would you please just...?
- Hey, Dad, it's me.

133
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,194
No, I'm not okay.

134
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,030
I don't know what's going on.

135
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,198
Nobody's telling me jackshit around here.

136
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,409
- Hey, Flynn.
- Whatever.

137
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,369
I don't even care anymore.

138
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,955
Can you just give me a ride to school?

139
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:19,377
- I'll take you to school.
- Yeah. No, I'm ready now.

140
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,714
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.

141
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:28,053
All right, I'm here. See you soon.

142
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,083
Okay.

143
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,969
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

144
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:54,889
<i>As all of you know, last week
our city suffered a terrible tragedy.</i>

145
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,948
<i>One that none of us will ever forget.</i>

146
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,758
<i>Which is why today we're going to
take a little time out of our schedule</i>

147
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,565
<i>to gather in the gym and talk.</i>

148
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:11,239
I just find it, you know,
really, really hard to concentrate.

149
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:17,078
Because of all the horrors, you know,
we perceived.

150
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:21,124
It just really
gets inside your brain and...

151
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:26,379
In college, they have this thing
where if your roommate kills himself

152
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,258
like, if you come home and find him
hanging in the closet or whatever

153
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:34,387
it's basically an automatic A for you.

154
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,099
And I just think
that that kind of compassion is...

155
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,935
- Is something to...
- Okay. Thank you, Barry.

156
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,729
Who wants to go next?

157
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:48,359
No judgments, guys. Just feelings.

158
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:54,157
You can say anything and everything
that's on your mind. Anyone?

159
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,204
There you go, honey.

160
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,541
I just keep asking myself...

161
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,795
Honey, could you please stand up?

162
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:09,589
Thank you.

163
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,259
I just keep asking myself,
"Why did this happen?"

164
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,763
I mean, if there's a God and all

165
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,475
why does he allow all those
innocent people to die for no reason?

166
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,978
Okay, can we just keep it secular, honey?

167
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:27,774
Anyhow, I haven't
really been sleeping much.

168
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,235
Does anyone else have that?

169
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:36,282
I just keep hearing that sound.

170
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,328
That boom.

171
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:45,583
It just plays over and over in my head
like it won't ever stop.

172
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,840
Thank you, sweetheart.

173
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:55,969
- Is there anyone else?
- Over here.

174
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:04,769
My neighbor, he heard the crash,

175
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:09,023
and he ran outside,
and he found, like, this seat.

176
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,317
Like an airline seat.

177
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,194
Like what you have on a airliner?

178
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:18,032
Well, anyway, the seat was standing
perfectly upright in his front yard

179
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:22,871
right next to his Sea-Doos,
because, like, he has Sea-Doos.

180
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:27,500
But there was still a pair of legs
buckled into them.

181
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,961
Human legs.

182
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,631
Jesus H. Christ.

183
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,679
- You okay?
- Yeah, sorry. I'm...

184
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,016
I was just moved.

185
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,144
Maybe we should hear from the faculty.

186
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:51,524
Certainly this tragedy
didn't only affect our students.

187
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,652
Mr. White,
would you like to say something?

188
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,823
And by the way, welcome back.

189
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,668
It's so good to have you back.

190
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:31,356
I guess what I would... Sorry, sorry.

191
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,737
I guess what I would wanna say is

192
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:42,742
to look on the bright side.

193
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,623
First of all,
nobody on the ground was killed.

194
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,249
And that...

195
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:54,921
I mean, an incident like this,
over a populated urban center?

196
00:20:55,088 --> 00:21:00,885
That right there, that's just gotta be
some minor miracle. So...

197
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:04,305
Plus, neither plane was full.

198
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:10,979
You know, the 737 was, what, maybe
two-thirds full, I believe? Right, yes?

199
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,564
Or maybe even three-quarters full?

200
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:18,277
Well, at any rate,
what you're left with casualty-wise

201
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:22,490
is just the 50th-worst air disaster.

202
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,660
Actually, tied for 50th.

203
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,663
There are, in truth

204
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:34,168
53 crashes throughout history

205
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:38,631
that are just as bad or worse.
Tenerife.

206
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,802
Has anybody...?
Anybody hear of Tenerife? No?

207
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:48,141
In 1977, two fully loaded 747s

208
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,852
crashed into each other on Tenerife.

209
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:55,023
Does anybody know how big a 747 is?

210
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:59,444
I mean, it's way bigger than a 737,
and we're talking about two of them.

211
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,948
Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.

212
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:09,704
But do any of you even remember it
at all? Any of you? I doubt it.

213
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:16,044
You know why?
It's because people move on.

214
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,379
They just move on.

215
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:22,133
And we will too. We will move on,
and we will get past this.

216
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:29,057
Because that is what
human beings do, we survive, and...

217
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:34,812
We survive and we overcome. Yeah.

218
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:39,192
We survive. We survive and...

219
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,820
- Okay?
- Thank you.

220
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:45,239
Good.

221
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,651
Hey, how's your Aunt Marie doing?

222
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,988
Fine. I guess.

223
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,748
You make sure you say hello to her
for me, will you?

224
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:38,913
Why don't you just come inside?
It's your house.

225
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,874
No, I...

226
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,452
He's gone.

227
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:24,583
Hey, Flynn. How's tricks?

228
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,795
- How's what?
- Tricks. It's an expression.

229
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,714
How are you?

230
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,092
Why you gotta treat him like this?

231
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,760
Why you gotta be like this?

232
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:39,473
- Why can't you just talk even?
- Hey, hey, hey. Cool down, okay?

233
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:54,196
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?

234
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,120
You know, try not to hold it against him.

235
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:06,959
You know, I mean, the poor kid,
he's probably just dying of curiosity.

236
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:12,465
You know, and I guess
it would be natural for him to wonder.

237
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,259
He's probably wondering, "What is it
that could have gone so wrong...

238
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:19,138
- Marie. Marie.
- ...that my mother would leave...?"

239
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,105
I can't help you get through this

240
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:24,351
you know, if you won't tell me
what it is that Walt did.

241
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:28,022
Well, you know what, I don't remember
asking you, all right?

242
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,692
So if you wanna be supportive,
you could be supportive without prying.

243
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,902
- That would be really great...
- "Prying."

244
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:38,032
- ...and so helpful.
- Well, prying's a strong word.

245
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:48,793
It's that voice inside your head.

246
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:54,840
It's that sneaky, rat-bastard,
24/7 voice.

247
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,650
You know what I'm talking about.

248
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,554
That voice that tells you
you're not good enough.

249
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:04,725
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to be what

250
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,144
president of the United States?

251
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,648
Well, okay,
so maybe you're not that good.

252
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:12,525
But now

253
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:17,530
are you good enough to deserve
your share of basic human happiness?

254
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:22,701
Are you good enough to be okay
with who and what you are?

255
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,079
I say yes.

256
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,418
But it doesn't matter what I say.

257
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,769
It's your voice, which means
you're the one that hears it.

258
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:38,926
Which means you're the only one
that can fight it, right?

259
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:42,930
Jesse, we never hear from you.

260
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:48,936
What's going on? You can tell me
I'm full of shit. It's okay, I don't mind.

261
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:52,606
Just come on. Let us in on it.

262
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:03,742
So, like, what makes you the expert?

263
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,635
I don't think I ever said I was that.

264
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,456
Yeah, but you're the one
sitting here, right?

265
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:16,463
Telling us "thus" and "so," "be happy,"
"forgive yourself," blah, blah, blah.

266
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:20,050
Have you ever really hurt anybody?

267
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:25,431
I don't just mean disappointed
your mother or whatever,

268
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:31,478
but did you ever really hurt someone?

269
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,984
I killed my daughter.

270
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:47,453
It was July 18th, which is my birthday.

271
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,999
July 18th, 1992.

272
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:55,836
I was high on cocaine and I was drunk.

273
00:29:56,003 --> 00:30:00,299
Cocaine wasn't an issue. I had bought
myself two grams as a birthday present.

274
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:01,967
I had plenty left.

275
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,762
But I was out of vodka.

276
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,847
And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia

277
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,309
where instead of selling liquor
in the supermarkets

278
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,269
they have these ABC stores

279
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:18,400
which close at 5 p.m.,
and right then it was like 4:42.

280
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:22,488
So I'm arguing with my wife.

281
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:26,492
"Come on. Go to the ABC for me,
it's my birthday.

282
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:31,205
Come on.
They're not gonna sell it to me."

283
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,625
And she's saying "No, no."

284
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:40,673
So I'm pissed. And the clock is ticking,
so I jump in my truck.

285
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:45,344
She's my 6-year-old daughter.

286
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,682
She's playing at the end of the driveway.

287
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,394
So...

288
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:02,152
How do you not hate yourself?

289
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:06,407
I did hate myself for a long time.

290
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:11,537
But it didn't stop me
from drinking and getting high.

291
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:14,415
It just made it that much worse.

292
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,088
Self-hatred, guilt,
it accomplishes nothing.

293
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:23,924
It just stands in the way.

294
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,219
Stands in the way of what?

295
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,763
True change.

296
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,004
Skyler.

297
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,381
Is this a good time to talk?

298
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,135
Yeah. Come in. Please.

299
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:15,768
Skyler.

300
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,248
Do you wanna start?

301
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,510
Okay.

302
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:13,784
Why are you doing this?
Why are you even thinking this way?

303
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:18,038
- Is it to punish me?
- I am not punishing you, Walt.

304
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:23,502
This is punitive, is what this is.
We are happily married.

305
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:29,675
I am happily married. I am happy.
We're just...

306
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:41,728
I love you, Skyler.
And I would do anything for you.

307
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:49,236
Would you even consider...?
I mean, Jesus!

308
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:52,906
You come in here and you wave
these papers in my face

309
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:58,078
when there's a whole other,
entire side to this thing.

310
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:02,249
There's your side and there's my side,
and you haven't heard my side yet.

311
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,209
You haven't heard any of it at all.

312
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,545
You're a drug dealer.

313
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:14,761
No. What...? How...? What?

314
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,064
Yeah.

315
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:31,445
How else could you possibly
make that kind of money?

316
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:40,412
Marijuana. That Pinkman kid.

317
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,630
No?

318
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,801
Oh, my God, Walt.

319
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,722
Cocaine?

320
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,561
It's methamphetamine.

321
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:11,902
But I'm a manufacturer,
I'm not a dealer...

322
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,323
per se.

323
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:20,118
It doesn't mean... No, Skyler!

324
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,886
- Listen to me. Skyler, listen...
- No, no!

325
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:26,458
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?
It's complicated, all right?

326
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:31,630
So please, let's... Please, let's just
sit back down and talk it through.

327
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,591
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.

328
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:39,513
I won't tell Hank and I won't tell
your children or anybody else.

329
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,598
Nobody will hear it from me.

330
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:45,519
But only if you grant me this divorce
and stay out of our lives.

331
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,272
- No, Skyler...
- I mean it.

332
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,984
Now let me the hell out of here
before I throw up.

333
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,003
Bye, Jesse.

334
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,856
Your windshield's broken.

335
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:35,027
Yeah.

336
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:44,745
Little friction
in the marriage right now.

337
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:47,915
Strictly temporary. We're just...

338
00:36:48,082 --> 00:36:50,334
We're just taking a little break.

339
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:55,089
That's you, over there.

340
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:59,927
Listen, money.

341
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:03,556
Saul has got it for you,
so as soon as you're feeling better...

342
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,599
I'm better.

343
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:09,937
You're better? Really?

344
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:16,443
- What, the rehab? It helped?
- Yeah. I'm done using.

345
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:20,739
That's excellent. That's...

346
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:26,745
That's very good, Jesse.
Boy, very good.

347
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:33,711
You know, in spite of how bad things got

348
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:38,465
it really could be looked at
like a wake-up call for both of us.

349
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:43,637
I mean, you know, just to get our lives
back together again,

350
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:47,975
and on the straight and narrow.

351
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:53,731
You been following this airplane crash?

352
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:56,984
Yeah.

353
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:01,947
You know it was Jane's dad who
accidentally crashed them together

354
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,158
because he was so torn up?

355
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:07,578
Okay, look, let me stop you
right there, all right?

356
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:10,289
You are not responsible for this.

357
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:13,626
Not in any way, shape or form, all right?

358
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:18,172
Now, I am very up-to-date on this thing,
probably far more than you are,

359
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,301
and there are many factors at play there.

360
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:23,928
Yeah?

361
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:29,308
For instance, there's some sort of
collision radar on the jet

362
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:31,185
that may not have been working.

363
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:33,520
That's public record.
You can look that up.

364
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:37,358
And the whole system
is run on 1960s technology.

365
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:38,817
No.

366
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:44,031
No, really, I blame the government.

367
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:50,704
You either run from things
or you face them, Mr. White.

368
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:54,792
- What exactly does that mean?
- I learned it in rehab.

369
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:59,546
It's all about accepting
who you really are.

370
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:02,675
I accept who I am.

371
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,134
And who are you?

372
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:07,972
I'm the bad guy.

373
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:27,950
Here's some napkins for you.

374
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:30,077
Enjoy.

375
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:37,501
- Is the food to your satisfaction?
- Very much.

376
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:40,212
It's good to see you again.

377
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:45,467
- May I?
- Please.

378
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:54,601
I have an offer that I think
will be of interest to you.

379
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:01,483
I actually am not here to...

380
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:09,783
I'm here because I owe you
the courtesy and respect

381
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:12,536
to tell you this personally.

382
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,415
I'm done.

383
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:21,503
It has nothing to do with you personally.

384
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:24,798
I find you extraordinarily professional,

385
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:27,301
and I appreciate the way you do business.

386
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:32,973
I'm just making a change in my life,
is what it is.

387
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,771
And I'm...
I'm at something of a crossroads,

388
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:44,651
and it's brought me to a realization.

389
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:49,531
I am not a criminal.

390
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:54,453
No offense to any people who are...

391
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,335
but this is not me.

392
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:06,632
I'd like you to hear my offer,
notwithstanding.

393
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:10,844
It won't change my mind, I'm sorry.

394
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:15,307
Three million dollars
for three months of your time.

395
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:21,438
Three months, then out.

396
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:29,321
Three million?

397
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:34,701
May I take this as a "yes"?

398
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:48,132
I have money. I have more money
than I know how to spend.

399
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:52,886
What I don't have is my family.

400
00:41:54,388 --> 00:41:57,182
The answer is still no.

401
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:05,232
Enjoy your meal.

402
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:12,823
Thank you.

403
00:44:17,531 --> 00:44:20,117
What the hell's going on in there?
