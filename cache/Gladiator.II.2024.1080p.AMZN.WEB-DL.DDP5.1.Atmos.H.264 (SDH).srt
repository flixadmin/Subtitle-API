Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,077
Emperor Geta.

Emperor Caracalla.

183
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,167
General Acacius.

184
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,254
I have taken Numidia
in your names

185
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,172
that your dominion
may eclipse that

186
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,466
of every emperor
that came before you.

187
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,094
Crown him with laurels,
brother.

[monkey hooting softly]

191
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,697
[Geta] In honor
of your conquest,

192
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,783
there will be games
in the Colosseum.

193
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,495
I require no games
in my honor.

194
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,166
Serving the Senate
and the people of Rome

195
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,959
is honor enough for me.

196
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,837
You are too modest,
Acacius.

197
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,132
It does not suit a general
as accomplished as yourself.

198
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,095
The glory is yours,
not mine.

199
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,307
I only ask for
some respite from war

200
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,892
to spend time
with my wife.

201
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,394
Your wife, yes. [sniffs]

202
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,188
Remember the privileges
we have granted her?

[sword scraping]

204
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,816
Where is she now
to ignore such an occasion?

205
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,694
There are victories
yet still to come.

206
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,864
Persia.

207
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,116
India.

[chuckles]

209
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,996
Both... must be conquered.

210
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,417
Rome has so many subjects.

211
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,461
She must feed them.

212
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,964
They can eat war.
[laughs]

213
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,970
Your triumphs
will be celebrated

214
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,224
as a tribute
to the greatness

215

For the bravest of you,

the road to glory
runs through the arena.

The arena turns slaves
into gladiators

and gladiators into free men.

What is your native language?

You don't answer because
you can't or because you won't?

Mm, all right.

291
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,546
Violence...

Viggo,
put him through his paces.

You will do well.

315
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,792
It is an art,

316
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,794
choosing gladiators.

317
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,422
Some choose entertainers.

318
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,591
Some choose brute force.

319
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,218
I choose rage.

And they love those who
love blood as much as they do.

323
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,603
And you, my friend, rage

324
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,565
pours out of you like...

325

327
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,198
You will be
quite the fighter.

328
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,825
Not for you.

329
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,994
You're right,
you do not fight for me.

330
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,454
I put you in the ring,
you fight or you die.

The choice is yours.

332

But whose head
could I give you

333
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:13,462
that would satisfy this fury?

334
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,464

Too much.

Mm.

338
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,973

-Mm.

Use your rage
in my service,

and you will have his head
ready for your sword.

Serve me and I will serve you.
Deny me...

00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,369
and you will die.

345
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,371
[thunder rumbles
in distance]

346
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,124
There are times I wished
you'd abandoned me

347
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,001
rather than
fight their wars.

348
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,128
I've made my choice.

349
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,049
I can live with it.

350
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:05,097
But my patience with those two
is at an end.

351
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,019
Leta?

352
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:13,689
You may go to your quarters now.
We need nothing more.

353
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,406
To hear wives and mothers
mourning their dead

354
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,283
on that beach at Numidia...

355
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,454
Lucilla.

356
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,044
No more.

357
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,465
I will not waste

358
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:43,177
another generation
of young men for their vanity.

359
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,933
If I fight another campaign,
it must be to depose them.

360
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,937
When will your troops
arrive?

361
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,023
They land at Ostia
in ten days.

362
00:37:56,107 --> 00:38:00,152
How many of them will be
loyal to you alone?

363
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,197
All of them.

364
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,828
The emperors do not have
the support of the people.

365
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:13,708
The people are weary
of the madness, the tyranny.

366

[sighs]

367
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:20,840
What is the dream of Rome
if her people are not free?

00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,551

everyone,

00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,742
to excess!

374
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,786
Thank you. Thank you.

[castrato singing

Oh!

00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,845
[laughs] Please, drink.

378
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,848
Ah! Excuse me. Macrinus!

379
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,769
I knew the provinces
were not enough for you.

380
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:18,022
-I'm just here for the games.
-Ah, well,

381
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,732
you won't be disappointed.

382
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:23,027
Rome has all the games
that men like you like to play.

383
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,363
Men like me, Thraex?
Men like us.

384
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,991
I know nothing happens in Rome
unless you've tasted it first.

385
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,785
[both laughing]

386
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,093
What is my purpose here?

387
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,677
You'll find out soon enough.

388
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,393
What's this we hear
about you being interested

389
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:59,230
in standing for election
to the Senate, Macrinus?

390
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,816
Me? No, I'm, uh...

391
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,402
I don't even know how
to use an abacus.

392
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,278
But I do understand that

393
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,781
it's customary
for your guests

394
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:11,492
to make wagers
at these affairs?

395
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,869
How large a sum
did you have in mind?

396
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,914
A thousand gold denarii?

397
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,374
Two.

398
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,544
Two?

Lords, ladies and gentlemen,
and senators.

For your entertainment,

406

-This is your gladiator?
-It is.

[Thraex] Three rounds,
hand to hand.

Swords!

415
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,277
We want swords.
A fight to the death.

416
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,531
No quarter to be offered...
or given.

417

-Fight now!

Remarkable.

From where do you hail?

Speak.

440
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,183
I said speak.

441
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,977
He is from the colonies,
Your Majesty.

[laughing] But...

446
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,796
to come back from hell

and view the cheerful skies,

I've grown so bored,
but you surprise me.

To amuse you is my only wish.

We are amused,

perform in the arena.

Who taught you poetry?

A captured Roman officer.

470
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,344
I was posted guard over him
and he used to tell us tales

471
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,346
to pass the time.

472
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,473

Oh, we ate him.

As barbarians do.

As barbarians do.

And where were you born?

477
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,359
Why does my past matter
if it is my future

Tell me what use have I
for Roman money.

480

A gladiator

can buy his own freedom.

No, the slave dreams
not of freedom

but of a slave
to call his own.

487

Is that what you were
raised on, Macrinus?

What did you have to do
for Roman money?

489

You promised me a head.

490

To take back the city.

will enter Rome
and then the Colosseum,

where they will
arrest the emperors

00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,913
and their people.

511
00:47:55,789 --> 00:48:00,794
Uh, this plan
is ambitious and risky.

512
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,630
Rome will be yours
to administer and to--

513
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:08,385
Marcus Aurelius talked of
restoring power to the Senate,

514
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:12,806
but that was a generation ago.
Much has changed.

515
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,810
The people
have not seen hope

516
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,270
for many years.

517
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:22,024
But with time...
and guidance...

518
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,567
[sighs sharply]

519
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:27,070
Lucilla, you are the daughter
of Marcus Aurelius.

520
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,281
He had my loyalty.

521
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,993
And so do you.

522
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,747
Senator Thraex?

523
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:41,877
Politics follows power,
my lady.

524
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,048
Take back
what is rightfully yours...

525
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,092
and the Senate
will support you.

526
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,386
Thank you.

527
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,904
Food! Food!

528
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,869
When I was told of this place,

529
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,205
they never mentioned
the stink.

530
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,291
That would be Hanno.

531
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,544
[laughter]

532
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,464
Well, you'll have to
put up with me as I am.

533
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,049
[laughing]

534
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,806
And what's that up there?
A wolf?

535
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:40,727
The twins there,
they were outcasts.

536
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,562
Left in the hills to die.

537
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,693
That wolf found them and she
suckled them on her milk.

538
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,238
Raised by an animal.
It's in their blood.

539
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,241
How do you know this place?

540
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,411
I know the chaos
they brought.

541
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,373
This city infects
everything it touches.

542
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,542
I never dreamt
it would be so big.

543
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,377
Don't fall for it.

544
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,546
This city is diseased.

545
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,008
[peasants] Food! Food!

00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,163
-Ah!
-Thraex.

556
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:27,959
About our wager.

557
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,795
Ah. The barbarian.

558
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,213
Yes, I haven't forgotten,
I always repay my debts.

559
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,173
I was merely
going to suggest

560
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,217
that perhaps your luck
might change.

561
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,761
Shall we say
double or quits?

562
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,391
-Ah.
-Ah.

563
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,519

Fresh meat.

00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,885
Line up! Line up!

[playing simple fanfare]

572
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:09,603
Emperor Caracalla.

00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,147
Emperor Geta.

574
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,858

[crowd cheering]

576
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,863
These sacred games

577
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:23,200
are held to honor
the victory of Rome

578
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,369
over the barbarians of Numidia.

[announcer] And to honor
Rome's legionary commander,

582
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,882
General Justus Acacius!

584
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,178
[announcer] And with him

585
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:47,974
Lucilla, the daughter
of Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

-[woman, faintly] Lucilla!
-[man] Mother of Rome!

00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,649
Acacius.

589
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,359
General.

Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

593
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,418
Speak to them.

594
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,004
[man faintly]
Speak to us!

595
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:26,096
[cheering ebbs]

596
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,974
I am not an orator

597
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,684
or a politician.

598
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,603
I am a soldier.

599
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:41,278
I have seen bravery
in men and women during war.

600
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,822
And even once in this arena.

601
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,075
So if you ask anything
of the gods...

602
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,371
ask for that same bravery.

603
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,792
Because Rome needs it now.

[rhino groaning]

681
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:04,721
The road to freedom doesn't
run through the arena.

682
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,056
It leads to this.

683
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,479
Go to your cells.

684
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,191
[all cheering, clapping]

685
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:20,903
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

686
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,158
[panting]

01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,877
[dog whimpers]

688
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,172
Come on, let's go.

689
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:55,646
"Gates of hell
are open night and day.

690
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,232
[voice wavering]
Smooth is the descent...

691
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,318
[crying]
...easy is the way."

692
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,741
[boy]
There, there, there, there.

693
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:08,159
And I've got you.

694
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:10,953
I'm Maximus,
the savior of Rome!

695
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:32,558
Scatto and Argento.

696
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:37,480
[people cheer, echoing]

697
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,652
[gasping softly]

698
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,657
Lucius is safe?

699
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,551
[Lucilla] Lucius!

700
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,437
[horse whinnies]

701
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:21,065
[Lucilla] Lucius,

702
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:24,193
you're the sole heir
to the throne now.

703
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,196
There are men
who want to kill you

704
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,823
so they can take power.

705
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:33,661
I promise I'll bring you back
as soon as it's safe.

706
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:37,373
Mother, why can't you
come with me?

707
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,917
[crying] I... I have to
stay here for your sake.

708
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,003
[sniffles]
And for the sake of Rome.

709
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:44,589
Remember who you are.

710
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:46,632
And that I love you.

711
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:48,718
I love you.

712
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,678
[man] Come.

713
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,308
Give me your leg.

714
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,811
Go. Go!

715
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,354
[horse whinnies]

716
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,069
[doctor] So...

717
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,655
[Hanno grunts]

718
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:11,824
What's your name?

719
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,452
[exhales]

720
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:17,204
I'm Ravi. I'm a doctor.

721
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,876
Because... more men die
of infected wounds

722
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:24,587
than out there, in the arena.

723
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,758
This needs to be cleaned,
it needs to be stitched and

724
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:31,552
[exclaims softly]
it is going to hurt.

725
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:32,803
Mm.

726
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:36,015
This is Devil's Breath
and opium.

727
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:38,184
It's for the pain.

728
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,853
You should breathe in.

729
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:42,980
[inhales sharply,
grunts]

730
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:45,149
[deep inhale]

731
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:48,277
[Ravi] I've been here
so long now,

732
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,821
I don't even notice anymore.

733
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:53,741
I've done more amputations
than I can count.

734
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:57,453
-Where'd you learn your trade?
-Why do you ask?

735
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:59,288
You've got a heavy hand.

736
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:02,083
I used to be
a gladiator myself.

737
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:03,542
Ah.

738
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,753
-And would you have bested me?
-[Ravi chuckles]

739
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:07,421
In your prime, of course.

740
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:11,217
In your current state,
I could best you now.

741
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,885
[laughs]

742
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:16,222
Luckily for you,
I have put down my sword.

743
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,516
-So now I spend my days
-[groaning]

744
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:21,185
saving lives
instead of taking them.

745
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:22,603
[inhales, grunts]

746
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:25,272
And why such a change
so late in life?

747
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:28,275
What we do in life

748
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,820
echoes in eternity.

749
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:32,822
[panting softly]

750
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:36,117
I feel like
I know those words.

751
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,744
[Ravi chuckles]
I can't take credit.

752
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,414
It's written on
one of the tombs.

753
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,166
Over the bones of a gladiator.

754
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,584
-[sharp grunt of pain]
-[Macrinus] My champion!

755
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,878
I smell Devil's Breath!

756
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,214
[laughing]

757
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:53,759
My... champion.

758
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:56,470
Did you hear that crowd?

759
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,684
-Did you hear that crowd?
-Mm-hm.

760
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:05,730
You have something.
I knew it from the start.

761
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:09,775
-Did you now?
-Yes. The Greeks call it...

762
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:12,028
thymos.

763
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:13,529
Smoke.

764
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:15,614
Rage.

765
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,659
That rage is your gift.

766
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:22,079
Like the great Achilles.

767
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,498
Never let it go.

768
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:27,460
It will carry you
to greatness,

769
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,420
my champion.

770
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:40,681
[horses whinny, snort]

771
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,858
Thank you

772
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,902
for inviting me.

773
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:55,071
This is truly an honor.

774
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,994
I hear you are
the talk of the court.

775
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,454
[kissing hand]

776
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:05,414
Yes.

777
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:07,750
We've met before.

778
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,503
-Have we?
-Long ago.

779
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,464
Where?

780
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:15,466
I was in the service
of your father's army

781
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:17,676
on his African campaign.

782
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:20,930
You served
with my father?

783
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:23,182
[groaning]

784
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:25,768
Mm.

785
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,479
I had the privilege

786
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:31,023
of reading
his "Meditations."

787
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,441
Mm.

788
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:37,363
"The best revenge

789
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:41,742
is to be unlike him
who performed the injury."

790
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:46,497
I hear you've been
arming half the legions

791
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:51,710
in the entire empire,
and here, now, in Rome...

792
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,881
you're gaining influence
by sponsoring gladiators.

793
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,050
I do it for the love
of the sport.

794
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,220
And where did you find
these gladiators?

795
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:04,974
They're usually
prisoners of war.

796
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:09,311
Or vagrants.
Why do you ask?

797
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,231
A man can choose to fight...

798
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:15,693
and stay alive.

799
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:18,988
It's the same in life as it is
in the arena, is it not?

800
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:23,033
Who is this?

801
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,578
That is my father
as a youth.

802
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:29,957
[Macrinus]
She had a child?

803
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,792
Mm. [swallows]

804
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:34,295
It's common knowledge.
When Commodus was killed,

805
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:36,172
-the boy disappeared.
-Mm.

806
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,340
-But who would care?
-Lucilla would care.

-More wine!
-More wine!

808
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:46,015
He was of the royal bloodline,
after all.

809
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:48,976
And his father?

810
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:53,814
[senator] Ostensibly,
Lucius Verus.

811
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,691
See, it was
an arranged marriage.

812
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:56,859
She was 14.

813
01:09:56,942 --> 01:10:00,321
-Mm.
-Females were not his taste.

814
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:01,780
-Nor mine, some days.
-Nor yours!

815

[both laugh]

816
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:07,661
No, no, no.
By rumor, you see, she took lovers.

817
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:11,999
And by rumor, the real father...
was Commodus.

818
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,336
-Brotherly love, you see?
-Yeah.

819
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:17,171
If he died,

820
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:20,549
-there has to be remains.
-Mm.

821
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:23,969
And if he lived,
that would make him about...

822
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,138
Um, well,
let's work it out.

823
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:29,642
-He was about 12 when he died?
-Yes.

824
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:34,104
So that would make him...

Gladiator...

832
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:37,793
do you know me?

833
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,553
Do you have a family?

834
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:53,309
A wife. Arishat.

835
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:56,186
Arishat.

836
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:59,606
She was killed
under your husband's command.

837

[sighing] Rome drowns
in its own blood.

And yet you enjoy
the pleasures of the Colosseum.

There is much
you do not understand.

01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,299
My name is Hanno,

844
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:27,926
and I have no mother,
or none that I can remember.

845
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,598
[sniffles]

846
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:36,560
[crying] I'm so sorry.

847
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:38,771
If your son were here,
I feel sure he would tell you

848
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:40,773
not to grieve him.

849
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:42,608
For he would not be the boy
that you sent away.

850
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,777
That boy is dead.

851
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,281
You may think
I have little worth.

852
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:52,951
You may think
I betrayed you.

853
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:56,705
But I need you to know...

854
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,001
if you will not have
your mother's love,

855
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:04,046
then take
your father's strength.

856
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:06,632
You need it.

857
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:13,138
His name was
Maximus Decimus Meridius.

858
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:15,933
And I see him in you.

859
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:17,476
Get out.

860
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:22,064
[Gracchus]
My lady, we must go at once!

861
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:24,274
[Lucilla sobs]

862
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:27,861
Lucius, you were loved

863
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:31,115
by myself
and by your father.

864
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:32,199
[sniffles]

865
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:33,784
Your name
was on his lips--

866
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:35,744
Get out!

867
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:41,875
[panting]

868
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:43,919
[door shuts]

869
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:54,638
[Lucilla exhales]

870
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,689
Lucius is alive.

871
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:07,776
Are you certain?

872
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,236
Yes.

873
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:11,530
I know my son.

874
01:14:14,491 --> 01:14:16,452
I spoke to him
tonight.

875
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:22,916
He may be lost to me
for what I did,

876
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:25,836
but he lives.

877
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:29,590
The third day of the games
is tomorrow.

878
01:14:29,673 --> 01:14:31,258
Most fighters won't survive.

879
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:32,801
Acacius,

880
01:14:34,094 --> 01:14:35,679
you must help him.

881
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,390
-Help him?
-[crying] Yes.

882
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:43,395
I failed him then.

883
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,481
I know I did.

884
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:49,401
I cannot fail him now.

885
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,405
The army is in Ostia.

886
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:56,283
If we wait a few days...

887
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:58,494
He could be dead
by then.

888
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:01,788
Acacius,

889
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:05,584
I would willingly
give my life for Rome,

890
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:09,171
but I will not
give my son's.

891
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:17,638
[Viggo] And one.

892
01:15:18,388 --> 01:15:20,182
And two.

893
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:22,976
-And one.
-[all groaning with effort]

894
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:26,021
Together.
Timing, timing, timing!

895
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:30,359
And one. And two.

896
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,903
And one.

897
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:34,988
Pause, pause!

898
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,034
We won't get far
like this.

899
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:40,619
[all laughing]

900
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:43,121
Just him. You go.

901
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,915
Go!

902
01:15:44,998 --> 01:15:48,585
Let's see how far you can go
on your own without your team.

903
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,713
Ready?

904
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,131
One!

905
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:54,883
And two!

906
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,135
Timing, timing!

907
01:15:57,761 --> 01:15:59,221
Come on, more!

908
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:01,557
[grunts]

909
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:06,061
[Viggo] More!

910
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:15,862
[Lucius groans loudly]

911
01:16:18,865 --> 01:16:20,742
[heavy grunt]

912
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:24,079
Leave him.

913
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:26,290
[indistinct chatter]

914
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,209
[huffs, grunts]

915

[cork pops]

916
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:46,476
[stammering] It's just
vinegar, my friend.

917
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:48,312
[pained groan]

918
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:50,981
There will be
no more opium for you.

919
01:16:52,232 --> 01:16:55,902
There is plenty of pain waiting
for you in the next life.

920
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:59,448
I don't know why you are so
greedy for it in this one.

921
01:17:04,077 --> 01:17:05,537
Are you a free man, Ravi?

922
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,539
[dry chuckle] "Free."

923
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,585
I am. Mm.

924
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:13,211
I laid down my sword

925
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,297
and I swore never
to pick it up again.

926
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,965
And yet
you choose this hell?

927
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:18,675
Mm-hm.

928
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:20,177
What was your home before?

929
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:22,763
Varanasi.

930
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:25,140
And why don't you go back?

931
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:26,683
I wish I could.

932

-[breath hissing]
-But...

933
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:33,148
-I met a woman. [laughs]
-Ah.

934
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,360
-It's always a woman.
-Always.

935
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:40,405
She is from Londinium.
Britannia. You know.

936
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,324
So now...

937
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:45,369
our sons,
they speak only Latin.

938
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:47,871
My daughter's eyes,
they are as blue as yours.

939

[chuckles lightly]

940
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:52,167
We are Romans now.

941
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:56,004
I grew up hearing stories
at my grandfather's knee.

942
01:17:57,089 --> 01:18:00,509
He used to talk
of the dream that was Rome.

943
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:06,765
It was so fragile,
you could only whisper it...

944
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:10,852
or it would vanish.

945
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:13,146
[whispering] So,

946
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,898
what was this dream?

947
01:18:14,981 --> 01:18:19,611
A Rome where all could live
under fair law and be protected.

948
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:22,447
A Rome of the Senate.

949
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:25,617
A Rome of hope.

950
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:32,999
Your grandfather,
he sounds like a dangerous man.

951
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,376
Hm.

952
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:39,256

[light chuckle]

954
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:43,635
The odds
are always against me.

955
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:45,721
Don't worry, old man.

956
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:47,639
-Eh?

958
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:53,353
-You should get some rest. Hm?
-Mm.

959
01:18:54,354 --> 01:18:56,898
Your men will need you
to lead them tomorrow.

This is about survival.

Survive!

In the name of Poseidon,

They have archers.

967

Be ready.
Listen for my commands.

968
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,684
Stay together
and pull as one, yes?

1012
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:39,579
[soldier] Everyone regroup!

1013
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:45,460

[crowd exclaiming]

1017
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:17,867
Praetorians!

1018
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:21,621
[crowd chanting]
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1019
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:22,664
Move, move.

1020
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:25,291
[chanting continues]

1021
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:32,757
[announcer]
In the name of the emperors...

1022
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:37,512
the victor is Hanno!

1023
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:42,434
[all chanting in support]

1024
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:51,109
Who did this?

1025
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:56,072
Who did this?!

1026
01:23:56,656 --> 01:23:58,867
-It was me!
-I did it!

1027
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:00,910
-I did it! I did it! I did it!
-It was me!

1028
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:07,584
Geta will want retribution
for all of you.

1029
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:09,794
Did you learn to shoot
in the same place

1030
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:11,379
you learned to recite poetry?

1031
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:12,630
Be glad it wasn't me,

1032
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:14,090
or that arrow
would have found you.

1033
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:16,342
[men laughing]

1034
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:20,013
[indistinct chatter]

1035
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:22,557
[faint music playing]

1036
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,441
Be seated.

1037
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:35,361
I have news for you.

1038
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:41,326
He's here, sir.

1039
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,287
[door opens]

1040
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:46,456
[Macrinus]
Oh, still here.

1041
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,458
[Thraex laughs nervously]

1042
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:49,959
Macrinus.

1043
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:52,253
-[Macrinus chuckles]
-Welcome.

1044
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:56,049
Yes, I'm listening.

1045
01:24:56,132 --> 01:24:58,718
You know
this is my house now.

1046
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:01,137
Your debt to me is
over 10,000 denarii.

1047
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:02,597
You know that.

1048
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:05,308
[chuckles, stammers]
I have other things. Uh...

1049
01:25:05,391 --> 01:25:07,185
Cattle. Art!

1050
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:08,895
Truth, then.

1051
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:10,563
What do you... want?

1052
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:13,316
Truth.
That's what I want.

1053
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:17,946
Nothing happens in Rome
without your knowledge.

1054
01:25:18,988 --> 01:25:21,116
You have
the senators' trust.

1055
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:24,077
You have
Lucilla's trust.

1056
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,955
More importantly,
you have my trust.

1057
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:32,877
You wish my... loyalty?

1058
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:34,712
I own...

1059
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:37,924
your house.

1060
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:40,718
I want your loyalty.

1061
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:45,890
I...

1062
01:25:47,016 --> 01:25:48,810
-Tell me.
-I have heard...

1063
01:25:48,893 --> 01:25:51,646
of a plot...

1064
01:25:52,438 --> 01:25:55,150
-to dethrone the emperors.
-Yes.

1065
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:57,694
But the plan
has been delayed, uh...

1066
01:25:57,777 --> 01:26:00,947
A gladiator is to be rescued
from the arena.

1067
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:02,448
-Tonight.
-Mm.

1068
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:05,743
-I don't know why.
-I know why. I know who.

1069
01:26:08,037 --> 01:26:09,205
Pack.

1070
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:14,377
Quickly.

1071
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:43,364
-[pounding on gate]
-[man] Open up!

1072
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:45,617
[rats squeaking]

1073
01:26:58,546 --> 01:27:00,256
[mastiffs growling]

1074
01:27:03,426 --> 01:27:05,470
[man] Open for
the emperors' guard!

1075
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:07,222
[pounding on door]

1076
01:27:29,786 --> 01:27:31,412
[heavy knocking]

1077
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:36,501
My Lady, come with us.

1078
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,972
[all grunting with impact]

1079
01:28:21,754 --> 01:28:24,007
Thanks to the civic virtue

1080
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:26,801
of men like Thraex
and Macrinus,

1081
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:29,804
your insurrection

1082
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:32,473
has been revealed.

1083
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:35,685
The honor,

1084
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:40,648
the dignitas that Rome
has bestowed upon you...

1085
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:46,112
all this you have forfeited
by your treachery.

1086
01:28:46,195 --> 01:28:48,239
Please, Emperor Geta.

1087
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:50,783
Torture me if you want,

1088
01:28:51,617 --> 01:28:52,994
but do not lecture me.

1089
01:28:53,077 --> 01:28:56,622
Your name
will be forgotten!

1090
01:28:57,623 --> 01:29:00,752
Lost... to history.

1091
01:29:02,628 --> 01:29:04,047
You are damned,
General.

1092
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:05,965
[laughing]

1093
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,801
-[Geta] You laugh.
-You damn me?

1094
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:11,554
I don't care.

1095
01:29:11,637 --> 01:29:15,183
Everything is forgotten in time.
Empires fall. So do emperors.

1096
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:16,976
[Caracalla] Why wait?

1097
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:20,271
-I will gut him right now!
-No, no, no!

1098
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:23,649
Let them be. Come! Come!

1099
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:25,568
His death must be public.

1100
01:29:25,651 --> 01:29:27,153
Public? [grunts]

1101
01:29:27,236 --> 01:29:30,114
Hang his entrails
from the city gates!

1102
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:31,866
And crucify her!

1103
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:33,993
Crucify her!

1104
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:35,995
Take them away!

1105
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:39,540
-[Caracalla yells]
-[Geta] Shh! Shh! Shh!

1106
01:29:52,595 --> 01:29:53,846
Thank you, Macrinus.

1107
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:01,521
Come on.

1108
01:30:04,857 --> 01:30:06,734
In these last days,

1109
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:10,071
I have come to think of you
not as a subject

1110
01:30:10,154 --> 01:30:12,365
but as a true friend.

1111
01:30:12,448 --> 01:30:14,117
Thank you.

1112
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,869
Thank you so much.
But as a friend,

1113
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:19,705
I must counsel caution.

1114
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:22,875
Acacius is a hero of Rome.

1115
01:30:23,626 --> 01:30:27,130
Crucifixion
is for thieves.

1116
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:28,423
Christians.

1117
01:30:29,465 --> 01:30:32,468
-It's too common.
-He is a traitor. He must die.

1118
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:33,928
I agree.

1119
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:39,851
Let the gods decide
his fate in the Colosseum.

1120
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:47,859
Let the gods decide.

1121
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:54,699
You know, last night I woke,
dreaming of a dark river.

1122
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,119
This time,
for the first time,

1123
01:30:58,202 --> 01:30:59,787
I was crossing it.

1124
01:31:00,496 --> 01:31:02,165
[Ravi] Hm.

1125
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:04,750
Well, you know,
where I come from,

1126
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:07,837
crossing a river,
it represents forgiveness.

1127
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:10,923
Represents... salvation.

1128
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:14,093
Where I come from,
it means you're already dead.

1129
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:16,971
[chuckles]

1130
01:31:22,351 --> 01:31:24,979
But as I saw it,
I was not afraid.

1131
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:28,274
For...

1132
01:31:28,357 --> 01:31:31,319
For someone was waiting
for me on the other side.

1133
01:31:32,862 --> 01:31:34,697
There. [sniffs]

1134
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:46,501
Who is this man?

1135
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:49,295
Scratched out?

1136
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:52,256
Maximus.

1137
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:57,011
I saw him fight once.

1138
01:31:57,970 --> 01:31:59,555
-He was magnificent.
-Mm.

1139
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:02,600
Yeah. My time in the arena,
it was after his,

1140
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:06,979
but many still talked of him
in whispers, you know?

1141
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:09,357
Spoke of him.

1142
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:11,776
What he did.

1143
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:13,861
I met him once.

1144
01:32:15,571 --> 01:32:17,198
He was kind.

1145
01:32:19,408 --> 01:32:21,369
He bowed to no one.

1146
01:32:24,747 --> 01:32:26,415
Come with me.

1147
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:29,627
-Hmm?
-Come. With me.

1148
01:32:48,604 --> 01:32:52,817
When a rebel gladiator dies,
we bury them here.

1149
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:57,405
"What we do in life
echoes in eternity."

1150
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:16,882
This is Argento.

1151
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:18,593
This is Scatto.

1152
01:33:25,641 --> 01:33:28,686
[cheering, applause]

1153
01:33:31,647 --> 01:33:34,317

[horns playing fanfare]

1156
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:00,635
Cheers.

1157
01:34:01,218 --> 01:34:02,720
And stop.

1158
01:34:04,263 --> 01:34:08,351
For his treason
against the lives

1159
01:34:08,434 --> 01:34:12,521
of the emperors
and the Roman state,

1160
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:16,067
General Justus Acacius,

1161
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,363
an enemy of the people!

[all chanting]
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

-[man] We love you, Acacius!
-You are a hero!

1164
01:34:26,702 --> 01:34:29,789
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

[announcer] From the
vanquished city of Numidia,

the victor of two conquests
in the Colosseum...

1179

Go now. Vae victis.

Oh, Lord, any honor I have,

-I will give it to you!
-It's too late.

1184

[announcer]
The Roman traitor or

the barbarian hero.

01:36:13,142 --> 01:36:14,935
Let the gods decide.

1187
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:16,812
Lucius... wait.

I am a vessel.

1192
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:35,831
Fill me with vengeance

1193
01:36:36,707 --> 01:36:39,043
and vanquish the betrayer.

[Acacius]
I know who you are.

Lucius Verus Aurelius.

Acacius
has raised his hand!

1212
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:05,796
He has surrendered.

1214
01:38:13,345 --> 01:38:15,431

[monkey screeching]

1216
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,868
The gods have rendered
their judgment.

1217
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:40,497
Do what you must.

1218
01:38:41,498 --> 01:38:44,001
But on my death,
you have to know...

1219
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:47,796
I love your mother,
Lucilla.

1220
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:50,633
And your father...

1221
01:38:53,302 --> 01:38:54,428
Maximus.

1222
01:38:55,638 --> 01:38:57,806
I would have died
for him.

1223
01:38:57,890 --> 01:38:59,767
Kill him!

1224

Please!

No!

Acacius!

1242
01:39:50,067 --> 01:39:52,069
Damn you!

1243
01:39:52,152 --> 01:39:53,904
[breath heaving]

1244
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:55,948
Death will be
too good for you!

1245
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:04,665
Is this how Rome
treats its heroes?

1246
01:40:08,585 --> 01:40:10,170
Tell me!

1247
01:40:12,172 --> 01:40:16,760
If his life has no value,
what are yours worth?

1248
01:40:16,844 --> 01:40:21,890
The gods have spoken!

1249

[crowd booing]

1253
01:40:54,923 --> 01:40:58,052
For our own safety,
we should return to the palace.

[crowd booing loudly]

[Lucius, faintly] Arishat!

[door opens]

1263
01:42:31,812 --> 01:42:33,438
We had a bargain.

1264
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:40,279
I gave him to you.
You let him live.

1265
01:42:40,362 --> 01:42:42,030
And you got
what you wanted.

1266
01:42:42,114 --> 01:42:44,741
I always get what I want.
Why did you let him live?

1267
01:42:44,825 --> 01:42:47,786
You bought a gladiator,
not a slave.

1268
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:51,290
My will is my own.

1269
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:54,835
Ah...

1270
01:42:54,918 --> 01:42:57,588
How blue is your blood?

1271
01:42:57,671 --> 01:43:00,257
Perhaps the heart of a Roman

1272
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:02,676
beats in that chest.
[chuckles]

1273
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:11,143
The greatest temple
Rome ever built.

1274
01:43:11,226 --> 01:43:12,769
The Colosseum.

1275
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:15,189
Because this is
what they believe in.

1276
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:16,899
Power.

1277
01:43:16,982 --> 01:43:19,693
They gather here to watch
the strong strike down the weak.

-There has to be something else.
-There is nothing else.

1279

-There has to be another Rome.
-There is no other Rome.

1280
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:27,618
-The "dream"?
-Mm.

1281
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:29,620
The dream of Rome?

1282
01:43:29,703 --> 01:43:31,330
It's an old man's fantasy.

1283
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,499
Who are you?

1284
01:43:37,461 --> 01:43:40,589
What was your name before you
traded it for a Roman one?

1285
01:43:41,548 --> 01:43:43,091
You'll never know.

1286
01:43:45,802 --> 01:43:47,512
I have a destiny.

1287
01:43:50,891 --> 01:43:53,352
The gods delivered you to me.

1288
01:43:56,271 --> 01:43:57,981
You will be my instrument.

1289
01:43:58,065 --> 01:44:01,485
I will never be your instrument,
in this life or the next.

1290
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:12,955
-[door opening]
-That will not be my destiny.

1291
01:44:14,873 --> 01:44:16,541
But I will see your end.

1292
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:19,253
[people shouting,
yelling in distance]

1293

[monkey chittering]

1294
01:44:37,562 --> 01:44:39,439
What else could I do?

1295
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:41,316
He and his bitch
were plotting to kill us.

1296
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:44,069
Don't you hear them?
They're calling for our heads!

1297
01:44:44,152 --> 01:44:46,196
The Praetorians
will put down this crowd.

1298
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,031
-Like they have every other.
-You brought this on us.

1299
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:50,659
-Filthy ape!
-[monkey squeaking in fear]

1300
01:44:54,204 --> 01:44:56,957
[Macrinus]
Perhaps you should, uh,

1301
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:01,503
take Dondus elsewhere
to comfort him?

1302
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:13,348
Forgive
my brother's outburst.

1303
01:45:15,142 --> 01:45:16,685
The disease
that infects his loins

1304
01:45:16,768 --> 01:45:18,729
has spread to his brain.

1305
01:45:18,812 --> 01:45:21,940
-Every day he gets worse.
-I will reason with him.

[all yelling, shouting]

01:45:30,991 --> 01:45:33,535
[Dondus hooting]

1308
01:45:38,206 --> 01:45:41,335
[singsong] I see you.

1309
01:45:41,418 --> 01:45:43,545
I see you.

1310
01:45:44,838 --> 01:45:47,049
Caracalla, Caracalla!

1311
01:45:47,132 --> 01:45:48,759
Come on, stand up.

1312
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:50,927
Get up, get up.
Not you.

1313
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:52,888
All right,
there you go.

1314
01:45:54,514 --> 01:45:56,850
Now, listen to me.

1315
01:45:56,933 --> 01:45:58,518
What's the matter?

1316
01:45:58,602 --> 01:46:01,271
[panting]
Nothing's ever mine.

1317
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:03,690
Everything is ours,
always.

1318

Even in the womb...
[stammering] he tried...

1319
01:46:07,819 --> 01:46:11,156
to cut my umbilicus

1320
01:46:11,239 --> 01:46:13,075
so that I couldn't have
any more air.

1321
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:15,452
-You remember that, do you?
-Certainly.

1322
01:46:15,535 --> 01:46:17,871
-Come, sit.
-One cannot forget.

1323
01:46:17,954 --> 01:46:20,207
My conscience compels me.

1324
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:21,750
What?

1325
01:46:21,833 --> 01:46:23,043
Sit.

1326
01:46:23,126 --> 01:46:24,586
Your brother

1327
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:26,963
means to blame you

1328
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:30,300
in front of
the entire Senate...

1329
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:31,760
But I did not do it!

1330
01:46:31,843 --> 01:46:33,428
...for what's happening
in the streets.

1331
01:46:33,512 --> 01:46:35,889
-The chaos!
-He's lying!

1332
01:46:35,972 --> 01:46:37,808
No testimony
can be more damning

1333
01:46:37,891 --> 01:46:41,353
than one brother
against another.

1334
01:46:41,436 --> 01:46:44,106
That's a lie!
He always lies!

1335
01:46:44,189 --> 01:46:46,650
He can be very persuasive.

1336
01:46:46,733 --> 01:46:49,444
So?
What will they do to me?

1337
01:46:49,528 --> 01:46:52,322
Oh, I don't dare imagine.
But imagine this:

1338
01:46:52,406 --> 01:46:54,533
What will they do to Dondus?

1339
01:46:57,577 --> 01:47:00,414
What will they do

1340
01:47:00,497 --> 01:47:01,873
to Dondus?

Put down the blade.

1347
01:47:49,754 --> 01:47:50,881
You lie.

01:47:50,964 --> 01:47:52,757
-Give it to me.
-You always lie!

1349

Give it-- [grunts]

[Geta exclaiming]

Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

-Lie!
-Listen to me. Break the spell.

-Lie!
-Break the spell!

I've always protected you.
Because I love you.

[hinges creaking]

Never could have imagined
the fates would lead us here.

[Lucius chuckles dryly]

And yet here we are.

01:49:04,496 --> 01:49:06,248
Everything has
brought us full circle.

1366
01:49:06,331 --> 01:49:09,417
You sent me away
and yet fate

1367
01:49:09,501 --> 01:49:12,087
brought me back to the
very ground where he died.

1368

[Lucilla] This ring...

1369
01:49:17,884 --> 01:49:19,678
belonged to my father.

1370
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:26,726
He gave it to your
father, Maximus,

1371
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:28,770
as a token of trust.

1372
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:33,149
I gave it to Acacius
for his valor.

1373
01:49:37,571 --> 01:49:39,864
This ring belonged to my wife.

1374
01:49:42,742 --> 01:49:44,327
I shall wear it next to yours.

1375
01:49:58,508 --> 01:50:01,052
I am truly sorry for Acacius.

1376

I could not see the man.

[sniffles]

1378
01:50:07,267 --> 01:50:09,227
He was a soldier of Rome.

1379
01:50:11,104 --> 01:50:12,564
There was a plan.

1380
01:50:13,773 --> 01:50:15,150
He was readying troops
at Ostia

1381

under the command
of Darius Sextus.

1382
01:50:18,361 --> 01:50:21,489
Troops he was to lead
against the emperors.

Acacius. Maximus.
Marcus Aurelius.

1384
01:50:28,955 --> 01:50:31,416
They lived and died
for Rome.

1385

We all do.

1386

Is it true
they intend to kill you?

One man or another has had
a sword against my neck

since the day
my father died.

1390

But now
that I've found you,

it doesn't matter.

1392
01:50:54,564 --> 01:50:56,316
I am not afraid.

1393
01:50:56,399 --> 01:50:59,569
I've become well versed in
losing the things that I love.

1394

But now that I've found you,

I have no desire
to lose you again.

I wish that were true.

with good fortune
and not a little skill...

I can speak logic to it...

and tame the madness
in the street. But...

to restore order...

[Macrinus] Rome must fall.

I need only
give it a push.

[Lucilla]
And after Rome falls...

1458
01:55:28,379 --> 01:55:30,882
[dry chuckle]
...what then?

1459
01:55:32,926 --> 01:55:35,053
You are
your father's child.

1460
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:40,433
His dream of Rome
was never a dream.

1461
01:55:40,516 --> 01:55:42,560
It was a fiction.

1462

"The best revenge is

to become unlike the one
who did the injury."

1464
01:55:48,983 --> 01:55:53,988
I have made myself
unlike your father.

1465
01:55:54,072 --> 01:55:57,617
He spoke of dreams,
I speak of truth.

1466
01:55:57,700 --> 01:56:00,244
And the only truth
in my Rome

1467
01:56:01,704 --> 01:56:03,831
is the law
of the strongest.

1468
01:56:06,042 --> 01:56:07,502
I was owned

1469

by an emperor.

1470
01:56:13,383 --> 01:56:15,593
Now I control an empire.

1471
01:56:16,552 --> 01:56:19,931
Where else but in Rome
can a man do that?

1472
01:56:25,103 --> 01:56:29,732
Do you recognize
your father's mark on me?

1473
01:56:34,445 --> 01:56:35,863
If there is anything

1474
01:56:36,489 --> 01:56:37,949
you need...

1475
01:56:39,575 --> 01:56:41,369
in these last hours,

1476

we will provide.

Your death will clear my path
to the throne.

Tomorrow
there will be games.

And at them...

1480
01:56:59,846 --> 01:57:01,639
I will prevail.

What is in Ostia?

There is an army.

to risk yourself, my friend,

in the service
of something greater.

[inhales]

1502
01:58:21,594 --> 01:58:22,845
-Should I trust you?
-Yes.

1503
01:58:22,929 --> 01:58:25,098
-Should I?
-Yes.

1504
01:58:31,896 --> 01:58:34,690
Ravi! I need your keys.

1505
01:58:40,696 --> 01:58:42,490
Thank you.

1506
01:59:20,236 --> 01:59:22,780
Stop! Come back!

1507
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:37,336
[panting]

1508
01:59:44,385 --> 01:59:45,678
[inhales sharply]

1509
01:59:53,436 --> 01:59:54,687
Who gave you this?

1510
01:59:55,563 --> 01:59:57,815
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1511
01:59:58,941 --> 02:00:00,276
The Prince of Rome.

1512
02:00:21,631 --> 02:00:23,758
[horses snort, whinnying]

1513

[crowd cheering
in distance]

1514
02:00:53,329 --> 02:00:56,499
[whispering]
Must we kill Lucilla?

1515
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,879
[quietly] Until she dies,
you will never know peace.

1516
02:01:03,673 --> 02:01:04,799
Ever.

1517
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:09,971
[horns playing fanfare]

1518
02:01:15,559 --> 02:01:18,187
The people love her.
Her death will incite the mob.

1519
02:01:18,271 --> 02:01:20,856
If she dies and the streets
rise up in anger,

1520
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:22,441
I shall deliver them
Caracalla's head

1521
02:01:22,525 --> 02:01:23,943
and the people
shall acclaim me.

1522
02:01:24,026 --> 02:01:27,738
That, my friend,
is politics.

1523
02:01:30,449 --> 02:01:32,410
-Shall we?
-Yes.

1524
02:01:47,550 --> 02:01:49,760
Today will be
your last fight, champion.

1525
02:01:50,761 --> 02:01:52,513
And our master
has bestowed on you...

1526
02:01:54,765 --> 02:01:57,268
the wooden sword of freedom.

1527
02:02:01,147 --> 02:02:03,190
But you have to
earn it first.

1528
02:02:03,274 --> 02:02:05,735
Today, you're gonna
defend your mother.

1529
02:02:12,325 --> 02:02:14,535
-[soldier shouting]

[all yelling]

1531
02:02:25,338 --> 02:02:28,466
[grunting explosively]

1532
02:02:28,549 --> 02:02:31,510
Wood or steel,
a point is still a point!

1533
02:02:33,888 --> 02:02:35,723
[arrows whistling]

1534
02:02:58,662 --> 02:03:00,289
[Lucius] Wait for me.

1535
02:03:19,016 --> 02:03:20,768
In honor

1536
02:03:20,851 --> 02:03:25,189
of the acclamation
of Emperor Caracalla,

1537
02:03:25,272 --> 02:03:31,237
First Consul Dondus
and Second Consul Macrinus,

1538
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:35,866
and as punishment for her
conspiracy against the empire,

1539
02:03:35,950 --> 02:03:40,454
for her calumnies against
the emperor's imperial bloodline

1540
02:03:40,538 --> 02:03:42,790
and for fomenting
military mutiny

1541
02:03:42,873 --> 02:03:44,375
along with her husband,

1542
02:03:44,458 --> 02:03:48,129
the queen will face
divine justice

1543
02:03:48,212 --> 02:03:52,425
at the hands
of the Praetorian Guard.

1544
02:03:56,554 --> 02:03:59,098
[crowd cheering faintly]

1545
02:04:16,782 --> 02:04:18,409
I am not a general.

1546
02:04:19,994 --> 02:04:23,622
But we are all soldiers.

1547
02:04:25,499 --> 02:04:27,293
And up until now,

1548
02:04:27,376 --> 02:04:31,672
we have fought for nothing more
than another day's survival.

1549
02:04:31,755 --> 02:04:33,716
What will you
have us do?

1550
02:04:34,925 --> 02:04:36,177
Well, you can return
to your cells

1551
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:38,304
if you do not wish
to fight this battle.

1552
02:04:38,387 --> 02:04:40,806
-[all laughing]
-Or...

1553
02:04:42,433 --> 02:04:43,893
you can join me.

1554
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:47,480
And fight for a freedom
far beyond these walls.

1555
02:04:47,563 --> 02:04:49,148
[all] Aye!

1556
02:04:49,231 --> 02:04:53,527
There once was a time when
honor meant something in Rome.

1557
02:04:55,112 --> 02:04:56,739
In this Rome

1558
02:04:57,531 --> 02:04:59,700
I no longer believe
that exists.

1559
02:04:59,783 --> 02:05:01,785
We must find it!

1560
02:05:01,869 --> 02:05:03,954
[all murmuring in agreement]

1561
02:05:04,038 --> 02:05:05,831
[Lucius] And know this:

1562
02:05:07,041 --> 02:05:10,920
Where death is, we are not.

1563
02:05:12,796 --> 02:05:14,840
Where we are,

1564
02:05:15,466 --> 02:05:17,301
death is not!

1565
02:05:20,221 --> 02:05:21,597
By my sword.

1566
02:05:23,390 --> 02:05:25,142
Strength and honor.

1567
02:05:25,226 --> 02:05:27,186
[all] Strength and honor!

1568
02:05:27,269 --> 02:05:28,938
Strength and honor!

1569
02:05:29,021 --> 02:05:30,981
Strength and honor!

1570
02:05:40,449 --> 02:05:43,077

[snarling]

1573
02:05:55,589 --> 02:05:57,716
Let it not be said

1574
02:05:57,800 --> 02:06:00,928
that the emperor
is not merciful.

1575
02:06:01,011 --> 02:06:06,517
The queen will be granted
a single gladiator

1576
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:10,396
to defend her against
the Praetorian Guard.

1577
02:06:10,479 --> 02:06:12,773
[crowd jeering]

1578
02:06:20,364 --> 02:06:24,368
The champion, Hanno!

[crowd roars]

[grunting]

1584
02:07:37,358 --> 02:07:39,193
Yes!

1585
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:45,240
Summon the cavalry.
Put this down at once.

1586
02:07:46,659 --> 02:07:49,161
This is war! Real war!

1587
02:07:53,999 --> 02:07:57,503
The army of Acacius is advancing
just outside of Rome, sir.

1588
02:08:00,047 --> 02:08:01,507
We can still
outflank them.

1589
02:08:01,590 --> 02:08:04,051
They have only
5,000 troops, no more.

1590
02:08:05,302 --> 02:08:06,804
How many are we?

1591
02:08:06,887 --> 02:08:08,263
Six thousand.
Perhaps more.

1592
02:08:08,347 --> 02:08:10,015
Ride to the gate
and hold them.

1593

[Lucilla] Lucius!

1603
02:09:20,002 --> 02:09:21,170
Give me the bow.

[both gasp]

1606
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:47,404
Go, my son. Lucius--

1607
02:09:47,488 --> 02:09:48,614
Shh-sh-sh-sh...

1608
02:09:48,697 --> 02:09:50,157
Horse!

[man shouting cadence]

1614
02:11:22,875 --> 02:11:25,002
Will nothing
kill this barbarian?

1615
02:11:25,085 --> 02:11:27,629
My name is
Lucius Verus Aurelius!

1616
02:11:27,713 --> 02:11:30,090
[Macrinus] A man does not become
emperor by bloodline alone.

1617
02:11:30,173 --> 02:11:32,926
It must be taken by force
and kept by force.

1618
02:11:33,010 --> 02:11:34,845
Are you such a man
as this?

1619
02:11:34,928 --> 02:11:36,388
[Lucius]
I don't fight for power.

1620
02:11:36,471 --> 02:11:39,224
I fight to free Rome
from men like you

1621
02:11:39,308 --> 02:11:40,809
and to return it to them.

1622
02:11:40,893 --> 02:11:43,729
The gods themselves
want Rome reborn.

1623
02:11:43,812 --> 02:11:46,773
They sent me...
to fulfill that task.

1624
02:11:46,857 --> 02:11:50,444
And what if your gods
sent me here to kill you?

1625
02:11:50,527 --> 02:11:51,653
Huh?

1626
02:11:52,696 --> 02:11:54,990
It's time to end this, Macrinus!

1627
02:11:55,073 --> 02:11:57,117
[aggressive yell]

[metallic clangs echoing]

1636
02:13:03,100 --> 02:13:04,685
[Lucilla]
Strength and honor,

1637
02:13:05,185 --> 02:13:06,812
my son.

1638
02:13:09,064 --> 02:13:10,232

[pained groan]

1643
02:14:40,072 --> 02:14:41,907
You look to me to speak.

1644
02:14:43,992 --> 02:14:45,702
I know not what
to say other than

1645
02:14:45,786 --> 02:14:47,913
we have all known
too much death.

1646
02:14:49,039 --> 02:14:52,667
Let no more blood be spilt
in the name of tyranny.

1647
02:14:56,505 --> 02:14:59,049
My grandfather,
Marcus Aurelius,

1648
02:14:59,132 --> 02:15:02,094
talked of a dream
that would be Rome.

1649
02:15:03,011 --> 02:15:05,013
A dream that my father,

1650
02:15:06,139 --> 02:15:08,975
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

1651
02:15:09,059 --> 02:15:10,685
died for.

1652
02:15:11,812 --> 02:15:13,522
An ideal.

1653
02:15:16,149 --> 02:15:20,529
A city for the many and a
refuge for those in need.

1654
02:15:20,612 --> 02:15:23,198
A home worth fighting for.

1655
02:15:24,199 --> 02:15:28,620
A home that Maximus
spent his life defending.

1656
02:15:30,580 --> 02:15:32,541
That dream is lost.

1657
02:15:38,380 --> 02:15:40,132
But dare we...

1658
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:44,302
rebuild that dream
together?

1659
02:15:56,106 --> 02:15:57,983
What say you?

1660
02:16:04,239 --> 02:16:06,199
Aye!

1661
02:16:07,242 --> 02:16:08,660
Aye!

1662
02:16:09,286 --> 02:16:10,537
Aye!

1663
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:15,083
[all] Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye!

1664
02:16:17,294 --> 02:16:20,797
