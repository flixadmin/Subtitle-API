00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:05,137
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:08,207
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:10,809
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

5
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:12,144
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:14,146
<i>Unfortunately,
my plan is opposed</i>

7
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:16,582
<i>by the body I'd sworn
my allegiance to:</i>

8
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:18,050
<i>the Time Masters.</i>

9
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:20,252
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

10
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,020
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

11
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,691
<i>they will be
remembered as legends.</i>

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,927
<i>Previously, on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

13
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,396
The Time Masters
discourage marriage,

14
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:37,102
<i>But I fell in love
and we had a child, Jonas.</i>

15
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,571
- Maybe we could get a drink?
- Are you asking me out?

16
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:41,073
Yes. Is that okay?

17
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:42,674
I think my life's
complicated enough

18
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:45,611
Without throwing
whatever this is into the mix.

19
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:48,880
- This is Star City.
- Yes, Star City, 2046.

20
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,682
It's everything
we've ever wanted.

21
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,584
We could live like kings here.

22
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,622
You son of a bitch.

23
00:00:56,624 --> 00:01:00,092
You lay a hand on me again,
you'll burn too.

24
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,395
<i>Go ahead, Jonas.</i>

25
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,497
<i>He's listening.</i>

26
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,532
<i>Hi, daddy. We miss you.</i>

27
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:11,136
<i>- And love you.
- And love you.</i>

28
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,572
<i>Anything else
you want to say?</i>

29
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:17,142
<i>Come home soon, daddy.</i>

30
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,879
<i>Hi, Rip.</i>

31
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,015
<i>Not sure if you got
our last message.</i>

32
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:24,783
<i>I told Jonas that you got
caught up with work,</i>

33
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:29,354
<i>but I really thought
you'd be home by now.</i>

34
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:32,324
<i>London is...</i>

35
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,293
<i>Things have changed.</i>

36
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:35,861
<i>It's hard to tell
what's going on</i>

37
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:39,931
<i>With so many soldiers
and rumors.</i>

38
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,702
<i>I just want to know
you're all right.</i>

39
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,904
<i>Wherever you are,</i>

40
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:49,574
<i>Whenever you are,</i>

41
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,944
<i>I love you, Rip.</i>

42
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,682
<i>Go ahead, Jonas.
He's listening.</i>

43
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,884
<i>Hi, daddy. We miss you.</i>

44
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:01,053
<i>- And love you.
- And love you.</i>

45
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:02,587
I'm sorry
to interrupt, Captain.

46
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:06,191
No, uh, not at all.
Just, uh, catching up on work.

47
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,092
What is all this?

48
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,393
Just trying
to connect the dots,

49
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:12,130
Find the optimal time
to strike at Savage.

50
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,398
And?

51
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,966
And the trail's gone cold.

52
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,935
In order to preserve
the element of surprise,

53
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,170
I wager the best
course of action

54
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:20,072
Is to travel
further back in time,

55
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:23,108
But nothing here indicates
where to find him.

56
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,743
Perhaps I
can help you look.

57
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:28,013
I've been looking!

58
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,681
I apologize.

59
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,850
It's just the stakes
are so high.

60
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:35,854
I vowed to save my family,
but I'm failing them.

61
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:40,359
Perhaps I'm not
the Time Master they need.

62
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:42,894
You must be.

63
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,696
You're the only one they have.

64
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,096
- Can't Gideon help us?
- No.

65
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:49,901
When a timeship returns
to the vanishing point

66
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,803
After a mission,
its CPU is updated

67
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,004
From the temporal database,

68
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:57,175
Which, given my rogue status,

69
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,410
We are unable to do.

70
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,578
So, what you're saying is

71
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,914
Gideon requires
a software update.

72
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,283
Which explains why you've been
holed up in here

73
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,385
For the past week.

74
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:10,255
- Has it really been a week?
- Mm-hmm.

75
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:13,859
And some of our teammates
are getting just a tad antsy.

76
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,330
I'm done.

77
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,232
Don't mind him.

78
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,701
He's still sore
about having to leave 2046.

79
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,970
I'm sore because
I was recruited

80
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,372
For my unique ability
to light things on fire.

81
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,208
And now, I'm locked
in the one place

82
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,577
Where I can't light things
on fire:

83
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,912
A spaceship.

84
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:37,115
Where do you think
you're going?

85
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,450
Why?

86
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:41,086
You gonna clock me in the head
if I don't listen again?

87
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,826
Everything okay with you two?

88
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,362
Yeah, peachy.

89
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,997
<i>Captain,
I've just intercepted</i>

90
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,498
<i>A deep space transmission.</i>

91
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,330
<i>It's a distress signal
from the Acheron.</i>

92
00:03:55,332 --> 00:03:56,802
- <i>She's the...</i>
- flagship of the time fleet.

93
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:59,104
Yes, I know that.
Thank you, Gideon.

94
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,906
<i>Systemic malfunction.</i>

95
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,607
<i>I'm stranded, unable to jump.</i>

96
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,209
<i>Controls unresponsive.</i>

97
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,011
<i>This is Captain Eve Baxter</i>

98
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,512
<i>of the timeship Acheron,</i>

99
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,849
<i>requesting critical rescue.</i>

100
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,453
And we care about
this chick why?

101
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,388
We don't,
but the Acheron's computer

102
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,658
Will contain the current intel
on Savage's whereabouts.

103
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,293
Gideon, set a course

104
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,161
for the Acheron's position
in deep space.

105
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,996
<i>- Yes, Captain.
- Deep space?</i>

106
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,465
I had no idea we had the ability

107
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:29,197
to explore the unknown realms
of the galaxy.

108
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,769
- Astonishing.
- No.

109
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,304
What's astonishing
is that we're acting

110
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,606
as roadside assistance
for the people who's chasing us.

111
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,174
Doesn't it seem suspicious,

112
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:39,878
this distress call just
happened to reach us?

113
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,146
How do we know
it's not a trap?

114
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,514
We don't, but
what we do know

115
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,216
is that Savage's trail
has run cold.

116
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,884
And unless Gideon
can upload the data

117
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,887
- from the Acheron's computer...
- I'm in.

118
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,088
You are?

119
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,523
The sooner we end Savage,
the sooner

120
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:54,292
- I get back to where I belong.
- Prison?

121
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,662
Any prison on Earth's
better than this one, Professor.

122
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,532
- Gideon.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

123
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,000
Engines to full throttle.

124
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,069
<i>Of course, Captain.</i>

125
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,294
Professor Stein,
Mr. Jackson,

126
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:30,962
Would you care to join
the boarding party?

127
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,697
A chance for an
extra-vehicular

128
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,000
Docking maneuver?
What could be more exciting?

129
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,334
I could think of a few things.

130
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,871
Let's get this thing started.

131
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,706
Hey, you think
there's something

132
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,408
Worth stealing on that ship?

133
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,877
I'm just looking
for a change of scenery.

134
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,847
If that's okay with you, boss.

135
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,315
Dr. Palmer.

136
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,918
I leave the ship
in your hands while we're gone.

137
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,288
And I leave him in yours.

138
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,433
I'm having
the strangest sensation.

139
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,335
It's like I'm
ten years old again.

140
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,671
You do a lot of space travel
as a kid, Professor?

141
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:15,006
Only in my dreams,
after I read

142
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,943
My first issue of
"Rick Starr: Space Ranger".

143
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:20,812
Space Ranger Stein?
Yeah, I don't see it.

144
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,248
I wanted
to travel through space,

145
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,650
Surviving only by
my wits and laser guns.

146
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:30,053
I even built a rocket
out of cardboard boxes.

147
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,523
What stopped you?

148
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,959
NASA has rather strict
guidelines regarding

149
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:36,027
- nearsightedness.
- And smoking weed.

150
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,762
Gideon, have you been able
to link up

151
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,097
to the Acheron's computer?

152
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,765
<i>It appears
a self-destruct code</i>

153
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,134
<i>has disabled the ship's
temporal navigation system.</i>

154
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,636
Well, what does that mean?

155
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,072
It's possibly the result
of a malfunction.

156
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,007
Just in case, Martin,
I'm going to ask you

157
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,609
to remain behind here
on the jump ship.

158
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,477
You're telling us
if something goes wrong,

159
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,912
Egghead's in charge?

160
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,380
Break out the emergency gear.

161
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:58,850
Space Ranger has a job to do.

162
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:02,053
<i>Rip? Rip, I need an update.</i>

163
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,788
How about this update?

164
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,424
They've boarded the ship!

165
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,194
- We've been overrun!
- Excellent.

166
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:12,631
Perhaps you're not
taking this seriously, Miranda.

167
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,132
- Gary?
<i>- Yes, Captain?</i>

168
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,934
Be a dear and open the
portside bulkhead, would you?

169
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,569
Look,
I enjoy a suicide mission

170
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,938
As much as the next person...
you heard me, Gary.

171
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,573
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

172
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:22,841
What's the plan here?

173
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,442
Rip, you might want to grab
hold of something.

174
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,277
Yes, I am!
It's called a gun!

175
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,080
Something else.
Do it, please.

176
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:31,883
Now, Gary.

177
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,688
<i>Gamma-delta hatch opened.</i>

178
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,257
<i>Explosive decompression
has evacuated the time pirates.</i>

179
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,460
Seal hatch, engage time drive,
and punch it.

180
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,906
Well done,
Lieutenant Coburn.

181
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,808
Well done?
She nearly got us killed.

182
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,544
The simulation equivalent,
at least.

183
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,446
She demonstrated
unconventional thinking

184
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,481
Against overwhelming numbers.

185
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,183
You could learn a thing
or two from her,

186
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,185
Lieutenant Hunter.

187
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,994
Declan was right.

188
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,164
Teach me more.

189
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,370
Sir, I can explain.

190
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,138
Don't bother, Lieutenant.

191
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,475
Save it for
your disciplinary hearing.

192
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,216
Hey, hey, hey.
We can figure this out.

193
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,518
- We'll get through this together.
- That's just it.

194
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,154
We can't be together.
We knew from the start.

195
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,556
relationships
are strictly forbidden.

196
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:47,125
There has to be
a way to fix this.

197
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:50,195
I'm sorry.

198
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,798
I need some time to think.

199
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,817
Stay close and stay alert.

200
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,423
To quote
every "Star Wars" ever made,

201
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,458
"I've got
a bad feeling about this."

202
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,049
Valiant effort.

203
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,685
Let the man go.

204
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,857
Or else what?

205
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,593
Do as the man says.

206
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,864
Who the hell are these guys?

207
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,801
These, Mr. Jackson,

208
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,803
Are time pirates.

209
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,187
- Captain John Valor.
- Oh.

210
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,389
What happened to Captain Baxter?

211
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,291
She was on her way
back to the vanishing point

212
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,259
To imprison us
when we made our escape.

213
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,094
But before we could
take control of the Acheron...

214
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,831
She destroyed her time drive
in accordance with protocol.

215
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,132
The same protocol that said

216
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,367
Another Time Master
would come to her rescue.

217
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,369
Do I look
like a Time Master to you?

218
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,737
You look like
the kind of man who'd

219
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,072
Throw his grandmother
out of an airlock.

220
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,340
Nor am I a Time Master,

221
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:45,577
So you might as well just
let us go.

222
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,347
Correct me if I'm wrong.

223
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,850
You're Rip friggin' Hunter.

224
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,351
I thought you'd be taller.

225
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:54,886
You never said
you were famous.

226
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:56,087
Infamous.

227
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,288
There was a time when he had
men like me

228
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,723
Running scared
all along the timeline.

229
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,558
Unless you let
us return to our ship,

230
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,062
A man named Vandal Savage
will destroy the entire world.

231
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,864
Time masters and pirates alike.

232
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:10,301
For once, we're fighting
on the same side.

233
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:13,438
That little slogan
should come with its own shovel.

234
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,940
- Prepare a boarding party!
- Yes, sir.

235
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,977
If I were you, I'd reconsider
your plan, Mr. Valor.

236
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,645
Really?

237
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,747
I gave my crew instructions
to shoot any boarding vessel,

238
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,449
Along with the ship
launching it.

239
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,050
With the great
Rip Hunter on board?

240
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,886
I highly doubt it.

241
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,587
You don't know my crew.

242
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,056
They're iron-willed
and battle-hardened.

243
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:37,161
The most formidable warriors
to navigate time and space.

244
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,265
Captain's log.
Stardate 837.9.

245
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,133
We're awaiting word
from the away team

246
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,301
Aboard the Acheron.

247
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:44,369
I hate to break it to you,

248
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,005
But you're no Captain Kirk.

249
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,573
You're Picard.

250
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,441
But Picard was cautious,

251
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,076
Pontificating, sort of sexless.

252
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,811
Well, tell that to Vash.

253
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:57,916
And for the record, Picard was
way hotter than Kirk.

254
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,185
Ooh, Mick had it wrong.

255
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,955
This ship isn't a prison.
It's a torture chamber.

256
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,958
Well, I don't think
Mick's problem is with the ship.

257
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,426
You think it's with me.

258
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,994
You did knock him out
and force him to leave

259
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:14,866
2046 Star City, which is like
Disneyland for felons.

260
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,100
He'll get over it.

261
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,069
Mick runs hot.
He always has.

262
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,139
Once he calms down, everything
will be back to normal.

263
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:24,943
Yeah, I bet that one sounded
more convincing in your head.

264
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,646
<i>I'd like to speak to
acting Captain Raymond Palmer.</i>

265
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:32,317
Ooh. Acting Captain.
I like the sound of that.

266
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,985
I'm Captain Palmer.
Who are you?

267
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,654
<i>I'm the man
holding your crew hostage.</i>

268
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,423
<i>Captain Palmer,
I've informed Mr. Valor</i>

269
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:41,559
Of the fiery retribution
you'll rain down upon him

270
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,028
If we are not released
immediately.

271
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,530
Mm.

272
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,668
I'm gonna
make this real simple.

273
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,904
You surrender your ship,
and I'll drop you off unharmed

274
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,666
At a place and time
of your choosing.

275
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:58,509
- You've got 10 seconds to decide.
- Or else what?

276
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,911
If you want the Waverider
for yourself,

277
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,579
<i>There's no way
you'll fire on us.</i>

278
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,014
Perhaps, but right now,

279
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,716
I've got my sights set
on your Captain's head.

280
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,017
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Okay.

281
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,052
Just give me a chance
to negotiate.

282
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,921
<i>Ten... Nine...</i>

283
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,422
- Maybe he's bluffing.
<i>- Eight...</i>

284
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,524
- Doesn't feel like it.
- Seven...

285
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,960
You don't know Palmer,

286
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:19,230
And how he survived
the "imperiex" onslaught.

287
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:22,800
Uh, Gideon?

288
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,335
<i>Captain Hunter programmed me</i>

289
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:25,703
<i>to execute certain protocols</i>

290
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,505
<i>in response
to specific keywords.</i>

291
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:28,606
What does that mean
in English?

292
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,008
<i>Strap yourselves in.</i>

293
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,078
<i>We are on the move
and preparing to fire.</i>

294
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,920
Great Scott!
We're under attack!

295
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,956
Gideon, who's firing at us?
<i>Captain's orders.</i>

296
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,158
- Palmer, you idiot!
<i>- No, Captain Hunter's.</i>

297
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,626
<i>Attacking the pirates
who've taken the rest</i>

298
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:49,961
<i>of the boarding party hostage.</i>

299
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,130
- Pirates?
- What are you doing, Gideon?

300
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,298
<i>Just a warning shot to let
them know we mean business.</i>

301
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,268
My partner's on that ship.

302
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,570
D... Dr. Palmer?

303
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,473
Captain Hunter?
Is anyone there?

304
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,444
It's up to you now, Martin.

305
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,980
- Gilbert!
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

306
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:11,983
Set a pursuit course
and prepare to return fire.

307
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:19,957
If you destroy the Waverider,

308
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,492
None of us are getting
back home.

309
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,528
Don't worry.
I'm only targeting

310
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,731
Your ship's life
support systems.

311
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:34,338
Now, if I were the weapons
targeting system

312
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,208
On the Acheron...

313
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,079
Where would I be?

314
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,685
<i>There's a hull breach
in the aft portion of the ship,</i>

315
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,154
<i>And the pirates have taken out
the telemetry controls.</i>

316
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,090
Gideon, switch to manual.

317
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,558
What are you doing?

318
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,294
If this is anything
like a video game,

319
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,663
Flying a space ship.

320
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,398
Where are you guys going?

321
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,966
To deal with the hole
in the ship.

322
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,969
Make sure Picard here
doesn't get us all killed.

323
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:07,438
Actually,
I'm more like Sulu right now.

324
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,408
Or Han Solo!

325
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,586
Target their thrusters
and fire.

326
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,224
I said fire!

327
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:29,460
Sir, the weapons systems
have been taken offline.

328
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,029
- Manually.
- Who else is on my ship?

329
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,332
Oh, a good Captain
keeps his best weapons hidden

330
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,800
From his enemies, Mr. Valor.

331
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,169
Find the saboteur!
Bring him to me, dead or alive.

332
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,037
I guess we'll just have
to follow your friends

333
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,405
Till they're out of air.

334
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,673
Shouldn't take too long,
given the size

335
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,275
Of the hole in the hull.

336
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,847
Here.

337
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,985
Hail the crew
of the Waverider.

338
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:56,621
Rip, tell your crew
to let us board,

339
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,256
And I will happily save them.

340
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:01,759
But either way,
we are taking the Waverider.

341
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,928
Take the damn deal, Rip.

342
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,131
A Captain never
surrenders his ship.

343
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,866
Besides, you'll never
catch Captain Palmer.

344
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,402
He once outran
Kanjar Ro himself.

345
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,037
Who's Kanjar Ro?

346
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,805
<i>Engaging protocol
now, Captain.</i>

347
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,375
- Awesome.
<i>- I wasn't talking to you.</i>

348
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,782
What the hell
happened to 'em?

349
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,784
We were following
a holographic projection

350
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,420
Which allowed the Waverider
to slip away.

351
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:30,855
Giving secret commands
to your crew.

352
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,490
- Very clever, Captain.
- Mmhmm.

353
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,692
Throw them in the brig!

354
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,161
We'll find your friends' bodies.

355
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,063
Eventually.

356
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,865
How long
can you keep that up for?

357
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:41,832
Not long.

358
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,403
I'm gonna run out of charge.

359
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:49,640
<i>Be advised, the breach
is only partially contained.</i>

360
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,911
Guess we know
the bulkhead doors are working.

361
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:56,948
Too bad we're on
the wrong side of them.

362
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,960
Uh oh.

363
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,361
Thanks for stopping by.

364
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,796
We're gonna get you
out of here.

365
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,864
- Just hang tight.
- Is there another option?

366
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,999
Don't mean
to rush you, Raymond,

367
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,467
But it's getting cold in here.

368
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,002
Normally I
wouldn't complain, but...

369
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,404
Can't you just open
the doors, Gideon?

370
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,472
<i>The bulkhead is designed
to remain shut</i>

371
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:22,873
<i>until the breach is sealed.</i>

372
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,675
Well, that's not happening
from in here.

373
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,177
How much time
do we have until...

374
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,045
We're dead?

375
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,949
Ah!

376
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,985
Ah...

377
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,688
Captain Baxter.
I'm Rip Hunter.

378
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,056
I'm here to rescue you.

379
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,926
I doubt it.
You walked straight into a trap.

380
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,227
I will admit
that we've encountered

381
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,530
Some... Unforeseen obstacles.

382
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,965
Right.

383
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,667
But, we're gonna get you
out of here in a second.

384
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,035
Mr. Jackson, will you please see
what we can do

385
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,703
About disabling
this force field?

386
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:55,273
You don't think
I've tried that?

387
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,541
But by all means,
if you think this <i>kid</i>

388
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,043
Will have better luck.

389
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,245
- Whoa, who you callin' kid?
- I'm sorry.

390
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,681
- I meant criminal.
- Actually, that's me.

391
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,883
All of you.
If we ever do get out of here,

392
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,185
the first thing I'll do
is take you

393
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,653
to the vanishing point
to await trial

394
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,655
before the time council.

395
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:13,524
The great Rip Hunter,

396
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:14,625
but look at you now.

397
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,027
Yes, look at me now.

398
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,828
Helping you break out
of a pirate's brig

399
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,397
aboard your own timeship.

400
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,399
I don't want help from a man
who broke his oath,

401
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:24,435
stole a timeship, and decided
to change history

402
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:28,005
for his own selfish reasons.

403
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,608
Doesn't make any sense to me.

404
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,145
No, I don't expect it would.

405
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:37,615
Rip Hunter.

406
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,618
Miranda Coburn.

407
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,087
Those aren't
your real names, are they?

408
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,555
No, sir.

409
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:47,425
And why is that?

410
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,827
Because if our enemies knew
our true identities,

411
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,929
our ancestors and descendants
across the timeline

412
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,597
could be potential targets.

413
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,200
As well as
anyone else you might love.

414
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,368
Which is why...

415
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,036
Personal attachments
are expressly forbidden

416
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,571
by the council of Time Masters.

417
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:04,208
And grounds for immediate
discharge from service.

418
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,277
Do either of you deny
that you were conducting

419
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:10,448
an illicit affair in violation
of this council's rules?

420
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,851
In that case,

421
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,053
I motion that we adjourn
this disciplinary hearing

422
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:18,356
for one hour to afford you

423
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:21,826
the opportunity
to consider your response.

424
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,961
Though I sincerely doubt
there's any answer

425
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:27,264
you can provide that will
prevent this tribunal

426
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:31,335
from discharging you
both from the Time Masters.

427
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,580
I suppose this feels like
a day at the beach for you?

428
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:43,814
If I had to pick
a way to die,

429
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:46,951
freezing wouldn't be the worst.

430
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,653
What's it like?

431
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,355
Dying?

432
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,692
I imagine you've got
a unique perspective.

433
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,094
You know, it's funny.

434
00:19:57,096 --> 00:20:00,531
I mean, you'd expect
it to be terrifying,

435
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:04,502
just panic and fear.

436
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:07,505
What'd you feel?

437
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,276
I guess lonely.

438
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,245
Yeah.

439
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:18,282
Like everybody I loved
was a million miles away.

440
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:24,188
I mean, I don't like you, but at
least I'm not dying alone.

441
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:29,827
Closest I ever came to dying
was, uh...

442
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,129
The day I met Mick.

443
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:35,800
- Why does that not surprise me?
- It wasn't like that.

444
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,134
It was my first day in juvie.

445
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:40,938
I was 14, and the smallest kid
in there by far.

446
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,775
Some of the older kids
wanted to make sure I knew it.

447
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,245
So they jumped me.

448
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:52,416
I fought back,
but one of them had a shiv

449
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,286
And I figured that was it

450
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:58,122
Until Mick stepped in.

451
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:01,258
And they didn't mess
with me after that.

452
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:06,330
He's been standing up for me
ever since.

453
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:11,035
Let's just hope he's
standing up for Rip and Jax now.

454
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:14,839
Who else is gonna
take on those pirates?

455
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,379
Hey!

456
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,517
<i>Ah!</i>

457
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:37,561
That'll teach you to mess
with a nuclear physicist.

458
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:40,664
You ready?

459
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,533
Given I never designed
the A.T.O.M. suit for outer space,

460
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,835
I'm not exactly sure
how to answer that question.

461
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,437
While I'm gone, you're Captain.

462
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:47,938
Thank you.

463
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,474
But I think we both know
I'm in charge either way.

464
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,410
Good luck.

465
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,947
Gideon, open the hatch.

466
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,826
Sorry, Captain.

467
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,895
I can't Jerry-rig the door open.

468
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:12,229
Don't worry, kid.

469
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:13,998
It's not your fault.
It's his.

470
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,399
In case
you've forgotten, Mr. Rory,

471
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:17,334
You volunteered to be
part of this boarding party.

472
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,070
I volunteered to get
away from my partner,

473
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,906
Who hasn't been
acting like my partner

474
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,941
Ever since you fed his head
with fairy tales

475
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,242
About saving the world.

476
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:26,877
Your partner has a mind
of his own,

477
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,479
Mr. Rory, which is more
than I can say of you.

478
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:30,381
Are you saying
that I'm dumb, Captain?

479
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:32,049
Let's pretend,
just for a moment,

480
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,517
That you're the Captain,

481
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,286
Stuck in the brig
while the rest of your crew

482
00:22:35,288 --> 00:22:38,022
Slowly perish
on their damaged ship.

483
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,657
Now, what would you do
to get yourself

484
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,759
Out of that predicament?

485
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:43,761
Oh, no brilliant ideas?
Really?

486
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,663
Why am I not in
the least bit surprised?

487
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:47,097
Shut your mouth, now!

488
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,166
Okay, let's all just
take a deep breath.

489
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:50,668
Or what?
You'll punch me in the face,

490
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,869
Or burn me alive, or employ

491
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,437
Some other barbaric form
of violence?

492
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:56,040
That's why you recruited me,
isn't it?

493
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,408
To hit, hurt, and burn?

494
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,976
No, I recruited you
because you and your partner

495
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,245
Were a package deal.

496
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:02,613
- What?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Rory.

497
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,381
But a serial arsonist
was never part of my plan

498
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:09,687
To stop Savage, much less one
with the IQ of meat.

499
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:12,122
I didn't mean to be so blunt.

500
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,958
If I could just have
a moment of quiet,

501
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,426
Then perhaps I can think
of a way

502
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:18,495
Of getting us off
this pirate ship.

503
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:23,667
I think
I just beat you to it.

504
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:25,069
Can anyone hear me?

505
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,537
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

506
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,839
Me and the pirates
are gonna have a little parlay.

507
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:31,976
- Do not do this, Rory.
- Too late.

508
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:33,243
What do you want?

509
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,279
I want to speak
to Captain Valor.

510
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:38,549
- About what?
- About a timeship.

511
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:42,086
- I am warning you.
- Shut up!

512
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:45,289
I may have the IQ of meat,

513
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,692
But I know how to cut a deal.

514
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:15,319
I'm listening.

515
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:18,122
You want the Waverider.
I want to go home.

516
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,890
Where is home
for a man like you?

517
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:22,426
2016, Central City.

518
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:25,462
Of all the places
in time, you want to go there?

519
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,830
That's right.

520
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,366
To the exact moment Hunter
recruited me and my partner

521
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:33,103
On this suicidal mission
of his,

522
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:35,072
But, this time,

523
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:37,007
I'm gonna tell him
where to shove it.

524
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,542
Let me get this straight.

525
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,744
I let you go,

526
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,646
You'll deliver the Waverider.

527
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,782
Yes.

528
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:47,284
Do we have an accord?

529
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:48,786
You think your friends
will believe

530
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:52,423
You were able to escape?

531
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:56,260
Not unless I do this.

532
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,765
<i>How's it going out there?</i>

533
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,100
<i>Good.</i>

534
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:05,069
<i>By which I mean
utterly terrifying.</i>

535
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:07,004
<i>I'll have the breach sealed
in two more minutes.</i>

536
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,440
Okay. How's your oxygen level?

537
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:13,243
Uh, I think
the technical term is lousy.

538
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,145
Just two more minutes.

539
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:18,449
You got this.

540
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:20,551
Nothing quite like dying
to make you think

541
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:23,983
About all the mistakes,
all the wrong choices.

542
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,189
Is this Leonard Snart
coming to God

543
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,825
in his final moments?

544
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:30,194
Hardly.

545
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:34,164
Just wishing I could take
a few things back.

546
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:37,101
I should've left Mick
in future Star City.

547
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:39,903
Why didn't you?

548
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:43,373
Without me to keep
him in check,

549
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,377
Mick can be a scary guy.

550
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,378
Agreed.

551
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,980
Hate to break it to you, but

552
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:52,483
Even if we make it
out of here alive,

553
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:55,352
You're still gonna have
a problem on your hands.

554
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:57,154
And I've seen enough to know

555
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:59,356
That Mick's in a dark place.

556
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:02,693
He's not coming back.

557
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:10,067
Man, I can't believe
Rory sold us out.

558
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,569
No, actually I can.

559
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,139
But still, man.

560
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:16,974
What choice did he have?

561
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:19,843
The crew left on the Waverider
are most probably dead by now,

562
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:22,780
And god knows what happened
to Professor Stein.

563
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,481
It's no wonder that Mr. Rory

564
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,850
Chose to save his own skin.

565
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:28,485
And what I can I do about it?

566
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:31,088
I'm stick in a pirate's brig
and I've lost both my ship

567
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,023
And the loyalty of my crew.

568
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:34,958
You're one
to talk about loyalty.

569
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,460
Oh, but I am, Captain Baxter,

570
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:38,128
And not because
I pledged an oath

571
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,798
To serve as a Time Master,

572
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,199
But a long time ago, I made

573
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:45,636
A far more important oath.

574
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:52,576
When you call me a failure,
Captain Baxter, you're right.

575
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:56,747
'Cause I failed
both my wife and my son.

576
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,149
For betraying the time council

577
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:03,287
I have absolutely no regrets.

578
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:08,458
But failing to save my family?

579
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,966
That is something for which
I will never forgive myself.

580
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,708
Time master Declan?

581
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,312
I thought the tribunal
was re-convening.

582
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,180
It's been canceled.

583
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:34,051
Lieutenant Coburn assumed full
responsibility for the affair.

584
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:37,888
The other Time Masters
were moved by her argument.

585
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,456
They've dismissed the charges?

586
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,792
Once Lieutenant Coburn
resigned.

587
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:46,697
- Why would she do that?
- It seems she believes in you.

588
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:49,700
Now you must prove
to yourself and all of us

589
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:53,437
That you are indeed the man
she believes you to be.

590
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,950
I thought we were done for.

591
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:09,019
Take heart, dear Captain.

592
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,520
This battle is far from over.

593
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,056
Now, who would care
to join me

594
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,225
In a daring escape?

595
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:18,695
- Space Ranger.
- Indeed.

596
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:31,808
<i>Ray, don't go
nodding off on me.</i>

597
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,645
No, I wasn't.

598
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:36,280
I was just resting my eyes
for a second.

599
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:37,748
<i>You've got
to stay with me, Ray.</i>

600
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,550
Just stay focused on my voice,
and keep talking.

601
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,854
<i>- About what?
- Anything.</i>

602
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:45,222
Like, um,

603
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:48,158
What was your first pet's name?

604
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,193
- Slinky.
- Is that a cat?

605
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:51,895
Burmese python.

606
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,665
Yeah, I'm allergic to cats
and dogs.

607
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:56,600
<i>Pretty much anything
without scales.</i>

608
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:59,269
Okay, then,
enough about pets.

609
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:02,105
Um, what's your
favorite color?

610
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,507
<i>Don't have one.</i>

611
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:05,008
Who doesn't have
a favorite color?

612
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,677
It's kind of
like having a favorite Beatle.

613
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:09,879
No, everyone
has a favorite Beatle.

614
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:11,182
Not me.

615
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:12,549
Wouldn't be fair
to the other three.

616
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,818
Okay, fine,
enough about pets,

617
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,486
and colors, and Beatles.

618
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,689
It's a good thing
we never went for that drink.

619
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:22,292
This space date
is going terribly.

620
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:28,532
Ray?

621
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,236
Are you still with me, Ray?

622
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,872
<i>Ray? Are you there?</i>

623
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,908
I'm sorry.

624
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,745
It's all I have left.

625
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,351
Ray, are you there?

626
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:49,753
<i>It seems that Mr. Palmer
patched the hole in the hull,</i>

627
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:51,121
<i>allowing Mr. Snart
and Ms. Lance</i>

628
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,589
<i>To escape the engine room.</i>

629
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:54,124
Okay, as soon as he's on
board, I need you

630
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,593
To close the cargo bay
and seal the airlock, Gideon.

631
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:05,035
Ray.

632
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,941
Ray! Hey, stay with me.

633
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:13,543
<i>I'm afraid Mr. Palmer
has gone into cardiac arrest.</i>

634
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,979
Please, I can't lose you too!
Ray, I need you! Please!

635
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:19,716
<i>His chances of survival
are less than 3,720 to 1.</i>

636
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:23,420
Ray!

637
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:26,690
Ray, come on. You're strong.

638
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:29,559
Please, Ray. Come back to me.

639
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:32,529
Ray!

640
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:35,699
Ray!

641
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,765
Could you please stop
punching me in the chest?

642
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:42,972
Why do they always make it seem like
it's a good thing to do in the movies?

643
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,480
I thought you were dead.

644
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:49,713
I think I was, there,
for a second.

645
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:51,415
Thank you.

646
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:54,651
You kids need a moment?

647
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:56,620
You okay?

648
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:58,388
<i>Mr. Palmer nearly died.</i>

649
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,756
Welcome to the club.

650
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:02,759
Gideon, what's happening
on the Acheron?

651
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,161
<i>Funny you should ask.</i>

652
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:05,729
<i>I just received a message
from Mr. Rory.</i>

653
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,197
<i>It seems he escaped capture</i>

654
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,166
<i>And is now returning
to the Waverider.</i>

655
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:10,634
Told you.

656
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:14,004
Those pirates picked
the wrong guy to mess with.

657
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:16,773
Since when does Rory even know
how to fly the jump ship?

658
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:18,375
How did he even find us?

659
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,243
<i>Actually, I did the flying.</i>

660
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:21,378
<i>He received quite a beating</i>

661
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,147
<i>At the hands of the pirates.</i>

662
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:26,483
<i>That's him now.</i>

663
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:42,466
You okay, Mick?

664
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:47,370
Boys!

665
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,240
Ship's all yours!

666
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:59,149
You son of a bitch.

667
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,627
What are you doing, Mick?

668
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:14,798
I'm getting us home.
Are you in?

669
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,806
Yeah.

670
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:26,877
Time to choose a side,
I guess.

671
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,448
Chosen.

672
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,416
Bastard!

673
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,152
Get them!

674
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:37,154
I'll get the time drive.

675
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,026
Is the Acheron's jump ship
still operational?

676
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:44,227
- Yes.
- All right, go to it

677
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:46,096
And get off the Acheron.

678
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,565
I some unfinished business
with Mr. Valor.

679
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:49,833
I'm not leaving my ship.

680
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:52,269
And we're
not leaving you behind.

681
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,004
So what's the plan, Captain?

682
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:57,274
Valor and his men
substantially outnumber us.

683
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:58,642
We're not going to be
able to defeat them

684
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,144
By conventional means.

685
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,522
<i>Mr. Rory is making his way
to the engine room</i>

686
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:13,523
<i>To access the time drive.</i>

687
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,659
I'll handle it.

688
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,485
What's going on?

689
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,821
You're losing.

690
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,325
- Gilbert?
<i>- The time pirates are indeed</i>

691
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:50,060
<i>Ten seconds behind you,
and closing.</i>

692
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:51,595
That doesn't
give us much time.

693
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:53,330
You think
rip's plan will work?

694
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:55,232
Yeah, that's what I thought.

695
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:58,001
Step away from it, Mick.

696
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,370
I'll tell you what, blondie.

697
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,739
Walk away and I won't kill you.

698
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:04,441
You know I can't do that.

699
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:06,476
I like you, Sara.

700
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:09,346
You got a lot of guts.

701
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:12,282
That's why I'm only
gonna kill you a little bit!

702
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,860
Mick!

703
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:03,798
<i>Captain Hunter?
We're in position.</i>

704
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:05,702
- <i>Captain?</i>
- Yes, yes!

705
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:08,271
I'm a little bit busy right now!

706
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:12,809
Be that as it may,
we've run out of time.

707
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:16,279
<i>Captain, the plan.</i>

708
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:23,753
<i>We're waiting
for your signal.</i>

709
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,834
- Gilbert?
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>

710
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:40,203
I need you
to listen to me very,

711
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:41,805
very carefully.

712
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:02,392
Rip! We're good!

713
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:06,629
<i>Bulkhead door closed.</i>

714
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:10,300
<i>Explosive decompression
has evacuated the time pirates.</i>

715
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:12,702
Thank you, Gilbert.

716
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,404
Please hail the Waverider.

717
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:16,873
<i>Waverider,
this is Captain Hunter.</i>

718
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,441
<i>We've regained
control of the Acheron.</i>

719
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,076
<i>What's your status?</i>

720
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:23,413
What are you gonna do,
Snart?

721
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,955
I suppose
it wouldn't be very fair

722
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:33,223
If I arrested you
after you reclaimed my ship

723
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:36,659
And apprehended
John Valor for me.

724
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,629
Happy to help out
a fellow Time Master.

725
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:42,432
Even though I don't
deserve that title.

726
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:45,902
I was wrong.
You've proven that today.

727
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:48,671
You're still one hell
of a Time Master.

728
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:52,242
Which is why I'm
giving you this.

729
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,245
- What's that?
- Gilbert?

730
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:58,181
<i>Using the vanishing point's
most current timeline data,</i>

731
00:36:58,183 --> 00:37:01,050
I calculate a 99.8% probability

732
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,952
<i>That you will find
Vandal Savage</i>

733
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:06,856
<i>In harmony falls, Oregon,
in March of 1958.</i>

734
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:09,659
Thank you, Captain Baxter.

735
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,929
I still don't understand
why you're doing all this.

736
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,164
Before all this started,

737
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:15,899
I don't think
I would've, either.

738
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:18,735
We protect history,
safeguard time itself.

739
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:22,272
There is no higher calling.

740
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:25,375
It's called love.

741
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:28,745
<i>Rip. Rip.</i>

742
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:31,247
Rip!

743
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,817
Look at me, Rip.

744
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,686
Please don't be mad at me.

745
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,721
Oh, no, I'm not mad at you!

746
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:41,691
I... I was going to resign.

747
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:44,928
I know
and I couldn't let you.

748
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,563
This has always been
your dream.

749
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:49,432
Yes, but you are
so much better at this than me.

750
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,901
I... I can't understand
why you would...

751
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:54,137
Why you'd give all that up.

752
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:56,639
It's funny, because you're
the one who made me realize

753
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:59,709
That I could never
be a Time Master.

754
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:01,611
I found something with you,

755
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,180
Something wonderful.

756
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,784
I found love.

757
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:08,985
That thing that the Time Masters

758
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:11,454
Always taught us to hide from,

759
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,956
But they were wrong, Rip.

760
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,258
Love's no threat.

761
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,027
It's beautiful,
and powerful,

762
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:21,531
And once you know it,

763
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:25,335
Love changes everything.

764
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:28,538
Like it changed me

765
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,939
And that's why I have to resign,

766
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:32,041
Because I could never
belong to something

767
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,277
That turns its back
on the truth.

768
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:36,112
Suddenly my chosen
profession seems

769
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:39,249
So terribly unimportant.

770
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:40,817
No.

771
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,786
The world needs
the Time Masters

772
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,556
And the Time Masters,
most assuredly,

773
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:48,558
Need Rip Hunter.

774
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,028
My only wish is that one day,

775
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,431
When you're off traveling
space and time,

776
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,200
You'll realize what I have,
and understand

777
00:38:57,202 --> 00:39:00,837
Why I'm doing what I'm doing.

778
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,840
I hope you think of me
when that day comes.

779
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:07,210
I will...

780
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:10,947
Because I'll be with you.

781
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:20,623
Hey.

782
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,659
I was just looking for you.

783
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:24,027
How are you feeling?

784
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,695
Good. Yeah.

785
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,531
Turns out I bounce back
pretty quickly from hypothermia.

786
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,867
In fact, I managed to remember
some of the things

787
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:35,104
You said to me
when I was almost dead.

788
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,607
You were wrong, b-t-w.

789
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:39,809
You don't need me.
You don't need anybody.

790
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:41,477
I mean,
you're pretty amazing

791
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,213
And I'm lucky
to be your friend,

792
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,916
Be on this mission
together with...

793
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:57,293
That's... surprising.

794
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,100
Okay.

795
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:05,568
I'll say it.

796
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,304
Why don't we just
drop him off back in 2016?

797
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:12,075
Because my sister
lives in 2016.

798
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,978
And your sister,
and your wife.

799
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,046
So what exactly
are we talking about here?

800
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:19,349
Leaving Rory in the brig
until we take down Savage?

801
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:21,784
No, no, no, no,
the brig is unsuitable

802
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,419
For long-term incarceration.

803
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,922
Leaving him free run
of the ship is not an option.

804
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,156
I'll handle it.

805
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:29,158
By handling it,
you mean murder?

806
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,496
I said I'll handle it.

807
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:56,953
I told you that'll be
the last time you hit me.

808
00:40:56,955 --> 00:41:00,056
You were right.

809
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:02,125
That the plan?

810
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:04,927
Take me out
in the middle of nowhere,

811
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:08,064
Where no one can find the body?

812
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:12,301
I wish there were
some other way, Mick,

813
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,971
But you're dangerous.

814
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:18,173
- A liability to the team.
- Team?

815
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:21,978
You and I were a team!

816
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,682
What happened to you?

817
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:27,917
People change.

818
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:30,453
You think you're
some kind of hero,

819
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:32,855
But deep down
you're still the same

820
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:36,025
Punk kid I saved in juvie.

821
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:39,028
You haven't got the guts.

822
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,497
You want to kill me?

823
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,200
Kill me.

824
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:48,371
Only one of us is walking
out of here alive.

825
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,078
You're right.
