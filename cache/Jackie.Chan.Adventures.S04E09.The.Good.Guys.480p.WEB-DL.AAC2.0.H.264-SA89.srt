1
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:09,274
Finn: What makes
the Burmese raccoon
such a cool pet?

2
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:12,344
Well, unlike
ordinary raccoons,

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,480
it won't raid
your trash can.

4
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:17,683
Ooh-ooh, you don't have
to walk it or feed it.

5
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,752
And it's made
of solid gold!

6
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:21,920
Score!

7
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:25,024
And we bagged it without
any trouble from...

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,763
That guy.

9
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,366
Easy does it, Jackie!

10
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,968
Whoa-ohh! Eh!

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,169
Jade!

12
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:40,172
Why do you have to
show up every time?

13
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:42,107
'Cause you'd miss me
if I didn't.

14
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,976
Uhh!

15
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:47,112
Why does chan
have to show up
every time?

16
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:49,982
Hunh!

17
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,986
Oh, give us
a break, chan.

18
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:56,989
We're not even working
for any forces of
darkness this week.

19
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:58,991
Yeah, we're on vacation.

20
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:02,795
Can't you let us have
just one little
priceless statue?

21
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:05,798
The Burmese raccoon
belongs in a museum.

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,332
Well, ratso
and chow here

23
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,401
are gonna put <i> you</i>
àwhere <i> you</i> belong--

24
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,370
in a hospital.

25
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:12,938
Hyah! Unh!

26
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,206
Ohh! Ooh!

27
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,507
Ow!

28
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,010
Hunh!
Oof!

29
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:20,145
Hey, Finn,
I'll hold that for you.

30
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:21,346
Oh, thanks.

31
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:23,082
Hey! Give it!

32
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,086
Jade?

33
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,059
Just one question,
kiddo.

34
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,695
Where you gonna go?

35
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,065
Heh heh.

36
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,900
Anywhere but down?

37
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,487
Give up the raccoon.

38
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,394
Hyah! Aiee-ya!

39
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:43,662
Unh! Uhh!

40
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,763
Hyah! Hyah!

41
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:45,898
Hunh!

42
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,368
Chow: Unh!

43
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,174
Whoa-oh-ohh!

44
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,013
Ow!

45
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:05,951
Thanks.

46
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:11,957
Grab on tight!

47
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:18,163
Are we just gonna let chan
get away with our nest egg?

48
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,501
Grab on tight!

49
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:38,650
This is gonna leave a mark--
or 3.

50
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,053
Aaaah!
Ohh!

51
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,454
All: Oof!

52
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,756
Ohh!
Aaah!
Aah!

53
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:45,924
All: Unh!

54
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,460
So much
for our wealth.

55
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,395
At least we have
our health.

56
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,932
Finn: Shut up,
ratso-o-o-o-o!

57
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:58,937
(Finn, ratso, & chow
crying out in pain)

58
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,007
The raccoon is in the museum
where it belongs,

59
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:06,545
and I do not think
we will be hearing
from Finn, ratso, and chow

60
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,347
any time soon.

61
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,615
Finn: Chan!

62
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,220
Tch! don't you three
know when to quit?

63
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,957
All: We quit!

64
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,592
All: Huh?

65
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,295
We're tired of
never making money.

66
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:25,097
We're tired
of being enslaved

67
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:28,700
by dragons, wizards,
and floating demon heads.

68
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:32,704
Most of all,
we're tired of getting
our butts kicked by you.

69
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,107
Yeah. It hurts.

70
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,811
All: We want to be
good guys!

71
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,848
A trick! They want
to rob uncle's shop!

72
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,449
No! We're telling
the truth.

73
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,618
We weren't always
bad guys.

74
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,786
Let me guess.

75
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,122
You sang in disco bands
at weddings.

76
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,223
How'd you know?

77
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:54,226
I was employee of the month
at sunglass shack,

78
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:55,727
3 times.

79
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,063
I studied theoretical physics.

80
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:01,933
Chow: We only went bad
because we fell in
with the wrong crowd.

81
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,870
Yeah, each other.
Ooh!

82
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:07,139
Oh, come on, chan,
please?

83
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,975
You gave big t
a chance.

84
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,977
Well, uh, yes...

85
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,012
They have a point.

86
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,215
(All moaning)

87
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:20,152
If you are truly serious
about being good,

88
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:22,788
you should go make your point
to captain black.

89
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,289
I wish you luck.

90
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,829
Huh?

91
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,030
Aiee-yah!

92
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,769
Call police!

93
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,472
Thank you for shopping
at uncle's rare finds.

94
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,140
Have a groovy day.

95
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,677
Bye-bye.

96
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,379
Come back soon.

97
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:54,686
(Gasps)
Dark magic reversed
cosmic yin and Yang

98
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,289
while we were
getting lo mein.

99
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,690
Uh-duh-uh-uh,

100
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,225
everything is fine,
<i>sensei.</i>

101
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,295
Yeah, Finn, ratso, and chow
spoke to captain black,

102
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:04,796
just like you said, Jackie.

103
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,300
Captain black said
that since I was able

104
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:10,502
to become such
a model citizen,

105
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,304
there was hope
for my old cohorts.

106
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,972
He put them
on probation.

107
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,475
(Gasps) In my shop?

108
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:17,709
That's what I said, unc,

109
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:18,877
but check it out.

110
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,712
These radio-controlled
ankle cuffs

111
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,582
lets section 13 know
where they are at all times.

112
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,951
And if they try
and run for it...

113
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,793
See?
Instant chain gang.

114
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,538
Ahh!

115
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,941
These brownies are so good.

116
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,543
What's your secret?

117
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:52,744
Mm-mm-mm.

118
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,746
You can not have
the recipe

119
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,748
until you prove
yourself, ratso.

120
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,918
And you can start
by doing the dishes.

121
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,620
You got it, t.

122
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,792
Excuse me?

123
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:10,028
Ooh! Yes, <i> sensei.</i>

124
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,235
(Video game fanfare)

125
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,171
High score!

126
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:20,839
Unh! Uhh!

127
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,975
I am not worthy.

128
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,977
Do not steal that!

129
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,515
(Exhales)

130
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,952
Whaaaaaaw!

131
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,388
Uhh, please, Finn,

132
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,924
I am on the phone.

133
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:40,792
Oop! Sorry, chan-meister.

134
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,761
Hey, but how's my form?

135
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:45,397
I'm sorry. Yes.
I will leave...

136
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,798
As soon as I can.

137
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,333
What's the scoop, j.C.?

138
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:49,601
Big mission?

139
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:52,337
No mission.
My real job.

140
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,939
The museum is
sending me to Bhutan

141
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,407
to collect an artifact.

142
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,209
Jackie,
you can not go

143
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,744
while criminals
live in my shop!

144
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,813
Excuse me.

145
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,215
Ex-criminals.

146
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:04,683
don't sweat it, unc.

147
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,618
Tohru can put the smack-down
on his old pals

148
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,953
if they try anything.

149
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:10,822
And if they really
get out of line...

150
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,023
Zappo!

151
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,098
Ohh!
Yipe!
Oof!

152
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,168
Oops! Sorry.

153
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,402
We'll hold the fort, chan.

154
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:25,637
don't worry about us.

155
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,205
Yeah. Remember,

156
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,908
we're good guys
now.

157
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,079
(Cell phone rings)

158
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,247
Hello?

159
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:36,848
Jackie, bad news.

160
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,850
The transmitters
from the ankle cuffs

161
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,852
show our
favorite parolees
in the far east,

162
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,254
heading your way.

163
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:45,056
I knew they couldn't
stay good for long.

164
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:48,260
But I never told them
that the artifact
I came here to collect

165
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,529
was a priceless gemstone.

166
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,736
I am Jackie chan
from the museum.

167
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:58,937
With your permission,

168
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:02,774
I will bring the opal
back to San Francisco.

169
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,183
Bad day.

170
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:20,792
So, the whole
"good guys" thing
was an act.

171
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,328
Unh!
Nice move, Finn.

172
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,630
I see you have
been practicing.

173
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,805
Unh! Ratso?

174
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,607
You have all
been practicing.

175
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:36,841
Unh!

176
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,320
Chow?

177
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,458
Unh! Ohh!

178
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,994
Ok, who are
you guys?

179
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:59,130
Jade: Just 3 clowns
who are about to get
smacked down...

180
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,267
By Jade's angels.

181
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,303
Fi--rat--ch--
Jade?

182
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:08,340
Freeze! Back away
from our bosley.

183
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,277
Uh, I mean, buddy.

184
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,511
Hunh!
Hyah!
Yee-aah!

185
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,316
Unh!

186
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,822
Aah! Uh-aah!
Uhh!

187
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,924
What are you
doing here?

188
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,959
And why did you
bring them?

189
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,561
All part of their
good-guy training.

190
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,563
They can sit around
at home being good,

191
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:33,531
or they can go out
and do good.

192
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,337
Or get smacked down
real good.

193
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:42,340
Ok, so their technique
needs work,

194
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,442
but I give 'em
a solid "b" for effort.

195
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,645
Uhh! Run for it!

196
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,712
All: Unh!

197
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,416
Aah!
Yah!
Aah!

198
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,395
(All groaning)

199
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,864
Let's finish 'em off.

200
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,332
Now, Jade...

201
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,335
You know your uncle Jackie
would not approve.

202
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,270
Ohh!

203
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,472
Jade's been a good
influence on us,

204
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,408
and, uh, vice-versa.

205
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,078
Quickly, we must
get this to safety.

206
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,713
Heh heh! I'm sorry.

207
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,549
I will have the museum
send you a check
for the broken building.

208
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:25,817
Thank you!

209
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,820
I'm telling you,
Jackie,

210
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,555
they're totally
reformed.

211
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:33,158
I haven't thought about
chain-ganging 'em once.

212
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,760
Hmm, they did help out
back there...

213
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,362
In their own way.

214
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,432
And at least they're not
bothering uncle anymore.

215
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:43,034
Uncle: Tohru...

216
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,936
Do dishes!

217
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:48,506
Can ratso not do them
when he returns?

218
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,309
I guess I owe you all
an apology.

219
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,178
I thought those thieves
were you,

220
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,446
here for the opal.

221
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,214
No harm, no foul,
chan-meister.

222
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,583
Besides,
opal shmopal.

223
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,953
Yeah, when we
used to be bad guys,

224
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,189
we only went after...

225
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,760
Big stuff.

226
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:11,229
Did you see the size
of that shmopal?

227
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,632
If it was ours,
we'd be set for life.

228
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,202
But we're
good guys now.

229
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,570
Right?

230
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:26,177
Ok, but we have to start
being good guys again

231
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:29,080
after we steal the opal.

232
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,650
Sorry.

233
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,055
Unh! Uhh!

234
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,657
You guys
are so grounded!

235
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,194
All right, I guess
that's everything.

236
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,396
So, uh, thanks.

237
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,398
Heh, it may not
seem like it...

238
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
But you did
teach us one thing.

239
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,870
Oh, and what was that?

240
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:55,473
We're just not very good
at being good guys.

241
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,409
I told you they
couldn't be trusted.

242
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,078
Heh heh.

243
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,883
Wow! It all worked out
for once.

244
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:08,353
All we had to do was
be true to ourselves.

245
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:09,754
Ahh!

246
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:12,824
All part of the journey
of life, my men.

247
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:13,892
Huh?

248
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,028
Yo, toss over the rock,

249
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,230
and maybe I won't toss
your sorry selves

250
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,632
down the mountain.

251
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:28,239
Ha ha ha! No way are we
handing our life savings

252
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:31,409
to someone who looks
like a pizza boy!

253
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,578
Yo, yo, yo.
This is one pizza boy

254
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,447
who's gonna serve you up
an extra-large whoopin'

255
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,649
with 2 kinds of cheese.

256
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,551
Waa-hah!

257
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,355
Ohh!
Unh!

258
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,859
Hoo-hyah!

259
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,260
(All groaning)

260
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,429
Huh?

261
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:55,800
Yo, strikemaster ice
is in the hizzouse!

262
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:58,303
How'd you learn
to fight so good?

263
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,705
I was just
a pizza delivery guy...

264
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,707
Huh? I knew it!

265
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,077
And it all
went down one night.

266
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,413
I delivered a medium
ham-and-pineapple

267
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,415
to this weird old man.

268
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:13,651
And the fool stiffed me
on the tip,

269
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:16,888
but he told me this wild
legend about the zu monastery

270
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,924
floating above the clouds
here in the far east.

271
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,693
The monks started teaching me
their extreme,

272
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,895
top secret style
of martial arts.

273
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,097
It was off the hook!

274
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,498
But then I got hip

275
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,235
to what the monks
really wanted with me.

276
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:32,704
They wanted to teach me
the ways of peace.

277
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,105
Well, I needed that bunk

278
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,641
like a pizza needs
a soggy crust, yo.

279
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,112
They expelled me and dj fist
and mc cobra

280
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,647
for bad behavior.

281
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,316
Now, we would've kicked
their bald booties,

282
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:48,753
but we just weren't good
enough to beat 'em yet.

283
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:55,326
Uh, well, you sure
kick Booty now, ice baby.

284
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,729
Yeah, go whoop
those monks.

285
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:01,332
You don't wanna scratch
that beautiful opal

286
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,402
while you're exacting
your revenge, do ya?

287
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,938
Yeah, so why don't you
just leave it here?

288
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,806
We'll watch it for you.

289
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,575
Yeah, for reals.

290
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,354
Let me demonstrate
how this little hunk of ice

291
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,356
is gonna let
strikemaster ice

292
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:28,893
go back to the monastery
and bring down the house!

293
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,234
Finn: No, no, no!
don't--don't do it!

294
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,402
Save it for the monks!

295
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:38,703
Mommy!

296
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,442
(Explosion)
All: Aaaah!

297
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,813
I was going to ask you
to be my henchmen,

298
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,949
but if you work
for strikemaster ice,

299
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,685
you gots to have
thicker crust.

300
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,689
Ohh!
(Sobbing)

301
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:58,957
Easy does it.

302
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,825
The signal from
the ankle transceivers

303
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:03,428
suggests our
former reformers

304
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,029
haven't moved
in an hour.

305
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,165
It could be
an ambush.

306
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,701
Hiya!

307
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:11,035
If you let us down...

308
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,938
We'll help you find
the shmopal.

309
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,611
You know, I don't see
how we can help out

310
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,915
if we're all chained up
like this, partners.

311
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,850
You are not
our partners.

312
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,952
You are our prisoners.

313
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,661
Wow! Just like
the pimply kid said.

314
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,999
"Floatin' above the clouds,
yo, yo, yo."

315
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,938
Oh, uh, wait up!

316
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,072
(Explosion)

317
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,074
Yeah, see how you like
preachin' peace

318
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,010
with your temple in pieces.

319
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,547
Lock 'em up, boys.

320
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,119
Whoa! Strikemaster ice
is a twerp.

321
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,854
I can take him.

322
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,155
Jade.

323
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,924
Unh!

324
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,893
Say, chan never said

325
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:11,863
you couldn't get
the drop on the other 2.

326
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,965
Yeah!

327
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,668
Good one, Finn.

328
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,070
Run for it!

329
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,772
Unh!
Uhh!
Hunh!

330
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:23,508
You have done
enough damage...

331
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,109
Wouldn't you say?

332
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:27,178
So you wanna throw down?

333
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,748
The greatest victory
is the battle
not fought.

334
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,350
I'll reflect
on the meaning of that

335
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,751
while I wail on you.

336
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,159
Jade: Hey!

337
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,596
Who cut your hair,
the gardener?

338
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,418
(Razzberry)

339
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,956
Unh!
Uhh!

340
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,091
Warning:

341
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,426
Objects in mist are closer
than they appear.

342
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,565
You know,
your crane stance
could use some work.

343
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,503
No!
No!
Aah!

344
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,108
Sweet.

345
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,777
Let's make like
a nose and run.

346
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,251
Strikemaster ice: That's it,
you're history!

347
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:43,955
Wait.

348
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,324
We can't let chan
go out like this.

349
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:50,261
Yeah. After all the times
we tried to knock him off...

350
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,130
Letting someone else
do the job

351
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,731
just doesn't seem right.

352
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,767
Let's rescue
the chan-man.

353
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,205
Uh, never mind.

354
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,080
Let go, yo!

355
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:15,953
You want it?

356
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,323
It is yours.

357
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,592
Unh!

358
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,429
Hey, thanks,
partner!

359
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,905
Guys, you don't want
to go that way!

360
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:35,840
Nice try, kiddo!

361
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:38,643
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!

362
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,184
Are they...?

363
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,518
I think so.

364
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:53,024
I think I may
actually miss them.

365
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,392
I know what you mean.

366
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:55,826
Weird, huh?

367
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,064
Poor guys.

368
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,405
(Sighs) You know,

369
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:11,008
we're not very good
at being bad guys, either.

370
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,755
Hey Jackie, do you believe in
giving people second chances?

371
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:25,957
Yes, yes.

372
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,359
I always give people
a second chance.

373
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:31,929
Like my stunt men,
some of my assistants...

374
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,564
They do something wrong,

375
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,832
I give them another chance.

376
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,400
They do something
wrong again,

377
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,537
I give them third chance,
not just a second chance.

378
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,973
I always give them
second chance.

379
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:43,641
More than second.
