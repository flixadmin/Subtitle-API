1
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,005
This is the Asgardian
refugee vessel Statesman.

2
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:33,986
We are under assault.

3
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:36,131
I repeat, we are under assault.

4
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:39,381
The engines are dead, life support failing.

5
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:43,217
Requesting aid
from any vessel within range.

6
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:46,514
We are 22 jump points out of Asgard.

7
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:51,506
Our crew is made up of Asgardian families.
We have very few soldiers here.

8
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:53,318
This is not a warcraft.

9
00:00:53,343 --> 00:00:55,451
I repeat, this is not a warcraft.

10
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,947
Hear me and rejoice.

11
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:20,789
You have had the privilege
of being saved by the Great Titan.

12
00:01:23,743 --> 00:01:25,911
You may think this is suffering.

13
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,279
No.

14
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:31,483
It is salvation.

15
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:40,722
Universal scales tip toward balance
because of your sacrifice.

16
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,847
Smile.

17
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:49,823
For even in death,
you have become Children of Thanos.

18
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:07,446
I know what it's like to lose.

19
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:12,446
To feel so desperately that you're right...

20
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:15,751
...yet to fail, nonetheless.

21
00:02:23,973 --> 00:02:25,674
It's frightening.

22
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:28,919
Turns the legs to jelly.

23
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:33,347
But I ask you, to what end?

24
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:37,399
Dread it, run from it,

25
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:40,587
destiny arrives all the same.

26
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:43,802
And now, it's here.

27
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,408
Or should I say...

28
00:02:47,574 --> 00:02:49,209
I am.

29
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:55,950
You talk too much.

30
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:58,766
The Tesseract.

31
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,227
Or your brother's head.

32
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:08,278
I assume you have a preference.

33
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,779
Oh, I do.

34
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:14,344
Kill away.

35
00:03:29,506 --> 00:03:30,684
All right, stop!

36
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:38,092
We don't have the Tesseract.
It was destroyed on Asgard.

37
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:51,839
You really are the worst brother.

38
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,514
I assure you, brother,

39
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,787
the sun will shine on us again.

40
00:04:02,804 --> 00:04:05,912
Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.

41
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:09,990
Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian.

42
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,506
And for another...

43
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,990
...we have a Hulk.

44
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:29,044
Let him have his fun.

45
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:22,862
Allfathers,

46
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,903
let the dark magic flow
through me one last...

47
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:29,902
...time.

48
00:05:44,703 --> 00:05:46,104
That was a mistake.

49
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,535
No!

50
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:05,605
You're going to die for that.

51
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,801
Shh.

52
00:06:16,698 --> 00:06:22,188
My humble personage...
bows before your grandeur.

53
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:31,130
No other being has ever had the might,
nay, the nobility

54
00:06:31,155 --> 00:06:35,913
to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones.

55
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:43,842
The universe lies within your grasp.

56
00:07:22,986 --> 00:07:25,788
There are two more stones on Earth.

57
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:31,032
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.

58
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:32,722
Father, we will not fail you.

59
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:35,013
If I might interject.

60
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,966
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.

61
00:07:39,432 --> 00:07:42,161
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.

62
00:07:42,186 --> 00:07:44,686
If you consider failure experience.

63
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:47,314
I consider experience experience.

64
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:50,350
Almighty Thanos,

65
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:55,113
I, Loki, prince of Asgard,

66
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,008
Odinson,

67
00:08:03,977 --> 00:08:05,913
the rightful king of Jotunheim,

68
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:08,393
god of mischief,

69
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:11,375
do hereby pledge to you...

70
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,134
my undying fidelity.

71
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:28,180
Undying?

72
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,903
You should choose your words
more carefully.

73
00:08:56,072 --> 00:08:57,073
You...

74
00:08:58,247 --> 00:08:59,915
...will never be...

75
00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:03,669
...a god.

76
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,012
No!

77
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,299
No resurrections this time.

78
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:58,245
No. Loki.

79
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,104
Seriously, you don't have any money?

80
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:43,297
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

81
00:10:43,322 --> 00:10:44,888
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

82
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:46,948
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.

83
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,877
Oh. Wait, wait, wait. I think I have 200.

84
00:10:48,902 --> 00:10:49,999
Dollars?

85
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,658
- Rupees.
- Which is?

86
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,465
Uh, buck and a half.

87
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,119
What do you want?

88
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,494
I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.

89
00:11:10,074 --> 00:11:11,781
Thanos is coming.

90
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,720
He's coming.

91
00:11:17,835 --> 00:11:19,069
Who?

92
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,387
Slow down, slow down.
I'll spell it out for you.

93
00:11:29,393 --> 00:11:30,559
You're totally rambling.

94
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:31,493
- No, I'm not.
- You lost me.

95
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:34,161
Look, you know how you're having a dream,
and in the dream you gotta pee.

96
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:35,297
- Yeah.
- Okay.

97
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:37,666
And then you're like, "Oh, my God.
There's no bathrooms. What am I gonna do?

98
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:38,933
- "Oh, someone's watching."
- Right.

99
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:40,001
"Oh, I'm gonna go in my pants."

100
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:42,086
And then you wake up and in real life
you actually have to pee.

101
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:43,305
- Yes.
- Yeah.

102
00:11:43,307 --> 00:11:44,539
- Okay.
- Everybody has that.

103
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,575
Right, that's the point I'm trying to make.

104
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:50,581
Apropos of that,
last night I dreamt we had a kid.

105
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:52,588
It was so real.

106
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,361
We named him after your eccentric uncle.
Uh, what was his name?

107
00:11:55,385 --> 00:11:57,696
- Right.
- Morgan! Morgan.

108
00:11:57,721 --> 00:11:59,554
- So you woke up...
- Naturally.

109
00:11:59,556 --> 00:12:01,355
...and thought that we were...

110
00:12:01,357 --> 00:12:02,524
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

111
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:03,368
- Yes?
- No.

112
00:12:03,393 --> 00:12:05,226
I had a dream about it. It was so real.

113
00:12:05,228 --> 00:12:08,687
If you wanted to have a kid...
you wouldn't have done that.

114
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,231
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.

115
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:13,001
It's just a housing unit for nanoparticles.

116
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:14,402
You're not helping your case, okay?

117
00:12:14,404 --> 00:12:15,637
No, this is detachable. It's not a...

118
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,257
You don't need that.

119
00:12:17,282 --> 00:12:20,008
I know, I had the surgery.
I'm just trying to protect us

120
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,377
and future usses and that's it. Just
in case there's a monster in the closet.

121
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:25,337
- Instead of, you know...
- Shirts.

122
00:12:26,948 --> 00:12:28,914
- You know me so well.
- God.

123
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:30,898
You finish all my sentences.

124
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:33,589
You should have shirts in your closet.

125
00:12:33,902 --> 00:12:35,218
Yeah.

126
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,635
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.

127
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,160
We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight.

128
00:12:39,162 --> 00:12:41,187
Show off this Harry Winston.

129
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,674
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.

130
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:45,065
I should promise you.

131
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,281
- Yes.
- I will.

132
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:49,770
Thank you.

133
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:50,971
Tony Stark.

134
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:54,243
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.

135
00:12:56,187 --> 00:12:58,945
Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding,
by the way.

136
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,937
I'm sorry, you giving out tickets
to something?

137
00:13:00,962 --> 00:13:02,570
We need your help.

138
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:06,453
It's not overselling it to say that
the fate of the universe is at stake.

139
00:13:06,478 --> 00:13:08,013
And who's "we"?

140
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:10,937
Hey, Tony.

141
00:13:10,962 --> 00:13:12,093
Bruce.

142
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:13,867
- Pepper.
- Hi.

143
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,351
- Oh.
- You okay?

144
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:24,373
At the dawn of the universe,
there was nothing. Then...

145
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:25,906
Boom.

146
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:32,851
The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals
hurtling across the virgin universe.

147
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:38,485
These Infinity Stones each control
an essential aspect of existence.

148
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,590
Space.

149
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:43,025
Reality.

150
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:45,661
Power.

151
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:48,163
Soul.

152
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:50,399
Mind.

153
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:53,519
And Time.

154
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:04,478
Tell me his name again.

155
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,544
Thanos.

156
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:07,257
He's a plague, Tony.

157
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:11,427
He invades planets. He takes what he wants.
He wipes out half the population.

158
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:13,192
He sent Loki.

159
00:14:13,823 --> 00:14:16,591
The attack on New York, that's him.

160
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,472
This is it.

161
00:14:19,662 --> 00:14:20,628
What's our timeline?

162
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,229
No telling.
He has the Power and Space Stones.

163
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,866
That already makes him the
strongest creature in the whole universe.

164
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:29,169
If he gets his hands on all six stones,
Tony...

165
00:14:29,194 --> 00:14:32,706
He could destroy life
on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

166
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:34,708
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

167
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,877
Are you seriously leaning on
the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

168
00:14:36,902 --> 00:14:38,380
Is that what it is?

169
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:43,124
I'm going to allow that.

170
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,454
If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just
stick this one down a garbage disposal?

171
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:49,689
No can do.

172
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:52,492
We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone
with our lives.

173
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:56,396
And I swore off dairy, but then
Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me.

174
00:14:56,398 --> 00:14:57,898
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- Not bad.

175
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,263
A bit chalky.

176
00:14:59,288 --> 00:15:01,262
A Hunk of Hulk of Burning Fudge
is our favorite.

177
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:02,435
- That's a thing?
- Whatever.

178
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,605
Point is, things change.

179
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,673
Our oath to protect the Time Stone
cannot change.

180
00:15:06,675 --> 00:15:08,841
And this stone may be the best chance
we have against Thanos.

181
00:15:08,843 --> 00:15:11,878
Yeah, so conversely,
it may also be his best chance against us.

182
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,513
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

183
00:15:13,515 --> 00:15:16,284
What is your job exactly?
Besides making balloon animals.

184
00:15:17,362 --> 00:15:19,872
Protecting your reality, douchebag.

185
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,673
Okay, guys.
Could we table this discussion right now?

186
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:26,385
The fact is we have this stone.
We know where it is.

187
00:15:26,394 --> 00:15:28,795
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone

188
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,588
and we have to find him now.

189
00:15:31,255 --> 00:15:32,799
Yeah, that's the thing.

190
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:33,871
What do you mean?

191
00:15:33,896 --> 00:15:37,503
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off
his transponder. He's offline.

192
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:38,838
- What?
- Yeah.

193
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,907
Tony, you lost another super-bot?

194
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:43,443
I didn't lose him. He's more than that.
He's evolving.

195
00:15:43,445 --> 00:15:44,813
Who could find Vision then?

196
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:49,005
Shit.

197
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:50,660
Probably Steve Rogers.

198
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:51,820
Oh, great.

199
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:53,500
Maybe.

200
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:55,028
But...

201
00:15:58,533 --> 00:15:59,634
Call him.

202
00:16:00,223 --> 00:16:01,966
It's not that easy.

203
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:04,774
God, we haven't caught up in a spell,
have we?

204
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,716
No.

205
00:16:05,741 --> 00:16:07,638
The Avengers broke up. We're toast.

206
00:16:08,224 --> 00:16:09,521
Broke up?

207
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:13,315
Like a band? Like... Like the Beatles?

208
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,232
Cap and I fell out hard.

209
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,591
We're not on speaking terms.

210
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,382
Tony, listen to me.

211
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:23,718
Thor's gone.

212
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:28,389
Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

213
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:46,607
Flip phone.

214
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:10,264
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be
moving your hair, would ya?

215
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:13,388
Not at the moment, no.

216
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:47,474
You okay?

217
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:50,068
- Help him!
- Banner!

218
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,870
- Wong! Look alive!
- Go, go! We got it!

219
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:54,573
- Friday, what am I looking at?
- Not sure. I'm working on it.

220
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:57,976
Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone
in your back pocket, Doc!

221
00:17:57,978 --> 00:17:59,346
Might wanna use it.

222
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:29,074
Ned, hey.
I need you to cause a distraction.

223
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:30,466
Holy shit.

224
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:32,487
We're all gonna die!

225
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:33,812
There's a spaceship!

226
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:35,380
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!

227
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:46,994
What's the matter with you kids?
You never seen a spaceship before?

228
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,851
Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd Street.
Notify first responders.

229
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:04,012
Will do.

230
00:19:32,348 --> 00:19:35,284
Hear me and rejoice.

231
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:40,450
You are about to die
at the hands of the Children of Thanos.

232
00:19:41,364 --> 00:19:45,983
Be thankful that your meaningless lives
are now contributing-

233
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,896
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.

234
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,822
You better pack it up and get outta here.

235
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,185
Stonekeeper.

236
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:56,255
Does this chattering animal speak for you?

237
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,278
Certainly not. I speak for myself.

238
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,967
You're trespassing in this city
and on this planet.

239
00:20:01,945 --> 00:20:03,644
He means get lost, Squidward.

240
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,825
He exhausts me.

241
00:20:05,607 --> 00:20:06,971
Bring me the stone.

242
00:20:08,513 --> 00:20:09,881
Banner, you want a piece?

243
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:13,900
Mmm, no, not really.
But when do I ever get what I want?

244
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,091
That's right.

245
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:16,981
Okay. Push!

246
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:20,194
It's been a while.
It's gonna be good to have you, buddy.

247
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,384
Okay. Shh.

248
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,221
Let me just...
I need to concentrate here for a second.

249
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,723
Come on, come on, man.

250
00:20:27,224 --> 00:20:28,177
God!

251
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,454
Where's your guy?

252
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:33,197
I don't know.
We've sorta been having a thing.

253
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,565
- It's no time for a thing.
- I know.

254
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,087
That's the thing right there. Let's go.

255
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,370
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

256
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,576
Tony, I'm sorry.
Either I can't or he won't.

257
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,543
It's okay.

258
00:20:47,545 --> 00:20:48,564
Hey, stand down.

259
00:20:48,588 --> 00:20:50,080
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

260
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,549
- I have him.
- Damn it.

261
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,576
Where'd that come from?

262
00:21:20,578 --> 00:21:23,046
It's nanotech.
You like it? A little something I-

263
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:30,021
Doctor Banner, if the rest of
your green friend won't be joining us...

264
00:21:39,575 --> 00:21:41,031
Gotta get that stone outta here, now.

265
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,532
It stays with me.

266
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:43,535
Exactly. Bye.

267
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:54,644
Tony, you okay?

268
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,679
- How we doing? Good? Bad?
- Really, really good.

269
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:57,914
Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?

270
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,150
I'm trying. He won't come out.

271
00:22:01,052 --> 00:22:02,120
Hammer.

272
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,962
Come on, Hulk! What are you doing to me?

273
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,198
Come out! Come out! Come out!

274
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,309
No!

275
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:23,108
What do you mean, "no"?

276
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:30,747
Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?

277
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,017
Kid, where'd you come from?

278
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,585
A field trip to MoMA.

279
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,395
Uh, what is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?

280
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:41,224
Uh, he's from space. He came here
to steal a necklace from a wizard.

281
00:23:07,863 --> 00:23:11,622
Your powers are quaint.
You must be popular with children.

282
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,359
It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.

283
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,536
Then I'll take it off your corpse.

284
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:36,778
You'll find removing
a dead man's spell troublesome.

285
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,481
You'll only wish you were dead.

286
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:49,864
No!

287
00:23:53,864 --> 00:23:55,398
Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.

288
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,661
On it!

289
00:24:04,505 --> 00:24:05,684
Not cool.

290
00:24:10,255 --> 00:24:11,081
Gotcha!

291
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:13,341
Wait!

292
00:24:21,052 --> 00:24:24,069
Uh, Mr. Stark, I'm being beamed up.

293
00:24:24,094 --> 00:24:25,329
Hang on, kid.

294
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:42,409
Oh!

295
00:24:44,214 --> 00:24:45,257
Ugh.

296
00:24:45,282 --> 00:24:47,084
Wong, you're invited to my wedding.

297
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:55,925
Give me a little juice, Friday.

298
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,113
Unlock 17:A.

299
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:20,949
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

300
00:25:20,951 --> 00:25:22,891
But you said save the wizard!

301
00:25:23,477 --> 00:25:24,419
I can't breathe.

302
00:25:25,422 --> 00:25:27,291
We're too high up.
You're running out of air.

303
00:25:28,258 --> 00:25:30,460
Yeah. That makes sense.

304
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,944
Mr. Stark,
it smells like a new car in here!

305
00:25:49,946 --> 00:25:50,945
Happy trails, kid.

306
00:25:50,947 --> 00:25:52,468
- Friday, send him home.
- Yep.

307
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,742
Oh, come on!

308
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:05,002
Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.

309
00:26:05,027 --> 00:26:07,495
Tony? Oh, my God.
Are you all right? What's going on?

310
00:26:07,497 --> 00:26:10,398
Yeah, I'm fine. I just think
we might have to push our 8:30 res.

311
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,533
Why?

312
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:14,727
Just 'cause I'll probably
not make it back for a while.

313
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:17,178
Tell me you're not on that ship.

314
00:26:17,203 --> 00:26:18,086
Yeah.

315
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,538
God, no, please tell me
you're not on the ship.

316
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:22,235
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.

317
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,813
Come back here, Tony. I swear to God.

318
00:26:23,838 --> 00:26:26,005
- Pep.
- Come back here right now.

319
00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:27,281
Come back.

320
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:29,445
Boss, we're losing her.

321
00:26:30,052 --> 00:26:31,360
I'm going too.

322
00:26:40,564 --> 00:26:41,964
Oh, my God!

323
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,287
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

324
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:04,105
Where you going?

325
00:27:04,297 --> 00:27:07,890
The Time Stone's been taken.
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

326
00:27:08,257 --> 00:27:09,825
What will you do?

327
00:27:10,538 --> 00:27:12,273
I'm gonna make a call.

328
00:27:52,568 --> 00:27:53,902
Sing it, Drax!

329
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,992
Why are we doing this again?

330
00:28:08,017 --> 00:28:10,816
It's a distress signal, Rocket.
Someone could be dying.

331
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:13,041
I get that, but why are we doing it?

332
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,730
'Cause we're nice.

333
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:18,001
And maybe whoever it is will give us
a little cheddar cheese for our effort.

334
00:28:18,027 --> 00:28:20,427
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point.

335
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:22,329
I mean, if he doesn't pony up...

336
00:28:22,331 --> 00:28:24,120
- We take his ship.
- Exactly!

337
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:26,302
- Bingo!
- All right!

338
00:28:29,515 --> 00:28:31,214
We are arriving.

339
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:33,940
All right, Guardians,
don't forget this might be dangerous,

340
00:28:33,942 --> 00:28:36,177
so let's put on our mean faces.

341
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:44,113
Groot, put that thing away, now.
I don't wanna tell you again.

342
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,355
Groot.

343
00:28:45,387 --> 00:28:46,553
I am Groot!

344
00:28:46,555 --> 00:28:47,654
- Whoa!
- Language!

345
00:28:47,656 --> 00:28:49,066
- Hey!
- Wow.

346
00:28:49,234 --> 00:28:51,101
You got some acorns on you, kid.

347
00:28:51,126 --> 00:28:54,144
Ever since you got a little sap,
you're a total d-hole.

348
00:28:54,604 --> 00:28:57,917
Now, keep it up,
and I'm gonna smash that thing to pieces.

349
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,374
What happened?

350
00:29:10,412 --> 00:29:11,680
Oh, my God.

351
00:29:17,352 --> 00:29:19,154
Looks like we're not getting paid.

352
00:29:21,418 --> 00:29:23,433
Wipers! Wipers!

353
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,692
Get it off.

354
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:34,167
How the hell is this dude still alive?

355
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,066
He is not a dude.

356
00:29:36,265 --> 00:29:37,909
You're a dude.

357
00:29:38,051 --> 00:29:41,003
This... This is a man.

358
00:29:41,553 --> 00:29:44,487
A handsome, muscular man.

359
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:45,578
I'm muscular.

360
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,214
But who are you kidding, Quill?
You're one sandwich away from fat.

361
00:29:48,216 --> 00:29:49,167
Yeah, right.

362
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,978
It's true, Quill. You have put on weight.

363
00:29:51,003 --> 00:29:52,027
What?

364
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,978
Gamora, do you think I'm...

365
00:29:58,198 --> 00:30:01,878
He is anxious, angry.

366
00:30:02,073 --> 00:30:05,136
He feels tremendous loss and guilt.

367
00:30:05,677 --> 00:30:08,545
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.

368
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:11,128
Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me.

369
00:30:11,153 --> 00:30:14,612
Okay. I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.

370
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,732
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

371
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:17,343
You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?

372
00:30:17,345 --> 00:30:20,646
It's like his muscles
are made of Cotati metal fibers.

373
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:22,505
Stop massaging his muscles.

374
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:25,424
Wake him up.

375
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:29,372
Wake.

376
00:30:46,808 --> 00:30:48,768
Who the hell are you guys?

377
00:30:51,846 --> 00:30:55,681
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

378
00:30:55,683 --> 00:30:59,729
To bring balance to the universe
by wiping out half of all life.

379
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:04,523
He used to kill people planet by planet,
massacre by massacre.

380
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:05,971
Including my own.

381
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,784
If he gets all six Infinity Stones,

382
00:31:07,795 --> 00:31:10,408
he can do it with the snap of his fingers
like this.

383
00:31:10,854 --> 00:31:13,494
You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.

384
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:17,604
Gamora is the daughter of Thanos.

385
00:31:21,642 --> 00:31:23,783
Your father killed my brother.

386
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,383
Oh, boy.

387
00:31:25,408 --> 00:31:27,135
Stepfather, technically.

388
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,096
And she hates him as much as you do.

389
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:34,518
Families can be tough.

390
00:31:34,543 --> 00:31:37,890
Before my father died,
he told me that I had a half-sister

391
00:31:37,892 --> 00:31:39,963
that he imprisoned in Hel.

392
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,408
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.

393
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:44,874
So I had to kill her.

394
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:46,823
That's life though, isn't it, I guess.

395
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,402
Goes round and round and...

396
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,379
I feel your pain.

397
00:31:50,404 --> 00:31:52,771
I feel your pain as well, because...

398
00:31:52,773 --> 00:31:55,407
I mean, it's not a competition,
but I've been through a lot.

399
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,908
My father killed my mother.
And then I had to kill my father.

400
00:31:59,034 --> 00:32:00,155
That was hard.

401
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,182
Probably even harder than
having to kill a sister.

402
00:32:03,494 --> 00:32:06,528
Plus, I came out with both my eyes,
which was...

403
00:32:06,553 --> 00:32:08,322
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

404
00:32:09,948 --> 00:32:13,268
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...

405
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,371
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

406
00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:18,205
Uh, what are you doing?

407
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,722
Taking your pod.

408
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,281
No, you're not.

409
00:32:24,122 --> 00:32:28,237
You will not be taking our pod today, sir.

410
00:32:28,568 --> 00:32:32,260
Uh...
Quill, are you making your voice deeper?

411
00:32:33,947 --> 00:32:35,549
- No.
- You are.

412
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,667
You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.

413
00:32:38,685 --> 00:32:39,713
No, I'm not.

414
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:42,188
- He just did it again!
- This is my voice.

415
00:32:48,225 --> 00:32:49,592
Are you mocking me?

416
00:32:49,737 --> 00:32:52,698
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.

417
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:55,423
- He's trying to copy me.
- I need you to stop doing that.

418
00:32:55,434 --> 00:32:57,267
- Enough!
- He's doing it first.

419
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:58,703
We need to stop Thanos.

420
00:32:58,705 --> 00:33:01,408
Which means we need to find out
where he's going next.

421
00:33:01,433 --> 00:33:02,766
Knowhere.

422
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:04,720
He must be going somewhere.

423
00:33:04,745 --> 00:33:06,752
No, no. Knowhere?

424
00:33:06,857 --> 00:33:09,725
It's a place. We've been there. It sucks.

425
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,952
Excuse me, that's our food.

426
00:33:10,976 --> 00:33:12,408
Not anymore.

427
00:33:12,596 --> 00:33:15,830
Thor, why would he go to Knowhere?

428
00:33:15,855 --> 00:33:17,320
Because for years,

429
00:33:17,356 --> 00:33:21,002
the Reality Stone's been safely stored
there with a man called the Collector.

430
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,711
If it's with the Collector,
then it's not safe.

431
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,505
Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

432
00:33:24,523 --> 00:33:25,395
Or a genius.

433
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,354
How do you know
he's not going for one of the other stones?

434
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:31,026
There are six stones out there.

435
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:33,849
Thanos already has the Power Stone

436
00:33:33,874 --> 00:33:37,424
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

437
00:33:37,654 --> 00:33:39,737
He stole the Space Stone from me

438
00:33:39,762 --> 00:33:42,629
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

439
00:33:42,692 --> 00:33:45,726
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.
They're with the Avengers.

440
00:33:45,751 --> 00:33:46,655
The Avengers?

441
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:48,285
Earth's mightiest heroes.

442
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:49,520
Like Kevin Bacon?

443
00:33:49,522 --> 00:33:51,889
He may be on the team. I don't know.
I haven't been there in a while.

444
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:54,458
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

445
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,929
No one even knows where it is.
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

446
00:33:57,964 --> 00:34:02,049
Therefore he's going to Knowhere.
Hence he'll be getting the Reality Stone.

447
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,210
You're welcome.

448
00:34:03,238 --> 00:34:04,779
Then we have to go to Knowhere now.

449
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:08,674
Wrong. Where we have to go is Nidavellir.

450
00:34:08,885 --> 00:34:10,885
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.

451
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:15,315
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?
That place is a legend.

452
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:19,307
They make the most powerful, horrific
weapons to ever torment the universe.

453
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:21,573
I would very much like to go there, please.

454
00:34:21,598 --> 00:34:23,979
The rabbit is correct
and clearly the smartest among you.

455
00:34:24,004 --> 00:34:24,901
Rabbit?

456
00:34:24,926 --> 00:34:27,580
Only Eitri the Dwarf can make me
the weapon I need.

457
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,059
I assume you're the captain, sir.

458
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:30,394
You're very perceptive.

459
00:34:30,396 --> 00:34:33,283
You seem like a noble leader.
Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?

460
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,323
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

461
00:34:36,348 --> 00:34:37,987
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!

462
00:34:38,012 --> 00:34:39,503
Uh, except for that I'm the captain.

463
00:34:39,505 --> 00:34:40,518
Quiet.

464
00:34:40,543 --> 00:34:42,221
- That's my backpack.
- Go sit down.

465
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,880
Look, this is my ship.

466
00:34:43,905 --> 00:34:45,971
And I'm not goin' to...

467
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:48,990
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

468
00:34:49,015 --> 00:34:50,776
The Thanos-killing kind.

469
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,793
Don't you think that
we should all have a weapon like that?

470
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:54,985
No. You simply lack the strength
to wield them.

471
00:34:54,987 --> 00:34:57,502
Your bodies would crumble
as your minds collapsed into madness.

472
00:34:57,527 --> 00:34:59,593
Is it weird that
I wanna do it even more now?

473
00:34:59,618 --> 00:35:00,760
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

474
00:35:00,785 --> 00:35:03,994
If we don't go to Knowhere
and Thanos retrieves another stone,

475
00:35:03,996 --> 00:35:05,643
he'll be too powerful to stop.

476
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:07,979
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.

477
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:11,501
We got two ships
and a large assortment of morons.

478
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,338
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

479
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,658
And the morons will go to Knowhere
to try to stop Thanos.

480
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,887
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

481
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:21,260
For the record,

482
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:24,671
I know that you're going with him
because it's where Thanos isn't.

483
00:35:24,683 --> 00:35:28,453
You know, you really shouldn't
talk that way to your captain, Quill.

484
00:35:29,397 --> 00:35:30,846
Come on, Groot.

485
00:35:31,123 --> 00:35:33,815
Put that game down. You'll rot your brain.

486
00:35:37,662 --> 00:35:40,252
I bid you farewell and good luck, morons.

487
00:35:40,618 --> 00:35:41,696
Bye.

488
00:35:56,558 --> 00:35:57,594
Vis?

489
00:35:58,028 --> 00:36:00,094
Is it the stone again?

490
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:01,820
It's as if it's speaking to me.

491
00:36:02,457 --> 00:36:04,054
What does it say?

492
00:36:05,025 --> 00:36:07,492
I don't... I don't know, but something.

493
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:10,862
Hey.

494
00:36:20,738 --> 00:36:22,544
Tell me what you feel.

495
00:36:30,216 --> 00:36:32,419
I just feel you.

496
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:43,125
So there's a 10:00 a.m. to Glasgow,

497
00:36:43,127 --> 00:36:45,302
which would give us more time together
before you went back.

498
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:46,827
What if I miss that train?

499
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:48,097
There's an 11:00.

500
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:50,365
What if I missed all the trains?

501
00:36:51,936 --> 00:36:53,836
What if this time I didn't go back?

502
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:55,438
But you gave Stark your word.

503
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,606
I'd rather give it to you.

504
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:00,179
Well, there are people who are expecting
me too, you know. We both made promises.

505
00:37:00,204 --> 00:37:01,794
Not to each other.

506
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:03,771
Wanda.

507
00:37:04,224 --> 00:37:08,793
For two years, we've stolen these moments
trying to see if this could work and...

508
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:10,013
I don't know.

509
00:37:10,832 --> 00:37:12,866
You know what,
I'm just gonna speak for myself.

510
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,846
I think...

511
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:16,058
- It works.
- It works.

512
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,341
It works.

513
00:37:19,645 --> 00:37:20,846
Stay.

514
00:37:21,813 --> 00:37:23,247
Stay with me.

515
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,310
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

516
00:37:38,665 --> 00:37:40,404
What are they?

517
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,155
What the stone was warning me about.

518
00:37:53,141 --> 00:37:54,673
I have to go.

519
00:37:54,698 --> 00:37:55,833
No, Vision.

520
00:37:56,177 --> 00:38:00,504
Vision, if that's true,
then maybe going isn't the best idea.

521
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:01,969
Wanda, I-

522
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,380
Vision!

523
00:38:32,669 --> 00:38:35,896
The blade, it stopped me from phasing.

524
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:38,574
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

525
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:41,380
My systems are failing.

526
00:38:42,049 --> 00:38:44,785
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.

527
00:38:47,285 --> 00:38:48,310
Vis!

528
00:38:57,444 --> 00:39:00,812
Give up the stone, and she lives.

529
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:40,059
Hands off.

530
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:57,295
Come on. Come on.

531
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,029
Come on, you gotta get up.

532
00:39:59,216 --> 00:40:01,657
You gotta get up. Come on. Hey.

533
00:40:02,725 --> 00:40:04,138
Hey. We have to go.

534
00:40:05,996 --> 00:40:08,490
Please. Please leave.

535
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,395
You asked me to stay.

536
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:12,935
- I'm staying.
- Please.

537
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,984
- Get up.
- I can't.

538
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:28,589
We don't wanna kill you, but we will.

539
00:41:28,872 --> 00:41:31,008
You'll never get the chance again.

540
00:41:46,889 --> 00:41:48,471
Can you stand?

541
00:41:53,269 --> 00:41:54,682
Thank you, Captain.

542
00:41:57,373 --> 00:41:59,018
Let's get you on the jet.

543
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:06,167
Now, I thought we had a deal.

544
00:42:06,492 --> 00:42:10,394
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.

545
00:42:10,419 --> 00:42:13,745
I'm sorry. We just wanted time.

546
00:42:16,425 --> 00:42:17,825
Where to, Cap?

547
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,987
Home.

548
00:42:25,361 --> 00:42:27,745
We'll be safe. We'll be safe.

549
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:53,404
Zehobereians.

550
00:42:53,429 --> 00:42:55,214
Mother! Where's my mother?

551
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,940
Choose a side or die.

552
00:42:56,965 --> 00:42:58,214
Mother!

553
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:03,972
One side is a revelation,
the other an honor known only to a few.

554
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:06,464
What's wrong, little one?

555
00:43:06,975 --> 00:43:10,311
My mother. Where is my mother?

556
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:16,301
What's your name?

557
00:43:17,586 --> 00:43:19,128
Gamora.

558
00:43:19,866 --> 00:43:21,969
You're quite the fighter, Gamora.

559
00:43:23,395 --> 00:43:25,920
Come. Let me help you.

560
00:43:39,374 --> 00:43:40,475
Look.

561
00:43:44,212 --> 00:43:46,042
Pretty, isn't it?

562
00:43:46,547 --> 00:43:50,011
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.

563
00:43:50,251 --> 00:43:54,055
Too much to one side or the other...

564
00:43:57,972 --> 00:44:00,841
Here. You try.

565
00:44:04,532 --> 00:44:07,801
Now, go in peace to meet your maker.

566
00:44:10,362 --> 00:44:11,393
Uh-uh.

567
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,319
Concentrate.

568
00:44:17,419 --> 00:44:20,255
There. You've got it.

569
00:44:29,657 --> 00:44:30,924
Gamora.

570
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:35,371
Do you know if these grenades are the
blow-off-your-junk kind or the gas kind?

571
00:44:35,396 --> 00:44:38,264
Because I was thinking about
hanging a couple on my belt right here.

572
00:44:38,266 --> 00:44:39,398
But I don't want to if they're the...

573
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,807
I need to ask a favor.

574
00:44:41,536 --> 00:44:43,004
Yeah, sure.

575
00:44:44,439 --> 00:44:47,974
One way or another,
the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

576
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:51,761
Which is what the grenades are for.

577
00:44:51,917 --> 00:44:54,518
Uh, I'm sorry. What's the favor?

578
00:44:56,651 --> 00:44:57,851
If things go wrong...

579
00:44:59,354 --> 00:45:01,456
If Thanos gets me...

580
00:45:06,093 --> 00:45:08,061
I want you to promise me...

581
00:45:09,096 --> 00:45:10,197
...you'll kill me.

582
00:45:10,989 --> 00:45:11,990
What?

583
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:17,206
I know something he doesn't.

584
00:45:20,073 --> 00:45:24,292
And if he finds it out,
the entire universe could be at risk.

585
00:45:24,344 --> 00:45:25,544
What do you know?

586
00:45:25,546 --> 00:45:27,582
If I tell you, you'd know too.

587
00:45:30,606 --> 00:45:32,539
If it's so important,

588
00:45:32,553 --> 00:45:33,719
shouldn't I?

589
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:34,886
Only if you wanna die.

590
00:45:34,888 --> 00:45:37,182
Why does somebody always have to die
in this scenario?

591
00:45:38,225 --> 00:45:39,226
Just...

592
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:44,409
Trust me. And possibly kill me.

593
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:47,214
I mean, I'd like to.

594
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:48,550
I really would. But you-

595
00:45:49,169 --> 00:45:50,337
Swear to me.

596
00:45:53,878 --> 00:45:55,909
Swear to me on your mother.

597
00:46:03,354 --> 00:46:04,355
Okay.

598
00:46:10,272 --> 00:46:11,373
Okay.

599
00:46:27,604 --> 00:46:28,776
- Oh.
- Dude.

600
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:30,475
How long have you been standing there?

601
00:46:30,766 --> 00:46:31,767
An hour.

602
00:46:31,963 --> 00:46:33,164
An hour?

603
00:46:33,699 --> 00:46:35,265
Are you serious?

604
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:40,233
I've mastered the ability
of standing so incredibly still...

605
00:46:41,421 --> 00:46:43,995
...that I become invisible to the eye.

606
00:46:44,591 --> 00:46:45,729
Watch.

607
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,284
You're eating a zarg-nut.

608
00:46:51,565 --> 00:46:53,098
But my movement...

609
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:55,469
...was so slow...

610
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,956
...that it's imperceptible.

611
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,204
Mmm, no.

612
00:47:00,425 --> 00:47:01,806
I'm sure I'm invisible.

613
00:47:01,808 --> 00:47:03,142
Hi, Drax.

614
00:47:05,712 --> 00:47:06,713
Damn it.

615
00:47:26,633 --> 00:47:28,430
This place looks deserted.

616
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:31,399
I'm reading movement in the third quadrant.

617
00:47:31,424 --> 00:47:33,358
Yep, I'm picking that up too.

618
00:47:34,774 --> 00:47:36,342
Let's put down right here.

619
00:47:48,153 --> 00:47:49,589
I don't have it.

620
00:47:51,691 --> 00:47:55,192
Everyone in the galaxy knows
you'd sell your own brother

621
00:47:55,194 --> 00:47:56,828
if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket

622
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:58,765
to your pathetic collection.

623
00:48:06,605 --> 00:48:09,927
I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan.

624
00:48:09,952 --> 00:48:13,322
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

625
00:48:16,682 --> 00:48:18,255
I told you.

626
00:48:19,175 --> 00:48:20,176
I sold it.

627
00:48:22,889 --> 00:48:25,115
Why would I lie?

628
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,373
I imagine it's like breathing for you.

629
00:48:28,237 --> 00:48:29,904
Like suicide.

630
00:48:30,068 --> 00:48:31,982
You do understand.

631
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:35,576
Not even you would surrender something
so precious.

632
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:37,400
I didn't know what it was.

633
00:48:37,425 --> 00:48:40,146
Then you're more of a fool than
I took you for.

634
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,369
It's him.

635
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:42,912
Last chance, charlatan.

636
00:48:44,662 --> 00:48:46,435
Where's the stone?

637
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:47,927
Today...

638
00:48:48,213 --> 00:48:49,313
Drax. Drax.

639
00:48:49,315 --> 00:48:51,381
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

640
00:48:51,406 --> 00:48:52,441
Drax, wait.

641
00:48:53,818 --> 00:48:55,452
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

642
00:48:55,454 --> 00:48:56,529
Drax.

643
00:49:00,536 --> 00:49:02,870
Drax, Drax, Drax. Listen to me.

644
00:49:02,895 --> 00:49:05,146
He doesn't have the stone yet.

645
00:49:05,408 --> 00:49:07,775
If we get it, then we can stop him.

646
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,998
We have to get the stone first. Yeah.

647
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,359
No.

648
00:49:12,384 --> 00:49:15,785
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

649
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:17,245
Sleep.

650
00:49:29,253 --> 00:49:34,261
Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

651
00:49:35,761 --> 00:49:37,097
The other right.

652
00:50:01,262 --> 00:50:02,909
Why?

653
00:50:12,998 --> 00:50:16,901
Why you, daughter?

654
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:36,830
That was quick.

655
00:50:42,593 --> 00:50:47,498
Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!

656
00:50:49,681 --> 00:50:52,451
Is that sadness I sense in you, daughter?

657
00:50:55,522 --> 00:50:58,124
In my heart, I knew you still cared.

658
00:51:05,463 --> 00:51:08,125
But one never knows for sure.

659
00:51:17,898 --> 00:51:20,767
Reality is often disappointing.

660
00:51:23,935 --> 00:51:26,094
That is, it was.

661
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:29,463
Now...

662
00:51:31,676 --> 00:51:34,352
...reality can be whatever I want.

663
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,559
You knew I'd come.

664
00:51:37,584 --> 00:51:39,141
I counted on it.

665
00:51:39,929 --> 00:51:42,774
There's something we need to discuss,
little one.

666
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,197
Thanos!

667
00:51:56,868 --> 00:51:57,902
No!

668
00:52:02,373 --> 00:52:04,060
Let her go, Grimace.

669
00:52:04,441 --> 00:52:05,442
Peter.

670
00:52:06,779 --> 00:52:08,068
I told you to go right.

671
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,033
Now? Really?

672
00:52:10,058 --> 00:52:11,646
You let her go!

673
00:52:11,943 --> 00:52:13,843
Ah, the boyfriend.

674
00:52:13,885 --> 00:52:14,995
No.

675
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:18,921
Like to think of myself more as
a Titan-killing, long-term booty call.

676
00:52:18,923 --> 00:52:21,067
- Let her go.
- Peter.

677
00:52:21,092 --> 00:52:25,863
I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin
right off your face.

678
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:27,721
Not him.

679
00:52:38,343 --> 00:52:41,914
You promised. You promised.

680
00:52:46,393 --> 00:52:47,748
Oh, daughter.

681
00:52:47,951 --> 00:52:50,271
You expect too much from him.

682
00:52:54,026 --> 00:52:55,692
She's asked, hasn't she?

683
00:52:59,568 --> 00:53:00,569
Do it.

684
00:53:04,534 --> 00:53:05,677
Mmm.

685
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,318
Do it!

686
00:53:15,163 --> 00:53:16,698
I told you to go right.

687
00:53:18,551 --> 00:53:21,302
I love you more than anything.

688
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:26,032
I love you too.

689
00:53:40,455 --> 00:53:41,490
I like him.

690
00:54:12,308 --> 00:54:14,168
Still no word from Vision?

691
00:54:14,193 --> 00:54:16,917
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

692
00:54:16,942 --> 00:54:20,852
On a stolen Quinjet with four of
the world's most wanted criminals.

693
00:54:20,877 --> 00:54:22,609
You know they're only criminals because

694
00:54:22,611 --> 00:54:24,145
you've chosen to call them that,
right, sir?

695
00:54:24,147 --> 00:54:28,714
My God, Rhodes.
Your talent for horseshit rivals my own.

696
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:31,870
If it weren't for those Accords,
Vision would've been right here.

697
00:54:32,147 --> 00:54:35,516
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.

698
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:36,956
That's right.

699
00:54:38,906 --> 00:54:40,906
And I'm pretty sure I paid for that.

700
00:54:40,931 --> 00:54:42,230
You have second thoughts?

701
00:54:42,232 --> 00:54:43,839
Not anymore.

702
00:54:49,872 --> 00:54:51,487
Mr. Secretary.

703
00:54:55,978 --> 00:54:57,713
You got some nerve.

704
00:54:58,248 --> 00:54:59,870
I'll give you that.

705
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:01,884
You could use some of that right now.

706
00:55:02,657 --> 00:55:05,065
The world's on fire.

707
00:55:05,709 --> 00:55:08,964
And you think all is forgiven?

708
00:55:09,328 --> 00:55:13,378
I'm not looking for forgiveness.
And I'm way past asking permission.

709
00:55:15,376 --> 00:55:19,168
Earth just lost her best defender.
So we're here to fight.

710
00:55:20,797 --> 00:55:22,732
And if you wanna stand in our way...

711
00:55:23,685 --> 00:55:25,378
...we'll fight you too.

712
00:55:29,168 --> 00:55:30,169
Arrest them.

713
00:55:31,014 --> 00:55:32,511
All over it.

714
00:55:37,714 --> 00:55:39,015
That's a court-martial.

715
00:55:41,623 --> 00:55:42,831
It's great to see you, Cap.

716
00:55:43,726 --> 00:55:45,183
You too, Rhodey.

717
00:55:45,594 --> 00:55:46,595
Hey.

718
00:55:48,214 --> 00:55:52,753
Wow. You guys... really look like crap.

719
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:54,878
Must've been a rough couple years.

720
00:55:54,903 --> 00:55:57,784
Yeah, well,
the hotels weren't exactly five star.

721
00:55:57,952 --> 00:56:00,086
Uh, I think you look great.

722
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:04,609
Uh...

723
00:56:07,216 --> 00:56:08,948
Yeah, I'm back.

724
00:56:10,986 --> 00:56:11,987
Hi, Bruce.

725
00:56:17,445 --> 00:56:18,446
Nat.

726
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:23,535
This is awkward.

727
00:56:25,847 --> 00:56:27,768
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?

728
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:29,037
And they can clearly find us.

729
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:31,448
We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?

730
00:56:31,473 --> 00:56:34,576
After the whole Accords situation,
he and Scott took a deal.

731
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:36,345
It was too tough on their families.
They're on house arrest.

732
00:56:36,378 --> 00:56:37,737
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

733
00:56:37,762 --> 00:56:39,401
There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?

734
00:56:40,226 --> 00:56:41,258
Okay, look.

735
00:56:41,283 --> 00:56:47,890
Thanos has the biggest army in the universe
and he is not gonna stop until he gets...

736
00:56:49,811 --> 00:56:50,924
...Vision's stone.

737
00:56:50,926 --> 00:56:52,259
Then we have to protect it.

738
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:53,985
No, we have to destroy it.

739
00:56:56,075 --> 00:56:58,708
I've been giving a good deal of thought
to this entity in my head.

740
00:56:58,733 --> 00:57:00,577
About its nature.

741
00:57:00,745 --> 00:57:03,014
But also its composition.

742
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:07,107
I think if it were exposed
to a sufficiently powerful energy source,

743
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:10,978
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...

744
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,944
...its molecular integrity could fail.

745
00:57:15,217 --> 00:57:17,538
Yeah, and you with it.

746
00:57:17,985 --> 00:57:19,662
We're not having this conversation.

747
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:23,804
Eliminating the stone is the only way
to be certain that Thanos can't get it.

748
00:57:24,193 --> 00:57:26,361
That's too high a price.

749
00:57:30,965 --> 00:57:33,268
Only you have the power to pay it.

750
00:57:37,649 --> 00:57:39,816
Thanos threatens half the universe.

751
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,202
One life cannot stand in the way
of defeating him.

752
00:57:42,356 --> 00:57:43,890
But it should.

753
00:57:46,257 --> 00:57:47,632
We don't trade lives, Vision.

754
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:51,889
Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your
life to save how many millions of people?

755
00:57:51,913 --> 00:57:54,147
Tell me, why is this any different?

756
00:57:54,172 --> 00:57:56,607
Because you might have a choice.

757
00:57:57,853 --> 00:58:01,822
Your mind is made up
of a complex construct of overlays.

758
00:58:01,863 --> 00:58:05,464
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the stone.

759
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,999
All of them mixed together,
all of them learning from one another.

760
00:58:09,214 --> 00:58:11,147
You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?

761
00:58:11,172 --> 00:58:15,975
I'm saying that if we take out the stone,
there's still a whole lot of Vision left.

762
00:58:15,977 --> 00:58:17,810
Perhaps the best parts.

763
00:58:17,812 --> 00:58:19,080
Can we do that?

764
00:58:19,659 --> 00:58:21,265
Not me, not here.

765
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:24,850
Well, you better find someone
and somewhere fast.

766
00:58:24,852 --> 00:58:27,388
Ross isn't just gonna let you guys
have your old rooms back.

767
00:58:30,338 --> 00:58:31,874
I know somewhere.

768
00:58:46,777 --> 00:58:49,412
The Kingsguard and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.

769
00:58:49,536 --> 00:58:51,184
And the Border Tribe?

770
00:58:51,374 --> 00:58:53,254
Those that are left.

771
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:57,809
Send word to the Jabari as well.
M'Baku likes a good fight.

772
00:58:59,829 --> 00:59:01,895
And what of this one?

773
00:59:02,183 --> 00:59:04,750
This one may be tired of war.

774
00:59:04,847 --> 00:59:07,883
But the White Wolf has rested long enough.

775
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:32,152
Where's the fight?

776
00:59:33,015 --> 00:59:34,351
On its way.

777
00:59:52,821 --> 00:59:55,291
In all the time I've served Thanos...

778
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:59,312
...I have never failed him.

779
01:00:04,384 --> 01:00:07,586
If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan

780
01:00:07,588 --> 01:00:11,590
with the Time Stone still attached
to your vaguely irritating person,

781
01:00:11,592 --> 01:00:14,261
there would be judgment.

782
01:00:22,904 --> 01:00:24,339
Give me...

783
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:29,351
...the stone.

784
01:00:41,892 --> 01:00:44,360
Wow, you're a seriously
loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?

785
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:46,367
Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...

786
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,367
What the...

787
01:00:48,392 --> 01:00:50,092
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.

788
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:51,162
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.

789
01:00:51,164 --> 01:00:52,865
But it was such a long way down
and I just thought about you on the way...

790
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:54,607
And now I gotta hear it.

791
01:00:54,632 --> 01:00:57,135
And this suit is ridiculously intuitive,
by the way.

792
01:00:57,137 --> 01:00:58,269
God damn it.

793
01:00:58,271 --> 01:01:00,906
So, if anything,
it's kinda your fault that I'm here.

794
01:01:01,078 --> 01:01:02,632
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

795
01:01:02,642 --> 01:01:04,208
And now, I'm here in space.

796
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:06,617
Yeah, right where I didn't want you to be.

797
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:10,214
This isn't Coney Island. This isn't
a field trip. This is a one-way ticket.

798
01:01:10,216 --> 01:01:12,050
You hear me?
Don't pretend you thought this through.

799
01:01:12,052 --> 01:01:13,151
No, I did think this through.

800
01:01:13,153 --> 01:01:14,951
You could not have possibly
thought this through.

801
01:01:14,953 --> 01:01:18,023
You can't be a friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.

802
01:01:20,293 --> 01:01:22,773
Okay, that didn't really make sense,
but you know what I'm trying to say.

803
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:27,679
Come on. We got a situation.

804
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:30,992
See him down there? He's in trouble.
What's your plan?

805
01:01:31,017 --> 01:01:32,525
- Go.
- Um...

806
01:01:32,915 --> 01:01:34,482
Okay, okay... Uh...

807
01:01:34,507 --> 01:01:37,711
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, Aliens?

808
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:43,609
Painful, aren't they?

809
01:01:44,351 --> 01:01:47,293
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

810
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,605
And any one of them...

811
01:01:55,171 --> 01:01:57,519
...could end your friend's life
in an instant.

812
01:01:57,574 --> 01:01:59,664
I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.

813
01:01:59,689 --> 01:02:02,301
Saving his life
is more of a professional courtesy.

814
01:02:04,236 --> 01:02:05,957
You've saved nothing.

815
01:02:06,939 --> 01:02:10,324
Your powers are inconsequential
compared to mine.

816
01:02:10,447 --> 01:02:12,148
Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.

817
01:02:26,006 --> 01:02:28,517
Yes! Wait. What are those?

818
01:02:44,295 --> 01:02:46,064
Hey, we haven't officially met.

819
01:02:47,212 --> 01:02:48,280
Cool.

820
01:02:50,259 --> 01:02:51,725
We gotta turn this ship around.

821
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:54,117
Yeah, now he wants to run. Great plan.

822
01:02:54,119 --> 01:02:55,552
No, I want to protect the stone.

823
01:02:55,554 --> 01:02:58,455
And I want you to thank me.
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

824
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,381
For what? Nearly blasting me into space?

825
01:03:01,427 --> 01:03:03,760
Who just saved your magical ass? Me.

826
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:05,930
I seriously don't know
how you fit your head into that helmet.

827
01:03:05,955 --> 01:03:08,609
Admit it, you should've ducked out
when I told you to.

828
01:03:08,634 --> 01:03:10,367
I tried to bench you. You refused.

829
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,436
Unlike everyone else in your life,
I don't work for you.

830
01:03:12,438 --> 01:03:14,009
And due to that fact,

831
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,422
we're now in a flying doughnut billions
of miles from Earth with no backup.

832
01:03:17,443 --> 01:03:19,384
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.

833
01:03:19,409 --> 01:03:20,577
The adults are talking.

834
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:23,361
I'm sorry,
I'm confused as to the relationship here.

835
01:03:23,386 --> 01:03:25,219
What is he, your ward?

836
01:03:25,244 --> 01:03:26,275
No.

837
01:03:26,685 --> 01:03:28,718
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

838
01:03:28,743 --> 01:03:30,512
Oh, you're using our made-up names. Um...

839
01:03:31,332 --> 01:03:32,962
I'm Spider-Man, then.

840
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,370
This ship is self-correcting its course.
Thing's on autopilot.

841
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:37,884
Can we control it?

842
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:39,728
Fly us home?

843
01:03:43,235 --> 01:03:44,283
- Stark?
- Yeah.

844
01:03:44,308 --> 01:03:45,641
Can you get us home?

845
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:47,066
Yeah, I heard you.

846
01:03:48,317 --> 01:03:50,619
I'm thinking I'm not so sure we should.

847
01:03:51,341 --> 01:03:55,486
Under no circumstances
can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos.

848
01:03:55,627 --> 01:03:57,853
I don't think you quite understand
what's at stake here.

849
01:03:57,878 --> 01:04:00,594
What? No.
It's you who doesn't understand

850
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:03,517
that Thanos has been inside my head
for six years.

851
01:04:03,542 --> 01:04:06,455
Since he sent an army to New York
and now he's back.

852
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:08,828
And I don't know what to do.

853
01:04:08,853 --> 01:04:12,202
So I'm not so sure if it's a better
plan to fight him on our turf or his,

854
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:15,751
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

855
01:04:16,106 --> 01:04:20,988
At least on his turf, he's not expecting
it. So I say we take the fight to him.

856
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:22,500
Doctor.

857
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:25,606
Do you concur?

858
01:04:28,246 --> 01:04:30,716
All right, Stark. We go to him.

859
01:04:31,783 --> 01:04:34,149
But you have to understand

860
01:04:34,151 --> 01:04:38,454
if it comes to saving you
or the kid or the Time Stone,

861
01:04:38,456 --> 01:04:41,274
I will not hesitate to let
either of you die.

862
01:04:42,115 --> 01:04:46,144
I can't,
because the universe depends on it.

863
01:04:46,397 --> 01:04:49,300
Nice. Good, moral compass.

864
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,041
We're straight.

865
01:04:53,096 --> 01:04:54,379
All right, kid.

866
01:04:55,874 --> 01:04:57,108
You're an Avenger now.

867
01:05:33,515 --> 01:05:35,673
I thought you might be hungry.

868
01:05:47,925 --> 01:05:49,725
I always hated that chair.

869
01:05:49,727 --> 01:05:51,783
So I've been told.

870
01:05:52,441 --> 01:05:56,379
Even so, I'd hoped you'd sit in it one day.

871
01:05:57,233 --> 01:05:58,618
I hated this room.

872
01:05:59,547 --> 01:06:00,743
This ship.

873
01:06:00,907 --> 01:06:02,595
I hated my life.

874
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,103
You told me that too.

875
01:06:12,634 --> 01:06:14,134
Every day.

876
01:06:16,763 --> 01:06:18,732
For almost 20 years.

877
01:06:21,312 --> 01:06:23,649
I was a child when you took me.

878
01:06:24,612 --> 01:06:25,879
I saved you.

879
01:06:29,326 --> 01:06:30,326
No.

880
01:06:31,902 --> 01:06:35,413
No. We were happy on my home planet.

881
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:36,936
Going to bed hungry,

882
01:06:37,384 --> 01:06:39,284
scrounging for scraps.

883
01:06:39,309 --> 01:06:44,178
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.
I'm the one who stopped that.

884
01:06:44,692 --> 01:06:46,692
Do you know what's happened since then?

885
01:06:46,717 --> 01:06:52,553
The children born have known nothing
but full bellies and clear skies.

886
01:06:52,578 --> 01:06:53,781
It's a paradise.

887
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,503
Because you murdered half the planet.

888
01:06:58,528 --> 01:07:01,539
A small price to pay for salvation.

889
01:07:01,564 --> 01:07:02,697
You're insane.

890
01:07:02,699 --> 01:07:04,799
Little one, it's a simple calculus.

891
01:07:04,801 --> 01:07:08,210
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

892
01:07:08,235 --> 01:07:12,194
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

893
01:07:12,573 --> 01:07:13,655
It needs correction.

894
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,181
You don't know that!

895
01:07:16,725 --> 01:07:19,288
I'm the only one who knows that.

896
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:23,661
At least, I'm the only one with the will
to act on it.

897
01:07:25,455 --> 01:07:26,444
For a time,

898
01:07:28,925 --> 01:07:33,329
you had that same will...

899
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:37,333
...as you fought by my side.

900
01:07:38,035 --> 01:07:39,269
Daughter.

901
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,738
I'm not your daughter.

902
01:07:44,274 --> 01:07:46,876
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

903
01:07:47,711 --> 01:07:51,514
And, in doing so,
made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy.

904
01:07:54,451 --> 01:07:57,320
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

905
01:08:00,623 --> 01:08:03,222
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

906
01:08:04,368 --> 01:08:06,644
I am disappointed.

907
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:09,666
But not because you didn't find it.

908
01:08:13,269 --> 01:08:14,938
But because you did.

909
01:08:16,394 --> 01:08:18,183
And you lied.

910
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:36,413
Nebula.

911
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:45,074
Don't do this.

912
01:08:45,101 --> 01:08:49,436
Some time ago, your sister
snuck aboard this ship to kill me.

913
01:08:49,438 --> 01:08:50,504
Please don't do this.

914
01:08:50,529 --> 01:08:52,652
And very nearly succeeded.

915
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:54,844
So I brought her here.

916
01:08:56,446 --> 01:08:57,647
To talk.

917
01:09:05,387 --> 01:09:07,675
Stop. Stop it.

918
01:09:13,606 --> 01:09:18,581
I swear to you on my life.
I never found the Soul Stone.

919
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,615
Accessing memory files.

920
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,041
You know what he's about to do.

921
01:09:26,043 --> 01:09:28,842
He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.

922
01:09:28,844 --> 01:09:30,045
- All of them.
- He can never get them all.

923
01:09:30,047 --> 01:09:31,112
He will!

924
01:09:31,129 --> 01:09:33,081
He can't, Nebula.

925
01:09:33,382 --> 01:09:38,644
Because I found the map to the Soul Stone
and I burned it to ash. I burned it.

926
01:09:43,567 --> 01:09:45,402
You're strong.

927
01:09:47,484 --> 01:09:48,485
Me.

928
01:09:51,034 --> 01:09:52,701
You're generous.

929
01:09:53,969 --> 01:09:54,970
Me.

930
01:09:56,972 --> 01:09:59,449
But I never taught you to lie.

931
01:09:59,594 --> 01:10:02,066
That's why you're so bad at it.

932
01:10:04,513 --> 01:10:08,870
Where is the Soul Stone?

933
01:10:26,468 --> 01:10:27,469
Vormir!

934
01:10:45,587 --> 01:10:47,055
The stone is on Vormir.

935
01:10:50,366 --> 01:10:52,188
Show me.

936
01:10:54,707 --> 01:10:56,106
I am Groot.

937
01:10:56,131 --> 01:10:58,829
Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking.
What's there to see?

938
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:01,120
What's a twig?
Everybody's seen a twig before.

939
01:11:01,145 --> 01:11:02,501
I am Groot.

940
01:11:02,526 --> 01:11:05,368
Tree, pour what's in the cup
out into space and go in the cup again.

941
01:11:05,393 --> 01:11:06,492
You speak Groot?

942
01:11:06,517 --> 01:11:08,685
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

943
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:09,876
I am Groot.

944
01:11:09,901 --> 01:11:12,034
You'll know when we're close.

945
01:11:12,064 --> 01:11:15,968
Nidavellir's forge harnesses
the blazing power of a neutron star.

946
01:11:18,854 --> 01:11:23,157
It's the birthplace of my hammer.
It's truly awesome.

947
01:11:29,264 --> 01:11:32,509
Okay, time to be the captain.

948
01:11:37,485 --> 01:11:39,423
So, dead brother, huh?

949
01:11:39,448 --> 01:11:41,716
Yeah, that could be annoying.

950
01:11:41,869 --> 01:11:43,770
Well, he's been dead before.

951
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,946
But, no,
this time I think it really might be true.

952
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:50,782
And you said your sister and your dad?

953
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:52,204
Both dead.

954
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:54,688
But still got a mom, though?

955
01:11:54,933 --> 01:11:56,266
Killed by a dark elf.

956
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:57,509
A best friend?

957
01:11:57,534 --> 01:11:59,024
Stabbed through the heart.

958
01:12:02,139 --> 01:12:05,391
You sure you're up to
this particular murder mission?

959
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,178
Absolutely.

960
01:12:09,203 --> 01:12:14,673
Rage and vengeance, anger, loss, regret,
they're all tremendous motivators.

961
01:12:14,675 --> 01:12:17,634
They really clear the mind.
So I'm good to go.

962
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:22,959
Yeah, but this Thanos we're talkin' about,
he's the toughest there is.

963
01:12:22,984 --> 01:12:25,217
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

964
01:12:25,242 --> 01:12:27,201
He's never fought me twice.

965
01:12:27,598 --> 01:12:29,532
And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.

966
01:12:29,557 --> 01:12:31,592
It better be some hammer.

967
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:38,381
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

968
01:12:38,876 --> 01:12:41,043
I've killed twice as many enemies as that.

969
01:12:41,068 --> 01:12:44,373
And every one of them would've
rather killed me, but none succeeded.

970
01:12:44,816 --> 01:12:47,670
I'm only alive because fate wants me alive.

971
01:12:47,695 --> 01:12:50,771
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards

972
01:12:50,796 --> 01:12:54,599
and he'll be the latest to feel
my vengeance. Fate wills it so.

973
01:12:54,624 --> 01:12:55,787
Mmm-hmm.

974
01:12:56,043 --> 01:12:57,810
And what if you're wrong?

975
01:13:01,278 --> 01:13:05,960
If I'm wrong, then...
what more could I lose?

976
01:13:19,471 --> 01:13:22,964
I could lose a lot.
Me, personally, I could lose a lot.

977
01:13:27,114 --> 01:13:28,115
Okay.

978
01:13:31,185 --> 01:13:33,385
If fate does want you to kill
that crapsack,

979
01:13:33,387 --> 01:13:35,287
you're gonna need
more than one stupid eyeball.

980
01:13:35,289 --> 01:13:37,310
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

981
01:13:37,608 --> 01:13:40,336
Some jerk lost a bet with me on Contraxia.

982
01:13:40,361 --> 01:13:41,759
He gave you his eye?

983
01:13:41,761 --> 01:13:42,995
No, he gave me 100 credits.

984
01:13:42,997 --> 01:13:45,965
I snuck into his room later that night
and stole his eye.

985
01:13:47,878 --> 01:13:49,145
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

986
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:50,171
Hmm.

987
01:13:52,818 --> 01:13:53,795
Huh?

988
01:13:55,847 --> 01:13:56,943
Oh.

989
01:13:57,344 --> 01:13:58,974
I would've washed that.

990
01:13:59,889 --> 01:14:02,302
The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia
was up my-

991
01:14:03,569 --> 01:14:04,790
Hey, we're here!

992
01:14:08,876 --> 01:14:11,607
I don't think this thing works.
Everything seems dark.

993
01:14:13,762 --> 01:14:15,529
It ain't the eye.

994
01:14:29,012 --> 01:14:30,314
Something's wrong.

995
01:14:31,211 --> 01:14:32,846
The star's gone out.

996
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:35,222
And the rings are frozen.

997
01:14:56,302 --> 01:14:59,804
I hope these dwarves are better
at forging than they are cleaning.

998
01:15:04,921 --> 01:15:08,123
Maybe they realized that they live
in a junk pile in the middle of space.

999
01:15:08,148 --> 01:15:10,883
This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries.

1000
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:16,164
You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?

1001
01:15:16,189 --> 01:15:17,455
Yes, why?

1002
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,714
It look anything like that?

1003
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:24,477
I am Groot.

1004
01:15:24,758 --> 01:15:26,219
Go back to the pod.

1005
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,474
Eitri, wait!

1006
01:15:32,405 --> 01:15:33,406
Stop!

1007
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:35,341
Stop.

1008
01:15:36,109 --> 01:15:37,110
Thor?

1009
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:41,852
What happened here?

1010
01:15:42,059 --> 01:15:44,665
You were supposed to protect us.

1011
01:15:45,362 --> 01:15:48,196
Asgard was supposed to protect us.

1012
01:15:48,221 --> 01:15:50,390
Asgard is destroyed.

1013
01:15:52,672 --> 01:15:56,368
Eitri, the glove. What did you do?

1014
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:12,192
300 dwarves lived on this ring.

1015
01:16:13,684 --> 01:16:16,620
I thought if I did what he asked,
they'd be safe.

1016
01:16:19,047 --> 01:16:20,616
I made what he wanted.

1017
01:16:22,254 --> 01:16:26,529
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

1018
01:16:30,975 --> 01:16:33,443
Then he killed everyone anyway.

1019
01:16:35,775 --> 01:16:37,610
All except me.

1020
01:16:38,702 --> 01:16:40,404
"Your life is yours," he said.

1021
01:16:41,869 --> 01:16:45,695
"But your hands are mine alone."

1022
01:16:46,682 --> 01:16:48,742
Eitri, this isn't about your hands.

1023
01:16:49,902 --> 01:16:53,103
Every weapon you've ever designed,
every axe, hammer, sword,

1024
01:16:53,128 --> 01:16:55,359
it's all inside your head.

1025
01:16:56,232 --> 01:16:59,796
Now, I know it feels like all hope is lost.
Trust me, I know.

1026
01:17:00,293 --> 01:17:05,065
But together, you and I,
we can kill Thanos.

1027
01:17:45,504 --> 01:17:50,211
Mantis, listen very carefully.
I need you to meet me on Titan.

1028
01:17:56,858 --> 01:17:58,091
Hey, what's going on?

1029
01:17:58,116 --> 01:17:59,416
I think we're here.

1030
01:17:59,418 --> 01:18:01,820
I don't think
this rig has a self-park function.

1031
01:18:03,422 --> 01:18:06,325
Get your hand inside the steering gimbal.
Close those around it.

1032
01:18:07,863 --> 01:18:09,206
- You understand?
- Yep, got it.

1033
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:11,289
This was meant for one big guy,
so we gotta move at the same time.

1034
01:18:11,309 --> 01:18:12,398
Okay, okay. Ready.

1035
01:18:16,578 --> 01:18:18,077
We might wanna turn.

1036
01:18:18,102 --> 01:18:19,304
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1037
01:18:49,054 --> 01:18:50,552
You all right?

1038
01:18:52,169 --> 01:18:53,472
That was close.

1039
01:18:54,878 --> 01:18:56,232
I owe you one.

1040
01:18:56,552 --> 01:19:00,643
Let me just say, if aliens wind up
implanting eggs in my chest or something,

1041
01:19:00,657 --> 01:19:01,829
and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.

1042
01:19:01,865 --> 01:19:04,413
I do not want another
single pop culture reference

1043
01:19:04,415 --> 01:19:06,148
out of you for the rest of the trip.
You understand?

1044
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:07,830
I'm trying to say that something is coming.

1045
01:19:14,785 --> 01:19:15,853
Thanos!

1046
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:39,048
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Please don't put your eggs in me!

1047
01:19:40,854 --> 01:19:42,307
Stay down, clown.

1048
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:50,194
Die, blanket of death!

1049
01:19:56,133 --> 01:19:59,069
Everybody stay where you are.
Chill the eff out.

1050
01:20:00,237 --> 01:20:02,190
I'm gonna ask you this one time.

1051
01:20:02,845 --> 01:20:04,177
Where is Gamora?

1052
01:20:04,202 --> 01:20:06,987
Yeah. I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?

1053
01:20:07,188 --> 01:20:10,156
I'll do you one better. Why is Gamora?

1054
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:13,449
Tell me where the girl is or I swear to you
I'm gonna French fry this little freak.

1055
01:20:13,451 --> 01:20:16,182
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1056
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:19,323
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

1057
01:20:19,348 --> 01:20:21,518
- No, he can't take it!
- She's right. You can't.

1058
01:20:21,543 --> 01:20:24,135
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell me
where she is? That's fine.

1059
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:27,262
I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself.

1060
01:20:27,264 --> 01:20:28,330
Starting with you.

1061
01:20:28,332 --> 01:20:29,264
Wait, what, Thanos?

1062
01:20:29,266 --> 01:20:31,753
All right, let me ask you this one time.

1063
01:20:32,021 --> 01:20:33,779
What master do you serve?

1064
01:20:33,804 --> 01:20:36,706
What master do I serve?
What am I supposed to say, "Jesus"?

1065
01:20:37,608 --> 01:20:38,507
You're from Earth.

1066
01:20:38,509 --> 01:20:41,104
- I'm not from Earth, I'm from Missouri.
- Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.

1067
01:20:41,129 --> 01:20:42,544
What are you hassling us for?

1068
01:20:42,569 --> 01:20:44,221
So you're not with Thanos?

1069
01:20:44,748 --> 01:20:46,807
With Thanos?

1070
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:50,475
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.
He took my girl.

1071
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,042
Wait, who are you?

1072
01:20:52,567 --> 01:20:54,399
- We're the Avengers, man.
- Oh.

1073
01:20:54,424 --> 01:20:56,792
You're the ones Thor told us about.

1074
01:20:56,794 --> 01:20:58,128
You know Thor?

1075
01:20:58,153 --> 01:21:02,034
Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking,
needed saving.

1076
01:21:02,059 --> 01:21:03,464
Where is he now?

1077
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:20,704
This is the plan?
We're gonna hit him with a brick?

1078
01:21:20,729 --> 01:21:24,089
It's a mold. A king's weapon.

1079
01:21:24,631 --> 01:21:27,104
Meant to be the greatest in Asgard.

1080
01:21:27,601 --> 01:21:30,432
In theory,
it could even summon the Bifrost.

1081
01:21:30,613 --> 01:21:32,003
Did it have a name?

1082
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:34,862
Stormbreaker.

1083
01:21:35,021 --> 01:21:36,122
That's a bit much.

1084
01:21:38,174 --> 01:21:39,385
So how do we make it?

1085
01:21:41,055 --> 01:21:43,224
You'll have to restart the forge.

1086
01:21:44,168 --> 01:21:46,479
Awaken the heart of a dying star.

1087
01:21:49,118 --> 01:21:51,620
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1088
01:21:55,365 --> 01:21:57,466
The hell happened to this planet?

1089
01:21:57,515 --> 01:22:01,624
It's eight degrees off its axis.
Gravitational pull is all over the place.

1090
01:22:02,892 --> 01:22:05,795
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

1091
01:22:06,633 --> 01:22:09,467
We'll use it. All right, I have a plan.

1092
01:22:09,509 --> 01:22:10,842
Or at least the beginnings of one.

1093
01:22:10,867 --> 01:22:13,701
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,
pin him down, get what we need.

1094
01:22:13,703 --> 01:22:16,709
Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy.
We just want the gauntlet.

1095
01:22:17,073 --> 01:22:18,444
Are you yawning?

1096
01:22:19,576 --> 01:22:21,842
In the middle of this,
while I'm breaking it down? Huh?

1097
01:22:21,844 --> 01:22:23,436
Did you hear what I said?

1098
01:22:23,656 --> 01:22:26,069
I stopped listening after you said,
"We need a plan."

1099
01:22:26,094 --> 01:22:27,281
Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

1100
01:22:27,283 --> 01:22:29,920
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.

1101
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:32,045
Uh, what exactly is it that they do?

1102
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:33,670
Kick names, take ass.

1103
01:22:33,695 --> 01:22:35,076
Yeah, that's right.

1104
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:43,508
All right, just get over here, please.

1105
01:22:43,533 --> 01:22:45,600
Mr. Lord,
can you get your folks to circle up?

1106
01:22:45,602 --> 01:22:47,623
"Mr. Lord". Star-Lord is fine.

1107
01:22:50,483 --> 01:22:51,849
We gotta coalesce.

1108
01:22:51,874 --> 01:22:53,708
'Cause if all we come at him with
is a plucky attitude...

1109
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:57,608
Dude, don't call us plucky.
We don't know what it means.

1110
01:22:57,724 --> 01:23:00,475
All right, we're optimistic, yes.
I like your plan.

1111
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:05,178
Except it sucks, so let me do the plan
and that way it might be really good.

1112
01:23:05,203 --> 01:23:07,310
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

1113
01:23:07,335 --> 01:23:09,570
- What dance-off?
- It's nothing.

1114
01:23:09,595 --> 01:23:10,761
Like in Footloose, the movie?

1115
01:23:10,786 --> 01:23:12,326
Exactly like Footloose.

1116
01:23:12,743 --> 01:23:14,475
Is it still the greatest movie in history?

1117
01:23:14,496 --> 01:23:15,730
It never was.

1118
01:23:15,732 --> 01:23:16,973
- Don't encourage this, all right?
- Okay.

1119
01:23:16,998 --> 01:23:18,822
We're getting no help
from Flash Gordon here.

1120
01:23:18,846 --> 01:23:21,595
Flash Gordon?
By the way, that's a compliment.

1121
01:23:21,638 --> 01:23:23,370
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1122
01:23:23,395 --> 01:23:24,912
So that 50% of me that's stupid,

1123
01:23:25,975 --> 01:23:27,232
that's 100% you.

1124
01:23:27,257 --> 01:23:28,523
Your math is blowing my mind.

1125
01:23:28,548 --> 01:23:29,783
Excuse me.

1126
01:23:30,813 --> 01:23:34,349
But does your friend often do that?

1127
01:23:35,637 --> 01:23:37,842
Strange, we all right?

1128
01:23:48,264 --> 01:23:49,506
You're back. You're all right.

1129
01:23:50,155 --> 01:23:51,668
Hey, what was that?

1130
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:55,943
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

1131
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:59,162
To see all the possible outcomes
of the coming conflict.

1132
01:24:00,423 --> 01:24:01,885
How many did you see?

1133
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:03,990
14,000,605.

1134
01:24:05,816 --> 01:24:07,351
How many did we win?

1135
01:24:11,987 --> 01:24:13,248
One.

1136
01:24:35,044 --> 01:24:37,412
The stone had better be up there.

1137
01:24:39,948 --> 01:24:41,983
For your sister's sake.

1138
01:25:02,904 --> 01:25:07,709
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1139
01:25:09,755 --> 01:25:13,248
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1140
01:25:13,273 --> 01:25:14,540
You know us?

1141
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:18,857
It is my curse to know
all who journey here.

1142
01:25:19,527 --> 01:25:21,261
Where is the Soul Stone?

1143
01:25:21,923 --> 01:25:27,448
You should know
it extracts a terrible price.

1144
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:30,391
I am prepared.

1145
01:25:32,707 --> 01:25:35,242
We all think that at first.

1146
01:25:39,697 --> 01:25:41,933
We are all wrong.

1147
01:25:53,616 --> 01:25:56,054
How is it you know this place so well?

1148
01:25:56,091 --> 01:26:00,656
A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones.

1149
01:26:00,898 --> 01:26:07,976
I even held one in my hand.
But it cast me out, banished me here.

1150
01:26:08,004 --> 01:26:12,041
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.

1151
01:26:20,776 --> 01:26:23,712
What you seek lies in front of you.

1152
01:26:24,452 --> 01:26:26,555
As does what you fear.

1153
01:26:27,566 --> 01:26:29,172
What's this?

1154
01:26:29,316 --> 01:26:30,758
The price.

1155
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:36,104
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

1156
01:26:36,872 --> 01:26:40,943
You might say it has a certain wisdom.

1157
01:26:42,374 --> 01:26:44,374
Tell me what it needs.

1158
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:50,489
To ensure that whoever possesses it
understands its power,

1159
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:55,445
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1160
01:26:55,470 --> 01:26:56,801
Of what?

1161
01:26:57,338 --> 01:27:01,762
In order to take the stone,
you must lose that which you love.

1162
01:27:04,825 --> 01:27:07,995
A soul for a soul.

1163
01:27:23,777 --> 01:27:31,777
All my life, I dreamed of a day,
a moment when you got what you deserved.

1164
01:27:33,935 --> 01:27:36,340
And I was always so disappointed.

1165
01:27:39,778 --> 01:27:41,216
But now...

1166
01:27:45,356 --> 01:27:52,270
You kill and torture...
and you call it mercy.

1167
01:27:56,459 --> 01:27:58,528
The universe has judged you.

1168
01:28:00,028 --> 01:28:04,598
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

1169
01:28:06,104 --> 01:28:07,704
You failed.

1170
01:28:09,008 --> 01:28:10,909
And do you wanna know why?

1171
01:28:11,891 --> 01:28:15,906
Because you love nothing. No one.

1172
01:28:21,734 --> 01:28:22,869
No.

1173
01:28:27,541 --> 01:28:28,542
Really?

1174
01:28:29,491 --> 01:28:30,559
Tears?

1175
01:28:31,354 --> 01:28:33,322
They're not for him.

1176
01:28:47,639 --> 01:28:48,695
No.

1177
01:28:50,154 --> 01:28:51,688
This isn't love.

1178
01:28:52,565 --> 01:28:55,195
I ignored my destiny once.

1179
01:28:57,577 --> 01:28:59,750
I cannot do that again.

1180
01:29:00,407 --> 01:29:03,617
Even for you.

1181
01:29:27,884 --> 01:29:30,185
I'm sorry, little one.

1182
01:29:34,173 --> 01:29:35,574
No!

1183
01:31:12,352 --> 01:31:15,353
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1184
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:17,359
I hope you're right about this.

1185
01:31:17,384 --> 01:31:20,156
Or we're gonna land a lot faster
than you want to.

1186
01:31:36,094 --> 01:31:38,862
When you said we were going to open Wakanda
to the rest of the world,

1187
01:31:38,864 --> 01:31:41,164
this is not what I imagined.

1188
01:31:41,166 --> 01:31:43,210
And what did you imagine?

1189
01:31:43,235 --> 01:31:46,218
The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks.

1190
01:32:00,485 --> 01:32:02,046
Should we bow?

1191
01:32:02,071 --> 01:32:03,406
Yeah, he's a king.

1192
01:32:03,722 --> 01:32:05,723
Seems like I'm always thanking you
for something.

1193
01:32:07,562 --> 01:32:09,031
What are you doing?

1194
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:11,189
Uh, we don't do that here.

1195
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:13,515
So how big of an assault should we expect?

1196
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:16,875
Uh, sir, I think you should expect
quite a big assault.

1197
01:32:16,902 --> 01:32:17,967
How we looking?

1198
01:32:17,969 --> 01:32:23,054
You will have my Kingsguard,
the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...

1199
01:32:23,831 --> 01:32:26,687
And a semi-stable 100-year-old man.

1200
01:32:29,547 --> 01:32:31,025
How you been, Buck?

1201
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:34,000
Uh, not bad, for the end of the world.

1202
01:32:45,963 --> 01:32:47,062
Whoa.

1203
01:32:47,299 --> 01:32:49,617
The structure is polymorphic.

1204
01:32:49,911 --> 01:32:53,145
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.

1205
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:57,070
Why didn't you just reprogram
the synapses to work collectively?

1206
01:32:58,276 --> 01:33:01,640
Because we didn't think of it.

1207
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:03,356
I'm sure you did your best.

1208
01:33:03,381 --> 01:33:04,734
Can you do it?

1209
01:33:05,483 --> 01:33:08,984
Yes, but there are more than
two trillion neurons here.

1210
01:33:09,009 --> 01:33:12,444
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.

1211
01:33:12,521 --> 01:33:13,898
It will take time, brother.

1212
01:33:15,453 --> 01:33:16,390
How long?

1213
01:33:16,415 --> 01:33:17,921
As long as you can give me.

1214
01:33:22,333 --> 01:33:24,367
Something's entered the atmosphere.

1215
01:33:41,385 --> 01:33:43,695
Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.

1216
01:33:53,234 --> 01:33:54,830
God, I love this place.

1217
01:33:54,832 --> 01:33:58,906
Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys.
We got more incoming outside the dome.

1218
01:34:18,207 --> 01:34:19,274
It's too late.

1219
01:34:20,201 --> 01:34:22,067
We need to destroy the stone now.

1220
01:34:22,092 --> 01:34:23,925
Vision, get your ass back on the table.

1221
01:34:23,927 --> 01:34:25,327
We will hold them off.

1222
01:34:25,329 --> 01:34:30,001
Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head, you blow it to hell.

1223
01:34:30,232 --> 01:34:31,431
I will.

1224
01:34:31,456 --> 01:34:34,507
Evacuate the city. Engage all defenses.

1225
01:34:35,172 --> 01:34:36,609
And get this man a shield.

1226
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:49,561
I don't think you get the scientifics here.

1227
01:34:49,592 --> 01:34:52,131
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving,

1228
01:34:52,156 --> 01:34:54,757
you're gonna need something a lot bigger
to yank 'em loose.

1229
01:34:54,782 --> 01:34:56,890
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?

1230
01:34:56,915 --> 01:35:00,083
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a-

1231
01:35:08,505 --> 01:35:09,656
Fire the engines!

1232
01:35:27,156 --> 01:35:29,614
More power, rabbit!

1233
01:36:01,257 --> 01:36:02,864
Well done, boy.

1234
01:36:04,728 --> 01:36:06,662
That's Nidavellir.

1235
01:36:26,887 --> 01:36:28,036
Damn it.

1236
01:36:28,211 --> 01:36:29,911
"Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

1237
01:36:29,936 --> 01:36:31,335
The mechanism is crippled.

1238
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:32,048
What?

1239
01:36:32,072 --> 01:36:34,106
With the iris closed, 
I can't heat the metal.

1240
01:36:34,131 --> 01:36:35,931
How long will it take to heat it?

1241
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:38,215
A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

1242
01:36:40,296 --> 01:36:41,462
I'm gonna hold it open.

1243
01:36:41,464 --> 01:36:42,696
That's suicide.

1244
01:36:42,698 --> 01:36:45,234
So is facing Thanos without that axe.

1245
01:36:54,676 --> 01:36:55,950
How we looking, Bruce?

1246
01:36:55,975 --> 01:36:57,950
Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

1247
01:37:01,014 --> 01:37:03,147
Wow! This is amazing, man.

1248
01:37:03,172 --> 01:37:05,172
It's like being the Hulk without actually-

1249
01:37:09,023 --> 01:37:11,193
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1250
01:37:12,616 --> 01:37:14,916
I've got two heat signatures
breaking through the tree line.

1251
01:37:43,225 --> 01:37:45,606
Thank you for standing with us.

1252
01:38:07,477 --> 01:38:09,096
Where's your other friend?

1253
01:38:09,803 --> 01:38:12,304
You will pay for his life with yours.

1254
01:38:13,141 --> 01:38:15,611
Thanos will have that stone.

1255
01:38:16,056 --> 01:38:17,556
That's not gonna happen.

1256
01:38:17,581 --> 01:38:19,979
You are in Wakanda now.

1257
01:38:20,135 --> 01:38:23,627
Thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood.

1258
01:38:24,736 --> 01:38:28,994
We have blood to spare.

1259
01:38:40,382 --> 01:38:41,816
They surrender?

1260
01:38:42,588 --> 01:38:43,653
Not exactly.

1261
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:12,213
What the hell?

1262
01:39:14,971 --> 01:39:16,538
Looks like we pissed her off.

1263
01:39:27,495 --> 01:39:28,943
They're killing themselves.

1264
01:40:05,293 --> 01:40:06,827
You see the teeth on those things?

1265
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:09,122
All right, back up, Sam.
You're gonna get your wings singed.

1266
01:40:21,548 --> 01:40:24,083
Cap, if these things circle the perimeter
and get in behind us,

1267
01:40:24,085 --> 01:40:26,286
there's nothing between them and Vision.

1268
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:28,397
Then we better keep 'em in front of us.

1269
01:40:28,422 --> 01:40:29,690
How do we do that?

1270
01:40:31,907 --> 01:40:33,608
We open the barrier.

1271
01:40:35,897 --> 01:40:40,278
On my signal,
open North-West Section Seventeen.

1272
01:40:40,409 --> 01:40:44,294
Requesting confirmation, My King.
You said open the barrier?

1273
01:40:44,304 --> 01:40:45,450
On my signal.

1274
01:40:45,673 --> 01:40:47,574
This will be the end of Wakanda.

1275
01:40:48,842 --> 01:40:52,192
Then it will be
the noblest ending in history.

1276
01:41:05,126 --> 01:41:06,659
Wakanda forever!

1277
01:41:19,398 --> 01:41:20,399
Now!

1278
01:41:50,514 --> 01:41:51,981
How much longer, Shuri?

1279
01:41:52,006 --> 01:41:53,617
I've barely begun, brother.

1280
01:41:53,642 --> 01:41:55,510
You might want to pick up the pace.

1281
01:42:02,643 --> 01:42:04,676
Allfathers, give me strength.

1282
01:42:04,718 --> 01:42:06,624
You understand, boy?

1283
01:42:06,649 --> 01:42:09,652
You're about to take
the full force of a star.

1284
01:42:10,532 --> 01:42:12,007
It'll kill you.

1285
01:42:12,592 --> 01:42:14,507
Only if I die.

1286
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:19,532
Yes. That's what killing you means.

1287
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:49,345
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

1288
01:43:39,713 --> 01:43:41,716
Thor! Say something. Come on.

1289
01:43:42,748 --> 01:43:43,749
Thor, you okay?

1290
01:43:49,425 --> 01:43:50,792
I think he's dying.

1291
01:43:50,817 --> 01:43:52,785
He needs the axe!

1292
01:43:54,130 --> 01:43:55,598
Where's the handle?

1293
01:43:58,698 --> 01:44:01,062
Tree, help me find the handle!

1294
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:11,531
There's too many of 'em!

1295
01:45:39,398 --> 01:45:41,766
You guys are so screwed now!

1296
01:45:45,203 --> 01:45:47,270
Bring me Thanos!

1297
01:46:19,904 --> 01:46:21,297
Oh, yeah.

1298
01:46:24,607 --> 01:46:26,609
You're much more of a Thanos.

1299
01:46:28,925 --> 01:46:30,867
I take it the Maw is dead.

1300
01:46:33,179 --> 01:46:35,748
This day extracts a heavy toll.

1301
01:46:37,476 --> 01:46:39,977
Still, he accomplished his mission.

1302
01:46:40,191 --> 01:46:41,793
You may regret that.

1303
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:45,414
He brought you face-to-face
with the Master of the Mystic Arts.

1304
01:46:48,629 --> 01:46:50,898
And where do you think he brought you?

1305
01:46:52,137 --> 01:46:54,906
Let me guess. Your home?

1306
01:46:59,210 --> 01:47:00,644
It was.

1307
01:47:03,325 --> 01:47:04,859
And it was beautiful.

1308
01:47:07,212 --> 01:47:13,016
Titan was like most planets.
Too many mouths, not enough to go around.

1309
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:16,227
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

1310
01:47:17,228 --> 01:47:18,789
Genocide.

1311
01:47:19,164 --> 01:47:23,234
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.

1312
01:47:24,568 --> 01:47:26,672
They called me a madman.

1313
01:47:27,405 --> 01:47:30,000
And what I predicted came to pass.

1314
01:47:32,377 --> 01:47:34,578
Congratulations, you're a prophet.

1315
01:47:34,991 --> 01:47:36,290
I'm a survivor.

1316
01:47:36,324 --> 01:47:38,742
Who wants to murder trillions.

1317
01:47:38,826 --> 01:47:42,758
With all six stones,
I could simply snap my fingers.

1318
01:47:43,053 --> 01:47:47,734
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

1319
01:47:49,791 --> 01:47:51,193
And then what?

1320
01:47:52,668 --> 01:47:58,039
I'd finally rest and watch the sun rise 
on a grateful universe.

1321
01:47:59,236 --> 01:48:02,758
The hardest choices
require the strongest wills.

1322
01:48:03,622 --> 01:48:08,461
I think you'll find our will
equal to yours.

1323
01:48:09,768 --> 01:48:10,769
Our?

1324
01:48:16,897 --> 01:48:18,363
Piece of cake, Quill.

1325
01:48:18,388 --> 01:48:20,617
Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.

1326
01:48:58,827 --> 01:49:00,193
Boom!

1327
01:49:01,047 --> 01:49:02,695
Don't let him close his fist.

1328
01:49:07,369 --> 01:49:08,370
Magic.

1329
01:49:08,938 --> 01:49:09,939
More magic.

1330
01:49:10,806 --> 01:49:11,807
Magic with a kick.

1331
01:49:12,219 --> 01:49:12,937
Magic with a-

1332
01:49:14,777 --> 01:49:15,727
Insect!

1333
01:49:53,350 --> 01:49:54,451
Well, well.

1334
01:49:54,623 --> 01:49:55,950
You should've killed me.

1335
01:49:55,952 --> 01:49:57,785
It would've been a waste of parts!

1336
01:50:03,265 --> 01:50:04,430
Where's Gamora?

1337
01:50:45,675 --> 01:50:46,967
Is he under? Don't let up.

1338
01:50:46,969 --> 01:50:49,580
Be quick. He is very strong.

1339
01:50:49,605 --> 01:50:51,972
Parker, help! Get over here.

1340
01:50:51,997 --> 01:50:54,167
She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

1341
01:50:59,589 --> 01:51:00,925
We gotta open his fingers to get it off.

1342
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:03,558
I thought you'd be hard to catch.
For the record, this was my plan.

1343
01:51:04,553 --> 01:51:06,322
You're not so strong now, huh?

1344
01:51:06,899 --> 01:51:08,566
Where is Gamora?

1345
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:10,867
My Gamora.

1346
01:51:10,892 --> 01:51:12,800
No, bullshit!

1347
01:51:13,107 --> 01:51:14,342
Where is she?

1348
01:51:15,464 --> 01:51:17,206
He is in anguish.

1349
01:51:17,466 --> 01:51:18,761
Good.

1350
01:51:19,597 --> 01:51:22,128
He... He mourns.

1351
01:51:22,438 --> 01:51:26,142
What does this monster have to mourn?

1352
01:51:27,048 --> 01:51:28,116
Gamora.

1353
01:51:31,833 --> 01:51:32,854
What?

1354
01:51:33,090 --> 01:51:34,800
He took her to Vormir.

1355
01:51:35,318 --> 01:51:37,286
He came back with the Soul Stone.

1356
01:51:38,072 --> 01:51:39,475
But she didn't.

1357
01:51:41,277 --> 01:51:45,026
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now.
You understand?

1358
01:51:45,494 --> 01:51:48,995
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

1359
01:51:50,430 --> 01:51:51,431
Tell me she's lying.

1360
01:51:53,636 --> 01:51:56,472
Asshole, tell me you didn't do it!

1361
01:51:58,040 --> 01:52:01,377
I had to.

1362
01:52:02,154 --> 01:52:03,362
No, you didn't.

1363
01:52:03,579 --> 01:52:05,198
No, you didn't.

1364
01:52:09,284 --> 01:52:10,684
- No, you didn't!
- Quill!

1365
01:52:10,686 --> 01:52:12,792
Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop!

1366
01:52:13,288 --> 01:52:14,498
Hey, stop! Stop!

1367
01:52:14,523 --> 01:52:15,815
It's coming, it's coming.
I got it, I got it!

1368
01:52:19,519 --> 01:52:20,628
Oh, God.

1369
01:53:19,354 --> 01:53:22,597
Come and get some, space dogs!

1370
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:28,471
Come on! Get some! Get some!

1371
01:53:28,496 --> 01:53:30,362
Come on! Get some!

1372
01:53:30,609 --> 01:53:31,866
How much for the gun?

1373
01:53:31,890 --> 01:53:33,065
Not for sale.

1374
01:53:33,368 --> 01:53:35,270
Okay. How much for the arm?

1375
01:53:37,054 --> 01:53:38,909
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1376
01:53:48,010 --> 01:53:49,144
New haircut?

1377
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:50,683
Noticed you've copied my beard.

1378
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:55,122
By the way, this is a friend of mine, Tree.

1379
01:53:55,704 --> 01:53:57,745
I am Groot.

1380
01:53:58,793 --> 01:54:00,331
I am Steve Rogers.

1381
01:54:20,336 --> 01:54:22,472
Fall back! Fall back, now!

1382
01:54:31,914 --> 01:54:34,148
Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.

1383
01:54:34,304 --> 01:54:35,405
I'm doing it.

1384
01:54:59,283 --> 01:55:00,984
Why was she up there all this time?

1385
01:55:01,745 --> 01:55:04,128
She's on the field. Take it.

1386
01:55:36,103 --> 01:55:38,253
Guys, we got a Vision situation here.

1387
01:55:41,109 --> 01:55:42,620
Somebody get to Vision!

1388
01:55:43,312 --> 01:55:44,311
I got him!

1389
01:55:44,319 --> 01:55:45,203
On my way.

1390
01:55:50,761 --> 01:55:53,456
He'll die alone. As will you.

1391
01:55:53,481 --> 01:55:54,800
She's not alone.

1392
01:56:21,177 --> 01:56:22,878
Oh, no, you don't.

1393
01:56:22,903 --> 01:56:24,603
This isn't gonna be like New York, pal.

1394
01:56:24,605 --> 01:56:26,839
This suit's already kicked the crap
outta the Hulk.

1395
01:56:27,173 --> 01:56:28,238
What? No! No!

1396
01:56:31,778 --> 01:56:34,548
Guys! Vision needs backup, now!

1397
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:38,089
Hulk? Hulk,

1398
01:56:38,114 --> 01:56:40,181
I know you like making your entrance
at the last second.

1399
01:56:40,206 --> 01:56:42,800
Well, this is it, man.
This is the last, last second.

1400
01:56:47,285 --> 01:56:48,972
Hulk! Hulk!

1401
01:56:49,645 --> 01:56:50,646
Hulk!

1402
01:56:51,819 --> 01:56:53,972
No!

1403
01:56:54,257 --> 01:56:58,471
Oh, screw you, you big, green asshole!
I'll do it myself!

1404
01:56:59,405 --> 01:57:01,112
Come on! Yeah!

1405
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:14,994
See ya!

1406
01:57:26,572 --> 01:57:29,042
Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.

1407
01:57:40,288 --> 01:57:42,253
I thought you were formidable, machine.

1408
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:45,516
But you're dying, like any man.

1409
01:57:54,136 --> 01:57:55,337
Get outta here!

1410
01:57:58,831 --> 01:57:59,865
Go!

1411
01:58:18,580 --> 01:58:20,131
That was really gross.

1412
01:58:47,456 --> 01:58:48,652
I thought I told you to go.

1413
01:58:49,948 --> 01:58:51,777
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1414
01:59:03,224 --> 01:59:05,089
I got you. I got you.

1415
01:59:05,663 --> 01:59:07,769
I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names.

1416
01:59:52,877 --> 01:59:54,544
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1417
01:59:56,548 --> 01:59:59,285
Yet you never once used
your greatest weapon.

1418
02:00:02,750 --> 02:00:03,815
A fake.

1419
02:00:11,796 --> 02:00:15,274
You throw another moon at me,
and I'm gonna lose it.

1420
02:00:15,649 --> 02:00:16,704
Stark.

1421
02:00:16,729 --> 02:00:17,797
You know me?

1422
02:00:18,465 --> 02:00:19,797
I do.

1423
02:00:19,922 --> 02:00:23,225
You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.

1424
02:00:24,053 --> 02:00:25,522
My only curse is you.

1425
02:00:28,047 --> 02:00:29,048
Come on!

1426
02:00:56,634 --> 02:00:58,845
All that for a drop of blood.

1427
02:01:43,022 --> 02:01:44,855
You have my respect, Stark.

1428
02:01:46,402 --> 02:01:49,572
When I'm done,
half of humanity will still be alive.

1429
02:01:55,166 --> 02:01:57,282
I hope they remember you.

1430
02:02:07,209 --> 02:02:08,243
Stop.

1431
02:02:14,618 --> 02:02:15,619
Spare his life...

1432
02:02:17,004 --> 02:02:18,806
...and I will give you the stone.

1433
02:02:22,544 --> 02:02:23,778
No tricks.

1434
02:02:28,546 --> 02:02:29,547
Don't.

1435
02:03:21,024 --> 02:03:22,673
One to go.

1436
02:03:32,717 --> 02:03:34,053
Where is he?

1437
02:03:43,106 --> 02:03:44,462
Did we just lose?

1438
02:03:48,345 --> 02:03:50,103
Why would you do that?

1439
02:03:53,631 --> 02:03:55,743
We're in the endgame now.

1440
02:04:21,649 --> 02:04:23,259
Are you okay?

1441
02:04:25,056 --> 02:04:26,985
What? What is it?

1442
02:04:29,080 --> 02:04:30,181
He's here.

1443
02:04:41,263 --> 02:04:44,157
Everyone, on my position. We have incoming.

1444
02:04:46,978 --> 02:04:48,946
What the hell?

1445
02:05:14,791 --> 02:05:15,792
Cap.

1446
02:05:16,149 --> 02:05:17,501
That's him.

1447
02:05:19,792 --> 02:05:22,261
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1448
02:05:46,962 --> 02:05:47,963
Wanda.

1449
02:05:49,041 --> 02:05:50,306
It's time.

1450
02:05:50,432 --> 02:05:51,501
No.

1451
02:05:51,534 --> 02:05:53,835
They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can.

1452
02:05:53,889 --> 02:05:55,188
Look at me.

1453
02:05:55,314 --> 02:05:56,913
You have the power to destroy the stone.

1454
02:05:56,938 --> 02:05:58,962
- Don't.
- You must do it. Wanda, please.

1455
02:06:01,094 --> 02:06:03,618
We are out of time.

1456
02:06:04,413 --> 02:06:05,720
I can't.

1457
02:06:05,745 --> 02:06:07,081
Yes, you can.

1458
02:06:07,783 --> 02:06:08,985
You can.

1459
02:06:10,519 --> 02:06:12,954
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.

1460
02:06:15,257 --> 02:06:16,798
It's not fair.

1461
02:06:18,027 --> 02:06:19,694
It shouldn't be you, but it is.

1462
02:06:21,463 --> 02:06:22,837
It's all right.

1463
02:06:24,366 --> 02:06:25,985
You could never hurt me.

1464
02:06:35,012 --> 02:06:36,686
I just feel you.

1465
02:08:00,128 --> 02:08:01,229
It's all right.

1466
02:08:11,172 --> 02:08:12,440
It's all right.

1467
02:08:16,811 --> 02:08:17,978
I love you.

1468
02:08:47,146 --> 02:08:49,124
I understand, my child.

1469
02:08:50,843 --> 02:08:52,444
Better than anyone.

1470
02:08:54,010 --> 02:08:55,945
You could never.

1471
02:09:00,951 --> 02:09:03,788
Today, I lost more than you can know.

1472
02:09:05,636 --> 02:09:08,155
But now is no time to mourn.

1473
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:14,403
Now is no time at all.

1474
02:09:37,978 --> 02:09:38,756
No!

1475
02:10:36,852 --> 02:10:38,311
I told you...

1476
02:10:39,649 --> 02:10:41,420
...you'd die for that.

1477
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:57,441
You should have...

1478
02:11:00,143 --> 02:11:01,512
You should...

1479
02:11:04,263 --> 02:11:07,428
You should have gone for the head.

1480
02:11:09,448 --> 02:11:10,449
No!

1481
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:44,941
Daughter?

1482
02:11:52,611 --> 02:11:54,072
Did you do it?

1483
02:11:55,939 --> 02:11:56,940
Yes.

1484
02:12:05,350 --> 02:12:06,923
What did it cost?

1485
02:12:10,589 --> 02:12:12,118
Everything.

1486
02:12:22,488 --> 02:12:24,123
What did you do?

1487
02:12:25,245 --> 02:12:26,646
What'd you do?

1488
02:12:40,321 --> 02:12:41,622
Where'd he go?

1489
02:12:44,903 --> 02:12:45,864
Thor.

1490
02:12:49,101 --> 02:12:50,559
Where'd he go?

1491
02:12:50,753 --> 02:12:51,715
Steve?

1492
02:13:26,885 --> 02:13:29,395
Up, General. Up!

1493
02:13:29,694 --> 02:13:31,293
This is no place to die.

1494
02:13:46,176 --> 02:13:47,709
I am Groot.

1495
02:13:47,796 --> 02:13:49,207
Oh...

1496
02:13:50,339 --> 02:13:52,408
No, no, no!

1497
02:13:53,370 --> 02:13:56,160
Groot! No.

1498
02:14:09,531 --> 02:14:10,665
Sam!

1499
02:14:14,766 --> 02:14:16,340
Sam, where you at?

1500
02:14:25,641 --> 02:14:27,810
Something's happening.

1501
02:14:40,025 --> 02:14:41,359
Quill?

1502
02:14:48,666 --> 02:14:49,869
Steady, Quill.

1503
02:14:49,894 --> 02:14:51,194
Oh, man.

1504
02:14:55,310 --> 02:14:56,311
Tony.

1505
02:14:59,779 --> 02:15:02,348
There was no other way.

1506
02:15:08,185 --> 02:15:09,135
Mr. Stark?

1507
02:15:13,413 --> 02:15:14,681
I don't feel so good.

1508
02:15:16,828 --> 02:15:17,727
You're all right.

1509
02:15:17,729 --> 02:15:19,029
I don't... I don't know what's happening.

1510
02:15:19,028 --> 02:15:19,970
I don't know...

1511
02:15:22,377 --> 02:15:25,424
I don't want to go.
I don't want to go, sir. Please.

1512
02:15:25,449 --> 02:15:28,218
Please, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

1513
02:15:32,710 --> 02:15:34,236
I'm sorry.

1514
02:15:48,993 --> 02:15:50,345
He did it.

1515
02:16:15,228 --> 02:16:18,385
What is this? What the hell is happening?

1516
02:16:35,424 --> 02:16:37,025
Oh, God.

1517
02:27:33,425 --> 02:27:35,025
Still no word from Stark?

1518
02:27:35,027 --> 02:27:36,358
No, not yet.

1519
02:27:36,360 --> 02:27:39,409
We're watching every satellite
on both hemispheres, but still nothing.

1520
02:27:40,315 --> 02:27:41,651
What is it?

1521
02:27:41,676 --> 02:27:44,112
Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.

1522
02:27:44,256 --> 02:27:46,323
Same energy signature as New York?

1523
02:27:46,348 --> 02:27:47,617
Ten times bigger.

1524
02:27:49,161 --> 02:27:50,284
Tell Klein we'll meet him at-

1525
02:27:50,309 --> 02:27:51,409
Nick! Nick!

1526
02:28:04,993 --> 02:28:06,228
They okay?

1527
02:28:07,253 --> 02:28:08,940
There's no one here.

1528
02:28:18,669 --> 02:28:20,120
Call Control.

1529
02:28:20,728 --> 02:28:21,962
Code red.

1530
02:28:22,841 --> 02:28:23,901
Nick.

1531
02:28:25,505 --> 02:28:26,506
Hill.

1532
02:28:41,526 --> 02:28:42,660
Oh, no.

1533
02:28:44,322 --> 02:28:45,323
Mother...
