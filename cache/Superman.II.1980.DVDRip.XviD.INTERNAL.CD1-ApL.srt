1
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:21,427
<i>Alert, alert, alert!</i>

2
00:01:53,963 --> 00:01:58,593
<i>You three criminals have been caught
in a further act of seditious treason.</i>

3
00:01:59,502 --> 00:02:03,529
<i>General Zod, your only feeling
was contempt for our society.</i>

4
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:06,506
<i>Your only desire was to command.</i>

5
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:11,813
<i>Ursa, the only feeling you showed
was for your vicious general.</i>

6
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:14,842
<i>Your only wish, to rule at his side.</i>

7
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:20,788
<i>Non, you are as without thought
as you are without voice.</i>

8
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:25,653
<i>This council has no hesitation
in proclaiming you...</i>

9
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,829
<i>... all guilty!</i>

10
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:30,126
<i>Guilty!</i>

11
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:02,295
<i>You will lie down before me, Jor-El.</i>

12
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:05,031
<i>Both you and them one day, Jor-El.</i>

13
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:06,924
<i>Jor-El!</i>

14
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:45,331
- Here, I'll just get the door for you.
- Yeah, thanks...

15
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:47,602
Sorry, after you.

16
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:53,940
- 'Morning, Phil.
- Excuse me, Kent.

17
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,556
Hi, Alice. That's a very pretty blouse
you're wearing today...

18
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,216
Catch you later, Clark.

19
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:08,053
Hello. I don't know. Okay...

20
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:10,131
- 'Morning, Louise.
- I'll check it.

21
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:15,827
Mr. White, how long should
the pressroom hold the front page?

22
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:18,305
Give it another 10 minutes. I'll tell him.

23
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:19,271
Thank you.

24
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,139
If we don't get anything new
in the next 10 minutes...

25
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:26,409
...go with the wire service copy under
the 40 point banner. Picture in 3 columns.

26
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:31,448
Kent, do a background story for the page
three sidebar on this terrorist group.

27
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,282
Right!

28
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,757
Sorry. Terrorists?

29
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:38,686
Get your heads out of the clouds.
Where have you been?

30
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:39,954
I was at home.

31
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:41,394
Don't you watch TV?

32
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,022
I don't enjoy TV, there's too much violence.
I was just reading Dickens.

33
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:48,399
Mr. Kent, a gang of terrorists
seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

34
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:51,904
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.
You do, don't you, Kent?

35
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:55,067
- Yes. Has anyone been hurt?
- So far the hostages are unharmed.

36
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:56,041
Hostages?

37
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:59,343
- Tourists, about 20 of them.
- That's just penny ante stuff.

38
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:02,043
If the French government
doesn't meet their demands...

39
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:04,382
...they've got a Hydrogen bomb
to level Paris.

40
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,583
Mr. White, that's terrible!

41
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,514
That's why they call them terrorists, Kent.

42
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,325
Get to the morgue. I want to know
everything there is on terrorism...

43
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:15,296
Does Lois know about this yet?

44
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:17,923
- Does she know about it? She's in it!
- She's what?

45
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,035
When the story broke,
I bundled her on the first Concorde.

46
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,237
If Paris might go kablooey,
I want my best reporter there.

47
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:25,205
But gee...

48
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:27,776
No offense. You're good,
but Lois Lane is better.

49
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,770
No, I meant,
isn't that a little bit dangerous, sir?

50
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:33,178
That goes with the territory, Kent.

51
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:37,313
Don't worry, if I know Lois Lane,
she'll not only come back...

52
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,355
...with a Pulitzer Prize story,
but a one-on-one interview...

53
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:43,392
...with the hydrogen bomb titled:
"What Makes Me Tick."

54
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,092
Now don't stand around, Kent...

55
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:17,459
<i>Merci, Merci.</i>

56
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:28,068
How did they get up there?

57
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:30,628
They were disguised as workers
to do repairs.

58
00:11:30,706 --> 00:11:33,140
Can you say why they released
the first hostages?

59
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:37,145
We insist they do this to show good faith.
If not, we refuse to negotiate.

60
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:39,181
Will they release the other hostages?

61
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,842
In return for a guarantee
that we will not launch an attack on them.

62
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,581
There will no be attack?
No attempt to overpower the terrorists?

63
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:48,952
- We've made this guarantee.
- You'll honor it?

64
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,054
We have not the choice to refuse.

65
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,595
If we believe it's a real
hydrogen bomb they have.

66
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:54,788
Where is the bomb?

67
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:56,456
It's in a big oil can.

68
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:59,000
A hydrogen bomb? Are you sure?

69
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:04,763
How can we be sure? Today it's possible
to make a bomb if you have the equipment.

70
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:07,535
<i>- This could blow up all of Paris.
- Oui.</i>

71
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,510
The position of your government?
Will they meet the demands?

72
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:13,047
I am not authorized
to say what they will do.

73
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:16,983
At this moment there is an emergency
meeting in the Elysée Palace.

74
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:19,377
<i>Non, ce n'est pas possible.</i>

75
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:24,152
<i>Excusez-moi? No. No comprende.
Moi, journaliste Americaine.</i>

76
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:26,921
<i>Non, non, c'est interdit!
Complètement interdit.</i>

77
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,554
<i>Attends. Wait.</i>

78
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,866
<i>- Voilà. Qu'est-ce que c'est le mot pour...
- Qu'est-ce que vous voulez?</i>

79
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:38,671
- Stairs. Stairs?
- Stairs...

80
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,105
S-T... S-T-A...

81
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:50,849
<i>Mademoiselle!</i>

82
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:04,094
We'll bring them down now.

83
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:04,962
Get in.

84
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,399
- Come on. Watch out for any tricks.
- Do we look like the sort...

85
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:11,269
I don't know what you look like.

86
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:13,507
You're being released, so shut up.

87
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,278
- Come on then, everybody out.
- Okay, we're ready.

88
00:13:57,653 --> 00:13:58,449
This way.

89
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:03,353
Come on. Quick.

90
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,026
Look, you're being released. Get moving.

91
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:09,288
I'll take a last look around.

92
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:17,230
Okay, send them down.

93
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:25,802
Up we go.

94
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:30,276
Pulitzer Prize.

95
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:34,613
Capital P...

96
00:14:51,507 --> 00:14:53,338
Should we have let the hostages go?

97
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:56,377
They'll give in to us
as soon as we plant the bomb.

98
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,673
It doesn't matter one way or the other.

99
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:04,082
Nobel Prize. Capital N...

100
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,811
...little o, little b...

101
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:09,117
...little e, little I.

102
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,556
Nobel. Nobel. Nobel, Nobel...

103
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:19,093
Prize!

104
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:27,000
Be careful.

105
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,602
It's me that controls the bomb,
not the bomb that controls me.

106
00:15:30,746 --> 00:15:33,408
I hope you have
not many sins left to be forgiven.

107
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:37,475
Because if you let go of that,
you'll have only 60 seconds to list them.

108
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:42,283
You are right. Do you hear something?

109
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:45,291
It sounded like
someone moving underneath.

110
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:46,587
It's your nerves.

111
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:51,092
Where are they now?

112
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,994
They are near to the lift.

113
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,965
One is still inside with the bomb.

114
00:15:57,072 --> 00:16:01,406
<i>Ils sont près de l'ascenseur. Y en a un
dedans avec la bombe. Il y en a un qui sort.</i>

115
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,435
The third one has come out of the lift now.

116
00:16:05,347 --> 00:16:06,814
<i>The third one is out now.</i>

117
00:16:06,915 --> 00:16:08,473
The bomb is still in there?

118
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,915
<i>Yes, we think so.</i>

119
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,748
This is the boring bit.

120
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,279
Tell them to get ready.

121
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:42,909
<i>Standby. Attention! Préparez-vous.</i>

122
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:45,879
Get ready.

123
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:47,819
Come on.

124
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:51,789
We'll cut the lead cable
when we get the word.

125
00:16:51,894 --> 00:16:54,192
Haven't they had time to find the bomb?

126
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:57,890
Of course not. They haven't.
We've been watching them all the time.

127
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,138
<i>Vas-y! Go. Now!</i>

128
00:17:19,822 --> 00:17:22,290
- It started!
- Oh, my God.

129
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:55,649
I believe this is your floor.

130
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,786
Thank God.

131
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:00,425
How did I get myself into this?

132
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,093
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

133
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:09,962
- A bomb! There's a bomb up there!
- I know.

134
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:41,318
Fresh melons here! Nice fresh melons...

135
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:50,827
Hi, Lois.

136
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,937
Hi, Clark.

137
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:04,917
Clark!

138
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:09,817
- Have you ever heard of crosswalks?
- Yeah, but you know, I mean...

139
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,157
Do you have any idea how stupid that was?

140
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:14,184
Freak!

141
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:19,463
Clark, you were lucky that time.

142
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:23,463
You must more careful. To cross
the street you've got to look both ways.

143
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:25,472
Lois, usually I do.

144
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:39,577
Maybe you ought to
get your glasses checked.

145
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,321
Not everybody can have
"x-ray vision," you know.

146
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:49,188
Do I detect a note of jealousy in that voice?

147
00:20:49,431 --> 00:20:52,366
Jealousy? No, not me.

148
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:57,037
Golly Lois, what are you doing?

149
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,868
When was the last time
you heard me sneeze?

150
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,666
You are never going to
hear me sneeze again!

151
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:07,072
I read this book,
and it says if you get 1,000 milligrams...

152
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:10,676
...of vitamin C every day,
you stay in perfect health.

153
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:13,721
Golly, 1,000?
That's certainly a lot of oranges, isn't it?

154
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:19,190
- There are pills, you know. I've seen them.
- Pills. That's the modern way to do things.

155
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,519
This is natural.

156
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:24,388
Besides, I get my exercise that way.

157
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:28,793
And Clark, you don't have to be jealous.

158
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:30,500
I don't?

159
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:33,134
No, you've got so much going for you.

160
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,509
I do?

161
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:37,477
Do you mind if I give you
a little constructive criticism?

162
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:41,140
- Actually, yes.
- Be more aggressive! You have to...

163
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,045
...go from the instinct. You see something,
you want it, you go for it!

164
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,178
That's what I do.

165
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:47,782
Yes, I've noticed.

166
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,591
- Perhaps I could help you there.
- Thanks, that would be great.

167
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:53,322
Let's see.

168
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:57,659
You put the orange in there.
That's very clever.

169
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:02,027
Clark...

170
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:08,242
...you know that I wouldn't say
all those things if I didn't really care.

171
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:11,771
You do?

172
00:22:14,116 --> 00:22:15,583
What else are friends for?

173
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:18,717
"Friends"?

174
00:22:23,158 --> 00:22:24,147
Here.

175
00:22:26,194 --> 00:22:27,593
Here's to friendship.

176
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,644
This is how it ends for
the greatest criminal mind of our time.

177
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:54,712
Not with a whimper. Not with a bang.

178
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,556
How do they choose
to reward Lex Luthor...

179
00:22:57,926 --> 00:22:59,860
...the greatest genius in this world?

180
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:04,022
Do they give him glory or treasure?
What, matter of fact, do they give him?

181
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:06,932
Life plus 25, Luthor. Get to work.

182
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,204
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor.
It almost worked.

183
00:23:15,343 --> 00:23:18,278
I mean, California almost
fell down right in the ocean.

184
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:20,211
Millions of people almost died.

185
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,409
If it hadn't been for Superman,
that overgrown Boy Scout...

186
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,544
I want my Liberace record back tonight.

187
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,555
What are you going to do
with a guy like that?

188
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,315
He flies around so fast and everything.

189
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:36,087
I mean they can't even trace
that guy on that radar they got.

190
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,494
Every time they try he just flies off.

191
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:40,932
- Where?
- North.

192
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,067
Why?

193
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:44,366
To ski?

194
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,339
Every man has his vulnerable point.

195
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,970
Some, like you Otis, have more than one.

196
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:53,342
I didn't see Superman's in time.

197
00:23:53,715 --> 00:23:56,445
But now through patience,
invention, and skill...

198
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:01,183
...my little black box is just about ready.

199
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:04,323
Oh! That little black box in our cell.

200
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:10,157
That little black box, Mr. Luthor.

201
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:13,056
What's it for?

202
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:18,399
That little black box
goes beyond any conventional radar.

203
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:21,339
It tracks alpha waves.

204
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,611
Alpha waves.

205
00:24:32,254 --> 00:24:36,156
Those alpha waves will take me north
to his secret.

206
00:24:38,193 --> 00:24:40,991
And his secret will give me Superman.

207
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:47,431
<i>The MAB is 196 at.5.</i>

208
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:49,866
<i>We ought to see the old beauty when we...</i>

209
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:55,975
You follow the bouncing ball for a while.
It's giving me a headache.

210
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,346
Anyway, somebody's got to check up
on those guys.

211
00:24:59,714 --> 00:25:01,807
Yeah, I keep forgetting about them.

212
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:04,844
How long they been up there, 45 days?

213
00:25:05,654 --> 00:25:07,588
The whole world's forgotten about us.

214
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:12,789
Houston calling Artemis II.

215
00:25:13,862 --> 00:25:15,830
Houston calling Artemis II, come in.

216
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:17,624
<i>'Morning, Houston.</i>

217
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,063
<i>Hold on, Nate.</i>

218
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:21,399
<i>- Yo!
- How are things going?</i>

219
00:25:22,504 --> 00:25:24,335
All systems normal, Houston.

220
00:25:24,873 --> 00:25:27,569
Andy is out doing the geological survey...

221
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:29,174
<i>More rocks.</i>

222
00:25:30,478 --> 00:25:33,242
And Cosmonaut Boris
is getting some soil samples.

223
00:25:33,815 --> 00:25:36,215
By the way, Boris and I are engaged.

224
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:39,844
I had a feeling about you guys
when I saw your Rorschach tests.

225
00:25:40,222 --> 00:25:42,486
Just a little détente humor there, Houston.

226
00:25:42,557 --> 00:25:44,388
<i>Surface conditions unchanged?</i>

227
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:47,355
It's mighty pretty out there. Mighty...

228
00:25:49,764 --> 00:25:50,594
...pretty.

229
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:53,030
<i>Mighty pretty, right.</i>

230
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:55,829
<i>Look, Nate...</i>

231
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,265
<i>Nate, wake up, will you?</i>

232
00:25:58,573 --> 00:26:00,564
That's it. I'm dreaming.

233
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:02,471
<i>Artemis, come in.</i>

234
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:07,511
Houston, we seem to have
an unidentified flying object.

235
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:09,148
Unidentified?

236
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:13,614
<i>- What does it look like?
- A lot like a...</i>

237
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:15,416
...like a girl.

238
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:37,507
You.

239
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,779
- What kind of a creature are you?
- Just a man.

240
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:44,575
A man?

241
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:47,213
<i>What's your name?
Where are you from?</i>

242
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:49,840
What a fragile sort of life form it is.

243
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:19,736
Houston, come in. Houston!

244
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:30,650
Come in, Houston.

245
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:35,524
Houston!

246
00:28:47,175 --> 00:28:48,233
Somebody help me!

247
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:56,950
- Artemis, this is Houston calling.
- What's up?

248
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,478
- Artemis, Houston calling. Come in please.
- What's going on?

249
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,588
- I don't know. We've lost contact.
- So?

250
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,518
I mean really.

251
00:29:07,595 --> 00:29:09,927
Artemis, come in please. Houston calling.

252
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:13,601
What was that he said before?
He saw a girl?

253
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:18,396
- I thought he said "curl."
- What's a "curl"?

254
00:29:18,807 --> 00:29:23,369
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used
to call a comet on an east-west trajectory?

255
00:29:23,445 --> 00:29:26,505
How should I know?
I was in back high school in those days.

256
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:31,650
Strange.
I tore those metal fibers like paper.

257
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:33,748
And what he did...

258
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:35,449
...was amazing!

259
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:40,191
- Something is happening.
- Yes. To all of us.

260
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:46,699
The closer we come
to an atmosphere with only one sun...

261
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:48,966
...a yellow sun...

262
00:29:49,671 --> 00:29:53,402
...the more our molecular density
gives us unlimited powers!

263
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:55,298
They come from there...

264
00:29:55,777 --> 00:29:57,404
...a place called Houston.

265
00:29:57,912 --> 00:29:59,641
Then we will go there too.

266
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:01,710
To rule.

267
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:04,708
Finally... to rule!

268
00:30:25,473 --> 00:30:26,735
380 out.

269
00:30:28,543 --> 00:30:29,805
381 out.

270
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:32,808
382 out.

271
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:35,444
383 out.

272
00:30:37,352 --> 00:30:38,614
384 out.

273
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,882
385 out.

274
00:30:46,494 --> 00:30:47,392
Lights out, Luthor.

275
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,863
I said, "Lights out!"

276
00:30:54,402 --> 00:30:57,633
You guys are about ten seconds away
from solitary, you know that?

277
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:01,768
I told you to...

278
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:21,885
Freeze, freeze!

279
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,610
Go out there and find it.

280
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:41,446
- What am I looking for?
- You'll know when you see it.

281
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:55,424
I think I found it.

282
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:02,968
What is it?

283
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:06,563
It's a ladder, you dummy.

284
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,306
Hi, Miss Teschmacher.

285
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:19,545
Come on.

286
00:32:20,388 --> 00:32:21,616
Hurry up.

287
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,114
Come on, hurry.

288
00:32:29,564 --> 00:32:31,828
Otis, hold that ladder, hurry up.

289
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,338
Come up.

290
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:48,113
Here I come, Mr. Luthor.

291
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:53,076
Otis, we're sinking!

292
00:32:53,154 --> 00:32:54,485
Get off, get off!

293
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:40,031
Excuse me.

294
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:44,604
If you'd like to carry Mrs...

295
00:33:45,173 --> 00:33:47,038
...Smith over the threshold...

296
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,133
- What?
- It's sort of traditional.

297
00:33:49,744 --> 00:33:52,304
I can give you a hand
if you have trouble lifting...

298
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,813
No. Of course not.

299
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:57,180
- Honey. Thanks, I'll walk.
- Certainly, dear.

300
00:33:59,654 --> 00:34:03,454
- Here you are.
- Sure is pink.

301
00:34:04,358 --> 00:34:06,087
Careful with the bags, please.

302
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,025
First visit to Honeymoon Haven?

303
00:34:08,096 --> 00:34:10,155
- Yes.
- Together, anyway.

304
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,131
Yes.

305
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,794
Let me just show you
some of our special features.

306
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:18,862
These are our "Flames of Love,"
exclusive with this motel in the area.

307
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:22,137
If you want the flames to go higher,
you just pull this.

308
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:23,308
I see.

309
00:34:23,711 --> 00:34:26,145
- Look dear, that's kind of romantic.
- In July?

310
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:28,845
Honey?

311
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:32,116
For a nominal charge,
our staff photographer will be happy...

312
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:35,917
...to prepare a special souvenir album
of your honeymoon stay.

313
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:39,458
He'll photograph you
in some of our more intimate locations...

314
00:34:39,527 --> 00:34:42,519
...in the "tub for two",
on the bear skin rug...

315
00:34:42,697 --> 00:34:44,494
Gee, real polyester!

316
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,758
And here's the bed.

317
00:34:47,034 --> 00:34:48,626
Right. Thank you.

318
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,167
Thank you, sir.

319
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,729
Of course.

320
00:34:55,977 --> 00:34:58,411
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir. And have a happy...

321
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,538
...whatever.

322
00:35:04,886 --> 00:35:06,251
Can you believe this?

323
00:35:06,788 --> 00:35:10,747
Posing as newlyweds to expose
a honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls!

324
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,520
What a waste of a great writer. Writers.

325
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,689
Perry White
and his Sunday magazine exposés.

326
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:23,168
How am I supposed to get a Pulitzer Prize
writing about a pink bear?

327
00:35:23,237 --> 00:35:25,899
I don't know,
I think this should be exposed.

328
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,498
They get kids who are just
starting out and take them for every cent.

329
00:35:29,577 --> 00:35:31,545
That's what Mr. White says.

330
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,411
On the other hand, this is kind of nice.
"Complimentary Champagne."

331
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:38,819
- Kissing contest tonight.
- Really?

332
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,548
Lois would... no.

333
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,214
Look at this.

334
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,949
Lois? Gee.

335
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,123
Look, I found a complimentary corsage.

336
00:35:51,265 --> 00:35:54,234
Everything's complimentary here
until you get the bill.

337
00:35:57,371 --> 00:35:59,362
Gee, you look very pretty.

338
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,772
- Thank you, Clark.
- Sure.

339
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:09,412
You know, Lois,
I was sort of thinking, later on...

340
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:14,946
...I was just wondering what you
wanted to do about the arrangements.

341
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:17,084
What arrangements, Clark?

342
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,391
I was thinking primarily about the...

343
00:36:23,397 --> 00:36:25,262
...the sleeping arrangements.

344
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:27,392
Mr. Smith...

345
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,261
...the complimentary couch.
- Right.

346
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,929
What?

347
00:36:38,846 --> 00:36:40,609
Gosh, it's alive.

348
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,815
Very good, Miss Teschmacher. Very good!

349
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:49,914
Why am I here? What am I doing here?

350
00:36:50,157 --> 00:36:53,558
Miss Teschmacher,
is this a philosophy seminar?

351
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:55,458
No.

352
00:36:55,529 --> 00:36:56,689
This is a getaway.

353
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:57,958
- Getaway?
- Right.

354
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:00,629
Lex, how could you do that to Otis?

355
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:02,597
What else is ballast for?

356
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:04,632
Miss Teschmacher...

357
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:07,873
...north. Due north.

358
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,570
Right, north.

359
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:34,960
- Where's Jimmy Olsen when I need him?
- Isn't it beautiful?

360
00:37:35,236 --> 00:37:37,397
Just gorgeous. Gorgeous.

361
00:37:38,272 --> 00:37:39,569
- Lois?
- Yes?

362
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:44,168
Everybody's holding hands.
Maybe we should hold hands, too?

363
00:37:44,712 --> 00:37:46,873
- Here's my hand Clark, hold it.
- Thanks.

364
00:37:48,649 --> 00:37:51,277
You know what? They're afraid to let go.

365
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:54,319
- Why?
- If they let go, straight to the lawyer.

366
00:37:54,488 --> 00:37:57,389
I don't know about that.
They look kind of happy to me.

367
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:58,755
Because you're blind.

368
00:38:00,227 --> 00:38:01,216
Yeah.

369
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:03,524
- Here.
- No, I've got it.

370
00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:07,396
You've got to look after yourself.
You've only got one pair of eyes.

371
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:09,069
Lois...

372
00:38:09,236 --> 00:38:10,134
Here.

373
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,365
- Right.
- Don't say I never did anything...

374
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,407
Thank you.

375
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,610
Son! Excuse me, please.

376
00:38:19,013 --> 00:38:20,002
Be careful!

377
00:38:20,081 --> 00:38:22,015
Get down. Get down!

378
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:28,147
You're embarrassing me
in front of everybody.

379
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:34,018
Did you see what almost happened there?
That little boy...

380
00:38:36,297 --> 00:38:38,162
I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

381
00:38:38,532 --> 00:38:40,932
- Lois, you're amazing.
- Because I'm hungry?

382
00:38:41,168 --> 00:38:44,968
No, I mean here you stand with one
of nature's most awesome spectacles...

383
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:47,940
...and you're thinking about food.
Aren't you impressed?

384
00:38:48,642 --> 00:38:53,545
Once a girl's seen Superman in action,
Niagara Falls kind of leaves you cold.

385
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:55,672
- You know what I mean?
- Him again?

386
00:38:57,318 --> 00:38:58,444
I'm sorry.

387
00:38:59,186 --> 00:39:01,120
I have a one-track mind, don't I?

388
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,722
My one track mind's
telling me that I'm hungry.

389
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:06,623
- Hot dog?
- Hot dog.

390
00:39:07,561 --> 00:39:11,224
- Could I have some orange juice?
- Freshly squeezed, I know.

391
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:19,931
Mom, look!

392
00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:22,567
Yeah, honey, that's nice.

393
00:39:32,987 --> 00:39:33,954
Oh, my God!

394
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,354
Help!

395
00:39:40,227 --> 00:39:41,387
Somebody help!

396
00:39:57,378 --> 00:39:59,141
Way to go, Superman!

397
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:06,682
What a nice man!

398
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:23,035
- There you go.
- Again! Again!

399
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,761
I'm sorry. Only one ride to a customer.

400
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:29,940
Superman! Superman, it's me, Lois!

401
00:40:30,711 --> 00:40:33,703
Come here. You're going to get it!
Give me a heart attack...

402
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:37,717
It's me. It's Lois. Lois Lane.

403
00:40:40,254 --> 00:40:41,585
Hello and goodbye.

404
00:40:42,223 --> 00:40:45,750
What's the hurry, seeing as you
happen to be in Niagara Falls?

405
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:50,121
Happen to be in Niagara Falls...

406
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:52,532
And, Clark...

407
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:56,100
Clark is not around as usual.

408
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,814
Lois?

409
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,381
- Here you go.
- Where were you?

410
00:41:18,826 --> 00:41:21,124
I was getting hot dogs.
What do you mean?

411
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:26,061
It just seems kind of strange to me
that every time Superman's around, you...

412
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,359
...disappear.

413
00:41:27,635 --> 00:41:30,536
Superman? You mean he was here?
Golly!

414
00:41:31,305 --> 00:41:33,569
And you weren't. As usual.

415
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:39,068
- What have you got to say about that?
- Darn, I forgot your orange juice.

416
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,474
Clark!

417
00:41:42,316 --> 00:41:43,408
No orange juice?

418
00:41:53,794 --> 00:41:57,127
- Mush! Mush!
- I am mushing.

419
00:41:57,731 --> 00:42:00,791
Ice and snow:
Is this your idea of a good time?

420
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:05,697
A good time? Is that all you care about?
North, Miss Teschmacher.

421
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,768
North!

422
00:42:09,076 --> 00:42:10,600
Yes, Lex, north.

423
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:14,342
Look. It's his home.
It's Superman's home.

424
00:42:14,815 --> 00:42:16,476
Good, more ice.

425
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,523
- Fantastic!
- Fantastic.

426
00:42:25,326 --> 00:42:27,556
It's fantastic!

427
00:42:30,598 --> 00:42:34,329
The construction goes far beyond
any known architectural theory.

428
00:42:35,336 --> 00:42:37,429
- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

429
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:49,778
- This place is genius!
- Genius.

430
00:42:53,687 --> 00:42:55,655
- Lex!
- I'll be all right.

431
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,017
No, me.

432
00:43:00,394 --> 00:43:01,986
Why can't you be more careful?

433
00:43:04,531 --> 00:43:06,396
- This is beautiful.
- Beautiful.

434
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,127
- It has everything.
- Wrong.

435
00:43:10,271 --> 00:43:13,900
- Why didn't you go before we left?
- That was two days ago.

436
00:43:20,914 --> 00:43:23,382
This looks like some kind of control panel.

437
00:43:27,488 --> 00:43:29,854
- Don't touch anything.
- Don't touch anything.

438
00:43:31,325 --> 00:43:34,158
- Ice.
- I said don't touch it.

439
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,561
- It's not ice.
- It looks like a crystal.

440
00:43:44,505 --> 00:43:49,499
<i>Kryptonian memory bank,
education crystal #308.</i>

441
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,104
- I told you it was a crystal.
- Shut up!

442
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,245
<i>Earth culture, Section B.</i>

443
00:43:56,216 --> 00:44:00,084
<i>"Trees" by Joyce Kilmer,
of the Planet Earth.</i>

444
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:01,851
What?

445
00:44:02,122 --> 00:44:06,456
<i>"I think that I shall never see
a poem lovely as a tree...</i>

446
00:44:08,162 --> 00:44:12,565
He's not here. It's a voice from the past.
That's cute. That's very cute.

447
00:44:13,634 --> 00:44:15,898
<i>"...a tree that looks at God all day"...</i>

448
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,204
I like trees!

449
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:21,871
So does your average cocker spaniel.
Give me another one.

450
00:44:22,509 --> 00:44:24,500
No. The big one there.

451
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:35,813
<i>Kal-El, my son...</i>

452
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:38,988
<i>... as the Keeper
of the Archives of Krypton...</i>

453
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:43,120
<i>... it falls to me to tell you of the darkest
episode in our planet's history.</i>

454
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,029
Now this I want to hear.

455
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:48,933
<i>After many eons of harmony, there
appeared among us three rebel elements...</i>

456
00:44:49,002 --> 00:44:51,334
<i>... what you would call on Earth,
"criminals."</i>

457
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:53,532
Criminals? My kind of people.

458
00:44:53,974 --> 00:44:59,002
<i>Despite all our efforts, we were unable to
change their evil natures, their evil ways.</i>

<i>As you know, we hath no death penalty.</i>

460
00:45:01,715 --> 00:45:02,807
Sensible enough.

461
00:45:02,883 --> 00:45:05,044
<i>Therefore, our scientists constructed...</i>

462
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,348
<i>..."The Phantom Zone".</i>

00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:11,218

00:45:11,825 --> 00:45:14,555
<i>... imprisoning them there for all eternity.</i>

465
00:45:15,095 --> 00:45:16,960
No possibility for parole?

466
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:20,865
<i>Your father, Jor-El,
thought long and hard upon that question.</i>

467
00:45:21,769 --> 00:45:23,236
I asked the right question.

468
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,795
<i>There is one danger.
The Phantom Zone might...</i>

469

<i>... just might, be cracked

<i>I wish you hadn't asked me that...</i>

471
00:45:36,683 --> 00:45:37,980
I didn't ask anything.

472
00:45:38,051 --> 00:45:41,248
<i>We do not know
what would happen if they were to escape.</i>

00:45:51,098 --> 00:45:52,156
<i>... that you have.</i>

476
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,789
Think of it.

477
00:45:53,901 --> 00:45:55,368
<i>- The first of the three...
- Three.</i>

478
00:45:55,436 --> 00:45:58,963
<i>...is their leader, General Zod.
- Count them, three super-villains.</i>

479
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,169
<i>- Together with Non and Ursa...
- Each one with the same power he has.</i>

480
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:07,407
Each one totally dedicated to corruption,
violence, and evil.

481
00:46:07,614 --> 00:46:11,812
Wait. That explains the three Alpha Waves
I've been getting on my black box.

482
00:46:12,252 --> 00:46:13,913
They'll need a contact here on Earth.

483
00:46:13,987 --> 00:46:17,787
Someone with the same contempt for life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

484
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,189
South, Miss Teschmacher!

485
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,652
You know, it's really amazing.

486
00:46:21,728 --> 00:46:25,596
I never started to put it together
before now. It's just kind of funny...

487
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:28,601
...because a good reporter
can't let anything slip by her.

488
00:46:28,669 --> 00:46:32,400
- Of course not.
- I'm beginning to get the picture.

489
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:38,144
As usual, Lois, I really don't know
what you're talking about.

490
00:46:39,446 --> 00:46:42,074
Tell you what,
I'll meet you back at the hotel.

491
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:43,907
What's your hurry, Superman?

492
00:46:47,621 --> 00:46:48,519
Sorry?

493
00:46:51,492 --> 00:46:54,984
I've got to admit, your disguise is
nearly perfect. You had me fooled.

494
00:46:55,362 --> 00:46:57,557
And I am nobody's fool, believe me.

495
00:46:57,798 --> 00:46:59,163
No, of course not.

496
00:46:59,266 --> 00:47:02,861
You just have an active imagination.
You get carried away sometimes.

497
00:47:02,936 --> 00:47:05,461
- I understand. It can happen to anybody.
- Listen...

498
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,404
...I'm so sure that you're Superman
that I'm willing to bet my life on it.

499
00:47:10,944 --> 00:47:11,774
What?

500
00:47:13,447 --> 00:47:15,779
If I'm right, you'll turn into Superman.

501
00:47:17,017 --> 00:47:18,678
If I'm wrong...

502
00:47:19,186 --> 00:47:21,780
...you've got yourself one hell of a story.

503
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:26,152
You think I'm Superman?

504
00:47:26,727 --> 00:47:28,888
Boy, you certainly have some imagination.

505
00:47:29,062 --> 00:47:31,860
For a minute, you almost
had me convinced. For a minute.

506
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,866
Bye-bye, baby.

507
00:47:38,705 --> 00:47:39,865
Oh, my god!

508
00:47:43,877 --> 00:47:45,242
Excuse me, please.

509
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:46,412
Help!

510
00:47:56,823 --> 00:47:58,450
Superman!

511
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,459
Lois, swim!

512
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,722
Help!

513
00:48:05,899 --> 00:48:08,231
Look out for the rocks! Oh, God!

514
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:10,796
Clark!

515
00:48:35,596 --> 00:48:37,655
- Grab that branch!
- What?

516
00:48:44,605 --> 00:48:45,799
Help!

517
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,216
Lois, you all right?

518
00:49:18,572 --> 00:49:20,164
Here!

519
00:49:33,086 --> 00:49:36,681
- You were what I thought was Superman?
- Sorry.

520
00:49:37,924 --> 00:49:40,017
This is really embarrassing.

521
00:50:09,322 --> 00:50:11,347
So this is planet Houston?

522
00:50:14,795 --> 00:50:16,820
A very strange surface.

523
00:51:01,174 --> 00:51:03,404
A primitive sort of life form.

524
00:51:14,354 --> 00:51:15,787
Did you see that?

525
00:51:17,124 --> 00:51:18,523
Did you see what I did?

526
00:51:19,526 --> 00:51:21,926
I have powers beyond reason here.

527
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:24,492
We all have them, my dear.

528
00:51:45,152 --> 00:51:47,712
I must've looked like an idiot...

529
00:51:48,155 --> 00:51:50,953
...jumping in the river,
waiting for Mr. Wonderful...

530
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,323
...who obviously had better things to do.

531
00:51:56,096 --> 00:51:59,122
I'm sure it must've been
something very important, Lois.

532
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,592
And then thinking you were...

533
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:05,970
If Perry White could see me now...

534
00:52:10,343 --> 00:52:11,640
Where's my comb?

535
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:19,113
God, not only have I lost my mind,
I lost my comb.

536
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,980
Can you pass me that brush over there?

537
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,211
Sure.

538
00:52:33,633 --> 00:52:36,830
- No. It's okay.
- Let me see your hand. Give it to me.

539
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,235
- No. It's all right, Lois.
- Let me look at it.

540
00:52:51,017 --> 00:52:54,214
- You are Superman.
- Come on, don't be silly.

541
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:16,664
I'm sorry.

542
00:53:18,144 --> 00:53:20,635
No, you don't have anything
to be sorry about.

543
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,875
I don't know why I did that.

544
00:53:26,853 --> 00:53:28,081
Maybe you wanted to.

545
00:53:29,322 --> 00:53:30,516
I don't think I did.

546
00:53:32,926 --> 00:53:37,920
Maybe you didn't want to with your mind,
but maybe you wanted to with your heart.

547
00:53:43,203 --> 00:53:44,363
We'd better talk.

548
00:53:50,844 --> 00:53:52,209
I'm in love with you.

549
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:57,508
We really better talk.

550
00:53:59,753 --> 00:54:00,811
I'm listening.

551
00:54:02,355 --> 00:54:06,189
We can't talk here. Perry will call
at about 6:00 to find out what's happening.

552
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,323
"What's happening"?
That's the understatement of the year.

553
00:54:15,936 --> 00:54:18,769
Where do you want to... talk?

554
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:26,834
Lois...

555
00:54:30,116 --> 00:54:32,914
...now that you know,
I think you should know it all.

556
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,812
I want to.

557
00:54:37,123 --> 00:54:38,351
Let's go to my place.

558
00:54:42,062 --> 00:54:43,757
Maybe I should change first.

559
00:54:49,602 --> 00:54:51,092
Maybe you should, too.

560
00:55:19,332 --> 00:55:22,859
- They have a wide selection.
- I can't eat fish.

561
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:27,165
You can eat anything you want, Duane.
You can eat meat and potatoes.

562
00:55:27,607 --> 00:55:30,405
I couldn't go anywhere
where I was expected to eat fish.

563
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:32,034
They got beans.

564
00:55:32,545 --> 00:55:35,844
I can't eat beans.
I come out in a rash if I eat beans.

565
00:55:35,949 --> 00:55:40,613
Look, Duane, they have a wide selection.

566
00:55:42,522 --> 00:55:44,387
I think I'll try the fish.

567
00:55:51,531 --> 00:55:55,831
I don't know, from the look of them,
I'll bet $10 they're from Los Angeles.

568
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:04,270
Hey, hippies! Get your butts off the road!

569
00:56:05,378 --> 00:56:08,438
I like the globe that flashes red
like our Krypton sun.

570
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,041
But not this irritating noise.

571
00:56:11,751 --> 00:56:12,649
Make way!

572
00:56:14,554 --> 00:56:18,149
Did I hear right?
Did that son of a bitch give me an order?

573
00:56:18,725 --> 00:56:20,693
Duane, you take care of it.

574
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,818
But...

575
00:56:22,095 --> 00:56:25,360
You got to learn to kick ass
if you want to be a peacemaker.

576
00:56:33,706 --> 00:56:37,472
All right. Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing here?

577
00:56:38,078 --> 00:56:41,707
What is this symbol?
Do you follow another leader?

578
00:56:42,282 --> 00:56:43,681
Follow the leader?

579
00:56:45,585 --> 00:56:47,348
Holy skunk sweat!

580
00:56:48,254 --> 00:56:50,415
- All right.
- A weapon of some sort?

581
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,565
How in the hell did you do that?

582
00:57:10,276 --> 00:57:11,607
Jesus H. Christ!

583
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,174
Crude noise-maker.

584
00:57:31,498 --> 00:57:33,056
Just checking the tire...

585
00:58:37,964 --> 00:58:40,489
- Wow, this is your home!
- No.

586
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:44,100
Actually, I live in the city,
about three blocks from you.

587
00:58:45,972 --> 00:58:48,270
This is a very special place for me.

588
00:58:48,641 --> 00:58:50,040
I wanted you to see it.

589
00:58:51,211 --> 00:58:52,769
Listen, you warm enough?
