1
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,577
Skyler, I'm so....

2
00:00:37,785 --> 00:00:41,581
Marie. Oh, Christ, Marie. How...?

3
00:00:43,124 --> 00:00:46,335
Oh, God. Oh, thank God.

4
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:48,796
Is she beautiful?

5
00:00:51,257 --> 00:00:56,596
Yeah, I'm staring at brake lights
on the 40.

6
00:00:56,804 --> 00:00:58,389
Some accident up ahead.

7
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,517
Christ! Today of all days, huh?

8
00:01:01,726 --> 00:01:06,689
No, no, no. Let her rest.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

9
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:08,774
Thank you.

10
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,625
Excuse me. Skyler White?

11
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:28,294
-307.
-Thank you.

12
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:42,099
Skyler, I'm so sorry. I'm just....

13
00:01:42,308 --> 00:01:43,976
Are you okay?

14
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:49,482
Meet your daughter.

15
00:02:00,326 --> 00:02:03,996
Hi there, girl. Hi there, Holly.

16
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:06,165
Congratulations, Walt.

17
00:02:08,376 --> 00:02:12,171
Oh, Ted, I'm sorry,
I didn't see you here.

18
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,966
Oh, Ted drove me here. Thank God.

19
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:19,720
I mean, this little bundle of joy
of ours was practically on rails.

20
00:02:19,929 --> 00:02:22,473
Halfway here I thought
he was gonna have to pull over...

21
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:24,517
...and deliver her himself.

22
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:30,690
Well, that--
I'm glad it didn't come to that.

23
00:02:31,732 --> 00:02:32,775
Yeah. Thanks, Ted.

24
00:02:33,442 --> 00:02:35,319
No problem at all.

25
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:38,322
Well, let me get out of your way here
so you two can--

26
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:41,492
You three can be alone, okay?

27
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:44,328
Listen, take it easy, Sky.

28
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:48,207
-I really can't begin to thank you.
-Don't think anything of it.

29
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,376
It's my pleasure.
Congratulations again.

30
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:52,003
-Thank you.
-She's beautiful.

31
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:53,713
Okay. I'll talk to you soon.

32
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:55,214
Okay. Take care.

33
00:02:55,423 --> 00:02:56,674
Bye.

34
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,727
Are you okay?

35
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:09,770
-Is everything okay?
-Everything is okay.

36
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:13,399
I just wish you'd been here.

37
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:19,572
-Where's everyone else?
-Downstairs.

38
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,449
Hank and Marie
took Junior for dinner.

39
00:03:21,657 --> 00:03:25,870
He has been such a trouper.
He even changed his first diaper.

40
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:27,997
-No.
-Yeah.

41
00:03:30,082 --> 00:03:31,584
Did he?

42
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:36,505
Honey, is there anything
that I can do for you?

43
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:39,050
-Anything at all?
-Actually, yes.

44
00:03:39,258 --> 00:03:41,844
I left my overnight bag
at home this morning.

45
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:44,764
I just think you get it in your head,
C-section. You know?

46
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:48,768
But I'm just so glad,
the way it all worked out.

47
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:51,312
Doing it natural instead.

48
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,773
It just couldn't have gone any better.

49
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:55,483
Good.

50
00:03:58,611 --> 00:04:02,949
Let me go get your things.

51
00:04:03,824 --> 00:04:07,537
And I'll get my stuff too, okay?

52
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:09,288
-I'll spend the night.
-Okay.

53
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:45,635
Dad.

54
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:48,471
I was in the shower, hey.

55
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:51,557
I overslept.

56
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,519
I'm running late, but I'll be there.

57
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,271
Yeah.

58
00:06:02,818 --> 00:06:04,654
Baby, I gotta go.

59
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:08,157
Okay.

60
00:06:22,797 --> 00:06:24,507
Somebody broke in.

61
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:26,300
Okay.

62
00:06:43,234 --> 00:06:45,278
Oh, no. No, no, no!

63
00:06:46,237 --> 00:06:47,822
Come on.

64
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:49,907
Damn.

65
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,328
Oh, God.

66
00:06:55,663 --> 00:06:57,623
Oh, Christ.

67
00:07:02,587 --> 00:07:03,921
This week was tough.

68
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,548
Toughest yet.

69
00:07:05,756 --> 00:07:08,926
You know why?
I knew this day was coming.

70
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:11,512
-My birthday.
-Your re-birthday?

71
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:13,723
Yeah. As it got closer, it got worse.

72
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:15,766
I was scared shitless
I wouldn't make it.

73
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:17,393
I really didn't think I would.

74
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:19,937
Called in sick three days in a row.

75
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:22,106
I know my boss was pissed.

76
00:07:22,315 --> 00:07:25,318
I guess I don't really care.
I just didn't wanna see anybody.

77
00:07:25,526 --> 00:07:26,652
You guys know how that is.

78
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:28,779
All it would take is one friend...

79
00:07:28,988 --> 00:07:31,657
...and I'd be out
ripping and running again.

80
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:33,993
But I made it. I really made it.

81
00:07:34,202 --> 00:07:37,163
I got one year clean to the day.

82
00:07:59,393 --> 00:08:01,854
You look tired.
Your eyes are kind of red.

83
00:08:02,063 --> 00:08:05,149
-You getting enough sleep?
-Actually, no.

84
00:08:05,691 --> 00:08:08,861
I'm working on this
really complex new tat.

85
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,530
-Yeah?
-A guy wants his whole back done up.

86
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:14,325
Him on his chopper with, like,
flames all around.

87
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:17,995
I keep showing him the design,
he keeps asking for changes, like:

88
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:20,206
"Give me more muscles.
Give me more flames."

89
00:08:20,414 --> 00:08:23,376
And I'm like, "A:
This ain't the Sistine Chapel.

90
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:27,797
And B: I have enough trouble
working around your zits."

91
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,466
I really wish you wouldn't
work at that place.

92
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:32,552
You need to avoid
those type of people.

93
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,721
I know and I do.

94
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:40,184
It's mostly college kids
and airmen from Kirtland.

95
00:08:40,393 --> 00:08:42,228
It's actually really corporate.

96
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:45,314
Thank you.

97
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:52,154
So how's your job?

98
00:08:52,363 --> 00:08:54,240
Oh, you know. Same old, same old.

99
00:08:54,448 --> 00:08:56,742
Doing backup training
on my days off.

100
00:08:56,951 --> 00:09:00,746
God, they're hiring anybody now.
I mean, no experience at all. It's scary.

101
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:08,337
You seeing anyone?

102
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:12,008
No.

103
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:13,384
You?

104
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:16,178
What about that guy next door?

105
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:17,722
What do you mean?

106
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,266
Well, he seemed to have
some expectation...

107
00:09:20,474 --> 00:09:22,059
...of you introducing me to him.

108
00:09:22,268 --> 00:09:24,353
He knows you own the place.

109
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:26,188
Yeah.

110
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:27,732
Dad, he's our tenant.

111
00:09:28,482 --> 00:09:29,775
End of story.

112
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:31,903
Why would I get involved
with a tenant?

113
00:09:33,988 --> 00:09:35,031
Okay.

114
00:09:36,157 --> 00:09:37,783
There you go.

115
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:49,128
Oh, yes.

116
00:09:49,337 --> 00:09:51,422
Oh, isn't she beautiful?

117
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:54,133
I just think she's the most
beautiful baby ever.

118
00:09:54,342 --> 00:09:56,719
Yeah. And why not?

119
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:58,679
Good stock.

120
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,142
I'll get it.

121
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:04,644
Yeah. Yeah.

122
00:10:04,852 --> 00:10:07,647
Hello. Hello?

123
00:10:09,232 --> 00:10:11,025
Nobody's there.

124
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:12,818
Oh, well.

125
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:16,614
Beat you.

126
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:19,158
-Hello.
-Hey, man.

127
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:20,826
<i>Oh, hi, Carmen.</i>

128
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:22,578
Just Carmen.

129
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:26,415
-Come on. Hurry up.
-So you heard, huh? Yes, yes.

130
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:29,001
<i>Good news.
Oh, she's just so beautiful.</i>

131
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:31,587
Well, Holly.

132
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:33,631
<i>Seven pounds, 3 ounces.</i>

133
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,384
Everybody is doing just fine.

134
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:39,345
You junkie imbecile.
What are you calling this number for?

135
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:41,681
I am trying to tell you, man.

136
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:44,809
Last night,
somebody broke in my place, yo.

137
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:46,477
<i>-I got robbed.
-What?</i>

138
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:51,190
Yeah. Somebody,
they got all of our stuff. Okay?

139
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,109
All of it.

140
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:57,321
You get me, Mr. White?

141
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,615
<i>The blue stuff. It's, like, uncanny.</i>

142
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:02,034
They knew exactly where to look.

143
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:05,872
I mean, say something, man, all right?
Yell at me or something! Come on!

144
00:11:06,706 --> 00:11:08,374
<i>Mr. White.</i>

145
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:12,003
God!

146
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,672
Oh, no.

147
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:20,887
Okay. Okay. Okay.

148
00:11:27,518 --> 00:11:30,187
Hank, come on.
People are starving to death out here.

149
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:32,440
All right. I just had to get a beer.

150
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:34,191
Finally.

151
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,985
All right, guys. Here we go.

152
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:39,989
<i>We got mild, medium
and muy caliente.</i>

153
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:42,408
I got dibs on the breast.

154
00:11:42,617 --> 00:11:45,745
-Los Pollos Hermanos?
-Oh, yeah, seriously. You gotta try it.

155
00:11:45,953 --> 00:11:49,248
I think this joint gives KFC
a run for their money.

156
00:11:49,665 --> 00:11:51,500
That baby is hungry.

157
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,085
Give me that baby.

158
00:11:53,294 --> 00:11:55,421
Oh, sweetie, yes.

159
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,256
Do you have any coleslaw in there?

160
00:11:57,465 --> 00:11:59,091
Oh, no, no, no. Come on. Jeez, Sky.

161
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:03,596
-Not at the table. We're eating.
-Hank, it's only a breast.

162
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:06,891
-It's my sister-in-law's breast.
-Oh, you are so provincial.

163
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:09,518
Hank, remember the day...

164
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:12,021
...when you were talking to me
about childproofing?

165
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,272
Yeah.

166
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:15,942
Yeah, yeah. What are you thinking?
A fence or a cover?

167
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,904
Yeah. No, well, actually, I was
thinking more of an alarm system.

168
00:12:20,112 --> 00:12:24,075
They've got these new systems that
are now sonar systems that would--

169
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:26,494
Anything falls into it,
it sets the alarm off.

170
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:27,703
Oh, nice.

171
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:30,748
-Wow, that sounds expensive.
-Well, yeah.

172
00:12:30,957 --> 00:12:35,628
-But for the baby, I mean....
-Well, why don't....

173
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:38,798
Why don't you let Marie and I
get that for you?

174
00:12:39,006 --> 00:12:41,425
-Absolutely.
-No, no. Thank you.

175
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:44,136
No, no, please.
I'll be back at work soon.

176
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:46,013
We'll take care of it.

177
00:12:46,222 --> 00:12:48,099
Back at work soon?

178
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:50,851
Since you're scheduled
for surgery...

179
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,314
...I just thought it might be a good
idea to have some money coming in.

180
00:12:56,941 --> 00:13:02,029
Well, Skyler, we need to think
about what's best for the baby.

181
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:06,325
And I think having her mother around
for at least the first few years....

182
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:11,581
Money-wise, we'll manage.
I promise you that.

183
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:15,418
What? You guys got, like, a printing
press in the garage churning out 50s?

184
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:16,669
I wish.

185
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:18,880
Mom's even talking
about me getting a job.

186
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:22,675
That's right. Everybody pitches in.

187
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:26,137
Why don't we ever get Chinese?

188
00:13:33,811 --> 00:13:35,438
I'll get her.

189
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:37,690
I'll get her.

190
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:49,535
Yes. Good girl.

191
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:52,079
That's a good girl.

192
00:13:52,288 --> 00:13:54,540
My little girl, huh?

193
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:09,972
Hey, do you wanna see something?

194
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:12,850
Come here.

195
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:15,853
Oh, I know, I know.

196
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:21,901
Yeah.

197
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,076
Hey.

198
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:33,913
You wanna see what
your daddy did for you?

199
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:37,917
Let me show you.

200
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,962
Here. Come here.

201
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:45,049
Wanna see?

202
00:14:58,104 --> 00:15:02,316
That's right. Daddy did that.

203
00:15:08,322 --> 00:15:10,658
Daddy did that for you.

204
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:24,630
This place looks exactly the same.

205
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,175
Why don't you have computers
and shit? It's the 20th century.

206
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:29,886
What the hell are you doing here?

207
00:15:30,094 --> 00:15:32,096
-Get out.
-No. You took the stash.

208
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:34,265
I heard all those messages,
figured it out.

209
00:15:34,473 --> 00:15:37,435
You figured it out, huh?
Well, congratulations, Einstein.

210
00:15:37,643 --> 00:15:41,397
You left me to freak out all day long
like I dropped the ball or something...

211
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:45,151
-...and you were the one who took it!
-Shut up.

212
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:47,987
You lower your voice.

213
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,827
"Like you dropped the ball"?

214
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:58,789
When have you ever
not dropped the ball, Jesse?

215
00:15:58,998 --> 00:16:01,500
Blasted out of your mind
on whatever the hell that was.

216
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:04,921
What was that, heroin?

217
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:07,965
Jesus.

218
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:10,843
I was on my day off, man.
What I do on my day off--

219
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:13,346
"Day off"?
We were on call, you junkie.

220
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:15,640
On call for the biggest deal
of our lives.

221
00:16:15,848 --> 00:16:19,227
I just managed to pull it off by the
skin of my teeth, no thanks to you.

222
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:23,522
And you made me miss
the birth of my daughter.

223
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,235
Son of a bitch.

224
00:16:30,404 --> 00:16:31,447
How much?

225
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,410
-How much what?
-How much did you get for the deal?

226
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:41,999
One-point-two million.

227
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,627
Six hundred thousand each.

228
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:46,629
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

229
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:49,382
Saul's cut is 20 percent.

230
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:53,261
All right.
So where's my money?

231
00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:55,972
What?

232
00:16:57,807 --> 00:17:00,059
You are joking, right?

233
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:04,146
If I gave you that money...

234
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:06,524
...you would be dead
inside of a week.

235
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,320
Man, look, I'm off the heroin.

236
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:14,907
I didn't even like it anyway.
It made me sick.

237
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:17,034
And the.... And the meth.

238
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:20,580
You know, I could take it or leave it.

239
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:23,374
I'm clean, Mr. White.

240
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,167
For real.

241
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:39,599
Prove it. Pee in that.

242
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:42,643
-How gay are you, seriously?
-Pee in it.

243
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:45,187
They're selling testing kits
at the drugstores.

244
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:48,733
If you are clean,
I will give you every last dime.

245
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:51,235
No, huh?

246
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,947
Well, I guess, until then
you'll just have to depend...

247
00:17:55,156 --> 00:17:58,117
...on the kindness of strangers
to get high.

248
00:17:58,326 --> 00:18:01,120
That and your little junkie girlfriend.

249
00:18:28,898 --> 00:18:30,483
Not on her tummy, Walt.

250
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:33,444
I'm not putting her on her tummy.

251
00:18:33,653 --> 00:18:36,280
I'll put her on her side.
Do you wanna hold her back?

252
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:38,241
-Yeah.
-Right there.

253
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:40,952
Just in case she decides
to do a little spit-up...

254
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,915
...I'm gonna roll up a nice clean towel
like this and put it under.

255
00:18:46,874 --> 00:18:49,210
Hammacher Schlemmer
makes a proper one of those.

256
00:18:49,418 --> 00:18:51,837
-It's hypoallergenic.
-Oh, yeah?

257
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:54,340
Well, I think a towel will do.

258
00:18:58,302 --> 00:18:59,929
Skyler, what is it?

259
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:05,184
Your son. He is just unbelievable.
Come see what he did.

260
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:14,610
-I told you it's not ready yet.
-Honey, just show it to them.

261
00:19:34,088 --> 00:19:36,591
My God, son. That's wonderful.

262
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,217
Flynn.

263
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:40,803
This is beautiful.

264
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:44,390
SaveWalterWhite.com.

265
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:47,810
Well, I, for one,
am telling everybody.

266
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:53,316
Wait a minute. You're not asking
for money, are you, son?

267
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:55,484
Yeah. That's the whole idea.

268
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:58,821
Louis helped me set up
a PayPal account and everything.

269
00:19:59,614 --> 00:20:02,825
-See?
-But we can't ask for money.

270
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:05,953
Walt.

271
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,123
Okay.

272
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:13,377
I appreciate it. I really do.

273
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:16,088
Show me what else you put on.

274
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:22,220
This was all his idea.
He worked so hard on it.

275
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:24,430
-Just let him help.
-Skyler.

276
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:28,517
It's-- You can't ask him
to take it down.

277
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:32,647
-It'll crush him.
-Skyler, it's charity.

278
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:39,946
Why do you say that
like it's some sort of dirty word?

279
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:51,624
This is insane.

280
00:20:51,832 --> 00:20:53,960
I have so much cash on hand...

281
00:20:54,168 --> 00:20:57,046
...that I actually count it
by weighing it on my bathroom scale.

282
00:20:57,255 --> 00:21:00,633
And yet, I can't spend it.
I can't tell my family about it.

283
00:21:00,841 --> 00:21:03,678
All of whom think that I am
right on the edge of bankruptcy.

284
00:21:03,886 --> 00:21:05,388
I mean, it's--

285
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,223
It's insane.

286
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:10,476
Well, I guess that's why
gangsters had molls.

287
00:21:11,143 --> 00:21:12,270
What?

288
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:13,980
Gun molls.

289
00:21:14,188 --> 00:21:16,148
<i>Haven't you ever seen White Heat?</i>

290
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:18,818
<i>Yeah, I've seen White Heat...</i>

291
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:21,946
-...but I don't see how that pertains.
-Maybe you need a moll...

292
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:24,824
...more than a wife
who you can't trust with your secrets.

293
00:21:25,032 --> 00:21:26,576
-Just--
-What good is money...

294
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:29,328
...that doesn't spend?
The tree falls in the forest....

295
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:33,082
You know, you get the point.
So communicating is out?

296
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,668
Out.

297
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,253
Let's see. What else is there?

298
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:39,755
There's always,
"Hey, I found a big bag of money...

299
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:41,716
...down by the railroad tracks."

300
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:44,468
No? No? Works for me.

301
00:21:45,428 --> 00:21:46,470
Uncle Murray.

302
00:21:47,513 --> 00:21:48,764
Oh, yeah.

303
00:21:49,765 --> 00:21:51,475
Yeah,
"Oh, many is the happy memory...

304
00:21:51,684 --> 00:21:53,603
...of Uncle Murray
bouncing me on his knee.

305
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:56,480
We lost track of
the old pervert years ago...

306
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:59,901
-...but he kicked it, left me millions."
-No, no.

307
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:05,364
It cannot be blind luck or some
imaginary relative who saves us.

308
00:22:05,573 --> 00:22:08,117
No, I earned that money, me.

309
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,828
And now my son created
his own website...

310
00:22:11,037 --> 00:22:15,041
...SaveWalterWhite.com,
soliciting anonymous donations.

311
00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:18,920
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

312
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:26,219
Yeah, look at that.
It's got PayPal and everything.

313
00:22:26,427 --> 00:22:29,722
Cyber-begging. That's all that is.

314
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:33,059
Just rattling a little tin cup
to the entire world.

315
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:35,853
Yeah, there's no deep-seated
issues there.

316
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:39,232
Walter, I'm looking at the answer here.
It's staring me in the face.

317
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,235
-Do I have to spell it out for you?
-I know. I know.

318
00:22:42,443 --> 00:22:44,737
You're thinking that I should be
funnelling money...

319
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,073
...into my son's website,
but absolutely not.

320
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:49,909
I am not going to have
my family think that some...

321
00:22:50,117 --> 00:22:52,286
...mystery benefactor saved us.

322
00:22:52,495 --> 00:22:55,456
Not some mystery benefactor,
singular.

323
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,000
That would raise too many questions.
However--

324
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:00,253
Stay with me here.

325
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:02,004
--zombies.

326
00:23:03,631 --> 00:23:07,009
<i>I got a guy, who knows this guy,
who knows this Rain Man-type.</i>

327
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:10,596
He lives with his mother
in her basement in Belarus, all right?

328
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:13,724
So good luck extraditing
his fat Russian ass.

329
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:17,353
Wait. He's a hacker-cracker
extraordinaire.

330
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,189
This guy can hijack
random desktops...

331
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:24,068
...all around the world, turn them
into zombies that do his bidding.

332
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:28,739
For instance, he can make it
so 20- or 30,000...

333
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:32,285
...little donations come in
from all over the U.S. and Canada.

334
00:23:32,493 --> 00:23:34,537
Ten, 20, 50 bucks a pop...

335
00:23:34,745 --> 00:23:37,999
...all paid in full, nice and neat,
untraceable...

336
00:23:38,207 --> 00:23:42,128
...from the good-hearted people
of the world to Mr. Walter H. White...

337
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,463
...cancer saint.

338
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:48,342
I'm getting a warm and fuzzy feeling
just thinking about it.

339
00:23:51,846 --> 00:23:56,809
He's an asshole, that's what.
Always judging me.

340
00:23:57,852 --> 00:23:59,312
Not too much.

341
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,981
I mean, like, who is he, right?

342
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:04,901
I mean, first off, I taught him.

343
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:08,154
Always acting like
I'm his indentured servant.

344
00:24:18,956 --> 00:24:20,750
Now the cotton.

345
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,673
Needle?

346
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,012
-I don't understand why you need him.
-Exactly.

347
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:37,850
My point exactly.

348
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:50,363
Flat against your skin
so it doesn't wiggle around too much.

349
00:24:55,117 --> 00:24:57,328
How much does he owe you,
anyway?

350
00:24:58,704 --> 00:25:01,040
Four hundred and eighty.

351
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,585
Oh, hell, I'd be mad too
if somebody owed me 500 bucks.

352
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,004
No, no.

353
00:25:07,755 --> 00:25:09,549
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

354
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,552
What?

355
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:16,055
What?

356
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,307
Thousand.

357
00:25:20,434 --> 00:25:22,228
Not on your back,
in case you throw up.

358
00:25:22,436 --> 00:25:25,731
On your side. Sleep on your side.

359
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,159
And she's all like:

360
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:40,913
"Don't preach to me." And I'm like,
"Baby, I'm not preaching to you.

361
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,791
I'm talking about basic survival,
you know?

362
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,836
I'm conversing
about life and death."

363
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:49,755
I mean, this here,
what we've been doing...

364
00:25:49,964 --> 00:25:52,008
...hell, Becky knows.

365
00:25:57,805 --> 00:25:59,223
Dad?

366
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,601
I overslept. I'm on my way.

367
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,450
Dad?

368
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:20,453
Dad, wait.

369
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:23,122
Dad, it's not what it looks like.

370
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,458
Dad.

371
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,004
Dad, will just wait? Let me--
Just talk to you for one second.

372
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,297
No, Dad.

373
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:33,799
Dad, come on.

374
00:26:37,428 --> 00:26:38,804
Dad?

375
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:43,309
Dad, no. No, stop it!
Don't touch him, Dad!

376
00:26:43,517 --> 00:26:45,853
-Dad, stop. Dad, let him go!
-Son of a bitch.

377
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:50,650
Dad, no. Stop it!
Stop it, Dad! Stop it!

378
00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:53,694
-Get away from me, man. Back off.
-Jesse.

379
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:54,946
-Jesse, no!
-Back off!

380
00:26:55,154 --> 00:26:57,865
-Okay, everybody just calm down!
-What's with you, yo?

381
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:01,369
-Because I'll seriously bust you up.
-You miserable little smackhead.

382
00:27:01,577 --> 00:27:03,663
-Get the hell out!
-Hey, I pay my rent, bitch!

383
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:05,331
All right? I got civil rights.

384
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:07,291
Dad, no! Okay!

385
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,002
Jesse, come on.
Please, no. Come on.

386
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:13,005
I pay my rent.

387
00:27:14,757 --> 00:27:17,176
You're going back to rehab.
Today. Now.

388
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,762
Look, as it so happens,
we were just....

389
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,597
We were just talking
about that now.

390
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,016
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I was gonna tell you, okay?

391
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,686
-If you would just let me.
-Eighteen months.

392
00:27:26,894 --> 00:27:30,314
You have been clean for 18 months,
Jane. Why? Why do you do it?

393
00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:33,693
I backslid, okay?

394
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,653
Like, what?

395
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,864
What, you think I'm proud of this?

396
00:27:38,072 --> 00:27:39,907
Like I do it on purpose?

397
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,534
Lying to me...

398
00:27:41,742 --> 00:27:44,704
...shacking up and using
with this scumbag, this loser.

399
00:27:44,912 --> 00:27:46,080
It takes one to know one.

400
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,208
His name is Jesse. You don't know
the first thing about him.

401
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,044
We talk about rehab every night.
It's his idea.

402
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,131
You talk about rehab?
Well, gee, isn't that wonderful?

403
00:27:55,923 --> 00:28:00,219
Thank you for not being judgemental
24 hours a day.

404
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:04,307
Because that's exactly what I need,
to be judged all the time!

405
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,393
Okay.

406
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,937
You know what you need?
I'll tell you what you need.

407
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,188
What are you doing?

408
00:28:11,397 --> 00:28:14,025
-What are you doing?
-I am calling the police.

409
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:18,029
-Dad. Dad, no, don't.
-Come on. Come on!

410
00:28:18,237 --> 00:28:20,281
-Dad, no. Don't.
-I have tried 10 years...

411
00:28:20,489 --> 00:28:21,991
...of love and understanding.

412
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,328
Maybe what it takes
is you drying out in a jail cell.

413
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:26,913
Dad, no.

414
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:30,499
Yes, I would like to report drug use
in a building that I own.

415
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,961
-Dad. Daddy, no.
-No. It's ongoing. It's illegal activity.

416
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,922
-I'd like to talk to somebody.
-Daddy.

417
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,758
-Would you connect me, please?
-Fine, we'll go to rehab.

418
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:41,010
I could care less
about him going to rehab.

419
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,638
-I want you in rehab.
-I'll go first thing tomorrow.

420
00:28:43,846 --> 00:28:45,556
Not tomorrow. Today.

421
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:49,018
I have to call into work.
I have to stop the newspaper.

422
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:53,189
The last time I went, my houseplants
died because you didn't water them.

423
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,778
Daddy, please?

424
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,196
I'll go.

425
00:29:00,404 --> 00:29:02,949
<i>Albuquerque Police.
How may I direct your call?</i>

426
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:05,451
Tomorrow.

427
00:29:05,993 --> 00:29:07,328
<i>Hello?</i>

428
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,165
<i>Hello?</i>

429
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,125
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

430
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:19,799
Tomorrow.

431
00:29:38,484 --> 00:29:40,152
You meant all that?

432
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,531
I don't know.

433
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,159
I just think
if we had enough money...

434
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,663
...nobody could make us
do anything.

435
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,527
Oh, just let it ring.

436
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:24,197
No, I'm gonna go see who it is.

437
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,117
It's okay, Holly.

438
00:30:28,492 --> 00:30:30,536
It's okay, sweetie.

439
00:30:31,245 --> 00:30:32,455
Good luck with that.

440
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:36,209
But I'm sure he'd be glad to,
you know, write some--

441
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:41,130
You know, actually, here he is
right now. So hold on a second.

442
00:30:41,797 --> 00:30:43,466
-What?
-It's one of your....

443
00:30:43,674 --> 00:30:47,678
One of your old students
wants a letter of recommendation.

444
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,224
Oh, okay. Thanks.

445
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:54,560
Oh, honey,
I think the baby is getting hungry.

446
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,981
<i>-This is Walter White.
-Hello, Walter White.</i>

447
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,571
I'm sorry.
I'm having a little trouble recalling--

448
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,281
It's Jane.

449
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,408
You know, of Jesse and Jane.

450
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:10,868
<i>Jesse's "junkie girlfriend."</i>

451
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:16,123
Oh, yes, yes. Of course.
It really has been a long time.

452
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,875
Get somewhere
where you can talk.

453
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:22,755
Sure. Yes.
I am looking into that as we speak.

454
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:28,761
How the hell did you get this number?
Did Jesse give it to you?

455
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,722
All Jesse wants
is what's coming to him.

456
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,432
No more, no less.

457
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,101
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

458
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:36,936
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

459
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,735
<i>-He told you about the money.
-He told me everything.</i>

460
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,951
So, what is this?

461
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,788
What, some kind of blackmail
or something?

462
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,957
This is me telling you
to do right by Jesse.

463
00:31:58,165 --> 00:31:59,625
Bring him what you owe him.

464
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,252
<i>I don't call that blackmail.</i>

465
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,630
<i>I call that you getting off your ass,
and being a decent human being.</i>

466
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,382
Well, I call it blackmail.

467
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:10,344
Dialling my number.
Talking to my wife.

468
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,597
And what's your end of this?

469
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:16,142
How much heroin
does a half a million dollars buy?

470
00:32:17,643 --> 00:32:20,313
For your information,
I am holding Jesse's money for him...

471
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,648
<i>...and he will receive
every last dollar of it.</i>

472
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,317
He will, not you...

473
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,152
...at a time when I see fit.

474
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,821
But I will not contribute
to his overdose.

475
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,741
<i>Now you tell him, if he gets clean--</i>

476
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:33,951
<i>-If you both get clean--
-You know what?</i>

477
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,828
I take that back. This is blackmail.

478
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,414
Because what I know about you,
high-school teacher...

479
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,250
<i>...turned drug dealer,
with a brother-in-law in the DEA...</i>

480
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,670
<i>...that would make one hell of a story.
National news, I'll bet.</i>

481
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:50,635
Do right by Jesse tonight
or I will burn you to the ground.

482
00:32:58,684 --> 00:32:59,727
Shit.

483
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:06,359
He's a high-school teacher. What's
he gonna do, give you a B-minus?

484
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,195
Send you outside
to clap the erasers?

485
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:15,159
You wouldn't really go to the cops,
would you?

486
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,537
We won't have to. He'll pay.

487
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,122
And what if he doesn't?

488
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,208
Jesse, it's your money.

489
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:26,879
You're in the right here. He's in
the wrong. He's not stupid. He'll pay.

490
00:33:31,425 --> 00:33:33,219
What is it, really?

491
00:33:33,427 --> 00:33:35,805
You don't want
your half a million dollars?

492
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:39,559
You wanna renounce your earthly
possessions and become a monk?

493
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:45,273
No, it's just,
I'm not the kind of dude who rolls.

494
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:48,734
And by extension, you know,
neither are you.

495
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,742
I mean, he's my partner.

496
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,706
I'm your partner.

497
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,091
<i>The largest land animal
in all the planet...</i>

498
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,969
<i>...lives in a tightly knit
matriarchal society...</i>

499
00:34:15,177 --> 00:34:17,263
<i>...led by the eldest female
in the herd.</i>

500
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,268
<i>Close your eyes and go to sleep.</i>

501
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:18,574
She is finally asleep.

502
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:26,165
What you doing,
learning about elephants?

503
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:41,180
Oh, honey, we're out of diapers.
Would you mind going out?

504
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,011
Jesse.

505
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,221
Not you.

506
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,196
Nice job wearing the pants.

507
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,580
How do I know she'll keep quiet?

508
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:50,166
I guess you don't.

509
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,713
You'll never hear
from either of us again.

510
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,719
You're not seeing straight, Jesse.

511
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,888
You are making a mistake.

512
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,615
-Do you know what this is?
-It's a whole lot of cheddar.

513
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,408
This is freedom.

514
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,453
This is saying,
"I can go anywhere I want.

515
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,956
I can be anybody."

516
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,624
Who do you wanna be?

517
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,961
Where do you wanna go?
South America? Europe? Australia?

518
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,464
-Is New Zealand part of Australia?
-New Zealand is New Zealand.

519
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,757
Right on.

520
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:43,135
<i>New Zealand. That's where
they made Lord of the Rings.</i>

521
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,222
I say we just move there, yo.
I mean, you can do your art.

522
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,183
Right? Like, you can paint, like,
the local castles and shit.

523
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,477
And I can be a bush pilot.

524
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,272
Yeah. New Zealand.
I can get behind that.

525
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,568
But I guess I'm good anywhere
as long as it's the two of us.

526
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,493
But first, we gotta get clean.

527
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,662
And not because
anybody is telling us to.

528
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:14,792
-We do this for us, right?
-Yeah. Absolutely. For us.

529
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,962
All this here, we're not gonna
just shoot this up our arms, Jesse.

530
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,213
We're not.

531
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,924
Hell, no. No, no, no.
We're better than that.

532
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,760
We're way better than that. I say....

533
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,806
I say we flush what we've got left
and we start tonight.

534
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,228
Yeah, we can do that.

535
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,522
Definitely.

536
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,528
Excuse me.

537
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,872
What can I get you?

538
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,084
Give me a Fat Tire draught, please.

539
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,842
Damn it.

540
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,388
Hey, honey.

541
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,266
No. I don't know what to tell you.

542
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:16,771
Three stores I've been to so far,
and not one of them have it in stock.

543
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,691
Well, do they have
to be diapers for newborns?

544
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,778
What if we went up a size
and just kind of....

545
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,614
All right, all right. No, I understand.

546
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,825
All right. No, I'll just keep looking.

547
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,704
I'm pulling into Wal-Mart now, so....

548
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,666
Yeah. Okay. Love you.

549
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,501
Thank you.

550
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,753
God.

551
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,965
Well played.

552
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,851
They found water on Mars.

553
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,271
They have indeed.

554
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,940
Don't know what to do
with that information...

555
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,609
...but, hey, God bless them,
they found it.

556
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:08,072
Oh, well, actually...

557
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:12,994
...they theoretically can separate
the hydrogen from the oxygen...

558
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:17,415
...and process that into providing
fuel for manned space flights.

559
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:21,961
Ostensibly, turning Mars into
a giant gas station.

560
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,963
So it's a....

561
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:28,801
Yeah. We live in an amazing time.

562
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:33,931
-To water on Mars.
-To water on Mars.

563
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:40,104
So, what did you have? Girl or boy?

564
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,649
-Little girl.
-That's nice.

565
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,067
-Thanks.
-Congratulations.

566
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,319
Thank you.

567
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,988
-I have a daughter.
-Yeah?

568
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,823
How old?

569
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,491
Old enough to know better.

570
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,328
Twenty-seven next month.

571
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,125
-You have other kids?
-Just the one.

572
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:06,797
I've got a 16-year-old boy.
Well, he's almost 16.

573
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:11,135
Jeez. Oh, there's a spread, huh?

574
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,721
But he helps out, though.

575
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,807
He's even changing some diapers
now, so....

576
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,228
It's more than I managed to do
when I was his age.

577
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:24,023
Kids today grow up faster, I think.

578
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,485
Oh, yeah. Yeah, maybe so.

579
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,072
So, any advice?

580
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,909
Having a daughter. Any advice?

581
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,704
No, not really. Just love them.

582
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,540
Just-- Yeah.

583
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:44,293
I mean, they are who they are.

584
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,547
Yeah.

585
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:52,843
I've got this nephew.

586
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:59,141
This nephew who is--
I mean, he's an adult.

587
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:05,690
But you can't infantilize them,
you can't live their life for them.

588
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:09,777
But still, I mean,
there is that frustration.

589
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,487
You know, that....

590
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,074
God, that frustration
that goes along with, you know:

591
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:19,328
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know
what is best for you, so listen."

592
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,624
But of course, they don't.

593
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:28,421
I mean, what do you do
with someone like that?

594
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,506
Family?

595
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:36,888
Yeah. Family.

596
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:40,099
You can't give up on them. Never.

597
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:43,352
I mean, what else is there?

598
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:32,193
Jesse, it's me.

599
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,452
Jesse, I just wanna talk.

600
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,908
Jesus.

601
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:38,801
Jesse.

602
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,391
Jesse.

603
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:49,687
Jesse, wake up.

604
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,523
Jesse, wake up.

605
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:23,262
No, no, no.
