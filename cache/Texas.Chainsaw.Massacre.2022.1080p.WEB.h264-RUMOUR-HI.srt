00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,458
without the violence and the madness.

159
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,541
Somewhere safe.

160
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,708
Okay. And, I mean, seven hours by car?

161
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,083
I guess I can say goodbye
to my friends forever.

162
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,791
[door creaking, bangs]

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,500
Oh Christ.

164
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,666
What is he doing here?

165
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,375
Excuse me.

166
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:29,250
Oh shit, sorry, uh, Richter.
We spoke on the phone.

167
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,708
- Yeah.
- Dante.

168
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:31,625
[Richter] Hey.

169
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,500
[laughs]

170
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,583
Uh, Richter's our contractor, Mel.

171
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,166
Gave your buildings a facelift,

172
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,875
about all I can do in a week.

173
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,875
It looks good for the auction. Thank you.

174
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,083
You're planning to sell these?

175
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,708
- Oh yeah, we will.
- Mm-hmm.

176
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,791
All right.

177
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,416
So you guys are what? Like, a cult?

178
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:58,291
We are idealistic individuals
who want to build a better world.

179
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,750
Yeah, that's a cult.

180
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:00,750
[chuckles]

181
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,500
- What?
- It's all right, not judging.

182
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,833
Just pay me. We're good.

183
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,000
Hey guys, you should, uh…
you should see this.

184
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:14,875
[Dante] What?

185
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,750
- [Dante's partner] Oh…
- [Mel] Oh shit.

186
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,208
What?

187
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,541
Are you serious?

188
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,500
- Newsflash, we're in deep Texas.
- I don't care.

189
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,041
We have a bus full of
potential investors on the way.

190
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,916
They see this flag, they're not gonna buy.

191
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,541
- Trust me.
- I'm getting the cowboy.

192
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,791
Mel, help me.

193
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,291
I'll just be here.

194
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,375
[ominous music playing]

195
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,750
- [door creaking]
- Hmm…

196
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,875
Um, I'm going upstairs.

197
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,333
[Mel] Look at this place. It's weird.

198
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,708
Ah, shit.

199
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,791
[grunting]

200
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,083
[children laughing faintly]

201
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,791
Damn, I couldn't reach it.

202
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:32,125
- Oh shit. Well, what are we going to do?
- Let's just wait for the contractor.

203
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,875
What are you doing in our house?

204
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,833
Uh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize--

205
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,833
We thought this place was empty.

206
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,333
[tank wheels creaking]

207
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:47,041
[woman breathing heavily]

208
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,125
Oh, you're the new neighbors, aren't you?

209
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,333
Uh…

210
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,708
Wish I'd known y'all were coming.

211
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,875
I'd have put my face on.

212
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,416
Sweet tea?

213
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,375
I've been running this orphanage
for nearly 50 years.

214
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:20,583
I've housed boys and girls
in need of a loving home,

215
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:25,500
and troubled teens that needed me
to show 'em mercy for their ways.

216
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,375
Please.

217
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:33,708
Ma'am, the bank, um,
reclaimed this property months ago.

218
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,375
You're not supposed to be here.

219
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:43,250
You talking about
that whole mix up with the bank?

220
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,958
That's been settled.

221
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:49,583
I paid everything I owed.
This is still our house.

222
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,708
You're wrong. I'm sorry, but--

223
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,083
I've got a title that says otherwise.

224
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,791
Do you mind if we see that?

225
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,666
I don't have to show you anything.

226
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,875
- That's because you don't have it.
- [Mel] Dante, don't.

227
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,416
What? Was this about my flag?

228
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,500
You got me all wrong.

229
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:16,750
I've taken care of
many boys like you over the years.

230
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,208
I don't have a problem with Negroes.

231
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,125
[scoffs]

232
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,708
Okay. Fuck this.

233
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,541
You watch your mouth, boy.

234
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,041
[Dante] You watch yours.

235
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,375
[Mel] Where are you going?

236
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,875
[Dante] Let the cops deal with her.
I don't have time for this.

237
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,708
I'm getting the sheriff.

238
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,458
[woman] It's not what you think.

239
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,041
That flag belonged to my great granddaddy.

240
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,458
It reminds me of him.

241
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,375
I haven't given it much thought.

242
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,875
I… I understand your friend.

243
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,625
I wish I could help you,
but you can't be here.

244
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,625
- [gasps]
- There are shelters for the elderly, and…

245
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:04,708
Shelter? I'm not going anywhere.

246
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:08,041
I told you. This is our house.

247
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,041
Look, you'll be safer in a home
and better taken care of.

248
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,375
A woman your age shouldn't be on her own.

249
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,875
[wheezing]

250
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:21,666
Baby, I'm fine. I'm all right.

251
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,125
Just go back to your room.

252
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,375
He's the last of my boys.

253
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,666
He needs special care.

254
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,875
He doesn't do well outside,
you understand that?

255
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,750
It's why I can't ever leave here.

256
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,083
- [Mel gasps]
- [door creaks]

257
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,250
Christ, Ginny, why are you still here?

258
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,250
What have you done?

259
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,916
[sheriff] Virginia, we told you weeks ago.

260
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,958
She ain't listening.
Let's get her outta here.

261
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,375
- We'll talk about it outside.
- Come on. Let's go.

262
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,541
[grunting]

263
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:51,666
Take it easy.

264
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,958
I barely touched her.

265
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:53,875
[retching]

266
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,791
Oh my God. What is happening?
We need to call an ambulance.

267
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,333
[deputy] We are the ambulance.

268
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,208
It's all right. It's her boy.

269
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,333
[Virginia wheezes]

270
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:05,125
[sheriff] Grab the oxygen.
Put her in the van.

271
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,083
She's having a heart attack.

272
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,291
[Virginia] The check… It was… Please…

273
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,625
Hey, hey, what did you do?

274
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,333
[sheriff] We'll get you to
the hospital in no time. Just hold on.

275
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,958
Shit. The bus is here.

276
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,458
- [Dante] Fuck.
- [brakes screeching]

277
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,750
I'm going with her.

278
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,416
No, Melody, no, no, no.
I'll go with her. I'll go.

279
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,375
What?

280
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,375
Everyone's expecting
to see the two of you.

281
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,333
She'll be okay.

282
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,291
Come on.

283
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,666
- Christ.
- [Dante's partner] Somebody needs to.

284
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,375
It can't be Melody, can't be you.

285
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,958
You need to focus on this.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

286
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,416
Okay. Please just
make sure she's all right.

287
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,125
Thank you. You're an angel.

288
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,291
[sheriff] Let's move.

289
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,166
[Virginia breathing raggedly]

290
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,958
Here's your flag.

291
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,208
[Dante] Come on, Mel.
We'll get somebody to clean that up.

292
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,750
Did that not feel like a bad omen to you?

293
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,041
This place is cursed now.

294
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,833
Please, this is not--

295
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,291
I don't need this right now,
so… it's all good.

296
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,458
If you move here,
I'm moving back with Dad.

297
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,458
No, you're not.

298
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,666
I… I don't want to live here.
Your whole idea is insane.

299
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,541
- You don't know what you want.
- Okay, and you do?

300
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,750
Uh, I know you need me,
and you can't take care of yourself.

301
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,541
Wait.

302
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,541
Why did I…? [sighs]

303
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,875
[woman] Honestly, the bank
could've never dreamed of selling these

304
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,166
without your help, Dante.

305
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,166
- [Dante] Thank you for trusting us.
- It's amazing.

306
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,541
Absolutely. Um…

307
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,708
Mel! Mel! Catherine, come here.

308
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,833
This is Catherine,
you know, from the bank.

309
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,708
- She made all this possible.
- [Catherine gasps]

310
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,833
Finally. It's nice to meet you.

311
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,125
[chuckles]

312
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:01,083
You know, everyone is super excited.
You guys did a great job promoting this.

313
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,958
Yeah, just needs a fresh coat of paint.

314
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,125
Oh no, it is perfect like this.

315
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,708
These people want the wear-down.
You know, the history?

316
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:08,833
