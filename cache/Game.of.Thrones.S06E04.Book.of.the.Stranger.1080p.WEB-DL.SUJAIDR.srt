1
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:18,450
Where you gonna go?

2
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:21,170
South.

3
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:24,239
What are you gonna do?

4
00:02:24,342 --> 00:02:26,041
Get warm.

5
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:35,601
I was with you
at Hardhome.

6
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:39,254
We saw
what's out there.

7
00:02:39,357 --> 00:02:40,723
We know
it's coming here.

8
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:43,258
How can you
leave us now?

9
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:45,861
I did everything I could.
You know that.

10
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:49,431
- You swore a vow.
- Aye, I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.

11
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:51,283
- I gave my life.
- For all nights to come.

12
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:53,819
They killed me, Edd!
My own brothers.

13
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:55,788
You want me to stay
here after that?

14
00:02:55,906 --> 00:02:59,441
<i>Riders approaching!</i>

15
00:02:59,543 --> 00:03:01,577
<i>Open the gate!</i>

16
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:37,172
This is good soup.

17
00:04:39,677 --> 00:04:42,811
Do you remember those kidney
pies Old Nan used to make?

18
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:45,481
- With the peas and onions?
- Mmm.

19
00:04:48,185 --> 00:04:51,103
We never should
have left Winterfell.

20
00:04:51,188 --> 00:04:53,989
Don't you wish we could
go back to the day we left?

21
00:04:55,943 --> 00:04:59,661
I want to scream at myself,
"Don't go, you idiot."

22
00:04:59,747 --> 00:05:01,814
How could we know?

23
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:06,034
I spent a lot of time thinking
about what an ass I was to you.

24
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:10,071
<i>I wish I could
change everything.</i>

25
00:05:10,174 --> 00:05:11,290
We were children.

26
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,008
I was awful,
just admit it.

27
00:05:15,212 --> 00:05:17,596
You were
occasionally awful.

28
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:19,515
I'm sure I can't
have been great fun.

29
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,384
Always sulking in the corner
while the rest of you played.

30
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,303
- Can you forgive me?
- There's nothing to forgive.

31
00:05:24,388 --> 00:05:26,421
- Forgive me.
- All right.

32
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:28,524
All right,
I forgive you.

33
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:47,709
You'd think after
thousands of years,

34
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:50,715
the Night's Watch would have
learned how to make a good ale.

35
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:55,083
Where will you go?

36
00:05:56,837 --> 00:05:59,421
Where will<i> we</i> go?

37
00:05:59,523 --> 00:06:02,891
If I don't watch over you, Father's
ghost will come back and murder me.

38
00:06:05,596 --> 00:06:07,229
Where will we go?

39
00:06:07,314 --> 00:06:09,815
I can't stay here,
not after what happened.

40
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:11,967
<i>There's only one place
we can go.</i>

41
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,152
Home.

42
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,559
Should we tell the Boltons
to pack up and leave?

43
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:19,528
We'll take it back
from them.

44
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:23,662
I don't have an army.

45
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:25,864
How many wildlings
did you save?

46
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,590
They didn't come here
to serve me.

47
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:29,952
They owe you
their lives.

48
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:33,205
You think they'll be safe here if Roose
Bolton remains Warden of the North?

49
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,674
- Sansa.
- Winterfell is our home.

50
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:39,294
It's ours and Arya's
and Bran's and Rickon's.

51
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,513
Wherever they are,
it belongs to our family.

52
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:42,965
We have to fight for it.

53
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,183
I'm tired of fighting.

54
00:06:47,104 --> 00:06:49,972
It's all I've done
since I left home.

55
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:52,017
I've killed brothers
of the Night's Watch.

56
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:54,776
I've killed wildlings.
I've killed men that I admire.

57
00:06:54,862 --> 00:06:58,313
I hanged a boy
younger than Bran.

58
00:07:00,818 --> 00:07:05,153
I fought and I lost.

59
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:12,494
If we don't take back the North,
we'll never be safe.

60
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:16,381
I want you to help me.

61
00:07:17,885 --> 00:07:20,502
But I'll do it myself
if I have to.

62
00:07:23,557 --> 00:07:25,724
My lady.

63
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,427
Ser Davos.

64
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:33,432
Will you stay here
at Castle Black?

65
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:37,269
I will do
as Jon Snow commands.

66
00:07:37,354 --> 00:07:39,187
You serve Jon Snow now?

67
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:42,884
He's the prince
that was promised.

68
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:47,079
Forgive me, my lady,
I thought that was Stannis.

69
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,174
What happened
down there?

70
00:08:01,428 --> 00:08:04,429
There was a battle.
Stannis was defeated.

71
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:08,583
And Shireen?

72
00:08:08,686 --> 00:08:10,218
What happened
to the princess?

73
00:08:10,304 --> 00:08:13,021
I saw what happened.

74
00:08:13,107 --> 00:08:15,941
I saw Stannis' forces
defeated in the field.

75
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,943
My lady,
I'm Ser Davos Seaworth.

76
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:19,645
We've met before.

77
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,480
I was Kingsguard
to Renly Baratheon.

78
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:25,734
Before Renly was assassinated
with bloodmagic.

79
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:28,537
That's in the past now.

80
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:31,823
Yes, it's in the past.

81
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:34,459
It doesn't mean
I forget.

82
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:37,546
Or forgive.

83
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,096
He admitted it,
you know.

84
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:42,951
Who did?

85
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:45,120
Stannis.

86
00:08:45,222 --> 00:08:47,339
Just before
I executed him.

87
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:35,336
The Defender of the Vale!

88
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:37,055
Uncle Petyr!

89
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:45,530
My lord.

90
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:47,199
Come and see.

91
00:09:47,317 --> 00:09:49,951
I missed your name day.
Go on.

92
00:09:51,238 --> 00:09:54,355
A falcon!

93
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,824
A gyrfalcon.

94
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:57,375
The greatest and rarest
of birds.

95
00:09:57,494 --> 00:10:00,195
Last time
I saw you, Baelish,

96
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:04,499
you told me you were taking Sansa
Stark home with you to the Fingers.

97
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:05,867
Indeed I was.

98
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:08,170
And yet not long ago,
we received reports

99
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,415
that she has been married to
Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.

100
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:15,043
On our way to the Fingers, we were set
upon by a large force of Bolton men.

101
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:19,598
Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling
and exactly whom we were transporting.

102
00:10:19,683 --> 00:10:21,399
Do you take me
for a fool?

103
00:10:21,518 --> 00:10:24,385
Tell me, Lord Royce,

104
00:10:24,488 --> 00:10:27,888
how many people knew of my
travel plans with Sansa Stark?

105
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:31,243
I shared my intentions
with you

106
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:33,495
<i>and no one else.</i>

107
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,365
Slander a man
in his own home,

108
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:40,252
you might find yourself
crossing swords with him.

109
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:45,006
Your home is the Vale.
The Lord of the Vale stands before us.

110
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:47,876
And only his judgment
concerns me.

111
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:56,721
<i>Shall we throw him
through the Moon Door?</i>

112
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,143
My lord.

113
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:09,815
My lord, I have always been
faithful to House Arryn.

114
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,020
To your father, to your mother,
and now to you.

115
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:16,278
Do you believe him,
Uncle Petyr?

116
00:11:23,797 --> 00:11:26,915
Lord Royce has served
the Vale well.

117
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,752
He's enjoyed a distinguished
military career.

118
00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:34,389
If we could trust
his absolute loyalty,

119
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:37,154
he would make a capable
commander in the wars to come.

120
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:44,149
You can trust my absolute
loyalty, my lord.

121
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:47,068
I think he deserves one more chance.
What do you say?

122
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:55,660
Fine.

123
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:05,203
I bring good news.

124
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:07,889
My friends in the North tell me
Sansa has escaped Winterfell.

125
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,758
I expect she's headed
to Castle Black

126
00:12:09,843 --> 00:12:12,177
where her brother serves
as Lord Commander.

127
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:16,497
But she won't be safe there,
not with the Boltons after her.

128
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:20,385
She's my cousin.

129
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,222
We should help her.

130
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:27,008
That was my instinct as well.

131
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,644
Our lord has spoken.

132
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:33,181
Gather the Knights
of the Vale.

133
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:36,318
The time has come
to join the fray.

134
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,690
<i>You invite the enemy
into our city?</i>

135
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:44,442
I did.

136
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:47,028
As a clever man
once told me,

137
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,798
"We make peace with our enemies,
not our friends."

138
00:12:49,883 --> 00:12:52,867
I don't make peace
with the queen's enemies.

139
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,052
I kill
the queen's enemies.

140
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:55,637
Yes, that's
the military approach.

141
00:12:55,722 --> 00:12:57,305
And how has that worked
here in Meereen?

142
00:12:57,391 --> 00:12:59,707
I represent
the diplomatic approach.

143
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,927
Our queen tried to make
peace with the Masters

144
00:13:02,012 --> 00:13:04,012
and they tried
to murder her.

145
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:07,048
We enter these negotiations
with open eyes.

146
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,435
Trust me.
My own recent experience with slavery

147
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,437
has taught me the horrors
of that institution.

148
00:13:12,522 --> 00:13:13,939
How many days
were you a slave?

149
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:16,024
Long enough to know.

150
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:19,160
Not long enough
to understand.

151
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:29,237
I bought this dwarf
for a single gold honor.

152
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,406
And somehow you've risen

153
00:13:31,508 --> 00:13:34,409
to the top of the Great
Pyramid of Meereen.

154
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:36,294
It's most impressive.

155
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,230
And now you speak for the
Good Masters of Astapor.

156
00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:41,683
Here's to reversals
of fortune.

157
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:43,351
We came here
to meet the queen

158
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:45,854
and instead we're greeted
by a dwarf and a eunuch.

159
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:49,757
Let's make this simple, shall we?
Tell me what you want.

160
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,777
We want you to leave
Slaver's Bay.

161
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:56,597
Take your dragons and
your mercenaries and go.

162
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,267
Queen Daenerys won't stay
in Meereen forever.

163
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:01,119
Her path takes
her westward.

164
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:03,571
When we last met,
I offered her ships

165
00:14:03,657 --> 00:14:07,542
so she could return to Westeros where
she belongs. She refused them.

166
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:09,747
She refused them because
hundreds of thousands

167
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,796
of men, women, and children
still lived in chains.

168
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:14,332
As they have
since the dawn of time.

169
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:17,602
- Not anymore.
- You think you're a free man now?

170
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,554
You still follow orders.

171
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,199
Just because your master
has silver hair and tits

172
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:24,009
doesn't mean
she's not a master.

173
00:14:24,094 --> 00:14:27,562
Friends, friends,
friends, please.

174
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:32,183
There have always been those with wealth
and power and those with nothing.

175
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:35,303
That is the way of the world. I'm not
here to change the way of the world.

176
00:14:35,405 --> 00:14:37,856
Slavery is the way
of our world.

177
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:41,443
You don't need slaves
to make money.

178
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:44,412
There haven't been slaves in
Westeros for hundreds of years

179
00:14:44,498 --> 00:14:46,658
and I grew up richer
than any of you.

180
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:52,153
But our queen recognizes
that she erred

181
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:54,873
by abolishing slavery

182
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,825
without providing
a new system to replace it.

183
00:14:57,928 --> 00:15:01,679
So here
is the queen's proposal.

184
00:15:01,798 --> 00:15:04,665
Slavery will never
return to Meereen,

185
00:15:04,768 --> 00:15:07,502
but she will give the other
cities of Slaver's Bay

186
00:15:07,604 --> 00:15:09,554
time to adjust
to the new order.

187
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,972
What does that mean?

188
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:14,192
Instead of abolishing
slavery overnight,

189
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:17,391
we will give you seven
years to end the practice.

190
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:23,985
Slaveholders
will be compensated

191
00:15:24,071 --> 00:15:26,821
for their losses,
of course, at fair prices.

192
00:15:26,907 --> 00:15:29,407
In exchange,
you will cut off

193
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:31,242
your support for
the Sons of the Harpy.

194
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:32,888
We do not support
the Sons of the Harpy.

195
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:36,047
Fine, fine, but you will
cut it off all the same.

196
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:40,201
I do hope you accept,
my friends.

197
00:15:40,303 --> 00:15:42,423
You will not receive
a better offer.

198
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:48,476
Let us sail
on the tide of freedom

199
00:15:48,562 --> 00:15:50,962
instead of being
drowned by it.

200
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:55,266
And as a parting gift
to our honored guests...

201
00:16:04,244 --> 00:16:06,060
Give freedom a chance.

202
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:09,523
See if it doesn't taste every bit
as good as what came before.

203
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,437
Perhaps I should
translate for you.

204
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:34,139
<i>We speak
the Common Tongue.</i>

205
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:37,725
- Excellent.
- You met with the slavers today.

206
00:16:37,811 --> 00:16:39,227
<i>I did.</i>

207
00:16:39,312 --> 00:16:41,312
Our brothers and sisters
died fighting this scum.

208
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:44,798
<i>Now you invite them to our
city and drink wine with them.</i>

209
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:50,655
I imagine
this room was built

210
00:16:50,757 --> 00:16:53,791
so the rulers could
intimidate the ruled.

211
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:57,662
But I am not your ruler.

212
00:16:57,747 --> 00:17:00,081
I'm not
the Breaker of Chains.

213
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:02,333
I'm not the Unburnt.

214
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:06,638
And I am certainly not
the Mother of Dragons.

215
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:08,789
You are a stranger here.

216
00:17:08,892 --> 00:17:11,809
So why do you represent Meereen
in these talks with our enemies?

217
00:17:11,928 --> 00:17:15,346
Because our queen
chose me as her advisor.

218
00:17:15,432 --> 00:17:17,565
Until she returns
from her travels...

219
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:19,150
When does she return?

220
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:21,686
Soon.
You have my word.

221
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:25,473
We don't know you. We don't trust you.
We know Torgo Nudho.

222
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:27,575
We fight with him against the Masters.
We trust him.

223
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:31,446
And that is exactly why Grey Worm
took part in these negotiations.

224
00:17:31,531 --> 00:17:35,166
<i>As commander of the Unsullied, he
knows how to defeat the slavers</i>

225
00:17:35,285 --> 00:17:37,001
and he knows when
it is time to make peace.

226
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,987
You have made peace
with the slavers?

227
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,539
<i>We offered terms.</i>

228
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:37,312
- Do not use me for your lies.
- Those men respect you.

229
00:18:37,397 --> 00:18:39,714
They respect me because
they know who I am.

230
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:41,816
- They know I am loyal.
- As do I.

231
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:44,185
I am loyal to my queen,
not you.

232
00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:46,154
If you betray her work,
you are my enemy.

233
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:49,390
I am not betraying her work.
I am trying to save her city.

234
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:51,909
You promised the slavers
they could keep slavery.

235
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:53,227
For a short time.

236
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,063
Seven years is not a
short time for a slave.

237
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,615
You're right.

238
00:18:57,701 --> 00:19:00,168
Slavery is a horror that
should be ended at once.

239
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:02,787
War is a horror that
should be ended at once.

240
00:19:02,872 --> 00:19:04,555
I can't do both today.

241
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:06,090
You are wrong
to trust these men.

242
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:09,627
I don't trust the Masters.
I trust their self-interest.

243
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:11,473
They're trustworthy
if they're convinced

244
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:13,681
that working with me
is in their self-interest.

245
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:16,634
You don't know them.
You don't understand them.

246
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,419
We are not human
in their eyes.

247
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:20,841
They look at me
and see a weapon.

248
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,890
They look at her
and see a whore.

249
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:25,776
They look at me and they see
a misshapen little beast.

250
00:19:25,862 --> 00:19:27,895
Their contempt
is their weakness.

251
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:31,482
They'll underestimate us every time and
we will use that to our advantage.

252
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:34,652
You will not use them.

253
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:37,455
They will use you.
That is what they do.

254
00:19:58,311 --> 00:20:00,228
You all right?

255
00:20:00,313 --> 00:20:03,564
Why don't you sit
and catch your breath?

256
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,634
I'm fine.

257
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:08,936
I don't think you
could ride the dragon.

258
00:20:09,022 --> 00:20:11,155
20 years ago, maybe.

259
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:13,524
- What?
- Our queen.

260
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,994
She's wild, you know.
Don't let her size fool you.

261
00:20:17,113 --> 00:20:19,831
It's hard enough for me
and I'm a young man.

262
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:23,701
You, I don't think
your heart could take it.

263
00:20:27,207 --> 00:20:29,874
Must make you angry
that our queen chose me.

264
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:33,127
Makes me sad.
You'll disappoint her before long.

265
00:20:33,213 --> 00:20:35,663
- She'll move on.
- We'll all disappoint her before long.

266
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:38,599
We need each other right now.
After we're done needing each other...

267
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:42,136
Oh, I don't want to fight you,
Jorah the Andal.

268
00:20:42,222 --> 00:20:43,938
What do I have to gain?

269
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:46,691
If I win, I'm the shit
who killed an old man.

270
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,944
If I lose, I'm the shit
who was killed by an old man.

271
00:20:51,698 --> 00:20:54,858
You didn't get much
discipline as a child, did you?

272
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:56,651
None.

273
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:05,410
The road running
through the Horse Gate,

274
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:07,328
they call that
the godsway.

275
00:21:07,414 --> 00:21:10,131
Eastern Market,
Western Market.

276
00:21:10,216 --> 00:21:14,419
When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed
to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen,

277
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:17,755
the widows
of the dead khals.

278
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:19,807
That's where they
would have taken her,

279
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:23,094
<i>the Temple
of the Dosh Khaleen.</i>

280
00:21:31,187 --> 00:21:32,720
What are you doing?

281
00:21:32,822 --> 00:21:35,356
It's forbidden to carry
weapons in the sacred city.

282
00:21:35,442 --> 00:21:38,860
Isn't it forbidden to sneak into
their city and steal their khaleesi?

283
00:21:38,945 --> 00:21:40,828
If they spot us
and we're unarmed,

284
00:21:40,914 --> 00:21:43,397
we'll say we're traders heading
for the Western Market.

285
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,116
But if they see
weapons...

286
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:46,918
You're asking a dog
to hand over his teeth.

287
00:21:47,036 --> 00:21:49,036
There's 100,000
of them down there.

288
00:21:49,122 --> 00:21:50,621
We can't fight our way out.

289
00:21:50,707 --> 00:21:53,458
We wait till dark,
and then we'll find her.

290
00:22:00,216 --> 00:22:02,133
Uh...

291
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,521
I'm very attached
to this knife.

292
00:22:17,283 --> 00:22:19,901
Don't worry.
It didn't touch you.

293
00:22:21,404 --> 00:22:23,488
You know what happens?

294
00:22:23,573 --> 00:22:25,289
I know what happens.

295
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,043
I'll do it myself.

296
00:23:01,411 --> 00:23:04,278
I should have been
born a Dothraki.

297
00:23:32,025 --> 00:23:35,059
Come on.

298
00:24:52,388 --> 00:24:55,356
Told you,
I'm very attached to this knife.

299
00:24:56,893 --> 00:24:58,425
You all right?

300
00:24:58,528 --> 00:25:00,695
If they find a body
with a stab wound,

301
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,147
the whole city
will be looking for us.

302
00:25:24,587 --> 00:25:25,587
Huh.

303
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:58,012
Mm-hmm.

304
00:27:13,663 --> 00:27:15,830
- No, don't hurt her.
- She'll give us away.

305
00:27:15,915 --> 00:27:17,665
We have to go now.

306
00:27:22,455 --> 00:27:25,172
We will never get out
of Vaes Dothrak alive.

307
00:27:25,258 --> 00:27:27,675
All we can do is try.

308
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,960
No.

309
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:32,263
We can do more than that.

310
00:27:32,381 --> 00:27:33,964
And you're going
to help me.

311
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:47,104
If I were to let you leave right now,
where would you go?

312
00:28:47,206 --> 00:28:49,874
<i>What would you seek out?</i>

313
00:28:51,794 --> 00:28:54,328
I'd go to my brother,

314
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,880
my husband, my family.

315
00:28:55,965 --> 00:29:00,100
Of course, but for you,
that means seeking out money,

316
00:29:00,186 --> 00:29:03,053
finery, power.

317
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:06,974
Seeking out your family
means seeking out sin.

318
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:08,976
<i>I'm not maligning you.</i>

319
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:12,012
I sought
those things out, too.

320
00:29:12,114 --> 00:29:14,315
To the exclusion
of all else.

321
00:29:16,152 --> 00:29:17,952
<i>My father was a cobbler.</i>

322
00:29:18,037 --> 00:29:22,206
He died when I was young
and I took over his shop.

323
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:24,825
He was a simple man
and he made simple shoes.

324
00:29:24,911 --> 00:29:28,329
But I found that the more
work I put into my shoes,

325
00:29:28,414 --> 00:29:29,630
the more people
wanted them.

326
00:29:29,715 --> 00:29:32,800
Fine leather,
ornamentation,

327
00:29:32,885 --> 00:29:36,754
detailing,
and time.

328
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,555
Time most of all.

329
00:29:38,674 --> 00:29:41,258
Dozens of hours
spent on a single pair.

330
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:43,093
Quality takes time.

331
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:45,145
Yes.

332
00:29:45,231 --> 00:29:47,314
I imagine
you've worn a year

333
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,384
of someone's life
on your back.

334
00:29:50,486 --> 00:29:52,820
<i>The highborn liked to cover
their feet with my time</i>

335
00:29:52,905 --> 00:29:55,906
and they paid well
for the privilege.

336
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:57,574
I used their money

337
00:29:57,693 --> 00:30:00,411
to buy a taste of their
lives for myself.

338
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:02,663
<i>Each time I indulged,</i>

339
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:06,867
I felt myself ascending
to something better.

340
00:30:06,953 --> 00:30:08,953
And one day you walked
through a graveyard

341
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:10,754
and realized it was
all for nothing

342
00:30:10,873 --> 00:30:13,407
and set out on the path
to righteousness.

343
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:16,093
Book of the Stranger,
verse 25.

344
00:30:16,212 --> 00:30:18,745
You know
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

345
00:30:18,848 --> 00:30:21,515
Septa Unella reads it to me.
At me.

346
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,436
Yes, yes, she does enjoy
reading at people.

347
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:28,555
You're close.

348
00:30:29,692 --> 00:30:31,725
But it wasn't
a graveyard.

349
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:33,644
It was a feast.

350
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:36,030
I bought old fine wine

351
00:30:36,115 --> 00:30:38,148
and young pretty girls

352
00:30:38,234 --> 00:30:41,952
and invited my friends
to come and share it all.

353
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:45,456
<i>We passed around the wine,
passed around the women,</i>

354
00:30:45,574 --> 00:30:48,292
<i>and soon we fell
into a stupor.</i>

355
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,381
I woke before dawn.

356
00:30:54,467 --> 00:30:57,617
I could barely stand.

357
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,456
Everyone else was asleep on
the couches or on the floor,

358
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:07,177
lying in heaps next
to their fine clothes.

359
00:31:07,263 --> 00:31:09,730
The truth of their bodies
laid bare.

360
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:14,634
I could smell them

361
00:31:14,737 --> 00:31:18,072
beneath the incense
and the perfume

362
00:31:18,157 --> 00:31:21,859
and the fine food that had
already started to turn.

363
00:31:23,996 --> 00:31:27,197
And I saw it
with perfect clarity.

364
00:31:28,284 --> 00:31:30,617
I saw what my sins were.

365
00:31:32,121 --> 00:31:34,988
The gold I had, the wine I drank,
the women I used,

366
00:31:35,091 --> 00:31:39,293
my ceaseless struggle
to maintain my position.

367
00:31:43,966 --> 00:31:46,216
It was all part
of a story.

368
00:31:48,637 --> 00:31:51,688
A story I was telling
myself about who I was.

369
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:54,274
<i>A collection of lies</i>

370
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,343
<i>that would disappear
in the light.</i>

371
00:31:56,445 --> 00:32:00,347
The people I was trying
to climb away from,

372
00:32:00,449 --> 00:32:01,899
the beggars
in the street,

373
00:32:02,017 --> 00:32:03,534
<i>the poor,</i>

374
00:32:03,652 --> 00:32:07,404
they were closer to the
truth than I ever was.

375
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,040
So what did you do?

376
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,025
<i>I left to go
and find them.</i>

377
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:15,712
I didn't even
put on my shoes.

378
00:32:15,831 --> 00:32:19,716
I walked out the door
and never went back.

379
00:32:25,474 --> 00:32:27,424
Come, let's go and see him.

380
00:32:28,644 --> 00:32:30,928
- Who?
- Your brother.

381
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:48,278
Loras.

382
00:32:54,703 --> 00:32:56,804
Loras.

383
00:33:15,691 --> 00:33:17,558
Listen to me.

384
00:33:17,643 --> 00:33:19,526
You need to stay strong.

385
00:33:22,948 --> 00:33:25,432
I can't stay strong.

386
00:33:25,534 --> 00:33:27,284
I never was strong.

387
00:33:27,403 --> 00:33:29,153
You are strong.

388
00:33:29,238 --> 00:33:31,605
You are the future
of our house,

389
00:33:31,707 --> 00:33:33,106
the future
of our family.

390
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:35,775
- I don't care about that.
- Shh!

391
00:33:35,878 --> 00:33:37,628
Shh.

392
00:33:37,746 --> 00:33:39,997
Have you...
have you told them that?

393
00:33:40,082 --> 00:33:41,582
That you don't care?

394
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:45,669
I just want it to stop.

395
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,923
Help me.

396
00:33:56,482 --> 00:33:59,266
They want me
to help you.

397
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:03,353
They want me to help
tear you down.

398
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:06,440
That's why he's letting me see you.
I know it is.

399
00:34:06,525 --> 00:34:10,194
And if either of us give in to
what they want, then they win.

400
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:11,995
Let them win.

401
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:15,415
Just make it stop.

402
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:17,701
Please.

403
00:34:18,954 --> 00:34:21,255
All right.

404
00:34:25,794 --> 00:34:29,630
<i>And now, how to avert disaster
with our current predicament.</i>

405
00:34:29,715 --> 00:34:31,882
<i>This High Sparrow.</i>

406
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:34,968
<i>I have dealt with fanatics of
every description, Your Grace.</i>

407
00:34:35,054 --> 00:34:38,689
Not setting them off,
that's the most important thing.

408
00:34:38,807 --> 00:34:42,008
You are beset with enemies
both within and without.

409
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:43,777
What are you doing here?

410
00:34:46,482 --> 00:34:49,900
I am advising the king
on our current predicament.

411
00:34:49,985 --> 00:34:53,370
- Leave.
- I am a member of the small council.

412
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:54,705
The king...

413
00:34:54,823 --> 00:34:57,441
Is this a small
council meeting?

414
00:34:57,543 --> 00:34:58,825
Obviously not.

415
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:02,028
I'm here to lend my
wisdom and my support.

416
00:35:02,131 --> 00:35:05,365
Thank you for your counsel,
Grand Maester.

417
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:07,387
That will be all
for now.

418
00:35:07,469 --> 00:35:09,219
Your Grace.

419
00:35:33,028 --> 00:35:36,563
Since I've missed the past
several small council meetings,

420
00:35:36,665 --> 00:35:39,416
I wanted to speak to you
about a few things.

421
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,420
I've been thinking
about the High Sparrow.

422
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:46,206
As have we all,
unfortunately.

423
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:49,209
We need to be careful
in dealing with such a man.

424
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:53,096
To prevent things from
escalating any further.

425
00:35:55,217 --> 00:35:57,467
We have to be careful
not to antagonize him.

426
00:35:57,553 --> 00:35:59,970
He has Margaery.
We can't put her at risk.

427
00:36:00,055 --> 00:36:02,806
- He's dangerous.
- Look at me.

428
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,758
What did they do to me?

429
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,777
To the king's own mother?

430
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:13,984
It's all right.

431
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:16,536
It's done.
It's in the past.

432
00:36:16,622 --> 00:36:18,872
And of course

433
00:36:18,957 --> 00:36:21,658
Margaery's safety
is paramount.

434
00:36:23,045 --> 00:36:26,913
You don't
like Margaery, do you?

435
00:36:28,634 --> 00:36:31,752
Whether I like her or not
is completely unimportant.

436
00:36:34,223 --> 00:36:35,806
Margaery is the queen.

437
00:36:37,426 --> 00:36:40,510
Queens must command respect.
Kings even more so.

438
00:36:40,596 --> 00:36:43,430
Not just for their own sake,
but for everyone's.

439
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:48,819
The High Sparrow has no
respect for kings or queens.

440
00:36:48,937 --> 00:36:50,771
No respect for anything
in this world.

441
00:36:50,856 --> 00:36:53,774
<i>He has no use for the
things of this world.</i>

442
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:57,494
He wants to knock them down
and replace them with what?

443
00:36:57,613 --> 00:36:59,696
With fantasies.

444
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:01,815
<i>With beggars
in the street.</i>

445
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:03,116
With nothing.

446
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,670
Mother...

447
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,610
there's something
I want to tell you.

448
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:13,710
Something the High
Sparrow told me.

449
00:37:16,515 --> 00:37:18,215
You've spoken with him?

450
00:37:20,185 --> 00:37:23,637
I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone.
If he found out I told...

451
00:37:23,722 --> 00:37:26,523
It would be a breach of confidence
which he would not take lightly

452
00:37:26,642 --> 00:37:29,393
given his constant
prattling about the truth.

453
00:37:32,614 --> 00:37:35,031
I am your mother.

454
00:37:36,068 --> 00:37:38,118
You can always trust me.

455
00:37:46,128 --> 00:37:49,529
The small council meeting has been
postponed on the king's orders.

456
00:37:49,631 --> 00:37:51,991
I would have thought we were
perfectly clear the first time.

457
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:55,135
<i>- You're not welcome.</i>
- You once spoke of your respect for our father

458
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,971
because he understood the necessity
of working with one's rivals.

459
00:37:58,056 --> 00:38:02,893
My dear, you have been stripped
of your dignity and authority,

460
00:38:03,011 --> 00:38:06,012
publically shamed,
and confined to the Red Keep.

461
00:38:06,098 --> 00:38:08,348
What's left to work with?

462
00:38:08,434 --> 00:38:10,851
<i>Cersei is the mother
of the king.</i>

463
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:13,653
She has the king's ear
and his trust.

464
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:15,689
And the king has been
speaking regularly

465
00:38:15,774 --> 00:38:19,192
with the High Sparrow about
Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.

466
00:38:19,278 --> 00:38:20,911
The High Sparrow
seized power

467
00:38:21,029 --> 00:38:22,996
knowing full well we'd
bicker amongst ourselves

468
00:38:23,081 --> 00:38:24,781
instead of
seizing it back.

469
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:26,700
Here we are.
Well done to us.

470
00:38:26,785 --> 00:38:28,902
Now the future
of the Seven Kingdoms

471
00:38:28,987 --> 00:38:30,837
rests in his dirty
peasant hands.

472
00:38:30,923 --> 00:38:33,707
In a few days, he'll have
a trial for me.

473
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:37,377
But before that, Queen Margaery
will make her walk of atonement.

474
00:38:37,463 --> 00:38:41,080
Yes, Margaery
will repent her sins

475
00:38:41,183 --> 00:38:43,133
before the good people
of the city.

476
00:38:43,218 --> 00:38:45,719
Oh, no.

477
00:38:45,804 --> 00:38:48,605
That cannot happen.

478
00:38:48,724 --> 00:38:50,524
That will not happen.

479
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:52,275
I agree.

480
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:57,814
You've got the second
largest army in Westeros.

481
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,366
You'll bring them
into the city,

482
00:38:59,451 --> 00:39:02,118
stop Queen Margaery's
humiliation before it starts,

483
00:39:02,237 --> 00:39:04,621
and take her back
into Crown custody.

484
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,458
The king has ordered me to take no
action against the High Sparrow

485
00:39:08,577 --> 00:39:11,661
or the Faith Militant out of
fear for the queen's safety.

486
00:39:11,747 --> 00:39:13,613
You will take
no action at all.

487
00:39:13,715 --> 00:39:16,249
When the Tyrell armies come,
you will stand down.

488
00:39:16,335 --> 00:39:20,003
<i>Are you expressly forbidden
from standing down?</i>

489
00:39:20,088 --> 00:39:22,973
No, but if the king
should call...

490
00:39:23,091 --> 00:39:25,842
The whole thing will be over before
anyone can call on you to do anything.

491
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:30,096
When the High Sparrow is in
custody or dead, preferably,

492
00:39:30,182 --> 00:39:32,732
and Margaery's back
at Tommen's side,

493
00:39:32,818 --> 00:39:34,978
do you think the king
will be angry at the outcome?

494
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,771
You hate these fanatics
as much as we do.

495
00:39:37,856 --> 00:39:41,140
You hate what they've
done to your son.

496
00:39:41,243 --> 00:39:43,109
Do you want Lancel back?

497
00:39:43,195 --> 00:39:45,675
Or have you given
him up for good?

498
00:39:46,865 --> 00:39:49,115
Of course
I want him back.

499
00:39:52,504 --> 00:39:54,120
Then stand aside

500
00:39:54,206 --> 00:39:57,424
and let the people that took
him from you be destroyed.

501
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:02,796
If it doesn't
go as planned,

502
00:40:02,881 --> 00:40:05,265
the sparrows have
many friends in this city.

503
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:08,101
<i>We'll have civil war.
Many will die.</i>

504
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:10,604
Many will die
no matter what we do.

505
00:40:12,357 --> 00:40:14,107
Better them than us.

506
00:41:10,532 --> 00:41:12,916
They told me you were home
and I didn't believe it.

507
00:41:15,003 --> 00:41:17,737
"Theon Greyjoy?"
I said.

508
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,173
"He's dead.

509
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:22,658
He's been dead
a long time."

510
00:41:25,764 --> 00:41:27,747
He let you go?

511
00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:29,299
I escaped.

512
00:41:31,853 --> 00:41:33,687
I can't hear you.

513
00:41:33,772 --> 00:41:35,438
I escaped.

514
00:41:37,776 --> 00:41:39,559
Look at me.

515
00:41:48,236 --> 00:41:49,619
Look at me.

516
00:41:51,073 --> 00:41:53,740
Men died trying
to rescue you.

517
00:41:53,825 --> 00:41:55,441
Good men.

518
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:56,993
My men.

519
00:41:58,463 --> 00:42:00,113
I'm sorry.

520
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:02,248
You were my brother.

521
00:42:02,334 --> 00:42:05,385
You were a spoiled little cunt,
but you were my brother

522
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,453
and I risked
everything for you

523
00:42:07,556 --> 00:42:08,922
and you betrayed me.

524
00:42:09,007 --> 00:42:11,174
I know.
I know and I'm sorry.

525
00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:12,592
Stop saying that.

526
00:42:13,645 --> 00:42:14,894
He broke me.

527
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,681
He broke me
into 1,000 pieces.

528
00:42:17,766 --> 00:42:19,149
- I know.
- You don't know.

529
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:21,768
He sent us
one of those pieces.

530
00:42:21,853 --> 00:42:23,820
That's why
I came for you.

531
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:31,778
Why did you come here?

532
00:42:31,863 --> 00:42:33,479
Where else could I go?

533
00:42:33,582 --> 00:42:37,283
You heard Father was dead and you
thought you'd claim the crown?

534
00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:39,335
No, no. I only heard he
died after we docked.

535
00:42:39,454 --> 00:42:42,338
You happen to show up on Pyke
right before the kingsmoot?

536
00:42:42,457 --> 00:42:43,923
I didn't know.

537
00:42:46,928 --> 00:42:50,130
You think any ironborn
wants you to be king

538
00:42:50,215 --> 00:42:52,015
after what you've done?

539
00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:54,100
I don't want
to be king.

540
00:42:54,186 --> 00:42:57,437
What do you want?

541
00:42:57,522 --> 00:42:59,602
I should have listened to you.
You're the only one...

542
00:42:59,641 --> 00:43:02,008
That doesn't matter anymore.
Stop crying.

543
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:04,110
Look at me.

544
00:43:04,196 --> 00:43:07,363
Tell me what you want.

545
00:43:11,737 --> 00:43:14,404
You should rule
the Iron Islands.

546
00:43:15,657 --> 00:43:17,657
Let me help you.

547
00:43:44,352 --> 00:43:46,486
They've cleaned
you up nicely.

548
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,490
You know who I am?

549
00:43:52,077 --> 00:43:53,276
A lord.

550
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:55,328
Yes.

551
00:43:55,413 --> 00:43:57,997
A lord.

552
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:00,033
You've seen my banners?

553
00:44:01,369 --> 00:44:03,503
The flayed man.

554
00:44:03,588 --> 00:44:06,422
Does that worry
you at all?

555
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:08,041
You eat them after?

556
00:44:11,713 --> 00:44:12,929
No.

557
00:44:13,048 --> 00:44:16,049
Then I've seen worse.

558
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:42,242
You served the Starks?

559
00:44:42,327 --> 00:44:44,878
Aye.
They put me in chains

560
00:44:44,963 --> 00:44:46,830
and put a sword
at my throat,

561
00:44:46,915 --> 00:44:48,214
so I served them.

562
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,668
The Starks have been
gone for a long time,

563
00:44:51,753 --> 00:44:54,554
but you kept
protecting Rickon.

564
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:58,141
He'd fetch a good price
to the right buyer.

565
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,060
I served his family
a long time.

566
00:45:00,095 --> 00:45:02,262
Didn't get no wages.

567
00:45:02,347 --> 00:45:05,481
Way I see it,
I'm owed.

568
00:45:07,602 --> 00:45:10,236
Be that as it may,

569
00:45:10,322 --> 00:45:12,805
Rickon's not yours
to sell anymore.

570
00:45:12,908 --> 00:45:14,574
He's mine.

571
00:45:14,659 --> 00:45:17,694
So what use could I
possibly have for you?

572
00:45:20,115 --> 00:45:22,448
I can give you
what you want.

573
00:45:22,534 --> 00:45:24,784
And you're sure
you know what that is?

574
00:45:26,371 --> 00:45:29,873
Same thing
men always want.

575
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:34,177
And when they really want it,
they give it a bath first.

576
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:44,771
You're a good talker.

577
00:45:47,025 --> 00:45:48,892
I like that.

578
00:45:56,484 --> 00:46:00,203
You're a much better talker
than Theon Greyjoy.

579
00:46:01,623 --> 00:46:03,406
That so?

580
00:46:03,491 --> 00:46:05,825
I had to work hard
to get him talking.

581
00:46:05,911 --> 00:46:08,411
But he talked.

582
00:46:08,496 --> 00:46:10,196
They all do.

583
00:46:10,298 --> 00:46:13,049
He told me everything.

584
00:46:13,168 --> 00:46:16,002
All about the Stark boys,

585
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:18,338
who helped them escape,

586
00:46:18,423 --> 00:46:19,756
and how she did it.

587
00:46:48,203 --> 00:46:50,119
<i>Open the gate!</i>

588
00:47:37,168 --> 00:47:39,285
Sorry about the food.

589
00:47:39,387 --> 00:47:41,421
It's not what
we're known for.

590
00:47:41,506 --> 00:47:43,973
That's all right.
There are more important things.

591
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,813
A letter for you,
Lord Commander.

592
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,517
I'm not Lord
Commander anymore.

593
00:48:14,456 --> 00:48:17,006
"To the traitor
and bastard Jon Snow.

594
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:20,343
You allowed thousands
of wildlings past the Wall.

595
00:48:20,462 --> 00:48:21,928
You have betrayed
your own kind.

596
00:48:22,013 --> 00:48:23,880
You have betrayed
the North.

597
00:48:23,965 --> 00:48:27,133
Winterfell is mine, bastard.
Come and see.

598
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,803
Your brother Rickon
is in my dungeon.

599
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:41,481
His direwolf's skin
is on my floor.

600
00:48:41,566 --> 00:48:43,900
Come and see.
I want my bride back.

601
00:48:43,985 --> 00:48:47,737
Send her to me, bastard, and I will not
trouble you or your wildling lovers.

602
00:48:47,822 --> 00:48:50,957
Keep her from me and I will
ride north and slaughter

603
00:48:51,042 --> 00:48:54,544
<i>every wildling man, woman, and
babe living under your protection.</i>

604
00:48:54,662 --> 00:48:58,081
You will watch as I skin them living.
You..."

605
00:49:00,418 --> 00:49:02,051
Go on.

606
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:03,970
It's just more
of the same.

607
00:49:08,843 --> 00:49:12,428
"You will watch as my soldiers
take turns raping your sister.

608
00:49:13,932 --> 00:49:15,231
<i>You will watch
as my dogs</i>

609
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:17,934
devour your wild
little brother.

610
00:49:19,988 --> 00:49:23,573
Then I will spoon your eyes from their
sockets and let my dogs do the rest.

611
00:49:23,691 --> 00:49:27,610
Come and see.
Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell

612
00:49:27,695 --> 00:49:29,445
and Warden of the North."

613
00:49:33,001 --> 00:49:36,919
Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North.

614
00:49:37,038 --> 00:49:39,922
His father's dead.

615
00:49:40,041 --> 00:49:41,574
Ramsay killed him.

616
00:49:41,676 --> 00:49:44,043
- <i>And now he has Rickon.</i>
- We don't know that.

617
00:49:44,129 --> 00:49:46,546
Yes, we do.

618
00:49:46,631 --> 00:49:49,132
How many men does
he have in his army?

619
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:54,937
I heard him say 5,000 once when he
was talking about Stannis's attack.

620
00:49:55,056 --> 00:49:57,423
How many do you have?

621
00:49:57,525 --> 00:50:00,476
That can march and fight?

622
00:50:00,562 --> 00:50:02,311
2,000.

623
00:50:03,615 --> 00:50:06,315
The rest are children
and old people.

624
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:13,956
You're the son of the last
true Warden of the North.

625
00:50:14,075 --> 00:50:17,710
Northern families are loyal.
They'll fight for you if you ask.

626
00:50:19,831 --> 00:50:24,050
A monster has taken
our home and our brother.

627
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:28,471
We have to go back to
Winterfell and save them both.
