00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:30,097
I DON'T CARE
HOW DEEPLY IN DEBT
THIS FESTIVAL IS.

183
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,533
I WANT A PARADE.

184
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:33,665
I WANT HOT DOGS,
BALLOONS,
THE WHOLE SCHMEER.

185
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:37,931
WE'LL CELEBRATE
THIS 200th ANNIVERSARY
PROUDLY AND PUBLICLY.

186
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:42,022
THIS FESTIVAL
IS $250,000 IN THE RED,

187
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:43,284
AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN
ONE BALLOON.

188
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:45,373
FILL THIS SQUARE
WITH PEOPLE.

189
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,331
THE BUSINESSES
WILL COME BACK.

190
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,029
A LOT OF PEOPLE
MIGHT STAY AWAY.

191
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:50,160
THEY'RE SCARED.

192
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:51,814
THEY WON'T BE SCARED

193
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:53,337
WHEN GRISSOM'S
IN THAT COURTHOUSE.

194
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:56,036
I PROMISED THAT,
REMEMBER?

195
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,215
WELL, WELCOME,
COUNT DRACULA.

196
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:03,217
HAD ANY SIGHTINGS
OF BIGFOOT LATELY?

197
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,392
AFRAID NOT.

198
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:05,915
THEY BURIED YOUR STORY
ON BATMAN.

199
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,569
THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENS
TO GARBAGE.

200
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:09,745
THIS IS PULITZER PRIZE
STUFF, GUYS.

201
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,400
HEY, KNOX,
I GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

202
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:16,708
VERY FUNNY.

203
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:19,929
YOU SHOULD'VE HAD MORE GORE
UNDER THE FANGS, THOUGH.

204
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:21,931
WHAT A...

205
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:26,066
HELLO, LEGS.

206
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:29,809
I'M READING
YOUR STUFF.

207
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:33,029
WELL, I'M
READING YOURS.

208
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,814
HI. I'M VICKI VALE.

209
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,032
VICKI VALE.
YEAH, YEAH.

210
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:37,468
PHOTOGRAPHER. 
VOGUE, COSMO.

211
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:39,557
IF YOU WANT ME
TO POSE NUDE,

212
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:41,603
YOU'LL NEED
A LONG LENS.

213
00:13:41,646 --> 00:13:45,215
ACTUALLY, I WAS IN
THE CORTO MALTESE.

214
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:48,566
A GIRL COULD GET HURT
DOING THIS STUFF.

215
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,699
SO, UH, WHAT
BRINGS YOU HERE?

216
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:54,355
I'M HERE TO SEE
SOME WILDLIFE
IN GOTHAM CITY.

217
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:55,878
WILDLIFE?

218
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:57,445
LIKE WHAT?

219
00:13:58,315 --> 00:14:01,057
LIKE...BATS.

220
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:03,233
WHO SENT YOU?

221
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,800
NO, NOBODY.
REALLY.

222
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,236
I JUST LOVED
YOUR STORY.

223
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,284
AND I--I...
I LIKE...BATS.

224
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:12,242
YEAH?

225
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:14,070
MY PICTURES,
YOUR WORDS--

226
00:14:14,114 --> 00:14:15,158
PULITZER PRIZE
MATERIAL.

227
00:14:15,202 --> 00:14:16,203
JUST THINK--

228
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:17,465
O.K. YOU'RE A VISIONARY.

229
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:19,684
YOU'RE ALSO THE ONLY ONE
WHO BELIEVES ME.

230
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:21,556
I NEED SOMETHING
TANGIBLE.

231
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,036
GORDON'S GOT
A FILE ON THIS.

232
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:25,342
I CAN'T EVEN GET HIM
ON THE PHONE.

233
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:27,605
BRUCE WAYNE'S BENEFIT--
HE'LL BE THERE?

234
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:30,913
YEAH, YEAH.
I DON'T SEEM TO BE
ON THE GUEST LIST.

235
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:33,611
NO...NO.

236
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:35,700
YES. YES.

237
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:36,788
VALE, WILL YOU
MARRY ME?

238
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:38,355
NOPE.

239
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,530
WILL YOU
BUY ME LUNCH?

240
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:40,575
MAYBE.

241
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:41,793
I EAT LIGHT.

242
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:50,628
SAY THIS...

243
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:52,935
SON OF A--

244
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,676
MAKES A CONNECTION
WITH US

245
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,939
AND WITH AXIS CHEMICALS.

246
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:59,028
WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE
ARE WE LOOKING AT?

247
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:00,638
IF HE TIES US IN
WITH AXIS CHEMICAL,

248
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:02,510
WE'RE DEAD AND BURIED.

249
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:05,252
WE SHOULD MOVE
IMMEDIATELY.

250
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:08,255
I SAY WE BREAK
INTO THE PLACE,

251
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:10,605
TRASH THE OFFICE,

252
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:12,128
AND MAKE OFF
WITH THE RECORDS

253
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:14,957
AND SAY
IT WAS INDUSTRIAL
ESPIONAGE.

254
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:18,395
JACK...SMART THINKING.

255
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:20,702
THAT'S THE WAY TO GO,
IN FACT.

256
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:25,968
I'D LIKE YOU TO HANDLE
THIS OPERATION PERSONALLY.

257
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:27,448
ME?

258
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:35,151
HELLO, SWEETHEART.

259
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:38,111
I WONDER IF
YOU'D MIND WAITING
IN THE NEXT ROOM?

260
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:52,952
THAT'S ALL, GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU.

261
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,040
THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.

262
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,315
CARL, UH...

263
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:10,360
CAN WE GET SOMEBODY
ELSE TO DO THIS?

264
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:14,712
I MEAN, THE FUMES
IN THAT PLACE...

265
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:16,366
JACK...

266
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:18,847
IT'S AN IMPORTANT JOB.

267
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:23,199
I NEED...
SOMEONE I CAN TRUST.

268
00:16:23,243 --> 00:16:25,506
YOU ARE
MY NUMBER ONE GUY.

269
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,076
NOW...

270
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,166
DON'T FORGET...

271
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,561
YOUR LUCKY DECK.

272
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,053
MY FRIEND...

273
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:53,708
YOUR LUCK
IS ABOUT TO CHANGE.

274
00:16:57,842 --> 00:16:59,322
POLICE
DEPARTMENT.

275
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:02,151
GET ME LIEUTENANT ECKHARDT.

276
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:46,282
CAN I HELP YOU,
SIR?

277
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:47,936
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

278
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:48,850
THAT'S VERY NICE
OF YOU.

279
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:51,722
HOLD ON.
HERE YOU GO.

280
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:03,473
GOOD EVENING,
MA'AM.

281
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:05,258
A LITTLE CROWDED.

282
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:12,613
EXCUSE ME.

283
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:13,744
EXCUSE ME.

284
00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:15,616

EXCUSE ME.

285
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:19,141
COULD YOU TELL ME
WHICH GUY IS BRUCE WAYNE?

286
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:21,361
WELL, I'M NOT SURE.

287
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:23,363
THANKS ANYWAY.

288
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:25,495
YEAH.

289
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,454
HUH? OH, CERTAINLY.

290
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:54,524
YOUR ROLL,
COMMISSIONER.

291
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:55,917
THANK YOU.

292
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,961
HERE WE GO.

293
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:59,964
8. 8!
I CAN MAKE THAT 8.

294
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:01,444
I CAN MAKE THAT 8.

295
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:02,837
PLACE YOUR BETS,
PLEASE.

296
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,841
COMMISSIONER!
MRS. GORDON,
YOU LOOK LOVELY.

297
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:09,713
IS IT TRUE
THE COMMISSIONER HAS
A FILE ON THE BATMAN?

298
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:11,193
THERE IS NO BAT.

299
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:12,716
IF THERE WERE,
WE WOULD ARREST HIM.

300
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,066
WOULD YOU CONFIRM HIM?

301
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,677
HOW YOU
MAKING OUT?

302
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,765
NO GOOD AT ALL.

303
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:19,375
MR. DENT,
I LOVE THAT TIE.

304
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:22,683
GORDO AND I
WERE DISCUSSING
WINGED VIGILANTES.

305
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:24,380
WHAT'S YOUR STAND?

306
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:26,339
MR. KNOX, WE HAVE ENOUGH
PROBLEMS IN THIS CITY

307
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:29,994
WITHOUT WORRYING
ABOUT GHOSTS AND GOBLINS.

308
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:31,170
THAT'S NOT A DENIAL.

309
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:35,696
EXCUSE ME, DEAR.
I'LL BE BACK.

310
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:37,480
WON'T ANYBODY
GO ON RECORD?

311
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:39,134
UH, YOUR HONOR,
GREAT SUIT.

312
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,788
NO COMMENT.

313
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:43,138
ROBERT, WHAT'S UP?

314
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,574
ANONYMOUS TIP.

315
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:48,230
NAPIER'S CLEANING OUT
AXIS CHEMICALS.

316
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:50,624
IT'S FUNNY
THAT THE OWNERS
NEVER...

317
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:56,847
WHY WASN'T I TOLD?
WHO'S IN CHARGE?

318
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:58,458
ECKHARDT, SIR.

319
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:00,242
OH, MY GOD.

320
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:01,591
COME ON, LET'S GO.

321
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:14,343
COMMISSIONER GORDON.

322
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:21,481
HEY.

323
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:22,873
OOH HOO HOO!

324
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,005
WAIT A MINUTE.

325
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:27,878
LIVING ROOM,
DINING ROOM, ARSENAL.

326
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:30,098
LOOK AT THIS STUFF.

327
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:32,361
WHO IS THIS GUY?

328
00:20:32,405 --> 00:20:34,972
HE GIVES TO ALL THESE
HUMANITARIAN CAUSES

329
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:37,453
AND THEN COLLECTS
ALL THIS STUFF.

330
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:38,933
HE PROBABLY DOES IT
TO GET CHICKS.

331
00:20:38,976 --> 00:20:41,414
THEY LIKE HIM FOR
HIS BIG CHARITY BALLS.

332
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:44,243
YEAH, AND DON'T
LEAVE OUT HIS VERY
LARGE BANKROLL.

333
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,984
REMEMBER,
THE MORE THEY'VE GOT,
THE LESS THEY'RE WORTH.

334
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:48,551
THEN THIS GUY
MUST BE

335
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:50,858
THE MOST WORTHLESS
GUY IN AMERICA.

336
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:52,207
CHECK THIS OUT.

337
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,602
HE MUST HAVE BEEN
KING OF THE WICKER PEOPLE.

338
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:59,432
OH, OH,
WHERE'D THIS COME FROM?

339
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:01,390
I HAVE NO IDEA.

340
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,567
IT'S JAPANESE.

341
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:06,874
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

342
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:09,572
BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT
IN JAPAN.

343
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:10,921
WHO ARE YOU?

344
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:13,707
OH, SORRY.
BRUCE WAYNE.

345
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,448
ALEXANDER KNOX.

346
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:16,971
HI.

347
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:19,190
I READ YOUR WORK.
I LIKE IT.

348
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:21,671
OH, THANKS.
CAN I HAVE A GRANT?

349
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:23,456
VICKI VALE.

350
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:25,893
HI. BRUCE WAYNE.

351
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:27,808
ARE YOU SURE?

352
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:29,244
YEAH. THIS TIME.

353
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,332
I'VE SEEN
YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS

354
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:32,421
FROM CORTO MALTESE,
HAVEN'T I?

355
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:33,683
RIGHT.

356
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,729
YEAH, YOU'VE GOT
A WONDERFUL EYE.

357
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:38,427
SOME PEOPLE
THINK SHE HAS TWO.

358
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:40,299
THIS IS
AN AMAZING HOUSE.

359
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,344
I'D LIKE TO

00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:43,693

00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:13,680

FOR A LIVING?

376
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:15,116
WELL, I'M INVOLVED--

377
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,988

00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,751
GET UP ON THE CATWALK
ON THAT SIDE.

429
00:27:45,794 --> 00:27:47,143

INTO THE ACID?

A HARD TIME

YOUNG MASTER BRUCE

LEADING HIS GRAY PONY,
WITH ME ON ITS BACK

489
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:40,523
LIKE A SACK
OF OLD POTATOES,

COVERED IN MUD
AND NURSING
A SPRAINED ANKLE.

A RIDING LESSON.

00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:22,435
OH? WERE YOU
CLOSE TO HIM?

00:33:22,478 --> 00:33:24,263
YEAH. I USED
TO SPEND SUMMERS

508
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:25,829

AND MY GRANDMOTHER.

509

ISN'T.

CONCERNED PEOPLE ARE
ABOUT APPEARANCES.

01:04:33,826 --> 01:04:37,569

01:04:37,612 --> 01:04:39,223
WELL, THAT
IS ALL BEHIND ME.

01:04:39,266 --> 01:04:41,965

WHAT OTHER PEOPLE
ONLY DREAM.

961
01:04:42,008 --> 01:04:43,662
I MAKE ART...

962
01:04:43,705 --> 01:04:45,751

963
01:04:45,794 --> 01:04:47,013

01:04:48,058 --> 01:04:50,016

972
01:05:09,949 --> 01:05:12,299

974
01:05:13,387 --> 01:05:15,172

01:05:16,477 --> 01:05:19,002

WITH A PIECE I DID.

977
01:05:19,045 --> 01:05:20,220

978
01:05:20,264 --> 01:05:21,700

979
01:05:21,743 --> 01:05:24,921
YOU WILL TAKE PICTURES
AND RECORD MY WORK.

980
01:05:24,964 --> 01:05:27,097
YOU WILL JOIN ME
IN THE AVANT-GARDE...

981
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:28,663

982
01:05:28,707 --> 01:05:31,884
JACK, YOU SAID
I COULD WATCH YOU

983
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,104
IMPROVE
THE PAINTINGS.

984
01:05:34,147 --> 01:05:37,194
OH, I'M IN TROUBLE NOW.

985
01:05:37,237 --> 01:05:40,110
WHY IS SHE
WEARING A MASK?

986
01:05:40,153 --> 01:05:41,981
WELL, SHE'S JUST
A SKETCH, REALLY.

987
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:43,852

988
01:05:43,896 --> 01:05:45,985

WHY YOU WEAR THE MASK.

989
01:05:46,029 --> 01:05:48,161
YOU SEE, ALICIA'S
BEEN MADE OVER

990
01:05:48,205 --> 01:05:50,163
IN LINE WITH
MY NEW PHILOSOPHY.

991
01:05:50,207 --> 01:05:51,904

992
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,819
SHE'S A LIVING
WORK OF ART.

993
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:01,087
WHY, I'M NO PICASSO,

994
01:06:01,131 --> 01:06:03,002
BUT DO YOU LIKE IT?

995
01:06:03,046 --> 01:06:05,004
IT'S GREAT.

996
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:06,571
SO...

997
01:06:06,614 --> 01:06:08,399
WHAT CAN IDO
FOR YOU?

998
01:06:08,442 --> 01:06:11,619
OH, A LITTLE SONG,
A LITTLE DANCE,

999
01:06:11,663 --> 01:06:14,100
BATMAN'S HEAD
ON A LANCE.

1000
01:06:14,144 --> 01:06:16,407
TELL ME,
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT...

1001
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:19,366
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT BATMAN.

1002
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:22,152
REALLY?

1003
01:06:22,195 --> 01:06:25,416
WELL, HOW ABOUT
A LITTLE YOU AND ME?

1004
01:06:27,461 --> 01:06:28,897
YOU'RE INSANE.

1005
01:06:28,941 --> 01:06:30,203

I WAS A PISCES.

01:06:30,247 --> 01:06:32,205

LET'S MAKE UP.

1007
01:06:32,249 --> 01:06:35,382

OH, I'M MELTING!

1013
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,742

LET'S GO.

1030
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:13,932
SHIELDS.

1031
01:09:27,075 --> 01:09:28,164
AAH!

1032
01:09:35,519 --> 01:09:36,911
OH. AAH!

1033
01:09:39,305 --> 01:09:41,264
HOW MUCH DO YOU WEIGH?

1034
01:09:41,307 --> 01:09:42,830
ABOUT 108, I THINK.

1035
01:09:51,752 --> 01:09:53,493
HOLD ON.

1036
01:10:02,023 --> 01:10:03,286
AAH! OOH!

1037
01:10:03,329 --> 01:10:06,027
SEE THAT THING
ON MY BELT? GRAB IT.

1038
01:10:06,071 --> 01:10:07,768
DON'T LET GO.

1039
01:10:07,812 --> 01:10:11,511
AAH!

1040
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:23,262
NO BLOOD.

1041
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:25,003
HEY, WHO IS THIS GUY?

1042
01:10:25,046 --> 01:10:27,745
CHECK HIS WALLET.

1043
01:10:27,788 --> 01:10:29,616
WAIT A MINUTE.

1044
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:30,922
WHAT IS THAT?

1045
01:10:30,965 --> 01:10:32,880
IT'S SOME KIND
OF BODY ARMOR.

1046
01:10:32,924 --> 01:10:34,969
HE'S HUMAN AFTER ALL.

1047
01:10:35,013 --> 01:10:37,363
TAKE OFF THE MASK.

1048
01:10:42,499 --> 01:10:44,196
SHOOT HER!

1049
01:11:02,693 --> 01:11:04,477
YAH!

1050
01:11:07,785 --> 01:11:09,482
YAH!

1051
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,068
YAH!

1052
01:11:31,983 --> 01:11:33,158
AAH!

1053
01:11:46,171 --> 01:11:47,651
SHIELDS OPEN.

1054
01:12:11,544 --> 01:12:12,545
AAH!

1055
01:12:12,589 --> 01:12:14,460
YOU WEIGH
MORE THAN 108.

1056
01:12:14,504 --> 01:12:15,461
OH, REALLY?

1057
01:12:15,505 --> 01:12:16,854
LET'S GO.

1058
01:12:20,727 --> 01:12:22,033
STOP.

1059
01:12:50,801 --> 01:12:52,977
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

1060
01:13:34,714 --> 01:13:35,759
AAH!

1061
01:14:12,056 --> 01:14:13,405
BE CAREFUL.

1062
01:14:22,022 --> 01:14:23,459
BATS.

1063
01:14:24,808 --> 01:14:26,331
THEY'RE GREAT SURVIVORS.

1064
01:14:52,313 --> 01:14:53,358
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

1065
01:14:53,401 --> 01:14:55,708
THE POLICE
HAVE GOT IT WRONG.

1066
01:14:55,752 --> 01:14:57,797
THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR ONE PRODUCT.

1067
01:14:57,841 --> 01:15:00,191
THE JOKER'S TAINTED
HUNDREDS OF CHEMICALS

1068
01:15:00,234 --> 01:15:03,194
AT THE SOURCE.

1069
01:15:03,237 --> 01:15:04,674
THEN WHOLE SHIPMENTS
OF PRODUCTS

1070
01:15:04,717 --> 01:15:06,066
WOULD BE POISONED,

1071
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:08,808
AND WE'D ALL BE DEAD.

1072
01:15:08,852 --> 01:15:11,811
NO.
THE POISON ONLY WORKS

1073
01:15:11,855 --> 01:15:13,073
WHEN THE COMPONENTS
ARE MIXED.

1074
01:15:13,117 --> 01:15:15,075
HAIRSPRAY WON'T
DO IT ALONE,

1075
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:17,295
BUT HAIRSPRAY MIXED WITH
LIPSTICK AND PERFUME

1076
01:15:17,338 --> 01:15:20,777
WOULD BE TOXIC
AND THEN TRACEABLE.

1077
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:22,822
HOW DID YOU
FIGURE THIS OUT?

1078
01:15:29,089 --> 01:15:31,352
TAKE THAT
TO THE PRESS.

1079
01:15:31,396 --> 01:15:33,398
I MIGHT HAVE SOME
TROUBLE WITH THAT.

1080
01:15:35,139 --> 01:15:39,230
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK
YOU'RE AS DANGEROUS
AS THE JOKER.

1081
01:15:39,273 --> 01:15:40,971
HE'S PSYCHOTIC.

1082
01:15:42,363 --> 01:15:46,063
SOME PEOPLE SAY
THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU.

1083
01:15:46,106 --> 01:15:48,326
WHAT PEOPLE?

1084
01:15:48,369 --> 01:15:51,590
WELL, I MEAN,
LET'S FACE IT.

1085
01:15:51,634 --> 01:15:55,333
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY

ALFRED, DID YOU
GET THE FILE
ON MY PARENTS?

1263
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:53,251
IT'S ON YOUR TABLE,
SIR.

1264
01:26:53,295 --> 01:26:54,296
THANK YOU.

1265
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,913
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND,
ALFRED?

1266
01:27:04,828 --> 01:27:06,351
I HAVE NO WISH

1267
01:27:06,395 --> 01:27:09,049
TO FILL MY FEW
REMAINING YEARS

1268
01:27:09,093 --> 01:27:11,269
GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS
OF OLD FRIENDS...

1269
01:27:15,447 --> 01:27:16,535
OR THEIR SONS.

1270
01:27:35,772 --> 01:27:38,340
 THE 200th ANNIVERSARY 
BIRTHDAY GALA

1271
01:27:38,383 --> 01:27:41,212
 HAS BEEN INDEFINITELY 
POSTPONED.

1272
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,562
 WE SIMPLY CANNOT 
GUARANTEE PUBLIC SAFETY--

1273
01:27:43,606 --> 01:27:45,303
 JOKER HERE.

1274
01:27:45,347 --> 01:27:47,218
WE'VE GOT INTERFERENCE.
CALL THE OB UNIT.

1275
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:50,482
 NOW, YOU FELLAS 
HAVE SAID SOME 
PRETTY MEAN THINGS,

1276
01:27:50,526 --> 01:27:53,050
 SOME OF WHICH 
WERE TRUE

1277
01:27:53,093 --> 01:27:55,705
 UNDER THAT FIEND 
BOSS GRISSOM.

1278
01:27:55,748 --> 01:27:58,925
 HE WAS A THIEF 
AND A TERRORIST.

1279
01:27:58,969 --> 01:28:00,231
 ON THE OTHER HAND,

1280
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:02,233
 HE HAD A TREMENDOUS 
SINGING VOICE.

1281
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,938
 NOW...I CAN 
BE THEATRICAL

1282
01:28:11,982 --> 01:28:15,159
 AND MAYBE EVEN 
A LITTLE ROUGH.

1283
01:28:15,202 --> 01:28:17,770
 BUT ONE THING 
I AM NOT

1284
01:28:17,814 --> 01:28:21,121
 IS A KILLER.

1285
01:28:21,165 --> 01:28:23,994
 I AM AN ARTIST.

1286
01:28:24,037 --> 01:28:27,084
 I LOVE 
A GOOD PARTY.

1287
01:28:27,127 --> 01:28:28,564
 SO...TRUCE.

1288
01:28:28,607 --> 01:28:33,090
COMMENCE
AU FESTIVAL.

1289
01:28:33,133 --> 01:28:36,833
 AND I'VE GOT A SURPRISE 
FOR GOTHAM CITY.

1290
01:28:36,876 --> 01:28:38,487
 AT MIDNIGHT,

1291
01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:41,490
 I WILL DUMP 
20 MILLION IN CASH

1292
01:28:41,533 --> 01:28:43,100
 ON THE CROWD.

1293
01:28:46,103 --> 01:28:49,062
 DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. 
I'VE GOT ENOUGH.

1294
01:28:49,106 --> 01:28:53,806
 WE ARE NOT PREPARED 
TO DISCUSS ANY DEALS.

1295
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:56,548
 YOU HEARD IT, FOLKS. 
20 MILLION.

1296
01:28:56,592 --> 01:28:59,986
 AND THERE WILL BE 
ENTERTAINMENT.

1297
01:29:00,030 --> 01:29:02,032
 THE BIG DUKEROO.

1298
01:29:02,075 --> 01:29:03,250
 WITH ME IN ONE CORNER,

1299
01:29:03,294 --> 01:29:05,427
 AND IN THE OTHER CORNER,

1300
01:29:05,470 --> 01:29:08,255
 THE MAN WHO HAS 
BROUGHT REAL TERROR

1301
01:29:08,299 --> 01:29:09,909
 TO GOTHAM CITY--

1302
01:29:09,953 --> 01:29:12,042
 BATMAN.

1303
01:29:12,085 --> 01:29:13,783
 CAN YOU HEAR ME?

1304
01:29:13,826 --> 01:29:15,741
 JUST THE TWO OF US.

1305
01:29:15,785 --> 01:29:18,831
MANO Y MANO.

1306
01:29:18,875 --> 01:29:21,268
 I HAVE TAKEN OFF 
MY MAKE-UP.

1307
01:29:22,661 --> 01:29:26,056
 LET'S SEE IF YOU 
CAN TAKE OFF YOURS.

1308
01:31:28,091 --> 01:31:29,614
 AAH!

1309
01:31:39,189 --> 01:31:41,887
 TELL ME, KID...

1310
01:31:41,931 --> 01:31:44,107
 YOU EVER DANCED 
WITH THE DEVIL

1311
01:31:44,150 --> 01:31:47,023
 BY THE PALE 
MOONLIGHT?

1312
01:31:54,073 --> 01:31:55,597
 MAN, LET'S GO!

1313
01:31:58,469 --> 01:32:00,689
 LET'S GO, JACK!

1314
01:32:03,996 --> 01:32:05,781
 SEE YOU AROUND, KID.

1315
01:32:25,061 --> 01:32:26,323
THANKS.

1316
01:32:32,198 --> 01:32:33,678
HI.

1317
01:32:35,419 --> 01:32:38,335
TELL ME
IF I'M CRAZY...

1318
01:32:38,378 --> 01:32:41,120
BUT THAT WASN'T
JUST ANOTHER NIGHT

1319
01:32:41,164 --> 01:32:43,340
FOR EITHER OF US,
WAS IT?

1320
01:32:44,907 --> 01:32:49,738
I MEAN, WE--WE BOTH
GOT TO EACH OTHER,
DIDN'T WE?

1321
01:32:52,088 --> 01:32:54,917
WHY WON'T YOU
LET ME IN?

1322
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,005
WHY?

1323
01:32:59,399 --> 01:33:00,836
YOU GOT IN.

1324
01:33:05,928 --> 01:33:09,322
I'VE LOVED YOU
SINCE I MET YOU,

1325
01:33:09,366 --> 01:33:11,934
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK
OF ALL THIS.

1326
01:33:11,977 --> 01:33:13,239
I REALLY DON'T.

1327
01:33:13,283 --> 01:33:15,633
SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

1328
01:33:15,677 --> 01:33:17,766
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
I HAVE TO DO.

1329
01:33:17,809 --> 01:33:19,506
WHY?

1330
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:21,639
BECAUSE
NOBODY ELSE CAN.

1331
01:33:23,162 --> 01:33:24,729
LOOK...

1332
01:33:24,773 --> 01:33:28,167
I TRIED TO AVOID
ALL THIS, BUT I CAN'T.

1333
01:33:28,211 --> 01:33:30,517
THIS IS HOW IT IS.

1334
01:33:30,561 --> 01:33:32,737
IT'S NOT
A PERFECT WORLD.

1335
01:33:32,781 --> 01:33:34,826
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO
BE A PERFECT WORLD.

1336
01:33:39,483 --> 01:33:41,616
I JUST GOT TO KNOW--

1337
01:33:41,659 --> 01:33:43,879
ARE WE GOING TO TRY
TO LOVE EACH OTHER?

1338
01:33:47,317 --> 01:33:49,798
I'D LIKE TO...

1339
01:33:49,841 --> 01:33:52,191
BUT HE'S OUT THERE
RIGHT NOW,

1340
01:33:52,235 --> 01:33:54,890
AND I'VE GOT
TO GO TO WORK.

1341
01:35:36,992 --> 01:35:39,385

1415
01:39:25,437 --> 01:39:28,527
OF YOUR FAILED
AND USELESS LIVES.

1416
01:39:28,571 --> 01:39:31,095
BUT, AS MY PLASTIC SURGEON
ALWAYS SAID,

1417
01:39:31,139 --> 01:39:34,969
"IF YOU GOT TO GO,
GO WITH A SMILE."

1418
01:40:06,826 --> 01:40:08,176
OH, MY GOD.

1419
01:40:08,219 --> 01:40:10,265
SMYLEX GAS.

1420
01:40:10,308 --> 01:40:11,657
HE'S GOING

1421
01:40:11,701 --> 01:40:13,268
GET IN THE CAR.

1422
01:40:13,311 --> 01:40:15,313
