1
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:36,821
Long before the birth of light,
there was darkness.

2
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:41,034
And from that darkness
came the Dark Elves.

3
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:46,623
Millennia ago,
the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith

4
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:51,628
sought to transform our universe
back into one of eternal night.

5
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:58,801
Such evil was possible
through the power of the Aether,

6
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,680
an ancient force of infinite destruction.

7
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,976
Malekith.

8
00:01:07,143 --> 00:01:08,853
Asgard's forces are upon us.

9
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:21,574
The noble armies of Asgard,
led by my father, King Bor,

10
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:24,619
waged a mighty war
against these creatures.

11
00:01:35,588 --> 00:01:37,882
Send in the Kursed!

12
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:57,485
As the Nine Worlds
converged above him,

13
00:01:57,568 --> 00:02:02,031
Malekith could at last
unleash the Aether.

14
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:23,428
But Asgard ripped
the weapon from his grasp.

15
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,639
Without it, the Dark Elves fell.

16
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,114
With the battle all but lost,

17
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:45,783
Malekith sacrificed his own people

18
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:50,663
in a desperate attempt
to lay waste to Asgard's army.

19
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:55,835
Their deaths will mean our survival.

20
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:59,297
This war is far from over.

21
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:12,518
Malekith was vanquished,
and the Aether was no more.

22
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,438
Or so we were led to believe.

23
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:20,234
Sire, the Aether. Shall we destroy it?

24
00:03:20,902 --> 00:03:23,279
If only we could.

25
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:25,281
But its power is too great.

26
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,367
Bury it deep.

27
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:30,912
Somewhere no one will ever find it.

28
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:13,746
Loki.

29
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:15,456
Hello, Mother.

30
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,834
Have I made you proud?

31
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,378
Please, don't make this worse.

32
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:22,296
Define "worse."

33
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,048
Enough!

34
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:26,509
I will speak to the prisoner alone.

35
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:42,900
I really don't see
what all the fuss is about.

36
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:46,445
Do you not truly feel
the gravity of your crimes?

37
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:49,407
Wherever you go, there is war, ruin,

38
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:51,576
and death.

39
00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:55,955
I went down to Midgard to rule the
people of Earth as a benevolent god.

40
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:58,291
Just like you.

41
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:02,253
We are not gods.
We are born, we live, we die.

42
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:04,797
Just as humans do.

43
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:08,134
Give or take 5,000 years.

44
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:12,054
All this because Loki desires a throne.

45
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:13,556
It is my birthright.

46
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:17,059
Your birthright was to die

47
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,103
as a child.

48
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:22,690
Cast out onto a frozen rock.

49
00:05:24,609 --> 00:05:26,819
If I had not taken you in,

50
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:29,614
you would not be here now to hate me.

51
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:31,908
If I am for the axe,
then for mercy's sake,

52
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:34,493
just swing it.

53
00:05:35,036 --> 00:05:36,796
It's not that I don't
love our little talks,

54
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:38,789
it's just...

55
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:41,542
I don't love them.

56
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,878
Frigga is the only reason
you're still alive,

57
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:45,379
and you will never see her again.

58
00:05:46,297 --> 00:05:50,593
You will spend the rest of your days
in the dungeons.

59
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:55,848
And what of Thor?

60
00:05:56,474 --> 00:06:00,061
You'll make that witless oaf king
while I rot in chains.

61
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:03,731
Thor must strive to undo
the damage you have done.

62
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:05,418
He will bring order to the Nine Realms

63
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,526
and then, yes...

64
00:06:08,444 --> 00:06:10,363
He will be king.

65
00:06:57,743 --> 00:06:59,453
I've got this completely under control!

66
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,664
Is that why everything is on fire?

67
00:07:25,688 --> 00:07:27,231
You're welcome.

68
00:07:48,878 --> 00:07:49,920
All yours.

69
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:13,569
Hello.

70
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:18,491
I accept your surrender.

71
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,713
Anyone else?

72
00:08:40,596 --> 00:08:44,141
Perhaps next time
we should start with the big one.

73
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:47,353
Keep moving. Come on!

74
00:08:58,823 --> 00:09:01,283
Keep moving. Go ahead of me.
Don't you turn around!

75
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:04,078
Where do we go next?

76
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:08,207
Hogun, the peace
is nearly won across the Nine Realms.

77
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,877
You should stay here. Be with
your people, where your heart is.

78
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:13,629
Asgard can wait.

79
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:17,007
You have my thanks.

80
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,844
As you have mine.

81
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:25,641
Heimdall, when you're ready.

82
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,563
Is Vanaheim secure?

83
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,190
As are Nornheim and Ria.

84
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,040
Though our work would have gone
more quickly with you at the fore.

85
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:22,072
You must think I'm a piece of bread
that needs to be buttered so heavily.

86
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:24,325
That was not my intent.

87
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:26,827
For the first time
since Bifrost was destroyed,

88
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:28,704
the Nine Realms are at peace.

89
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:31,290
They're well reminded of our strength

90
00:10:31,457 --> 00:10:36,086
and you have earned their respect
and my gratitude.

91
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,296
Thank you.

92
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:39,924
Nothing out of order

93
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:43,219
except your confused
and distracted heart.

94
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:45,638
This isn't about Jane Foster, Father.

95
00:10:46,055 --> 00:10:47,695
Human lives are fleeting,
they're nothing.

96
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,888
You'd be better served
by what lies in front of you.

97
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:54,289
I'm telling you this, not as the Allfather,

98
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:55,356
but as your father.

99
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:56,440
You are ready.

100
00:10:56,774 --> 00:10:58,567
The time has come
for you to take the throne.

101
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,444
Embrace and celebrate
what you've won.

102
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,571
Join your warriors.

103
00:11:02,655 --> 00:11:05,115
Eat and drink, revel in their celebration.

104
00:11:06,242 --> 00:11:08,577
At least pretend to enjoy yourself.

105
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:54,832
Another!

106
00:12:11,056 --> 00:12:14,059
There was a time
when you would celebrate for weeks.

107
00:12:15,394 --> 00:12:18,480
I remember you celebrated
the Battle of Harokin

108
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:20,858
so much that you nearly
started the second.

109
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:23,527
Well, the first was so much fun.

110
00:12:29,992 --> 00:12:32,036
Take a drink with me.

111
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:35,205
Surely, the Allfather could have
no further task for you tonight.

112
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:37,207
No, this is one I set myself.

113
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,254
It does not go unnoticed
that you disappear each night.

114
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,632
There are nine realms.

115
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,760
The future king of Asgard
must focus on more than one.

116
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:54,600
I thank you for your sword

117
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:57,811
and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.

118
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,291
Hi.

119
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,627
Hi.

120
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,119
So, what's the story with you?

121
00:13:23,796 --> 00:13:25,836
Why does there have to be a story?
There's no story.

122
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:28,175
You spent the first
ten minutes of our date

123
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:30,219
hiding behind a menu
that has three choices on it.

124
00:13:30,803 --> 00:13:32,721
It's either chicken,
vegetarian, or fish, Jane.

125
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:34,932
I think there's a story

126
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:38,268
and I'm thinking
the story involves a guy.

127
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:40,270
It's complicated.

128
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:41,605
Is he still around?

129
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:43,732
No, he...

130
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:45,401
Went away.

131
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:46,944
I've been there.

132
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:49,154
The going away. It's hard, isn't it?

133
00:13:49,446 --> 00:13:50,656
I was seeing a woman

134
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:52,616
and she took a job in New York.

135
00:13:53,283 --> 00:13:55,077
Eventually, the distance killed it.

136
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:58,622
And the fact
that she kept sleeping with other dudes.

137
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:00,374
- No!
- So many.

138
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:04,545
Hi. Could we get some wine, please?

139
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:05,754
Sure, I'd love some.

140
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,464
Richard, this is Darcy.

141
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:09,967
What are you doing here?

142
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:13,178
Hello.

143
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:17,015
So, I show up to work
at the lab/your mom's house,

144
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:20,853
fully expecting you
to be moping around in your pajamas,

145
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:22,688
eating ice cream and obsessing about...

146
00:14:22,855 --> 00:14:23,856
You know who.

147
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,609
But you're not.
You're wearing lady clothes.

148
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:29,421
You even showered, didn't you?
You smell good.

149
00:14:29,445 --> 00:14:30,505
Is there a point to all this?

150
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:32,609
Because there really needs
to be a point to all this.

151
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:33,866
Right.

152
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,968
You know all that scientific equipment
you don't look at anymore?

153
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:39,455
You might want
to start looking at it again.

154
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,623
This is the reason
we came all the way out here.

155
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:42,750
It's malfunctioning.

156
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:43,834
That's what I said.

157
00:14:45,377 --> 00:14:46,795
That's what I did.

158
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:48,982
I thought you would do something
a little more scientific.

159
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:50,566
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Yeah, it's...

160
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:51,800
It doesn't look like nothing.

161
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:54,445
It kind of looks like the readings
that Erik was rambling about.

162
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,554
Our friend Erik

163
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,681
kind of went banana balls.

164
00:14:57,806 --> 00:14:58,806
He's not interested.

165
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:00,076
- I'm not interested.
- I'm interested.

166
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,518
It's time for you to go now.

167
00:15:02,895 --> 00:15:03,979
Okay.

168
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:08,358
Short but sweet.

169
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:10,152
She needs help.

170
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,365
I think I'm going to have the sea bass.

171
00:15:15,532 --> 00:15:17,409
Sea bass, yeah. Sea bass is good.

172
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:22,873
Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass,
sea bass, sea bass, sea bass.

173
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,501
Sea bass...

174
00:15:26,794 --> 00:15:27,795
Sea bass.

175
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:29,296
Jane?

176
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:30,964
Maybe you should stop
saying "sea bass"

177
00:15:31,048 --> 00:15:32,090
and go after your friend.

178
00:15:33,091 --> 00:15:34,218
This was so fun.

179
00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:37,137
I'll just stay here
and say "sea bass" alone.

180
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,021
And I hate you.

181
00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:48,774
What? I said he was cute.

182
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:50,943
Just shut up and drive.

183
00:16:00,035 --> 00:16:01,275
You need to take the next left.

184
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:04,248
- Who's he?
- He's my intern.

185
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,583
- You have an intern?
- Yeah.

186
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:08,710
Hello, Dr. Foster.

187
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:10,676
It's such a great honor
to be working with you.

188
00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:13,048
Right. I have to call Erik.

189
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,508
Take a right.

190
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,845
And a left.

191
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,891
I have totally mastered
driving in London.

192
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:26,520
Hi, Erik. It's me again. Where are you?

193
00:16:26,645 --> 00:16:29,565
I came here because you said you were
onto something, and then you vanish.

194
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,108
I'm here at Stonehenge

195
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:34,444
for what has been an
interesting unfolding of events today.

196
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:36,280
The police were called to the scene

197
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:37,865
shortly after 11 A.M. this morning

198
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:41,368
after a seemingly harmless rambler
approached the area

199
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:44,246
then, decided to strip naked
and effectively

200
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:46,498
terrorize tourists there
with scientific equipment

201
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,501
whilst shouting
that he was trying to save them.

202
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:53,881
The man, later identified
as noted astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig

203
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:56,592
has been called in
for questioning by police.

204
00:16:58,844 --> 00:17:00,637
Come on, this is exciting.

205
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:02,931
Look! The intern is excited.

206
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,266
"Ian."

207
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,851
Do you want the phase meter?

208
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:07,394
- No.
- Bring the phase meter.

209
00:17:08,312 --> 00:17:09,354
The toaster-looking thing.

210
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:12,065
Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.

211
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,117
How do I change the ringtone
on this thing?

212
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,161
An astrophysicist with three degrees

213
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,996
should be able
to change her own ringtone.

214
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:27,581
Why are you calling me?

215
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:29,917
I didn't want to shout.
Intern says it's this way.

216
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,501
"Ian." My name is Ian.

217
00:17:45,557 --> 00:17:49,227
I am not getting stabbed
in the name of science.

218
00:17:49,353 --> 00:17:50,854
It's okay, we're Americans.

219
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:52,898
Is that supposed to make them like us?

220
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:54,733
They'll make it go away.

221
00:17:57,069 --> 00:17:58,654
They're kids.

222
00:17:58,987 --> 00:18:00,113
Are you the police?

223
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:03,450
No, we're scientists. Well, I am.

224
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:04,826
Thanks.

225
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:06,620
We just found it.

226
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,040
Can you show us?

227
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:39,027
That doesn't seem right.

228
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,087
Where'd it go?

229
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:11,643
That's...

230
00:19:12,227 --> 00:19:13,311
That's incredible!

231
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:28,452
What happened?

232
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:29,995
Sometimes they come back.

233
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:31,705
Sometimes they don't.

234
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,876
I want to throw something!

235
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:37,127
Jane, give me your shoe.

236
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:41,923
I haven't seen readings like this since...

237
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:43,550
Since...

238
00:19:43,675 --> 00:19:44,676
New Mexico?

239
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,141
Don't touch anything!

240
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:55,479
Give me your shoe.

241
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,002
Were those the car keys?

242
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:57,707
Darcy!

243
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:00,997
The Aether awakens us.

244
00:23:01,164 --> 00:23:04,626
The Convergence returns.

245
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:21,017
You're late.

246
00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:25,355
Merriment can sometimes
be a heavier burden than battle.

247
00:23:25,522 --> 00:23:27,162
Then you're doing
one of them incorrectly.

248
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:29,859
Perhaps.

249
00:23:30,026 --> 00:23:31,861
How fare the stars?

250
00:23:32,028 --> 00:23:33,697
Still shining.

251
00:23:33,863 --> 00:23:36,658
From here, I can see
nine realms and ten trillion souls.

252
00:23:41,538 --> 00:23:44,291
Do you recall
what I taught you of the Convergence?

253
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:45,542
Yes.

254
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:48,044
The alignment of the worlds.

255
00:23:48,211 --> 00:23:49,921
It approaches, doesn't it?

256
00:23:50,171 --> 00:23:54,050
The universe hasn't seen this marvel
since before my watch began.

257
00:23:55,093 --> 00:23:58,305
Few can sense it. Even fewer can see it.

258
00:23:59,723 --> 00:24:02,267
But while its effects can be dangerous,

259
00:24:03,101 --> 00:24:05,937
it is truly beautiful.

260
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,690
I see nothing.

261
00:24:08,773 --> 00:24:12,402
Or, perhaps,
that is not the beauty you seek.

262
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:19,576
How is she?

263
00:24:19,743 --> 00:24:21,661
She's quite clever, your mortal.

264
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:23,038
She doesn't know it yet,

265
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:25,623
but she studies
the Convergence as well.

266
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,000
Even...

267
00:24:28,752 --> 00:24:30,170
What?

268
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:34,424
I can't see her.

269
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:16,424
Jane!

270
00:25:17,008 --> 00:25:18,301
Where the hell were you?

271
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:20,053
Tell me you didn't call the police.

272
00:25:20,136 --> 00:25:21,262
What was I supposed to do?

273
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:23,181
- Not call the police.
- I was freaking out.

274
00:25:23,264 --> 00:25:24,533
You call the cops, they call the Feds.

275
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:26,660
Next thing you know,
we have S.H.I.E.L.D. crawling all over.

276
00:25:26,684 --> 00:25:28,144
- "Area 51-ing" the place.
- Jane.

277
00:25:28,228 --> 00:25:30,313
We had a stable gravitation anomaly.

278
00:25:30,397 --> 00:25:31,689
We had unimpeded access.

279
00:25:32,023 --> 00:25:34,317
Our only competition was ten years old!

280
00:25:34,484 --> 00:25:36,027
Jane! You were gone for five hours.

281
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:37,862
What?

282
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:46,329
That's weird.

283
00:26:07,892 --> 00:26:09,310
Typical.

284
00:26:10,061 --> 00:26:11,104
Jane.

285
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:16,526
Sorry. I just needed
to make sure you were real.

286
00:26:16,693 --> 00:26:18,194
It's been a very strange day.

287
00:26:18,361 --> 00:26:19,863
I am. Jane, what...

288
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,322
Where were you?

289
00:26:21,531 --> 00:26:22,532
Where were you?

290
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,784
Heimdall cannot see you.

291
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:26,703
I was right here where you left me.

292
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:29,038
I was waiting, and then I was crying

293
00:26:29,164 --> 00:26:30,707
and then I went out looking for you.

294
00:26:30,874 --> 00:26:32,417
You said you were coming back.

295
00:26:32,584 --> 00:26:34,919
I know. I know,
but the Bifrost was destroyed.

296
00:26:35,086 --> 00:26:36,629
The Nine Realms erupted into chaos.

297
00:26:36,754 --> 00:26:38,923
Wars were raging,
marauders were pillaging.

298
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:41,092
I had to put an end to the slaughter.

299
00:26:42,677 --> 00:26:46,431
As excuses go, it's not terrible.

300
00:26:46,514 --> 00:26:49,350
But I saw you on TV.
You were in New York!

301
00:26:50,268 --> 00:26:52,979
Jane, I fought to protect you
from the dangers of my world

302
00:26:53,062 --> 00:26:54,856
but I was wrong.

303
00:26:55,023 --> 00:26:56,900
I was a fool.

304
00:26:57,775 --> 00:27:01,237
But I believe
that fate brought us together.

305
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:06,367
Jane, I don't know where you were,
or what happened, but I do know this...

306
00:27:07,202 --> 00:27:08,203
What?

307
00:27:09,454 --> 00:27:10,497
I know...

308
00:27:11,706 --> 00:27:12,832
You do?

309
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:15,418
Do what?

310
00:27:16,044 --> 00:27:17,170
What?

311
00:27:17,754 --> 00:27:18,755
Hey!

312
00:27:20,507 --> 00:27:21,966
Is this you?

313
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:28,146
We're kind of
in the middle of something here.

314
00:27:28,181 --> 00:27:30,850
I'm pretty sure we are getting arrested.

315
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,101
Hold that thought.

316
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,106
Look at you,
still all muscly and everything.

317
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,858
How's space?

318
00:27:38,942 --> 00:27:41,069
Space is fine.

319
00:27:41,194 --> 00:27:42,445
Excuse me.

320
00:27:42,612 --> 00:27:43,732
- Are you Jane Foster?
- Yes.

321
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,781
Do you know this man?

322
00:27:46,324 --> 00:27:47,450
He's my intern.

323
00:27:48,618 --> 00:27:49,786
My intern's intern.

324
00:27:49,911 --> 00:27:51,972
This is private property
and you're trespassing, the lot of you.

325
00:27:51,996 --> 00:27:53,289
You'll have to come with me.

326
00:27:59,087 --> 00:28:00,088
Jane.

327
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,840
- Jane.
- Thor?

328
00:28:03,174 --> 00:28:04,175
Are you all right?

329
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:05,552
What just happened?

330
00:28:06,135 --> 00:28:08,638
Place your hands on your heads.
Step back.

331
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:09,764
This woman is unwell.

332
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:10,848
She's dangerous.

333
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:13,184
So am I.

334
00:28:14,185 --> 00:28:16,312
Requesting armed response officers
to scene.

335
00:28:16,688 --> 00:28:18,314
- Hold on to me.
- What are you doing?

336
00:28:26,656 --> 00:28:28,700
Holy shit.

337
00:28:56,185 --> 00:28:58,229
We have to do that again.

338
00:28:58,688 --> 00:28:59,689
Hi.

339
00:29:02,525 --> 00:29:04,694
Welcome to Asgard.

340
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:28,718
Look upon my legacy, Algrim.

341
00:29:30,553 --> 00:29:32,930
I can barely remember a time
before the light.

342
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:36,851
Our survival will be your legacy.

343
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:42,482
The Asgardians will suffer
as we have suffered.

344
00:29:42,565 --> 00:29:43,816
I will reclaim the Aether.

345
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,151
I will restore our world.

346
00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:47,945
And I will put an end
to this poisoned universe.

347
00:29:56,245 --> 00:29:57,246
What's that?

348
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,373
Be still.

349
00:30:05,922 --> 00:30:08,299
This is not of Earth. What is it?

350
00:30:09,092 --> 00:30:10,760
We do not know.

351
00:30:11,469 --> 00:30:15,431
But she will not survive the
amount of energy surging within her.

352
00:30:20,978 --> 00:30:22,658
That's a quantum field generator,
isn't it?

353
00:30:23,272 --> 00:30:25,108
It's a soul forge.

354
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:28,444
Does a soul forge transfer molecular
energy from one place to another?

355
00:30:31,322 --> 00:30:32,365
Yes.

356
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,242
Quantum field generator.

357
00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:38,287
My words are mere noises to you
that you ignore them completely?

358
00:30:38,454 --> 00:30:39,580
She is ill.

359
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:41,958
She is mortal.

360
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:43,668
Illness is their defining trait.

361
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:45,473
I brought her here
because we can help her.

362
00:30:45,503 --> 00:30:47,422
She does not belong here in Asgard

363
00:30:47,588 --> 00:30:50,967
any more than a goat
belongs at a banquet table.

364
00:30:51,134 --> 00:30:52,719
Did he just...

365
00:30:52,802 --> 00:30:54,387
Who do you think you are?

366
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,014
I am Odin, King of Asgard.

367
00:30:57,181 --> 00:30:58,725
Protector of the Nine Realms.

368
00:31:00,476 --> 00:31:01,519
Well, I'm...

369
00:31:01,644 --> 00:31:04,480
I know very well who you are,
Jane Foster.

370
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,816
You told your dad about me?

371
00:31:07,692 --> 00:31:09,152
Something is within her, Father.

372
00:31:09,277 --> 00:31:10,587
Something I have not seen before.

373
00:31:10,611 --> 00:31:11,821
Her world has its healers.

374
00:31:11,946 --> 00:31:13,866
They are called "doctors."
Let them deal with it.

375
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,783
Guards, take her back to Midgard.

376
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,661
No, I would not...

377
00:31:20,496 --> 00:31:21,581
...touch her.

378
00:31:21,706 --> 00:31:22,999
Jane, are you all right?

379
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:24,667
Yeah.

380
00:31:28,379 --> 00:31:29,630
It's impossible.

381
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,593
The infection... It's defending her.

382
00:31:34,218 --> 00:31:35,511
No.

383
00:31:36,012 --> 00:31:37,680
It's defending itself.

384
00:31:38,723 --> 00:31:40,725
Come with me.

385
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:44,645
There are relics
that pre-date the universe itself.

386
00:31:44,812 --> 00:31:48,691
What lies within her
appears to be one of them.

387
00:31:49,692 --> 00:31:52,195
The Nine Realms are not eternal.

388
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:53,529
They had a dawn

389
00:31:53,696 --> 00:31:54,864
as they will have a dusk.

390
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:57,200
But before that dawn

391
00:31:57,366 --> 00:32:03,706
the dark forces, the Dark Elves,
reigned absolute and unchallenged.

392
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:06,959
"Born of eternal night

393
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:09,921
"the Dark Elves come
to steal away the light."

394
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:13,800
I know these stories.
Mother told them to us as children.

395
00:32:13,883 --> 00:32:17,136
Their leader Malekith made a weapon
out of that darkness

396
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,805
and it was called the Aether.

397
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:21,933
While the other relics
often appear as stones

398
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,685
the Aether is fluid and everchanging.

399
00:32:24,852 --> 00:32:27,438
It changes matter into dark matter.

400
00:32:27,563 --> 00:32:31,150
It seeks out host bodies,
drawing strength from their life-force.

401
00:32:32,401 --> 00:32:35,363
Malekith sought to use
the Aether's power

402
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:39,283
to return the universe
to one of darkness.

403
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:42,578
But, after eternities of bloodshed

404
00:32:42,662 --> 00:32:45,248
my father Bor finally triumphed

405
00:32:45,414 --> 00:32:49,919
ushering in a peace
that lasted thousands of years.

406
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,088
What happened?

407
00:32:53,381 --> 00:32:55,299
He killed them all.

408
00:32:55,424 --> 00:32:57,593
Are you certain?

409
00:32:57,677 --> 00:32:59,738
The Aether was said to have
been destroyed with them,

410
00:32:59,762 --> 00:33:01,013
and yet here it is.

411
00:33:02,431 --> 00:33:04,600
The Dark Elves are dead.

412
00:33:05,268 --> 00:33:08,729
Does your book happen to mention
how to get it out of me?

413
00:33:08,813 --> 00:33:09,814
No.

414
00:33:10,815 --> 00:33:12,441
It does not.

415
00:33:22,285 --> 00:33:25,162
The worlds are nearly aligned.

416
00:33:30,585 --> 00:33:32,336
You will be the last of the Kursed.

417
00:33:33,504 --> 00:33:35,131
Let my life be sacrificed.

418
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,801
It is no less than our people did,

419
00:33:39,468 --> 00:33:40,636
or you have done.

420
00:33:48,436 --> 00:33:50,396
You will become darkness,

421
00:33:51,606 --> 00:33:55,318
cursed to this existence
until it consumes you.

422
00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:04,452
Until then, no power our enemies
possess can stop you.

423
00:34:07,538 --> 00:34:14,337
I will tear down their defenses and
ensure your return to a universe reborn.

424
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:39,570
Acting as caretakers to these
scoundrels is beneath us.

425
00:34:39,737 --> 00:34:44,033
Please! If they were beneath you,
my rotund friend, they'd all be dead.

426
00:34:58,714 --> 00:35:00,716
- Keep in line!
- Move it!

427
00:35:02,218 --> 00:35:05,888
Odin continues to bring me new friends.

428
00:35:06,263 --> 00:35:08,015
How thoughtful.

429
00:35:08,265 --> 00:35:11,727
The books I sent,
do they not interest you?

430
00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:15,523
Is that how I am to while away eternity?
Reading?

431
00:35:15,606 --> 00:35:18,734
I've done everything in my power
to make you comfortable, Loki.

432
00:35:18,818 --> 00:35:19,860
Have you?

433
00:35:20,903 --> 00:35:22,738
Does Odin share your concern?

434
00:35:24,198 --> 00:35:25,741
Does Thor?

435
00:35:25,908 --> 00:35:29,537
It must be so inconvenient,
them asking after me day and night.

436
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,748
You know full well it was your actions
that brought you here.

437
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,625
My actions?

438
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:38,045
I was merely giving truth to the lie
that I had been fed my entire life...

439
00:35:38,129 --> 00:35:39,797
That I was born to be a king.

440
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,841
A king?

441
00:35:41,924 --> 00:35:43,926
A true king admits his faults.

442
00:35:44,051 --> 00:35:45,491
What of the lives you took on Earth?

443
00:35:45,636 --> 00:35:47,221
A mere handful
compared to the number

444
00:35:47,304 --> 00:35:49,098
that Odin has taken himself.

445
00:35:49,265 --> 00:35:51,934
- Your father...
- He's not my father!

446
00:35:54,812 --> 00:35:57,023
Then am I not your mother?

447
00:36:02,236 --> 00:36:04,196
You're not.

448
00:36:07,992 --> 00:36:12,955
You're always so perceptive
about everyone but yourself.

449
00:36:28,137 --> 00:36:31,307
When you came for me,
you knew I was in trouble.

450
00:36:31,432 --> 00:36:32,683
Heimdall had lost sight of you.

451
00:36:32,808 --> 00:36:34,477
You were no longer on Earth.

452
00:36:34,643 --> 00:36:35,936
How is that possible?

453
00:36:36,145 --> 00:36:38,105
I believe you were and you weren't.

454
00:36:38,189 --> 00:36:41,067
The Nine Realms
travel within Yggdrasil

455
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:44,612
orbiting Midgard much the way
your planets orbit the sun.

456
00:36:44,779 --> 00:36:48,908
And every 5,000 years,
the worlds align perfectly

457
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:51,202
and we call this the Convergence.

458
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:56,999
During this time, the borders
between worlds become blurred.

459
00:36:57,666 --> 00:37:00,461
It's possible
you found one of these points.

460
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:04,715
We are lucky that it remained open.

461
00:37:04,882 --> 00:37:09,136
Once the worlds pass out of alignment

462
00:37:10,554 --> 00:37:12,598
then the connection is lost.

463
00:37:25,361 --> 00:37:27,738
I like the way you explain things.

464
00:37:30,032 --> 00:37:31,408
What's going to happen to me?

465
00:37:31,575 --> 00:37:33,160
I'll find a way to save you, Jane.

466
00:37:33,327 --> 00:37:36,497
- Your father said there was...
- My father doesn't know everything.

467
00:37:36,705 --> 00:37:38,374
Don't let him hear you say that.

468
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,043
Jane Foster...

469
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:42,461
Please meet Frigga,

470
00:37:42,545 --> 00:37:44,463
Queen of Asgard, and my mother.

471
00:37:47,216 --> 00:37:48,676
Hi.

472
00:38:37,808 --> 00:38:39,226
Move!

473
00:39:25,814 --> 00:39:27,066
To the dungeons!

474
00:39:27,441 --> 00:39:28,442
Come on!

475
00:39:52,258 --> 00:39:54,677
You might want to take
the stairs to the left.

476
00:40:05,729 --> 00:40:07,064
The prisons.

477
00:40:07,231 --> 00:40:09,024
- Loki...
- Go.

478
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:11,026
I will look after her.

479
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:24,054
It's as if they resent being imprisoned!

480
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:30,129
There's no pleasing some creatures.

481
00:40:38,887 --> 00:40:41,047
Return to your cells,
no further harm will come to you.

482
00:40:41,223 --> 00:40:42,391
You have my word.

483
00:40:44,226 --> 00:40:46,562
Very well, you do not have my word.

484
00:40:56,447 --> 00:40:58,449
Send a squadron to the weapons vault.

485
00:40:58,574 --> 00:41:01,118
Defend it at all costs.
Secure the dungeon.

486
00:41:01,285 --> 00:41:02,870
- Odin.
- Frigga.

487
00:41:03,746 --> 00:41:04,747
Go!

488
00:41:05,539 --> 00:41:06,790
It's a skirmish.

489
00:41:06,915 --> 00:41:08,083
Nothing to fear.

490
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:09,668
You've never been a very good liar.

491
00:41:10,627 --> 00:41:11,670
Take her to your chambers.

492
00:41:11,754 --> 00:41:13,630
I'll come for you when it's safe.

493
00:41:13,756 --> 00:41:15,257
You take care.

494
00:41:15,341 --> 00:41:16,461
Despite all I have survived,

495
00:41:17,259 --> 00:41:19,970
my queen still worries over me.

496
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:21,406
It's only because I worry over you

497
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,265
that you have survived.

498
00:41:25,768 --> 00:41:26,977
Listen to me now.

499
00:41:27,144 --> 00:41:30,105
I need you to do everything I ask,
no questions.

500
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,398
Yes, ma'am.

501
00:46:40,957 --> 00:46:44,086
The throne of Asgard is destroyed!
To the king!

502
00:46:59,893 --> 00:47:00,894
Frigga.

503
00:47:09,695 --> 00:47:12,114
Stand down, creature,

504
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,907
and you may still survive this.

505
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,076
I have survived worse, woman.

506
00:47:17,536 --> 00:47:18,912
Who are you?

507
00:47:19,454 --> 00:47:21,498
I am Malekith.

508
00:47:21,665 --> 00:47:24,292
And I would have what is mine.

509
00:47:54,948 --> 00:47:57,117
You have taken something, child.

510
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,202
Give it back.

511
00:48:13,592 --> 00:48:14,676
Witch!

512
00:48:18,388 --> 00:48:19,890
Where is the Aether?

513
00:48:20,015 --> 00:48:22,309
I'll never tell you.

514
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:24,519
I believe you.

515
00:48:27,022 --> 00:48:29,191
No!

516
00:51:55,939 --> 00:51:58,108
The universe rotates
on a 5,000-year cycle

517
00:51:58,984 --> 00:52:01,361
and once a cycle, all the worlds align.

518
00:52:02,028 --> 00:52:04,948
Imagine... Imagine that this is our world.

519
00:52:05,699 --> 00:52:07,742
Thank you. And this is another world.

520
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:09,869
Normally, they're separate.

521
00:52:10,036 --> 00:52:11,746
But during the Alignment,

522
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:15,375
everything is connected,
all nine realms.

523
00:52:15,542 --> 00:52:17,711
All nine realms
are passing through each other

524
00:52:17,794 --> 00:52:20,130
and gravity, light, and even matter,

525
00:52:20,422 --> 00:52:22,841
is crashing from one world to the other.

526
00:52:25,176 --> 00:52:29,097
But if this happens to us now,
the result will be cataclysmic.

527
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:33,685
My gravimetric spikes can stabilize
the focal point of the Convergence.

528
00:52:34,394 --> 00:52:36,688
This time, the Alignment

529
00:52:36,771 --> 00:52:39,774
and all the other worlds
would just pass us by.

530
00:52:39,941 --> 00:52:41,443
It's beautiful.

531
00:52:42,944 --> 00:52:45,113
It's simple. Any questions?

532
00:52:48,241 --> 00:52:49,284
Yeah.

533
00:52:49,743 --> 00:52:52,454
Can I have my shoe back?

534
00:53:00,211 --> 00:53:04,215
Heal. You will need your strength
to reclaim the Aether.

535
00:53:04,716 --> 00:53:08,303
And when you wake,
we will kill them all.

536
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,173
Jane Foster?

537
00:53:46,841 --> 00:53:49,010
You need to come with us.

538
00:53:50,261 --> 00:53:53,348
We are still unable to restore
the palace shields.

539
00:53:53,473 --> 00:53:54,891
Our artillery cannot detect them.

540
00:53:55,016 --> 00:53:56,810
Even Heimdall cannot see them.

541
00:54:00,188 --> 00:54:04,109
My king, we are all but defenseless.

542
00:54:06,694 --> 00:54:08,154
She's your prisoner now?

543
00:54:10,532 --> 00:54:11,866
Leave us.

544
00:54:20,875 --> 00:54:23,044
I do not wish to fight with you.

545
00:54:23,545 --> 00:54:25,296
Nor I with you.

546
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,215
But I intend to pursue Malekith.

547
00:54:27,382 --> 00:54:28,675
We possess the Aether.

548
00:54:29,342 --> 00:54:30,552
Malekith will come to us.

549
00:54:30,718 --> 00:54:32,720
Yes, and he will destroy us.

550
00:54:32,804 --> 00:54:34,931
You overestimate
the power of these creatures.

551
00:54:35,056 --> 00:54:37,392
No, I value our people's lives.

552
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:40,854
I'll take Jane to the Dark World,
and draw the enemy away from Asgard.

553
00:54:41,604 --> 00:54:43,815
When Malekith
pulls the Aether from Jane,

554
00:54:43,898 --> 00:54:45,900
it will be exposed and vulnerable.

555
00:54:46,067 --> 00:54:47,861
And I will destroy it and him.

556
00:54:49,904 --> 00:54:52,657
If you fail, you risk this weapon

557
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,576
falling into the hands of our enemies.

558
00:54:54,701 --> 00:54:57,078
The risk is far greater if we do nothing.

559
00:54:57,203 --> 00:54:59,164
His ship could be over our heads
right now,

560
00:54:59,372 --> 00:55:00,582
we would never even know it.

561
00:55:00,748 --> 00:55:01,916
If and when he comes

562
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,171
his men will fall
on 10,000 Asgardian blades.

563
00:55:06,254 --> 00:55:07,773
And how many of our men
shall fall on theirs?

564
00:55:07,797 --> 00:55:09,757
As many as are needed!

565
00:55:18,725 --> 00:55:20,268
We will fight!

566
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:25,315
Till the last Asgardian breath.

567
00:55:26,107 --> 00:55:29,152
Till the last drop of Asgardian blood.

568
00:55:31,279 --> 00:55:34,407
Then how are you different
from Malekith?

569
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:40,205
The difference, my son, is that I will win.

570
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:57,305
Jane isn't calling me back,
Erik isn't calling me back,

571
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:59,349
stupid S.H.I.E.L.D.
isn't calling me back.

572
00:55:59,474 --> 00:56:01,309
- What's S.H.I.E.L.D?
- It's a secret.

573
00:56:01,392 --> 00:56:03,311
Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.

574
00:56:03,436 --> 00:56:06,231
Thor came back,
he took Jane to Asgard,

575
00:56:06,481 --> 00:56:09,943
and I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do.

576
00:56:10,026 --> 00:56:11,945
Something else went missing this week

577
00:56:12,028 --> 00:56:15,156
when astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig

578
00:56:15,281 --> 00:56:18,826
notable for his involvement
in the alien invasion of New York

579
00:56:18,993 --> 00:56:20,286
streaked nude across...

580
00:56:20,453 --> 00:56:22,997
Darcy, you really need to look at this.

581
00:56:23,164 --> 00:56:24,332
Your friend, Erik...

582
00:56:24,415 --> 00:56:26,167
What was his last name again?

583
00:56:27,126 --> 00:56:30,505
And began shouting at visitors
to the historic site.

584
00:56:30,672 --> 00:56:32,715
He was later taken into police custody

585
00:56:33,341 --> 00:56:35,635
for psychiatric evaluation.

586
00:56:35,802 --> 00:56:37,845
Police are still refusing to confirm...

587
00:56:48,356 --> 00:56:50,400
You were not at Odin's war council.

588
00:56:50,525 --> 00:56:52,860
The Bifrost is closed
by your father's orders.

589
00:56:53,069 --> 00:56:54,362
No one is to come

590
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:55,738
or to go.

591
00:56:57,824 --> 00:57:00,535
We face an enemy
that is invisible even to me.

592
00:57:00,702 --> 00:57:04,414
What use is a guardian such as that?

593
00:57:05,873 --> 00:57:08,626
Malekith will return, you know this.

594
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:12,213
I need your help.

595
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:16,426
I cannot overrule my king's wishes.
Not even for you.

596
00:57:16,551 --> 00:57:18,177
I'm not asking you to.

597
00:57:18,386 --> 00:57:20,722
The realms need their Allfather strong
and unchallenged

598
00:57:20,888 --> 00:57:23,433
whether he is or not.

599
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,310
But he is blinded, Heimdall

600
00:57:25,393 --> 00:57:27,145
by hatred and by grief.

601
00:57:27,228 --> 00:57:28,896
As are we all.

602
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,189
I see clearly enough.

603
00:57:30,273 --> 00:57:31,899
The risks are too great.

604
00:57:32,191 --> 00:57:34,902
Everything we do from here on is a risk.

605
00:57:35,069 --> 00:57:36,779
There is no other way.

606
00:57:40,742 --> 00:57:42,952
What do you require of me?

607
00:57:43,077 --> 00:57:46,622
What I'm about to ask of you
is treason of the highest order.

608
00:57:46,914 --> 00:57:50,960
Success will bring us exile
and failure shall mean our death.

609
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:57,925
Malekith knew the Aether was here.
He can sense its power.

610
00:57:58,468 --> 00:58:00,636
If we do nothing,
he will come for it again

611
00:58:00,803 --> 00:58:04,932
but this time, lay waste to all of Asgard.

612
00:58:05,933 --> 00:58:07,935
We must move Jane off-world.

613
00:58:08,102 --> 00:58:09,771
The Bifrost has been shut down

614
00:58:09,896 --> 00:58:11,606
and the Tesseract
locked away in the vault.

615
00:58:11,773 --> 00:58:15,902
There are other paths off Asgard.
Ways known only to a few.

616
00:58:15,985 --> 00:58:17,904
One, actually.

617
00:58:19,989 --> 00:58:21,741
No.

618
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,374
Thor. After all this time

619
00:58:29,457 --> 00:58:32,126
and now you come to visit me.

620
00:58:33,336 --> 00:58:34,629
Why?

621
00:58:35,963 --> 00:58:39,008
Have you come to gloat? To mock?

622
00:58:39,133 --> 00:58:40,760
Loki, enough.

623
00:58:41,177 --> 00:58:43,012
No more illusions.

624
00:58:50,186 --> 00:58:52,271
Now you see me, brother.

625
00:59:00,988 --> 00:59:02,698
Did she suffer?

626
00:59:02,824 --> 00:59:05,159
I did not come here to share our grief.

627
00:59:05,284 --> 00:59:08,371
Instead I offer you the chance
of a far richer sacrament.

628
00:59:09,789 --> 00:59:10,998
Go on.

629
00:59:11,165 --> 00:59:13,835
I know you seek vengeance
as much as I do.

630
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:16,879
You help me escape Asgard
and I will grant it to you.

631
00:59:17,171 --> 00:59:18,548
Vengeance

632
00:59:18,714 --> 00:59:21,134
and afterward, this cell.

633
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:32,687
You must be truly desperate
to come to me for help.

634
00:59:34,355 --> 00:59:35,940
What makes you think
you can trust me?

635
00:59:36,023 --> 00:59:37,442
I don't.

636
00:59:39,152 --> 00:59:40,236
Mother did.

637
00:59:41,529 --> 00:59:44,031
But you should know that when
we fought each other in the past,

638
00:59:44,866 --> 00:59:46,325
I did so with a glimmer of hope

639
00:59:46,409 --> 00:59:48,286
that my brother
was still in there somewhere.

640
00:59:49,912 --> 00:59:52,373
That hope no longer exists
to protect you.

641
00:59:53,207 --> 00:59:56,586
You betray me, and I will kill you.

642
01:00:02,091 --> 01:00:03,801
When do we start?

643
01:00:03,885 --> 01:00:05,219
He will betray you.

644
01:00:05,303 --> 01:00:06,929
He will try.

645
01:00:11,517 --> 01:00:13,895
This is so unlike you, brother.

646
01:00:14,061 --> 01:00:16,063
So clandestine.

647
01:00:16,189 --> 01:00:18,429
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather just punch your way out?

648
01:00:19,192 --> 01:00:21,068
If you keep speaking, I just might.

649
01:00:21,194 --> 01:00:23,029
Fine. As you wish.

650
01:00:23,404 --> 01:00:24,572
I'm not even here.

651
01:00:25,907 --> 01:00:27,408
Is this better?

652
01:00:27,575 --> 01:00:30,077
It's better company at least.

653
01:00:30,203 --> 01:00:34,123
Still, we could be less conspicuous.

654
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:38,044
Brother, you look ravishing.

655
01:00:40,046 --> 01:00:42,590
It will hurt no less
when I kill you in this form.

656
01:00:42,757 --> 01:00:45,927
Very well. Perhaps you
prefer one of your new companions

657
01:00:46,093 --> 01:00:48,137
given that you seem
to like them so much.

658
01:00:48,721 --> 01:00:50,723
This is much better.

659
01:00:52,141 --> 01:00:54,769
The costume is a bit much. So tight.

660
01:00:54,936 --> 01:00:56,229
But the confidence...

661
01:00:56,395 --> 01:00:58,814
I can feel the righteousness surging.

662
01:00:58,981 --> 01:01:01,442
Hey, do you want to have
a rousing discussion about truth?

663
01:01:01,901 --> 01:01:03,110
Honor? Patriotism?

664
01:01:03,194 --> 01:01:04,195
God bless Amer...

665
01:01:06,906 --> 01:01:08,241
What?

666
01:01:12,745 --> 01:01:15,122
You could at least
furnish me with a weapon.

667
01:01:15,289 --> 01:01:17,166
My dagger, something.

668
01:01:22,672 --> 01:01:23,923
At last.

669
01:01:24,006 --> 01:01:25,716
A little common sense.

670
01:01:31,847 --> 01:01:34,392
And I thought you liked tricks.

671
01:01:34,475 --> 01:01:39,021
Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is
being guarded by a legion of Einherjar

672
01:01:39,188 --> 01:01:40,940
who will see you coming
from miles away.

673
01:01:41,023 --> 01:01:42,733
I won't be the one who comes for her.

674
01:01:50,533 --> 01:01:51,534
I'm not hungry.

675
01:01:52,326 --> 01:01:54,078
What the...

676
01:01:54,161 --> 01:01:56,414
Good. Let's go.

677
01:02:01,794 --> 01:02:02,837
You're...

678
01:02:03,004 --> 01:02:04,964
I'm Loki, you may have heard of me.

679
01:02:05,047 --> 01:02:07,592
That was for New York.

680
01:02:07,675 --> 01:02:09,051
I like her.

681
01:02:09,176 --> 01:02:10,845
And what of the Allfather?

682
01:02:11,512 --> 01:02:15,224
It is my sworn duty to notify him
of crimes against the throne.

683
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:18,978
You called me here on an urgent matter.

684
01:02:20,021 --> 01:02:21,022
What is it?

685
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,773
Treason, my lord.

686
01:02:22,857 --> 01:02:24,191
Whose?

687
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:25,943
Mine.

688
01:02:26,694 --> 01:02:28,195
My king!

689
01:02:28,279 --> 01:02:30,281
The mortal has been taken.

690
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,161
Stop Thor.

691
01:02:35,244 --> 01:02:37,371
By any means necessary.

692
01:02:40,082 --> 01:02:42,585
There they are! Take them.

693
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:43,710
On my command.

694
01:02:43,753 --> 01:02:45,963
I'll hold them off. Take her.

695
01:02:46,589 --> 01:02:48,007
Thank you.

696
01:02:50,718 --> 01:02:52,970
Betray him, and I'll kill you.

697
01:02:55,222 --> 01:02:57,808
It's good to see you, too, Sif.

698
01:03:03,397 --> 01:03:07,735
Assuming you can get Loki's help
and you can free this mortal

699
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,362
what good would it do?

700
01:03:09,445 --> 01:03:12,323
We'd all be dead the minute
we step one foot outside the palace.

701
01:03:12,406 --> 01:03:15,618
That, my friend,
is why we won't be leaving by foot.

702
01:03:19,747 --> 01:03:21,499
I will give you as much time as I can.

703
01:03:21,582 --> 01:03:23,417
Thank you, my friend.

704
01:03:27,588 --> 01:03:30,758
If you even think about betraying him...

705
01:03:30,883 --> 01:03:32,510
You'll kill me?

706
01:03:32,593 --> 01:03:34,595
Evidently, there will be a line.

707
01:03:49,902 --> 01:03:51,987
I thought you said
you knew how to fly this thing.

708
01:03:52,154 --> 01:03:53,948
I said, "How hard could it be?"

709
01:03:57,326 --> 01:03:58,327
They're on the ship!

710
01:03:59,161 --> 01:04:00,454
Get to the ship!

711
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:06,752
Well, whatever you're doing, brother,
I suggest you do it faster.

712
01:04:06,836 --> 01:04:08,170
Shut up, Loki.

713
01:04:10,381 --> 01:04:11,566
You must have missed something.

714
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:14,301
No, I didn't.
I'm pressing every button on this thing.

715
01:04:14,385 --> 01:04:15,970
No, don't hit it. Just press it gently.

716
01:04:16,095 --> 01:04:17,930
I'm pressing it gently, it's not working!

717
01:04:25,688 --> 01:04:27,273
Get him! Get him!

718
01:04:56,844 --> 01:04:58,444
- I think you missed a column.
- Shut up!

719
01:05:05,603 --> 01:05:06,913
Look, why don't you let me take over?

720
01:05:06,937 --> 01:05:08,189
I'm clearly the better pilot.

721
01:05:08,481 --> 01:05:10,399
Is that right? Well, out of the two of us,

722
01:05:10,524 --> 01:05:12,026
which one can actually fly?

723
01:05:22,536 --> 01:05:24,121
Oh, dear. Is she dead?

724
01:05:24,205 --> 01:05:25,206
Jane.

725
01:05:25,998 --> 01:05:26,999
I'm okay.

726
01:05:34,131 --> 01:05:35,466
Not a word.

727
01:05:37,593 --> 01:05:38,969
Now they're following us.

728
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:45,476
Now they're firing at us.

729
01:05:45,643 --> 01:05:47,037
Yeah, thank you
for the commentary, Loki,

730
01:05:47,061 --> 01:05:48,395
it's not at all distracting!

731
01:05:52,942 --> 01:05:55,569
Well done.
You just decapitated your grandfather.

732
01:06:06,997 --> 01:06:08,332
You know, this is wonderful.

733
01:06:08,457 --> 01:06:10,751
This is a tremendous idea.

734
01:06:10,918 --> 01:06:14,004
Let's steal the biggest,
most obvious ship in the universe

735
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:15,422
and escape in that.

736
01:06:15,506 --> 01:06:16,674
Flying around the city,

737
01:06:16,757 --> 01:06:19,134
smashing into everything in sight
so everyone can see us.

738
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:20,980
It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant!

739
01:06:35,568 --> 01:06:37,111
I see your time in the dungeons

740
01:06:37,194 --> 01:06:39,780
has made you no less graceful, Loki.

741
01:06:43,993 --> 01:06:45,953
You lied to me.

742
01:06:47,204 --> 01:06:48,581
I'm impressed.

743
01:06:48,664 --> 01:06:50,124
I'm glad you're pleased.

744
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:51,208
Now, do as you promised.

745
01:06:51,292 --> 01:06:53,127
And take us to your secret pathway.

746
01:07:16,358 --> 01:07:17,902
- Fandral.
- Right.

747
01:07:21,614 --> 01:07:22,615
For Asgard.

748
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:29,330
Nothing personal, boys.

749
01:07:44,637 --> 01:07:46,013
Loki...

750
01:07:46,096 --> 01:07:49,433
If it were easy, everyone would do it.

751
01:07:49,516 --> 01:07:51,518
- Are you mad?
- Possibly.

752
01:08:07,117 --> 01:08:08,702
Ta-da!

753
01:08:14,249 --> 01:08:17,586
We must strike now.

754
01:08:18,629 --> 01:08:19,630
No.

755
01:08:21,256 --> 01:08:26,887
Asgard is meaningless.

756
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:33,018
The Aether has found its way home.

757
01:08:48,701 --> 01:08:52,246
What I could do with the power
that flows through those veins.

758
01:08:52,371 --> 01:08:55,040
It would consume you.

759
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,584
She's holding up all right.

760
01:08:58,419 --> 01:08:59,545
For now.

761
01:09:00,087 --> 01:09:02,631
She's strong in ways
you'd never even know.

762
01:09:02,756 --> 01:09:04,091
Say goodbye.

763
01:09:04,174 --> 01:09:05,968
Not this day.

764
01:09:06,093 --> 01:09:08,887
This day, the next,
a hundred years, it's nothing.

765
01:09:10,139 --> 01:09:11,682
It's a heartbeat.

766
01:09:12,099 --> 01:09:14,101
You'll never be ready.

767
01:09:14,518 --> 01:09:16,038
The only woman
whose love you've prized

768
01:09:16,103 --> 01:09:17,896
will be snatched from you.

769
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,273
And will that satisfy you?

770
01:09:19,398 --> 01:09:20,941
Satisfaction is not in my nature.

771
01:09:21,025 --> 01:09:23,235
Surrender is not in mine.

772
01:09:24,028 --> 01:09:25,529
- The son of Odin...
- No.

773
01:09:25,612 --> 01:09:27,656
Not just of Odin.

774
01:09:27,781 --> 01:09:30,117
You think you alone
were loved of Mother?

775
01:09:30,284 --> 01:09:32,286
You had her tricks, but I had her trust.

776
01:09:32,411 --> 01:09:33,704
Trust?

777
01:09:34,621 --> 01:09:36,123
Was that her last expression?

778
01:09:36,749 --> 01:09:38,959
Trust? When you let her die?

779
01:09:39,084 --> 01:09:41,795
- What help were you in your cell?
- Who put me there?

780
01:09:41,879 --> 01:09:43,297
Who put me there?

781
01:09:43,422 --> 01:09:44,423
You know damn well!

782
01:09:45,132 --> 01:09:46,884
You know damn well who!

783
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:55,809
She wouldn't want us to fight.

784
01:09:56,935 --> 01:09:59,480
Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.

785
01:10:04,193 --> 01:10:06,695
I wish I could trust you.

786
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:23,170
Trust my rage.

787
01:10:29,843 --> 01:10:32,721
You'll have to sign
for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig.

788
01:10:33,388 --> 01:10:34,556
What?

789
01:10:34,681 --> 01:10:36,016
Yeah.

790
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:39,103
My father, Dr. Erik Selvig.

791
01:10:40,813 --> 01:10:43,190
One man's leather wallet, brown.

792
01:10:43,273 --> 01:10:45,734
One key ring, three keys.

793
01:10:45,859 --> 01:10:47,778
Prescription medicine...

794
01:10:48,529 --> 01:10:49,780
Various.

795
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:54,201
- And...
- Erik.

796
01:10:55,786 --> 01:10:57,204
- These.
- Yeah.

797
01:10:57,287 --> 01:10:58,497
Those.

798
01:10:58,997 --> 01:11:00,290
Thank goodness.

799
01:11:01,959 --> 01:11:03,168
Erik.

800
01:11:04,962 --> 01:11:06,088
Yes?

801
01:11:06,213 --> 01:11:07,881
It's Darcy.

802
01:11:08,006 --> 01:11:09,091
Darcy.

803
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:13,095
So good to see you.

804
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:14,263
I missed you, too.

805
01:11:14,388 --> 01:11:15,806
How did you find me?

806
01:11:15,889 --> 01:11:17,141
You were naked on TV.

807
01:11:18,517 --> 01:11:20,644
Okay, time to go, lots to do.

808
01:11:22,729 --> 01:11:24,731
Getting weird now.

809
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:28,277
I should not be left in charge
of stuff like this.

810
01:11:28,402 --> 01:11:32,239
I don't get paid enough.
I don't get paid, period.

811
01:11:32,322 --> 01:11:35,325
I'm Ian by the way, Darcy's intern.

812
01:11:35,492 --> 01:11:37,661
Yeah, I don't get paid either.

813
01:11:38,537 --> 01:11:39,997
Are you all right?

814
01:11:40,164 --> 01:11:41,999
I've had a god in my brain.

815
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:44,793
I don't recommend it.

816
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:48,714
Dr. Selvig, sir,
your gear is beeping at me.

817
01:11:48,797 --> 01:11:51,175
It's happening.
It's sooner than I calculated.

818
01:11:51,341 --> 01:11:52,968
Wait. What's happening?

819
01:11:56,263 --> 01:11:57,931
Birds?

820
01:11:58,056 --> 01:11:59,433
Birds are happening?

821
01:11:59,516 --> 01:12:01,768
They're starlings.
It's called a murmuration.

822
01:12:01,935 --> 01:12:04,104
My dad, he used to take me
bird watching as a kid.

823
01:12:04,271 --> 01:12:05,772
- Nerd.
- Look!

824
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,529
Where did they go?

825
01:12:25,334 --> 01:12:27,628
What the hell was that?

826
01:12:28,128 --> 01:12:29,796
Why are you smiling?

827
01:12:29,963 --> 01:12:31,203
There's nothing more reassuring

828
01:12:31,256 --> 01:12:34,968
than realizing that the world
is crazier than you are.

829
01:12:35,052 --> 01:12:37,930
Take me to Jane's lab.

830
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,860
Jane.

831
01:12:58,492 --> 01:12:59,826
Malekith.

832
01:13:22,099 --> 01:13:24,017
All right. Are you ready?

833
01:13:24,184 --> 01:13:25,435
I am.

834
01:13:39,074 --> 01:13:41,177
You know, this plan of yours
is going to get us killed.

835
01:13:41,201 --> 01:13:43,078
Yes, possibly.

836
01:13:46,707 --> 01:13:48,067
You still don't trust me, brother?

837
01:13:49,543 --> 01:13:50,836
Would you?

838
01:13:59,761 --> 01:14:00,971
No, I wouldn't.

839
01:14:05,767 --> 01:14:07,227
Thor!

840
01:14:08,061 --> 01:14:09,646
No!

841
01:14:18,947 --> 01:14:21,408
You really think I cared about Frigga?

842
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:23,201
About any of you?

843
01:14:26,204 --> 01:14:27,205
All I ever wanted

844
01:14:28,707 --> 01:14:29,750
was you and Odin

845
01:14:29,875 --> 01:14:30,959
dead at my feet!

846
01:14:43,597 --> 01:14:44,598
Malekith!

847
01:14:46,683 --> 01:14:48,685
I am Loki of Jotunheim,

848
01:14:48,852 --> 01:14:50,771
and I bring you a gift.

849
01:14:52,731 --> 01:14:54,566
I ask only one thing in return...

850
01:14:54,649 --> 01:14:58,070
A good seat
from which to watch Asgard burn.

851
01:14:58,695 --> 01:15:00,947
He is an enemy of Asgard.

852
01:15:01,031 --> 01:15:03,784
He was a prisoner in their dungeons.

853
01:15:18,006 --> 01:15:19,132
Look at me.

854
01:16:17,149 --> 01:16:18,650
Loki! Now!

855
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:35,138
No!

856
01:19:44,356 --> 01:19:46,483
See you in hell, monster.

857
01:20:05,335 --> 01:20:06,795
No. No, no, no.

858
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:11,383
You fool, you didn't listen.

859
01:20:11,466 --> 01:20:12,467
I know...

860
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:15,679
I'm a fool, I'm a fool.

861
01:20:15,762 --> 01:20:16,930
Stay with me, okay?

862
01:20:17,013 --> 01:20:18,181
I'm sorry.

863
01:20:20,225 --> 01:20:22,435
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

864
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,853
It's okay.

865
01:20:27,482 --> 01:20:28,983
It's all right.

866
01:20:29,109 --> 01:20:32,612
I'll tell Father what you did here today.

867
01:20:35,699 --> 01:20:38,618
I didn't do it for him.

868
01:20:47,168 --> 01:20:49,546
No!

869
01:21:43,349 --> 01:21:45,393
He's going to unleash it.

870
01:21:45,518 --> 01:21:50,690
Not just on Asgard, or on a star.
Malekith is going to destroy everything.

871
01:21:50,815 --> 01:21:51,941
How?

872
01:21:53,026 --> 01:21:54,194
Jane, how?

873
01:21:54,319 --> 01:21:57,530
I saw him on Earth.
Why would he go to Earth?

874
01:21:58,114 --> 01:21:59,491
The Convergence.

875
01:21:59,657 --> 01:22:00,825
Oh, God.

876
01:22:00,909 --> 01:22:03,349
None of this would have happened
if I hadn't found the Aether.

877
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,872
Then Malekith
would've only possessed it

878
01:22:05,997 --> 01:22:07,665
that much sooner.

879
01:22:07,749 --> 01:22:10,210
I only found it
because I was looking for you.

880
01:22:10,835 --> 01:22:12,086
Jane...

881
01:22:13,713 --> 01:22:15,423
Now we're trapped here.

882
01:22:21,971 --> 01:22:23,181
It's not me.

883
01:22:24,474 --> 01:22:25,683
Hello?

884
01:22:25,809 --> 01:22:27,018
Hi, Jane, it's Richard.

885
01:22:27,185 --> 01:22:28,937
Richard? Where are you?

886
01:22:29,062 --> 01:22:30,271
I'm still at the office.

887
01:22:30,396 --> 01:22:32,357
It's been a crazy day here today.

888
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,359
- Oh, my God, this is amazing.
- Is it?

889
01:22:34,484 --> 01:22:35,693
I quite enjoyed our lunch

890
01:22:35,777 --> 01:22:37,862
despite never actually
ordering anything.

891
01:22:37,946 --> 01:22:39,364
How am I getting service here?

892
01:22:39,447 --> 01:22:41,574
Is this a bad time?
Do you want me to try you later?

893
01:22:41,699 --> 01:22:44,869
No, no, no. Please, whatever you do,
do not hang up the phone.

894
01:22:45,745 --> 01:22:46,871
Okay, then.

895
01:22:46,955 --> 01:22:49,332
I was just wondering
if you want to try again.

896
01:22:49,415 --> 01:22:50,875
Maybe dinner next time.

897
01:22:50,959 --> 01:22:52,585
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

898
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:54,963
- Just stay on the phone, okay?
- Yeah, I will.

899
01:22:55,088 --> 01:22:57,048
Oh, my God.

900
01:23:00,927 --> 01:23:02,047
Am I interrupting something?

901
01:23:02,095 --> 01:23:03,805
No, no, no. Nothing at all.

902
01:23:03,972 --> 01:23:04,973
Come on.

903
01:23:05,056 --> 01:23:06,283
I'm losing you there.
Are you in a tunnel?

904
01:23:06,307 --> 01:23:07,725
Where are we going?

905
01:23:07,809 --> 01:23:08,810
Hello?

906
01:23:08,935 --> 01:23:10,770
Why are there so many shoes in here?

907
01:23:12,355 --> 01:23:14,190
I'll just text her.

908
01:23:26,494 --> 01:23:27,662
So, who's Richard?

909
01:23:27,829 --> 01:23:29,289
Really?

910
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:39,090
- Jane!
- Hey.

911
01:23:39,173 --> 01:23:40,925
You can't just leave like that.

912
01:23:41,009 --> 01:23:42,302
The whole world is going crazy.

913
01:23:42,468 --> 01:23:44,304
All the stuff we saw is spreading.

914
01:23:45,805 --> 01:23:47,640
- Did you go to a party?
- Erik?

915
01:23:47,765 --> 01:23:51,436
Jane! How wonderful.

916
01:23:53,646 --> 01:23:55,526
- You've been to Asgard.
- Where are your pants?

917
01:23:55,607 --> 01:23:57,358
He says it helps him think.

918
01:23:57,483 --> 01:23:59,128
Okay, well, I'm going to need
everything you got on this.

919
01:23:59,152 --> 01:24:01,863
All the work you've been doing
on gravimetric anomalies, everything.

920
01:24:01,988 --> 01:24:03,156
Okay.

921
01:24:03,239 --> 01:24:04,324
Are you well, Erik?

922
01:24:05,783 --> 01:24:07,285
Your brother's not coming, is he?

923
01:24:08,286 --> 01:24:09,621
Loki is dead.

924
01:24:09,704 --> 01:24:10,788
Oh, thank God!

925
01:24:11,956 --> 01:24:14,167
I meant, I'm so sorry.

926
01:24:14,292 --> 01:24:15,835
Thank you.

927
01:24:39,442 --> 01:24:41,319
Forgive me, my liege.

928
01:24:42,153 --> 01:24:44,656
I've returned from
the Dark World with news.

929
01:24:47,116 --> 01:24:48,201
Thor?

930
01:24:48,868 --> 01:24:53,289
There was no sign of Thor,
or the weapon, but...

931
01:24:55,124 --> 01:24:56,334
What?

932
01:24:59,295 --> 01:25:00,922
We found a body.

933
01:25:05,635 --> 01:25:06,761
Loki.

934
01:25:10,848 --> 01:25:12,684
Malekith is going to
fire the Aether at a spot

935
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:14,769
where all the nine worlds
are connecting.

936
01:25:14,894 --> 01:25:17,355
Amplifying the weapon's impact.

937
01:25:17,438 --> 01:25:18,856
For each additional world,

938
01:25:18,982 --> 01:25:21,067
the power will increase exponentially.

939
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:24,237
The effect would be universal.

940
01:25:24,362 --> 01:25:25,989
But the Alignment is only temporary.

941
01:25:26,072 --> 01:25:29,117
He must be in
exactly the right place at the right time.

942
01:25:29,242 --> 01:25:30,910
Well, how do we know where that is?

943
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:34,539
We follow the directions.

944
01:25:34,706 --> 01:25:35,957
This has happened before

945
01:25:36,082 --> 01:25:39,419
thousands of years ago,
and the Ancients were there to see it.

946
01:25:40,086 --> 01:25:41,462
All the great constructions,

947
01:25:42,296 --> 01:25:45,008
the Mayans, the Chinese,
the Egyptians.

948
01:25:45,091 --> 01:25:48,511
They made use of the gravitational
effects of the Convergence.

949
01:25:48,594 --> 01:25:50,680
And they left us a map.

950
01:25:50,763 --> 01:25:52,181
Stonehenge,

951
01:25:53,641 --> 01:25:54,684
Snowdon,

952
01:25:54,767 --> 01:25:55,935
the Great Orme.

953
01:25:56,019 --> 01:25:57,895
These are all coordinates taking us...

954
01:25:59,272 --> 01:26:00,273
Here.

955
01:26:02,775 --> 01:26:04,235
Greenwich?

956
01:26:04,318 --> 01:26:06,946
The walls between worlds
will be almost non-existent.

957
01:26:07,113 --> 01:26:08,433
Physics is going to go ballistic.

958
01:26:08,489 --> 01:26:10,324
Increases and decreases in gravity,

959
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:11,909
spatial extrusions.

960
01:26:11,993 --> 01:26:14,620
The very fabric of reality
is going to be torn apart.

961
01:26:17,874 --> 01:26:20,126
I better get my pants.

962
01:26:21,711 --> 01:26:23,046
Focus! This is important.

963
01:26:23,212 --> 01:26:24,773
We have to hammer them in
all around the site

964
01:26:24,797 --> 01:26:27,091
and then Jane and Erik
will activate them from the tower.

965
01:26:27,425 --> 01:26:28,885
They're taped together.

966
01:26:29,093 --> 01:26:31,387
Do you even know
what these things do?

967
01:26:31,763 --> 01:26:33,389
No.

968
01:26:33,723 --> 01:26:34,724
Neither do I.

969
01:26:43,524 --> 01:26:45,526
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Right.

970
01:26:58,331 --> 01:26:59,332
Holy...

971
01:26:59,457 --> 01:27:00,458
Shit.

972
01:28:18,995 --> 01:28:21,289
You needn't have come
so far, Asgardian.

973
01:28:21,414 --> 01:28:23,624
Death would've come to you
soon enough.

974
01:28:23,749 --> 01:28:25,251
Not by your hand.

975
01:28:25,334 --> 01:28:28,087
Your universe was never meant to be.

976
01:28:28,171 --> 01:28:31,257
Your world and your family

977
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:33,467
will be extinguished!

978
01:28:35,678 --> 01:28:37,096
We're running out of time.

979
01:28:37,221 --> 01:28:39,557
- Almost there.
- Are you sure this is going to work?

980
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:42,226
These devices were made
to detect anomalies, not cause them.

981
01:28:43,269 --> 01:28:44,353
Come on.

982
01:28:49,609 --> 01:28:51,736
Come on, Darcy.

983
01:29:02,163 --> 01:29:04,123
You know, with all that power,

984
01:29:04,248 --> 01:29:05,750
I thought you'd hit harder.

985
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:32,235
Done.

986
01:29:39,158 --> 01:29:41,869
The Convergence
will be in full effect in seven minutes.

987
01:29:41,994 --> 01:29:44,194
That just means we have to
keep Malekith busy for eight.

988
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:52,546
Okay, you might want to
hold on to something.

989
01:29:58,219 --> 01:29:59,595
That is awesome!

990
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:01,180
How did you do that?

991
01:30:01,264 --> 01:30:02,556
Well, the gravitational fields

992
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,934
interact with the weak spots
between worlds, creating...

993
01:30:05,017 --> 01:30:06,435
Get the guy with the sword!

994
01:30:09,855 --> 01:30:11,732
Let's go.

995
01:30:13,693 --> 01:30:15,403
What the hell just happened?

996
01:30:16,195 --> 01:30:17,196
Move!

997
01:30:34,964 --> 01:30:36,257
What are you all doing?

998
01:30:36,382 --> 01:30:38,050
You need to get out of here, now!

999
01:30:38,175 --> 01:30:39,719
You're joking, right?

1000
01:30:39,844 --> 01:30:40,844
That's Thor out there.

1001
01:30:40,886 --> 01:30:43,014
He's waving his hammer around
and everything!

1002
01:32:01,384 --> 01:32:02,885
Confirming ship is hostile.

1003
01:32:03,052 --> 01:32:04,929
Confirmed, ship is hostile.

1004
01:32:05,012 --> 01:32:06,430
You have permission to engage.

1005
01:32:06,514 --> 01:32:07,723
Roger.

1006
01:32:07,807 --> 01:32:08,933
Missiles locked.

1007
01:32:09,767 --> 01:32:11,519
Missiles away.

1008
01:32:12,978 --> 01:32:14,146
Missiles off target.

1009
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:16,941
I repeat, target missed.
I'm losing control.

1010
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:19,819
Mayday! Mayday! Lost positive control.

1011
01:32:21,946 --> 01:32:22,947
What are you doing?

1012
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:24,532
My signal's not connecting.

1013
01:32:26,826 --> 01:32:27,827
Jane!

1014
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:28,994
Come on.

1015
01:33:11,287 --> 01:33:12,580
Are you all right?

1016
01:33:12,746 --> 01:33:13,747
You saved my life.

1017
01:33:17,376 --> 01:33:18,377
Yeah.

1018
01:33:18,461 --> 01:33:19,753
I guess I did.

1019
01:33:29,013 --> 01:33:31,223
- Darcy?
- Jane!

1020
01:33:31,348 --> 01:33:33,684
- Ian!
- Selvig!

1021
01:33:34,226 --> 01:33:35,394
Mew mew!

1022
01:33:39,023 --> 01:33:40,900
Mind the gap.

1023
01:33:43,152 --> 01:33:44,192
How do I get to Greenwich?

1024
01:33:45,237 --> 01:33:47,239
Take this train. Three stops.

1025
01:33:49,325 --> 01:33:51,827
Mind the gap.

1026
01:33:53,746 --> 01:33:55,706
Sorry. Sorry.

1027
01:34:33,202 --> 01:34:34,870
- We're out of time.
- Jane.

1028
01:34:35,996 --> 01:34:37,122
Jane!

1029
01:35:03,065 --> 01:35:04,483
Thor!

1030
01:35:05,484 --> 01:35:06,527
We're too late.

1031
01:35:07,903 --> 01:35:09,989
The Convergence is at its peak.

1032
01:35:10,864 --> 01:35:11,991
Can those things stop him?

1033
01:35:12,116 --> 01:35:13,200
Not from here.

1034
01:35:13,367 --> 01:35:16,161
We can't get close enough.

1035
01:35:17,204 --> 01:35:18,455
I can.

1036
01:35:43,772 --> 01:35:44,773
Malekith!

1037
01:35:52,156 --> 01:35:55,409
Darkness returns, Asgardian.

1038
01:35:55,534 --> 01:35:58,829
Have you come
to witness the end of your universe?

1039
01:35:58,912 --> 01:36:00,956
I've come to accept your surrender.

1040
01:36:20,517 --> 01:36:22,603
You think you can stop this?

1041
01:36:23,312 --> 01:36:26,106
The Aether cannot be destroyed.

1042
01:36:26,231 --> 01:36:27,900
But you can.

1043
01:37:13,445 --> 01:37:15,447
Thor! No.

1044
01:37:25,791 --> 01:37:26,834
Jane!

1045
01:37:57,531 --> 01:37:59,116
Everybody okay?

1046
01:38:43,702 --> 01:38:45,621
He's gonna come back.

1047
01:38:48,123 --> 01:38:50,000
Except, you know,

1048
01:38:50,125 --> 01:38:52,294
last time he was gone for,
like, two years.

1049
01:38:52,377 --> 01:38:54,296
Well, it's only been two days, so...

1050
01:38:56,215 --> 01:38:58,050
Did he say anything before he left?

1051
01:38:58,175 --> 01:39:00,344
Yeah, he had to figure
some stuff out with his father.

1052
01:39:00,427 --> 01:39:04,556
He kinda committed treason...
On our way out.

1053
01:39:13,065 --> 01:39:17,736
You once said there
would never be a wiser king than me.

1054
01:39:17,903 --> 01:39:18,904
You were wrong.

1055
01:39:19,488 --> 01:39:23,367
The Alignment has brought
all the realms together.

1056
01:39:23,450 --> 01:39:26,578
Every one of them
saw you offer your life to save them.

1057
01:39:27,246 --> 01:39:31,667
What can Asgard offer
its new king in return?

1058
01:39:32,835 --> 01:39:34,711
My life.

1059
01:39:35,838 --> 01:39:38,549
Father, I cannot be king of Asgard.

1060
01:39:38,632 --> 01:39:43,428
I will protect Asgard and all the realms
with my last and every breath,

1061
01:39:43,554 --> 01:39:45,806
but I cannot do so from that chair.

1062
01:39:45,931 --> 01:39:50,060
Loki, for all his grave imbalance,
understood rule as I know I never will.

1063
01:39:51,061 --> 01:39:53,730
The brutality, the sacrifice...

1064
01:39:53,897 --> 01:39:55,357
It changes you.

1065
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:58,861
I'd rather be a good man
than a great king.

1066
01:39:59,444 --> 01:40:04,241
Is this my son I hear,
or the woman he loves?

1067
01:40:04,324 --> 01:40:06,869
When you speak,
do I never hear Mother's voice?

1068
01:40:08,871 --> 01:40:11,415
This is not for Jane, Father.

1069
01:40:11,498 --> 01:40:13,917
She does not know
what I came here to say.

1070
01:40:14,001 --> 01:40:17,337
Now, forbid me to see her,
or say she can rule at my side.

1071
01:40:17,462 --> 01:40:18,797
It changes nothing.

1072
01:40:19,381 --> 01:40:22,718
One son
who wanted the throne too much,

1073
01:40:23,635 --> 01:40:25,762
another who will not take it.

1074
01:40:26,305 --> 01:40:28,056
Is this my legacy?

1075
01:40:28,223 --> 01:40:29,808
Loki died with honor.

1076
01:40:30,767 --> 01:40:32,144
I shall try to live the same.

1077
01:40:32,227 --> 01:40:33,645
Is that not legacy enough?

1078
01:40:44,656 --> 01:40:46,992
It belongs to you.

1079
01:40:47,743 --> 01:40:49,494
If you are worthy of it.

1080
01:40:49,578 --> 01:40:52,080
I shall try to be.

1081
01:40:53,498 --> 01:40:58,211
I cannot give you my blessing,
nor can I wish you good fortune.

1082
01:40:59,171 --> 01:41:00,839
I know.

1083
01:41:03,675 --> 01:41:07,012
If I were proud of
the man my son had become,

1084
01:41:07,512 --> 01:41:09,848
even that, I could not say.

1085
01:41:12,351 --> 01:41:15,979
It would speak only from my heart.

1086
01:41:17,356 --> 01:41:18,774
Go,

1087
01:41:19,858 --> 01:41:21,360
my son.

1088
01:41:23,487 --> 01:41:24,738
Thank you, Father.

1089
01:41:40,337 --> 01:41:41,380
No.

1090
01:41:42,714 --> 01:41:44,383
Thank you.

1091
01:44:02,395 --> 01:44:04,815
I present to you,

1092
01:44:05,524 --> 01:44:09,027
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.

1093
01:44:14,783 --> 01:44:19,329
Asgardians, it's an honor.

1094
01:44:23,041 --> 01:44:25,127
You know why we're here.

1095
01:44:28,839 --> 01:44:30,757
Of course.

1096
01:44:31,591 --> 01:44:33,844
But, if I may ask,

1097
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:37,889
why not keep it secure
in your own vault?

1098
01:44:38,014 --> 01:44:40,934
The Tesseract is already on Asgard.

1099
01:44:41,059 --> 01:44:44,604
It is not wise to keep
two Infinity Stones so close together.

1100
01:44:45,230 --> 01:44:47,732
That's very wise.

1101
01:44:57,576 --> 01:44:58,952
I can assure you,

1102
01:45:00,203 --> 01:45:05,417
it will be absolutely safe here,

1103
01:45:07,627 --> 01:45:10,130
in my collection.

1104
01:45:11,298 --> 01:45:13,717
See that it is.

1105
01:45:32,277 --> 01:45:34,779
One down.

1106
01:45:36,281 --> 01:45:38,783
Five to go.
