1
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:17,916
<i>Gandía was an animal.</i>

2
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,958
<i>After almost killing two of his prey,</i>

3
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,541
<i>he could've retreated to his den
and rested.</i>

4
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,458
<i>But that would have been
against his nature.</i>

5
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:34,625
<i>He was a predator.</i>

6
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:39,041
<i>And he wasn't going to stop
until he finished off the entire flock.</i>

7
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,250
Nairobi.

8
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:51,833
Fuck!

9
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,083
Rio, Denver, with me. Let's go.

10
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,750
This vent goes to
the bathrooms downstairs.

11
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,041
Denver, you okay?
You'll climb through there?

12
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,325
- Sure.
- I'll go too.

13
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,333
Go, kill that son of a bitch.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's go.

15
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:42,000
<i>Don't move or I'll kill her!</i>

16
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,458
- Don't move! Nobody move!
- Where are you shot?

17
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,083
In my hand.

18
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,666
The next bullet
goes straight into her head!

19
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:50,166
<i>♪ If I stay with you
If I'm choosing wrong ♪</i>

20
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,083

28
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:43,333
- Merry Christmas!
- What do you mean?

29
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,708
It feels like Christmas Eve.
Don't you think?

30
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,333
We're here with all this food,
setting the table,

31
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,458
- waiting for the rest of the family.
- Not just family,

32
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,750
don't forget there's Manila
and the welders.

33
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,375
- It's good for you to get to know them.
- Of course.

34
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,875
They're like distant cousins.

35
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,208
You know why I came back for this heist?

36
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,916
Before you scattered us all across
the world,

37
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,416
this gang...

38
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:15,000
was the closest thing to a family
I've had in my whole life.

39
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:19,458
I've never had a Christmas
like the kind you see on TV

40
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,291
with Grandma, Santa, cookies,
all that shit.

41
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,708
- And Axel's father? Didn't you celebrate...
- No.

42
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,041
You know, I...

43
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,791
I had already given up on the idea...

44
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,000
of having a family.

45
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,541
Completely given it up.

46
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,833
But now I think
there's another way of doing this thing.

47
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,000
I have this urge to be a mother.

48
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,833
But a different one.
I wanna have a bunch of kids,

49
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,166
and a dog and whatever else I want.

50
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,083
What you're saying is beautiful, Nairobi.
Very beautiful.

51
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,083
Y-you...

52
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,791
Would you be the father of my child?

53
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,083
- I mean...
- Pardon?

54
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,916
I need to get good genes
to combine with mine. It's very important.

55
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,583
I look at you in class,

56
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,291
and I think...

57
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,500
"This man is brilliant,

58
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,208
and he's honorable,

59
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,041
and so sensitive. Even handsome.

60
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,458
He's a man with ideals."

61
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,125
And I believe in what you do.

62
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,583
Your perception of me
is very, very flattering.

63
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,833
And honorable...

64
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,083
Well, that's one way to look at it, but...

65
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,291
that's impossible.

66
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,068
Why? Impossible is pulling off a heist
at the Bank of Spain.

67
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,458
I'm not asking you to be a father
if you don't want to.

68
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,208
What I'm asking is a donation

69
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,083
so I can do things differently.

70
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,500
- No strings attached.
- Nairobi...

71
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:11,166
Listen, I set up the heist
at the Royal Mint

72
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,500
in memory of my father.

73
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,583
And this one, for my brother. I'm...

74
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,666
I'm not one
who doesn't develop attachments.

75
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,166
I would not ignore, even for a second,

76
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,333
the fact that I have a child out there
somewhere in the world.

77
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,666
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

78
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,708
You were the one that built this family.
And you...

79
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,916
you taught us to look out for each other.

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,625
You said, "Whatever it takes."

81
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:39,541
- But what you're asking for is...
- What I'm asking you is the same.

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,916
Because a family is there for you,
no questions asked.

83
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,416
That's what binds us.
They will risk their lives for you.

84
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,083
You've got your plan,

85
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,625
but I also have a plan.

86
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,250
You've taught me
that we have to help each other

87
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,000
because that's who we are.

88
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,750
Ágata...

89
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,333
I guess I've asked you
to do more complicated things.

90
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,458
A little bit more, yeah.

91
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,458
And...

92
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,041
I've done fucked up shit for you
without asking.

93
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,791
I know. I've asked you...

94
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,666
to take big risks.

95
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,416
Serious risks.

96
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,750
In fact, much more
than what you're asking me now.

97
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,083
Are you saying that's a yes?

98
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,916
You're saying that's a yes.

99
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,416
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

100
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,833
Come here!

101
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,125
Thank you. Thank you.

102
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,750
Thank you! I swear to you,
you're never going to regret this.

103
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:00,125
We will find the best in vitro
fertilization clinics in the world.

104
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,833
Or, if you want,
we could do it the traditional way.

105
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,166
The traditional way is for sure
off the table.

106
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,333
We'll leave in the hands of professionals.
Okay?

107
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,416
Okay.

108
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,916
We'll do it once we've finished the heist.

109
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,416
Right.

110
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,125
This is gonna be amazing.

111
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,875
You're doing very well, mutt.

112
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,083
You look like Jesus Christ.

113
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,250
How's your hand? You okay?

114
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,375
I am loaded with morphine.

115
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,958
- <i>Have you found Tokyo?</i>
- She's still locked in the panic room.

116
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,500
Ssh!

117
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,541
We're making too much noise.

118
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,166
We have to take off our boots.

119
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,000
What was that?

120
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,208
Look.

121
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,333
Stay still. Don't!

122
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,250
What the fuck?

123
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,958
Move! Move!

124
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,625
Rio, Denver, you okay?

125
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,916
We got to cover.

126
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,083
You can't escape!

127
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,416
And who the fuck said I wanna escape,
you one-eyed queer?

128
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,833
This is where all the fun happens.

129
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,166
How many clips you have left,
little soldier?

130
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,875
Why don't you come in here and count them?

131
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,166
Bring the drills!
Make some fucking holes in the walls.

132
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,333
For each wall hole,

133
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,041
I'll make another in you.

134
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,791
He won't kill me.

135
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,500
If he kills me, you kill him.
And he knows it.

136
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,726
Palermo, she's right.
We have to take this opportunity.

137
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,583
No. He's gonna keep shooting her.
It's way too risky.

138
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,708
Gandía!

139
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,291
You know what's gonna happen?

140
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,666
When this is over,
you're gonna get killed by two queers.

141
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,958
What do you think
is worse?

142
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,458
Getting killed by a one-eyed <i>sudaca</i>
or a Serbian?

143
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,250
Helsinki, promise me
you'll rip this fucker apart.

144
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,666
I fuckin' swear it, Nairobi. I swear it.

145
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,083
What are all your buddies at the gun club
gonna say, Gandía, huh?

146
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,125
You'll end up
getting slaughtered by a teddy bear!

147
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,875
Nairobi, save your strength.

148
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,791
You're making my hostage nervous,

149
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:20,333
and I want her to stay calm,
so we're going to start singing now.

150
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,000
I want to hear everyone
so I can know where you are.

151
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,583
And for every person I don't hear singing,
one bullet.

152
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,166
Huh, Nairobi? Come on.

153
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,541
You're gonna start.
Do you know the song "The Fisher of Men"?

154
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,375
You'd better stop kicking me,
you goddamn stupid bitch. Sing!

155
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,375
Let's sing!

156
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:39,958

I told you to sing, and anyone

00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,125
<i>That song sounded like a requiem.</i>

174
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,125
<i>A requiem for our own funeral.</i>

175
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,041
<i>And that bitter reality...</i>

176
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,708
<i>woke the Professor up.</i>

177
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,875
We're up against the ropes.

178
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,791
Nairobi is knocked out.

179
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,291
Tokyo is knocked out.

180
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,375
Lisbon is knocked out.

181
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,083
Professor.

182
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:12,208
Marseille, I can't think clearly.
I have too many emotional attachments.

183
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,041
Before, I had a gang of people
with city names. Now...

184
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,166
now I could be having a child,
not with one,

185
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,291
but with two members of the gang.

186
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:24,375
Mixing professional
and personal doesn't work.

187
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,500
Tokyo is stuck in the panic room.

188
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,041
And that is precisely the place...

189
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,750
where Gandía... intends... to hide.

190
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,916
We need to find that room
and give him no way to escape.

191
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,208
So where would you put a panic room?

192
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,958
In a place you need to protect.
Where the gold is.

193
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,041
No.

194
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,083
These rooms are used to protect lives,
not gold.

195
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,126
Whose life is most important
in the Bank of Spain?

196
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,500
- The governor's.
- Exactly.

197
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,250
It must be close to the governor's office.

198
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,708
But why doesn't it show up in the plans?

199
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,791
- Perhaps there was a renovation.
- No.

200
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,791
Palermo, don't respond.

201
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,250
<i>The panic room
is behind the governor's bathroom.</i>

202
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,333
<i>It's not in the official blueprints.</i>

203
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:26,166
I bet they falsified the measurements
of the adjoining rooms, but trust me

204
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,541
it's there.

205
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,916
- They're singing church music.
- Huh?

206
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,375
That's a bad omen, yeah?

207
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,875
These assholes sing all the time.
They like doing that kind of shit.

208
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,375
On the other hand,
those shots we heard... Yeah.

209
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,041
That could be a sign these bastards
aren't doing so well.

210
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,142
- Don't you think so, Governor?
- How could we know?

211
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,208
Ssh!

212
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,625
I know. The shouting, the grenades,

213
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:59,416
and that random guy watching us.
I have no damn clue who he is,

214
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,375
but he's the tiniest piece of shit
in the gang, and that's a fact.

215
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,791
We should take advantage of our moment.

216
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,875
We should tip the scales in our favor.

217
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,583
A push, a simple tiny push,
could bring us a little closer to victory.

218
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,875
- Ssh!
- If you permit me, Governor,

219
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,875
I think that that tiny little push
is our responsibility. Yours and mine.

220
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,041
The two of us have to be the ones that...

221
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,250
save the people in this room.

222
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,375
What we have to do

223
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,875
- is remain calm and wait.
- Fuck!

224
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,333
Shut up back there!
I hear you again, I'll start shooting!

225
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,500
I'll have to disagree with you,
Mr. Governor.

226
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,625
See, it is your responsibility.

227
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,666
You just happen to be
the governor of the Bank of Spain!

228
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,916
It's your responsibility as a man. Fuck!

229
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,458
Make your own decisions,
face your problems,

230
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,041
and like I always say,

231
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:52,750
sometimes it's better to get up
and die on your feet than to live...

232
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,416
forever and eternally kneeling.

233
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,125
- You want me to tell you what I think?
- Please do.

234
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,166
I think you're a clown.

235
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,833
You put everyone at risk
with your little adventures

236
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:09,083
and with your stupid
asinine infomercial speeches.

237
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,833
Leave us in peace.

238
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,625
And if you want to die on your feet,

239
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,916
then stand up and do it.

240
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,250
Grenades,

241
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,750
shooting.

242
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,250
All in six minutes.

243
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,833
And look at you so relaxed.
What am I missing, Tamayo?

244
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,541
- I know just as much as you, Alicia.
- Liar.

245
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,166
- What's going on in there?
- I said I didn't know.

246
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,875
Then why aren't we intervening?

247
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,666
When there's shots, the protocol says
we should intervene immediately.

248
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,708
It's Gandía,

249
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,666
- the head of security.
- Oh, fuck.

250
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,958
He's inside, free and armed.
He's acting alone on his own accord.

251
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,250
Wait a minute.
Did you talk to him, or what?

252
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,166
Mm-hmm.

253
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,250
You gave him the green light
to start a war in there and kill everyone?

254
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,458
My official command
was he remain inactive.

255
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,416
He said he didn't give a shit
and plans to defend himself.

256
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,500
And if he wants to defend himself,
I'm not going to stop him.

257
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,958
You piece of shit, Tamayo.
Out there, you look like a saint.

258
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:16,916
Worried about your image in the eyes
of the public, calling a pointless truce.

259
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,583
In the meantime, you send some crazy fuck
to do all the dirty work.

260
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,833
If it goes well, you'll get a medal.
If it goes wrong, you'll say,

261
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,291
"Shit. I told him, no,
but you know he was fucking <i>loco."</i>

262
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,855
It's always us, the fucking crazy ones,
doing the dirty work...

263
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:32,166
Wait. Do you have anything against Gandía
starting a war in there?

264
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,416
Do you have anything against him
hurting them or killing them?

265
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,583
No, right?

266
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,916
It's better we keep our mouths shut.

267
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,791
- Are you thinking, Professor?
- Um, Yes. I'm thinking, yes.

268
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,083
- What about...
- When was...

269
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,416
the first moment that we lost control?

270
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,791
<i>When Denver went out with the red boxes
instead of Gandía.</i>

271
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,290
- And the second time?
<i>- We have a problem.</i>

272
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,333
When Lisbon wasn't able to climb...
the tree.

273
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,791
Those were the two mistakes
that put us against the ropes.

274
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:14,083
We need to take a step back...

275
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,250
and reverse them.

276
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,958
I'm gonna exercise
to get my brain working.

277
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,041
Palermo.

278
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,833
Hang in there. Got it?

279
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,708
<i>Hang in there.</i>

280
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,750
Motherfucker!

281
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,416
Arturo!

282
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,416
I have something to help with
that push you were talking about.

283
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
What?

284
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,083
- It's a cellphone.
- No! Hide it. Holy fuck!

285
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,083
It's Nairobi's.
The one sent in by the police.

286
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,875
I found it while cleaning.

287
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,583
You'll know what to do with it.

288
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,083
What the fuck is going on back there?

289
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,666
If I hear one more fuckin' breath,
I'll shoot you.

290
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,916
Sir, I need to go to the bathroom. Now.

291
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,166
Now is not the time.
No one's gonna leave here,

292
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,208
so you're gonna sit down and stay calm.

293
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,166
You go first.

294
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,541
- Thanks very much.
- No problem.

295
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,333
What's up, Daniel?

296
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,601
- I was in the middle of my meal...
- No, no. Not Daniel.

297
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,708
Not Daniel. Here... Here, I'm Denver.

298
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,000
Okay? Denver.

299
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,291
I'm sorry. It's hard to get used
to your new identity. I'm sorry.

300
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,375
Hmm. Well, that, uh...

301
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,250
- Look, there's just a couple of things...
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,166
...that I'd like to understand,
and it's not easy for me.

303
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,250
Ask away.
I'm the same person I've always been.

304
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,416
Well, not exactly the same person
because now you've got tits.

305
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,291
- Hmm, well...
- Yeah, you've got tits.

306
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,208
- I got tits. Mm-hmm.
- You're a woman.

307
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,000
That part is already clear for me.

308
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,000
Are you gay too?
Or how does that stuff work?

309
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:41,500
So, what you're worried about right now
is knowing whether I'm into guys or not?

310
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,750
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

311
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,625
Hmm. Well, I like men. It's true, yeah.

312
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,833
- I like them a lot, actually.
- Right. Okay.

313
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,583
But hang on.
I don't like just any kind of man.

314
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:56,083
Um, I like them strong, you know?
I like gym rats.

315
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:59,750
Punks, but they have to read
a little bit too so I can learn from them.

316
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,250
Um... They have to watch football.
I like that.

317
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,833
But they have to watch like a true macho,
you know,

318
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,416
with a beer in their hand
and their legs spread wide open...

319
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,583
Okay, okay. I got it already.
I got it. It's crystal clear.

320
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:11,958
Have you...

321
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,375
Have you always liked men,

322
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,791
or did this happen
after you became a woman?

323
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,875
First of all,

324
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,666
I've always been a woman.

325
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
No.

326
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,250
You haven't always been a woman.
I saw you rob gas stations.

327
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,500
- You weren't a woman.
- How does a woman rob?

328
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,875
Do they scratch people
and pull their hair?

329
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,083
I'm not a Neanderthal.
What I'm talking about, it's just that,

330
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,583
usually you can tell it's a woman.
You can tell.

331
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,833
I went on all these robberies
with Juanito, not a woman.

332
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:41,166
Right?
Maybe this thing about being a woman...

333
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,000
happened later.

334
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,000
Let me tell you something.

335
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,375
When Juanito
got out of a robbery with you,

336
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,791
- he'd go back home into his room.
- Yeah.

337
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,833
He'd put on a little music.

338
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,625
He'd roll a little joint...

339
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:04,416
...and put on some red lipstick.
Italian lipstick. It looked wonderful.

340
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,416
Ferrari red.
And he'd take his little joint,

341
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,250
and he'd lie down on the bed...

342
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,416
and right there in that moment...

343
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:18,333
alone, relaxed, looking gorgeous...

344
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,625
...that was the moment I was me, for real.

345
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,041
You've always been a woman.

346
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,208
Always.

347
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,166
And I never realized.

348
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,416
Do you know
who made me really horny back then?

349
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,250
Of course I know.

350
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,458
- Yeah?
- Of course I do.

351
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,833
David Beckham.
You talked about him all day.

352
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:45,333
- Fucking David Beckham.
- Beckham, too. I mean, he's sexy, but no.

353
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:46,833
Um, you.

354
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,166
You turn me on so much.

355
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,875
I didn't turn you on at all.

356
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,838
- I was in love with you.
- What are you saying?

357
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,375
- You don't mess around with love.
- Think about it.

358
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:02,142
Why do you think I was with you
all day long, doing jobs or whatever?

359
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,166
To be close to you.

360
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,833
- Are you being serious?
- Of course. What do you mean?

361
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:09,101
I'd grope you all the time on the bike.
I touched you all day, you never noticed.

362
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,333
- I'd touch your leg, your back...
- Stop.

363
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:13,336
- And your smell!
- Wait a second! Okay, hold on.

364
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:16,541
Do you even realize what you're saying?
This is really serious.

365
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,250
You were taking advantage of me.

366
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,916
I'm screwing with you, moron.

367
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,541
- It's just...
- Mother...

368
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,166
Motherfucker!

369
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,291
Come on. Give me a hug.

370
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,416
I'm sorry, sir,
but I'm not gonna piss myself.

371
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,666
Nobody move!
I don't wanna hear a fuckin' sound! Hey!

372
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:51,583
Hey!

373
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,708
Miguel... Miguel, listen.

374
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:59,000
We need to figure out a way
to communicate safely with the outside.

375
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,083
You get it?

376
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,750
Take it. Hide it.

377
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,000
Keep it. They'll always
be suspicious of me, but not you.

378
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,958
- What are you doing here?
- What the fuck?

379
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,875
What's happening? Where's Denver?

380
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,541
- Denver's fine.
- Who's there?

381
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,625
- It's a hostage.
- Get her out now, Matías!

382
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:26,166
- Let's go.
- Fuck, no. I'm staying. Give me a gun.

383
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,500
That's not why you're here, Manila.
Get going.

384
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,708
You guys are in trouble. Give me a pistol.

385
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:36,166
Get out of here right now.

386
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:37,750
Let's fucking go.

387
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:39,958
It's okay.

388
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,916
Look, from this moment on,

389
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,708
you and I are gonna be
the main part of the resistance.

390
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:55,248
I'm gonna have a heart attack
just listening to you.

391
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,333
<i>Denver.</i>

392
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:11,833
<i>It'll take four seconds at most.</i>

393
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,541
One goes for it.
The other stays and covers.

394
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:16,625
<i>And we save Nairobi.</i>

395
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:18,458
<i>Gandía. What do you want?</i>

396
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:20,416
<i>- Let's negotiate.
- Negotiate?</i>

397
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,625
Look, let me explain the situation.

398
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,125
Option one:

399
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:27,666
I come out of this room with the gun
pointed at Nairobi's head.

400
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:31,166
<i>All of you stay back
against the wall on the right.</i>

401
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,791
<i>I let her go, and nobody dies.</i>

402
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:37,375
<i>It's a good deal for both sides.
Zero-zero. A tie.</i>

403
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,125
<i>Option number two:</i>

404
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:42,375
<i>instead of me going out, you come in.</i>

405
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,708
I blow Nairobi's head off her neck.

406
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:46,625
<i>You shoot me.</i>

407
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:49,291
I'd still have another hand left
to shoot at you,

408
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:52,541
and I swear to God, I'm gonna take
more than one of you with me.

409
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:54,041
You forgot option three.

410
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:57,791
<i>You come out on your knees, unarmed,
and surrender and give us Nairobi.</i>

411
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:59,875
That's also a tie. What do you think?

412
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,583
I wouldn't kneel down,
not even before God Almighty.

413
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:05,666
<i>I'll give you one minute.
After that, I'll start shooting.</i>

414
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,500
<i>And I'll score at least six-zero.</i>

415
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:10,583
<i>You fucking moron!</i>

416
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:13,125
Gandía,
you're not getting out of this alive.

417
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:16,750
You're a fucking clown.
The other day...

418
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:21,250
when Tokyo and I broke in,
we made you look like such an idiot.

419
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,583
Shut up.

420
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,416
And Tokyo...

421
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,000
...used the dumbest fucking trick
with the water.

422
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,958
Shut your fucking mouth right now.

423
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:30,916
You fucking ate

424
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,750
- the door handle.
- Shut up!

425
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,458
You got knocked out so hard...

426
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:36,458
What is she doing?

427
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:40,416
What happened
to your little macho balls then, huh?

428
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:44,000
- So amateur.
- She wants to save Tokyo.

429
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:45,958
You're useless!

430
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:48,375
She knows that if he kills her,
we'll kill him.

431
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:52,125
You've been training for this
your whole fucking life, right?

432
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:54,583
<i>You had all your little soldier friends,</i>

433
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:57,541
then two girls show up and make a fool
of you like that.

434
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,250
- Want me to shoot you right now?
- Surprise me.

435
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:03,291
How about I put a bullet up your asshole?

436
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,500
We have to get her out.
We have to get her out now.

437
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,625
If we let him get out of there,

438
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:23,791
<i>he's gonna do whatever he wants.
I don't trust his word,</i>

439
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,583
- we have to be patient.
<i>- Fuck your patience.</i>

440
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:29,708
<i>She's in there because of you.
You helped him get free.</i>

441
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:31,375
<i>We have to get her out.</i>

442
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:33,166
<i>Everyone agree?</i>

443
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:38,916
Okay, Gandía.

444
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,000
<i>We're gonna let you out.</i>

445
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,041
Okay. Very good.

446
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:45,000
<i>This is how it's gonna go...</i>

447
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:47,208
<i>You'll be seeing Nairobi the entire time.</i>

448
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:51,291
We're gonna walk forward together
as I point my gun against her head,

449
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:55,333
<i>until she confirms everyone's standing
against the wall in the corridor,</i>

450
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:59,333
starting with
those two little fucking kids up there!

451
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:02,833
Denver, Rio, hear that?

452
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:05,416
- <i>You have to come down here.</i>
- Okay, okay, okay.

453
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:22,416
Earlier, you asked me if my husband
was too disgusted to sleep with me,

454
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,541
and I didn't answer.

455
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:25,291
Well, no.

456
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:27,791
I didn't disgust him.

457
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,208
Because I wasn't a bitch back then.

458
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:39,541
But now I guess I am.

459
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,041
And yeah, we had sex.

460
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,458
We did it everywhere.

461
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:47,833
And it's fascinating how creative we were.

462
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:52,500
I imagine you and the Professor are more
like a once a month kind of couple, right?

463
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:53,916
And always missionary.

464
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,541
Money can't buy it all.

465
00:28:56,416 --> 00:29:00,166
All that poison inside of you
is eating you away, Alicia.

466
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:02,208
I can see it in your face.

467
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,291
What's wrong? My face?

468
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:13,458
You're not yourself.
All this talk about sex. What's wrong?

469
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:14,666
Is it the hormones?

470
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,916
I don't know. Download an app.

471
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,666
There's a million perverts
who'd like to fuck a pregnant lady.

472
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,875
I prefer getting to know the other person.

473
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:25,000
I don't date the first geek
that I meet at a bar

474
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:27,416
that gives me his phone and says...

475
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,750
"Hey, gorgeous. Why don't you come with me
to my warehouse

476
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:33,000
and taste my cider?
It's really tasty."

477
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:34,750
You know what your problem is?

478
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:37,750
- Tell me.
- If your mask crumbles,

479
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:39,125
everything else does.

480
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,250
You're a step away from a breakdown.

481
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:43,625
And I get it. I get...

482
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,083
I'm not the one with a mask on.

483
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:52,083
Let's see. Earlier, hmm,
the two of us had a deal.

484
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,041
You were holding the phone,

485
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:56,291
then you changed your mind.

486
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:58,625
What happened?

487
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:03,083
I made you waste your time
while you were questioning me.

488
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:06,625
I pretended you were breaking me
little by little

489
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,333
and that I was about to give in.

490
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:12,000
In the meantime, he slipped
through your fingers. He escaped.

491
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:14,833
It's called diversion tactics,

492
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,416
and it worked well.

493
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,416
You know what I think?

494
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:24,333
Your little shepherd somehow found a way
to make it here in time.

495
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:29,083
I'll find out how.

496
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:31,458
You'll see.

497
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,538
- <i>Think.
- I knew we weren't in Spain.</i>

498
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:51,791
<i>I heard the prayer call from a mosque.</i>

499
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:54,208
<i>Think. You know how.</i>

500
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,208
<i>Fly with me.</i>

501
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:07,666
Shakir.

502
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:09,875
<i>Shakir, do you hear me?</i>

503
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,833
Yes. This is Shakir. Go ahead, Professor.

504
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:15,208
I need you to track
Rio's airplane to Spain.

505
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,875
It's a Beechcraft Air King 250.

506
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,666
<i>Property of the Spanish Air Force.</i>

507
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,333
The flight landed at exactly 4:30 p.m.
on April 4th.

508
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:24,333
<i>Look for that plane
in every navigation satellite.</i>

509
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,625
<i>I need you to find
the exact point of origin.</i>

510
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,458
Does it have battery?

511
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:37,708
- It does.
- And reception?

512
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:42,833
Yes, sir.

513
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,541
Okay. Go to outgoing calls.

514
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:48,333
Miguel, for fuck's sake.
You need to keep a cool head

515
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:51,208
You understand me?
You are never going to be suspicious.

516
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:54,083
- But my fingers are really sweaty.
- Then calm down!

517
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,708
There's one call.
A private number.

518
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:02,833
Go to contacts.

519
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:05,000
There's a number.

520
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,458
Call it.

521
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,625
Oh, God. Please don't answer.

522
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,125
INCOMING CALL

523
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:15,500
It's the phone we gave to Nairobi.

524
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,892
- What are you doing?
- I'm not talking.

525
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:21,791
- Fuck!
- They called and hung up.

526
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:26,208
I'm leaving my fingerprints.
I don't wanna call the police!

527
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,125
Listen.

528
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:29,750
All you have to do
is leave the phone connected.

529
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:33,166
Then you talk to me casual.
A normal conversation between hostages.

530
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,375
When they hear it,
they'll know what to do.

531
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:37,083
You got it?

532
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,125
They're calling again.

533
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,291
<i>Speak.</i>

534
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:47,375
<i>So...</i>

535
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,166
here we are...

536
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:51,625
<i>in the library.</i>

537
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:55,250
<i>All together, and we're just being
watched by one of them.</i>

538
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:57,750
<i>Random guy. I think his name's Matías.</i>

539
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:00,791
- Turn the volume all the way up.
- I think it's Arturo Román.

540
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:02,875
No one's in the hall, right, Miguel?

541
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:04,416
There's nobody.

542
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:09,791
- I can't use my voice, sir.
- Ssh!

543
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:11,875
And now since that guy escaped, Gandía,

544
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:15,000
<i>I think it'd be the perfect time
for the police to come in</i>

545
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,083
<i>because, I repeat,</i>

546
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:18,583
there's no one in the main hall.

547
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:21,958
<i>Thank God we're okay. We're scared.
There was a shooting, a grenade,</i>

548
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,375
screaming, even religious chants.
It's nuts. Right, Miguel?

549
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:27,541
That's right.

550
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:30,375
I'm sorry.

551
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,500
We need to go in. Fuck!

552
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:37,143
The President doesn't want any
armored vans to approach the bank.

553
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:40,458
For fuck's sake! They're not looking.
We'll catch them off guard.

554
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:42,166
I can't do it!

555
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,625
What are you guys doing?

556
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:47,458
It's this kid.
He's lost it. He's really nervous.

557
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:49,208
Poor little guy. He was praying.

558
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:51,666
- I think so. What do I know?
- Come here.

559
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:56,041
Sit over here and be quiet,
nice and close to me.

560
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:58,625
Raise your hands where I can see them.

561
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:03,291
If you lower them an inch, I'll shoot you.
If you move an inch, I'll shoot you.

562
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:06,458
And if you say even one fucking word...

563
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:08,666
- You'll shoot me.
- Yes, I'll shoot you.

564
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,416
- I'm thinking about shooting you anyway.
- Copy.

565
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,041
Ssh. Quiet.

566
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:20,250
Suarez, get an intervention unit ready.
We're going in through the main hall.

567
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:23,041
And Call Gandía in the panic room
so we can coordinate.

568
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:25,875
Fucking finally.
I didn't think you had any balls.

569
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:39,791
<i>Professor.</i>

570
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,458
<i>The Beechcraft Air King 250,</i>

571
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:47,833
the one that flew Rio to Spain,
took off from Algeria at 3:03 p.m...

572
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,708
<i>from a village named Timimoun.
It's located in the Atlas Mountains.</i>

573
00:34:58,916 --> 00:34:59,916
Good.

574
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:02,541
That's minutes before
the car with Rio got there.

575
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,705
It's right by the plane.
I need you to find that car.

576
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:07,309
<i>I can see the whole area is a desert.
There's no trees,</i>

577
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:09,708
so we should be able to trace it
through the satellite

578
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:11,833
- and find where the car came from.
- <i>Okay.</i>

579
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:14,000
We'll start with the weather satellites.

580
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:15,083
Very good.

581
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,708
You're going to Algeria.
In four hours, I want you in Timimoun.

582
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,625
I can't fly with weapons.

583
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,333
I know. Once you get there,
everything will be ready.

584
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:34,958
- The plan was not to leave you alone.
- The plan has just changed, Marseille.

585
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:37,750
I need all the Serbs
and Benjamin's team

586
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:39,333
to go on the offensive.

587
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:41,875
We're gonna hit them so much,
so fast and so hard

588
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:44,208
that they won't even know
where the hits are coming from.

589
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,041
How are you doing?

590
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,000
My stitches...

591
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,166
are coming out.

592
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:15,166
Where is he?

593
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:17,083
I don't know.

594
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:18,958
Where is he?

595
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:23,291
Denver...

596
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,750
I don't know.

597
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:34,916
Here we are, you son of a fucking bitch.

598
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:37,666
And the other one?

599
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:39,791
I'm right here.

600
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,166
Good.
Then I'm gonna start releasing Nairobi.

601
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:52,666
Mutt, would you like to say something
before we begin to dance?

602
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,875
Well? Well...

603
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,708
- Party time?
- Party time.

604
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:15,750
Nairobi.

605
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,500
<i>Hey, sleepyhead!</i>

606
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:20,458
You've gotta be a real badass
to sleep like this

607
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:22,833
while everyone's waiting for you
at the table.

608
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:24,333
You staying in bed all day?

609
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:26,291
- Hm? So sleepy.
- Hey!

610
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,500
What?

611
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:30,791
He said yes.

612
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:35,000
The Professor.

613
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,291
He said yes.

614
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:43,583
- You're going to be an aunt!
- An aunt!

615
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,583
- I'm so happy for you.
- I can't believe it!

616
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:49,375
- Hey...
- What?

617
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:51,017
You'll have a little nerd in the house.

618
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:53,041
<i>Yeah. What are we gonna name it?</i>

619
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
<i>Hmm?</i>

620
00:37:58,125 --> 00:37:59,208
Ibiza.

621
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:03,458
Oh, my God. I love it. Ibiza.

622
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:06,583
<i>- I love it!
- You call the baby Ibiza,</i>

623
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,958
and you're gonna have
so much fucking fun together.

624
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:12,750
Fuck. It's gonna be so popular
in high school.

625
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,208
<i>It's not a city.
It's an island.</i>

626
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:18,416
Fuck it, you know
what other rule we're gonna break?

627
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,916
Not seeing each other again.

628
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,583
You're gonna be an aunt.

629
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:23,958
<i>You know what?</i>

630
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:25,708
You're gonna be a godmother.

631
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:28,000
That's right, baby.

632
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:31,000
I can't wait.

633
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,250
Me neither!

634
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:35,125
Me neither.

635
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,416
I can't believe it.

636
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:43,333
- Mm.
- What? What?

637
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:45,916
- Ibiza, right?
- Yes! I'll tell you one thing.

638
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,916
I'm not spending any more Christmases
alone with Helsinki.

639
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,875
He doesn't know any Christmas carols.

640
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:53,833
From now on,
every Christmas is for family.

641
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:56,208
- What's going on here?
- What are you doing?

642
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:59,875
Single mother bachelorette party.

643
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:02,083
- Whoo!
- Are you pregnant?

644
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:05,500
Yeah! No, no, no, no. After the heist.
I will be after the heist.

645
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,958
- I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
- Me neither.

646
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:08,958
What?

647
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:10,333
A friend with benefits.

648
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:11,625
- Awesome.
- Okay.

649
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:14,458
- Wanna know the baby's name?
- Ibiza!

650
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:29,250
<i>Okay, mutt.</i>

651
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:42,625
I want everyone against the wall.
Lower your guns.

652
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I'd ask you to throw them on the floor,

653
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,750
but I know myself,
and if I saw you unarmed,

654
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,250
I'd get too excited.

655
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:52,916
So we should show a little mutual respect.
Right?

656
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,625
Down.

657
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:58,000
Come on. Yeah.

658
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:00,083
I'm aiming my gun at her head.

659
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,208
I'm wearing a bulletproof vest,
and she's tied up,

660
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:06,583
so I wouldn't try anything crazy
if I were you. Come on. Let's go.

661
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:16,583
Lower your fucking gun, asshole!
Aren't you listening?

662
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:22,125
There.

663
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:24,833
Slowly. Slowly.

664
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:31,708
Shall we dance a little bit?

665
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:33,250
Come on. Let's dance.

666
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:41,000
Darling, you're falling.

667
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,791
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

668
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:45,125
Look at your fatty.

669
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:47,333
Hello, fatty!

670
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:48,416
That's enough.

671
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:50,583
Let her go now.

672
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:52,875
Easy. Easy.

673
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:55,083
Take it easy.

674
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,333
I'll let her go.

675
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:57,875
Hey, don't worry.

676
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,458
I'll let her go.

677
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:00,875
Here we go.

678
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:05,958
Here.

679
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,208
There. See?

680
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:21,833
Hey, mutt.

681
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:32,458
I told you I was gonna kill you.

682
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:36,666
