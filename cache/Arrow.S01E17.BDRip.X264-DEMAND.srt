1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,169
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,449
For five years, I was stranded on an island
with only one goal:

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,611
Survive.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,125
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,561
Now, I will fulfill my father's dying wish:

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,848
to use the list of names he left me...

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,606
...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,164
To do this, I must become someone else.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,563
I must become something else.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,370
Previously on Arrow:

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,010
- Mom?
-It's about Sara.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,606
- What about her?
- I think she may be alive.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,326
I'm not here to hurt you or your father.

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,686
Why should I trust you?

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,606
Because you always have.

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,364
This is my daughter, Helena.

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,724
When her father killed her fiance, she
changed into something dark and twisted.

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,081
I have been alone in my hate for so long.

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,329
- What is this?
- Payback.

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,522
The police have him in custody.
He's going to jail and then to prison.

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,091
I'm not going to stop.

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,681
Hey, mister.

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,125
You feel like a dance?

24
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,761
Absolutely.

25
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,049
Tonight your first night? Hmm?

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,244
First. And last, Gus.

27
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,360
- Helena?
- I'm looking for my father.

28
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,924
I figure if anybody knows where he is,
it would be his attorney.

29
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,366
I don't.

30
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,251
Ow. Whoa!

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,281
Helena, I swear I'd tell you
where the FBI is keeping Frank...

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,922
...but after your father and I
made his plea deal to testify...

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,242
...the feds,
they stopped telling me anything.

34
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,531
Please. You have to believe me.

35
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,806
I do.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,322
Hey, Gus, song's over, man.
You still in there?

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,928
Oh, my gosh.

38
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,366
It looks amazing.

39
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,524
Yeah.

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,444
Steve Aoki's gonna DJ right there.

41
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,571
- What? How did you get Steve Aoki?
- I dated his sister.

42
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,327
- A million years ago. A million years ago.
- Okay.

43
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,048
So will you be my date tomorrow night?

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,163
- Is a club opening a proper date?
- I certainly hope so.

45
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,490
- Is that a yes?
- No.

46
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,841
That's a yes.

47
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,925
Laurel, I'm glad you called.

48
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,327
Two months is too long for us
to go without talking.

49
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,049
- Dad, I have to tell you--
- No, listen.

50
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,686
Before you say anything,
I got to apologize.

51
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,323
I should never have used you
to catch the archer and I'm sorry.

52
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,450
- Laurel, I'm just-- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

53
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,685
- I owe you an apology too.
- For what?

54
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,564
Hello, Quentin.

55
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,484
How are you?

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,011
You look well.

57
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,762
What are you doing here?
Why are you here?

58
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,969
I'm here
because I believe Sara's still alive.

59
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,009
What?

60
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,087
- Dad. Sit.
- What is going on?

61
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,045
Just hear Mom out. Sit.

62
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,242
- What's going on?
- Start from the beginning.

63
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,527
Oliver was found on an island
called Lian Yu in the North China Sea.

64
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,927
There are hundreds,
thousands of deserted islands in this chain.

65
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,610
What if Sara had survived too?

66
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,280
Nobody would know
if she'd washed up in any of those.

67
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,444
So you don't actually have any proof
that she's alive?

68
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,324
I have proof.

69
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,563
A tourist took this.

70
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,683
- Could be anybody.
- Doesn't it look just like Sara?

71
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,883
Our daughter's a survivor, Quentin.

72
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,046
You have some nerve. Three years,
no phone calls, no e-mails, nothing.

73
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,090
- You just show up with an old photo-- No.
- Dad, please.

74
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,528
Please, you listen to me, okay?
Sara died on that boat.

75
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,402
Why are you making me re-live this?

76
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,725
Why you doing this?

77
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,247
- Dad...
- No.

78
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,849
So I told Chris and Shane
they could be our plus ones tonight...

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,049
...to Oliver's club, if they're lucky.

80
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,248
We both have plus ones, right?

81
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,885
Uh...

82
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,441
I don't know. Hold on just a second.

83
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,841
I didn't know purse snatchers
took coffee breaks.

84
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,408
For a stuck-up rich-bitch,
you spend a lot of time here in the Glades.

85
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,005
My job's around here.

86
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,242
- You have a job?
- Yeah.

87
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,640
You should try it.

88
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,561
Instead of hanging out on a street corner
waiting to boost somebody's handbag.

89
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,401
Sounds good. Know anyone hiring
high-school dropouts with a couple priors...

90
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,285
...no references and a history of violence?

91
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,649
Actually, I might.

92
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,841
You know that new club opening
in the Glades? Verdant?

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,923
My brother owns it.

94
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,560
I think they might be hiring
valet attendants.

95
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,327
You think it's a good idea,
me taking the keys to strangers' cars?

96
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,448
I think it's time you put up or shut up.

97
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,571
Talk to your brother.

98
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,651
Yo.

99
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,251
Hey-

100
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,163
- Where you been?
- I thought I'd give myself a rare morning in.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,844
Don't look at me like that.
The club is opening finally.

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,243
McKenna and I are going on date
number six tonight which is...

103
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,521
It's significant. And, uh, I don't know.

104
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,048
It seemed like a good day
to give the bad guys a rest.

105
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,321
Well, it's the bad girls
that I'm worried about.

106
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,922
- Helena.
- Yes, or as I like to call her...

107
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,011
...your psycho ex-girlfriend.
This was taken at Alley Cats, the strip joint.

108
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,209
The police report lists the stifPs name
as Gus Sabatoni.

109
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,807
That's Bertinelli's lawyer.
Why would she come back just for him?

110
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,851
Not like he did a good job. Her father's
serving consecutive life sentences.

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,526
Come on, we both knew
this was just a matter of time.

112
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,041
You tried to help her, you couldn't.

113
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,488
Now the only question is how long
before she drops a dime on you...

114
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,881
...me, this whole operation.

115
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,328
Okay. I want you to get in touch
with our contacts in the Bratva.

116
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,962
Talk to anyone on the street, figure out
where Helena is, why she's back.

117
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,169
- Okay, but Oliver--
- If she's here, she's here for a reason.

118
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,085
If that's not Frank,
need to know what she has planned.

119
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,049
Okay.

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,685
- Speedy?
- Oh, we're in here.

121
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,329
Look who's back.

122
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,280
She was just telling me
about your guys' first date at Russo's.

123
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,646
Hello, Oliver.

124
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,282
Ollie, I kind of have this pseudo friend
that's looking for a job.

125
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,644
- I was wondering if the club's still hiring?
- Yes. Of course. Talk to Tommy.

126
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,088
As a matter of fact, you can go upstairs
and call Tommy right now.

127
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,045
Great. You rock.

128
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,086
Where have you been?

129
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,965
Um...

130
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,408
Barcelona.

131
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,840
Monaco. Budapest.
I just needed to forget who I was.

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,411
And how much I missed you.

133
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,211
Do you mean like you missed
Gus Sabatoni?

134
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,209
I thought you were done
with your father's organization, Helena.

135
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,968
Because he's serving consecutive
life sentences in Iron Heights prison.

136
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,690
You got your revenge.

137
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,161
He just cut a deal
with the Justice Department...

138
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,840
...to testify against the East Coast Family.

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,483
In 48 hours, Witness Protection
will give him a new name, a new life...

140
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,405
...and he'll be off the grid forever,
untraceable.

141
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,085
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

142
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,722
My father doesn't deserve
a second chance, a second life.

143
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,920
And I can't take on a phalanx
of U.S. Marshals.

144
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,085
- Not without help.
- No.

145
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,764
That's murder. It's notjustice.

146
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,490
Oh, there you are.

147
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,843
I have a question
about your opening tonight.

148
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,002
- Hello.
- Hi.

149
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,604
Oliver, who is your friend?

150
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,723
Oh. Mom, this is Helena.

151
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,770
- Helena, this is my mother.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

152
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,410
- Helena was just leaving.
- Yes.

153
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,085
I have a family engagement.

154
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,328
- Excuse us for a minute.
- Of course.

155
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,046
I guess I will just have
to be more persuasive.

156
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,047
Fortunately, you have a family too.

157
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,483
She was in my house.
She made a not-so-veiled threat.

158
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,120
I want extra security
around my mother and sister.

159
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,891
- Way ahead of you, man.
- Thank you.

160
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,805
-It's my job.
- For not saying "I told you so."

161
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,889
Night's yOUnQ-

162
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,725
Where you been?
The club's opens in four hours.

163
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,929
- I've been dealing with the vendors.
- No, you haven't.

164
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,684
Tommy.

165
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,003
We need to talk.

166
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,765
I'm sorry.

167
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,245
But I kept this a secret to protect the people
that are closest to me.

168
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,926
Do you think that's what I care about?

169
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,323
What, that my feelings are hurt?

170
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,563
You're a murderer. A killer.

171
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,282
You were my best friend in life,
but now it's like I don't even know you.

172
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,602
You're right. I've changed.

173
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,767
Listen, buddy, now I can explain to you.

174
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,447
- I can explain to you how and why--
- What'd be the point?

175
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,085
I wouldn't believe a word of it anyway.

176
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,841
One of those missiles has an effective range
of up to 2400 kilometers.

177
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,646
We're not going anywhere
until we figure out what Fyers is planning.

178
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,531
Wild guess? He's planning
on blowing something up.

179
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,488
Well, one of those could do that job.
But this?

180
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,965
This is about starting a war.

181
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,800
- With who?
- What does it matter?

182
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,883
We have to stop Fyers before he kills
thousands of innocent people.

183
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,405
There are a ton of soldiers.

184
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,050
Even if we get through all of them,
we can't just steal a whole missile launcher.

185
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,650
Well, who said anything
about stealing it?

186
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,047
So, what's the plan? Ambush?

187
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,363
Impossible. Can't take out six
without one radioing for backup.

188
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,444
It'd be good
if we could get all the soldiers in one place.

189
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,083
You're right.

190
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,044
What is--? Damn thing.

191
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,206
- What did the stapler ever do to you?
- What is it?

192
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,125
I'm busy. The Hood's girlfriend's back.

193
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,966
Dad, I'm sorry about this morning.

194
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,960
But if I told you the real reason to come
see me, you wouldn't have shown up.

195
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,242
You're damn right I wouldn't.

196
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,043
So you really believe this garbage
about Sara being alive on fantasy island?

197
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,400
I mean, no.

198
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,567
But what would it hurt to take
a look at everything that Mom found?

199
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,563
Even if it's just to set her straight.

200
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,405
You know how long it's taken...

201
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,485
...to get to a place where Sara isn't the first
thing I think about every morning.

202
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,284
Dad.

203
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,246
Tell your mom
I'm not making any promises.

204
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,964
To Verdant.

205
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,011
I know I haven't always been
supportive of this venture...

206
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,165
...but I have to admit this nightclub
is quite an accomplishment.

207
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,124
I'm proud of you.
Your father would be too.

208
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,124
- Thank you.
- Yeah, congratulations, Ollie.

209
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,806
- Your club doesn't totally suck.
- Thanks, Speedy.

210
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,281
Thank you very much, all of you,
for coming.

211
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,009
There you are.

212
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,000
This place is amazing.
I'm so proud of you and Ollie.

213
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,805
Thanks.

214
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,367
Is everything okay?

215
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,329
I'm great.

216
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,202
Well, breakfast was a disaster.

217
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,489
Breakfast with my parents.

218
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,687
Right. That was this morning.

219
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,044
- Sorry.
- Are you sure everything's okay?

220
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,726
Because you seem completely off.

221
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,167
I'm fine. I promise.

222
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,206
- Tommy. Tommy. Did you call Roy yet?
- I left him a message.

223
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:35,681
He starts tomorrow. Which reminds me,
I have to go check in with the office.

224
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,001
Excuse me.

225
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,841
Hey, Tommy. Remember me?

226
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,563
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- Your timing is perfect. I can't dance.

227
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,324
They said it was urgent.

228
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,245
- You okay?
- Yeah.

229
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,482
- We ran out of Cristal. I'll be right back.
- Oh.

230
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,851
Dig?

231
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,525
Let him go.
He has nothing to do with this.

232
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,400
- I told you. Oliver, I warned you.
- Helena, this isn't you.

233
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,683
My father is a mobster and a murderer.

234
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,003
It is not like you haven't killed men
like that before.

235
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,687
And I tried to teach you
to obtain your objective without killing.

236
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,165
By applying leverage.
By exploiting someone's weakness.

237
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,808
There is a whole club full of leverage
above our heads right now.

238
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,520
Please.

239
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,684
Oliver, don't make me do something
that both of us will regret.

240
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,444
Okay. Okay, I-- You win.
I'll help you. Let him go.

241
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,047
Let him go.

242
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,090
- Don't say it.
- Okay.

243
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,245
Then let's talk about Helena.

244
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,969
Oliver, if you didn't have feelings for this girl,
you would have a different solution...

245
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,401
...than letting her extort you
into killing.

246
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,369
What do you want me to do?

247
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,680
- You want me to kill her?
- I think you would have...

248
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,451
...if she looked like me
instead of the T-Mobile girl.

249
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,843
- She's a stone-cold killer, Oliver.
- She's not evil.

250
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,967
She's been lost since her father
killed her fiance in cold blood.

251
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,521
And are you gonna sit there...

252
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,889
...and tell me that you don't know
what it's like to want revenge?

253
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,850
What would you do, hmm?

254
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,002
If Floyd Lawton
was standing right there?

255
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,883
Nothing that would involve
blackmailing you into hunting him down.

256
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,721
You're right. Okay? I can't kill her.

257
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,090
And I can't take her to the police
and risk her exposing all of this.

258
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,687
But at least if I'm involved,
I can contain her, all right?

259
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,922
I can minimize the collateral damage.

260
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,850
Sorry, am I interrupting something?

261
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,367
We were just talking about you.

262
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,527
And here I thought
you didn't care much for me.

263
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,006
Still don't.

264
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,528
I haven't been able to locate
where the FBI is keeping your father.

265
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,889
I can help. I've been dying to hack
into the FBl's security system.

266
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,247
Get out. Get out.

267
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,730
This is a private thing, Felicity. Please.

268
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,282
Oh. Okay.

269
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,727
See you. I guess.

270
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,640
How many girlfriends
do you have exactly?

271
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,770
Like I said, we don't know
where the safe house is.

272
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,089
What we know is that the Marshall
service is taking your father...

273
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,244
...to a hearing
at the Justice Department tonight.

274
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,688
There's a problem, Helena.

275
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,604
There are two vans.

276
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,162
- And one of them's a decoy.
- Well, it's a good thing there's two of us.

277
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,530
-It's not too late to call this off.
- I think you know me better than that.

278
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,284
I don't take prisoners.

279
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,604
Hey!

280
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,046
I found an intruder
while I was circling the perimeter.

281
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,450
It's Wilson.

282
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,281
You killed a few of my friends, son of a bitch.

283
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,044
And I'm gonna kill a few more.

284
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,600
I'll talk to one of our lawyers
and have them call you right back.

285
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,971
Cut yourself shaving?

286
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,281
- Hi.
- Hey.

287
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,845
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

288
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,246
- How was Roy's first day?
- Kid never showed.

289
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,244
Um...

290
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,370
I just, uh-- I came by
to apologize for last night.

291
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,080
Instead of an apology,
why don't you try the truth?

292
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,370
You can start with your wrist.

293
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,811
I got into a fight with a blender at the club.
It was stupid.

294
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,402
I thought I asked for the truth.

295
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,769
I know something's up.
Why won't you tell me what's going on?

296
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,089
- Because I can't.
- Why not?

297
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,091
I can't tell you that either.
I wish that I could.

298
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,521
Laurel, I'm sorry.

299
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,529
So am I.

300
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,404
I really need you right now, Tommy.

301
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,370
My mother shows up
saying my dead sister is still alive...

302
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,729
...and my father is furious with me
that I'm even listening to her.

303
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,766
And I don't know who to believe.
I feel like I'm falling apart.

304
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,605
- Laurel, I'm still here for you.
- No, you're not.

305
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,124
You're a million miles away and the worst
part is, I don't even know why.

306
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,441
I'm sorry.

307
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,641
Wow.

308
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,006
Stalker much?

309
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,329
- You didn't show up for the job.
- Yeah, I had second thoughts...

310
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,927
-...about parking your brother's Bentley.
- Being a valet is beneath you?

311
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,203
No. But accepting charity
from some rich girl is.

312
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,489
Why are you so obsessed with the fact
that I have money?

313
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,642
You know, money isn't everything.

314
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,207
Spoken like someone who's got it.

315
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,445
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to get back to my life of crime.

316
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,881
Yo. Can you help me out? I think I'm lost.

317
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,208
- Where's downtown at?
- I don't know.

318
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,160
Maybe you can give us some directions.
Or, better yet, some money.

319
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,324
You Okay?

320
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,641
You're bleeding!

321
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,683
Yeah, you know, that's what happens
when you get stabbed.

322
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,247
Just your father. Anyone else gets hurt
and I'll put an arrow into you.

323
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,410
That's sweet.

324
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,360
Now I know how you charmed
your cop girlfriend.

325
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,323
Give me Frank Bertinelli!

326
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,083
Your father's not in the van.

327
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,651
But he sends his regards.
Where's the Hood?

328
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,765
Helena Bertinelli...

329
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,246
...you have the right to remain silent.

330
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,000
Damn it.

331
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,168
Anything you say can and will
be held against you in a court of law.

332
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,966
You have the right to an attorney.

333
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,849
Paul Copani. Nick Salvati.
Gus Sabatoni.

334
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,128
You are quite the hunter, Miss Bertinelli.

335
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,001
Well, I guess
I should make that "huntress."

336
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,010
You've been taking down everyone
in your father's criminal organization.

337
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,811
When Gus Sabatoni turned up dead...

338
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,010
...we knew it was just a matter of time
before you tried to murder your old man.

339
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,087
- Do you want to tell us why?
- Not particularly.

340
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,328
You should reconsider.

341
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,725
We got you, but the vigilante got away
before ESU could move on him.

342
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,168
You know who he is. Who he really is.

343
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,288
Don't you?

344
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,007
Ms. Bertinelli, you're going away for all day.
We can't change that.

345
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,530
But things can be better.

346
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,201
Or they could be worse.

347
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,844
You tell me his name,
I will do everything I can to make it better.

348
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,841
Oliver Queen.

349
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,764
You're dating him now, right?

350
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,280
I saw you at the opening of his club
last night.

351
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,683
Did he mention
that we used to be lovers?

352
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,003
We want to know about the Hood,
not Oliver Queen.

353
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,686
Let me let you in on a little secret.

354
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,209
It's not gonna work out between you two.
You see, Oliver has a particular talent.

355
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,085
He uses people.

356
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,245
He used me.
He used the detective here's daughter.

357
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,801
Excuse me, daughters.

358
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,806
I would get out of it
before you get yourself hurt.

359
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,964
Last chance.

360
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,041
His name.

361
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,124
"The Hood."

362
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,731
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

363
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,370
Let's go.

364
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,047
- Get out of here.
- Can't see anything.

365
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,450
Freeze!

366
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,642
Sounds like quite the daring rescue.

367
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,371
You're very lucky to have a friend
like Roy, Thea.

368
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,286
- Oh, don't I know it.
- We're not friends.

369
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,088
Well, let me get you stitched up...

370
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,689
...and then you two can decide
what you are or aren't.

371
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,081
You are such a jerk.

372
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,410
Roy, what's the matter?

373
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,688
Nothing.
I just don't see why I need a shot.

374
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,208
Oh, don't tell me a tough gangbanger like
yourself is afraid of a tiny little needle.

375
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:37,002
- It doesn't look so tiny.
- Well, just think about something else.

376
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,447
- Besides the needle.
- Like what?

377
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,807
Okay, now this could sting a little.

378
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,365
Done.

379
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,688
Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?

380
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,849
Thanks for the save.

381
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,561
- I couldn't risk you telling police about me.
- Is that the only reason?

382
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,124
Why can't you just admit
that you still have feelings for me too?

383
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,246
- What is it?
- A plane ticket to Rome and a passport...

384
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,644
...so you can start a new life
somewhere else.

385
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,001
The police know
you're tracking your father, Helena.

386
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,481
You'll never find him.

387
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,326
So get out of my city.

388
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,444
Place these around the launcher.

389
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,210
Do it quickly.
Their backup will be arriving any second.

390
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,284
We are 60 seconds out from the launcher.

391
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,171
Set your final charges and we'll blow it.

392
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,367
I think I have a better idea.

393
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,480
What are you doing?

394
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,929
I'm taking the circuit board. Computers
won't work without them. Neither will this.

395
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,922
Leverage.

396
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,603
- I'm sorry. I should've called.
- No, it's okay.

397
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,000
Come on in.

398
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,440
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

399
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,206
- Thank you.
- I'm surprised, but I'm happy.

400
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,771
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

401
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,329
- Everything okay?
- I had a really rough night.

402
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,007
I just wasn't anticipating,
with my work and the club...

403
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,050
...I feel like I'm letting everybody down.

404
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,650
My family and Tommy and you.

405
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,802
I feel like I'm letting you down.

406
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,964
You're being too hard on yourself.
We both have demanding jobs.

407
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,805
That's no excuse for hurting
the people closest to you.

408
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,205
No, but when you believe in what you do,
you find a way to make it work.

409
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,566
How?

410
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,322
Well, the first thing you do
is you find yourself someone...

411
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,643
...you never have to apologize to.

412
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,642
Hey, I was multitasking
and intercepted a police report.

413
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:41,250
A local sporting goods store just got
robbed of one high-powered crossbow.

414
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,411
Now, could be a crazy coincidence
or your psycho ex-girlfriend--

415
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,050
Dig's words, not mine.

416
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,202
--Is still in town.

417
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:58,007
I'll let you know if I learn anything more.
In the meantime, just watch your back.

418
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,806
Hi. I don't think we had a chance
to be properly introduced this morning.

419
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,165
- Felicity?
- Oliver. Oliver.

420
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,530
I'm here.

421
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,166
Are you okay?

422
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,641
Hey. He)'-

423
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,086
You Okay?

424
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,410
Got your call.

425
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,323
- What happened?
- Helena.

426
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,643
She wanted the address of the safe house
where her father's kept.

427
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,246
She made me hack the FBI database.

428
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,847
- I'm sorry, Oliver.
- Hey, it's not your fault.

429
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,330
- Oliver, what are you gonna do?
- What I should've done in the first place.

430
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,125
Helena!

431
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,003
Code three,
shots fired at the Bertinelli safe house.

432
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,043
This is Hall. I'm on-site.

433
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,369
Wait for backup, detective. That's an order.

434
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,045
You won't shoot me.

435
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,206
- You're not a murderer, remember?
- But you are.

436
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,209
And if I let you go,
that blood will be on my hands.

437
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,044
I'm sorry.

438
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,287
I practiced that move.

439
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,408
I had a feeling I might need it someday.

440
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,641
You would have killed me.

441
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,884
Enough!

442
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,565
Freeze!

443
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,288
Put it down. Turn around.

444
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,482
Slowly.

445
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,490
No!

446
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,448
McKenna.

447
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,483
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

448
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,727
How you feeling?

449
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,287
Ah, numb.

450
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,403
- Hey, don't move.
- Okay. Okay.

451
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,281
I met your doctor. He's a nice guy.

452
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,490
- He says you're lucky to be alive.
- Yeah.

453
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,923
He also said I have a shattered femur...

454
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,971
...and it's gonna take at least a year
to rehab.

455
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,368
- I loved being a cop.
- Oh, come on. McKenna.

456
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,522
You're still a cop.
You have one more surgery, go home--

457
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,364
- I'm not going home.
- What?

458
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,368
Moving to Coast City
to live with my sister.

459
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,684
They have the best physical therapy facility
in the country there.

460
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,760
I'll visit.

461
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,046
- I told you, I'm a billionaire, right?
- Yeah.

462
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,406
I'll move to Coast City.

463
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,805
That's very sweet,
but your club just opened.

464
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,727
- And your work is here.
- Don't worry about me.

465
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,524
-It's my responsibility to worry about you.
- Just stop, okay?

466
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,081
Listen, you know how I feel about you.

467
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,367
Please don't make this harder
than it already is.

468
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,281
Okay.

469
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,206
Okay. It's, uh...

470
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,368
It's whatever you need.

471
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,642
- Cleaning out your desk?
- No. A friend's.

472
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,245
Um...

473
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,124
You asked to see me?

474
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,523
Take a seat.

475
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,205
I'm ready to listen now.

476
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,324
Thank you.

477
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,166
Hey.

478
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,250
I, uh, heard about McKenna. You okay?

479
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,482
Not really.

480
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,484
Look, I know
that I have been a jerk lately.

481
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,643
I just couldn't understand how you could
keep such a huge secret from me.

482
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,169
But I never considered the toll
it must take on you.

483
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,411
Lying to the people
that are closest to me.

484
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,001
It's the hardest part.

485
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,805
I get that.

486
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,720
I was wrong
to think that I could have it both ways...

487
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,565
...that I can do what I do...

488
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,770
...and still have a normal life.

489
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,810
- With anyone.
- Except if you're alone...

490
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,849
...you're never gonna be happy.

491
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,044
Maybe not.

492
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,406
But me being happy
isn't what's important right now.

493
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,091
Your plan. Your call.

494
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,243
Fye rs.

495
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,841
Mr. Queen, I thought
I might be hearing from you.

496
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,650
We have the circuit board.

497
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,763
You are making a grave mistake.

498
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,208
My men are scouring the island for you
as we speak.

499
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,807
And when they find you,
they will kill you.

500
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,610
Very slowly, I'm afraid.

501
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,451
If your men kill us,
you'll never find the circuit board.

502
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,130
After that, we both know all you'll be left with
is a really ugly piece of modern art.

503
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,446
Then what do you propose?

504
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,011
- A trade.
- I see.

505
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,686
And what do you want in exchange?

506
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,002
I want a way off the island.
