Your sister knew perfectly well
we were to leave today.

- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.

She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.

She always comes back with scrapes

My eyes shouted the truth.

- l was so. l watched, but you...

Watching is not seeing, dead girl.

The seeing, the true seeing,

26
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,649

Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.

00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:07,331
And why is it that Lord Eddard

- Mind your place, dancing master.

32

- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.

And l don't have to go

Not so much, my lord.

to die of thirst in these cells.

to have escaped the castle.

- Still engaged to Joffrey.

about Joffrey's birth?

that killed Robert, nor the boar.

The wine slowed him down
and the boar ripped him open,

that killed the king.

[Snims] What smell?

108
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,734
There is none.

109

lf they'd been dead for a long time,
wouldn't there be rot?

- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, my lord.

111
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,870
Fire will do for them.

to examine them first.

Lord Stark has been

125

charged with treason.

126
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:26,163
They say he conspired
with Robert's brothers

127
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:29,208
to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.

[Varys] Your father has proved to be
an amul traitor, dear.

134
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:07,079
King Robert's body was still warm

135

when Lord Eddard began plotting
to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

136

He wouldn't do that.

137
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,672
He knows how much
l love Joffrey. He wouldn't.

138

Please, Your Grace,
there's been a mistake.

139

Send for my father. He'll tell you -
the king was his friend.

Sansa sweetling, you are innocent
of any wrong. We know that.

Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.

[Pycelle] A child born of a traitor's seed

She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace,

146
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:44,908
but in 10 years who knows
what treasons she may hatch?

147

No, l'm not. l'll be
a good wife to him, you'll see.

The girl is innocent, Your Grace.

- Robb.

Word of your father's arrest
will reach him soon, no doubt.

Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father,

156

urge your brother
to keep the king's peace.

157
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,784
Tell him to come to King's Landing
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

Shh.

452
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,366
- Open your ears.
- [Leaves rustling]

453
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:26,788
lt's only the wind.

454
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:30,584
Who do you think
sends the wind if not the gods?

455
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,504
They see you, boy.

456
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:37,090
They hear you. [Sighs]

457
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:40,469
Your brother will get
no help from them where he's going.

458
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:43,180
The old gods have
no power in the South.

459
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:47,017
The weirwoods there were all
cut down a long time ago.

460
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:49,645
How can they watch
when they have no eyes?

461
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:52,064
[Running footsteps]

462
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:56,610
[Osha giggles]
Well, there's a big man.

463
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:59,863
He has giants' blood
in him or l'm the queen.

464
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:03,075
- Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
- [Laughs]

465
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:05,577
- Go dress.
- Hodor.

466
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:10,874
Are there really giants beyond the wall?

467
00:38:12,543 --> 00:38:15,420
Giants and worse than giants.

468
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:20,217
l tried telling your brother,
he's marching the wrong way.

469
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,679
All these swords,
they should be going north, boy.

470
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:25,806
North, not south!

471
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:32,521
- The cold winds are rising.
- [Leaves rustling]

472
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:50,873
They were touched by white walkers.

473
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:53,208
That's why they came back.

474
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,669
That's why their eyes turned blue.

475
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,839
Only fire will stop them.

476
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:04,428
- How do you know that?
- l read about it in a book...

477
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:07,514
a very old book
in Maester Aemon's library.

478
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,062
- What else did the book say?
- The white walkers

479
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:17,524
sleep beneath the ice
for thousands of years.

480
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:19,484
And when they wake up...

481
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:24,281
And when they wake up, what?

482
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:29,703
l hope the Wall's high enough.

483
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:54,728
[Men chattering in camp]

484
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:04,905
Summer snows, my lady.

485
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:07,658
Robb's brought the North with him.

486
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:17,626
The river lords are falling back
with Jaime Lannister at their heels.

487
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:21,171
And Lord Tywin is bringing around
a second Lannister army from the South.

488
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:23,841
Our scouts confirm
it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.

489
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:27,094
One army or two,
the kings in the North

490
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:30,931
threw back hosts 10 times as large.

491
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:36,103
Mother!

492
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:43,151
You look well.

493
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:47,281
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight
in these troubled times.

494
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:50,325
We had thought not
to meet you here, my lady.

495
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,744
l had not thought to be here.

496
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:55,205
l would speak with my son alone.

497
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,583
l know you will forgive me, my lords.

498
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,877
You heard her!
Move your arses!

499
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:02,254
Come on, out.

500
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:05,299
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?

501
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,009
Have no fear, my lady.

502
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,720
We'll shove our swords
up Tywin Lannister's bunghole

503
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:12,556
and then it's on
to the Red Keep to free Ned.

504
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:15,350
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.

505
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:17,686
You're not wasting away, are you?

506
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:32,201
l remember the day
you came into this world,

507
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:34,828
red-faced and squalling.

508
00:41:36,371 --> 00:41:39,041
And now l find you leading a host to war.

509
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:42,961
- There was no one else.
- No one?

510
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,130
Who were those men l saw here?

511
00:41:45,214 --> 00:41:49,301
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.

512
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,553
lf you think you can
send me back to Winterfell...

513
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,014
Oh, would that l could.

514
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:59,311
There was...

515
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:01,438
a letter.

516
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:06,068
From Sansa.

517
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:08,362
From the queen, you mean.

518
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:19,540
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.

519
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:32,970
How many men do you have?

520
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:35,013
18,OOO.

521
00:42:35,097 --> 00:42:37,391
lf l go to King's Landing
and bend my knee to Joffrey...

522
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:40,435
You would never
be allowed to leave. No.

523
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:44,231
Our best hope,
our only hope,

524
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:48,735
- is that you can defeat them in the field.
- And if l lose?

525
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:51,321
Do you know what happened
to the Targaryen children

526
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:54,616
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.

527
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:57,119
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.

528
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,746
And the years have not made him kinder.

529
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,252
lf you lose,

530
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:09,339
your father dies, your sisters die,

531
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:11,508
we die.

532
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:17,014
Well, that makes it simple, then.

533
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:19,474
l suppose it does.

534
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:46,210
From here it might be best
if Bronn and l continue alone.

535
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:48,629
Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin.

536
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:50,506
Not best for me.

537
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,675
lf the halfman betrays us,

538
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,554
Shagga, son of Dolf,
will cut off his manhood...

539
00:43:57,638 --> 00:44:00,432
And feed it to the goats, yes.

540
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:04,811
All right, then.

541
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:06,980
Time to meet my father.

542
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,015
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.

543
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:44,017
Father.

544
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:48,605
The rumours of your demise
were unfounded.

545
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:52,067
Sorry to disappoint you.

546
00:44:52,818 --> 00:44:54,444
And who are these...

547
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:56,655
companions of yours?

548
00:44:58,657 --> 00:45:01,743
This is Shagga, son of Dolf,

549
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:03,871
chieftain of the Stone Crows.

550
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:08,375
Timett, son of Timett
ruler of the Burned Me!n.

551
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:13,297
This fair maid is Chella,
daughter of Cheyk,

552
00:45:13,422 --> 00:45:15,340
leader of the Black Ears.

553
00:45:15,424 --> 00:45:17,843
And here we have Bronn, son of...

554
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,055
You wouldn't know him.

555
00:45:23,557 --> 00:45:26,018
May l present my lord father,

556
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,770
Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister,

557
00:45:28,854 --> 00:45:32,107
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West?

558
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:36,278
Kind of you to go to war for me.

559
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:41,158
You left us no choice.

560
00:45:41,283 --> 00:45:43,577
The honour of the house was at stake.

561
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:48,040
Your brother would never have
submitted to capture so meekly.

562
00:45:48,165 --> 00:45:50,584
We have our differences, Jaime and l.

563
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:52,794
He's braver. l'm better-looking.

564
00:45:52,878 --> 00:45:55,464
He's been covering himself in glory.

565
00:45:55,506 --> 00:45:58,300
Jaime smashed the river lords
at the Golden Tooth,

566
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:02,304
and now lays siege to Riverrun,
Catelyn Stark's homeland.

567
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:05,349
- And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.

568
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:08,435
He will lead no armies
from his dungeon cell.

569
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:12,439
How did my sweet sister persuade the king
to imprison his dear friend Ned?

570
00:46:12,564 --> 00:46:17,319
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

571
00:46:19,738 --> 00:46:22,032
My sister rules, you mean.

572
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:24,284
Stark's son has called his banners.

573
00:46:24,743 --> 00:46:28,705
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.

574
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:32,626
One taste of battle and he'll run back
to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.

575
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:38,423
Maybe. Though the boy does have
a certain belligerence.

576
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:40,175
You'd like him.

577
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:45,222
While we're on the subject of war,

578
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:47,391
l made promises to my friends here,

579
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:49,852
and a Lannister always pays his debts.

580
00:46:49,977 --> 00:46:52,855
We shall require
3,OOO helms and shields,

581
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,065
plus swords, pikes,

582
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,025
gorgets, maces...

583
00:46:57,943 --> 00:47:00,404
lf it please my lord,
Ser Addam bids me report

584
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:02,990
that the northmen
have crossed the Neck.

585
00:47:05,117 --> 00:47:08,745
The wolf rushes
into the lion's jaws. So be it.

586
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:12,040
Kevan, command
the drummers beat assembly.

587
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:16,503
And send word to Jaime
that l am moving against Robb Stark.

588
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:18,505
At once, my lord.

589
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:34,313
lt is said that the men
of the mountain clans are great warriors.

590
00:47:34,438 --> 00:47:36,190
Ride with me against my enemies

591
00:47:36,315 --> 00:47:39,109
and you shall have
all my son promised you and more.

592
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:41,570
Only if the halfman fights with us.

593
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:44,323
Until we hold the steel he pledged us,

594
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:47,868
the little lion's life is ours.

595
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:56,168
[Rodrik] The scouts report
Lord Tywin moves north.

596
00:47:56,293 --> 00:47:59,213
We need to get him on broken ground,
put his knights at a disadvantage.

597
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:04,301
No, we need to get around him and break
Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.

598
00:48:04,426 --> 00:48:07,221
Do that and the river lords will join us.

599
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:10,933
To do either we need to cross the river
and the only crossing is at the Twins.

600
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:14,436
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.

601
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:17,814
''The late Lord Frey'' my father calls him.

602
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:21,693
At the Trident, he didn't appear
until the battle was done.

603
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:25,739
Some men take their oaths
more seriously than others.

604
00:48:27,366 --> 00:48:29,826
[Grunting]

605
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:35,457
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.

606
00:48:35,582 --> 00:48:37,668
So what's it going to be?

607
00:48:37,793 --> 00:48:41,505
Do we move against
Jaime or Lord Tywin?

608
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:49,388
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.

609
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:54,601
Don't worry, lad. He won't be
Ieaving this tent with his head.

610
00:48:56,103 --> 00:48:59,898
- Where did you find him?
- In the brush above the encampment.

611
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,150
He looked to be counting.

612
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:13,954
How high did you get?

613
00:49:16,415 --> 00:49:19,168
20,OOO. Maybe more.

614
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:22,754
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...

615
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:26,842
My father understands mercy,
when there is room for it.

616
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:31,471
And he understands honour...

617
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:35,100
and courage.

618
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:39,354
Let him go.

619
00:49:39,938 --> 00:49:42,149
Robb.

620
00:49:54,286 --> 00:49:57,664
Tell Lord Tywin
winter is coming for him.

621
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:02,169
20,000 northerners marching south
to find out if he really does shit gold.

622
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:06,548
Yes, my lord.

623
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:08,675
Thank you, my lord.

624
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:20,938
Are you touched, boy?!
Letting him go?

625
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:22,689
You call me boy again.

626
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:25,901
Go on.

627
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:37,329
[Growls]

628
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,462
Oi.

629
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:54,263
[Pycelle] It is also the wish of His Grace

630
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:58,308
that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,

631
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:02,229
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.

632
00:51:02,312 --> 00:51:06,942
..be at once raised to the rank of lord...

633
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:08,360
Lord Gyles.

634
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:11,780
..and granted
the ancient seat of Harrenhal,

635
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:15,450
and that his sons and grandsons
shall hold this honour

636
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:20,455
after him until the end of time.

637
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:22,958
[Lords mutter]

638
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:28,005
ln the place of the traitor Eddard Stark,

639
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:32,426
it is the wish of His Grace
that Tywin Lannister,

640
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:36,972
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West,

641
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:40,350
be appointed Hand of the King.

642
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:42,352
Lastly,

643
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:45,272
in these times of treason and turmoil,

644
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:48,400
it is the view of council

645
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:51,570
that the life and safety

646
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:53,614
of King Joffrey

647
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:57,868
be of paramount importance.

648
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:02,039
Ser Barristan Selmy.

649
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:11,924
Your Grace,
l am yours to command.

650
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:14,009
Rise, Ser Barristan.

651
00:52:14,885 --> 00:52:16,970
You may remove your helm.

652
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:24,645
You have served the realm
Iong and faithfully.

653
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:28,524
Every man and woman
in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.

654
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:31,944
But it is time to put aside
your armour and your sword.

655
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:34,821
lt is time to rest
and look back with pride

656
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:37,824
- on your many years of service.
- [Murmuring]

657
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:41,245
Your Grace, the Kingsguard
is a sworn brotherhood.

658
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:45,874
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.

659
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:49,795
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your king's?

660
00:52:50,629 --> 00:52:52,548
[Joffrey] You let my father die.

661
00:52:52,631 --> 00:52:55,509
You're too old to protect anybody.

662
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:00,514
- Your Grace...
- The council has determined

663
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:03,058
that Ser Jaime Lannister
will take your place

664
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:06,895
- as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
- The man who profaned his blade

665
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,064
with the blood of the king
he had sworn to defend!

666
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:11,066
Careful, ser.

667
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:15,279
We have nothing but gratitude
for your long service, good ser.

668
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:17,906
You shall be given
a stout keep beside the sea,

669
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:20,742
with servants
to look after your every need.

670
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:24,830
A hall to die in
and men to bury me.

671
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:29,459
l am a knight.

672
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:32,588
l shall die a knight.

673
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:40,637
A naked knight, apparently.

674
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:42,723
[Laughter]

675
00:53:51,857 --> 00:53:55,694
Even now l could cut through
the five of you like carving a cake!

676
00:53:59,698 --> 00:54:01,950
Here, boy!

677
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:04,703
Melt it down and add it to the others.

678
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:20,886
[Doors creak, clang]

679
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:23,263
lf any man in this hall
has other matters

680
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:27,059
to set before His Grace,
Iet him speak now

681
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:29,686
or go forth and hold his silence.

682
00:54:32,898 --> 00:54:34,650
Your Grace.

683
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:37,819
Come forward, my lady.

684
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:41,698
[Steward] The Lady Sansa
of House Stark.

685
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:46,370
Do you have some business
for the king and the council, Sansa?

686
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:48,413
l do.

687
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:56,755
As it please Your Grace,
l ask mercy for my father,

688
00:54:56,839 --> 00:54:59,424
Lord Eddard Stark,
who was Hand of the King.

689
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:02,719
Treason is a noxious weed.

690
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:06,849
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.

691
00:55:06,932 --> 00:55:09,685
l want to hear what she says.

692
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:11,728
Thank you, Your Grace.

693
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:14,356
Do you deny your father's crime?

694
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:18,235
No, my lords.
l know he must be punished.

695
00:55:19,236 --> 00:55:20,988
All l ask is mercy.

696
00:55:21,488 --> 00:55:23,782
l know my lord father
must regret what he did.

697
00:55:23,907 --> 00:55:25,909
He was King Robert's friend
and he loved him.

698
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:27,703
You all know he loved him.

699
00:55:28,453 --> 00:55:32,499
He never wanted to be Hand
until the king asked him.

700
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:36,378
They must have lied to him -
Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.

701
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:38,338
They must have lied!

702
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:40,883
He said l wasn't the king.

703
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:45,179
- Why did he say that?
- He was badly hurt.

704
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:48,265
Maester Pycelle
was giving him milk of the poppy.

705
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:52,186
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.

706
00:55:54,188 --> 00:55:56,231
A child's faith.

707
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:58,650
Such sweet innocence.

708
00:55:59,276 --> 00:56:03,530
And yet they say wisdom
oft comes from the mouths of babes.

709
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:08,160
Treason is treason!

710
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:13,498
Anything else?

711
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:18,837
lf you still have any amection
in your heart for me,

712
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:22,049
please do me this kindness, Your Grace.

713
00:56:31,725 --> 00:56:33,852
Your sweet words have moved me.

714
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:38,899
But your father has to confess.

715
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:42,444
He has to confess
and say that l'm the king...

716
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,449
or there'll be no mercy for him.

717
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,122
He will.

718
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:60,122
BURN ALL THE WITCHES AND THAT ASSHOLE; JOFFREY!!!
