1
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,902
I'm just hot.

2
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,902
You can speak Chinese?

3
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:27,202
-I learned on my own from a book.
-Oh, great!

4
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:34,202
-My Chinese is not as good as your English.
- Oh, no.

5
00:53:27,853 --> 00:53:29,694
One ticket.

6
01:12:57,562 --> 01:13:03,403
-I didn't do well on the test.
-You worry a lot.

7
01:31:40,604 --> 01:31:44,113
What do you two think you're doing?

8
01:31:48,604 --> 01:31:50,483
We're not doing anything wrong!

9
01:31:50,484 --> 01:31:53,737
Is that what you think?
You're a disgrace to our family.

10
01:31:53,738 --> 01:31:57,199
I'm here for a math test.
What's that got to do with our family?

11
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,099
What's that got to do with our family?

12
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:00,999
You're not doing enough.

13
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,733
Not enough?
Uncle, I'm always studying.

14
01:32:03,734 --> 01:32:06,674
What else you want from me?
Besides, I've proved my skills

15
01:32:06,675 --> 01:32:09,059
Not enough. You didn't do enough.

16
01:32:09,305 --> 01:32:12,037
What have you proved?
Your skill with boys or in math?

17
01:32:12,038 --> 01:32:15,046
Are you here to make out
or to compete?

18
01:32:15,292 --> 01:32:18,509
We have replacements in the team,
you know that.

19
01:32:19,938 --> 01:32:22,045
Child, you've been a disappointment to me.

20
01:32:22,046 --> 01:32:24,570
If I'm not really good enough

21
01:32:24,571 --> 01:32:27,929
and I'm just here because I'm your niece,
then I'd better just go.

22
01:32:27,930 --> 01:32:30,313
Don't you dare!

23
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:33,463
You can't walk away.

24
01:32:37,355 --> 01:32:39,738
Sorry.

25
01:33:07,053 --> 01:33:10,269
Don't ask me to do
what I don't want to do.
