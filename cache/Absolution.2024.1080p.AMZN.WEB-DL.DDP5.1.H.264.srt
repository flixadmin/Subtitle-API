1
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,266
<i>I was, uh,</i>
<i>I was about nine or ten.</i>

2
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:17,071
<i>My old man made me...</i>

3
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,607
<i>fight this older kid</i>
<i>in the neighborhood.</i>

4
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,442
<i>He said I was a pussy.</i>

5
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,714
<i>And if I didn't want</i>
<i>to be a pussy my whole life,</i>

6
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:29,784
<i>I needed to</i>
<i>kick this kid's ass.</i>

7
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:35,590
<i>So...</i>

8
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,592
<i>I beat the kid up.</i>

9
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:43,631
<i>Beat him to a pulp.</i>

10
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,156
<i>He told me I might not</i>
<i>be a pussy, after all.</i>

11
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:58,405
Got some product coming in

12
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:01,743
from New York
the next few days.

13
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:04,244
Need a nice white face
to pick it up and deliver it

14
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,446
-when the time comes.
-What kind of product?

15
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,520
Okay.

16
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:13,588
Look, I need to know

17
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,288
what the fuck
we're bringing up.

18
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,860
No, you ain't fixing
to ask me specifics

19
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:21,095
about my product,
are you, <i>ese?</i>

20
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:24,732
Didn't mean to offend you.

21
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:26,567
No, no, don't tell me
what you meant.

22
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:28,435
I fucking heard your ass.

23
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,608
Okay. Okay.

24
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:35,576
I'm sorry.

25
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,080
Now, don't come
in here acting like

26
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:41,381
you've got some fucking
weight behind your ass.

27
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:42,717
You know the fucking drill.

28
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,819
You either take
the fucking job or you're not.

29
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,490
How's that number?

30
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,460
Looks about right.

31
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:54,929
One of these days
the FBI...

32
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,309
The fuck did you
get that relic?

33
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:13,014
I inherited him
from my old man.

34
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,082
A fucking throwback,
right there.

35
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,351
Does it talk?

36
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,122
This dude was the real
deal back in the day, man.

37
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,024
Was ain't is, homes.

38
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:26,326
Homie past his sell-by date.

39
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:31,065
Somebody tell this fuckpig

40
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,835
that if he don't stop
staring at me,

41
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:35,803
I'm gonna have
to break his shoulders.

42
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:37,805
In the present tense.

43
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,644
Oh, whoa, whoa.

44
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:44,846
Take it easy, man.

45
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:47,982
That motherfucker
still got some game, huh.

46
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,685
I like him.

47
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:53,321
So we got a deal or what?

48
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:56,657
Deal.

49
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:06,734
Dude, you really need to
not be saying shit like that.

50
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:08,336
Do you know
who those guys are?

51
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,872
Somebody
had to say something.

52
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:13,241
Never seen anyone
backpedal so fast.

53
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,977
Hey!
Who's the fucking boss here?

54
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:20,982
You want
to be a boss one day,

55
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:23,017
you got to start
acting like one.

56
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,872
You really need that
to find your way home?

57
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:47,708
No, but my nav system

58
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:49,744
has real-time
traffic pattern algorithms.

59
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:57,018
Oh, you can't smoke in here.

60
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,624
Algorithms... Algorithms...

61
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:08,229
That blow's gonna kill you,
you know that?

62
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,566
You think I'm a tool,
don't ya?

63
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:17,305
No, kid.
I don't think you're a tool.

64
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,073
You're just green is all.

65
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,293
There he is.

66
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:46,167
So, the kid bargained
a good price?

67
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:51,772
Uh, he got an okay price.

68
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,676
So, he shit the bed?

69
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,447
I would have been
scared too at his age, boss.

70
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,983
You know, when he managed
to get his degree from BC,

71
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:04,051
I wanted him
to go to law school.

72
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:05,419
He had other ideas.

73
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:07,655
He wants to be a tough guy,
like you.

74
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:12,026
You know, he set this
whole deal up himself.

75
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,762
He's trying to prove to
everybody he's a shot-caller.

76
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:18,599
What do you think?

77
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:20,434
That ain't
none of my business.

78
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:21,535
I'm not sure he's ever

79
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:22,837
gonna be ready, you know?

80
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,840
He's just not cut out for it,
like you and me.

81
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,476
He just needs some time,
Mister...

82
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:35,850
You forget
my fucking name again?

83
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:39,220
You forget my fucking name?

84
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:42,990
I...

85
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:45,026
I've been having
some trouble sleeping,

86
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,660
I get these headaches.

87
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:48,662
All right.

88
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:51,032
Just make sure the kid
doesn't fuck this one up.

89
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,354
Hey, there he is.

90
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:16,824
Like clockwork.

91
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,692
You late with your rent again?

92
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:20,861
You got anything or not?

93
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:23,431
I've got a hot kid that
could use some sparring.

94
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:29,036
I don't fucking need that.

95
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,268
You okay?

96
00:10:37,606 --> 00:10:39,541
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

97
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:45,980
What'd you think
of the mick?

98
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:48,883
Yeah, he... He can punch,

99
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,217
he's got some juice.

100
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,119
Bit mouthy.

101
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,725
Ain't you
forgetting something?

102
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,498
Oh.

103
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:16,210
Hey.

104
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:18,946
Tilda says only single shots

105
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,848
and to cut you off
at three drinks.

106
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,284
I don't see Tilda.
Do you?

107
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:51,245
You can't touch
a lady like that!

108
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,514
Crazy bitch!

109
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:54,215
Who you fucking
calling a crazy bitch?

110
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:55,282
You can't talk to

111
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,884
a motherfucking lady
like that!

112
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,919
-What did I tell you...
-I don't give a fuck...

113
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:02,289
-You'll put me in a bad mood.
-Fuck you. I will kill you!

114
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,758
-I will fuck you up, bitch!
-You're gonna fuck me?

115
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:05,859
Yeah, bitch-ass.

116
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:06,927
Are you out of your mind?

117
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:08,028
-No.
-Fuck, you bit me!

118
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:09,096
Hey!

119
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,264
You know what happens

120
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,432
-when I get in a bad mood.
-Or what?

121
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:12,733
You want me to put
my fucking hands on you?

122
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:13,867
Fuck you.

123
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,169
Come on, pal.
Take it outside.

124
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:17,338
What'd you say to me?

125
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,074
I said take it outside.

126
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,843
Get the fuck out of here.
Go back to your drink...

127
00:12:26,814 --> 00:12:28,349
Hey, you killed him!

128
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,552
He ain't dead.

129
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:32,587
He's just stupid.

130
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,127
Hey!

131
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:41,228
Hey, asshole!

132
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:43,598
Look, lady,
I don't want no trouble.

133
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:46,433
You knock out my boyfriend
and you don't want no trouble?

134
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:47,569
He had it coming.

135
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:51,438
Okay.

136
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:52,973
Maybe he had it coming.

137
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,111
Who's gonna walk me home?

138
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,419
Easy, babe, easy!

139
00:13:05,553 --> 00:13:07,021
Easy...

140
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,592
No need to be so rough.

141
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:13,160
We'll get there soon enough.

142
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:15,429
Promise.

143
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,335
Ah. Easy!

144
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,573
Easy.

145
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,613
Easy.

146
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,685
Easy.

147
00:13:41,623 --> 00:13:42,691
Easy.

148
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:51,398
How do you get
any sleep living here?

149
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:54,669
I like the noise.

150
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:57,037
I mean, that drunk guy,
he screams, like, every night,

151
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,541
so it's like music to me.

152
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:02,309
I hate silence.

153
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:04,378
I gathered that
back at the bar.

154
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:08,415
Like, this silence
reminds me of home.

155
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,819
Hmm. Where's that?

156
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:12,419
Hmm...

157
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:15,657
Wellesley.

158
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,125
Wellesley? Really?

159
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,493
The good part.

160
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,062
Big house on Cliff Road.

161
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:26,166
And I was a good girl, too.

162
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,868
Yeah?

163
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,537
What the hell
happened to you?

164
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:31,071
Oof...

165
00:14:32,774 --> 00:14:34,743
God save the soul!

166
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,978
Yo, Larry, shut
the fuck up! I've got company.

167
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:40,682
Congratulations,
have a nice evening!

168
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:48,288
See, you couldn't do that
in Wellesley.

169
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,924
I guess not.

170
00:14:52,694 --> 00:14:53,695
Hmm...

171
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,301
Get out.

172
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:02,403
What?

173
00:15:02,537 --> 00:15:03,470
Lupe?

174
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:04,739
Yeah?

175
00:15:04,873 --> 00:15:06,039
That's my name.

176
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:08,108
You're kidding me.

177
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,778
Well, I mean,
it's not my real name,

178
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,911
it's my nickname.

179
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,814
Actually,
it's not even my nickname.

180
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,381
When I was at school,

181
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:17,184
they used to called me loopy
'cause I was so fucking crazy.

182
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,453
So it was kind of close, right?

183
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:21,054
That's trippy, don't you think?

184
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:23,023
Yeah, must be fate.

185
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:26,761
So who is she?

186
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:29,631
Oh, some whore.

187
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,735
That's not nice.

188
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:35,804
Listen,
she charged me ten bucks,

189
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,238
so I don't know what else
you would call her.

190
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:41,810
I thought I was in love.

191
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:45,045
Got her name
tattooed on my hand,

192
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:46,581
went back to show her...

193
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:49,918
She was shagging
two of my friends.

194
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,519
That was the end of that.

195
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:56,758
That's fucking romantic,
is what that is.

196
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:28,348
Yeah, boss?

197
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,384
<i>I need for you</i>
<i>to go over to Dr. Gruber's,</i>

198
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:31,753
<i>pick something up for me.</i>

199
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,354
Uh-huh.

200
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:35,757
<i>You remember</i>
<i>the address, right?</i>

201
00:17:36,624 --> 00:17:37,592
Of course, I do.

202
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:01,950
Those are the bombers. 30 mills.

203
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:05,887
They're all sealed.

204
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,790
That's what
you said last time.

205
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:10,725
Hey, man, they were sealed.

206
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:13,160
Any tampering happened,
that was on the other end.

207
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:16,731
You sell this shit, you've got
to put your name on it, doc.

208
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:20,400
-Any blanks in this batch...
-Okay, okay, I get it.

209
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:23,638
I'll let 'em go for 15.

210
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,140
Okay, man.

211
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:29,043
Twelve.

212
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:30,912
I don't have time
for this shit, doc.

213
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,048
Fine. Ten.

214
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:40,989
Let me ask you something.

215
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:46,928
I've been having
some memory issues lately.

216
00:18:47,061 --> 00:18:48,730
Like what?

217
00:18:48,863 --> 00:18:51,131
Ah, forgetting names
and directions.

218
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,466
Shit like that.

219
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,569
How bad is it?

220
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:57,371
I forgot where I lived for
a few minutes this morning.

221
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,273
It's not the first time.

222
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:04,545
It's not good.
It's not good at all.

223
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,179
You should
get that checked out.

224
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:55,863
Good afternoon.

225
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:56,998
Hey.

226
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:00,535
Okay.

227
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:07,575
Have you heard of CTE?

228
00:20:09,677 --> 00:20:12,680
Stands for Chronic
Traumatic Encephalopathy.

229
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:16,617
Lots of football players
and boxers develop it.

230
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,687
Too many blows to the head.

231
00:20:19,821 --> 00:20:21,421
Punch drunk.

232
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:23,091
That's what
they used to call it.

233
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,094
Have you sustained

234
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:29,229
multiple concussions
over the course of your life?

235
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:31,699
You could say that.

236
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,602
Starting at what age?

237
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:36,436
I don't know.

238
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:40,942
First one was probably
around six or seven.

239
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:42,242
Maybe younger.

240
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:46,180
So, this took place at home?

241
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:47,447
Just tell me what I got

242
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:49,449
and what I need to take
to get better.

243
00:20:52,854 --> 00:20:54,856
There is no treatment.

244
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:57,592
No drugs.

245
00:20:57,725 --> 00:21:00,561
And it's
a fairly advanced case.

246
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:08,301
Do you...

247
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,004
have anyone?

248
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:12,472
Wife?

249
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:14,075
Kids?

250
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,310
No, I don't know.

251
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:20,148
I've got a couple of kids. Why?

252
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:22,784
In the next couple of years,

253
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:25,586
you can expect
a fairly sharp decline.

254
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:30,591
Eventually, you won't be
able to care for yourself.

255
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,828
Bullshit.

256
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:37,665
I know it's hard...

257
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,499
Listen, you don't know me.

258
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:42,170
Just tell me
how long I have.

259
00:21:44,071 --> 00:21:47,340
Until you're incapacitated?
I can't predict that.

260
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,811
Just tell me,
how long do I have?

261
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,950
I don't know.

262
00:21:59,053 --> 00:22:01,856
A couple of years
at the most.

263
00:22:04,592 --> 00:22:05,626
Could be sooner.

264
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:58,372
<i>-Hello?</i>
<i>-Hello, Daisy.</i>

265
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,741
<i>Dad?</i>

266
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:04,312
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

267
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:06,247
No.

268
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,682
<i>Did someone</i>
<i>die or something?</i>

269
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:11,585
I just wanted to say hello.

270
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:12,687
<i>Are you drunk?</i>

271
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:15,189
No!

272
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:17,325
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>do you want then?</i>

273
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,593
Can I come by and see you?

274
00:24:19,727 --> 00:24:20,928
<i>Uh, fuck no.</i>

275
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:24,265
Okay.

276
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:26,434
I didn't mean to bother you.

277
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,169
<i>No,</i>
<i>I don't want to see you.</i>

278
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:29,704
<i>We have nothing to talk about.</i>

279
00:24:29,837 --> 00:24:31,872
<i>I've got an okay thing</i>
<i>going on right now.</i>

280
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:33,975
<i>And I don't need you</i>
<i>or anyone else</i>

281
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:35,343
<i>fucking it up for me.</i>

282
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,311
Mmm-hmm...

283
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:38,980
Okay.

284
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:41,615
Have you heard from...

285
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:46,954
My... my son?

286
00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:49,757
<i>Your son?</i>
<i>You mean Colin?</i>

287
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:52,526
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Colin.

288
00:24:57,131 --> 00:24:59,000
You have his number?

289
00:24:59,133 --> 00:25:00,768
I want to go see him.

290
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,138
<i>Colin's dead.</i>

291
00:25:05,306 --> 00:25:06,307
What?

292
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:08,642
When?

293
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:10,344
<i>Almost two years ago.</i>

294
00:25:12,546 --> 00:25:13,647
But...

295
00:25:14,882 --> 00:25:15,883
What...

296
00:25:16,951 --> 00:25:18,853
Why didn't anybody tell me?

297
00:25:19,887 --> 00:25:21,555
<i>Why would they, Dad?</i>

298
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:23,691
<i>You didn't even remember</i>
<i>his fucking name.</i>

299
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:26,660
Where... where is he buried?

300
00:25:34,835 --> 00:25:36,337
Colin, Colin...

301
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:38,906
Colin...

302
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:41,909
Colin, Colin...

303
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,248
Fucking idiot.

304
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:49,083
Colin...

305
00:26:28,756 --> 00:26:31,659
You should take better
fucking care of this place!

306
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:27,648
I thought I told you
not to come.

307
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:29,984
Just wanted to see you.

308
00:27:30,117 --> 00:27:32,386
Okay. Well, you saw me.

309
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:34,054
You can fuck off now, Dad.

310
00:27:34,623 --> 00:27:35,557
Excuse me.

311
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:42,631
This is
un-fucking believable.

312
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:45,799
And to invite you
and your family to dinner.

313
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:48,869
And why on earth
would I want to do that?

314
00:27:52,507 --> 00:27:53,707
Hi, sweetie.

315
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:56,143
I'm your grandfather.

316
00:27:57,646 --> 00:27:59,548
Get your butt
back inside.

317
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:07,454
Why are you... Why are you
selling the house?

318
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:10,357
You really think
I can afford to buy a house?

319
00:28:10,491 --> 00:28:11,458
I rent it.

320
00:28:11,593 --> 00:28:12,760
The owner died

321
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:14,828
and his kids are selling it
out from under us.

322
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,364
Are you working?

323
00:28:18,332 --> 00:28:19,433
I'm dancing.

324
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,968
Stripping?

325
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:22,903
No,
I joined the fucking Bolshoi.

326
00:28:23,037 --> 00:28:24,271
Hey, hey, hey.

327
00:28:24,405 --> 00:28:26,006
-Hey, Mom!
-Hi.

328
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,408
Um...

329
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:29,678
This is your grandfather.

330
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:32,947
Hey.

331
00:28:34,315 --> 00:28:35,684
So, you're the boxer?

332
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:37,451
Was.

333
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,690
You... you play for Dorchester?

334
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:43,224
Newton.

335
00:28:43,357 --> 00:28:45,726
Newton?
They have a football team?

336
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:48,028
He punched out
the Dorchester coach's son,

337
00:28:48,162 --> 00:28:49,664
and they kicked him
off the team.

338
00:28:49,797 --> 00:28:52,701
It's not funny.

339
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:54,768
I don't even want him
playing football.

340
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:56,870
You've got to go clean up.

341
00:28:57,004 --> 00:28:58,906
I could smell you
coming from a mile away.

342
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,107
-Smell this!
-Goodbye.

343
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:08,916
What, did you find Jesus
or something?

344
00:29:10,884 --> 00:29:12,587
I just want to explain...

345
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:16,790
You...
you don't understand...

346
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:18,292
No, that's just it.

347
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,094
I do understand.

348
00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:22,329
You were a fucking asshole
to us.

349
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:24,498
Just like my babies' daddies
are assholes.

350
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:26,300
Just like your dad
was an asshole.

351
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,002
And his dad, and on and on.

352
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:32,139
Back to the asshole caveman
that spawned you all.

353
00:29:32,273 --> 00:29:33,907
It's a fucking family curse.

354
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:37,845
The curse
of the asshole father.

355
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,151
The dinner,
just think about it, yeah?

356
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,355
Okay.

357
00:29:48,489 --> 00:29:49,624
I thought about it.

358
00:29:50,357 --> 00:29:51,325
Fuck off.

359
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,358
Dad?

360
00:30:57,491 --> 00:30:58,492
Yeah.

361
00:31:02,096 --> 00:31:03,665
I thought you were dead.

362
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:04,799
Nah.

363
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:07,501
It don't work that way.

364
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:21,215
Are you still mad?

365
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:27,522
Nah.

366
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:30,224
I ain't mad no more, kid.

367
00:31:33,927 --> 00:31:34,962
We gonna fish?

368
00:31:38,666 --> 00:31:39,634
Nah.

369
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:48,643
Where are we going?

370
00:31:49,943 --> 00:31:50,944
You'll see.

371
00:31:52,881 --> 00:31:54,582
I don't see any land.

372
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,753
Enjoy the ride.
There'll be land soon enough.

373
00:32:00,053 --> 00:32:01,054
Promise?

374
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:02,923
I promise.

375
00:32:06,895 --> 00:32:08,128
What is that sound?

376
00:32:10,164 --> 00:32:11,265
It's a guitar.

377
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:13,735
It's in the engine.

378
00:33:44,324 --> 00:33:45,660
Yo!

379
00:33:47,461 --> 00:33:48,696
Yo, you lost?

380
00:33:50,698 --> 00:33:51,699
Come on.

381
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:55,703
Yeah, you're the boy
our parents warned us about.

382
00:33:55,837 --> 00:33:59,072
-Look at you now.
-Mmm-hmm.

383
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:00,842
So what do you do?

384
00:34:00,975 --> 00:34:03,076
What's you, a gangster?

385
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,580
Huh? You a gangster?

386
00:34:05,713 --> 00:34:07,849
Were you born
without a filter,

387
00:34:07,982 --> 00:34:10,083
or is that something
you have to work at?

388
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:12,486
Ugh. Whatever.

389
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,255
Nah, it's all just
a bunch of boo-boo.

390
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,390
"Boo-boo"?

391
00:34:16,524 --> 00:34:18,091
Well, you know...

392
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:20,895
You know,
boo-boo just means like...

393
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:22,664
Some weak ass bullshit.

394
00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:26,768
Life ain't weak.

395
00:34:30,939 --> 00:34:32,072
Life's a shitstorm.

396
00:34:34,776 --> 00:34:37,712
But it sure as hell
ain't a bunch of boo-boo.

397
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:38,813
Wow.

398
00:34:40,014 --> 00:34:41,716
So deep!

399
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,252
I feel like I need to run.
Let's race!

400
00:34:45,385 --> 00:34:46,486
-Come on, let's race!
-No.

401
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:48,890
Oh, oh, oh.
Okay, soccer knee, soccer knee.

402
00:34:50,357 --> 00:34:51,926
How about backwards race?

403
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,728
-That's even worse.
-What?

404
00:34:53,861 --> 00:34:55,329
-It's worse.
-Come on! Come on!

405
00:34:55,462 --> 00:34:56,463
Stop it, there's people looking.

406
00:34:56,598 --> 00:34:57,665
There's people looking.

407
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:59,901
Oh, they gonna look,
all right. Come on!

408
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:01,636
You gonna buy me a Guinness?

409
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:04,639
I'll make 'em stop looking
if you buy me a Guinness.

410
00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:06,874
Come on, you gangster, boo-boo!

411
00:35:09,944 --> 00:35:12,279
Hey,
where's the screaming drunk?

412
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:16,216
It's too early for him.

413
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,585
He's a closing act.

414
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:26,259
What are these bumps
in your tattoos?

415
00:35:26,794 --> 00:35:27,795
Scars.

416
00:35:30,064 --> 00:35:32,066
Cigarette burns.

417
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:34,969
Life gives you lemons,
you make flowers.

418
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:38,039
Who did this to you?

419
00:35:39,507 --> 00:35:40,642
Some asshole.

420
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,679
I don't want to talk about it.

421
00:36:12,807 --> 00:36:14,942
I see you got your own scars.

422
00:36:15,076 --> 00:36:16,844
Yeah, well, who doesn't?

423
00:36:18,946 --> 00:36:20,180
How'd you get those?

424
00:36:20,915 --> 00:36:22,116
Some asshole.

425
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:32,794
Where you going?

426
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:34,494
Have to go to New York.

427
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:39,667
You not gonna
kiss me goodbye?

428
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:40,768
No.

429
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:45,106
I don't have time for that.

430
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:47,441
Hmm...

431
00:36:47,575 --> 00:36:49,110
Quite the sweet talker you are.

432
00:37:13,568 --> 00:37:14,569
Hey.

433
00:37:16,738 --> 00:37:18,271
Hey, you deaf?

434
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,708
What?

435
00:37:20,842 --> 00:37:23,376
I asked, how much longer
to stay on I-90?

436
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:27,081
Why aren't you
using your "gorithm"?

437
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:30,051
Yeah, very funny, smart-ass.

438
00:37:30,184 --> 00:37:32,687
You said you've been to New York
like a million times.

439
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,856
So, what's the best way
to get there?

440
00:37:39,459 --> 00:37:40,828
Did you forget?

441
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:43,231
No.

442
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:44,732
Go ahead. Use your toy.

443
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:47,835
Yeah, I think you forgot
how to get there.

444
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,570
Bullshit.

445
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:17,265
They said
the northeast corner.

446
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:19,299
Where should I park?

447
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:21,102
Make a loop.

448
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:26,641
What are you looking for?

449
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,342
Anything that doesn't fit.

450
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:33,181
Keep driving.

451
00:38:36,217 --> 00:38:37,652
Slower. Slower...

452
00:39:03,443 --> 00:39:04,411
Is that us?

453
00:39:15,923 --> 00:39:16,891
Yeah.

454
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:21,195
-I'll see you back in Boston.
-Hey, no, no, no.

455
00:39:23,764 --> 00:39:25,066
I'm coming with you.

456
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,667
No, it's not happening.

457
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:28,202
Jeez,
what is wrong with you?

458
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:31,371
Pop says he wants me
to learn the business

459
00:39:31,505 --> 00:39:33,241
from the bottom up.
Remember?

460
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:35,343
I got news for you.

461
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:38,913
This business is all done
on the bottom.

462
00:39:48,723 --> 00:39:50,558
I want to know
what's back there.

463
00:39:50,691 --> 00:39:52,927
No, you don't.

464
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,796
On jobs like this,
you got to learn not to look.

465
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:58,099
Just do your business.
And look the other way.

466
00:40:10,177 --> 00:40:11,145
Cops.

467
00:40:13,514 --> 00:40:14,682
Fuck.

468
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:19,186
Just be cool.

469
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,689
Aw, shit!

470
00:40:27,494 --> 00:40:28,529
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

471
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:33,768
Do me a favor
and get on the floor.

472
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:35,870
What?

473
00:40:36,003 --> 00:40:37,437
-Get on the floor.
-Why?

474
00:40:38,372 --> 00:40:39,472
When this guy passes us,

475
00:40:39,607 --> 00:40:41,943
he's gonna
take a good, long look.

476
00:40:42,076 --> 00:40:44,412
And I don't need him
seeing you shit your pants.

477
00:40:44,545 --> 00:40:45,478
I'm... I'm cool.

478
00:40:45,613 --> 00:40:47,682
-I'm cool.
-You're not.

479
00:40:47,815 --> 00:40:49,317
Do me a favor, get down.

480
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:50,818
-Fuck!
-Get on the fucking...

481
00:40:50,952 --> 00:40:53,020
No, I'm not getting
on the fucking floor.

482
00:40:54,722 --> 00:40:55,856
Hey, stop.

483
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:58,592
Get down, now, get down!

484
00:40:58,726 --> 00:40:59,660
Let me up!

485
00:40:59,794 --> 00:41:01,829
Get down and stay there,
stay down.

486
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:03,463
Stay there.

487
00:41:30,091 --> 00:41:31,993
This is fucking bullshit, man.

488
00:41:34,395 --> 00:41:36,297
I'm telling Pops
what you just did to me.

489
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,932
You mean saving your ass?

490
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:41,869
I'm getting sick
of the lack of respect

491
00:41:42,003 --> 00:41:43,637
that you've been showing me.

492
00:41:43,771 --> 00:41:45,639
They don't just hand
that shit out, son.

493
00:41:45,773 --> 00:41:47,074
You've got to earn it.

494
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:03,491
And I know you're talking shit
to my old man about me.

495
00:42:05,493 --> 00:42:07,495
Trying to hold me back.

496
00:42:07,628 --> 00:42:09,897
That rocket fuel's
making you paranoid.

497
00:42:40,361 --> 00:42:41,896
If it ain't the dinosaur.

498
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:44,498
Hey, fuckpig,
where do you want this?

499
00:42:44,632 --> 00:42:46,700
Take it around back,
Jurassic Park.

500
00:42:47,635 --> 00:42:49,103
What are you smirking at?

501
00:43:01,282 --> 00:43:04,251
What are you doing?
Don't get out.

502
00:43:04,385 --> 00:43:07,054
Those guys don't want us
seeing what's back there.

503
00:43:13,528 --> 00:43:14,929
You afraid of that guy?

504
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:17,598
Just stay put.

505
00:43:27,174 --> 00:43:28,876
Get her! Let's go!

506
00:43:29,009 --> 00:43:30,277
Holy shit.

507
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:31,378
I'm going to break your legs!

508
00:43:31,513 --> 00:43:32,613
Stop!

509
00:43:34,381 --> 00:43:36,317
Help. Please, help me.

510
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:37,751
No! I want to go!

511
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:39,120
Get down!

512
00:43:39,253 --> 00:43:40,988
Come down!

513
00:43:41,122 --> 00:43:42,123
No!

514
00:43:42,957 --> 00:43:44,058
No!

515
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:45,326
Get the shit back off!

516
00:43:47,928 --> 00:43:49,263
I want to go!

517
00:43:49,396 --> 00:43:50,565
Shut the fuck up!

518
00:43:50,698 --> 00:43:51,832
Help!

519
00:43:51,966 --> 00:43:54,034
-Shut the fuck up!
-Help!

520
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:56,605
Shut up!

521
00:44:00,107 --> 00:44:02,376
No! No!

522
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,620
All right, here we go,
number four!

523
00:44:11,752 --> 00:44:13,988
Here we go. You got this!

524
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:16,891
Come on, Dre!
Knock him on his ass!

525
00:44:21,596 --> 00:44:22,763
Come on, Dre.

526
00:44:23,632 --> 00:44:25,332
Get up off the ground.

527
00:44:25,466 --> 00:44:27,935
Come on, focus!

528
00:44:28,068 --> 00:44:30,204
Come on. You've got this.
All right. All right.

529
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:32,306
-Here we go! Here we go!
-Hit it, hit it!

530
00:44:35,743 --> 00:44:37,646
Don't like him
playing football, huh?

531
00:44:42,082 --> 00:44:43,050
Do you mind?

532
00:44:43,784 --> 00:44:45,786
Free country.

533
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,222
Jesus, he's playing terrible.

534
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:49,723
Come on!

535
00:44:50,224 --> 00:44:51,526
Hit somebody!

536
00:44:56,397 --> 00:44:58,533
Please tell me
that's not a beer in there.

537
00:45:05,674 --> 00:45:07,708
Here we go! Here we go!
Yeah, Dre!

538
00:45:07,841 --> 00:45:09,743
That's my boy!

539
00:45:10,512 --> 00:45:12,581
Yes! Yes!

540
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:15,416
-Touchdown!
-Touchdown!

541
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,921
All right, let's do it again!

542
00:45:23,592 --> 00:45:26,060
Okay, excuse me, where's
my little Patriots player?

543
00:45:26,193 --> 00:45:27,662
Give me a hug. Oh, my God.

544
00:45:27,795 --> 00:45:30,164
You are so good.

545
00:45:30,297 --> 00:45:31,666
I am so proud of you.

546
00:45:31,799 --> 00:45:34,435
-Thank you, Mom.
-Yeah, all right.

547
00:45:34,569 --> 00:45:36,070
We've got to go pick up Katie.

548
00:45:36,203 --> 00:45:37,871
You looked good out there.

549
00:45:38,005 --> 00:45:39,674
Ah. I did okay.

550
00:45:41,175 --> 00:45:42,677
Here's something for you.

551
00:45:50,184 --> 00:45:51,686
That's my old reel.

552
00:45:51,819 --> 00:45:53,754
It's a Pflueger.

553
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:56,625
It ain't for the heavy-duty
deep-sea stuff, but...

554
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:59,293
it'll be good for what you need.

555
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:02,229
-But... I don't fish.
-It doesn't matter.

556
00:46:02,363 --> 00:46:03,497
What do you say?

557
00:46:03,632 --> 00:46:04,932
Well, thank you.

558
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:08,135
All right,
we've got to go get Katie.

559
00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:09,436
But you said I could stay

560
00:46:09,571 --> 00:46:11,972
and watch the next game
with my friends.

561
00:46:12,106 --> 00:46:14,308
I did? Fine.
Just be home by dinner.

562
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:16,477
-Okay, bye, Mom.
-Okay. Bye, I love you.

563
00:46:19,046 --> 00:46:21,616
Didn't the court say you
couldn't hang out in parks?

564
00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:24,018
Take it easy.

565
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:30,424
Yo, Dre!

566
00:46:30,558 --> 00:46:31,559
There you are.

567
00:46:33,762 --> 00:46:36,598
-I want to go with my friends.
-You're riding home with me.

568
00:46:36,731 --> 00:46:38,432
-Wait...
-I promised your mom.

569
00:46:41,135 --> 00:46:42,136
Come on.

570
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:57,951
I have a question for you.

571
00:47:01,155 --> 00:47:03,457
Why did you punch
that coach's son out?

572
00:47:07,461 --> 00:47:08,829
He cheap-shotted me.

573
00:47:11,865 --> 00:47:14,234
Sometimes
you've just got to walk away.

574
00:47:24,713 --> 00:47:26,347
Mom says you were in prison.

575
00:47:28,115 --> 00:47:29,083
What for?

576
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:31,185
Not walking away.

577
00:47:33,621 --> 00:47:35,989
I've done so much
stupid shit in my life,

578
00:47:36,123 --> 00:47:37,391
I can't even tell you.

579
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,366
Are you still doing
stupid shit?

580
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:54,576
Mom said you probably were.

581
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:57,712
What else
did your mom tell you?

582
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,017
That you...

583
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,222
That you ran out
on your family.

584
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:13,427
Is it true?

585
00:48:25,707 --> 00:48:26,974
What was boxing like?

586
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:43,858
What are you doing here?

587
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:45,225
It ain't the end of the month.

588
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,361
This is my grandson.

589
00:48:47,494 --> 00:48:49,731
I want him
to take a look around.

590
00:48:49,864 --> 00:48:52,099
You want to be a boxer
like your grandfather?

591
00:48:53,768 --> 00:48:55,469
Mmm...
I don't really know.

592
00:48:55,603 --> 00:48:56,571
Hey.

593
00:48:56,704 --> 00:48:58,540
This guy, back in the day,

594
00:48:58,673 --> 00:48:59,607
if he punched you,

595
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:01,275
your fucking
ancestors would feel it.

596
00:49:02,443 --> 00:49:04,077
You think I'm joking?

597
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:05,814
Make yourself at home, kid.

598
00:49:10,317 --> 00:49:12,821
Hey. Watch these two.

599
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:17,424
Which one's better?

600
00:49:19,794 --> 00:49:22,129
They both look good to me.

601
00:49:22,262 --> 00:49:25,299
Watch their footwork.
Just their footwork.

602
00:49:28,903 --> 00:49:30,839
The guy on the right
has more power.

603
00:49:31,906 --> 00:49:33,808
But watch the girl.

604
00:49:33,942 --> 00:49:36,644
She's coming at him
from five different angles.

605
00:49:36,778 --> 00:49:39,012
Moving, sticking,
getting out of there.

606
00:49:40,047 --> 00:49:41,114
See what I mean?

607
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:45,319
Calm, controlled,
moving fast.

608
00:49:45,452 --> 00:49:47,956
Okay, now start punching.
Two lefts. Left!

609
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:49,089
Right.

610
00:49:49,657 --> 00:49:50,792
Don't stay still.

611
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:54,127
I'm gonna hit you
if you stay still.

612
00:49:55,897 --> 00:49:57,665
Left, right.

613
00:49:57,799 --> 00:50:00,935
Left, right. That's it.

614
00:50:01,068 --> 00:50:04,004
Don't stay still.
Don't stay still, that's it.

615
00:50:05,707 --> 00:50:08,008
Back over this way.
Keep moving.

616
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:10,043
Good job.

617
00:50:12,312 --> 00:50:13,882
There you go.

618
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:15,415
You're a natural, kid.

619
00:50:36,604 --> 00:50:37,572
Hey.

620
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,241
Don't tell your mom
I took you to the gym.

621
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:43,678
You afraid of her?

622
00:50:44,311 --> 00:50:46,046
Damn right, I am.

623
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:47,180
Me, too.

624
00:51:46,406 --> 00:51:48,108
The water's really cold.

625
00:51:49,043 --> 00:51:50,277
On top, it is.

626
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:52,647
But not down deep.

627
00:51:55,049 --> 00:51:56,985
Did you go to the bottom?

628
00:51:57,117 --> 00:51:58,218
Sure I did.

629
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:02,489
Is that where guys
like us belong?

630
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:05,459
Yeah.

631
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:13,668
Help me, help me!

632
00:52:21,109 --> 00:52:22,644
Just don't think about it.

633
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,781
Hey!

634
00:52:28,248 --> 00:52:29,550
Just don't think about it.

635
00:52:30,618 --> 00:52:31,853
Do like I taught you.

636
00:52:33,153 --> 00:52:34,287
Look the other way

637
00:52:35,089 --> 00:52:36,658
and enjoy the music.

638
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,236
<i>He used to take me</i>
<i>fishing every Sunday.</i>

639
00:53:57,237 --> 00:53:59,207
<i>Every single Sunday.</i>

640
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:02,442
<i>Just me and him.</i>

641
00:54:06,514 --> 00:54:08,850
<i>I wasn't allowed to set foot</i>
<i>in that boat</i>

642
00:54:08,983 --> 00:54:10,218
<i>if he wasn't with me.</i>

643
00:54:19,894 --> 00:54:23,497
<i>He gets arrested</i>
<i>this one Saturday night.</i>

644
00:54:23,631 --> 00:54:27,602
<i>And we can't raise the money</i>
<i>to bail him out until Monday.</i>

645
00:54:27,735 --> 00:54:30,004
<i>So, I figured</i>
<i>I would take the boat out,</i>

646
00:54:30,138 --> 00:54:33,141
<i>and he'd never</i>
<i>find out about it.</i>

647
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,014
<i>He found out.</i>

648
00:54:51,793 --> 00:54:53,661
<i>He never took me</i>
<i>fishing again.</i>

649
00:55:00,568 --> 00:55:03,237
<i>It was the one thing</i>
<i>we loved doing together.</i>

650
00:55:08,943 --> 00:55:10,978
<i>And he took it away</i>
<i>to punish me.</i>

651
00:55:19,452 --> 00:55:21,522
Waiting for the presents.

652
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:27,327
Things are happening.

653
00:55:29,263 --> 00:55:30,397
Jurassic Park!

654
00:55:31,464 --> 00:55:33,134
What are you doing here
on a Sunday?

655
00:55:33,267 --> 00:55:34,669
You got some girls here,
right?

656
00:55:34,802 --> 00:55:36,804
I thought maybe
I'd take a look.

657
00:55:39,941 --> 00:55:43,744
You're a dirty old dinosaur,
homie! Mmm...

658
00:55:43,878 --> 00:55:45,580
We got Viagra too,
if you need it.

659
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:48,816
Come on, OG.

660
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:51,351
Hey.

661
00:55:51,484 --> 00:55:52,987
I've got to
give you props, <i>viejo.</i>

662
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,022
You delivered us a good crop
right there.

663
00:55:55,957 --> 00:55:57,158
All right, now!

664
00:55:57,291 --> 00:55:58,458
Lovely ladies.

665
00:55:59,126 --> 00:56:00,460
Smile for me.

666
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:07,568
Hey, come here. Smile.

667
00:56:08,302 --> 00:56:09,303
Smile.

668
00:56:10,771 --> 00:56:11,739
Ooh!

669
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:15,375
Trouble, ah, come.

670
00:56:15,509 --> 00:56:17,044
She's my favorite.

671
00:56:17,178 --> 00:56:19,680
Whole lotta trouble right here,
if you like that kind of stuff.

672
00:56:23,084 --> 00:56:24,785
Smile.

673
00:56:24,919 --> 00:56:26,554
Put on a smile, beautiful.

674
00:56:29,523 --> 00:56:32,226
Come now, off you go!
Smile.

675
00:57:06,227 --> 00:57:08,262
No, no, no.

676
00:57:26,047 --> 00:57:27,081
I don't...

677
00:57:28,716 --> 00:57:30,251
I don't know why I'm here.

678
00:57:40,761 --> 00:57:44,332
Do... Do you have family
in the US?

679
00:57:45,433 --> 00:57:46,634
<i>Familia?</i>

680
00:57:50,805 --> 00:57:52,039
You want me to call?

681
00:57:58,446 --> 00:57:59,479
They already know.

682
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:03,851
They know?

683
00:58:10,124 --> 00:58:11,459
Diego wants money...

684
00:58:12,927 --> 00:58:14,695
How much?

685
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:16,163
Twenty-thousand.

686
00:58:16,297 --> 00:58:19,000
20,000, and they let you go?

687
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:20,368
I will be free.

688
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:25,339
Fuck.

689
00:58:40,654 --> 00:58:42,089
I can't help you.

690
00:58:44,458 --> 00:58:45,860
I can't help you.

691
00:58:47,995 --> 00:58:48,996
I'm sorry.

692
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:15,356
Yeah?

693
00:59:15,489 --> 00:59:18,259
<i>Okay. The Priest</i>
<i>can meet you after mass.</i>

694
00:59:18,392 --> 00:59:19,660
Got it.

695
00:59:19,794 --> 00:59:22,329
<i>Get the whole nut,</i>
<i>right? No excuses.</i>

696
01:00:08,577 --> 01:00:11,479
Hey, Father.
What's the rush?

697
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:16,551
Fucking idiot.

698
01:00:52,621 --> 01:00:54,121
I...

699
01:00:54,255 --> 01:00:56,157
I don't know
what I was thinking.

700
01:01:09,136 --> 01:01:10,971
It's all there. 20,000.

701
01:01:13,575 --> 01:01:15,776
Don't want to know
where you got this.

702
01:01:16,777 --> 01:01:19,480
This'll buy you another month.

703
01:01:19,614 --> 01:01:22,651
Hey, Father, do you still
take confession?

704
01:01:22,783 --> 01:01:24,451
I don't have
that kind of time.

705
01:01:24,586 --> 01:01:25,986
I'll see you next month.

706
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:30,991
Shit!

707
01:01:35,863 --> 01:01:37,698
I shot a fucking priest.

708
01:01:37,831 --> 01:01:39,066
So, where's our guy?

709
01:01:41,902 --> 01:01:43,270
He must
still be in there.

710
01:03:00,615 --> 01:03:03,350
Who the fuck are you?
Do I know you?

711
01:03:06,787 --> 01:03:07,821
Who hired you?

712
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:11,392
Fuck you.

713
01:03:11,526 --> 01:03:13,460
You're gonna kill me
either way.

714
01:03:15,129 --> 01:03:17,231
Let me tell you
what's gonna happen.

715
01:03:18,265 --> 01:03:20,669
You'll be dead in a few minutes.

716
01:03:20,801 --> 01:03:23,772
And I'm gonna find out
where you live.

717
01:03:23,904 --> 01:03:26,440
I'm guessing,
I'm gonna find someone there.

718
01:03:28,643 --> 01:03:29,843
Maybe your girl.

719
01:03:43,157 --> 01:03:44,793
He's a big motherfucker.

720
01:03:47,027 --> 01:03:48,829
Big spider tat on his neck.

721
01:03:51,865 --> 01:03:53,367
He said
you'd be hard to kill.

722
01:05:27,995 --> 01:05:29,697
You don't think
these guys were there

723
01:05:29,831 --> 01:05:31,465
to take out the 20 grand,
do you?

724
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,535
That's not
what the guy told me.

725
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:37,471
You owe anybody any money?

726
01:05:37,605 --> 01:05:39,741
Nothing worth
that kind of attention.

727
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:42,811
Revenge?

728
01:05:43,578 --> 01:05:44,813
Now that's a long list.

729
01:05:49,651 --> 01:05:52,119
So, who the fuck
are these guys?

730
01:05:52,252 --> 01:05:53,855
Eh, just some
fucking amateurs.

731
01:05:56,724 --> 01:05:59,293
You know, I'm starting to
worry about you a little bit.

732
01:06:01,729 --> 01:06:02,831
You worried now?

733
01:06:06,901 --> 01:06:07,869
Nice work.

734
01:06:39,834 --> 01:06:40,835
Hey!

735
01:06:41,803 --> 01:06:43,003
Hey, what up, bud?

736
01:06:43,136 --> 01:06:44,404
You shouldn't be here.

737
01:06:44,539 --> 01:06:45,807
Oh, yeah, why not?

738
01:06:46,306 --> 01:06:48,075
Just go home.

739
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:50,712
So why don't you
park by your house?

740
01:06:50,845 --> 01:06:52,914
I like my privacy.

741
01:06:53,046 --> 01:06:54,916
I come all the way
out here to see you,

742
01:06:55,048 --> 01:06:56,518
and this is
the greeting I get?

743
01:06:56,651 --> 01:06:58,185
How do you even know
where I live?

744
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:01,388
I went through
your wallet the other day.

745
01:07:01,523 --> 01:07:04,057
I know, that sounded a little
crazy out loud, right?

746
01:07:04,893 --> 01:07:05,894
Come on!

747
01:07:06,493 --> 01:07:08,563
Cute place.

748
01:07:12,534 --> 01:07:14,234
It's a shitty rental.

749
01:07:20,374 --> 01:07:22,342
There's...
there's nothing to do here.

750
01:07:24,478 --> 01:07:26,046
We can watch TV?

751
01:07:27,114 --> 01:07:28,215
It doesn't work.

752
01:07:31,351 --> 01:07:32,687
How 'bout some music?

753
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:34,187
I don't have music.

754
01:07:34,321 --> 01:07:35,990
Everybody's got music.

755
01:07:36,123 --> 01:07:37,090
I don't.

756
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:53,942
Those aren't mine.

757
01:08:01,081 --> 01:08:02,215
Okay, they're mine.

758
01:08:13,061 --> 01:08:15,597
Did you notice
that I had memory problems?

759
01:08:17,832 --> 01:08:18,800
Yeah.

760
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,537
But I just thought
you were an alcoholic.

761
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:23,605
I am.

762
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,141
I'm a real prize.

763
01:08:38,519 --> 01:08:39,921
It's sure quiet here.

764
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,462
You know my son
I told you about?

765
01:08:49,129 --> 01:08:50,497
The one who died?

766
01:08:50,632 --> 01:08:51,633
Yeah.

767
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:56,303
He overdosed on heroin.

768
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:01,609
I'm sorry.

769
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:12,887
He was gay.

770
01:09:19,326 --> 01:09:20,928
Did that bother you?

771
01:09:21,062 --> 01:09:22,030
I don't know.

772
01:09:22,764 --> 01:09:24,164
I guess so, yeah.

773
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:27,300
Maybe if
I'd been around more

774
01:09:27,434 --> 01:09:29,469
when he was growing up,

775
01:09:29,604 --> 01:09:31,506
things would've been different.

776
01:09:35,009 --> 01:09:37,310
So what, you think
you're so fucking macho,

777
01:09:37,444 --> 01:09:39,279
it's just gonna
rub off on him?

778
01:09:40,313 --> 01:09:41,883
Shit don't work like that.

779
01:09:55,462 --> 01:09:58,099
We aren't gonna end well,
you and me.

780
01:09:58,231 --> 01:09:59,834
You know that, right?

781
01:10:12,345 --> 01:10:14,247
Yeah, we're like
that scene in the movies

782
01:10:14,381 --> 01:10:16,017
where the gasoline...

783
01:10:19,352 --> 01:10:20,988
moves slowly...

784
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:25,258
towards the flame.

785
01:10:30,198 --> 01:10:31,699
Sooner or later...

786
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,250
But not tonight.

787
01:11:16,043 --> 01:11:17,011
Hey.

788
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:24,819
It's me.

789
01:11:24,952 --> 01:11:26,621
Yeah, I know.

790
01:11:29,056 --> 01:11:30,158
What are you doing?

791
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:36,296
Listening to that guy
playing the guitar.

792
01:11:42,904 --> 01:11:43,938
What guitar?

793
01:11:46,073 --> 01:11:48,943
He... he was just playing.
Didn't you hear him?

794
01:11:50,611 --> 01:11:51,612
No.

795
01:11:53,881 --> 01:11:55,183
You're hearing things.

796
01:12:21,474 --> 01:12:23,177
I'm taking my daughter
and her kids

797
01:12:23,311 --> 01:12:25,179
out to dinner on Friday night.

798
01:12:26,346 --> 01:12:28,015
I want you to come with me.

799
01:12:31,118 --> 01:12:32,352
You sure about that?

800
01:12:33,654 --> 01:12:35,523
Yeah. I'm sure.

801
01:12:57,578 --> 01:12:59,213
You look nice.

802
01:12:59,347 --> 01:13:01,448
I need a drink.

803
01:13:01,582 --> 01:13:04,518
"Why, thank you.
You look lovely too."

804
01:13:07,321 --> 01:13:09,422
Hey! Can I get a drink?

805
01:13:09,557 --> 01:13:10,858
Sure.

806
01:13:10,992 --> 01:13:13,794
-Uh, double bourbon, rocks.
-What kind?

807
01:13:13,928 --> 01:13:15,395
The cheap kind.

808
01:13:18,566 --> 01:13:19,867
And for the lady?

809
01:13:20,001 --> 01:13:22,370
Uh, just a glass of water,
please.

810
01:13:26,507 --> 01:13:28,876
Calm down, Sally,
they'll be here.

811
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:31,078
It's all good. Come on.

812
01:13:39,086 --> 01:13:40,221
They aren't coming.

813
01:13:41,355 --> 01:13:42,489
They aren't coming.

814
01:13:42,623 --> 01:13:47,094
Maybe... maybe I gave her
the wrong address.

815
01:13:47,228 --> 01:13:49,797
Shit, I must've given them
the wrong address.

816
01:13:49,931 --> 01:13:51,198
Sorry, but I simply

817
01:13:51,332 --> 01:13:52,700
cannot hold this table
any longer.

818
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:53,768
Fuck off!

819
01:13:54,268 --> 01:13:55,236
Excuse me?

820
01:13:55,369 --> 01:13:57,171
I said, fuck off!

821
01:13:57,939 --> 01:13:59,640
Who says, "simply cannot"?

822
01:13:59,774 --> 01:14:01,943
No one talks like that.

823
01:14:02,076 --> 01:14:03,577
Would you
speak to our manager?

824
01:14:03,711 --> 01:14:06,847
No, no, no, no. That's...
That's not necessary.

825
01:14:06,981 --> 01:14:08,182
-Yeah.
-No!

826
01:14:08,316 --> 01:14:10,084
-Okay.
-No, no!

827
01:14:10,217 --> 01:14:12,253
Hey, hey, okay.

828
01:14:12,386 --> 01:14:14,956
What the fuck
are you looking at? Huh?

829
01:14:15,089 --> 01:14:17,124
High-end motherfuckers!

830
01:14:17,258 --> 01:14:18,793
-Okay.
-We were supposed to...

831
01:14:18,926 --> 01:14:20,027
Hey, hey, hey!

832
01:14:20,161 --> 01:14:22,596
-Let's just go...
-Where's the person

833
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,432
we were supposed to meet?

834
01:14:24,565 --> 01:14:25,599
Daisy.

835
01:14:25,733 --> 01:14:26,968
-Daisy?
-Yeah.

836
01:14:27,101 --> 01:14:28,602
What about Colin?

837
01:14:28,736 --> 01:14:30,404
Colin couldn't make it.

838
01:14:31,038 --> 01:14:32,006
Daisy?

839
01:14:33,473 --> 01:14:35,409
Yeah, your daughter.

840
01:14:35,543 --> 01:14:37,011
My daughter's not coming,
is she?

841
01:14:37,144 --> 01:14:39,146
No, I don't think
she's going to be able...

842
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,182
I gave her the wrong address...

843
01:14:41,315 --> 01:14:43,751
What... What...
My... my... my...

844
01:14:43,884 --> 01:14:45,786
My daughter's not coming,
is she?

845
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,421
No, she's not coming.

846
01:14:47,555 --> 01:14:49,090
What... what's her name?

847
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:51,625
Your daughter's name
is Daisy, baby.

848
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,469
What the hell's
happening here?

849
01:16:08,602 --> 01:16:10,604
Why didn't you tell me
you were sick?

850
01:16:13,508 --> 01:16:14,608
You told her?

851
01:16:14,742 --> 01:16:16,944
Yeah.
I called her last night.

852
01:16:17,078 --> 01:16:19,480
I mean, I thought, you know,
you were really upset.

853
01:16:19,613 --> 01:16:20,714
You fucking told her?

854
01:16:20,848 --> 01:16:22,983
-Hey!
-Yeah, she should know.

855
01:16:23,117 --> 01:16:24,452
Get out of my house.

856
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,888
Dad, stop.
She didn't mean anything.

857
01:16:28,022 --> 01:16:29,356
Get out,
or I'll throw you out.

858
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:30,559
Crazy fucking bitch!

859
01:16:30,691 --> 01:16:31,759
Cut it out!

860
01:16:33,828 --> 01:16:34,962
So, you want to hit me?

861
01:16:35,696 --> 01:16:36,630
You want to hit me?

862
01:16:37,331 --> 01:16:38,265
Okay.

863
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:39,633
Okay, fucking hit me.

864
01:16:39,767 --> 01:16:42,036
Hit me, you fucking pussy.
I know you want to.

865
01:16:42,169 --> 01:16:43,637
Dre,
get back in the car.

866
01:16:45,005 --> 01:16:48,142
Dre! Please! Go,
get in the car right now.

867
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:50,411
Go!

868
01:17:20,641 --> 01:17:22,176
I didn't want you to know.

869
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:23,777
Okay.

870
01:17:23,911 --> 01:17:25,446
Well,
she didn't deserve that.

871
01:17:28,482 --> 01:17:29,483
Fuck.

872
01:17:37,858 --> 01:17:40,761
Why... why didn't you come
to dinner last night?

873
01:17:40,895 --> 01:17:43,197
Says the guy who walked away
and never came back.

874
01:17:44,098 --> 01:17:45,332
You suck.

875
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:53,974
I've got to go pack,

876
01:17:54,108 --> 01:17:56,310
'cause now we've got to be
out in two days.

877
01:17:56,443 --> 01:17:58,547
Where... where will you go?

878
01:17:58,679 --> 01:17:59,980
I'll figure it out.

879
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:03,017
Is there...
is there anything I can do?

880
01:18:05,386 --> 01:18:07,522
I can take care of myself.

881
01:18:12,993 --> 01:18:14,495
Are you gonna get treatment?

882
01:18:15,162 --> 01:18:16,163
I don't know.

883
01:18:17,831 --> 01:18:20,334
Well, you got a doctor?

884
01:18:20,467 --> 01:18:23,304
I did.
That bitch can't help me.

885
01:18:23,437 --> 01:18:24,405
Christ.

886
01:18:28,842 --> 01:18:30,477
Hey.

887
01:18:30,612 --> 01:18:32,813
Do you need my help
to find a new doctor?

888
01:18:35,149 --> 01:18:36,685
Why...
Why would you do that?

889
01:18:41,623 --> 01:18:44,693
Well, if you need my help,
let me know.

890
01:18:55,302 --> 01:18:57,071
Life's a shitstorm, isn't it?

891
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:43,518
What's her name?

892
01:19:45,452 --> 01:19:46,621
What's her fucking name?

893
01:19:49,056 --> 01:19:50,090
Fuck.

894
01:19:53,728 --> 01:19:54,696
Yeah.

895
01:19:55,496 --> 01:19:57,164
Maybe my son...

896
01:19:57,965 --> 01:19:59,199
He's dead...

897
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:00,702
Yeah, he was a big dude...

898
01:20:00,834 --> 01:20:02,036
Dude, dude...

899
01:20:06,473 --> 01:20:08,777
Ta-ta, tattoo, tattoo...

900
01:20:09,443 --> 01:20:11,111
Big dude, tattoo...

901
01:20:11,245 --> 01:20:12,946
Big dude, tattoo...

902
01:20:13,814 --> 01:20:14,783
on his neck.

903
01:20:14,915 --> 01:20:16,116
I can't remember it.

904
01:20:17,918 --> 01:20:20,321
You fuckin' idiot!
Fuckin' idiot.

905
01:20:20,454 --> 01:20:22,289
<i>Fuck you! Big dude.</i>

906
01:20:22,423 --> 01:20:24,158
Fuck you. Tattoo!

907
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:26,860
Tattoo! Fuck you! Fuck you!

908
01:20:26,994 --> 01:20:27,961
Fuck you!

909
01:20:29,764 --> 01:20:32,032
Fuck you, you, you!

910
01:20:38,272 --> 01:20:40,809
Here comes the packing train!
Choo-choo!

911
01:20:40,941 --> 01:20:43,377
Thank you. Keep it coming.

912
01:20:47,981 --> 01:20:50,484
Choo-choo!
Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga...

913
01:20:50,618 --> 01:20:52,486
Train is leaving the station.

914
01:20:55,657 --> 01:20:58,392
Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga,
chugga-chugga...

915
01:21:02,162 --> 01:21:03,163
What?

916
01:21:04,164 --> 01:21:06,668
Um... I need to talk to Dre.

917
01:21:10,638 --> 01:21:11,639
All right.

918
01:21:21,882 --> 01:21:22,883
Hey.

919
01:21:29,223 --> 01:21:30,224
Can we talk?

920
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:37,398
Dre, I...

921
01:21:42,704 --> 01:21:43,705
It's hard.

922
01:21:45,172 --> 01:21:47,107
Life, life... Life is hard.

923
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:52,647
I, uh...

924
01:21:57,585 --> 01:21:58,586
I...

925
01:22:12,266 --> 01:22:14,268
What you saw yesterday...

926
01:22:15,269 --> 01:22:16,303
my anger.

927
01:22:18,071 --> 01:22:19,273
What I'm saying is,

928
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,408
don't be like that.

929
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:23,812
Don't be like me.

930
01:22:54,441 --> 01:22:55,910
Fucking idiot.

931
01:23:10,959 --> 01:23:12,493
$40,000.

932
01:23:14,261 --> 01:23:15,329
It's...

933
01:23:15,462 --> 01:23:17,765
It's for a downpayment
on a house...

934
01:23:18,766 --> 01:23:20,501
For my daughter, Daisy.

935
01:23:23,504 --> 01:23:27,742
Mr. Connor, I know
that's a lot of money, but...

936
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:34,047
I'm willing to pay whatever
interest you decide on.

937
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:38,586
Mr. Connor...

938
01:23:42,155 --> 01:23:43,090
<i>So...</i>

939
01:23:43,223 --> 01:23:44,224
Mr. Connor...

940
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:49,263
I know 40,000
is a lot of money, but...

941
01:23:49,396 --> 01:23:52,399
I've been working for you
for 30 years.

942
01:23:52,534 --> 01:23:54,869
30 long years. And...

943
01:24:14,221 --> 01:24:15,255
Mr. Connor?

944
01:24:17,391 --> 01:24:18,560
Have a seat.

945
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:24,566
-Who's...
-He works for me.

946
01:24:30,538 --> 01:24:32,006
So...

947
01:24:32,139 --> 01:24:35,342
I saw doctor Gruber yesterday.
He came by for his Oxy money.

948
01:24:37,579 --> 01:24:38,580
Okay.

949
01:24:41,148 --> 01:24:42,684
He said something about

950
01:24:42,817 --> 01:24:46,186
you maybe having some sort
of brain disease or something.

951
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,622
He said I might.

952
01:24:52,359 --> 01:24:55,530
I mean, I can't even put
into words how sorry I am...

953
01:24:55,663 --> 01:24:56,798
Get to the point.

954
01:24:59,567 --> 01:25:00,935
I have to let you go.

955
01:25:02,904 --> 01:25:04,038
Let me go?

956
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:07,709
Boss! It's...

957
01:25:07,842 --> 01:25:09,276
it's me! I'm fine.

958
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:11,211
Please.

959
01:25:12,446 --> 01:25:15,783
What about the other day?
The... the shooters?

960
01:25:15,917 --> 01:25:17,117
I got all your money.

961
01:25:18,086 --> 01:25:19,921
What's your phone number?

962
01:25:30,665 --> 01:25:32,533
617...

963
01:25:41,676 --> 01:25:42,877
What's your address?

964
01:25:53,121 --> 01:25:55,657
"Gee, SpongeBob,
I don't know..."

965
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:57,659
-Kyle!
-No, fuck this guy!

966
01:26:04,498 --> 01:26:05,499
Sorry.

967
01:26:05,633 --> 01:26:06,901
I can't have somebody

968
01:26:07,035 --> 01:26:09,037
in your condition
working for me.

969
01:26:09,169 --> 01:26:10,370
It's just too risky.

970
01:26:18,513 --> 01:26:20,081
So, that's it?

971
01:26:22,482 --> 01:26:24,317
After 30 years?

972
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:26,821
I'm afraid so.

973
01:26:33,493 --> 01:26:34,896
This...

974
01:26:35,029 --> 01:26:36,664
this doesn't make sense, boss.

975
01:26:36,798 --> 01:26:37,799
Come on, man.

976
01:26:38,966 --> 01:26:40,400
Let's not prolong this.

977
01:26:42,136 --> 01:26:43,336
The door's over there.

978
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:46,841
Or do you need directions?

979
01:27:12,365 --> 01:27:13,768
First day on the job?

980
01:27:13,901 --> 01:27:14,902
Yeah.

981
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:28,248
You...

982
01:27:29,751 --> 01:27:31,986
you hired those guys
to kill me.

983
01:27:33,855 --> 01:27:35,288
Did you know about this?

984
01:27:35,422 --> 01:27:36,991
Look.

985
01:27:37,125 --> 01:27:40,427
You just walk away, all right?
There'll be no repercussions.

986
01:27:40,561 --> 01:27:42,096
I like repercussions.

987
01:27:42,697 --> 01:27:43,798
Open your safe.

988
01:27:43,931 --> 01:27:45,600
There's no winning
here for you.

989
01:27:45,733 --> 01:27:48,268
Open your fucking safe!

990
01:27:49,237 --> 01:27:50,470
You're fucking crazy.

991
01:27:50,605 --> 01:27:51,572
Hey!

992
01:27:51,706 --> 01:27:52,807
-No!
-Hey!

993
01:27:54,075 --> 01:27:55,408
Don't kill him!
Don't kill him!

994
01:27:55,543 --> 01:27:56,811
Don't kill him, all right?

995
01:27:56,944 --> 01:27:58,411
I'm opening the safe.

996
01:28:05,253 --> 01:28:06,254
Back up.

997
01:28:10,323 --> 01:28:12,627
Fill the bag up...
and the guns.

998
01:28:27,474 --> 01:28:30,377
I came in here
to ask you for a favor.

999
01:28:31,813 --> 01:28:33,114
And you get rid of me

1000
01:28:33,247 --> 01:28:36,150
like I'm dogshit on the bottom
of your fucking shoe.

1001
01:28:38,553 --> 01:28:39,520
Come on, man.

1002
01:28:40,922 --> 01:28:41,956
Come on, man.

1003
01:28:43,257 --> 01:28:45,626
Isn't the money enough?
Can't you...

1004
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,028
can't you just walk away?

1005
01:28:56,904 --> 01:28:57,872
Yeah.

1006
01:29:07,181 --> 01:29:08,783
Can you make me a promise?

1007
01:29:11,418 --> 01:29:12,820
The kid stays alive.

1008
01:29:15,323 --> 01:29:16,324
Sit down.

1009
01:29:23,197 --> 01:29:24,198
All right.

1010
01:29:56,364 --> 01:29:58,766
What's the fucking emergency
I had to rush down here

1011
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,368
in the middle
of the night for?

1012
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,570
Like you have anything
better to do.

1013
01:30:02,703 --> 01:30:04,572
I was playing poker.

1014
01:30:04,705 --> 01:30:07,241
I've seen you play cards.
I did you a favor.

1015
01:30:11,746 --> 01:30:13,981
Jesus.
You going on a shooting spree?

1016
01:30:14,115 --> 01:30:15,116
Maybe.

1017
01:30:18,386 --> 01:30:19,452
This is for you.

1018
01:30:21,454 --> 01:30:23,456
You've got my attention.

1019
01:30:23,591 --> 01:30:26,459
Can you get a cashier's cheque
for 70 grand?

1020
01:30:26,594 --> 01:30:27,595
Sure.

1021
01:30:29,964 --> 01:30:32,767
I want you to put
a downpayment on this house.

1022
01:30:33,868 --> 01:30:36,103
Take the check
to my daughter,

1023
01:30:36,237 --> 01:30:39,307
and help her with
the paperwork and tax stuff.

1024
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:45,146
She's a bitch on wheels.
So, watch yourself.

1025
01:30:55,389 --> 01:30:56,390
Are you okay?

1026
01:30:58,458 --> 01:30:59,459
Yeah.

1027
01:31:00,127 --> 01:31:01,128
I'm good.

1028
01:31:03,631 --> 01:31:05,766
Should I ask you
where you got the dough?

1029
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:14,608
It was nice knowing you.

1030
01:31:24,652 --> 01:31:26,187
Come on, come on,
pick up.

1031
01:31:37,131 --> 01:31:38,132
Fuck.

1032
01:31:53,981 --> 01:31:54,982
You home?

1033
01:32:18,507 --> 01:32:19,508
Holy shit.

1034
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:21,175
Hey, buddy.

1035
01:32:25,312 --> 01:32:26,515
What did you...

1036
01:32:26,647 --> 01:32:27,848
What...

1037
01:32:27,982 --> 01:32:30,451
Why the hell would you
do this to yourself?

1038
01:32:31,252 --> 01:32:32,521
Boo boo...

1039
01:32:33,721 --> 01:32:35,589
Come on.

1040
01:32:35,723 --> 01:32:36,791
-Shit.
-Come on.

1041
01:32:37,358 --> 01:32:38,392
Shit.

1042
01:32:39,493 --> 01:32:41,262
Let's get you up.
After three.

1043
01:32:42,396 --> 01:32:43,764
Oh, shit.

1044
01:32:47,468 --> 01:32:48,702
Lay down with me.

1045
01:32:48,836 --> 01:32:49,837
No.

1046
01:32:55,676 --> 01:32:56,677
Ow.

1047
01:33:01,182 --> 01:33:02,183
How do you feel?

1048
01:33:04,718 --> 01:33:06,587
I'm sorry I screwed up.

1049
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:16,130
When I said things
weren't going to end well,

1050
01:33:16,263 --> 01:33:19,033
I knew it would be me
that would fuck things up.

1051
01:33:19,166 --> 01:33:20,267
Mmm.

1052
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:21,996
You need help.

1053
01:34:25,366 --> 01:34:26,834
You're helping me.

1054
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:30,838
I'm serious.

1055
01:34:38,547 --> 01:34:40,047
You are helping me.

1056
01:35:44,044 --> 01:35:46,280
If it ain't my old friend,
Jurassic Park.

1057
01:35:47,515 --> 01:35:48,983
I want to talk some business.

1058
01:35:58,425 --> 01:36:00,394
What's your business?

1059
01:36:00,528 --> 01:36:02,296
I want to buy
one of your girls.

1060
01:36:05,966 --> 01:36:07,134
You fall in love, <i>viejo?</i>

1061
01:36:11,105 --> 01:36:12,473
You going to pimp her out?

1062
01:36:15,142 --> 01:36:17,378
You and me,
we're pieces of shit.

1063
01:36:19,614 --> 01:36:21,181
You're a funny guy.

1064
01:36:21,315 --> 01:36:25,953
We live off pain and weakness.
We're bullies.

1065
01:36:26,086 --> 01:36:28,422
And you think buying a <i>puta</i>
gonna change all that?

1066
01:36:32,459 --> 01:36:33,460
Thirty thousand.

1067
01:36:42,236 --> 01:36:43,203
Not bad.

1068
01:36:48,075 --> 01:36:50,010
Which one do you want?

1069
01:36:50,144 --> 01:36:51,979
The little one
with the curly hair.

1070
01:36:52,112 --> 01:36:53,615
And the blonde bangs.

1071
01:36:58,252 --> 01:36:59,486
She ain't for sale.

1072
01:37:00,321 --> 01:37:02,122
Hey.

1073
01:37:02,256 --> 01:37:04,958
I'm offering you
10,000 above asking price.

1074
01:37:05,092 --> 01:37:06,493
She ain't for sale.

1075
01:37:06,628 --> 01:37:07,629
Why not?

1076
01:37:15,969 --> 01:37:17,104
One of the <i>puteros</i>

1077
01:37:17,237 --> 01:37:18,972
got a little carried away
with her tonight.

1078
01:37:24,845 --> 01:37:26,447
What was her name?

1079
01:37:28,482 --> 01:37:29,517
Araceli.

1080
01:37:30,984 --> 01:37:32,520
What are you gonna do
with her?

1081
01:37:33,854 --> 01:37:35,022
I don't know, man.

1082
01:37:41,763 --> 01:37:43,531
You can't change the world,
<i>viejo.</i>

1083
01:37:43,665 --> 01:37:45,165
World don't
want to be changed.

1084
01:37:52,206 --> 01:37:54,274
I really don't want to
hurt anyone else,

1085
01:37:54,408 --> 01:37:55,710
not even you.

1086
01:37:55,844 --> 01:37:57,911
So, just do what I say, okay?

1087
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:01,181
Come on.

1088
01:38:10,725 --> 01:38:13,260
Come out! Come on, let's go!

1089
01:38:13,394 --> 01:38:14,461
Girls! Come out...

1090
01:38:16,296 --> 01:38:17,431
Wait downstairs.

1091
01:38:22,236 --> 01:38:23,705
Come on.

1092
01:38:23,838 --> 01:38:25,807
Tell your boy
at the front door to go home.

1093
01:38:25,939 --> 01:38:26,907
-Do it!
-Armando,

1094
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,710
you can knock off now.

1095
01:38:28,843 --> 01:38:29,844
You sure?

1096
01:38:29,977 --> 01:38:31,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it covered.

1097
01:38:31,912 --> 01:38:33,046
All right.

1098
01:38:39,052 --> 01:38:40,421
Get the girls out of here.

1099
01:38:43,023 --> 01:38:44,793
Girls, get out here!

1100
01:38:44,925 --> 01:38:47,161
Go wait in the bathroom.

1101
01:38:47,294 --> 01:38:51,766
Come on, in the bathroom!

1102
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:53,434
Johns stay inside.

1103
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,903
Out of the rooms!

1104
01:38:55,035 --> 01:38:56,738
Johns stay inside.

1105
01:38:56,871 --> 01:38:57,906
No rush.

1106
01:38:58,038 --> 01:39:00,441
Hey, you! Inside! Inside!

1107
01:39:09,349 --> 01:39:11,385
Which way do you want me to go?

1108
01:39:11,519 --> 01:39:13,120
The kitchen!

1109
01:39:13,253 --> 01:39:14,221
Come on, girls.

1110
01:39:14,354 --> 01:39:15,322
The kitchen!

1111
01:39:16,423 --> 01:39:17,424
You, sit down.

1112
01:39:19,794 --> 01:39:20,795
You, go!

1113
01:39:23,363 --> 01:39:26,166
<i>Dinero,</i> inside.
Bring... bring in here.

1114
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:29,804
Come on.

1115
01:39:29,938 --> 01:39:31,305
Attagirl.

1116
01:39:31,438 --> 01:39:32,406
You're free.

1117
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:33,741
Go! Go!

1118
01:39:35,976 --> 01:39:36,977
Pay them.

1119
01:39:39,614 --> 01:39:40,615
Easy, easy...

1120
01:39:51,626 --> 01:39:52,694
He has a gun!

1121
01:39:57,064 --> 01:39:58,031
No!

1122
01:40:01,034 --> 01:40:03,671
Yeah, that's Sureno style
right there, bitch.

1123
01:40:07,441 --> 01:40:09,343
You're bleeding out good,
<i>viejo.</i>

1124
01:40:10,377 --> 01:40:11,679
I can finish it off.

1125
01:40:13,146 --> 01:40:14,849
You want me
to make it quick?

1126
01:40:16,450 --> 01:40:18,987
After you, fuckpig.

1127
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:32,199
Just go. Go.

1128
01:40:55,890 --> 01:40:57,692
Don't wake up your mom.

1129
01:40:58,893 --> 01:40:59,894
You hear me?

1130
01:41:16,076 --> 01:41:17,411
Don't come any closer.

1131
01:41:19,313 --> 01:41:20,682
Are you okay?

1132
01:41:20,815 --> 01:41:21,916
Yeah, I'm fine.

1133
01:41:23,017 --> 01:41:24,217
Listen to me, Dre.

1134
01:41:26,153 --> 01:41:28,455
You're gonna hear
some bad stuff about me

1135
01:41:28,590 --> 01:41:30,058
in the next few days.

1136
01:41:33,828 --> 01:41:37,932
Maybe the only way for me
to do something right...

1137
01:41:38,066 --> 01:41:39,867
is by doing something bad.

1138
01:41:42,502 --> 01:41:44,471
I... I don't get it.

1139
01:41:46,841 --> 01:41:49,777
It might not make any sense
to you now, but...

1140
01:41:58,886 --> 01:41:59,887
I tried.

1141
01:42:02,090 --> 01:42:03,091
I tried.

1142
01:42:04,291 --> 01:42:05,459
Go back inside.

1143
01:42:06,326 --> 01:42:08,495
I... I'll be fine. Go on.

1144
01:42:08,630 --> 01:42:09,831
Go on. Go on.

1145
01:43:26,974 --> 01:43:27,975
Hello?

1146
01:43:52,332 --> 01:43:53,333
Hello?

1147
01:43:55,002 --> 01:43:56,369
Anybody here?
