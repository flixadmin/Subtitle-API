1
00:02:57,114 --> 00:03:01,114
Thank you. Hi. I'd like to
go to the Adelphi Hotel.

2
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,559
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry. This is my cab.

3
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,856
I was here first!

4
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,418
Oh, God.

5
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,988
Taxi!

6
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,939
Taxi!

7
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,156
Let's go across. Come on.

8
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,460
We'll get one down the road. Hurry.

9
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,676
For God's sake, Harold,
can we please just get a taxi?

10
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:30,688
I'm trying to get a...

11
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,615
Taxi!

12
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,590
We're going the wrong way!

13
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,467
Put that away. We'll look like tourists.

14
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,599
Hi, honey.

15
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,941
We'll never get a cab.
Let's cut over to Seventh.

16
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,855
- Seventh is that way.
- I know where we are!

17
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,855
Hey, mister. Give me a dollar.

18
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,081
- Come on.
- How about it? One dollar.

19
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,167
Are you deaf? You don't speak English?

20
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,543
Come on. Come on! Up here.

21
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,434
Hey, lady,

22
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,930
do the kid a favor. Don't scream.

23
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,000
Hey, all right.

24
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,380
American Express card.

25
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:49,214
"Don't leave home without it."

26
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,199
Get out of here.

27
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,749
Let's beat it, man.
I don't like it up here.

28
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,645
What, are you scared of heights?

29
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,495
I don't know.
After what happened to Johnny Gobs...

30
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,940
Look, man, Johnny Gobs got ripped
and took a walk off a roof. No big loss.

31
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,816
No, man, that ain't what I heard at all.

32
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:14,832
I heard that the Bat got him.

33
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:18,127
The Bat? Oh, man.
Give me a break, will you?

34
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:22,059
Five stories. Straight down.
There wasn't no blood in the body.

35
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,457
No shit. It was all over the pavement.

36
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:32,366
- I'm getting out of here, man.
- Shut up, man. Listen to me.

37
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,746
There ain't no Bat.

38
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,324
You shouldn't have turned the gun
on that kid, man. You shouldn't have-

39
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:39,458
Hey!

40
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,837
You want your cut of this money or not?
Now shut up!

41
00:05:42,862 --> 00:05:44,767
Shut up.

42
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:29,948
Don't kill me!

43
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,486
Don't kill me, man!

44
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,125
Don't kill me! Don't kill me, man!

45
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,870
I'm not going to kill you.
I want you to do me a favor.

46
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,908
I want you to tell all your friends
about me.

47
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,234
What are you?

48
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm Batman.

49
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:09,642
Across this nation, the words "Gotham City"
are synonymous with crime.

50
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:14,493
Our streets are overrun,
our public officials are helpless.

51
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:18,545
As mayor, I promise to root out
the source of this corruption,

52
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,580
Boss Carl Grissom.

53
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:25,940
Now, our new District Attorney,
Harvey Dent will carry out that promise.

54
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,274
Harvey

55
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,766
Thank you.

56
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,977
Thank you, Mayor Borg. Thank you.

57
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,242
People of Gotham City,

58
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,060
I'm a man of few words.

59
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,690
But those words will count,
and so will my actions.

60
00:07:48,115 --> 00:07:52,705
Police Commissioner Gordon has informed me
that he has targeted those businesses

61
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,086
suspected of fronting for the syndicate
in this city.

62
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:03,275
Before the week is out,
we are going to knock down their doors

63
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,620
and shed the light of the law
on that nest of vipers.

64
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,555
Together, we can make this city
safe for decent people.

65
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,328
Decent people shouldn't live here.

66
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,219
They'd be happier someplace else.

67
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,930
Pretty tough talk about Carl.

68
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,274
Don't worry about it.

69
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,349
If this clown could touch Grissom,
I'd have handed him his lungs by now.

70
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:39,828
If Grissom knew about us...
he might hand you something.

71
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,195
Don't flatter yourself, angel.

72
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,351
He's a tired old man.
He can't run this city without me.

73
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,836
And besides...

74
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,800
he doesn't know.

75
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,879
You don't worry about anything,
do you, Jack?

76
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,492
You look fine.

77
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,610
I didn't ask.

78
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,984
- Yeah, yeah. Hanging on.
- Coming through.

79
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,997
No. Let me guess.

80
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,800
Giant, menacing, supernatural form.
Kind of like a bat.

81
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,560
Yeah, that's it.
What are they seeing up there?

82
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,955
They're drinking Drano.

83
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,460
It's a little weird, Lieutenant.

84
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,062
Thanks for the tip, Dwayne.

85
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,597
Christ. Knox.

86
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,860
Hello, Lt. Eckhardt,
I hear we just had us another Bat attack.

87
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:02,692
That's what, eight sightings now
in just under a month?

88
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:05,017
I hear the Commissioner's
even opened a file. True?

89
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:08,430
Sorry, Knox.
These two slipped on a banana peel.

90
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:12,754
I'm telling you, man, a giant bat!

91
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,562
Sure, he is. Keep moving.

92
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,895
Don't be writing this stuff
in the newspaper, Knox.

93
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,288
It'll ruin your already useless reputation.

94
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,472
Lieutenant, every punk in this town
is scared stiff.

95
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,499
Do you know what they say?
They say he can't be killed.

96
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,820
They say he drinks blood. They say-

97
00:10:29,844 --> 00:10:33,011
I say you're full of shit, Knox.

98
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,150
You can quote me on that.

99
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:42,513
Lieutenant,
is there a 6-foot bat in Gotham City?

100
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,740
And if so, is he on the police payroll?

101
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,574
And if so, what's he pulling down,
after taxes?

102
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,933
Brought you a little snack, Eckhardt.

103
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:24,168
- Why don't you broadcast it?
- Shut up and listen.

104
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:29,425
Harvey Dent has been sniffing around
one of our front companies.

105
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,644
That's my territory.
If there's a problem, I deal with it.

106
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,691
Your problems are our problems.

107
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,488
I answer to Grissom, not to psychos.

108
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,902
Why, Eckhardt,
you ought to think about the future.

109
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,959
You mean when you run the show?
You ain't got no future, Jack.

110
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:53,310
You're an A-1 nut-boy,
and Grissom knows it.

111
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,883
Better be sure.

112
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:07,858
See?

113
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,318
You can make a good decision when you try.

114
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,970
Where you been spending your nights?

115
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,293
I don't care how deeply in debt
this festival is, I want a parade.

116
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,670
I want hot dogs, balloons,
the whole schemer.

117
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:37,382
We're gonna celebrate this
200th anniversary proudly and publicly.

118
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:39,609
We may be celebrating in bankruptcy court.

119
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:43,310
This festival's $250,000 in the red
and we haven't seen one balloon.

120
00:12:43,335 --> 00:12:47,075
You fill this square with people,
and the businesses will come back here.

121
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,140
I think a lot of people might
stay away, Mayor. They're scared.

122
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,280
They won't be scared
when you get Grissom in that courthouse.

123
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,695
I promised that, remember?

124
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:03,263
Welcome, Count Dracula.
Had any sightings of Bigfoot lately?

125
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:06,185
Hey, Knox, they buried your story
on the Batman.

126
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:07,760
That's what they do to garbage.

127
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,946
This is Pulitzer Prize stuff, guys.

128
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:12,301
Hey, Knox. Knox! I got something for you.

129
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:18,931
Very funny. You should have a little
bit more gore under the fangs, though.

130
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,690
What a dick.

131
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,770
Hello, legs.

132
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,103
I'm reading your stuff.

133
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,993
Well, I'm reading yours.

134
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,706
Hi, I'm Vicki Vale.

135
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,901
Vicki Vale. Yeah, photographer.
Vogue, Cosmo. Yeah.

136
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,161
Listen, if you want me to pose nude,
you're gonna need a long lens.

137
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,826
Actually, I was in the Corto Maltese.

138
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,590
A girl could get hurt doing this stuff.

139
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,293
So, what brings you here?

140
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:53,735
I'm here to see some of the wildlife
in Gotham City.

141
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,887
Wildlife?

142
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:56,457
Like what?

143
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,091
Like... bats.

144
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,595
- Who sent you?
- Nobody, really.

145
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,770
I just loved your story, and...

146
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
I like bats.

147
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,248
Really?

148
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:15,965
My pictures, your words.
Pulitzer Prize material. Just think.

149
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,575
Okay, you're a visionary.
You're also the only one who believes me.

150
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,570
I need something tangible.

151
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,450
Gordon's got a file on this.
I can't even get him on the phone.

152
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,618
Bruce Wayne's benefit.
He'll be there, right?

153
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,309
Yeah. I don't seem to be on the guest list.

154
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:32,411
No... No.

155
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:35,528
Yes. Yes.

156
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,884
- Vale, will you marry me?
- No.

157
00:14:37,907 --> 00:14:40,212
- Will you buy me lunch?
- Maybe.

158
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,692
I eat light.

159
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,098
Say this...

160
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,347
...son of a bitch...

161
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:56,329
...makes a connection with us
and with Axis Chemicals.

162
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,817
What kind of damage are we looking at?

163
00:14:58,842 --> 00:15:02,395
If he ties us in with Axis Chemicals,
we're dead and buried.

164
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,692
We should move immediately.

165
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:09,750
I say we break into the place,
trash the office...

166
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:14,494
...and make off with the records
and say it was industrial espionage.

167
00:15:14,856 --> 00:15:16,309
Jack...

168
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,489
Smart thinking. That's the way to go.
In fact...

169
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:24,011
I'd like you to handle this operation
personally.

170
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,940
Me?

171
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:34,931
Hello, sweetheart.

172
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,822
I wonder if you'd mind
waiting in the next room?

173
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,234
That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.
Thank you, gentlemen That's all.

174
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,640
Carl...

175
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,472
can we get somebody else to do this?

176
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,440
The fumes in that place...

177
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:15,782
Jack.

178
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,428
It's an important job.
I need someone I can trust.

179
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,342
You are my number one guy.

180
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,069
Now...

181
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,078
don't forget...

182
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,170
...your lucky deck.

183
00:16:48,534 --> 00:16:53,676
My friend... your luck is about to change.

184
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,150
Police Department.

185
00:16:59,411 --> 00:17:01,791
Get me Lt. Eckhardt.

186
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,808
Can I help you, sir?

187
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,675
Thanks. Thank you very much.
That's very nice of you.

188
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,370
Here you go.

189
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,470
- Good evening, ma'am.
- A little crowded.

190
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,259
Excuse me. Excuse me.

191
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:14,406
Excuse me.

192
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,635
Could you tell me which of these guys
is Bruce Wayne?

193
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,601
I'm not sure.

194
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,490
Thanks, anyway.

195
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,252
Yeah

196
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:25,706
Thank you.

197
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,861
Oh, certainly. Yeah.

198
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:59,416
Eight. I can make that eight.

199
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:02,375
- I can make that eight.
- Place your bets, please.

200
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,428
Commissioner!

201
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:04,910
Mrs. Gordon, you look lovely.

202
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,690
How about that rumor that
Commissioner's got a file on the Batman?

203
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,780
That's not true, is it?

204
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,845
Knox, for the ninth time, there is no Bat.

205
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,918
If there were, we would find him,
we would arrest him.

206
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,254
Would you confirm him?
Be straight with me, Commissioner.

207
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,491
- Commissioner, how you making out?
- Not good at all.

208
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,543
Mr. Dent, I love that tie.

209
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,495
Gordo and I were just discussing
the pros and cons of winged vigilantes.

210
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,597
What's your stand?

211
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:26,172
Mr. Knox, we have enough problems
in this city

212
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,890
without worrying about ghosts and goblins.

213
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,340
Pardon me, but that's not a denial.

214
00:19:33,729 --> 00:19:35,609
Excuse me, dear. I'll be back.

215
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,514
Isn't anybody going to go on record?

216
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,261
- Your Honor, great suit.
- No comment.

217
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,297
Robert, what's up?

218
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:46,840
Anonymous tip.
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

219
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,905
Why wasn't I told about this?
Who's in charge?

220
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,191
- Eckhardt, sir.
- Oh, my God!

221
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:01,300
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

222
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,340
Commissioner Gordon?

223
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:09,402
Vale, I think he went in this room.

224
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,840
Commissioner Gordon?

225
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:27,535
Wait, wait.
Living room, dining room, arsenal.

226
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:29,788
Look at this stuff.

227
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,590
Who is this guy?

228
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:37,015
He gives to all these humanitarian causes,
and then collects all this stuff.

229
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:41,406
He probably does it to get chicks.
They like him for his big charity balls.

230
00:20:41,582 --> 00:20:44,219
Don't leave out his very large bankroll.

231
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,954
Now, remember, the more they've got,
the less they're worth.

232
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,865
Then this guy must be
the most worthless guy in America.

233
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,355
Check this out. He must have been
King of the Wicker People.

234
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,540
Where'd this come from?

235
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,652
I have no idea.

236
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,933
It's Japanese.

237
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,650
How do you know?

238
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,685
Because I bought it in Japan.

239
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,184
- Who are you?
- Oh, sorry. Bruce Wayne.

240
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,152
Alexander Knox.

241
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,625
Hi.

242
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,071
Oh, I read your work. I like it.
I like it a lot.

243
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,862
Thanks. Can I have a grant?

244
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:22,983
Vicki Vale.

245
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,726
Hi. Bruce Wayne.

246
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,308
Are you sure?

247
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,180
Yeah, this time.

248
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:31,652
I've seen your photographs
from Corto Maltese, haven't I?

249
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,457
Right.

250
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,521
You've got a wonderful eye.

251
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:37,556
Some people think she has two.

252
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:41,518
This is an amazing house.
I'd like to shoot it sometime if you...

253
00:21:41,543 --> 00:21:42,699
Mr. Wayne.

254
00:21:42,724 --> 00:21:45,720
We need to open a few more cases
of the champagne. Will that be all right?

255
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:47,474
Oh, sure. Go ahead.

256
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,518
Open, what, six?

257
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:51,494
- Six?
- Yeah.

258
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,425
- Six is good.
- Okay.

259
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:56,198
Yeah. That's great, six, thanks.

260
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,027
Anyway, you gonna be staying in Gotham
for a while?

261
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,824
I... I'd love to.
I'm intrigued by Alex's giant bat stories.

262
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:06,756
Oh, right. The Batman.

263
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,652
That's a little bit light
after the war in Corto Maltese, isn't it?

264
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,542
- And what do you do for a living?
- Well, I'm involved-

265
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:18,010
Sir, Commissioner Gordon
was compelled to leave.

266
00:22:18,035 --> 00:22:19,325
Okay, thank you.

267
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,675
Very unexpectedly, sir.

268
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:25,163
Will you two excuse me?

269
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,489
I... I think perhaps this way, sir.

270
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:28,910
Oh, right.

271
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:31,144
Alfred, they need some more wine
in the front room

272
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,949
and someone named Mrs. Daley
needs a copy of the menu.

273
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:37,004
Oh, and... give Knox a grant.

274
00:22:42,144 --> 00:22:44,425
Nice talking with you, Wayne.

275
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:45,966
The rich...

276
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:49,579
You know why they're so odd?
Because they can afford to be.

277
00:22:49,604 --> 00:22:51,233
I mean, look at this mirror.

278
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,260
Maybe it should be Bruce Vain.

279
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,656
Robert, what's up?

280
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,040
Anonymous tip.

281
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,340
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

282
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,746
Good Lord. If we could put our hands
on him, we'd have Grissom.

283
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,380
Why wasn't I told about this?
Who's in charge?

284
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,980
- Eckhardt, sir.
- Oh, my God!

285
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:48,777
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

286
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,440
All right. Take a good look.
This is the guy.

287
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,972
All right, get a good look.

288
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,808
Shoot to kill. You know what I mean?

289
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,880
All right, let's move out.

290
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,183
We've been ratted out here, boys.

291
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:50,027
Watch it.

292
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:57,080
Freeze!

293
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,492
You, left.

294
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:17,457
You take the right. Move it. Move it.

295
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,010
What the hell's going on?

296
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:22,289
Christ. What are you trying to do?
Blow the collar?

297
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:24,957
I'm in charge here, not Carl Grissom.

298
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,144
This is Commissioner Gordon.

299
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:30,629
I want him taken alive.

300
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:35,324
I repeat. Any man who opens fire
on Jack Napier will answer to me.

301
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,546
Let me down!

302
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,314
Let me down!

303
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,845
Let me down!

304
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,832
Oh, my God.

305
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,436
He went that way!

306
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:45,445
See if you can get up on the catwalk
on that side.

307
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,300
You take that side.
Be careful. Be very careful.

308
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:04,357
Jesus!

309
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,525
Let him go, or I'll do Gordon!

310
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:22,876
Nice outfit.

311
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:37,921
Come on, Jack, let's go!

312
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:46,063
Come on!

313
00:28:46,088 --> 00:28:47,163
Come on, Jack!

314
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:48,879
Eckhardt!

315
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,981
Think about the future.

316
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:38,689
God damn it, we had him.

317
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,432
Hold it right there!

318
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,768
Who is this guy?

319
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,533
I don't know.

320
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,850
Until we find out, keep a lid on it.

321
00:30:25,765 --> 00:30:30,395
Wait. If there's no Bat, then who
dropped this guy, Napier, into the acid?

322
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,656
Suicide? Wait,
I want to get this on tape, okay?

323
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:35,164
Hello?

324
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:36,820
He hung up.

325
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,839
Okay, what have you got?

326
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,316
Okay. Here's the inner city,

327
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,690
here's Axis Chemicals
and here's the sightings so far.

328
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:45,535
Maybe Batman has some kind
of flight pattern or something.

329
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,822
That's all I can think of.

330
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:48,390
This is very good. Very good.
I'll tell you what...

331
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:51,175
Tonight, first I'll take you to dinner,
then we'll walk the trail.

332
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:53,828
No can do. I got a date. With Bruce Wayne.

333
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,122
- Wayne! Wayne! Oh, no!
- I knew you were gonna say that.

334
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,610
The guy's a stiff. He's a rich stiff,
but you could do much better.

335
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,726
Thanks for being so concerned. Bye.

336
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:18,125
How's the soup?

337
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,970
Excuse me?

338
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,124
The soup. How is it?

339
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,414
It's great.

340
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,453
Could you pass the salt?

341
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:36,722
Sure.

342
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:43,406
Thanks.

343
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:56,804
Did you have a hard time finding the house?

344
00:31:57,918 --> 00:32:00,921
- No, it was no problem.
- Good.

345
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:07,421
Do you like eating in here?

346
00:32:09,221 --> 00:32:10,499
Oh, yeah.

347
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,070
You want to know the truth, I don't think
I've ever been in this room before.

348
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:23,249
Do you want to get out of here?

349
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:24,218
Yes.

350
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:38,315
There was young Master Bruce, leading
his gray pony with me on its back,

351
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:42,976
like a sack of old potatoes, covered
in mud and nursing a sprained ankle.

352
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:47,839
That was the first and last time
I gave him a riding lesson.

353
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:52,190
Well, I think I've embarrassed him
for long enough.

354
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,570
I'm off to bed.

355
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:58,612
But please, leave everything.
I'll tidy up in the morning.

356
00:32:58,957 --> 00:33:00,747
- Good night, miss.
- Good night, Alfred.

357
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,942
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Alfred.

358
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:12,185
He's really wonderful.
He loves you a lot.

359
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:15,590
Alfred's great.
I couldn't find my socks without him.

360
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:19,789
He sort of reminds me of my grandfather.

361
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,464
Were you close to him?

362
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:25,689
Yeah, I used to spend summers with him
and my grandmother.

363
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:30,031
They had a house on the lake.
Nothing like this, but...

364
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:32,514
...it was fun.

365
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:35,679
- That sounds nice.
- Yeah.

366
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:39,344
What about your family?

367
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:41,101
Well...

368
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:44,312
Actually, Alfred is my family.

369
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:52,040
This house and all this stuff
really doesn't seem like you at all.

370
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,320
Some of it is very much me.

371
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,510
Some of it isn't.

372
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,720
That dining room is definitely not you.

373
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,593
The dining room isn't.

374
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,671
- Let's see how we did.
- Yeah.

375
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,060
Oh, my God!

376
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:55,692
Mirror.

377
00:34:57,806 --> 00:34:58,801
Mirror!

378
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:12,460
You understand that the nerves
were completely severed, Mr. Napier.

379
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,420
You see what I have to work with here.

380
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:45,458
There's an awful lot of stairs
in this place.

381
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:47,611
My feet are killing me.

382
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,919
Okay.

383
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:59,247
I feel a little drunk.
And you're not anything.

384
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,286
Hey, one drink and I'm flying.

385
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,420
Why are you afraid of flying?

386
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,925
That you, sugar bumps?

387
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,130
Who the hell are you?

388
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:44,760
It's me. "Sugar bumps".

389
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,393
Jack.

390
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,750
Thank God, you're alive!
I heard you'd been...

391
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,850
Fried?

392
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:56,258
Is that what you heard?

393
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:58,690
You set me up over a woman.

394
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:01,764
A woman!

395
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,439
You must be insane.

396
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:20,063
Don't bother.

397
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:23,969
Your life won't be worth spit!

398
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:29,880
I've been dead once already.
It's very liberating.

399
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:33,461
You should think of it as therapy.

400
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:37,602
Jack, listen.

401
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,810
Maybe we can cut a deal.

402
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,230
Jack?

403
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,490
Jack is dead, my friend.

404
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,030
You can call me...

405
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,530
Joker.

406
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,450
And as you can see...

407
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,047
I'm a lot happier.

408
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,078
What a day.

409
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,368
Gotham City.

410
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,760
It always brings a smile to my face.

411
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,508
"Winged freak...

412
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,328
"...terrorizes..."

413
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,422
Wait till they get a load of me.

414
00:39:57,206 --> 00:39:58,308
Hey.

415
00:39:58,524 --> 00:40:00,290
I've got an idea.

416
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:03,278
How about lunch at my place?
I'll show you some photos.

417
00:40:03,288 --> 00:40:04,779
Sure. Okay.

418
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:08,277
Wait a minute.
No, I can't. I can't make it.

419
00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:11,860
Okay, we'll do it later in the day.

420
00:40:11,885 --> 00:40:12,930
Hold on a second.

421
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:16,068
I can't make it then, either.
I've got a very important meeting today.

422
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:18,967
What's wrong?

423
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:21,216
Nothing's wrong.

424
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,631
Really. I've just got to go out of town
on business for a few days.

425
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:28,056
- Okay, we'll do it when you get back.
- All right.

426
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:30,404
I got to go. I'm late.

427
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:34,131
Bye.

428
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:36,826
Bye.

429
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,870
Jesus.

430
00:40:45,474 --> 00:40:46,419
Alfred.

431
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,616
- It's nice to see you again, ma'am.
- Nice to see you, too.

432
00:40:51,935 --> 00:40:54,145
I'll talk to you guys when you get back.

433
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:56,966
Back, Miss Vale?
We're going to be here for quite a while.

434
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,060
Well, bye.

435
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:10,310
Honey...

436
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,873
you'll never believe
what happened to me today.

437
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,447
So, gentlemen, that's how it is.

438
00:41:30,471 --> 00:41:35,310
Until Grissom resurfaces...
I'm the acting president.

439
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:41,400
And I say, starting with this anniversary
festival, we run this city into the ground.

440
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,672
Why don't we hear this from Grissom?

441
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,052
Yeah.

442
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:48,045
And what's with that stupid grin?

443
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,560
Life's been good to me.

444
00:41:55,784 --> 00:41:57,724
What if we say "no"?

445
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:01,381
Well, Tony...

446
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,545
nobody wants a war.

447
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:10,449
If we can't do business,
we'll just shake hands and that'll be it.

448
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,443
Yeah?

449
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:12,490
Yeah.

450
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:23,412
Oh, I got a live one here.

451
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:35,732
♪ There'll be a hot time
In the old town tonight ♪

452
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:55,380
Antoine got a little hot under the collar.

453
00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:58,724
You're crazy.

454
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:04,544
Haven't you ever heard of
the healing power of laughter?

455
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:13,501
Now get out of here!

456
00:43:13,526 --> 00:43:15,693
You heard him. Let's go! Move it!

457
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,091
You think it over.

458
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,247
Let's go.

459
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:22,544
Come on. Get out of here.

460
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,989
Move it!

461
00:43:32,863 --> 00:43:34,138
Bob.

462
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:40,205
I want you to go down to the Globe, follow
that reporter Knox. Take your camera.

463
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:43,442
See what he knows about this Batman.

464
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,169
And, Bob...

465
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:57,294
remember... you are my number one guy.

466
00:43:59,056 --> 00:44:00,450
Yes, sir.

467
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:16,903
Your pals...

468
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:20,083
they're not bad people.

469
00:44:20,953 --> 00:44:27,081
Maybe we... ought to give them
a couple of days to think it over.

470
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,896
No?

471
00:44:34,383 --> 00:44:35,841
Grease them now?

472
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,264
Okay.

473
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:45,341
You are a vicious bastard, Rotelli.

474
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:48,661
I'm glad you're dead.

475
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:58,036
I'm glad you're dead.

476
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,435
I'm glad he's dead.

477
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,620
I need that.

478
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,854
I'm losing confidence in you.
I thought we were a team.

479
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:19,932
This wouldn't be a personal issue for you,
would it?

480
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:22,456
I just want you to do your job.

481
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:23,924
I am doing my job.

482
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:25,581
Me, too. I'm protecting my partner.

483
00:45:25,726 --> 00:45:30,135
There's nothing in these files. No photos,
no histories, no nothing. Who is this guy?

484
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:31,659
Who cares?

485
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:36,760
Forget about Bruce Wayne.
I'm on to Batman.

486
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,680
They should be out here any second. I can't
wait to hear the explanation for this one.

487
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:38,567
Here he comes, man.

488
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:42,254
So what's this affidavit you filed?

489
00:47:42,279 --> 00:47:44,234
Grissom gave you all his businesses?

490
00:47:44,504 --> 00:47:47,843
Mr. Grissom asked me, as a personal favor,

491
00:47:47,868 --> 00:47:51,226
to take over the operation of
his businesses until he returns.

492
00:47:51,413 --> 00:47:55,100
That's a pretty big favor.
You two must have been very close.

493
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:56,185
Very close.

494
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,148
Did you do a little time together
as children?

495
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:44,422
Our accountants are looking into it.
We assure you, the affidavit is legitimate.

496
00:48:51,138 --> 00:48:52,753
I smell fresh ink, guys.

497
00:48:52,778 --> 00:48:55,461
Now, you can prove all this?
What am I asking? Of course you can.

498
00:48:55,691 --> 00:48:58,994
We have witnesses. Grissom's signature
is perfectly legitimate.

499
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,691
It is legitimate.

500
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,906
I saw it. I was there.

501
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:05,633
I saw it all.

502
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:11,375
He reached up with his dead hand...
and signed it in his own blood.

503
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,008
And he did it...

504
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:14,633
...with this pen.

505
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,601
Hello, Vinnie. It's your uncle Bingo.

506
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,906
Time to pay the check.

507
00:49:28,051 --> 00:49:32,265
The pen...
is truly mightier than the sword.

508
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:49,729
Get down!

509
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:13,611
Doesn't this gang war dampen the city's
plans for the 200th anniversary festival?

510
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:17,448
The festival opens.
The police are gonna stop these gangsters.

511
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:19,745
Mr. Dent. Mr. Dent,
what do you think about the theory

512
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:23,026
that the mysterious Batman
is a mob enforcer killing these men?

513
00:50:23,065 --> 00:50:24,953
I don't have any comment.

514
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,901
Batman.

515
00:50:32,616 --> 00:50:34,143
Batman.

516
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:39,328
Can somebody tell me
what kind of a world we live in

517
00:50:39,353 --> 00:50:44,667
where a man dressed up as a bat
gets all of my press?

518
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:49,534
This town needs an enema!

519
00:50:55,097 --> 00:50:56,387
Alfred.

520
00:50:56,682 --> 00:50:59,143
May I have a glass of water?

521
00:51:00,496 --> 00:51:02,746
I'm relieved that you're home, sir.

522
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:06,511
Miss Vale telephoned.
She was rather concerned.

523
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:10,276
I feel that there's a certain weight
that lifts when she is here.

524
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:15,167
Alfred... why don't you marry her?

525
00:51:15,826 --> 00:51:19,315
That's not exactly
what I had in mind, sir.

526
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,870
No.

527
00:51:25,419 --> 00:51:27,471
I can't go on with that right now.

528
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:30,167
If not now...

529
00:51:32,634 --> 00:51:33,815
when?

530
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:38,823
I don't know.

531
00:51:42,895 --> 00:51:45,307
I just found out Jack Napier's still alive.

532
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:50,002
He's running Grissom's men.

533
00:51:50,027 --> 00:51:52,276
I need all the information
the police have on him.

534
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:54,471
Yes, sir.

535
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:56,339
Thank you.

536
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,073
Alfred.

537
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:06,370
She is great, isn't she?

538
00:52:06,919 --> 00:52:08,284
Yes, sir.

539
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:21,215
- City room, Knox.
- Hi.

540
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,325
- I want you to check something out for me.
- Shoot.

541
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,815
Find out what's so special about the alley
at Pearl and Phillips Streets.

542
00:52:27,855 --> 00:52:29,029
Pearl and Phillips?

543
00:52:29,054 --> 00:52:30,636
- Yeah.
- You got it.

544
00:52:30,661 --> 00:52:31,573
Okay.

545
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:32,698
Okay, bye.

546
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:42,518
Mr. Wayne.

547
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:09,122
So much to do and so little time.

548
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:10,456
The photos.

549
00:53:12,943 --> 00:53:14,953
Who's that loss?

550
00:53:14,978 --> 00:53:16,108
It's Knox.

551
00:53:16,113 --> 00:53:19,053
Bad tie. No style.

552
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,378
Stop the press!

553
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:25,445
- Who is that?
- That's Vicki Vale.

554
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:28,073
She's the photographer
who's working with Knox.

555
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:29,903
That girl has style.

556
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,268
Jesus marimba!

557
00:53:32,546 --> 00:53:38,070
A lovely beast like that running around
could put steam in a man's strides.

558
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:40,779
She's dating some guy named Wayne.

559
00:53:40,804 --> 00:53:43,003
She's about to trade up.

560
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:45,956
It's hard to stay inside the lines.

561
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:52,667
I'm about...

562
00:53:53,692 --> 00:53:55,651
...to get a new girl, Bobby.

563
00:53:57,279 --> 00:54:00,245
I'm of a mind to make some mooky.

564
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:02,175
Phone book.

565
00:54:02,367 --> 00:54:03,659
Yes, sir.

566
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:08,690
So much to do...

567
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:11,823
...and so little time.

568
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:38,883
Have you shipped a million of those things?

569
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:39,930
Yes, sir.

570
00:54:40,322 --> 00:54:44,664
Ship them all! We're going to
take them out a whole new door!

571
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:50,008
Ten seconds to transmission.

572
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:58,556
Five, four, three, two, one.

573
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:00,564
Cue music.

574
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:04,736
Cue Becky.

575
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:08,982
Good evening.

576
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:11,241
The fashion world was stunned today

577
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:15,407
by the sudden deaths of models
Candy Walker and Amanda Keeler.

578
00:55:15,649 --> 00:55:19,853
Cause of death has been attributed to
a violent allergic reaction,

579
00:55:19,862 --> 00:55:24,355
although authorities have not ruled out
the possibility of drug use.

580
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:25,801
Peter.

581
00:55:25,826 --> 00:55:28,806
And plans continue for
the city's 200th birthday

582
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:31,439
as Mayor Borg announced today
at the unveiling...

583
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:34,224
This just in.

584
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:37,150
Three mysterious deaths at a beauty parlor-

585
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,579
...at a beauty parlor in Gotham
were discovered today.

586
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,236
Barry, what the hell's going on?

587
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:51,056
Becky, this is hardly the...

588
00:55:52,853 --> 00:55:53,884
Becky.

589
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,829
Kill the camera.

590
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,922
This is Rene on the news floor.

591
00:55:57,941 --> 00:56:00,462
Dave, I need some paramedics up here now.

592
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:08,535
New and improved Joker products!

593
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,782
With a new secret ingredient.

594
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,050
Smylex!

595
00:56:13,165 --> 00:56:14,431
What is this?

596
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:19,696
Now, let's go over...
to our blind taste test.

597
00:56:20,384 --> 00:56:22,274
Love that Joker.

598
00:56:22,299 --> 00:56:24,873
- Where's it coming from?
- I don't know.

599
00:56:26,386 --> 00:56:31,248
He don't look happy.
He's been using brand X.

600
00:56:32,945 --> 00:56:39,614
But with new and improved Joker brand,
I get a grin again and again.

601
00:56:41,341 --> 00:56:43,420
That luscious tan,

602
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:45,165
those ruby lips

603
00:56:45,197 --> 00:56:50,255
and hair color so natural,
only your undertaker knows for sure.

604
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,398
I know what you're saying:

605
00:56:53,413 --> 00:56:56,883
"Where can I get these fine, new items?"

606
00:56:56,917 --> 00:57:01,578
Well, that's the gag.
Chances are, you bought them already!

607
00:57:02,339 --> 00:57:04,189
Love that Joker.

608
00:57:04,216 --> 00:57:09,374
So, remember... put on a happy face.

609
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,812
- The information you requested, sir.
- Thank you.

610
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:27,390
"Jack Napier, assault with a deadly weapon,
age 15.

611
00:57:27,415 --> 00:57:29,898
"Results of psychological profile...

612
00:57:30,534 --> 00:57:34,820
"violent mood swings, highly intelligent,
emotionally unstable.

613
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:38,593
"Aptitudes include science, chemistry,
and art."

614
00:57:40,586 --> 00:57:42,093
Chemistry.

615
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:50,054
Alfred, let's go shopping.

616
00:57:50,598 --> 00:57:52,023
Yes, sir.

617
00:57:59,605 --> 00:58:04,789
Six new deaths, with no clues
as to the Joker's deadly weapon.

618
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:08,093
And what is the pattern?

619
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:12,159
Foods, alcohol,
or beauty and hygiene products?

620
00:58:12,451 --> 00:58:16,184
Cologne, mouthwash, underarm deodorant?

621
00:58:16,463 --> 00:58:19,933
Or worse yet, there may be no pattern.

622
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:24,140
The search goes on through
Gotham's shopping nightmare.

623
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:26,507
We are going to have a festival

624
00:58:26,507 --> 00:58:29,478
if I have to get a shotgun
to get people there myself.

625
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,824
Do you hear the words
coming out of my mouth, Dent?

626
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,505
The festival is on!

627
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:37,406
And you find out what this madman
is poisoning us with. And fast.

628
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:38,719
Do you read me?

629
00:58:39,853 --> 00:58:41,543
We're working on it.

630
00:58:41,567 --> 00:58:43,328
I need all the help I can get.

631
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,588
Bruce, hi. It's Vicki.

632
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:52,453
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna be 10 minutes late
to the museum, okay?

633
00:58:52,491 --> 00:58:54,445
I'll see you when I get there. Bye.

634
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:03,312
Sir, a message from Miss Vale.

635
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:06,242
She'll be 10 minutes late
in meeting you at the museum.

636
00:59:06,546 --> 00:59:07,971
Okay, fine, thank you.

637
00:59:07,996 --> 00:59:11,507
Wait a minute, Alfred.
I'm not meeting her today.

638
00:59:23,146 --> 00:59:26,054
Jack, where are you going?

639
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:30,398
Daddy's going to make some art, darling.

640
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,515
Excuse me. Mr. Wayne's table?

641
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:10,054
Yes. He hasn't arrived yet.

642
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,562
- We have a table waiting.
- Right.

643
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:19,812
All right.

644
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:40,210
Miss Vale, this just arrived for you.

645
01:01:43,347 --> 01:01:44,348
Gentlemen!

646
01:01:45,163 --> 01:01:47,048
Let's broaden our minds.

647
01:01:47,072 --> 01:01:48,489
Lawrence.

648
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:10,713
Give him a shave.

649
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,151
Terence, brush.

650
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:09,948
The one-dollar bill.

651
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:15,080
Hold it!

652
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:19,041
I kind of like this one, Bob. Leave it.

653
01:03:33,438 --> 01:03:35,487
You can take that off now, I think.

654
01:03:38,235 --> 01:03:41,971
You're beautiful
in an old-fashioned kind of way.

655
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:45,768
But I'm sure we can make you more today.

656
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:51,080
Is that your portfolio?

657
01:03:52,374 --> 01:03:55,252
I'm meeting someone
who wants to see my work.

658
01:03:58,046 --> 01:03:59,056
Crap.

659
01:03:59,381 --> 01:04:00,416
Crap.

660
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:01,713
Crap.

661
01:04:02,217 --> 01:04:03,299
Crap.

662
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,135
Crap, crap...

663
01:04:07,389 --> 01:04:09,291
Now that's good work.

664
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:15,799
The skulls, the bodies.

665
01:04:15,814 --> 01:04:19,526
You give it such a glow.
I don't know if it's art, but I like it.

666
01:04:21,678 --> 01:04:24,548
Let me tell you what I'm thinking about,
sweetie.

667
01:04:24,573 --> 01:04:26,593
I was in the bath one day

668
01:04:26,618 --> 01:04:30,725
when I realized
why I was destined for greatness.

669
01:04:30,996 --> 01:04:34,252
You know how concerned people are
about appearances.

670
01:04:34,544 --> 01:04:37,394
This is attractive, that is not.

671
01:04:37,419 --> 01:04:42,135
That is all behind me.
I now do what other people only dream.

672
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,332
I make art. Until someone dies.

673
01:04:45,344 --> 01:04:46,273
See?

674
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:52,315
I am the world's first
fully-functioning homicidal artist.

675
01:04:54,561 --> 01:04:55,823
What do you want?

676
01:04:57,564 --> 01:04:59,854
My face on the one-dollar bill.

677
01:05:02,027 --> 01:05:03,596
You must be joking.

678
01:05:04,655 --> 01:05:06,595
Do I look like I'm joking?

679
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:08,307
Well...

680
01:05:08,575 --> 01:05:09,870
Listen.

681
01:05:10,669 --> 01:05:15,182
We mustn't compare ourselves
to regular people. We're artists.

682
01:05:15,207 --> 01:05:18,760
For instance, let me challenge you
with a little piece I did.

683
01:05:18,794 --> 01:05:20,955
Bob. Alicia.

684
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:24,575
You will take pictures and record my work.

685
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:29,213
You will join me in
the avant-garde of the new aesthetic.

686
01:05:29,221 --> 01:05:33,275
Jack, you said I could watch you
improve the paintings.

687
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:36,440
I'm in trouble now.

688
01:05:37,062 --> 01:05:39,190
Why is she wearing a mask?

689
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,088
Well, she's just a sketch, really.

690
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:45,909
Alicia, sit down.
Show the lady why you wear the mask.

691
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:50,205
You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's been made over
in line with my new philosophy.

692
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:52,010
So now, like me...

693
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:54,088
she's a living work of art.

694
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:01,627
I'm no Picasso, but do you like it?

695
01:06:02,588 --> 01:06:03,948
It's great.

696
01:06:04,756 --> 01:06:08,112
So, what can I do for you?

697
01:06:08,685 --> 01:06:11,192
A little song, a little dance.

698
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,862
Batman's head on a lance.

699
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:16,096
Tell me, what do you know about...

700
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:18,268
I don't know anything about Batman.

701
01:06:19,847 --> 01:06:21,870
- Really?
- Yeah.

702
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:24,518
Well, how about a little "you and me"?

703
01:06:27,196 --> 01:06:28,471
You're insane.

704
01:06:28,488 --> 01:06:30,658
I thought I was a Pisces. Come on.

705
01:06:30,709 --> 01:06:33,719
Let's make up. Have a little...

706
01:06:33,744 --> 01:06:35,291
whiff of my posy.

707
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:43,545
Help me!

708
01:06:44,046 --> 01:06:45,385
I'm melting!

709
01:06:45,797 --> 01:06:49,705
I'm melting! Help me! I'm melting!

710
01:06:56,016 --> 01:06:57,245
Boo.

711
01:07:12,407 --> 01:07:13,776
Hold on.

712
01:07:22,835 --> 01:07:25,906
Where does he get those wonderful toys?

713
01:07:28,715 --> 01:07:30,500
- Get in the car.
- Which one?

714
01:08:56,386 --> 01:08:57,562
Let's go.

715
01:09:12,903 --> 01:09:13,972
Shields.

716
01:09:38,846 --> 01:09:40,685
How much do you weigh?

717
01:09:40,848 --> 01:09:42,677
About 108, I think.

718
01:09:51,608 --> 01:09:52,833
Hold on.

719
01:10:03,495 --> 01:10:05,661
See that thing on my belt? Grab it.

720
01:10:05,789 --> 01:10:07,443
Whatever you do, don't let go.

721
01:10:21,972 --> 01:10:23,232
No blood.

722
01:10:23,265 --> 01:10:25,085
Who is this guy?

723
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,396
Check his wallet.

724
01:10:27,603 --> 01:10:28,982
Wait a minute.

725
01:10:29,286 --> 01:10:30,372
What is that?

726
01:10:30,397 --> 01:10:34,318
Some kind of body armor.
He's human after all.

727
01:10:34,568 --> 01:10:36,013
Take off the mask.

728
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:43,130
Shoot her!

729
01:11:46,014 --> 01:11:47,464
Shields open.

730
01:12:12,249 --> 01:12:14,362
You weigh a little more than 108.

731
01:12:14,376 --> 01:12:16,010
- Really?
- Let's go.

732
01:12:20,632 --> 01:12:21,799
Stop.

733
01:12:50,537 --> 01:12:52,190
Where are we going?

734
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:13,276
Be careful.

735
01:14:22,629 --> 01:14:23,659
Bats.

736
01:14:25,007 --> 01:14:26,706
They're great survivors.

737
01:14:51,909 --> 01:14:53,436
What is all this?

738
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:55,128
The police have got it wrong.

739
01:14:55,501 --> 01:14:57,931
They're looking for one product.

740
01:14:57,956 --> 01:15:01,065
The Joker's tainted
hundreds of chemicals at the source.

741
01:15:03,525 --> 01:15:06,081
Then whole shipments of products
would be poisoned.

742
01:15:06,089 --> 01:15:07,917
And we'd all be dead.

743
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,253
No.

744
01:15:10,677 --> 01:15:14,799
The poison only works when components
are mixed. Hairspray won't do it alone.

745
01:15:14,806 --> 01:15:20,026
But hairspray mixed with lipstick and
perfume will be toxic, and untraceable.

746
01:15:21,021 --> 01:15:22,815
How did you figure this out?

747
01:15:28,987 --> 01:15:30,549
Take that to the press.

748
01:15:31,573 --> 01:15:33,612
I might have some trouble with that.

749
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:37,760
A lot of people think
you're as dangerous as the Joker.

750
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:40,854
He's psychotic.

751
01:15:42,167 --> 01:15:44,854
Some people say the same thing about you.

752
01:15:45,879 --> 01:15:47,174
What people?

753
01:15:48,173 --> 01:15:50,924
Well, I mean, let's face it.

754
01:15:51,635 --> 01:15:55,354
You're not exactly normal. Are you?

755
01:15:55,806 --> 01:15:57,760
It's not exactly a normal world, is it?

756
01:15:57,975 --> 01:16:00,198
Why did you bring me here?

757
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:03,167
You could have sent that stuff
to the press yourself.

758
01:16:04,147 --> 01:16:05,495
You're right.

759
01:16:06,692 --> 01:16:08,885
There is something else you have
that I want.

760
01:16:09,528 --> 01:16:10,651
What?

761
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:35,485
He took the film.

762
01:16:38,929 --> 01:16:40,031
Yeah.

763
01:16:40,392 --> 01:16:41,758
Vale, where have you been?

764
01:16:41,783 --> 01:16:44,048
Are you all right?
Do you want me to come on over?

765
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:45,828
No. No, Allie.

766
01:16:46,815 --> 01:16:50,477
Allie, if I bring something to you,
can we make the evening edition?

767
01:16:51,904 --> 01:16:53,742
Just barely. Is it hot?

768
01:16:54,448 --> 01:16:56,703
Yeah, it's real hot.

769
01:16:57,075 --> 01:16:58,266
Yeah, bye.

770
01:16:59,036 --> 01:17:00,625
- Copy!
- Yes, sir?

771
01:17:11,973 --> 01:17:14,735
Avoid the following combinations:

772
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:18,063
Deodorants with baby powder,
hairspray, and lipstick.

773
01:17:18,722 --> 01:17:22,789
Safe products are flying in
as Gotham City goes on a forced fast.

774
01:17:23,352 --> 01:17:26,702
And all of Gotham is wondering
what to make of Batman.

775
01:17:26,727 --> 01:17:29,008
Friend or foe?

776
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:32,485
I have given a name to my pain...

777
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,469
...and it is Batman.

778
01:17:40,244 --> 01:17:43,695
You must possess strength
to inflict pain, Bob.

779
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:50,320
We've got a flying mouse to kill...
and I want to clean my claws.

780
01:17:54,424 --> 01:17:56,735
Sir, Miss Vale called again.

781
01:17:57,427 --> 01:18:02,883
Dare I suggest that your present course of
action might simply strengthen her resolve?

782
01:18:03,475 --> 01:18:05,656
She is quite tenacious.

783
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:08,125
You're right about that.

784
01:18:08,146 --> 01:18:12,664
And if I may say so, quite special. Perhaps
you could try telling her the truth.

785
01:18:23,036 --> 01:18:24,375
Coming.

786
01:18:30,252 --> 01:18:31,195
Hi.

787
01:18:38,385 --> 01:18:39,430
May I come in?

788
01:18:49,688 --> 01:18:51,445
This is a nice apartment.

789
01:18:53,442 --> 01:18:55,078
Lots of space.

790
01:19:00,373 --> 01:19:02,086
Listen, I came over to...

791
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:03,450
...clear a few things-

792
01:19:03,475 --> 01:19:05,313
I don't know who you think you are!

793
01:19:05,746 --> 01:19:06,832
You hurt me.

794
01:19:06,856 --> 01:19:07,649
I know.

795
01:19:07,664 --> 01:19:09,899
- I called you and I called you.
- I know.

796
01:19:09,924 --> 01:19:12,547
And you lied! You lied about leaving town.

797
01:19:12,586 --> 01:19:14,860
- Well, let me tell you why.
- Let me tell you!

798
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:17,536
You invited me out, we went to dinner.
I thought we felt something.

799
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,175
- And I trusted you.
- If you give me a chance to...

800
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,735
I even slept with you.
I can't believe I did that.

801
01:19:20,761 --> 01:19:23,167
And then you wouldn't return my calls.
You must be some kind of...

802
01:19:23,649 --> 01:19:24,406
...jerk.

803
01:19:24,431 --> 01:19:29,664
Look. You're a real nice girl and
I like you a lot, but right now, shut up.

804
01:19:30,729 --> 01:19:32,672
I have something I have to tell you.

805
01:19:40,822 --> 01:19:45,399
You know how people have different sides
to their personality?

806
01:19:46,954 --> 01:19:48,313
Sometimes...

807
01:19:49,414 --> 01:19:53,563
a person will have to actually
lead a different life.

808
01:19:54,002 --> 01:19:55,742
Oh, my God, you're married.

809
01:19:56,296 --> 01:19:57,852
No, I'm not married.

810
01:20:05,264 --> 01:20:06,469
You see...

811
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:10,180
my life is really...

812
01:20:13,397 --> 01:20:14,711
...complex.

813
01:20:17,776 --> 01:20:22,820
All right, listen.
You know how a normal person gets up and...

814
01:20:23,945 --> 01:20:27,711
...goes downstairs
and eats breakfast and...

815
01:20:28,349 --> 01:20:31,758
...kisses somebody good-bye, and goes to...

816
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:35,125
...a job and, you know.

817
01:20:36,251 --> 01:20:37,271
No.

818
01:20:37,296 --> 01:20:38,133
No?

819
01:20:40,924 --> 01:20:42,211
All right, look.

820
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:47,985
Vicki, what I'm trying to tell you is...

821
01:20:49,808 --> 01:20:52,313
Hey, it's okay.

822
01:20:52,352 --> 01:20:53,860
- You can tell me.
- Okay.

823
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:55,689
What?

824
01:20:59,026 --> 01:21:01,000
What I'm trying to tell you is...

825
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:02,438
...is a...

826
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:05,445
I'll be right back.

827
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:07,102
All right.

828
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:18,086
Miss me?

829
01:21:23,509 --> 01:21:27,336
Nice place you got here. Lots of space.

830
01:21:28,305 --> 01:21:31,195
Vicki, we really should have a talk.

831
01:21:31,391 --> 01:21:33,453
I'm very upset.

832
01:21:34,728 --> 01:21:36,610
We were having dinner.

833
01:21:37,481 --> 01:21:40,951
I was a man doing well
with a beautiful woman.

834
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:48,695
And without so much as an apology,
you ran off with that sideshow phony.

835
01:21:53,205 --> 01:21:54,594
You know, Vic...

836
01:21:56,667 --> 01:21:59,524
I've recently had a tragedy in my life.

837
01:21:59,753 --> 01:22:01,039
Alicia...

838
01:22:02,756 --> 01:22:04,813
...threw herself out of the window.

839
01:22:04,838 --> 01:22:05,977
Oh, my God.

840
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:13,711
But... you can't make an omelet
without breaking some eggs.

841
01:22:25,028 --> 01:22:26,998
Well, Miss Vale...

842
01:22:27,489 --> 01:22:29,555
another rooster in the hen-house?

843
01:22:32,744 --> 01:22:35,891
Take thy beak from out my heart.

844
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:40,656
Bruce?

845
01:22:42,379 --> 01:22:45,547
Bruce Wayne, n'est-ce pas?

846
01:22:47,718 --> 01:22:49,078
Most of the time.

847
01:22:55,309 --> 01:22:56,664
I know who you are.

848
01:23:00,063 --> 01:23:02,508
Let me tell you
about this guy I know, Jack.

849
01:23:03,317 --> 01:23:07,195
Mean kid. Bad seed. Hurt people.

850
01:23:07,404 --> 01:23:08,977
I like him already.

851
01:23:12,534 --> 01:23:14,872
You know what the problem was?

852
01:23:15,329 --> 01:23:18,386
He got sloppy. You know, crazy.

853
01:23:18,415 --> 01:23:20,149
He started to lose it.

854
01:23:20,459 --> 01:23:25,211
He had a head full of bad wiring, I guess.
Couldn't keep it straight up here.

855
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:29,302
He was the kind of guy who...

856
01:23:30,427 --> 01:23:34,203
...couldn't hear the train
until it was two feet from him.

857
01:23:38,477 --> 01:23:40,539
You know what happened to this guy, Jack?

858
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,599
Well...

859
01:23:45,609 --> 01:23:47,450
He made mistakes.

860
01:23:49,071 --> 01:23:51,536
Then he ended up with his lights out!

861
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:54,911
Now you want to get nuts?
Come on! Let's get nuts!

862
01:23:56,119 --> 01:23:57,857
Tell me something, my friend.

863
01:23:59,373 --> 01:24:02,130
You ever dance with the devil
in the pale moonlight?

864
01:24:03,085 --> 01:24:04,161
What?

865
01:24:04,294 --> 01:24:07,107
I always ask that of all my prey.

866
01:24:07,673 --> 01:24:09,560
I just like the sound of it.

867
01:24:15,722 --> 01:24:17,901
Never rub another man's rhubarb.

868
01:24:25,274 --> 01:24:29,409
Why is it every time we got company...

869
01:24:30,112 --> 01:24:32,592
...somebody always gets in the way?

870
01:24:32,614 --> 01:24:34,917
I'll need a moment alone, boys.

871
01:24:37,536 --> 01:24:40,870
I'm only laughing on the outside.

872
01:24:41,248 --> 01:24:44,768
My smile is just skin-deep.

873
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:47,284
If you could see inside,

874
01:24:47,504 --> 01:24:49,385
I'm really crying.

875
01:24:50,424 --> 01:24:52,800
You might join me for a weep.

876
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:40,057
You wouldn't believe it.
You really wouldn't.

877
01:25:40,082 --> 01:25:41,245
Well...

878
01:25:41,642 --> 01:25:45,182
While you were out entertaining, I've been
here finding out about your street corner.

879
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,760
Vale

880
01:25:48,941 --> 01:25:51,307
I think your friend Wayne
is really screwed up.

881
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:53,878
More good news.

882
01:25:55,322 --> 01:25:56,518
Here.

883
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:03,471
Oh, my God.

884
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,573
His parents were murdered in that alley.

885
01:26:07,376 --> 01:26:09,214
That's why he went there.

886
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,635
Poor kid watched the whole thing happen
in front of him.

887
01:26:17,135 --> 01:26:19,045
Look at the look on the face.

888
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:21,862
It was the same in front of City Hall.

889
01:26:23,559 --> 01:26:26,165
What do you suppose something like this
does to a kid?

890
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:31,534
Vale...

891
01:26:31,879 --> 01:26:33,596
Don't get personal!

892
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:47,071
Alfred.

893
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:50,180
Did you get the file on my parents?

894
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:52,546
It's on your table, sir.

895
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:54,578
Thank you.

896
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:02,938
What's on your mind, Alfred?

897
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:08,990
I have no wish to fill
my few remaining years

898
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:11,565
grieving for the loss of old friends...

899
01:27:15,652 --> 01:27:17,446
...or their sons.

900
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:40,260
The 200th anniversary birthday gala
has been indefinitely postponed.

901
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:43,347
We simply cannot guarantee public safety-

902
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:44,510
Joker here.

903
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:46,755
We got interference. Call the OB unit.

904
01:27:46,782 --> 01:27:52,868
Now you fellows have said some pretty
mean things, some of which were true,

905
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:55,537
under that fiend, Boss Grissom.

906
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:58,874
He was a thief and a terrorist.

907
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:02,577
On the other hand,
he had a tremendous singing voice.

908
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:06,670
He's dead now, and he's left me in charge.

909
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:14,920
Now, I can be theatrical
and maybe even a little rough.

910
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:17,873
But one thing I am not...

911
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:19,928
...is a killer!

912
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:22,866
I'm an artist.

913
01:28:23,303 --> 01:28:26,156
I love a good party.

914
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:28,064
So, truce.

915
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:32,235
Commence au festival!

916
01:28:32,855 --> 01:28:36,248
And I've got a surprise for Gotham City.

917
01:28:36,942 --> 01:28:42,772
At midnight, I will dump $20 million
in cash on the crowd.

918
01:28:45,993 --> 01:28:48,733
Don't worry about me. I've got enough.

919
01:28:48,745 --> 01:28:51,647
We are not prepared to discuss any deals.

920
01:28:54,209 --> 01:28:56,889
You heard it, folks, $20 million.

921
01:28:57,129 --> 01:28:59,669
And there will be entertainment.

922
01:28:59,693 --> 01:29:05,195
The big dukeroo. With me in one corner,
and in the other corner,

923
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:11,301
the man who has brought real terror
to Gotham City, Batman.

924
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:13,500
Can you hear me?

925
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:15,527
Just the two of us.

926
01:29:15,552 --> 01:29:17,433
Mano y mano.

927
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:21,097
I have taken off my make-up.

928
01:29:22,029 --> 01:29:27,240
Let's see if you can take off yours.

929
01:31:39,124 --> 01:31:40,644
Tell me, kid.

930
01:31:41,543 --> 01:31:46,316
You ever dance with the devil
by the pale moonlight?

931
01:31:54,056 --> 01:31:55,431
Man, let's go!

932
01:31:58,435 --> 01:32:00,063
Let's go, Jack!

933
01:32:03,774 --> 01:32:05,079
See you around, kid.

934
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:26,045
Thanks.

935
01:32:32,052 --> 01:32:33,311
Hi.

936
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:36,905
Tell me if I'm crazy.

937
01:32:39,226 --> 01:32:42,530
But that wasn't just another night
for either of us, was it?

938
01:32:44,398 --> 01:32:49,155
I mean, we both got to each other,
didn't we?

939
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:55,716
Why won't you let me in? Why?

940
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:00,849
You got in.

941
01:33:05,878 --> 01:33:08,013
I've loved you since I met you.

942
01:33:09,105 --> 01:33:12,943
But I don't know what to think of all this.
I really don't.

943
01:33:12,968 --> 01:33:15,708
Look. Sometimes I don't know
what to think about this.

944
01:33:15,721 --> 01:33:17,698
It's just something I have to do.

945
01:33:17,723 --> 01:33:19,373
Why?

946
01:33:19,391 --> 01:33:21,349
Because nobody else can.

947
01:33:24,938 --> 01:33:27,458
I tried to avoid all this, but I can't.

948
01:33:28,025 --> 01:33:29,794
This is how it is.

949
01:33:30,652 --> 01:33:32,302
It's not a perfect world.

950
01:33:32,767 --> 01:33:35,380
It doesn't have to be a perfect world.

951
01:33:39,690 --> 01:33:43,872
I just gotta know,
are we going to try to love each other?

952
01:33:47,044 --> 01:33:48,764
I'd like to.

953
01:33:50,066 --> 01:33:54,403
But he's out there right now.
And I've got to go to work.

954
01:35:36,945 --> 01:35:39,213
Into the air, Junior Birdman!

955
01:35:39,233 --> 01:35:40,449
Missed me!

956
01:35:42,117 --> 01:35:43,986
Yeah! Watch me!

957
01:38:05,427 --> 01:38:07,835
Get them. Take the pictures.

958
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,428
Gotham's greed.

959
01:38:38,978 --> 01:38:42,795
And now, folks...
it's time for, "Who Do You Trust?"

960
01:38:43,715 --> 01:38:46,585
Money, money! Who do you trust?

961
01:38:46,593 --> 01:38:49,366
Me? I'm giving away free money.

962
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:53,467
And where is the Batman?

963
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:57,452
He's at home, washing his tights.

964
01:39:05,670 --> 01:39:10,050
Winged battle flies through the night
and finds me ready.

965
01:39:10,075 --> 01:39:12,108
Bob. Mask.

966
01:39:13,036 --> 01:39:15,225
Masks! Put them on now!

967
01:39:15,588 --> 01:39:17,093
And now...

968
01:39:18,709 --> 01:39:20,420
...comes the part...

969
01:39:20,998 --> 01:39:23,856
...where I relieve you, the little people,

970
01:39:23,881 --> 01:39:28,599
of the burden of your failed 
and useless lives.

971
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:35,090
But, as my plastic surgeon always said, 
"If you got to go, go with a smile."

972
01:40:06,295 --> 01:40:07,316
Oh, my God.

973
01:40:08,050 --> 01:40:09,680
Smylex gas.

974
01:40:10,154 --> 01:40:11,945
He's going to kill everybody!

975
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:14,043
Get in the car. Get in the car!

976
01:40:22,898 --> 01:40:24,395
Hurry!

977
01:42:15,710 --> 01:42:17,114
My balloons.

978
01:42:27,481 --> 01:42:29,146
Those are my balloons.

979
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:58,255
He stole my balloons!

980
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:03,010
Why didn't somebody tell me
he had one of those things?

981
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,020
Bob. Gun.

982
01:43:13,235 --> 01:43:15,552
I'm going to need a minute
or two alone, boys.

983
01:43:16,010 --> 01:43:17,989
Come on, get out of here!

984
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:14,044
Come on, you gruesome son of a bitch.
Come to me.

985
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:52,685
Darling.

986
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:57,536
I've got to get you to the church on time.

987
01:46:01,690 --> 01:46:03,192
Yes, sir?

988
01:46:03,488 --> 01:46:07,118
Gotham City Cathedral.
Transportation for two.

989
01:46:07,152 --> 01:46:08,802
- Right away, sir? 
- Five minutes.

990
01:46:08,827 --> 01:46:09,911
Five minutes.

991
01:46:14,917 --> 01:46:17,810
- Better make it 10. 
- Okay, 10 minutes.

992
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:20,365
All right, let's go, men, let's go.

993
01:48:52,950 --> 01:48:54,266
You men, go that way.

994
01:48:54,284 --> 01:48:55,914
Rest of you, follow me. Follow me.

995
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:49,590
Let's go.

996
01:49:57,257 --> 01:50:00,777
Point those searchlights up at the tower,
right now! Move! Move!

997
01:50:31,006 --> 01:50:34,972
It can be truly said that
I have a bat in my belfry.

998
01:50:43,936 --> 01:50:45,167
Shall we dance?

999
01:52:07,512 --> 01:52:13,502
You know, without you...
I just wouldn't want to go on.

1000
01:53:37,025 --> 01:53:39,875
It's as though we were made for each other.

1001
01:53:39,903 --> 01:53:42,048
Beauty and the Beast.

1002
01:53:43,031 --> 01:53:48,370
Of course, if anyone else calls you 
"beast", I'll rip their lungs out.

1003
01:54:19,067 --> 01:54:20,790
Mr. Joker?

1004
01:54:24,239 --> 01:54:26,993
You say such beautiful things.

1005
01:54:28,445 --> 01:54:31,759
And you're so powerful. And purple!

1006
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:35,227
I love purple.

1007
01:54:37,836 --> 01:54:39,071
Excuse me.

1008
01:54:39,421 --> 01:54:41,915
Have you ever danced with the devil
in the pale moonlight?

1009
01:54:46,428 --> 01:54:47,876
I'm going to kill you.

1010
01:54:48,551 --> 01:54:50,685
You idiot!

1011
01:54:50,710 --> 01:54:53,010
You made me, remember?

1012
01:54:53,018 --> 01:54:55,188
You dropped me into
that vat of chemicals!

1013
01:54:55,213 --> 01:54:59,713
That wasn't easy to get over!
And don't think that I didn't try.

1014
01:54:59,733 --> 01:55:01,071
I know you did.

1015
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:30,639
You killed my parents.

1016
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:32,001
What?

1017
01:55:33,815 --> 01:55:35,243
What are you talking about?

1018
01:55:35,686 --> 01:55:38,476
I made you, you made me first.

1019
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:41,450
Hey, bat-brain,
I was a kid when I killed your parents.

1020
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:44,390
When I say I made you,
you gotta say you made me.

1021
01:55:44,420 --> 01:55:46,290
How childish can you get?

1022
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:49,696
You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses on,
would you?

1023
01:56:05,830 --> 01:56:07,639
What are you laughing at?

1024
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:16,983
Here, let me lend you a hand.

1025
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:26,475
Lend you a hand.

1026
01:56:33,945 --> 01:56:36,997
Oh, they don't make them like they used to!

1027
01:56:40,542 --> 01:56:42,212
Hey, Batsy!

1028
01:56:55,641 --> 01:56:58,954
There he is! Down there! Go down!

1029
01:57:11,573 --> 01:57:13,165
It's time to retire.

1030
01:57:14,493 --> 01:57:16,743
Feel free to drop in.

1031
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:28,962
Sometimes I just kill myself!

1032
01:57:32,569 --> 01:57:34,029
Come on.

1033
01:57:34,054 --> 01:57:35,259
Hold on!

1034
01:59:46,430 --> 01:59:50,773
Our police have rounded up
all the Joker's men.

1035
01:59:51,066 --> 01:59:53,456
The reign of crime is over.

1036
01:59:53,902 --> 01:59:57,662
Public safety in Gotham City
is no longer a laughing matter.

1037
01:59:57,680 --> 02:00:00,150
Hey, Vale.
Aren't you covering this press conference?

1038
02:00:00,180 --> 02:00:01,280
No.

1039
02:00:01,285 --> 02:00:03,258
What about our Pulitzer Prize?

1040
02:00:03,829 --> 02:00:05,539
What about us?

1041
02:00:06,206 --> 02:00:08,211
What about your picture of Batman?

1042
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,328
Take care, Allie.

1043
02:00:20,929 --> 02:00:23,680
We've received a letter from Batman
this morning.

1044
02:00:25,718 --> 02:00:28,353
"Please inform the citizens of Gotham

1045
02:00:28,378 --> 02:00:31,508
"that Gotham City's
earned a rest from crime.

1046
02:00:32,117 --> 02:00:35,787
"But if the forces of evil 
should rise again,

1047
02:00:35,812 --> 02:00:39,075
"to cast a shadow
on the heart of the city...

1048
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:40,422
"call me."

1049
02:00:40,699 --> 02:00:43,844
Question. How do we call him?

1050
02:00:48,610 --> 02:00:50,461
He gave us a signal.

1051
02:01:26,030 --> 02:01:29,097
I thought champagne would be in order,
ma'am.

1052
02:01:29,122 --> 02:01:30,687
Hi, Alfred.

1053
02:01:39,750 --> 02:01:43,476
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you
that he might be a little late.

1054
02:01:46,590 --> 02:01:48,788
I'm not a bit surprised.
