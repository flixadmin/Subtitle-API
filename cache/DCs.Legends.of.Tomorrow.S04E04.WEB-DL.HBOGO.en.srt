1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,640
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,920
Mallus wasn't the only
prisoner to escape.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,720
Now there's magic.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,280
An unknown number of other
dangerous magical beings

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,360
got spat out across the timeline
and now must be sent to hell.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,760
<i>She's a shapeshifter.</i>

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,160
- What did you do to me?
- Lobotomy of sorts.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,000
Your shapeshifting days
are over, sweetheart.

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,160
- No!
- She definitely isn't Amaya.

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,600
Did you just hear that?

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,280
Judy, relax.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,000
There's nothing out here.

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,160
Tonight it's just you and me, okay?

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Wait a second.

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,520
Don't tell me that the
fearless Ms. Lance

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,320
is scared of a little horror film.

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,760
No, I love horror movies,

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,680
and I watched them obsessively
as a kid,

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,120
so how could I have missed
this gem?

20
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,120
"Swamp Thaaaang."

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,160
Never heard of it.
And what's with all the As?

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,080
Okay, let me look.

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,080
Okay, "Swamp Thaaaang."

24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,280
Apparently there are four As
in the name

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,280
because it's the fourth film
in the franchise.

26
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,800
The A.V. Club gave it
a D-plus, saying,

27
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,840
"The production design is as
lazy as the action staging."

28
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,480
- Harsh.
- Yeah.

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,480
"Based on real-life tragic
events that occurred

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,440
at Camp Ogawa, Maine,
in the summer of 1995"?

31
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,960
Gideon.

32
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,400
We're in my room, babe.

33
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
Right.

34
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,920
Speak of the devil.

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,880
<i>Sorry to interrupt, Captain,
but I've detected</i>

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,800
<i>new magical events
in the timeline.</i>

37
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,560
<i>It seems that a number
of children</i>

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
<i>went missing
from a summer camp...</i>

39
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,880
Let me guess.
Camp Ogawa, Maine.

40
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
<i>Precisely.</i>

41
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,960
Looks like the handiwork
of one of our fugitives.

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,120
<i>Shall I plot a course to 1995, then?</i>

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,680
And while you're at it,
fabricate a mess of bug spray.

44
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
I'm on my way.

45
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,280
Well, how about that?
We almost got to spend

46
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,360
two whole uninterrupted hours
together.

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,640
How about...

48
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,440
you come with me?

49
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,600
Summer camp?

50
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,680
As in bug bites, bunk beds,
and mean girls?

51
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,200
No, summer camp, as in camp fires,

52
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,800
sing-alongs,
and friendship bracelets.

53
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,640
Camp's the best.
You'll love it. Pinkie swear.

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,640
What are you doing?

55
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,320
It's something you do when
you're a kid. It's like a promise.

56
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
What?

57
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,080
Come on. No, pinkie.

58
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,080
- Yes!
- Weird.

59
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,760
This will be a great way for us
to spend some more time together,

60
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,120
and, plus, we get to make sure
that doesn't happen in real life.

61
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,600
I talked to Nate, and he's got
things covered at the Bureau.

62
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,000
He and Gary have their hands full

63
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,400
with all the magical creatures
popping up.

64
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,560
Nate and Gary are in charge.

65
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,640
{\an5}Well, anyways,
I'm glad that he's there

66
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,680
{\an5}because we've got something
I really don't want him to see.

67
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
What's that?

68
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,240
Amaya.

69
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,360
It just looks like her.

70
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,920
- Did you say "it"?
- She's a shapeshifter.

71
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,640
We found her in London, 1977.

72
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
Hello.

73
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,480
- Not much of a talker, I see.
- Oh, she talks.

74
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,920
- Go to hell!
- Just her way of saying "hello."

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,720
Oh, let me out of here, you bastards!

76
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,440
She's still adjusting
to her new home.

77
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,480
Maybe it's the food.

78
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,040
{\an5}But Constantine sent the other
fugitives

79
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,240
you encountered to hell, so...

80
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,040
{\an5}Well, she's not exactly
a bloodthirsty unicorn.

81
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,960
Or an evil fairy godmother.

82
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,200
But you decided to keep
the shapeshifter because...

83
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,160
{\an5}To exploit her for information
about the inter-dimensional prison

84
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,440
that she's been trapped in to help us
track down other fugitives.

85
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,720
That is...
exactly what we are doing.

86
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,760
One hundred percent.
Isn't that right, Zari?

87
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
Yeah, yeah.

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,600
I'm gathering that intel as we speak.

89
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,400
- I love the initiative, team.
- Yeah.

90
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,880
- Gentlemen.
- Oh, Director Sharpe.

91
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,320
{\an5}Joining us, are we?

92
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,360
{\an5}- Is that a problem?
- Not for me, love.

93
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,520
{\an5}Good, because we are
headed back to the '90s

94
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,280
{\an5}to infiltrate a place
called Camp Ogawa.

95
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,800
Oh, sneaking into a
military facility, are we?

96
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,560
Actually,
it's a summer camp for kids.

97
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,240
Oh, I loved summer camp.

98
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,840
{\an5}Everyone used to call me,
Kid Counselor.

99
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,960
Bet you took that as a compliment,
too, didn't you, mate?

100
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,200
{\an5}Well, because of my
leadership skills, obviously.

101
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,320
- Right? That's why.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

102
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,800
{\an5}So, any idea of what kind of foul
beast we're up against, then?

103
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,440
{\an5}Well, based on... research
Sarah and I have been doing,

104
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,400
{\an5}we could be looking for
a swampy monster thing.

105
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,000
{\an5}According to the timeline,
before the end of summer,

106
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,960
{\an5}several kids went missing,
never to be seen again.

107
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,000
Well, I happen to
know a Swamp Thing.

108
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,720
{\an5}But then again, Maine is way
too far North for that muppet.

109
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,560
Well, we used to use the buddy system
to make sure everyone was safe.

110
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,760
{\an5}And this is where Nate
would say, "I'm your buddy,"

111
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,880
and we'd do a fist bump
or a silly jig or...

112
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,760
{\an5}Well, we are shorthanded,

113
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,360
{\an5}so I need you
to partner up with John.

114
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,360
{\an5}Oh, don't worry, dreamboat.

115
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,520
{\an5}I've had stranger bedfellows
than you.

116
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,320
But just so you know,
I'm not one to get all

117
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,120
gussied up for a gig, all right?

118
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,920
Oh, they may take my coat,
but you will never take my...

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,480
Nope. And lose the tie.

120
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,440
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

121
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Fine.

122
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,920
{\an5}One time, but it's only for the kids.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,240
Yeah, that's the camp spirit.

124
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,000
{\an5}Are these outfits really necessary?

125
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,320
- Girl...
- Come on. Gideon made us

126
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,600
{\an5}official Camp Ogawa
counselor uniforms

127
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,880
{\an5}using archival photos
so that we could fit in.

128
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,840
What are you guys doing
just standing around?

129
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,960
{\an5}Hi, we are
the new camp counselors.

130
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,000
Sorry to show up unannounced.

131
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,800
Well, Freckles,
the name's Paula Cooper.

132
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,200
I'm the director here.

133
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,920
Welcome to Camp Ogawa.

134
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,840
{\an5}My right-hand man, Chad Stephens,
will show you around.

135
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,080
Chad! Get over here.

136
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
What's up?

137
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,440
Chad, you marble cut of prime beef,
give these new counselors the tour.

138
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
{\an5}Cool. All right, hey, let's
bounce over this way.

139
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,040
{\an5}I'll give you the 411
on this place, huh? Yeah.

140
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,280
{\an5}What we need are snipers
on that ridgeline,

141
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,080
{\an5}spotters on the ground,
and an exfil site

142
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,360
for when we bag the creature.

143
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,120
{\an5}Not a bad plan, Sharpie.

144
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,080
{\an5}I'll put a protection spell
around my perimeter

145
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,200
to keep out the nasties.

146
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,440
Best offense is a strong defense.

147
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,720
So, as you can see,
Camp Ogawa is a miserable place,

148
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,840
and Paula runs it like a POW camp.

149
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Not!

150
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,520
Oh, God, not a '90s "not" joke.

151
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,080
It's like comic comfort food.

152
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,600
I'm sorry, I couldn't help
but admire your lanyard.

153
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Did you make that yourself?

154
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,400
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

155
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,800
Yeah, along
with 21 required merit badges,

156
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,320
I also went on to get certification
in nuclear science and dentistry.

157
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,600
{\an5}Oh, snap.
I've got some serious competition

158
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,480
{\an5}for coolest counselor this summer,
huh?

159
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,600
What about you?
You got any special skills?

160
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
Martial arts.

161
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,800
Sorry, it's just so fresh.
It's like, Jackie Chan, you know?

162
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,520
I prefer knives and swords.

163
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,680
Right, yeah. Point taken.

164
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,200
- "Point taken."
- Good one, bro.

165
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,880
Anyway, let's head over here,
all right?

166
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,400
I'm gonna assign you your cabins.

167
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,840
It's gonna be a heck of a summer.

168
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,360
- Okay.
- He'll grow on you.

169
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,080
Greetings, members of Newton Cabin
I am Counselor Ray,

170
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,040
and the mysterious gentleman
behind you is Counselor John.

171
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,120
Cheers, lads.

172
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,200
Well, today's subject
is wilderness survival,

173
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,040
which includes tracking
and orienteering.

174
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Who's excited?

175
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,440
Well, you will be, okay?

176
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,760
Two words to remember
when tracking,

177
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,600
"displacement" and "direction."

178
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,320
Now, Counselor John will demonstrate

179
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,840
the kind of inadvertent markers
people leave behind

180
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,800
while walking in the woods.

181
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,120
And... Counselor John
is missing already.

182
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,480
See how easy it is to get
lost in the woods, gentlemen?

183
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,560
- What's up, Franklin Cabin?
- Whoo!

184
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,760
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

185
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,200
We are in the house.
I am Sara, and this is Ava.

186
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,280
We are your camp counselors.

187
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,400
Now, I was thinking,
we need a secret handshake.

188
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah.

189
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,920
Something really cool
that only we know.

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,680
- Yeah.
- So cool.

191
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,280
- What are you doing?
- Bonding.

192
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,520
How is that supposed
to keep them safe

193
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,760
from what's in the woods?

194
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,320
It allows us to form
a meaningful connection

195
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,280
and them to feel
like they're part of a team.

196
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,200
They aren't gonna be a part
of anything if they're dead.

197
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,320
- Ava.
- We can go back

198
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,920
to the fun and games
once we catch the creature, yes?

199
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,080
All right, ladies... change in plan.

200
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,120
Today we're going to celebrate
your first day of camp

201
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,000
by using safety
and discipline, got it?

202
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Now, when I blow this whistle,
you are to run... not walk...

203
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,560
to your respective beds.

204
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,240
But it's still daytime.

205
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,960
It will feel like nighttime
when your eyes are closed.

206
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,040
Now move!

207
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Very nice.

208
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
What are you doing?

209
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,320
Oh, I'm creating a protective
barrier to catch monsters.

210
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,080
- "Monsters"?
- Yeah.

211
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,000
You know, the kind that
slice your stomach open

212
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,920
and eat your intestines for supper.

213
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,880
Getting those kids to bed was
a lot easier than I expected.

214
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,280
You know, I'm really glad I came.

215
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,320
I just feel bad, we're ruining
camp for these kids.

216
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,000
It's such an important time.

217
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,040
Well, I didn't realize
you were so gung-ho

218
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,200
about this whole camp thing.

219
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,720
I was even Color Captain one year.

220
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,600
Summer after eighth grade.

221
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,640
I really stuck it to Suzy Smith

222
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,240
and the Green Team that year.

223
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,800
- Sounds magical.
- It was.

224
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,440
Unfortunately, we're here
to stop magic, my love.

225
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,920
Well, with us guarding their cabin

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,760
and Constantine's perimeter,
at least no Swampy Monster

227
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,480
is getting into this camp tonight.

228
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Who's there?

229
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,880
- Relax, Lenise. It's just me.
- Zack.

230
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,000
So what do you want to do?

231
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,880
Have you ever kissed
anyone before?

232
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Zack?

233
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
Beautiful morning.

234
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Yeah, sorry to burst your
summer-loving bubble, mate,

235
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,840
but we're missing one
of our young charges.

236
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,000
His name is Zack or something.

237
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,880
Well, are you sure you counted right?

238
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,400
Because based on
your whiskey cologne

239
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,360
- I think you're still drunk.
- No, he's right.

240
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,120
Yeah, a girl is missing
from our cabin, too,

241
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,120
even after I put the fear of God
in them.

242
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,320
Obviously, there's something wrong
with Constantine's booby trap.

243
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,840
Are you off your trolley, mate?

244
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,480
My spell was designed to keep
the monsters from getting in,

245
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,200
not children getting out.

246
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,320
They must have snuck out
in the middle of the night.

247
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,360
Snuck out?
Why would they sneak out?

248
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,800
To make out, duh.

249
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,160
Well, I suppose we should
notify the camp director.

250
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
Okay, guys, so...

251
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,360
Oh, don't worry about those kids.
They're gonna be just fine.

252
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,480
Shouldn't we mount
a search party or...

253
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,840
They couldn't have gotten too far.

254
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,000
Look, Freckles,
this happens every year.

255
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,240
Kids under the influence
of their hormones

256
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,400
go off into the woods at night.

257
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,920
Just watch. They'll eventually
get hungry and tired,

258
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,080
and they'll come back.

259
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
Now go out there
and do some counseling.

260
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,280
Well, someone gives
precisely zero craps

261
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,880
about the safety of our campers.

262
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,360
I guarantee you one of these kids
knows where the other two went.

263
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,720
How can you be so sure?

264
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,200
Because when I was in camp,

265
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
we used to hide stuff from
the counselors all the time.

266
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,720
We just need to figure out
how to get them to talk.

267
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,480
Circle of trust creates a safe space

268
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,200
for us to share our secrets
without judgment.

269
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Now, take each other's hands.

270
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,760
- Now I want you...
- Yeah, sorry to butt in, lads.

271
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,400
But, can I have a word
with you for a second?

272
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,800
I want you to meditate
on the word "openness,"

273
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,120
and I'll be right back.

274
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
You're interrupt...

275
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,360
You're interrupting the flow.

276
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,160
Yeah, well, apologies
to you and your flow,

277
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,880
but all of your psychobabble
that ain't gonna cut the mustard

278
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,960
with the young ones, mate.
Let me show you how it's done.

279
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,160
Right, then, which one
of you whippersnappers

280
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,000
wants to be hypnotized?

281
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,320
Me, me, me, me!

282
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,960
Alexis, you and Lenise
are besties, right?

283
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,440
We were partners
in last year's talent show.

284
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,840
She didn't show up
at roll call this morning.

285
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,200
I'm worried. Do you know
where she might have gone?

286
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,480
All right, ladies, on your feet.

287
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,960
Report to the front of your bed,
arms by your sides, now.

288
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,120
What is with the police lineup?

289
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,320
This is summer camp,
not boot camp, remember?

290
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,800
You are too soft on these kids.
Children crave authority.

291
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,040
Besides, my way will be quicker.

292
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
That's it.

293
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,360
Look at my watch.

294
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,640
Now, where did your mate Zack
run off to last night?

295
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,320
He didn't say.

296
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,040
But I hope he didn't go
near the outdoor showers.

297
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Why?

298
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,080
What's by the outdoor showers?

299
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,200
That's where I hid
my Victoria's Secret catalog.

300
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,840
Your friend Lenise snuck
out of the cabin last night.

301
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,960
And no one's going anywhere
until I find out where she went.

302
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,680
But the ice cream social
is in, like, five minutes.

303
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,720
Well, then you better,
like, start talking, Kiana,

304
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,560
or you're gonna have to scrape
the bottom of the carton

305
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
for what's left.

306
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,720
Last night Zack said something
about meeting someone in the woods.

307
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,320
Where in the woods exactly?

308
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,680
A baseball field.

309
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,640
Only, there's no baseball field
out there.

310
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,160
Well, that's all right.

311
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,280
Keep digging.

312
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,440
He kept talking about making
it to first base with a girl.

313
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,000
But who plays baseball in the dark?

314
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,000
She probably went to the
same place your style went.

315
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,240
You could use a makeover,
like, head to toe.

316
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,960
<i>Ms. Tomaz, the prisoner
is growing quite unruly.</i>

317
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,240
Tell her to knock herself out.

318
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,320
I take that back.

319
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,320
Darn it, not on my watch.

320
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,480
Okay, I feel like we got
off on the wrong foot.

321
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,280
It's just that you're wearing
my friend's face,

322
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
and it's a little unsettling,
given your...

323
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,680
general demeanor.

324
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Look...

325
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,480
I didn't love it at first
when I got here,

326
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,520
but I found my place.
You can too.

327
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,280
Take a look in the mirror,
sweetheart.

328
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
It's not my face
that should be unsettling.

329
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,120
You're the one
putting things in cages.

330
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,640
So how many girls has the missus made
cry so far, or have you lost count?

331
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,640
Ava's interrogation techniques
aren't going to work on them.

332
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,120
They'd rather take their secrets
to the grave than squeal.

333
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Anything with the boys?

334
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,200
Oh, those boys aren't hiding a thing.

335
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,960
They're open books,
if those books were written

336
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,200
by hapless fools, that is.

337
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,720
If I could just become one of them,
another 12-year-old camper,

338
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,760
I could get these girls to talk
like that.

339
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,560
I do believe
that you've just sparked

340
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,600
an idea there, Ms. Lance.

341
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,200
End of the road, kid.

342
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,280
In your cage.

343
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,320
Bloke like you
doesn't strike me as a jailer.

344
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,680
I believe we're more alike
than you think.

345
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,000
You look like
you've been on the inside.

346
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,120
That's right.

347
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,760
And how do you sleep at night,

348
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,680
hanging out with these
jailer mates of yours?

349
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
Alcohol.

350
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,760
Oh, hey. I made an additional
list of suspects

351
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,160
- I want to question.
- Ava...

352
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,600
Look, I know that you just want them
to have fun, all right?

353
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,520
But the fact of the matter is,
there is a monster

354
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,960
out there hunting down these kids,

355
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,520
and these girls
are stonewalling us, okay?

356
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,000
Counselor Ava?

357
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,120
Yes?

358
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,720
I'm ready to tell you
what's really going on.

359
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,920
Go on, honey. Spill the beans.

360
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,880
It won't stop unless
you do something.

361
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,080
What won't stop?

362
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,280
The monster that lives under
the dock, the lake beast.

363
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,600
Who's the lake beast?

364
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,960
Years ago, at this very camp,

365
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,960
some mean kids played
a prank on a boy,

366
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,400
and he drowned in the lake.

367
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,640
And now every year he returns
to get his revenge.

368
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,960
And so you think the
lake beast took your friends?

369
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,680
They say the only way
to make him appear

370
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,880
is to go to the dock alone
and call his name three times.

371
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,320
Sweetie, you are so brave,
and I promise you,

372
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,600
the lake beast won't be getting
anyone tonight, okay?

373
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,840
Guys.

374
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,400
Guys, I think I see
a Northern Saw-whet Owl.

375
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,320
Ray, focus.

376
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,240
Fine. I'll save it
for my bird-watching journal.

377
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,720
Okay, you're in the clear, Ava.

378
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,080
Stupid bird.

379
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,600
Okay, let's get this over with.

380
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,320
Lake Beast, Lake Beast, Lake Beast.

381
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,960
Guys, this feels like a bust to me.

382
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,880
It was just a bloody prank.

383
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,960
Go, go, go.

384
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,840
You okay?

385
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,880
Nice night for a swim,
though, Sharpie?

386
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,720
Those girls are monsters!

387
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,120
After we left the lake last night,

388
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,800
another one of our
campers went missing.

389
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,280
Another one
of ours is missing, too.

390
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,760
That makes four in total.

391
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
They must have snuck out
to meet up with each other

392
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,440
and never made it back.

393
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,800
Yeah, well, I don't know
about you lot,

394
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,680
but I'm not just sitting around here

395
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,000
waiting for the monster
to go and get another kid.

396
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,280
We better split up.

397
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,200
All right, you two check the
woods for the missing kids.

398
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,080
Ava and I... stay watch here.

399
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,960
Hey, wait, buddy system!

400
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,800
I heard about last night.

401
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,240
It's majorly uncool.

402
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,480
Who knew kids could be so mean?

403
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,720
They've been calling me Lake Beast
behind my back all day.

404
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,240
- Excuse me, Lake Beast.
- And to my face.

405
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,440
Okay. Hey, that is enough, ladies.
The joke is over.

406
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,760
It's time for you to behave,
or else your cabin will be banned

407
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,200
from the July Jamboree.

408
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,240
The only way we are going to
get any information

409
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,160
from these girls
is to infiltrate their clique.

410
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,000
How are we supposed to do that?
We're not kids.

411
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,840
Funny you should say that.

412
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Constantine gave me a potion
that would turn us into kids

413
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,960
- only temporarily.
- You're kidding, right?

414
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,920
What... even if it works, Sara,

415
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,440
I wouldn't have any idea
how to act like a kid

416
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,680
because I've never been one.

417
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,960
All my childhood memories
are fake, remember?

418
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,840
How are we going to find the
kids with that dangly thing?

419
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,920
You know, this ritual
usually works best

420
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,680
when someone isn't yammering
in my ear hole.

421
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,040
Well, you want to find the kids,

422
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,440
we got to do it
the old-fashioned way.

423
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,240
Study their tracks.

424
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,360
It's a good thing I came prepared,

425
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,560
because one step
in the wrong direction here,

426
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,880
and you'll be traveling
for miles in the wrong...

427
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,720
Darn it, you Nandy Pandy,
I said I need silence.

428
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,960
Oh, you meant right now.
I'm sorry, I thought you meant...

429
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,640
Why are you being such a jerk?

430
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,160
Because you shouldn't
even be out here

431
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,960
chasing a magical creature,
all right?

432
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
It's too dangerous.

433
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,440
Too dangerous?

434
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,400
You're lucky you're out here with me,

435
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,800
because I can keep us alive
on bugs and berries alone.

436
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,920
You know, this has nothing
to do with survival in the wild

437
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and everything to do with
surviving magical creatures

438
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,000
and those who dabble
in the dark arts.

439
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,400
I'll have you know, I am no
stranger to the world of magic.

440
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
Yeah.

441
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,320
Oh, don't think I haven't
heard how Nora Darhk

442
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,560
had you eating out of the palm
of her wicked little hand.

443
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,520
Oh, I bet she didn't
even have to ask

444
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,040
for the time stone, did she?

445
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,800
No, you just gave it away
like biscuits at tea time.

446
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,120
Nora and I have a mutual
respect for each other.

447
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,840
It's not like
I was tripping over myself...

448
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What is that?

449
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,640
No doubt left behind
by the magical beast.

450
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,200
Who sheds its skin
after it eats the kids?

451
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,960
What are we looking for?
Some sort of snake monster?

452
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,600
The answer is in this book.

453
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,080
Is that a magical Audubon guide?

454
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,640
Neat-o.

455
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,040
It's good. What is it?

456
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,720
Hooch. I spent a little time
in a Siberian gulag.

457
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,280
Got a taste for it.

458
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,360
Where I was it felt like 500 years.

459
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,240
Time worked differently
in that realm.

460
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,360
Oh, I've been in a lot of cages,
but not a magical one.

461
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,440
What was it like?

462
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,880
The inside of my cage
was a constant battle

463
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,760
between creatures
from your worst nightmare.

464
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,800
I, uh, got to know some of them
better than I wanted to.

465
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,000
It was a dismal and a dark dimension,

466
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,360
like nothing here on Earth.

467
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,280
And I'll be damned
if I'm ever going back.

468
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,400
Well, cheers to that.

469
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,840
Friendship bracelet?

470
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,960
No, it's an "I'm sorry" bracelet.

471
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,200
I shouldn't have run off like that.

472
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,040
It's just that you know
I'm not normal,

473
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,680
and I think you hit a nerve
or something.

474
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,680
No, I'm sorry.

475
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,760
I never even thought about the fact
that you'd never been a kid.

476
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,160
- Yeah.
- But this is really good.

477
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,040
I confiscated it from Alexis.

478
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,240
See, I'm weird. I...

479
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,680
Do you know that those two
actors who are my parents...

480
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,960
I keep a picture of them
on my desk in my office

481
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,040
just so I can try to feel
a little bit normal.

482
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,920
- Yeah, that is anything but normal.
- Yeah.

483
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,240
<i>Guys. I think we've ID'd our monster.</i>

484
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,480
Constantine and I found a skin suit
shed by something called a <i>shtriga</i>.

485
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,320
- Come again?
<i>- A shtriga.</i>

486
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,600
It's a vampiric witch.

487
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,200
It feeds off the life force
of children.

488
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,800
Bloody brilliant
setting up shop at summer camp.

489
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,560
There's some good news, sort of.

490
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,160
It says here the shtriga
feeds slowly off its prey

491
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,480
draining its life energy
over a course of days,

492
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,800
which means the missing kids
could still be alive.

493
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,800
Then it's on you guys to find them.

494
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
All right.

495
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,560
Okay, and it's on us
to protect these girls.

496
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,120
Now, I know you think I'm crazy,

497
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,800
but what if the best way
to protect them

498
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,160
is by becoming one of them
and lure the creature out?

499
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,720
We'll be the bait.

500
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,480
What if Constantine's
potion doesn't work on me?

501
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,280
There's only one way to find out.

502
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,960
And if it does, I'll be
with you every step of the way.

503
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,400
Show you the ropes.
Teach you how to be a kid.

504
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,400
Pinkie swear?

505
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,160
Pinkie swear.

506
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,960
All right, lights out, everyone!

507
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,120
Hey, that means you, too,
Hopper Cabin.

508
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,440
Don't make me come in there.

509
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,560
Do you feel anything yet?

510
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,320
No.

511
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,360
Maybe it doesn't work.

512
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,920
The pretty lights tell me otherwise.

513
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,560
Hey, what are
you two doing in here?

514
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,640
Oh, snap.

515
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,280
Where did you guys come from
out of the blue?

516
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,840
Got kicked out of Clark Cabin

517
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,560
for putting a frog under
Christi Donovan's pillow.

518
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,800
You should have heard her scream.

519
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,560
- Cool.
- And you?

520
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,440
I was kicked out 'cause I was caught
reading after lights out.

521
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Reading? Lame.

522
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,800
Her counselors only
thought she was reading,

523
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,760
but really she was writing
a letter to her boyfriend.

524
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,120
He lives in France.

525
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,800
This year's counselors are the worst.

526
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,760
- Especially Lake Beast.
- Yeah, I heard she smells bad.

527
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,080
Hey...

528
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,560
Yeah, I heard she looked really funny
when she fell into the water.

529
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,720
But you're lucky
she didn't catch pneumonia.

530
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,840
That's a very serious illness.

531
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
Sure.

532
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,800
You must have had balls
to survive that hellhole.

533
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,400
Did what I had to...

534
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,640
shapeshifted into whatever monster
would keep the others off my back.

535
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,680
But you know exactly what it's like

536
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,880
pretending to be something
worse than you are to survive.

537
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,840
Well, there's that.

538
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,080
And there's finding someone
you trust.

539
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,600
I did time in supermax
with my old partner.

540
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,400
It's harder to plot against a team.

541
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,640
I spent all my time
shapeshifting and running.

542
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,920
I never stuck around
one place long enough

543
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,920
to find anyone that I could trust.

544
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,920
Well, you got to start somewhere.

545
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,080
Hey, it's me, Sara.
You guys still out there?

546
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,800
Sara? Potion actually worked?

547
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,080
You didn't know
if it was going to work

548
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,720
before you gave us the potion?

549
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,240
Well, of course I didn't.
I never tested it on humans, have I?

550
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,400
- Darn it, John.
<i>- Well, just see it like this,</i>

551
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,960
you two have now turned yourselves
into irresistible shtriga bait.

552
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,680
So any suggestions
on how a couple of kids

553
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,160
can take on a magical
child-eating hag?

554
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,520
Well, if you're in a pinch,

555
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,080
you can always <i>trycapsicum annuum</i>...

556
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,800
more commonly known
as cayenne pepper.

557
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,240
Witches hate the stuff.
But you'll be fine. Cheers, love.

558
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,880
Great. But where are we going to get
cayenne pepper?

559
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,440
Follow my lead.

560
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,720
The shtriga's lair can't be far now.

561
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,200
Look, a camper must have tried
to hide from the shtriga here.

562
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,160
What are you doing? Oh, a spell?

563
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,720
Yep.

564
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,800
Will-o the wisp.

565
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,160
Little bugger will lead us
to whoever owns that shirt.

566
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,360
Well, go on then, light the way.

567
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,400
Look at us,
pair of magical detectives.

568
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,280
Oh, and I was beginning
to think you were all right

569
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,480
till you went and said that.

570
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,440
You know, there are other
dabblers of the dark arts

571
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,920
out there who think
that I'm all right.

572
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,200
Referring to Nora Darhk, are we?

573
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,640
You best stay away
from that witch, mate.

574
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,800
Not even your big heart can
keep you safe from someone

575
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,920
who's wrestled with literal demons.

576
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,400
What about you?
You're one of us now.

577
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,560
You even dressed up
for a little while.

578
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,280
You've wrestled with demons,
and you're good.

579
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,840
Just listen to me, all right?

580
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,560
You know, I had a friend like you.

581
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,160
Someone good,
someone who trusted me.

582
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,040
Be smarter than him, all right?

583
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,480
Save yourself, Ray Palmer,

584
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,440
because people like me
and Nora Darhk...

585
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,640
we're bloody hell
for people like you.

586
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,480
Truth or dare?

587
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,360
Truth.

588
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,280
- I... think you meant dare.
- Dare?

589
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,520
Dare. I mean dare.

590
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,880
I dare you to sneak out of the cabin
and break into the mess hall.

591
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,360
But to prove that
you didn't chicken out,

592
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,880
you have to bring us something
back from the kitchen.

593
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,520
Well, this must be the place.

594
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,440
Alexis, who would you
rather have babies with?

595
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,800
Jonathan Taylor Thomas
or Mario Lopez?

596
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,560
I ran into some trouble.

597
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,600
I knew it. She chickened out.

598
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,360
I tried to carry more,

599
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,400
but I could only sneak out
with two of these.

600
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,960
I know you missed
the ice cream social, so...

601
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,360
ice cream social is coming to you.

602
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,520
Rocky road
and mint chocolate chip...

603
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,720
you're the best ever.

604
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,800
And I have something just for us.

605
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,360
That's my girl.

606
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,480
Oh, I've seen enough horror movie
trailers to know this won't end well.

607
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,760
Those films are nothing
compared to the horrors

608
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,360
you might see in real life.

609
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,840
Are we too late?

610
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,200
We'll need an incantation,
a crystal, and a conduit

611
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,240
to draw their pilfered
life force from the shtriga

612
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,720
and back into their bodies.

613
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,040
Now, just follow my lead
and do everything I say.

614
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,880
We really needed this.

615
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,640
Camp's been kind of rough this year.

616
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,800
What do you mean?

617
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,160
It's okay. You can talk to us.

618
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,200
We're super worried
about Lenise and Meredith.

619
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,960
We didn't want to say anything
for the longest time.

620
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,360
We thought we'd get in trouble
and ruin everything.

621
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,120
Ruin what?

622
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,720
The midnight meet-up.
It's a tradition.

623
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,880
Every summer, girls take turns

624
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,240
choosing guys they like to meet up
with in the woods.

625
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,560
There's a string
that starts near the flagpole,

626
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,360
and it leads out into
the meeting spot.

627
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,840
It changes every year.

628
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,160
So they meet up, and what's
supposed to happen next?

629
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,520
Well, you're supposed to have
your first kiss and come back.

630
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,560
But Lenise and Meredith
never came back.

631
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,000
We got to be getting close, right?

632
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
What was that?

633
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,160
It's way past lights out.

634
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,800
What punishment
should I cook up for you?

635
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,240
Come here, you two.

636
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,120
Get off me, you crusty old witch!

637
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,960
My eyes!

638
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,760
Is she dead?

639
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,960
All right, our team's dealing
with something called a shtriga.

640
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Do you know anything
that could help them fight it?

641
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,240
Oh, a shtriga.

642
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,440
Very intelligent and very deadly.

643
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,400
If you want my help,
it's going to cost you.

644
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,120
Great. Will that come
in the form of another haiku,

645
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,400
or can we expect something
a little more detailed?

646
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,280
What's that?
What was that eye thing?

647
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,800
According to legend,
shtrigas are nasty old women,

648
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,120
but the one that I met in prison,

649
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,080
the one that you're looking for,

650
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,080
is beautiful.

651
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,200
And he's a bloke.

652
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,000
What the hell are you doing?

653
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,640
Hey, you don't have another
bathroom break

654
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,240
for, oh, that's right, never,
since you tried to break my face.

655
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,640
It is now or never.

656
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,400
Fine. Whatever.

657
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,000
Guys, this shtriga thing
is not an old woman.

658
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,080
- What's going on out here?
<i>- You are looking for a young,</i>

659
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,600
<i>handsome dude.</i>

660
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,760
Are you ready, big man?

661
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,120
On with the show, then.

662
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,760
- What did you guys do to her?
- We didn't do anything.

663
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,400
Look, it's not safe
for you guys out here.

664
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,840
Okay? You're coming with me.

665
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,520
We can take care of ourselves.

666
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,160
You're coming with me
whether you like it or not.

667
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,560
You think you're so tough?

668
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,760
I don't think it. I know it.

669
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,120
It's working.

670
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,680
It worked.

671
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,360
That was worse than a hangover.

672
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,680
Oh, no.

673
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,000
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on, lad, wake up.

674
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,160
Wake up, lad.
Wake up. Come on, son.

675
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,880
Darn it.

676
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,960
Bollocks.

677
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,720
I'm not losing another kid.

678
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,240
What are you doing?

679
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,360
John!

680
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,160
John. Come on.

681
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,040
John? Come on, John. John.

682
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,400
Darn it.

683
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,040
Any of you got... got a light?

684
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,160
- What happened?
- You saved him.

685
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,360
You saved Randall.

686
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
That's good.

687
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,880
I'm gonna get you back to the ship.

688
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,360
I'm not sure how I'm gonna
get the rest of you out.

689
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,080
We found you guys.

690
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,080
We got worried when you
didn't show up for dinner.

691
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,440
Those kids look famished.

692
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,160
Get them water
and electrolytes, stat.

693
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,000
And that gurney we just made
out of rope and wood... bring it in.

694
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,680
Had a hunch it
would come in handy.

695
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,080
How did you find us?

696
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,280
Displacement and direction,
just like you taught us.

697
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,280
Good job, Toby.

698
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,120
John's potion
will be wearing off soon,

699
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,800
and it's back to our normal lives,

700
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,760
where we're only responsible
for babysitting Rory and Gary.

701
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,640
I'd like to thank you for giving me
real childhood memories.

702
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,000
To be honest, these memories
have been kind of awful...

703
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,200
mostly awkward, but...

704
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,040
totally awesome.

705
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,920
I mean, it wouldn't be childhood
without all of the above.

706
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,120
I'm happy it was with you.

707
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,480
And considering all the trouble
those kids went through for a kiss...

708
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,200
I'm guessing no childhood
would be complete without one.

709
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,400
Couldn't help but notice
our magical friend

710
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,720
is not where
she's supposed to be.

711
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,240
Oh, she's not?

712
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,680
Rory, do you know
anything about that?

713
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,440
You don't pay me enough
to be a stinkin' prison guard.

714
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,160
I don't pay you anything.

715
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,000
Well, I let the fake Amaya go.

716
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,120
Why would you do that?

717
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,920
Oh, in order to

718
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,680
have an extreme makeover.

719
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,120
Thanks for the shtriga tip.

720
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,960
Well, if you had your hands
full with a shtriga,

721
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,640
I figured you'd need my help
with whatever you plebs face next.

722
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,960
Sounds like a mutually
beneficial partnership.

723
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,880
One condition, though...

724
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,720
I never set foot
in that cage ever again. Got it?

725
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,960
<i>Mr. Constantine's body
is rejecting my treatments.</i>

726
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,560
<i>His odds of survival are bleak.</i>

727
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,000
John, what you did
out there was pretty selfless.

728
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,280
I told you you were good.

729
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,280
That's not good for you.

730
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,120
Get some rest, John.

731
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,920
Gideon, give him the good stuff.

732
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,440
Oh, Gideon.

733
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,200
That's nice, love.
We should party...

734
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,240
He's getting worse.

735
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,520
The magic he used to save that
camper was pretty powerful.

736
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,200
Well, if magic has him
on death's door,

737
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,400
then maybe magic can save him.

738
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,480
I think I know someone who can help.

739
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,720
But I have no idea how to find her.

740
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,200
Just one final ingredient.

741
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,960
I trust you'll find
that my potion is magical.

742
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,960
You call that soup?

743
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,920
Oh, I can start over.

744
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,920
The Ren Fair opens in an hour.

745
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,480
You know what? Forget it.

746
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,880
It's not like folks come to
this tent for the food anyways.

747
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,960
I'm sorry?

748
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,800
They come for the lusty wenches.

749
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,040
I'm... I'm a witch.

750
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,200
Okay, well, as long
as it's a lusty witch, okay?
