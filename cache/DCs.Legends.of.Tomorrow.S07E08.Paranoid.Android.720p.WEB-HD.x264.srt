00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:16,191
I could take
the time to explain

164
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:17,192
the exact science to you.

165
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:18,585
Science is lame.

166
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:19,673
You're lame!

167
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:20,935
Nice comeback.

170
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:25,156
Nate, take the team

171
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,810
to the epicenter
of the aberration.

172
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:29,247
Lay low until I rendezvous
with more information.

173
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,902
And what are you gonna do?

174
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:34,644
Something I need
to look into.

175
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:37,473
Come on. Let's go.

176
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:48,615
Sorry to interrupt, Doc.

177
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:53,707
You should be in the field.
I don't need to remind you

178
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,274
that your android doppelgangers
are still at large.

179
00:08:56,318 --> 00:08:59,843
I just wanted
to say thank you.

180
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:01,584
Thank me for what?

181
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:03,760
That patch-up job
you did on my team.

182
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:05,327
I thought they were goners.

183
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:09,592
They were lucky.

184
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,420
And back on their feet
so soon.

185
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:13,901
I advised Zari and Astra
to stay on the ship.

186
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:15,772
They're more suited
for intelligence work.

187
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:17,165
You seem to have
a lot of thoughts

- You're just supposed to die.

Oh, you're clearly
crazy person.

327
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,490
What kind of superheroes

give them cancer?

They've already heard the news.

354
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,827
We can't put this genie
back in the bottle.

355
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:45,047
Gideon,
what was supposed to happen

356
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,353
in the original timeline?

357
00:16:46,396 --> 00:16:47,919
<i>According to my records,</i>

358
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:49,443
<i>the city of Pripyat</i> <i>
was evacuated</i>

The Robo-Legends just
gave them a 37-hour head start.

361
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:57,407
Wait,
if you killed the TV broadcast,

362
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:59,496
does that mean
you can also hijack it?

363
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,194
There's nothing I can't hack.

364
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:02,978
Then I think there's a way
to put the genie

365
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,327
back into the bottle.

366
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:06,068
All right, QB team,
what's the plan?

367
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:08,331
Come on,
we're on a deadline here.

368
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,767
Fake news broadcast.

369
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:11,030
We pretend
the first broadcast

370
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,422
was just a false alarm.

371
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,033
Everyone hears it,
heads back home,

372
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:15,295
the reactor melts down--

373
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:17,993
Boom.
History's back on track.

374
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,951
Huh?

375
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:21,823
Okay, that plan doesn't sound
like it involves much shooting.

376
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:23,303
- Or punching.
- Sounds like something

377
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:25,087
those other Legends
would come up with.

378
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:31,441
Gary's right,
but even if we manage

379
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:34,096
to get ourselves on TV,
no one's gonna listen to us.

380
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,231
They won't be
listening to you.

381
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:40,798
Boom's in the shot.

382
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:45,673
You want me to tell them
there is no meltdown?

383
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:46,674
Why would I that?

384
00:17:46,717 --> 00:17:48,067
Because if you don't,

385
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,590
history's gonna be
jacked, dingus.

386
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,113
Just like your face.

387
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:54,377
No.

388
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:56,858
Never.

389
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:58,294
I won't do it.

390
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:04,648
Ah, I'm sorry,
I thought you said--

391
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:07,608
I said I will not lie
to the Soviet people.

392
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:10,001
Haven't they been
lied to enough?

393
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:12,395
First, they were told
that Chernobyl plant is safe,

394
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:14,658
and now you want me
to tell them to return

395
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:16,443
to a nuclear meltdown--

396
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,274
It's either that
or a Steel Punch.

397
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:23,972
Compared to radiation poisoning,

398
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:27,454
that seems like
a good way to die.

399
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:29,804
Bah!

400
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:34,678
This guy's good.

401
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:36,202
So he doesn't care
about himself.

402
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:39,379
There must be someone
the general cares about.

403
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:41,424
I'll see what I can find
on his family.

404
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:45,080
Normally, military records
are sealed, but...

405
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:48,388
Nice hacking.

406
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:51,304
Let's see how the general feels
if something bad were to happen

407
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:55,134
to little Dmitri,
or his sister, Ulyana.

408
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:59,573
You would threaten
to harm my children?

409
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:01,618
You people are truly monsters!

410
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:04,795
They've done nothing!

411
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,319
He's right.

412
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:08,538
And according to Gideon,
they go on to do nothing.

413
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:11,280
Which means we can
remove them from the timeline

414
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:12,847
without consequence!

415
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:16,198
Where do we find
these rug rats?

416
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:17,852
All right, whoa, time-out.

417
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:20,550
Team meeting.

418
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:25,207
Threatening this guy's
one thing,

419
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:27,296
but we're not actually
gonna hurt his kids.

420
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,428
Are we?
- Mm...

421
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:29,864
- Why not?
- Eh...

422
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:32,736
The aberration's
getting bigger.

423
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,085
There's red
all over the place.

424
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:35,609
Red ain't good.

425
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:37,393
Hey, we are supposed
to be the good guys.

426
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:39,352
And I know our job
is to protect history, but--

427
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:43,530
Gary, put him down!

428
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:45,227
You just ate, like,
five minutes ago.

429
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:47,490
I told you
you can eat him after he wraps.

430
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:51,842
Sara.

431
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,236
What have I done?

432
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,196
I'll avenge you, Captain.

433
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,545
Will you just knock it off?

434
00:19:58,588 --> 00:19:59,937
Sometimes, I forget
how fragile

435
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:01,374
you non-steel humans are.

436
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,114
Would you all
just get it together?

437
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:05,029
All right? I'm fine.

438
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:07,380
Actually, you're not fine.
Your blood pressure's dropping.

439
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:09,033
- You gotta be kidding me.
- No.

440
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:10,644
You need to return
to the ship, Captain, now.

441
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:12,385
I don't like what's going on
with your vitals.

442
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:13,951
Look, I told you, I'm fine.

443
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:15,562
We just need to figure out
another way to--

444
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:19,609
I am ordering you
to the ship, stat.

445
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:21,045
While Captain Lance
is indisposed,

446
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:23,570
I'm putting you
in charge, Nate.

447

Don't worry, Captain.

448
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:27,313
I got it.

449
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:30,359
That's what I'm afraid of.

450
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,275

I can make
my own diagnosis, Captain.

468

Hmm. I'm gonna need to operate.

469
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:17,145
Operate?
It's just a scratch.

470
