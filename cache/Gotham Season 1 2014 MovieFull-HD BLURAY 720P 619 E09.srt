1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,962
FISH: Killing Falcone would only
create chaos. I need to siphon his strength.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,291
So when the time is right, taking over his
organization will be like slipping on a glove.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,444
I'm so angry all the time.
Will it ever go away?

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,440
Alfred, can you teach me how to fight?

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,166
GORDON: You've been through a lot.
BARBARA: I'm scared, Jim.

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,523
Everywhere I go,
I can feel that monster Zsasz.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,162
ALVAREZ: Gordon, some unis
brought in a perp. Claims to know you.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,203
Hey, detective.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,761
Miss me?

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,883
Barbara?

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,247
SELINA:
Whoa.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,163
Sweet crib.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,529
You must be one rich cop.

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,641
- It's my girlfriend's place.
- Where is she?

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,764
I don't know. Barbara?

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,764
So, what? I get to stay here alone?

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,609
I'm hungry.

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,251
BARBARA: <i>Dear Jim, I thought I could
be strong and brave for you, but I can't.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,281
<i>Every place I go, I see Falcone and Zsasz.

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,326
<i>I'm nervous and needy and screwed up.
I know that's not what you need or want.

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,966
<i>So I'm going away
for a while to get myself together.

22
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,528
This is Gordon.

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,684
Oh. Uh, right, yeah. We're in the penthouse.
Come on up.

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,363
Sounds like your girlfriend's
not coming back, huh?

25
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,529
Why is she worried about Falcone?

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,006
None of your business.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,606
What happens now?
You gonna get the charges dropped?

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,610
I will, but you're my only witness
to the Wayne murders.

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,808
You gonna cuff me to a drainpipe again?

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,447
I'm not gonna hold you against your will.
G.C.P.D., juvie, you'd break out.

31
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,409
So I do get to stay here.

32
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,404
No. I have someplace else in mind.

33
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,161
That's the sketch artist. I need you
to describe the man who shot the Waynes.

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,483
Wait, where am I going to stay?

35
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,041
Wayne Manor.

36
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,921
Don't speak to the inmate. Don't touch
the inmate unless in service of your job.

37
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,970
Don't accept anything from the inmate
under any circumstances.

38
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,446
Who is this guy, anyway?

39
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,881
OFFICER 1:
Ian Hargrove. Some genius bomb maker.

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,162
Took out over a dozen buildings
in Gotham.

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,362
OFFICER 2:
The one that blew up the commissary?

42
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,166
Yeah. He did it with match shavings
and apple cider vinegar.

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,124
So no mistakes today, got it?

44
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,169
GUARD:
Raise your hands up.

45
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,131
GORDON: She said this is the man
who killed your parents.

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,848
She said she saw his face.

47
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,203
Do you recognize him, Bruce?

48
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,684
No.

49
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,691
What's her name?

50
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,211
Selina Kyle.

51
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,841
- Do you believe her?
- Yes, I do.

52
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,849
So she saw everything?

53
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,888
And you want her to live here with us,
do you?

54
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,880
Common street criminal.

55
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,045
She's hardly older than Bruce.
She's just a kid who's seen too much.

56
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,562
This is for her safety.
G.C.P.D. is full of moles.

57
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,888
How long would you have us
put her up, then?

58
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,320
I don't know.

59
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,161
No, the answer is no. Her being
here will put Master Bruce in great danger.

60
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,521
Alfred.

61
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,810
She is the witness to a murder, Master
Bruce. You do understand that, don't you?

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,881
She's also the best chance we have
at finding who killed my parents. Isn't she?

63
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,048
Yes, she is.

64
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,727
Then she can stay.

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,045
As long as it takes.

66
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,201
I've made my decision.

67
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,723
Yes, Master Bruce.

68
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,971
Look, I know this is a lot,
but I'm doing everything I can.

69
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,528
Montoya, Allen and I are meeting
with an ADA they trust this afternoon.

70
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,284
Oh, a trustworthy lawyer. In Gotham.

71
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,889
Look, if we find this guy, we'll need her.

72
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,243
She'll have to testify before a judge.

73
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,967
Won't be easy.
Witnesses back out all the time.

74
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,084
The ones that stick it out
do so because they care about the victims.

75
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,764
We'll do our best to be nice to her, then,
won't we?

76
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,364
That's from the Chinese Ming Dynasty.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,240
Five.

78
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,565
Five hundred years old.

79
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,211
You can get one just like it
for 5 bucks in Chinatown.

80
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,649
I'm Bruce Wayne.

81
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,484
Selina Kyle.

82
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,249
People call me Cat.

83
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,010
Nice to meet you, Cat.

84
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,009
What are you doing?

85
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,129
- Nothing.
- What's in your hand?

86
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,322
I said, what's in--?

87
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,725
What the hell?

88
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,011
[GROANS]

89
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,968
Hargrove!

90
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,362
Ian Hargrove, time to go.

91
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,687
MAN:
Kid, you screwed up, bigtime.

92
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,044
But you're still young. You deserve
a second chance. I have a bet for you.

93
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,486
You call heads or tails.

94
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,728
You lose, you go to jail.

95
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,001
You win, we let you go.

96
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,363
- Bet.
- Hold on, there's a catch.

97
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,170
You have to make a promise to God.
If you win, you're gonna take this as a sign...

98
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,684
...that you need to go back to school
and get your life straight. Can you promise?

99
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,009
- Do you promise that?
- Yes, sir.

100
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,930
Okay, then.

101
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,969
- Call.
- Heads.

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,005
Walk away, kid.
Somebody up there loves you.

103
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,924
Hey, Harvey.

104
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,688
Go. Remember your promise.

105
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,284
Jim Gordon, G.C.P.D.
I hear good things about you, counselor.

106
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,608
Harvey Dent. Likewise about you, detective.

107
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,368
Was some trick with the coin. What if he
guesses wrong? Gonna send him to jail?

108
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,370
Teenagers, they nearly always call heads.
Don't know why.

109
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,964
Two-headed coin.

110
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,200
Whatever works, right?

111
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,082
So who is he, Jim?
Who really killed the Waynes?

112
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,408
Well, this is what we have.

113
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,884
No ID.

114
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,890
But this is from an eyewitness
that you have in custody.

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,209
It's not enough to go to the law with.
Even if we had ID...

116
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,368
...it's the people who hired him we want.

117
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,121
I agree.
Your eyewitness is useless in a courtroom.

118
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,008
But the idea of your witness
could be immensely valuable.

119
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,330
Ever hear the name Dick Lovecraft?

120
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,047
Sure. Billionaire.
Property. Construction. Chemicals.

121
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,366
As corrupt as they come.

122
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,769
Falcone, Maroni, even Wayne Enterprises.
Lovecraft has dealings with all of them.

123
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,282
Since the Waynes' deaths, he's doubled his
fortune, including a piece of the Arkham deal.

124
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,286
DENT: Lovecraft had a long feud
with Thomas Wayne over deals and politics.

125
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,807
They couldn't have had
a more different vision for Gotham.

126
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,685
I'd bet my career
on his involvement in the Wayne murders.

127
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,927
That's a big bet.

128
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,600
I want to use your witness
to go after Lovecraft.

129
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,644
How? My witness can't connect
Lovecraft to the perp.

130
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,761
Lovecraft doesn't know that.

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,525
I'll let it leak out...

132
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,247
...that we have a secret eyewitness
who's going to blow the case wide open...

133
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,568
...and connect Lovecraft
to the Wayne killings.

134
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,086
Lovecraft will get very nervous.

135
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,649
The people around him will get nervous.
And that's when people start talking.

136
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,842
Unless Lovecraft wasn't involved.

137
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,122
If so, which I doubt, we still win.

138
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,642
Whoever was involved
will get their cage rattled, won't they?

139
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,684
- Bet he makes a move.
- You like to bet a lot.

140
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,966
What have we got to lose?

141
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,083
- My witness becomes a target.
- No.

142
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,769
That's the beauty of it. We never file papers.
We never name names.

143
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,328
It's just a powerful story.
Your witness is perfectly safe.

144
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,726
You're on board with this?

145
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,491
We've been on board, Jim.
Harvey's one of us.

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,445
I want what you want, Jim.

147
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,049
I want to make this city a better place.

148
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,802
No names. Not mine.
Not my witness. Nothing. Just a story.

149
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,480
Just a story.

150
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,040
All right. Let's try something.

151
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,409
BULLOCK: Thought I was gonna have to
work this without you. Where you been?

152
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,082
You know what? On second thought,
never mind, I don't want to know.

153
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,322
- What we got?
- A biggie.

154
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,047
Blackgate prisoner escaped
while in transit for psychiatric care.

155
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,802
Name's Ian Hargrove. Clinically insane,
with a compulsion for blowing things up.
