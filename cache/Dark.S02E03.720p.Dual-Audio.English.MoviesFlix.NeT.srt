1
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:12,796
I've seen you grow up.

2
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,130
Become a man.

3
00:00:21,296 --> 00:00:23,463
The whole cycle of your life.

4
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:26,213
Time chose you.

5
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:30,755
God chose you.

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,838
Don't forget
that we are your home now, too.

7
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:44,838
No harm will come to you.

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,338
We're watching over you.

9
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:52,546
Time is always with you.

10
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:55,671
Wherever you go.

11
00:00:56,838 --> 00:00:58,171
You carry it in you.

12
00:00:59,421 --> 00:01:00,463
And it carries you.

13
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:08,213
It sees and hears everything

14
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:11,005
that you do and say.

15
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,630
Claudia! Haven't you left yet?

16
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:38,171
I... I forgot the milk money.

17
00:03:39,505 --> 00:03:41,338
- But it's okay.
- Wait.

18
00:03:47,796 --> 00:03:49,380
Get yourself some fruit drops.

19
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,963
Thanks.

20
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:04,463
Do you think she noticed?

21
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,213
Don't worry.
Every family has its secrets.

22
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:19,546
Are you going somewhere?

23
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:21,921
Nowhere special.

24
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,755
Just some errands.

25
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:41,588
You're beautiful.

26
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:06,671
JUNE 23, 1954

27
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:11,130
FOUR DAYS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

28
00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:32,213
Helge.

29
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,380
And if we know that He listens
to what we ask for,

30
00:05:57,463 --> 00:06:00,255
we can be sure
that we have what we've asked of Him.

31
00:06:00,338 --> 00:06:03,880
Nothing is lost from His sight.
He returns all things.

32
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,338
POLICE

33
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:15,588
Seven months on and we still have no idea
who this monster is.

34
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:21,338
Why is he refusing to reveal his identity?

35
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:30,296
Why is no one looking for him?

36
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,338
It makes you wonder
how some people live.

37
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,338
Almost like ghosts.

38
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:38,546
Egon...

39
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,921
Can I ask you something?

40
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:55,130
Your wife and you,

41
00:06:56,338 --> 00:06:57,713
are things still...

42
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:00,421
Do you still have...

43
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:01,921
A lot?

44
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:05,963
No. At all.

45
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:08,213
Look at that.

46
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,630
I didn't think
they still made people like you.

47
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:20,421
Boy, Egon...

48
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,713
You've got to let off some steam.

49
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:31,588
Marriage isn't...

50
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:33,671
the way it's sold to us.

51
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:36,463
As soon as they have children

52
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,380
they become different people.

53
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:41,630
It's like they're married to the brats.

54
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,213
It's how nature wanted it.

55
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:46,171
But out there...

56
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:50,171
there are still loads
of tender buds to pluck.

57
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:54,130
They found him!

58
00:07:54,713 --> 00:07:55,755
Found who?

59
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,713
The Doppler boy.

60
00:07:57,796 --> 00:07:59,255
Helge Doppler?

61
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:01,171
- His body?
- No.

62
00:08:01,255 --> 00:08:02,671
The boy is alive.

63
00:08:02,755 --> 00:08:05,505
He just walked in the door
as if nothing had happened.

64
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,630
Do you like your mother?

65
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:16,546
Mine is peculiar sometimes.
She always acts like I don't get anything.

66
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:19,921
When I have kids I'll be different.

67
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:26,296
How come you never talk about
how it was where you're from?

68
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,255
Before you came to Winden?

69
00:08:29,713 --> 00:08:31,505
My mother was often sad.

70
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:33,921
I was in an orphanage for ages.

71
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:38,505
She doesn't like to talk about it,
so I don't, either.

72
00:08:38,588 --> 00:08:41,046
Don't you have any family
besides your mother?

73
00:08:41,713 --> 00:08:42,880
My mother has a brother.

74
00:08:44,255 --> 00:08:46,046
But I think they hate each other.

75
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:48,963
Do you think she's happy here?

76
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Will you show it to me now?

77
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:37,546
Where are those damn ghosts?

78
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:42,630
- Have you seen my book?
- What book?

79
00:09:42,713 --> 00:09:44,088
The Ghosts!

80
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,630
You don't have to gawp at me like that.
I know I'm late.

81
00:09:52,755 --> 00:09:55,130
- Did you put that there?
- No, I...

82
00:09:57,171 --> 00:09:59,213
I thought maybe...

83
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:02,463
Maybe you'd like to skip school
and we'll do something nice.

84
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:07,338
I don't know. I just thought we haven't
done anything together in so long.

85
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:12,630
I have a German exam today,
and I wanted to go to the lake later.

86
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:16,046
Maybe another time.

87
00:10:18,755 --> 00:10:19,880
Regina, wait.

88
00:10:35,963 --> 00:10:38,296
I like how you wear your hair now.

89
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:42,213
It makes you look so... grown up.

90
00:10:46,838 --> 00:10:47,671
Thanks.

91
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:53,921
I don't have any time. I have to go.

92
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,296
Time...

93
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:24,755
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME

94
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:33,338
FOR CLAUDIA FROM HELGE

95
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,588
Hello, Mrs. Doppler.

96
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:11,005
I've already told
your colleagues everything.

97
00:12:12,338 --> 00:12:14,755
I'd like to ask Helge a few questions.

98
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:18,213
He still hasn't said a single word.

99
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,171
Something is odd about the boy.

100
00:12:28,838 --> 00:12:30,255
It won't take long.

101
00:12:49,713 --> 00:12:50,796
Helge.

102
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:54,921
Remember me?

103
00:12:58,171 --> 00:12:59,671
I'm Claudia's father.

104
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:12,171
Won't you tell me
where you were all this time?

105
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:14,880
And with whom?

106
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,963
Who did that to you?

107
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:24,088
The inspector asked you something.

108
00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:28,505
Say something, for goodness sake!

109
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,255
I just wanted to see how you're doing.

110
00:13:47,213 --> 00:13:49,338
It may sound peculiar, but I...

111
00:13:54,463 --> 00:13:56,130
The book from last year.

112
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,421
- Why did you give it to me?
- I...

113
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,421
thought...

114
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:07,171
you may be the only one
who understands me.

115
00:14:12,338 --> 00:14:17,963
Time is always with you
wherever you go.

116
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,213
You carry it in you.

117
00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:23,546
And it carries you.

118
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,630
It sees and hears everything you do

119
00:14:26,713 --> 00:14:28,005
and say.

120
00:14:29,463 --> 00:14:30,713
What's that supposed to mean?

121
00:14:31,713 --> 00:14:33,046
He said...

122
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:38,963
it's a battle between good and evil,
between light and dark.

123
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:42,463
That the travelers can undo
everything that happens.

124
00:14:44,005 --> 00:14:47,630
If we succeed,  none of it will happen.

125
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Who said that?

126
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:51,338
Noah.

127
00:14:53,838 --> 00:14:55,171
Who is Noah?

128
00:14:57,921 --> 00:15:01,296
You mustn't trust him. Never! Do you hear?

129
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,171
Never!

130
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,463
Helge!

131
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,921
I'm sorry.

132
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,838
I didn't want all this.

133
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,630
Did anybody see you?

134
00:16:26,171 --> 00:16:28,421
They sent Helge back today.

135
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,171
Noah is back, too.

136
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:35,130
I'm not scared of him anymore.

137
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:37,963
You carry the same blood.

138
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:40,088
You can't choose your family.

139
00:16:40,171 --> 00:16:42,463
Renouncing your blood
means freeing yourself.

140
00:16:42,796 --> 00:16:43,963
You said so yourself.

141
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,088
Still, our family shapes us
our entire lives.

142
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:51,921
Sic Mundus...

143
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,713
They're preparing the next cycle.

144
00:16:56,963 --> 00:16:58,130
In four days.

145
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,838
Your brother is a blind fool.

146
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:05,463
All the suffering he causes people.

147
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:07,296
But it will have an end.

148
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,463
You must give me this.

149
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,088
Not now. There is still time.

150
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,713
Today?

151
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,171
I wanted to thank you.

152
00:17:38,213 --> 00:17:39,171
For everything.

153
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:47,546
My mother loves you, do you know that?

154
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:51,921
She will make you very happy
if you let her.

155
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:38,921
Are you HG Tannhaus?

156
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,588
Heterochromia.

157
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:47,255
One blue eye,

158
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:49,838
one brown.

159
00:18:56,171 --> 00:18:58,171
Did you write this book?

160
00:18:59,713 --> 00:19:02,338
I wondered when the day would come.

161
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,088
When we'd meet again.

162
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:09,755
I don't even know you.

163
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:12,713
But I know you.

164
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:16,963
A never-ending cycle.

165
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,046
Peculiar.

166
00:19:26,463 --> 00:19:27,838
And he didn't talk?

167
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:31,838
What do you make of it?

168
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,880
He just turns up out of nowhere.

169
00:19:35,713 --> 00:19:39,671
Maybe they are unrelated after all.

170
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:46,630
The madman who killed the children
and the Doppler boy.

171
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:48,588
How could he have done it?

172
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:51,088
He's been doing time for six months.

173
00:19:53,421 --> 00:19:54,921
Maybe he wasn't alone.

174
00:19:56,171 --> 00:19:57,921
You mean he has an accomplice?

175
00:19:59,171 --> 00:20:00,921
Visit the madman again.

176
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:04,380
Maybe he'll talk now.

177
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,380
An accomplice. Yes.

178
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,963
CLOSED PSYCHIATRIC WARD 3

179
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,755
I want to know what it all means.

180
00:20:38,463 --> 00:20:40,046
These lyrics.

181
00:20:41,046 --> 00:20:44,671
You said those words to me in 1953.

182
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:50,255
But this was only released last year.

183
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,171
You said...

184
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:03,880
you had a son yourself.

185
00:21:05,005 --> 00:21:07,338
Why did you murder the children?

186
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,713
I didn't murder the children.

187
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,380
I wanted to save them.

188
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:26,963
You said I was going to die.

189
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,838
How did you know I have cancer?

190
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,630
The White Devil?

191
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,546
Do you know who that is?

192
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:53,213
You're more deranged than I am.

193
00:21:59,713 --> 00:22:03,088
Why did you never tell us
what your name is?

194
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,296
Who you are?

195
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:11,505
Ulrich.

196
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:14,088
Ulrich Nielsen.

197
00:22:17,338 --> 00:22:19,296
And I come from the future.

198
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:25,088
I am what one calls a fraud.

199
00:22:29,963 --> 00:22:32,963
Have you ever heard 
of the bootstrap paradox?

200
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,380
No.

201
00:22:36,046 --> 00:22:38,505
In a bootstrap paradox,

202
00:22:39,463 --> 00:22:41,130
an object

203
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:43,338
or information

204
00:22:43,421 --> 00:22:47,630
from the future is sent back to the past.

205
00:22:47,713 --> 00:22:52,505
That creates a never-ending cycle

206
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:57,088
in which the object
no longer has any real origin.

207
00:22:57,171 --> 00:22:58,838
It exists

208
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,838
without ever having been created.

209
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:04,255
Put simply,

210
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,588
this book has traveled back in time.

211
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:12,005
It found me

212
00:23:12,088 --> 00:23:14,921
before I even wrote it.

213
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:18,838
It's all a question of origin.

214
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,296
Where is the beginning?
When is the beginning?

215
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,963
Is there a beginning at all?

216
00:23:28,338 --> 00:23:31,630
The world is full of such paradoxes.

217
00:23:31,713 --> 00:23:34,921
Only most of the time,
we choose to look away.

218
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:38,921
Good luck, but he doesn't talk.

219
00:23:39,588 --> 00:23:40,463
To anyone.

220
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,546
I don't think
you'll get anything out of him.

221
00:24:03,505 --> 00:24:04,505
Hello.

222
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,755
My name is Tiedemann.

223
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:13,921
Egon Tiedemann. Do you remember me?

224
00:24:14,546 --> 00:24:16,255
I arrested you last year.

225
00:24:18,296 --> 00:24:22,046
There are a few things
I'd like to ask you.

226
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,130
The Doppler boy is back home.

227
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,296
I want to know where Helge was.

228
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:38,255
Do you have an accomplice?

229
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:41,296
If you talk to me it...

230
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:44,296
might influence your situation here.

231
00:24:47,213 --> 00:24:48,838
It's his medication.

232
00:24:49,963 --> 00:24:51,296
We have to sedate him.

233
00:24:52,338 --> 00:24:55,005
Has he said what his name is yet?

234
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:57,588
Not to my knowledge.

235
00:25:21,963 --> 00:25:24,130
My name is Ulrich Nielsen.

236
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:25,546
MADS NIELSEN (12) MISSING

237
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,130
MADS NIELSEN CASE:
POLICE IN DARK

238
00:25:27,213 --> 00:25:29,005
WINDEN BOY VANISHES WITHOUT A TRACE

239
00:25:33,338 --> 00:25:36,046
REFERENCE FILE

240
00:25:38,796 --> 00:25:40,005
INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

241
00:25:40,088 --> 00:25:41,755
Name unknown.

242
00:25:42,338 --> 00:25:44,088
Age nine to 11.

243
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:47,671
Claims his father's name
is Ulrich Nielsen.

244
00:25:50,671 --> 00:25:52,546
Don't you want to tell me at last

245
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,588
why you're really here?

246
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,963
You want to know how it works.

247
00:25:58,546 --> 00:25:59,588
How did you know that?

248
00:26:00,671 --> 00:26:05,546
She told me
that you would turn up here one day

249
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,130
and that I should explain the device 
to you.

250
00:26:08,796 --> 00:26:09,880
That is,

251
00:26:10,421 --> 00:26:11,671
you, yourself.

252
00:26:12,046 --> 00:26:14,213
Your future self.

253
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,421
The paradox is that a short time ago
I wouldn't have been to explain it to you.

254
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:23,046
But last year

255
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,505
someone else explained it to me.

256
00:26:25,588 --> 00:26:27,005
Another...

257
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:29,588
time traveler.

258
00:26:30,963 --> 00:26:33,255
I think she knew it.

259
00:26:34,005 --> 00:26:37,213
She knew everything that would happen,

260
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:40,005
right up to the present moment.

261
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:43,296
She knew that you would show up here

262
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,838
for me to tell you,

263
00:26:44,921 --> 00:26:46,505
and therefore her,

264
00:26:47,588 --> 00:26:49,755
how the device works.

265
00:26:58,171 --> 00:26:59,963
I find him creepy.

266
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,630
As if he were empty inside now,
merely a husk.

267
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:10,755
He was never the brightest child,
but you could now believe he's mindless.

268
00:27:12,046 --> 00:27:13,755
He scares me.

269
00:27:14,838 --> 00:27:18,505
And without Bernd at home, I don't know 
how to deal with the situation.

270
00:27:19,755 --> 00:27:22,171
Perhaps the devil himself
has possessed him.

271
00:27:22,963 --> 00:27:26,588
Please look at him and tell me
everything is all right with him.

272
00:27:28,421 --> 00:27:30,380
And he hasn't said a word?

273
00:27:40,671 --> 00:27:43,505
Helge, come downstairs.
Someone wants to talk to you.

274
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,213
Time is always with you.

275
00:28:10,296 --> 00:28:11,963
Wherever you go.

276
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,963
You carry it in you.

277
00:28:15,046 --> 00:28:16,713
And it carries you.

278
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,755
It sees and hears everything
that you do and say.

279
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:27,671
Your mother is worried about you.

280
00:28:30,338 --> 00:28:32,963
Shall we show her she has no reason to be?

281
00:28:38,421 --> 00:28:40,505
I'd like you to read this for me.

282
00:28:42,338 --> 00:28:43,546
Will you do that?

283
00:28:46,838 --> 00:28:48,255
"You are my protection,

284
00:28:49,588 --> 00:28:50,630
my shield.

285
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,421
I hope for your word."

286
00:28:58,713 --> 00:29:00,046
He speaks!

287
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:04,421
Give him a little time.

288
00:29:05,338 --> 00:29:08,255
I'm sure he's just choosing his words
with great care.

289
00:29:10,255 --> 00:29:11,588
You can keep it.

290
00:29:12,796 --> 00:29:14,463
Won't you stay a while?

291
00:29:22,171 --> 00:29:23,838
He has returned.

292
00:29:28,296 --> 00:29:29,546
To your bosom.

293
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,921
He is a miracle.

294
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,921
Don't forget that.

295
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,713
So just what are you doing here?

296
00:29:49,296 --> 00:29:51,421
I'm merely trying

297
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:55,588
to fill in some gaps in a few old files.

298
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:57,671
Just to order things.

299
00:30:00,296 --> 00:30:02,380
I'd like to talk to the boy.

300
00:30:06,088 --> 00:30:07,421
Michael's asleep.

301
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,880
During the day?

302
00:30:10,546 --> 00:30:12,338
He wasn't feeling well.

303
00:30:12,421 --> 00:30:15,796
Has he ever said anything to you
about his parents?

304
00:30:19,713 --> 00:30:21,463
Michael wants to put that all behind him.

305
00:30:23,463 --> 00:30:24,921
He has a new life now.

306
00:30:32,088 --> 00:30:35,046
Has he ever mentioned their names to you?

307
00:30:36,255 --> 00:30:38,796
First names? Nicknames?

308
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,588
The name Ulrich?

309
00:30:44,671 --> 00:30:47,130
He hasn't mentioned that to you, either?

310
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,255
Has he ever...

311
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,546
talked about a "White Devil"?

312
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:05,963
No.

313
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,838
I don't understand
what the point of all these questions is.

314
00:31:11,838 --> 00:31:14,588
Perhaps I can talk to him tomorrow?

315
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:20,296
- Yes.
- Fine.

316
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,130
If anything else comes to mind,

317
00:31:25,213 --> 00:31:27,296
just give me a call.

318
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:32,880
All right.

319
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:48,546
SLEEPING PILLS

320
00:31:50,546 --> 00:31:52,005
I, um...

321
00:31:53,005 --> 00:31:55,046
I've been sleeping badly again.

322
00:31:56,796 --> 00:31:57,921
Nightmares.

323
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,463
One more thing.

324
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,130
Do you maybe have a photo of the boy?

325
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,380
Just for the files.

326
00:32:18,421 --> 00:32:19,880
Just for the files, right?

327
00:32:27,296 --> 00:32:29,046
Just for the files.

328
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,421
What do you want here?

329
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,880
Did Claudia send you?

330
00:33:08,505 --> 00:33:10,963
If you think Adam will let you back in,
you're wrong.

331
00:33:12,546 --> 00:33:13,838
You picked your side.

332
00:33:15,213 --> 00:33:17,171
There's no salvation for you.

333
00:33:21,588 --> 00:33:23,671
I know where the final pages are.

334
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:27,505
I also know
how long Adam's been looking for them.

335
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,755
Don't you think he'd do anything 
to get them?

336
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:33,130
I don't believe a word you say.

337
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,880
She would never have told you
where they are.

338
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,380
Claudia has them on her.

339
00:33:57,505 --> 00:34:00,255
In return, I want you to tell Adam
I want to come back.

340
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,671
Before the new cycle begins.

341
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:05,713
You're sacrificing her?

342
00:34:09,421 --> 00:34:12,546
You can't hate your own sister
the way you hate her.

343
00:34:23,588 --> 00:34:25,838
Consider it a peace offering.

344
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:01,213
Yes?

345
00:35:04,963 --> 00:35:07,046
There's someone here to see you.

346
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:09,171
All right.

347
00:35:12,421 --> 00:35:13,796
You can go in.

348
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,088
Can I help you?

349
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:47,088
One brown eye, one blue eye.

350
00:35:49,088 --> 00:35:50,338
That's rare.

351
00:35:51,755 --> 00:35:53,046
Like my daughter.

352
00:35:54,463 --> 00:35:56,588
You're too good a person.

353
00:35:58,046 --> 00:35:59,588
But you always have been.

354
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,255
The world doesn't deserve you.

355
00:36:09,005 --> 00:36:10,505
Excuse me, but...

356
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,171
do we know each other?

357
00:36:15,796 --> 00:36:18,171
I'm here
because I have to tell you something.

358
00:36:20,713 --> 00:36:22,213
I'm sorry.

359
00:36:26,463 --> 00:36:27,755
What are you sorry about?

360
00:36:29,546 --> 00:36:30,963
Everything.

361
00:36:33,296 --> 00:36:35,171
You don't deserve any of this.

362
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:42,588
But sometimes
the good ones get hit hardest.

363
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:48,755
I don't understand.

364
00:36:51,255 --> 00:36:53,421
You will one day.

365
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,296
And then I want you to know

366
00:36:58,463 --> 00:37:02,671
that I'm sorry that things turned out
the way they turned out.

367
00:37:08,213 --> 00:37:11,296
Either you tell me this instant
what this is all about

368
00:37:12,505 --> 00:37:14,463
or I'll ask you to leave immediately.

369
00:37:22,796 --> 00:37:24,713
I am sorry, I really am.

370
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,380
Ms. Tiedemann,
I've been trying to reach you all day.

371
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:53,755
The people from the press waited 
for over an hour.

372
00:37:54,546 --> 00:37:55,421
And...

373
00:37:56,255 --> 00:37:57,088
And?

374
00:37:57,546 --> 00:37:59,838
I postponed the meeting
till 10:30 tomorrow.

375
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:02,005
You meet the union reps after that.

376
00:38:06,338 --> 00:38:07,755
Cancel all appointments.

377
00:38:10,213 --> 00:38:12,255
And one more thing, your father...

378
00:38:13,713 --> 00:38:14,630
He's here.

379
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:18,880
I didn't know where to put him.

380
00:38:37,088 --> 00:38:38,630
What are you doing here?

381
00:38:39,505 --> 00:38:41,046
Why didn't you call first?

382
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:46,088
I wanted to talk to you.

383
00:38:46,671 --> 00:38:49,463
- It won't take long.
- This is really a bad time.

384
00:38:50,713 --> 00:38:52,463
You can just show up here.

385
00:38:52,796 --> 00:38:56,213
Why don't you make an appointment
with my secretary that suits us both?

386
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,046
- Next week, for example.
- I have cancer.

387
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:07,380
Prostate.

388
00:39:09,796 --> 00:39:12,005
I didn't want to upset you.

389
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,005
But now the cancer has spread.

390
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,963
And I thought

391
00:39:19,546 --> 00:39:21,838
it's best if you know that.

392
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:24,505
I...

393
00:39:28,671 --> 00:39:30,338
I don't know what to say.

394
00:39:31,296 --> 00:39:32,713
It's okay.

395
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:36,713
I just wanted you to know.

396
00:39:37,963 --> 00:39:39,671
I'll be on my way then.

397
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,796
I'm sure you have loads to do here.

398
00:39:47,463 --> 00:39:48,463
Dad.

399
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:18,671
- You're back!
- Hello, my precocious princess.

400
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:21,755
Where's Mom?

401
00:40:44,505 --> 00:40:45,880
You look sad.

402
00:40:50,255 --> 00:40:52,630
Can you keep a secret?

403
00:40:59,796 --> 00:41:01,921
I think I saw a witch today.

404
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:04,921
- There are no witches.
- There are!

405
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:06,755
This one was very real.

406
00:41:09,338 --> 00:41:10,963
How did she look?

407
00:41:12,505 --> 00:41:14,380
Long white hair.

408
00:41:15,046 --> 00:41:16,338
Like in books.

409
00:41:17,546 --> 00:41:18,713
And what did she say?

410
00:41:22,005 --> 00:41:24,255
That she was sorry.

411
00:41:26,588 --> 00:41:28,963
That doesn't sound like a witch.

412
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:34,046
How would you know?

413
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,255
You've never seen one.

414
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,755
Are those for Mom?

415
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:47,588
Yes.

416
00:41:51,088 --> 00:41:52,796
You're too good a person, Dad.

417
00:41:53,755 --> 00:41:55,463
The world doesn't deserve you.

418
00:42:05,505 --> 00:42:06,963
Everything okay?

419
00:42:11,088 --> 00:42:12,130
Yes.

420
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,088
It's just déjà vu.

421
00:42:17,546 --> 00:42:22,255
I used to think the worst thing
that could happen to a person in life

422
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,671
is to lose your own child.

423
00:42:27,046 --> 00:42:29,338
But we can't do anything about that.

424
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:35,921
No matter how hard we try
to hold on to them,

425
00:42:37,713 --> 00:42:40,838
they still leave, sooner or later.

426
00:42:41,796 --> 00:42:43,046
Parents...

427
00:42:43,796 --> 00:42:45,005
Children...

428
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:51,046
They only share a common path
for a part of their lives.

429
00:42:52,171 --> 00:42:53,380
In the end...

430
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:57,005
they are miles away from one another.

431
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:06,630
Last winter

432
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:10,546
a boy came to Winden.

433
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,588
A stranger.

434
00:43:13,588 --> 00:43:17,588
He said something peculiar to me
at the time.

435
00:43:17,671 --> 00:43:19,505
It makes no sense, but...

436
00:43:21,755 --> 00:43:25,505
Maybe my cancer
is already driving me crazy.

437
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,880
Do you know this boy?

438
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,338
He's here?

439
00:43:48,088 --> 00:43:51,963
Where is he?
You knew he was here?

440
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,505
You knew the whole time?

441
00:43:55,421 --> 00:43:57,255
Where is he? Where is he?

442
00:44:10,296 --> 00:44:11,921
Let go of me!

443
00:44:12,588 --> 00:44:13,921
Where is Mikkel?

444
00:44:20,588 --> 00:44:21,630
I'm closed for the day.

445
00:44:26,713 --> 00:44:27,880
It's you!

446
00:44:27,963 --> 00:44:28,963
I...

447
00:44:29,588 --> 00:44:31,796
It's not ready yet.

448
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:36,005
It'll take another 33 years
before it's ready.

449
00:44:36,088 --> 00:44:38,171
This thing... The blueprint...

450
00:44:38,796 --> 00:44:40,130
I don't really understand what it is.

451
00:44:49,046 --> 00:44:50,463
I've seen this before.

452
00:44:52,588 --> 00:44:55,296
All our lives
we wonder what our journey will be.

453
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,546
This is yours.

454
00:44:58,338 --> 00:45:00,963
- Keep it. I don't need it anymore.
- Why are you giving it to me?

455
00:45:02,921 --> 00:45:04,671
I'll be dead soon.

456
00:45:05,546 --> 00:45:07,713
I don't understand.

457
00:45:08,713 --> 00:45:09,838
You will.

458
00:45:10,963 --> 00:45:12,130
One day.

459
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,713
And then we'll meet again.

460
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,755
Before you die.

461
00:45:19,005 --> 00:45:20,546
No. After that.

462
00:45:21,713 --> 00:45:22,921
How...

463
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:25,338
How can that be possible?

464
00:45:26,213 --> 00:45:28,130
Time is just an illusion.

465
00:45:29,463 --> 00:45:31,588
Then you'll have to explain
the device to me.

466
00:45:31,671 --> 00:45:35,296
But I don't know what it's for.
Why don't you tell me what it's for?

467
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:38,713
Because you told me
someone else explained it to you.

468
00:45:39,421 --> 00:45:41,963
Things take their course,
as they always have.

469
00:45:43,421 --> 00:45:46,713
No, I didn't tell you anything.
No one explained anything to me.

470
00:45:47,421 --> 00:45:50,588
Not now, but in the future.

471
00:45:51,171 --> 00:45:53,338
All this will come to an end soon.

472
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:57,630
But until then everything must remain
as it always has been.

473
00:45:59,296 --> 00:46:01,505
Wait. Please.

474
00:48:00,046 --> 00:48:01,963
You thought you could trust her.

475
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,046
She betrayed you.

476
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,588
She didn't even bat an eyelid.

477
00:48:15,046 --> 00:48:16,671
You took everything from me.

478
00:48:17,755 --> 00:48:18,838
You're going to die!

479
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:21,671
And everything you stand for
will die with you.

480
00:48:23,046 --> 00:48:25,255
I know that I am going to die.

481
00:48:26,796 --> 00:48:29,005
But am I going to lose this match?

482
00:48:29,463 --> 00:48:33,088
Or is this here, our meeting,
you and your gun,

483
00:48:33,921 --> 00:48:37,463
only part of a game
you still don't know how to play.

484
00:48:37,546 --> 00:48:40,796
You think you can manipulate me
with your words.

485
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,296
I'm no longer one of your pawns.

486
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,755
But you're still one of Adam's.

487
00:48:50,088 --> 00:48:53,963
The paradise he's promising you
is nothing but a lie.

488
00:48:54,546 --> 00:48:57,463
He's selling you the illusion of freedom.

489
00:48:58,296 --> 00:49:01,213
Ask yourself if you are really free.

490
00:49:01,588 --> 00:49:03,546
If you were really free,

491
00:49:05,088 --> 00:49:06,796
you'd have a choice.

492
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,921
Do you have a choice?

493
00:49:52,421 --> 00:49:56,671
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN'S BODY
FOUND IN WOODS

494
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:41,046
That can't be.

495
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:47,338
Charlotte?

496
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:49,171
That's not...

497
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,630
No, this isn't right.

498
00:50:52,255 --> 00:50:53,713
This isn't true.

499
00:51:17,505 --> 00:51:20,671
No matter how much we want to fight it,

500
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,338
we are connected through our blood.

501
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:35,755
We can be alienated from our families
and not understand their actions.

502
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:42,796
Still, in the end,
we would do anything for them.

503
00:51:47,005 --> 00:51:48,505
A common thread

504
00:51:49,713 --> 00:51:53,880
that connects all of our lives
with each other.

505
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,713
Did she have the pages on her?

506
00:52:15,755 --> 00:52:18,213
She got what she deserved.

507
00:52:22,963 --> 00:52:27,463
In the end, we all get what we deserve.
