1
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,273
Master Kaecilius.

2
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:33,245
That ritual will bring you only sorrow.

3
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,447
Hypocrite!

4
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,190
Challenge round, Billy.

5
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,275
Oh, come on, Billy,
you've got to be messing with me.

6
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,777
No, doctor.

7
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,863
<i>Feels So Good,</i> Chuck Mangione, 1977.

8
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,658
Honestly, Billy,
you said this one would be hard.

9
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,739
- It's 1978.
- No, Billy.

10
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,412
While <i>Feels So Good</i>
may have charted in 1978...

11
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,954
the album was released
in December of 1977.

12
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,689
No. Wikipedia says it's a nineteen...

13
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:31,815
Check again.

14
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,212
Where do you store
all this useless information?

15
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,293
Useless?

16
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,300
The man charted a top 10 hit
with a flugelhorn.

17
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,130
Status, Billy?

18
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,298
1977.

19
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,901
- Oh, please.
- I hate you.

20
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,974
Feels so good, doesn't it?

21
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,125
Oh, I got this, Stephen.

22
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,102
You've done your bit.
Go ahead. We'll close up.

23
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,171
What is it?

24
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,443
GSW.

25
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,053
It's amazing you kept him alive.

26
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,671
Apneic, failed the brain stem test...

27
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,118
and the apnea reflex test.

28
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,830
I think I found the problem,
Doctor Palmer.

29
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,574
You left a bullet in his head.

30
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,370
Thanks. It's impinging on the medulla.

31
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,853
I needed a specialist.
Nic diagnosed brain death.

32
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,708
Something about that
doesn't feel right to me.

33
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,789
We have to run.

34
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,333
Doctor West.

35
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,836
What are you doing? Hey.

36
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,337
Organ harvest. He's a donor.

37
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,133
Slow down. I did not agree to that.

38
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,135
I don't need you to.
We've already called brain death.

39
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,261
Prematurely.
We need to get him prepped

40
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,501
for sub-occipital craniotomy.

41
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,303
Not gonna let you operate
on a dead man.

42
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:27,847
What do you see?

43
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,897
- A bullet?
- A perfect bullet.

44
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,940
It's been hardened. You harden a bullet
by alloying lead with antimony.

45
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,651
A toxic metal. And that's leeched
directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.

46
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,443
Rapid onset central
nervous system shutdown.

47
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,524
We gotta go.

48
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,112
The patient's not dead, but he is dying.

49
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,614
Still want to harvest his organs?

50
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,180
- I'll assist you.
- No.

51
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,157
Doctor Palmer will assist me.

52
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,974
Thank you.

53
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,225
Image guidance, stat.

54
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,893
We don't have time for that.

55
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,686
You can't do it freehand.

56
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,021
I can and I will.

57
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,951
This isn't a time
for showing off, Strange.

58
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,174
How about 10 minutes ago

59
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,868
when you called
the wrong time of death?

60
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,421
<i>Cranial nerves intact.</i>

61
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,739
Doctor West, cover your watch.

62
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,072
You know, you didn't have to
humiliate him in front of everyone.

63
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,657
I didn't have to save his patient, either.

64
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,431
But I sometimes just can't help myself.

65
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,891
Nic is a great doctor.

66
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,142
You came to me.

67
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,622
Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.

68
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,770
You had a second opinion.

69
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,291
What you needed was a competent one.

70
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,439
Well, all the more reason

71
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,585
why you should be
my neurosurgeon on call.

72
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,108
You could make such a difference.

73
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,777
I can't work in your butcher shop.

74
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:04,945
Hey!

75
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,132
I'm fusing transected spinal cords.

76
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,385
I'm stimulating neurogenesis
in the central nervous system.

77
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,762
The work I'm doing is gonna save
thousands for years to come.

78
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,244
In ER, you get to save
one drunk idiot with a gun.

79
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,371
Yeah, you're right.

80
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,914
In ER, we're only saving lives.

81
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,791
There's no fame, there's no,

82
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,542
CNN interviews.

83
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,503
I guess I'll just have to stick with Nic.

84
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:22,629
Wait a minute.

85
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,984
You're not... You guys aren't...

86
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,298
What?

87
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,134
Sleeping together? Sorry, I thought
that was implicit in my disgust.

88
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,761
Explicit, actually.

89
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,097
No, I have a very strict rule
against dating colleagues.

90
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,181
Oh, really?

91
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,369
I call it the "Strange Policy."

92
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,998
Oh, well, good, I'm glad
something's named after me.

93
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,420
I invented a laminectomy procedure.

94
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,335
And yet, somehow no one seems to want
to call it the "Strange Technique."

95
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,917
We invented that technique.

96
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,503
Regardless, I'm very flattered
by your policy.

97
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,849
I'm talking tonight
at a Neurological Society dinner.

98
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,260
Come with me.

99
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,120
Another speaking engagement?

100
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,221
So romantic.

101
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,226
You used to love coming
to those things with me.

102
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,541
We had fun together.

103
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,292
No! You had fun.

104
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,190
They weren't about us,
they were about you.

105
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,356
Not only about me.

106
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,449
Stephen. Everything is about you.

107
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,944
Maybe we could hyphenate.

108
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,113
Strange-Palmer Technique.

109
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,077
Palmer-Strange.

110
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,418
Billy.

111
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,732
What have you got for me?

112
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,420
<i>I've got a 35-year-old
Air Force Colonel...</i>

113
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,361
<i>crushed his lower spine
in some kind of experimental armor.</i>

114
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,838
<i>Mid-thoracic burst fracture.</i>

115
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,389
Yeah, well, I could help...

116
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,791
but so could 50 other people.

117
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,309
Find me something worth my time.

118
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,767
<i>I have a 68-year-old female
with an advanced brain stem glioma.</i>

119
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,599
Yeah, you want me to screw up
my perfect record?

120
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,125
Definitely not.

121
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,545
<i>How about a 22-year-old female...</i>

122
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,817
<i>with an electronic implant in her brain
to control schizophrenia...</i>

123
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,090
<i>struck by lightning?</i>

124
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,737
That does sound interesting.

125
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,031
Can you send me the...

126
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,954
Got it.

127
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,759
Hey.

128
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,559
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

129
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,575
What did they do?

130
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,016
They rushed you in a chopper.

131
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,210
But it took a little while to find you.

132
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,439
The golden hours for nerve damage
went by while you were in the car.

133
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,213
What did they do?

134
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,089
11 stainless steel pins in the bones.

135
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,141
Multiple torn ligaments...

136
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,312
severe nerve damage in both hands.

137
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,790
You were on the table for 11 hours.

138
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,813
Look at these fixators.

139
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,404
No one could have done better.

140
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,746
I could have done better.

141
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,351
No.

142
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,107
Give your body time to heal.

143
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,523
You've ruined me.

144
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,029
How long until I can take...

145
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,177
Doctor Strange.

146
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,887
Those tissues are still healing.

147
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,034
So, speed it up.

148
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,874
Pass a stent down the brachial artery
into the radial artery.

149
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,951
It's possible.

150
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,002
Experimental and expensive,
but possible.

151
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,004
All I need is possible.

152
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,565
<i>Up.</i>

153
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,026
Up.

154
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,529
Show me your strength.

155
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,335
This is useless.

156
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,581
It's not useless, man. You can do this.

157
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,092
All right, answer me this,
bachelor's degree.

158
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,820
Have you ever known anyone
with nerve damage

159
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,513
this severe to do this...

160
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:23,823
and actually recover?

161
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,450
One guy, yeah.

162
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,994
Factory accident, broke his back...

163
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,517
paralyzed, his leg wasted away.

164
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,831
He had pain in his shoulder,

165
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,932
from the wheelchair.

166
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,568
He came in three times a week.

167
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,925
Then one day he stopped coming.

168
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,921
I thought he was dead.

169
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,115
A few years later, he walked
past me on the street.

170
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,675
- Walked?
- Yeah, walked.

171
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,654
Bullshit.
Show me his file.

172
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,431
It'll take me a while to
pull the files from the archive.

173
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,954
But if it proves
your arrogant ass wrong...

174
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,706
Worth it.

175
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,619
<i>I looked at all your research...</i>

176
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,938
<i>I read all the papers you've sent.</i>

177
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,814
<i>It's not gonna work.</i>

178
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,458
<i>I don't think you realize...</i>

179
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,044
<i>- how severe the damages are.</i>
- Here's the thing...

180
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,384
<i>The best have tried and failed.</i>

181
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,152
I understand. Here's the thing.

182
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,363
<i>What you want from me
is impossible, Stephen.</i>

183
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:25,735
Come on.

184
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,575
<i>I've got my own reputation to consider.</i>

185
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,455
- Etienne, wait. No.
<i>- I can't help you.</i>

186
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,057
No, no, wait!

187
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,997
Hey!

188
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,967
He won't do it.

189
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:49,930
He's a hack.

190
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,578
There is a new procedure in Tokyo.

191
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,163
They culture donor stem cells...

192
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,480
and then harvesting them

193
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,999
and then 3D printing a scaffold.

194
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,271
If I could get a loan together...

195
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,352
Stephen.

196
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,066
A small loan, just $200,000.

197
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,234
You've always spent money
as fast as you could make it...

198
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,362
but now you're spending money
you don't even have.

199
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,153
Maybe it's time to consider stopping.

200
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,619
No, now is exactly the time not to stop...

201
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,455
because, you see,
I'm not getting any better!

202
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,457
But this isn't medicine anymore.

203
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,295
This is mania.

204
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,040
Some things just can't be fixed.

205
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,668
- Life without my work...
- Is still life.

206
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:24,861
This isn't the end.

207
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,840
There are other things that
can give your life meaning.

208
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,723
Like what? Like you?

209
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,474
This is the part where you apologize.

210
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,438
This is the part where you leave.

211
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,980
Fine, I can't watch you
do this to yourself anymore.

212
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,588
Oh, too difficult for you, is it?

213
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,654
Yes, it is.

214
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,986
It breaks my heart to see you this way.

215
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,234
- No, don't pity me.
- I'm not pitying you.

216
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,655
Oh, yeah?
Then what are you doing here...

217
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,991
bringing cheese and wine
like we're old friends going for a picnic?

218
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,323
We are not friends, Christine.

219
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,724
We were barely lovers.

220
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,667
But you just love a sob story, don't you?

221
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,123
Is that what I am to you now?

222
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,872
"Poor Stephen Strange, charity case."

223
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,064
"He finally needs me."

224
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,878
Another dreg of humanity
for you to work on.

225
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,319
Patch him up and send him
back into the world...

226
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,904
heart's just humming.

227
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:11,349
You care so much, don't you?

228
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,847
Goodbye, Stephen.

229
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,588
All the way. Here we go.

230
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,632
Let's go! All day! All day!

231
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,736
Yeah! All day.

232
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,423
Come on, man!
Where's the competition?

233
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,582
Talk a lot.

234
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:20,935
Jonathan Pangborn...

235
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,959
C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete.

236
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,648
Who are you?

237
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:26,919
Paralyzed from the mid-chest down.

238
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,546
Partial paralysis in both hands.

239
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,761
- I don't know you.
- I'm Stephen Strange.

240
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,931
I'm a neurosurgeon.
Was a neurosurgeon.

241
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,639
Actually, you know what, man,
I do know you.

242
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:40,521
I came to your office once.
You refused to see me.

243
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,102
I never got past your assistant.

244
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,276
You were untreatable.

245
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,770
No glory for you in that, right?

246
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,025
You came back from a place
there's no way back from.

247
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,698
I'm trying to
find my own way back.

248
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,711
Pangborn, are you in or you out?

249
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,303
All right.

250
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,595
I'd given up on my body.

251
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,053
I thought my mind's
the only thing I have left...

252
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,012
I should at least try to elevate that.

253
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,639
So, I sat with gurus...

254
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,433
and sacred women.

255
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,478
Strangers carried me to
mountaintops to see holy men.

256
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,645
And finally...

257
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,482
I found my teacher.

258
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,151
And my mind was elevated...

259
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,489
and my spirit deepened.

260
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,446
And somehow...

261
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,613
Your body healed.

262
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:40,823
Yes.

263
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,459
There were deeper secrets
to learn there...

264
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,374
but I didn't have the strength
to receive them.

265
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:49,253
I chose to settle for my miracle
and I came back home.

266
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,723
The place you're looking for
is called Kamar-Taj.

267
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,134
But the cost there is high.

268
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,118
How much?

269
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,891
I'm not talking about money.

270
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,357
Good luck.

271
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,648
Let's ball. All right, ball up!

272
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,883
Kamar-Taj?

273
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,628
You know where Kamar-Taj is?

274
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,078
Kamar-Taj?

275
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,914
Kamar-Taj.

276
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,485
Okay.

277
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,107
Look, guys, I don't have any money.

278
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:39,863
Your watch.

279
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,154
No, please. It's all I have left.

280
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,367
Your watch.

281
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,958
All right.

282
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,331
You're looking for Kamar-Taj.

283
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,192
Really?

284
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,281
Sure we got the right place?

285
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:09,532
That one looks
a little more Kamar-Tajey.

286
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:14,086
I once stood in your place.

287
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,670
And I, too, was disrespectful.

288
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,048
So, might I offer you some advice?

289
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,423
Forget everything you think you know.

290
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,434
All right.

291
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,029
The sanctuary of our teacher.

292
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,235
The Ancient One.

293
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,174
The Ancient One?

294
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,400
What's his real name?

295
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,112
Right.

296
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,747
Forget everything I think I know. Sorry.

297
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,294
Um, thank you for...

298
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,635
Okay, that's a thing.

299
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,929
Thank you for...

300
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,135
Hello.

301
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,474
Oh, thank you.

302
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,439
And thank you.

303
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,562
Thank you...

304
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:20,444
Ancient One, for seeing me.

305
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,604
You're very welcome.

306
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:26,321
The Ancient One.

307
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,327
Thank you, Master Mordo.
Thank you, Master Hamir.

308
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,072
Mr. Strange.

309
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,328
Doctor, actually.

310
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,959
Well, no, not anymore, surely.

311
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,210
Isn't that why you're here?

312
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,793
You've undergone many procedures.

313
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,216
- Seven, right?
- Yeah.

314
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,960
It's good tea.

315
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,295
Yes.

316
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,306
Did you heal a man named Pangborn?

317
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,511
A paralyzed man?

318
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,683
In a way.

319
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,748
You helped him to walk again.

320
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:58,974
Yes.

321
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,691
How did you correct a complete
C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

322
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,651
Well, I didn't correct it.

323
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,115
He couldn't walk.

324
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,616
I convinced him that he could.

325
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,677
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

326
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,745
When you reattach a severed nerve...

327
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,264
is it you who heals it
back together or the body?

328
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,365
It's the cells.

329
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,017
The cells are only programmed...

330
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,206
to put themselves back together
in very specific ways.

331
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,229
Right.

332
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,832
What if I told you that
your own body could be convinced...

333
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,169
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

334
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,343
You're talking about
cellular regeneration.

335
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,679
That's bleeding edge medical tech.

336
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,684
Is that why you're working here?

337
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,058
Without a governing medical board?

338
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,106
Just how experimental
is your treatment?

339
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,183
Quite.

340
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,961
So, you've figured out a way...

341
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,359
to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

342
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,903
No, Mr. Strange.

343
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,406
I know how to reorient the spirit...

344
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,196
to better heal the body.

345
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,705
- The spirit to heal the body?
- That's right.

346
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,830
No. All right.

347
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:03,997
How do we do that?

348
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,674
Where do we start?

349
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,181
- Don't like that map?
- Oh, no.

350
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:16,431
It's really good. It's just,
I've seen it before...

351
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:17,804
in gift shops.

352
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:20,935
And what about this one?

353
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,566
- Acupuncture, great.
- Yeah?

354
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,691
What about that one?

355
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,569
Showing me an MRI scan.
I do not believe this.

356
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,242
Each of those maps
was drawn up by someone...

357
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,029
who could see in part, but not the whole.

358
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,534
I spent my last dollar getting here,
one-way ticket...

359
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,834
and you're talking to me
about healing through belief?

360
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,420
You're a man looking at the world
through a keyhole.

361
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,189
You've spent your whole life

362
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,376
trying to widen that keyhole...

363
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,083
to see more, to know more.

364
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,261
Now, on hearing that it can be widened...

365
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,263
in ways you can't imagine...

366
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,924
you reject the possibility.

367
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,513
No, I reject it because
I do not believe in fairy tales...

368
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,266
about chakras or energy...

369
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,013
or the power of belief.

370
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,186
There is no such thing as spirit!

371
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,811
We are made of matter
and nothing more.

372
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,151
You're just another tiny,
momentary speck

373
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,569
within an indifferent universe.

374
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,275
You think too little of yourself.

375
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,469
Oh, you think
you see through me, do you?

376
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:16,661
Well, you don't.

377
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,619
But I see through you!

378
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,721
What did you just do to me?

379
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,974
I pushed your astral form
out of your physical form.

380
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,663
What's in that tea?

381
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,481
Psilocybin? LSD?

382
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,250
It's just tea...

383
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,397
with a little honey.

384
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,190
What just happened?

385
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,672
For a moment, you entered
the astral dimension.

386
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:52,773
The what?

387
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,905
A place where the soul exists
apart from the body.

388
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,907
Why are you doing this to me?

389
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,493
To show you
just how much you don't know.

390
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,623
Open your eye.

391
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,957
Oh, shit!

392
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,501
Oh, God! Oh, God, no!

393
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,045
No, no, no!

394
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,212
What's happening?

395
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,473
This isn't real!

396
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:31,027
<i>His heart rate
is getting dangerously high.</i>

397
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,363
He looks all right to me.

398
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,702
<i>You think
you know how the world works?</i>

399
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:46,084
<i>You think that this material universe
is all there is?</i>

400
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,882
<i>What is real?</i>

401
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,596
<i>What mysteries lie beyond
the reach of your senses?</i>

402
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,100
<i>At the root of existence...</i>

403
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,354
<i>mind and matter meet.</i>

404
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,390
<i>Thoughts shape reality.</i>

405
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,998
<i>This universe is only one
of an infinite number.</i>

406
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,745
<i>Worlds without end.</i>

407
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,957
<i>Some benevolent and life giving.</i>

408
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:39,592
<i>Others filled with malice and hunger.</i>

409
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,467
<i>Dark places...</i>

410
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:48,434
<i>where powers older than time
lie ravenous...</i>

411
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,354
<i>and waiting.</i>

412
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:05,202
<i>Who are you
in this vast Multiverse, Mr. Strange?</i>

413
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:28,387
Have you seen
that before in a gift shop?

414
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,607
Teach me.

415
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,361
No.

416
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,180
No.

417
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,281
No!

418
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,496
No, no, no!

419
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:53,729
No!

420
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,127
Open the door! Please!

421
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,678
Thank you, Masters.

422
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,143
You think I was wrong to cast him out?

423
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,599
5 hours later,
he's still on your doorstep.

424
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,398
There's a strength to him.

425
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:16,168
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition.

426
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,941
I've seen it all before.

427
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,131
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

428
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:24,051
I cannot lead another
gifted student to power...

429
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,404
only to lose him to the darkness.

430
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,865
You didn't lose me.

431
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,517
I wanted the power
to defeat my enemies.

432
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,247
You gave me the power
to defeat my demons.

433
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:39,292
And to live within the natural law.

434
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,569
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

435
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,717
We only learn to live above them.

436
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,178
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

437
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,621
If he deciphers them,
he could bring ruin...

438
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,143
upon us all.

439
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:56,983
There may be dark days ahead.

440
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,855
Perhaps Kamar-Taj
could use a man like Strange.

441
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,782
Don't shut me out.

442
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,664
I haven't got anywhere else to go.

443
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:23,585
Thank you.

444
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:29,971
Bathe.

445
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,309
Rest.

446
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,638
Meditate...

447
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,647
if you can.

448
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,854
The Ancient One will send for you.

449
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,947
What's this? My mantra?

450
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,285
The Wi-Fi password.

451
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,496
We're not savages.

452
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,988
<i>The language
of the mystic arts...</i>

453
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,653
<i>is as old as civilization.</i>

454
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,198
The sorcerers of antiquity...

455
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,166
called the use of this language "spells."

456
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,331
But if that word offends
your modern sensibilities...

457
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,914
you can call it a "program."

458
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:45,091
The source code that shapes reality.

459
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,047
We harness energy...

460
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,679
drawn from other dimensions
of the Multiverse...

461
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,761
to cast spells...

462
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,981
to conjure shields...

463
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,024
and weapons...

464
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,190
to make magic.

465
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:22,080
But even if my fingers could do that...

466
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,837
my hands would just be
waving in the air.

467
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,089
How do I get from here to there?

468
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,696
How did you get
to reattach severed nerves...

469
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,390
and put a human spine
back together bone by bone?

470
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,977
Study and practice, years of it.

471
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,561
Hey.

472
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,616
Mr. Strange.

473
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,652
Stephen, please.

474
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,904
- And you are?
- Wong.

475
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,246
Wong.

476
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,158
Just Wong?

477
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,997
Like Adele?

478
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,579
Or Aristotle.

479
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,339
Drake.

480
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:08,796
Bono.

481
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,253
Eminem.

482
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,510
<i>The Book of the Invisible Sun.</i>

483
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,929
<i>Astronomia Nova.</i>

484
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,643
<i>Codex Imperium.</i>

485
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,649
<i>Key of Solomon.</i>

486
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,232
You finished all of these?

487
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,562
Yup.

488
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,318
Come with me.

489
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,531
All right.

490
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,485
This section
is for masters only...

491
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,030
but at my discretion, others may use it.

492
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,624
You should start with Maxim's Primer.

493
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,038
How's your Sanskrit?

494
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:50,126
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

495
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,007
Vedic, classical Sanskrit.

496
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,007
What are those?

497
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,769
The Ancient One's
private collection.

498
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,145
So, they're forbidden?

499
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,815
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj
is forbidden.

500
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,772
Only certain practices.

501
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,587
Those books are far too advanced

502
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,781
for anyone other than
the Sorcerer Supreme.

503
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,836
This one's got pages missing.

504
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,290
That's <i>The Book of Cagliostro.</i>

505
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,129
A study of time.

506
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:34,086
One of the rituals was stolen
by a former master.

507
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,889
The Zealot, Kaecilius.

508
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:41,927
Just after he strung up
the former librarian...

509
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,516
and relieved him of his head.

510
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,059
I am now the guardian of these books.

511
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:52,859
So if a volume from this collection
should be stolen again...

512
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,360
I'd know it...

513
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,738
and you'd be dead before
you ever left the compound.

514
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,535
What if it's just overdue?

515
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,905
Any late fees I should know about?
Maiming, perhaps?

516
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,540
People used to think that I was funny.

517
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,924
Did they work for you?

518
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,218
All right. Well, it's been
lovely talking to you.

519
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,113
Thank you for the books...

520
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,407
and for the horrifying story...

521
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,350
and for the threat upon my life.

522
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,424
We will now receive the power

523
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,419
to destroy the one who betrayed us.

524
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,098
The one who betrays the world.

525
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:05,282
Mastery of the sling ring
is essential to the mystic arts.

526
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,948
They allow us to travel
throughout the Multiverse.

527
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,492
All you need to do is focus.

528
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,543
Visualize.

529
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,960
See the destination in your mind.

530
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,130
Look beyond the world in front of you.

531
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,136
Imagine every detail.

532
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:27,392
The clearer the picture,
the quicker and easier...

533
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,852
the gateway will come.

534
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,582
And stop.

535
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,310
I would like a moment alone
with Mr. Strange.

536
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,111
Of course.

537
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,509
My hands.

538
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:45,781
It's not about your hands.

539
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,995
How is this not about my hands?

540
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:49,656
Master Hamir.

541
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,468
Thank you, Master Hamir.

542
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,600
You cannot beat a river into submission.

543
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,640
You have to surrender to its current...

544
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,056
and use its power as your own.

545
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,374
I control it by surrendering control?

546
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,896
That doesn't make any sense.

547
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,440
Not everything does.
Not everything has to.

548
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,690
Your intellect has
taken you far in life...

549
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,324
but it will take you no further.

550
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,819
Surrender, Stephen.

551
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,029
Silence your ego...

552
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,198
and your power will rise.

553
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,250
Come with me.

554
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,440
Wait.

555
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,508
- Is this...
- Everest.

556
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,111
Beautiful.

557
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,760
Yeah, right, beautiful.

558
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,345
Freezing but beautiful.

559
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,784
At this temperature...

560
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,995
a person can last for 30 minutes...

561
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,689
before suffering permanent
loss of function.

562
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:57,916
Great.

563
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,485
But you'll likely go into shock
within the first two.

564
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,897
- What?
- Surrender, Stephen.

565
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,110
No!

566
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,109
How's our new recruit?

567
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,248
We shall see.

568
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,755
Any second now.

569
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,132
Oh, no, not again.

570
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:30,465
Maybe I should...

571
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:45,711
Stephen.

572
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:46,941
Wong.

573
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,004
What do you want, Strange?

574
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,506
Books on astral projection.

575
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:51,592
You're not ready for that.

576
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,011
Try me, Beyoncé.

577
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,453
Oh, come on. You've heard of her.

578
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,930
She's a huge star, right?

579
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:03,899
Do you ever laugh?

580
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,770
Oh, come on, just give me the book.

581
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:08,904
No.

582
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,992
<i>Once, in this room,</i>

583
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,436
<i>you begged me to let you learn.</i>

584
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,414
Now, I'm told
you question every lesson...

585
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,107
preferring to teach yourself.

586
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,105
Once, in this room,
you told me to open my eye.

587
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,108
Now, I'm being told
to blindly accept rules...

588
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:50,609
that make no sense.

589
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,737
Like the rule against
conjuring a gateway in the library?

590
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,360
Wong told on me?

591
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,012
You're advancing quickly
with your sorcery skills.

592
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,786
You need a safe space
to practice your spells.

593
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,260
You are now inside
the Mirror Dimension...

594
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:24,097
ever present but undetected.

595
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,307
The real world isn't affected
by what happens here.

596
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:31,441
We use the Mirror Dimension
to train, surveil...

597
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,549
and sometimes to contain threats.

598
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:36,889
You don't wanna be stuck in here
without your sling ring.

599
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,703
Hold on. Sorry.
What do you mean, "threats?"

600
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:53,468
Learning of an infinite Multiverse
includes learning of infinite dangers.

601
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,737
If I told you everything else
that you don't already know...

602
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,384
you'd run from here in terror.

603
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,851
So just how ancient is she?

604
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,561
No one knows the age
of the Sorcerer Supreme.

605
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,524
Only that she's Celtic
and never talks about her past.

606
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,508
You follow her, even though
you don't know?

607
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,655
I know she's steadfast...

608
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,281
but unpredictable.

609
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,741
Merciless, yet kind.

610
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,374
She made me what I am.

611
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,377
Trust your teacher...

612
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,250
and don't lose your way.

613
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:31,539
Like Kaecilius?

614
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:32,957
That's right.

615
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,922
You knew him.

616
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,252
When he first came to us...

617
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,559
he'd lost everyone he ever loved.

618
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,538
He was a grieving, broken man
searching for answers in the mystic arts.

619
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:51,542
A brilliant student,
but he was proud, headstrong.

620
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,722
He questioned the Ancient One,
rejected her teaching.

621
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,137
He left Kamar-Taj.

622
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,765
His disciples followed him like sheep.

623
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,808
Seduced by false doctrine.

624
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,311
And he stole the forbidden ritual, right?

625
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:11,412
Yes.

626
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:12,751
What did it do?

627
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,425
No more questions.

628
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:18,986
What's that?

629
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,338
That's a question.

630
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,932
This is a relic.

631
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,934
Some magic is too powerful to sustain...

632
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,293
so we imbue objects with it...

633
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:30,565
allowing them
to take the strain we cannot.

634
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:33,609
This is the staff...

635
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,402
of the Living Tribunal.

636
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,316
There are many relics.

637
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,280
The Wand of Watoomb.

638
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,908
The Vaulting Boots of Valtorr.

639
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,906
Really just roll off
the tongue, don't they?

640
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,665
- When do I get my relic?
- When you're ready.

641
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,123
I think I'm ready.

642
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,963
You're ready when the relic
decides you're ready.

643
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:55,874
For now...

644
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:57,875
conjure a weapon.

645
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:00,628
All right.

646
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:08,143
Fight!

647
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,771
Fight like your life depended on it.

648
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,354
Because one day...

649
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:19,863
it may.

650
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,218
Wong?

651
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:44,899
Okay.

652
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:49,116
"First, open the Eye of Agamotto."

653
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:10,515
All right.

654
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,165
Oh, my.

655
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,805
What if...

656
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,072
"Dormammu."

657
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:16,995
"The Dark Dimension."

658
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,418
Eternal life?

659
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,717
- What the...
- Stop!

660
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:33,177
Tampering with continuum probabilities
is forbidden.

661
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,802
I was just doing
exactly what it said in the book.

662
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,203
What did the book say

663
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:38,807
about the dangers
of performing that ritual?

664
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,476
I don't know.
I hadn't gotten to that part yet.

665
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:43,560
Temporal manipulations
can create branches in time.

666
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:45,979
Unstable dimensional openings.

667
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:48,364
Spatial paradoxes! Time loops!

668
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,490
You wanna get stuck
reliving the same moment

669
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:51,842
over and over forever...

670
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,285
or never having existed at all?

671
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,931
Really should put the warnings
before the spell.

672
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,999
Your curiosity could have
gotten you killed.

673
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,393
You weren't manipulating
the space-time continu

674
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,494
you were breaking it.

675
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,856
We do not tamper with natural law.

676
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:06,957
We defend it.

677
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,504
How did you even do that?

678
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:13,048
Where did you learn the litany of spells
required to even understand it?

679
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:14,301
I've got a photographic memory.

680
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,387
That's how I got my M.D.
and Ph.D. at the same time.

681
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:17,889
What you just did...

682
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,309
takes more than a good memory.

683
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,289
You were born for the mystic arts.

684
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,562
And yet my hands still shake.

685
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:25,934
For now, yes.

686
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,232
Not forever?

687
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:28,525
We're not prophets.

688
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:30,609
When are you gonna start
telling me what we are?

689
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,471
While heroes like the Avengers

690
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,848
protect the world
from physical dangers...

691
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:43,418
we sorcerers safeguard it
against more mystical threats.

692
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,964
The Ancient One
is the latest in a long line

693
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,207
of Sorcerers Supreme...

694
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:52,094
going back thousands of years
to the father of the mystic arts...

695
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,378
the mighty Agamotto.

696
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:58,517
Same sorcerer who created the eye
you so recklessly borrowed.

697
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,497
Agamotto built three Sanctums
in places of power...

698
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,666
where great cities now stand.

699
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:07,939
That door leads to
the Hong Kong Sanctum.

700
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:10,563
That door to the New York Sanctum.

701
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,511
That one to the London Sanctum.

702
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,657
Together...

703
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:18,367
the Sanctums generate
a protective shield around our world.

704
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:20,514
The Sanctums
protect the world...

705
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,957
and we sorcerers...

706
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,868
protect the Sanctums.

707
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,995
From what?

708
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,789
Other dimensional beings
that threaten our universe.

709
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:30,624
Like Dormammu.

710
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,506
Where did you learn that name?

711
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:37,385
I just read it in
<i>The Book of Cagliostro.</i> Why?

712
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,143
Dormammu dwells
in the Dark Dimension.

713
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,307
Beyond time.

714
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,127
He is the cosmic conqueror...

715
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,150
the destroyer of worlds.

716
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,966
A being of infinite power
and endless hunger...

717
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,469
on a quest to invade every universe...

718
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:01,288
and bring all worlds
into his Dark Dimension.

719
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:05,167
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

720
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,503
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

721
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,065
A ritual to contact Dormammu

722
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,685
and draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

723
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,719
Okay...

724
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,304
I'm out.

725
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,679
I came here to heal my hands.

726
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,729
Not to fight in some mystical war.

727
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,026
London.

728
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:37,858
Kaecilius!

729
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,151
No!

730
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,250
Wong? Mordo?

731
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,257
Hello?

732
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:09,616
Hello?

733
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:51,952
Daniel, I see they made you
master of this Sanctum.

734
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:55,163
You know what that means?

735
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,335
That you'll die protecting it.

736
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:14,564
Stop!

737
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:28,245
How long have you been
at Kamar-Taj, Mister...

738
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:29,654
Doctor.

739
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,115
Mister Doctor?

740
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:34,205
It's Strange.

741
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,205
Maybe. Who am I to judge?

742
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,318
You don't know how to use that, do you?

743
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:51,925
What?

744
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,306
Oh, stop it.

745
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,424
I said stop it.

746
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:01,073
You cannot stop this, Mister Doctor.

747
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,603
I don't even know what "this" is.

748
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:04,809
It's the end...

749
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,811
and the beginning.

750
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,726
The many becoming the few
becoming the One.

751
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,899
If you're not gonna start making sense...

752
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,734
I'm just gonna to have to
put this thing back on.

753
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:15,861
Tell me, Mister Doctor...

754
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:19,323
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange.

755
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:21,158
- You are a doctor?
- Yeah.

756
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:22,322
A scientist.

757
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,491
You understand the laws of nature.

758
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:27,936
All things age. All things die.

759
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:29,563
In the end, our sun burns out.

760
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,916
Our universe grows cold and perishes.

761
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,792
But the Dark Dimension...

762
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,633
it's a place beyond time.

763
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,383
That's it. I'm putting this thing back on.

764
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:40,023
This world doesn't have to die, doctor.

765
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,731
This world can take its rightful place
alongside so many others...

766
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,136
as part of the One.

767
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,687
The great and beautiful One.

768
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,190
We can all live forever.

769
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:50,688
Really?

770
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:55,943
What do you have to gain
out of this New Age dimensional utopia?

771
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,103
The same as you.

772
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:01,028
The same as everyone. Life. Eternal life.

773
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,534
People think in terms of good and evil...

774
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,535
when really time
is the true enemy of us all.

775
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,333
Time kills everything.

776
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,168
What about the people you killed?

777
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,520
Tiny.

778
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,089
Momentary specks within
an indifferent universe.

779
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,085
Yes. You see.

780
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:19,921
You see what we're doing.

781
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,282
The world is not what it ought to be.

782
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:24,868
Humanity longs for the eternal...

783
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:27,662
for a world beyond time,
because time is what enslaves us.

784
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,998
Time is an insult.

785
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:31,725
Death is an insult.

786
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,395
Doctor...

787
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:37,839
we don't seek to rule this world.

788
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,174
We seek to save it...

789
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:42,778
to hand it over to Dormammu,
who is the intent of all evolution...

790
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,621
the why of all existence.

791
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:49,538
The Sorcerer Supreme
defends existence.

792
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,333
What was it that brought you
to Kamar-Taj, doctor?

793
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,832
Was it enlightenment?

794
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:56,840
Power?

795
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,091
You came to be healed, as did we all.

796
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:05,408
Kamar-Taj is a place
that collects broken things.

797
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,494
We all come with the promise
of being healed...

798
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:10,438
and instead The Ancient One
gives us parlor tricks.

799
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,251
The real magic she keeps for herself.

800
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:17,696
You ever wonder
how she managed to live this long?

801
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,286
I saw the rituals
in <i>The Book of Cagliostro.</i>

802
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:27,785
So, you know.

803
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,683
The ritual gives me the power

804
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,101
to overthrow The Ancient One...

805
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:32,936
and tear her Sanctums down.

806
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:35,689
To let the Dark Dimension in.

807
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,791
Because what The Ancient One hoards,

808
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:39,505
Dormammu gives freely.

809
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:41,837
Life everlasting.

810
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:44,948
He's not the destroyer of worlds, doctor.

811
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:46,971
He's the savior of worlds.

812
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,244
No. I mean, come on.

813
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:51,187
Look at your face.

814
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,707
Dormammu made you a murderer.

815
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:56,026
Just how good can his kingdom be?

816
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,524
You think that's funny?

817
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:01,652
No, not that.

818
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:04,238
What's funny is that
you've lost your sling ring.

819
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:13,661
Sir, can I help you?

820
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:14,978
Doctor Palmer, where is she?

821
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:16,643
- Sir. We need to get...
- Where is she?

822
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:18,208
The nurse's station.

823
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:19,400
Christine!

824
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:22,545
Stephen?

825
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:23,713
Oh, my God.

826
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:26,383
Get me in an operating theater now.
Just you.

827
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:27,609
Now! I haven't any time.

828
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,302
What happened?

829
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:32,372
I was stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.

830
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:34,908
What are you wearing?

831
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:42,524
Chest cavity is clear.

832
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:45,377
No, the blood is in the pericardial sac.

833
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,489
No, no, no.

834
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:50,590
Stephen?

835
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:53,392
Come on, come on.

836
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,337
Just a little higher.

837
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,940
Please be careful with the needle.

838
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:26,876
Stephen?

839
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:30,630
What am I seeing?

840
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,678
My astral body.

841
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:34,968
Are you dead?

842
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,853
No, Christine. But I am dying.

843
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,932
Right.

844
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:43,393
Yeah. All right.

845
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:45,144
Okay.

846
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,408
Oh, wow.

847
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,872
I've never seen a wound like this.

848
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:58,829
What were you stabbed with?

849
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:00,584
I don't know.

850
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,103
I'm gonna have to vanish now.

851
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:23,541
What?

852
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,188
Keep me alive, will you?

853
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:27,779
Huh?

854
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:30,319
Okay.

855
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:55,848
Oh, shit.

856
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,674
Come on, come on.

857
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:40,848
Stephen, come on.

858
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:44,956
Hit me again.

859
01:09:45,056 --> 01:09:46,649
Stop doing that!

860
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,585
Up the voltage and hit me again.

861
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:49,732
No, your heart's beating!

862
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:51,146
Just do it!

863
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,648
Oh, my God.

864
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,721
Oh, God! Oh, God!

865
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:25,955
Are you okay?

866
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,123
Yeah.

867
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,343
Okay.

868
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:36,820
After all this time...

869
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:38,781
you just show up here...

870
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,413
flying out of your body.

871
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,290
Yeah, I know.

872
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:45,996
I missed you, too, by the way.

873
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:50,647
I wrote you emails,
but you never responded.

874
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:51,999
Why would I?

875
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,213
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

876
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:58,137
For all of it. You were right.

877
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:01,908
I was a complete asshole.
I treated you so horribly.

878
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:04,431
And you deserved so much more.

879
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:06,054
Stop. You're clearly in shock.

880
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:10,316
What the hell is happening?

881
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:11,772
Where have you been?

882
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:15,838
Well, after Western medicine failed me...

883
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,908
I headed east,
and I ended up in Kathmandu.

884
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:20,134
Kathmandu?

885
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:21,531
Yeah.

886
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,700
Like the Bob Seger song?

887
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,782
1975, <i>Beautiful Loser,</i> side A. Yeah.

888
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:29,662
I went to a place called Kamar-Taj...

889
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:33,502
and I talked to someone
called "The Ancient One."

890
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:35,608
So you joined a cult.

891
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,302
No, I didn't. No, not exactly. No.

892
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:41,222
They did teach me to tap into powers
that I never even knew existed.

893
01:11:41,339 --> 01:11:42,636
Yeah. That sounds like a cult.

894
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:44,054
It's not a cult.

895
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,722
Well, that's what a cultist would say.

896
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:46,803
Oh, no.

897
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:49,855
Wait. Stephen, wait.
What do you think you're doing?

898
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:51,724
I'm late for a cult meeting.

899
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,587
This is insane.

900
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:57,755
Yeah.

901
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:59,857
Where are you going?

902
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:01,821
Can you tell me the truth?

903
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,470
Well, a powerful sorcerer

904
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,284
who gave himself over
to an ancient entity...

905
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:08,975
can bend the very laws of physics,
tried very hard to kill me.

906
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,872
But I left him chained up
in Greenwich Village...

907
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:13,458
and the quickest way back there
is through a dimensional gateway...

908
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:14,625
that I opened up in the mop closet.

909
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:16,582
Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

910
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:28,727
Really do have to go.

911
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:30,896
Yeah.

912
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:17,768
Strange!

913
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:21,523
You're okay.

914
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:23,866
A relative term. But yeah, I'm okay.

915
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,402
The Cloak of Levitation.

916
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:28,913
It came to you.

917
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:31,119
No minor feat.

918
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,496
It's a fickle thing.

919
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:35,669
- He's escaped.
- Kaecilius?

920
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:36,954
Yeah.

921
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,757
He can fold space and matter at will.

922
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:43,378
He folds matter
outside the Mirror Dimension...

923
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:44,636
in the real world?

924
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:45,838
Yeah.

925
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:47,803
- How many more?
- Two.

926
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,868
I stranded one in the desert.

927
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,036
And the other?

928
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:53,579
His body's in the hall.

929
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,477
Master Drumm is in the foyer.

930
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:57,333
He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

931
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,001
The London Sanctum has fallen.

932
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,354
Only New York and Hong Kong
remain now...

933
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,606
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

934
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:07,242
You defended the New York Sanctum
from attack.

935
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:09,237
With its master gone, it needs another.

936
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:10,909
Master Strange.

937
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:14,784
No.

938
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:17,979
It is Doctor Strange.

939
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:20,773
Not Master Strange. Not Mister Strange.

940
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,045
Doctor Strange.

941
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:26,904
When I became a doctor,
I swore an oath to do no harm.

942
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:28,322
And I have just killed a man!

943
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:30,241
I'm not doing that again.

944
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:32,810
I became a doctor
to save lives, not take them.

945
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:36,205
You became a doctor
to save one life above all others.

946
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:37,306
Your own.

947
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:40,564
Still seeing through me, are you?

948
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:44,398
I see what I've always seen:
your over-inflated ego.

949
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:48,113
You want to go back to the delusion
that you can control anything...

950
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:49,618
even death...

951
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:51,412
which no one can control.

952
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:54,244
Not even the great
Doctor Stephen Strange.

953
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,584
Not even Dormammu?

954
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:00,087
He offers immortality.

955
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:02,248
It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.

956
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:03,608
He feeds off it.

957
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:06,027
Like you feed off him?

958
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:07,945
You talk to me about controlling death?

959
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:09,113
Oh, I know how you do it.

960
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:12,012
I've seen the missing rituals
from <i>The Book of Cagliostro.</i>

961
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:15,929
Measure your next words
very carefully, doctor.

962
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,896
Because you might not like them?

963
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:21,021
Because you may not know
of what you speak.

964
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:22,769
What is he talking about?

965
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:26,235
I'm talking about her long life,
the source of her immortality.

966
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:29,658
She draws power
from the Dark Dimension

967
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,277
to stay alive.

968
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,363
That's not true.

969
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,741
I've seen the rituals. Worked them out.

970
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:39,035
I know how you do it.

971
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:42,167
Once they regroup...

972
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:43,915
the Zealots will be back.

973
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:46,466
You'll need reinforcements.

974
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:55,430
She's not who you think she is.

975
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:57,477
You don't have the right to say that.

976
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,289
You've no idea the responsibility
that rests upon her shoulders.

977
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:02,312
No, and I don't want to know.

978
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:03,772
You're a coward.

979
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:05,190
Because I'm not a killer?

980
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:06,941
These Zealots will snuff us all out...

981
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:09,615
and you can't muster the strength
to snuff them first?

982
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,217
What do you think I just did?

983
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:12,534
You saved your own life!

984
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:16,452
And then whined about it
like a wounded dog.

985
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:18,077
Oh, you would have done it so easily?

986
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:20,831
You've no idea the things I've done.

987
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:24,855
And the answer is yes.

988
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,673
Without hesitation.

989
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,036
Even if there's another way?

990
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:30,007
There is no other way.

991
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:31,445
You lack imagination.

992
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:32,637
No, Stephen.

993
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:36,347
You lack a spine.

994
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:42,689
They're back.

995
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:50,781
We have to end this.

996
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:52,073
Now!

997
01:16:57,363 --> 01:16:58,410
Strange!

998
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:00,249
Get down here and fight!

999
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:01,666
No!

1000
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,377
The Mirror Dimension.

1001
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:10,376
You can't affect the real world in here.

1002
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:12,173
Who's laughing now?

1003
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:13,504
Asshole.

1004
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:16,428
I am.

1005
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:31,689
I've got his sling ring.

1006
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:32,773
They can't escape, right?

1007
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,283
Run!

1008
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,070
Their connection
to the Dark Dimension

1009
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,090
makes them more powerful
in the Mirror Dimension.

1010
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:58,511
They can't affect the real world,
but they can still kill us.

1011
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:01,435
This wasn't cleverness. It was suicide!

1012
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:20,246
That is hilarious.

1013
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:08,206
This was a mistake.

1014
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:41,795
It's true.

1015
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:46,092
She does draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

1016
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:50,642
Kaecilius.

1017
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:56,276
I came to you broken...

1018
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:59,276
lost, in need.

1019
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:02,274
Trusted you to be my teacher,
and you fed me lies.

1020
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:04,243
I tried to protect you.

1021
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:06,738
- From the truth?
- From yourself.

1022
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:09,115
I have a new teacher now.

1023
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:10,620
Dormammu deceives you.

1024
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,915
You have no idea what he truly is.

1025
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:17,965
His eternal life is not paradise,
but torment.

1026
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:19,340
Liar.

1027
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:16,189
Christine!

1028
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:18,604
Are you kidding me?

1029
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:20,769
Oh, my God.

1030
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:25,507
It's not fibrillation.
She has a stunned myocardium.

1031
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:26,807
- Neurogenic?
- Yes.

1032
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:33,039
Someone get the swabs.

1033
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:36,535
Nic?

1034
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:41,632
We need to relieve
the pressure on her brain.

1035
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,362
She's still dropping.

1036
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:47,488
We're losing her!

1037
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:48,840
We need to increase her oxygen!

1038
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:49,990
I need a crash cart!

1039
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:51,410
Her pupils have dilated!

1040
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:52,868
No reflexes.

1041
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:54,448
We're not reading any brain activity.

1042
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:07,532
What are you doing?

1043
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:10,236
Come on, you're dying!

1044
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:21,418
You have to return to your body now.
You don't have time.

1045
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:23,190
Time is relative.

1046
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:25,588
Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.

1047
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:29,279
I've spent so many years...

1048
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:31,097
peering through time...

1049
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:33,742
looking at this exact moment.

1050
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:35,469
But I can't see past it.

1051
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:39,665
I've prevented countless,
terrible futures.

1052
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:42,334
And after each one,
there's always another.

1053
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:44,795
And they all lead here...

1054
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:45,896
but never further.

1055
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:48,114
You think this is where you die.

1056
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:51,385
You wonder what I see in your future?

1057
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:52,611
No.

1058
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:55,973
Yes.

1059
01:23:56,073 --> 01:23:57,620
I never saw your future.

1060
01:23:57,908 --> 01:24:00,227
Only its possibilities.

1061
01:24:00,327 --> 01:24:03,046
You have such a capacity for goodness.

1062
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:05,107
You always excelled...

1063
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:07,693
but not because you craved success...

1064
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:10,237
but because of your fear of failure.

1065
01:24:10,337 --> 01:24:12,089
That's what made me a great doctor.

1066
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:14,891
It's precisely what kept you
from greatness.

1067
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:18,036
Arrogance and fear still keep you...

1068
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:19,496
from learning the simplest

1069
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:21,623
and most significant lesson of all.

1070
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:22,724
Which is?

1071
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:27,196
It's not about you.

1072
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:32,259
When you first came to me...

1073
01:24:32,359 --> 01:24:35,533
you asked me how I was able
to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

1074
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:37,827
I didn't.

1075
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:43,996
He channels dimensional energy
directly into his own body.

1076
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:45,898
He uses magic to walk?

1077
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:47,170
Constantly.

1078
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:49,592
He had a choice...

1079
01:24:50,377 --> 01:24:52,345
to return to his own life...

1080
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:55,199
or to serve something
greater than himself.

1081
01:24:55,299 --> 01:24:57,951
So I could have my hands back again?

1082
01:24:58,051 --> 01:24:59,473
My old life?

1083
01:25:00,137 --> 01:25:01,389
You could.

1084
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:05,271
And the world would be
all the lesser for it.

1085
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:10,130
I've hated drawing power
from the Dark Dimension.

1086
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:11,381
But as you well know...

1087
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:13,842
sometimes one must break the rules...

1088
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:15,740
in order to serve the greater good.

1089
01:25:15,986 --> 01:25:17,888
Mordo won't see it that way.

1090
01:25:17,988 --> 01:25:20,599
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable...

1091
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,918
forged by the fires of his youth.

1092
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,895
He needs your flexibility...

1093
01:25:24,995 --> 01:25:27,043
just as you need his strength.

1094
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:31,840
Only together do you stand a chance
of stopping Dormammu.

1095
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:33,553
I'm not ready.

1096
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:37,053
No one ever is.

1097
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:40,890
We don't get to choose our time.

1098
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:47,234
Death is what gives life meaning.

1099
01:25:48,352 --> 01:25:50,921
To know your days are numbered.

1100
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:53,069
Your time is short.

1101
01:25:55,025 --> 01:25:57,323
You'd think after
all this time, I'd be ready.

1102
01:25:58,278 --> 01:25:59,972
But look at me.

1103
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:03,076
Stretching one moment out
into a thousand...

1104
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:05,669
just so that I can watch the snow.

1105
01:26:44,408 --> 01:26:45,830
Are you okay?

1106
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:55,753
I don't understand what's happening.

1107
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:57,011
I know.

1108
01:26:57,796 --> 01:27:00,675
But I have to go away now.

1109
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:08,457
You said that losing my hands
didn't have to be the end.

1110
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:10,230
That it could be a beginning.

1111
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:11,481
Yeah.

1112
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:15,697
Because there are other ways
to save lives.

1113
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:20,319
A harder way.

1114
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,806
A weirder way.

1115
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:26,808
<i>Doctor Palmer to the ER, please.</i>

1116
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:28,535
<i>Doctor Palmer to the ER.</i>

1117
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:34,674
I don't want you to go.

1118
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:23,928
Stop!

1119
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:55,831
Choose your weapon wisely.

1120
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,340
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

1121
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:04,635
No one.

1122
01:29:20,564 --> 01:29:21,781
Kaecilius.

1123
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:24,447
You're on the wrong side
of history, Wong.

1124
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:38,648
She's dead.

1125
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:39,965
You were right.

1126
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,211
She wasn't who I thought she was.

1127
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:46,131
She was complicated.

1128
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,141
Complicated?

1129
01:29:55,432 --> 01:29:57,776
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

1130
01:29:57,976 --> 01:29:59,148
Dangerous.

1131
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:01,188
What if it overtook her?

1132
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:05,450
She taught us it was forbidden...

1133
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:10,222
while she drew on its power
to steal centuries of life.

1134
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:12,140
She did what she thought was right.

1135
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,958
The bill comes due.

1136
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:16,290
Don't you see?

1137
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:21,233
Her transgressions
led the Zealots to Dormammu.

1138
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:24,803
Kaecilius was her fault!

1139
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:26,696
And here we are...

1140
01:30:26,796 --> 01:30:29,049
in the consequence of her deception.

1141
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:33,766
A world on fire.

1142
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:36,289
Mordo, the London Sanctum has fallen.

1143
01:30:36,389 --> 01:30:38,250
The New York one
has been attacked twice.

1144
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:39,943
You know where they're going next.

1145
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:41,485
Hong Kong.

1146
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:43,859
You told me once to fight
like my life depended on it...

1147
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:44,979
because one day, it might.

1148
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:46,695
Well, today is that day.

1149
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:49,907
I cannot defeat them alone.

1150
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:08,717
The Sanctum's already fallen.

1151
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:18,519
The Dark Dimension.

1152
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:21,772
Dormammu is coming.

1153
01:31:24,354 --> 01:31:25,401
It's too late.

1154
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:27,194
Nothing can stop him.

1155
01:31:29,526 --> 01:31:30,823
Not necessarily.

1156
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:36,241
No.

1157
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:18,912
The spell's working.

1158
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:22,663
We've got a second chance.

1159
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:03,270
No!

1160
01:34:13,398 --> 01:34:14,900
Wong.

1161
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:24,956
Breaking the laws of nature. I know.

1162
01:34:27,203 --> 01:34:28,625
Well, don't stop now.

1163
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:31,649
When the Sanctum's restored,

1164
01:34:31,749 --> 01:34:32,901
they'll attack it again.

1165
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:34,173
We've got to defend it.

1166
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:35,671
Come on!

1167
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:04,949
Get up, Strange.

1168
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:06,458
Get up and fight.

1169
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:08,328
We can finish this.

1170
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:11,630
You can't fight the inevitable.

1171
01:35:14,918 --> 01:35:16,795
Isn't it beautiful?

1172
01:35:18,296 --> 01:35:20,719
A world beyond time.

1173
01:35:23,218 --> 01:35:24,640
Beyond death.

1174
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:31,309
- Beyond time...
- Strange.

1175
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:05,511
He's gone.

1176
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:10,186
Even Strange has left you
and surrendered to his power.

1177
01:36:42,046 --> 01:36:45,391
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1178
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:47,886
You've come to die.

1179
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:52,315
Your world is now my world...

1180
01:36:52,598 --> 01:36:55,067
like all worlds.

1181
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:28,347
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1182
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:31,329
You've come to die.

1183
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:34,433
Your world is now my...

1184
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,102
What is this?

1185
01:37:37,769 --> 01:37:39,112
Illusion?

1186
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:40,613
No. This is real.

1187
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,198
Good.

1188
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:55,499
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1189
01:37:55,745 --> 01:37:58,999
You've... What is happening?

1190
01:37:59,582 --> 01:38:02,360
Just as you gave Kaecilius
powers from your dimension...

1191
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:04,963
I brought a little power from mine.

1192
01:38:05,338 --> 01:38:07,466
This is time.

1193
01:38:07,965 --> 01:38:11,094
Endless looped time.

1194
01:38:11,636 --> 01:38:13,559
You dare!

1195
01:38:17,308 --> 01:38:19,652
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1196
01:38:20,436 --> 01:38:22,939
You cannot do this forever.

1197
01:38:23,106 --> 01:38:24,653
Actually, I can.

1198
01:38:24,982 --> 01:38:27,260
This is how things are now.

1199
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,471
You and me, trapped in this moment...

1200
01:38:30,571 --> 01:38:31,663
endlessly.

1201
01:38:31,948 --> 01:38:35,498
Then you will spend eternity dying.

1202
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:39,798
Yes. But everyone on Earth will live.

1203
01:38:39,956 --> 01:38:41,549
But you will suffer.

1204
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:43,672
Pain's an old friend.

1205
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:47,672
Dormammu...

1206
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:49,014
I've come to bargain.

1207
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:50,174
End this!

1208
01:38:50,675 --> 01:38:53,053
Dormammu... Dormammu...
Dormammu...

1209
01:39:09,277 --> 01:39:12,281
You will never win.

1210
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:14,699
No...

1211
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:16,876
but I can lose...

1212
01:39:17,827 --> 01:39:20,330
again and again...

1213
01:39:21,038 --> 01:39:22,085
and again...

1214
01:39:22,874 --> 01:39:24,876
and again, forever.

1215
01:39:26,377 --> 01:39:27,879
And that makes you my prisoner.

1216
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:29,280
No!

1217
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:30,620
Stop!

1218
01:39:31,174 --> 01:39:33,597
Make this stop!

1219
01:39:33,885 --> 01:39:35,887
Set me free!

1220
01:39:36,888 --> 01:39:37,889
No.

1221
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:40,357
I've come to bargain.

1222
01:39:42,018 --> 01:39:44,396
What do you want?

1223
01:39:46,189 --> 01:39:48,237
Take your Zealots from the Earth.

1224
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,902
End your assault on my world.

1225
01:39:51,527 --> 01:39:52,949
Never come back.

1226
01:39:53,404 --> 01:39:54,530
Do it...

1227
01:39:55,114 --> 01:39:57,287
and I'll break the loop.

1228
01:40:06,876 --> 01:40:07,923
Get up, Strange!

1229
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:09,337
Get up and fight.

1230
01:40:09,962 --> 01:40:11,555
We can finish this.

1231
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:13,289
Isn't it beautiful?

1232
01:40:15,593 --> 01:40:17,937
A world beyond time.

1233
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:22,103
Beyond death.

1234
01:40:33,945 --> 01:40:35,288
What have you done?

1235
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:36,993
I made a bargain.

1236
01:40:39,951 --> 01:40:40,952
What is this?

1237
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:44,880
Well, it's everything you've ever wanted.

1238
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:48,130
Eternal life as part of the One.

1239
01:40:50,753 --> 01:40:52,505
You're not gonna like it.

1240
01:41:12,483 --> 01:41:13,738
Yeah, you know, you really should have

1241
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:16,721
stolen the whole book
because the warnings...

1242
01:41:16,821 --> 01:41:19,074
The warnings come after the spells.

1243
01:41:28,749 --> 01:41:30,171
Oh, that's funny.

1244
01:41:57,778 --> 01:41:59,030
We did it.

1245
01:42:01,866 --> 01:42:03,038
Yes.

1246
01:42:03,826 --> 01:42:05,544
Yes, we did it.

1247
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:07,959
By also violating...

1248
01:42:08,205 --> 01:42:09,707
the natural law.

1249
01:42:10,541 --> 01:42:13,215
Look around you. It's over.

1250
01:42:13,461 --> 01:42:16,180
You still think there will be
no consequences, Strange?

1251
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:19,305
No price to pay?

1252
01:42:19,884 --> 01:42:22,888
We broke our rules, just like her.

1253
01:42:23,888 --> 01:42:27,358
The bill comes due.

1254
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:29,151
Always!

1255
01:42:30,394 --> 01:42:31,566
A reckoning.

1256
01:42:34,649 --> 01:42:37,493
I will follow this path no longer.

1257
01:43:11,394 --> 01:43:12,862
Yeah, okay.

1258
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:23,535
Wise choice.

1259
01:43:24,281 --> 01:43:26,350
You'll wear the Eye of Agamotto...

1260
01:43:26,450 --> 01:43:28,686
once you've mastered its powers.

1261
01:43:28,786 --> 01:43:29,958
Until then...

1262
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:33,691
best not to walk the streets
wearing an Infinity Stone.

1263
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:34,838
A what?

1264
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:38,279
You might have a gift for the mystic arts,

1265
01:43:38,379 --> 01:43:40,222
but you still have much to learn.

1266
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:45,328
Word of the Ancient One's death
will spread through the Multiverse.

1267
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:47,977
Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme
to defend it.

1268
01:43:48,472 --> 01:43:49,473
We must be ready.

1269
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:50,641
We'll be ready.

1270
01:46:37,141 --> 01:46:40,486
<i>So Earth has wizards now, huh?</i>

1271
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:43,480
Tea?

1272
01:46:44,106 --> 01:46:45,466
I don't drink tea.

1273
01:46:45,566 --> 01:46:46,567
What do you drink?

1274
01:46:47,943 --> 01:46:49,286
Not tea.

1275
01:46:52,781 --> 01:46:54,328
So, I keep a watch list...

1276
01:46:54,575 --> 01:46:56,327
of individuals and beings
from other realms

1277
01:46:56,452 --> 01:46:57,852
that may be a threat to this world.

1278
01:46:57,995 --> 01:47:01,590
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

1279
01:47:04,001 --> 01:47:05,653
Worthy inclusion.

1280
01:47:05,753 --> 01:47:06,925
Yeah.

1281
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:12,101
So why bring him here to New York?

1282
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:13,744
It's a bit of a long story.

1283
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:15,830
Family drama, that kind of thing.

1284
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:17,682
But we're looking for my father.

1285
01:47:18,182 --> 01:47:21,377
Oh, okay. So if you found Odin...

1286
01:47:21,477 --> 01:47:24,526
you'd all return to Asgard promptly?

1287
01:47:24,688 --> 01:47:25,985
Oh, yes. Promptly.

1288
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:27,567
Great!

1289
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:30,486
Allow me to help you.

1290
01:53:31,722 --> 01:53:32,848
Can I help you?

1291
01:53:34,099 --> 01:53:37,228
They carried you into Kamar-Taj
on a stretcher.

1292
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,739
Look at you now, Pangborn.

1293
01:53:42,107 --> 01:53:43,108
Mordo.

1294
01:53:45,944 --> 01:53:47,763
So what can I do for you, man?

1295
01:53:47,863 --> 01:53:49,681
I've been away
for many months now,

1296
01:53:49,781 --> 01:53:51,533
and I've had a revelation.

1297
01:53:52,409 --> 01:53:54,958
The true purpose of a sorcerer...

1298
01:53:55,245 --> 01:53:57,873
is to twist things out of
their proper shape...

1299
01:53:58,790 --> 01:54:00,292
stealing power...

1300
01:54:01,126 --> 01:54:02,628
perverting nature.

1301
01:54:03,295 --> 01:54:04,638
Like you.

1302
01:54:05,589 --> 01:54:07,933
I've stolen nothing. This is my power.

1303
01:54:08,759 --> 01:54:10,807
- Mine.
- Power...

1304
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:13,597
has a purpose.

1305
01:54:27,652 --> 01:54:29,780
Why are you doing this?

1306
01:54:29,988 --> 01:54:33,162
Because I see, at long last,
what's wrong with the world.

1307
01:54:38,455 --> 01:54:40,583
Too many sorcerers.
