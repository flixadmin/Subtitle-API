2
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:29,206
The Tesseract has awakened.

3
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:35,535
It is on a little world,  a human world.

4
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,538
They wield its power,

5
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:46,413
but our ally knows it's working,
so that they never will learn.

6
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:56,600
He's ready to lead, and our force,
our Chitauri will follow.

7
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:02,957
The world will be his and
the universe yours.

8
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:09,695
And the humans, what can they do,
but burn.

9
00:01:59,306 --> 00:02:00,321
How bad is it?

10
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:04,226
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

11
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:10,848
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge 
from the Tesseract four hour ago.

12
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:12,993
NASA didn't authorize Selvig 
to pull the test phase.

13
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:16,675
He wasn't testing it, he wasn't 
even in the room. Spontaneous advancement

14
00:02:16,675 --> 00:02:17,650
It just turned itself on?

15
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,871
What are the engine levels now?

16
00:02:19,146 --> 00:02:21,500
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut
it down, we ordered the evac.

17
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,614
How long to get everyone out?

18
00:02:22,614 --> 00:02:24,095
Campus should be clear in the next
half hour.

19
00:02:24,364 --> 00:02:25,517
Do better.

20
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,850
Sir, evacuation maybe futile.

21
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,409
We should tell them
to go back to sleep?

22
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:35,093
If we can't control the Tesseract's energy,
there may not be a minimum safe distance.

23
00:02:35,093 --> 00:02:38,242
I need you to make sure that phase
2 prototypes are shipped out.

24
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,575
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

25
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:44,572
Until such time as the world ends,
we will act as though it intends to spin on.

26
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:48,907
Clear out the tech below. 
Every piece of phase 2 on a truck and gone.

27
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:52,177
Yes, sir. Come with me.

28
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:57,116
Talk to me,  Doctor.

29
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,286
- Director.
- Is there anything we know for certain?

30
00:03:01,487 --> 00:03:04,757
- Tesseract is misbehaving.
- Is that supposed to be funny?

31
00:03:04,957 --> 00:03:10,095
No, it's not funny at all.
The Tesseract is not only active, 
she's...misbehaving.

32
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:13,332
-How soon until you pull the plug?

33
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:16,702
She's an energy source.
If we turn off the power, 
she turns it back on.

34
00:03:16,902 --> 00:03:20,005
-  If she reaches peak level...
- We've prepared for this, doctor.

35
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:23,108
- Harnessing energy from space.
- We don't have the harness.

36
00:03:23,308 --> 00:03:27,513
Our calculations are far from complete.
Now she's throwing off interference, radiation

37
00:03:27,713 --> 00:03:30,449
Nothing harmful, 
low levels of gamma radiation.

38
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:34,520
That can be harmful.
Where's Agent Barton?

39
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,291
The Hawk?  
Up in his nest, as usual.

40
00:03:40,392 --> 00:03:42,428
Agent Barton, report to me.

41
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:45,864
I gave you this detail so you could
keep a close eye on things.

42
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:48,534
- I can see better from a distance.
- Are you seeing anything that might

43
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:52,404
- set this thing off?
- Doctor, it's spiking again.

44
00:03:52,604 --> 00:03:55,808
No one come or gone.
It's oven is clean.

45
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:58,644
No contacts, no I.M.'s.

46
00:03:58,844 --> 00:04:01,714
If there was any tampering, sir,
it wasn't at this end.

47
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:07,986
- At this end?
- A cube of space, one end of the door.

48
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:11,023
Yeah, the cube is a doorway 
to the other end of space, right?

49
00:04:11,024 --> 00:04:11,690
The doors open from both sides.

50
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:25,497
Sir, please put down the spear!

51
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:05,301
You have a heart.

52
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:37,100
Please don't.

53
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:41,504
- I still need that.
- This doesn't have to get any messier.

54
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:45,875
Of course it does. I've come
too far for anything else.

55
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:50,280
I am Loki of Asgard,

56
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:56,252
- and I am burdened with glorious purpose.
- Loki, brother of Thor?

57
00:06:56,452 --> 00:06:58,922
We have no quarrel with your people.

58
00:06:59,122 --> 00:07:02,559
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

59
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,664
- You planning to step on us?
- I come with glad tidings,

60
00:07:08,998 --> 00:07:12,468
- of a world made free.
- Free from what?

61
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:17,073
Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie.

62
00:07:17,273 --> 00:07:21,878
Once you accept that, in your heart...

63
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:27,350
You will know peace.

64
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,921
Yeah, you say peace, I kind of
think you mean the other piece.

65
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:36,426
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.
This place is about to blow

66
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:40,363
Drop a hundred feet of raw material,
he means to bury us.

67
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:42,599
- Like The Pharaohs of Odin.
- He was right.

68
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:44,779
He's right, the portal is
collapsing in on itself.

69
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,836
You got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical.

70
00:07:47,036 --> 00:07:49,072
Drop him.

71
00:08:02,753 --> 00:08:05,089
Need these vehicles.

72
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:10,661
- Who's that?
- He didn't tell me.

73
00:08:13,063 --> 00:08:18,569
Hill, do you copy? Barton is....

74
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:34,852
He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!

75
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:14,024
ets go, no no no.. leave leave, go.

76
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,810
We cleared upstairs, sir.
We need to go.

77
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:07,471
Director? Director Fury , do you copy?

78
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:10,987
The Tesseract is with the hostile force.
I have men down. Hill?

79
00:11:11,186 --> 00:11:14,935
A lot of men still under,
don't know how many survivors.

80
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:18,254
Sound the general call,
I want every living soul not needing rescue

81
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:21,400
- looking for that briefcase.
- Roger that.

82
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:24,658
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a level seven.

83
00:11:25,388 --> 00:11:29,536
As of right now, we are at war.

84
00:11:30,365 --> 00:11:32,356
What do we do?

85
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:42,908
Subtitle By JAVANI

86
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,844
I do not want to end tonight.

87
00:12:11,977 --> 00:12:14,100
I want to know how
for it to end.

88
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,220
Believe me, you must
to be better prepared.

89
00:12:17,551 --> 00:12:21,865
Do you work?
Lermentoville?

90
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:27,074
Is he confident that we will do -

91
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:29,928
transport without him?

92
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:34,939
I thought that a General
Tchalakov handle exports.

93
00:12:35,072 --> 00:12:39,784
Tchalakov. Running Boy, doll.

94
00:12:41,675 --> 00:12:46,454
Outdated information
derived from the fall.

95
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:51,332
Famous Black Widow

96
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:56,939
it's just a pretty face.

97
00:12:57,072 --> 00:13:00,523
Do I feel beautiful?

98
00:13:02,812 --> 00:13:09,549
We do not need Lermentovia
transport tank.

99
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:14,658
Tell him that we give up
medium term by hand. It's true ...

100
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:20,333
You may have to write it down.

101
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:26,936
Yes?

102
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,653
You ask.

103
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:37,588
- Listen carefully ...
- You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor.

104
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:40,674
We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out.

105
00:13:40,807 --> 00:13:42,850
Put the woman on the
phone, or I will blow

106
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:45,320
up the block before you
can make the lobby.

107
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,914
- We need you to come in.
- Are you kidding? I'm working!

108
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,933
- This takes precedence.
- I'm in the middle of an interrogation and this

109
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:59,323
moron is giving me everything.

110
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:02,906
I don't give everything.

111
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:06,756
- Look, you can't pull me out of this right now.
- Natasha.

112
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:09,908
Barton's been compromised.

113
00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:14,322
Let me put you on hold.

114
00:14:56,298 --> 00:14:58,123
- Where's Barton now?
- We don't know.

115
00:14:58,255 --> 00:15:00,180
- But he's alive.
- We think so.

116
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:02,375
I'll brief you on everything
when you get back.

117
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:04,394
But first, we need you
to talk to the big guy.

118
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:07,779
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts
me about as far as he can throw me.

119
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:12,060
No, I've got Stark.
You get the big guy.

120
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,506
Oh, God.

121
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:36,084
- Do not come here!
- Who are you?

122
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:40,199
Go away. Here is a disease.

123
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:44,347
Are you a doctor?
My father did not wake up!

124
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:47,565
Body heat, and he
make noise, but did not open his eyes.

125
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:49,556
A slower rate.

126
00:15:50,054 --> 00:15:52,244
My father ...

127
00:15:53,406 --> 00:15:55,496
And like that?

128
00:15:58,714 --> 00:16:00,705
Please...

129
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,542
Should have got paid up front,
Banner.

130
00:16:29,674 --> 00:16:32,564
You know, for a man who's
supposed to be avoiding

131
00:16:32,565 --> 00:16:35,338
stress, you picked a hell
of a place to settle.

132
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:42,577
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.
-Then what is it? Yoga?

133
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:47,067
ou brought me to the edge of the city,
smart.

134
00:16:47,537 --> 00:16:51,190
I uh...assume the whole 
place is surrounded?

135
00:16:52,128 --> 00:16:54,239
Just you and me.

136
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:59,300
And your actress buddy, is she a spy too?
Do you start that young?

137
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:01,780
- I did.
- Who are you?

138
00:17:01,913 --> 00:17:04,494
Natasha Romanoff.

139
00:17:06,571 --> 00:17:10,627
Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff?
Because that's not gonna work out for everyone.

140
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:14,146
No. No. Of course not.
I'm here on behalf of SHIELD.

141
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:19,609
SHIELD. How did they find me?

142
00:17:19,742 --> 00:17:22,624
We never lost you, doctor.
We've kept our distance,

143
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:26,412
even helped keep some other 
interested parties off your scent.

144
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,031
- Why?
- Nick Fury seems to trust you.

145
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:32,511
But now I need you to come in.

146
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:37,170
- What if I say no?
- I'll persuade you.

147
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:43,134
And what if the...other guy says no?

148
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:46,464
You've been more than a
year without an incident.

149
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,464
I don't think you wanna
break that streak.

150
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:53,859
I don't get every time what I want.

151
00:17:54,495 --> 00:17:58,283
Doctor, we're facing a
potential global catastrophe.

152
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:02,739
- Well, those I actively try to avoid.
- This is the

153
00:18:03,342 --> 00:18:05,621
Tesseract.

154
00:18:05,756 --> 00:18:09,610
It has the potential
energy to wipe out the planet.

155
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,256
- What does Fury want me to do?
Swallow it?

156
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:17,251
- Well, he wants you to find it.
It's been taken.

157
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:21,607
It omits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.

158
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:24,657
There's no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do.

159
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:28,208
If there was, that's where I'd be.

160
00:18:28,344 --> 00:18:32,063
- So Fury isn't after the monster?
- Not that he's told me.

161
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:34,644
And he tells you everything?

162
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:37,660
- Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.
- He needs me in a cage?

163
00:18:37,794 --> 00:18:41,078
- No one's gonna put you in a...
- Stop lying to me!

164
00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:46,608
I'm sorry, that was mean.

165
00:18:47,613 --> 00:18:50,126
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

166
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:55,556
Why don't we do this the easy way,
where you don't use that,

167
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,248
and the other guy doesn't
make a mess? Okay?

168
00:19:00,381 --> 00:19:04,135
Natasha.

169
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:13,250
Stand down. We're good here.

170
00:19:14,926 --> 00:19:17,339
Just you and me?

171
00:19:18,746 --> 00:19:21,461
This is out of line, Director.

172
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:24,243
You're dealing with forces
you can't control.

173
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:27,896
You ever been in a war,
Councilman? In a firefight?

174
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:30,777
Did you feel an over
abundance of control?

175
00:19:30,912 --> 00:19:34,330
You saying that this Asgard has
declared war on our planet?

176
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,145
Not Asgard. Loki.

177
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,132
He can't be working alone.
What about the other one? His brother.

178
00:19:41,268 --> 00:19:43,446
Our intelligence says,
Thor is not a hostile.

179
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,438
But he's worlds away, we can't depend on
him to help either. It's up to us.

180
00:19:47,441 --> 00:19:49,417
Which is why you should be
focusing on phase 2,

181
00:19:49,431 --> 00:19:54,257
- it was designed for exactly...
- Phase 2 isn't ready, our enemy is.

182
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:58,413
- We need a response team.
- The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

183
00:19:58,677 --> 00:20:01,400
- This isn't about The Avengers.
- We have seen the list.

184
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:03,887
We're running the world's greatest
covert security network

185
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:06,996
and you're gonna leave the fate of
human race to a handful of freaks.

186
00:20:07,197 --> 00:20:11,640
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.
We need a response team.

187
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:14,581
These people may be isolated,
unbalanced even,

188
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:18,991
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.

189
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:24,471
- You believe?
- War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

190
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,715
No, it's won by soldiers.

191
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,107
There's not enough time. I'm gotta
pull into the water.

192
00:20:56,885 --> 00:20:59,993
- You wont be alone.
- .Oh God.

193
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,833
This guy is still alive.

194
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:29,071
Trouble sleeping?

195
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:33,582
I slept for 70 years, Sir.
I think I've had my fill.

196
00:21:34,082 --> 00:21:38,827
Then you should be out,
celebrating, seeing the world.

197
00:21:43,874 --> 00:21:46,714
I went under, the world was at war,

198
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:51,492
I wake up, they say we won.
They didn't say what we lost.

199
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:56,606
We've made some mistakes along the way.
Some very recently.

200
00:21:57,674 --> 00:21:59,879
- You here with a mission, sir?
- I am.

201
00:22:00,081 --> 00:22:04,091
- Trying to get me back in the world?
- Trying to save it.

202
00:22:08,601 --> 00:22:10,606
Hydra's secret weapon.

203
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:14,517
Howard Stark fished that out of the
ocean when he was looking for you.

204
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:18,159
He thought what we think,
the Tesseract could be the key to

205
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:21,067
unlimited sustainable energy.

206
00:22:21,265 --> 00:22:24,675
That's something the world sorely needs.

207
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,421
- Who took it from you?
- He's called Loki.

208
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,328
He's not from around here.

209
00:22:32,695 --> 00:22:36,403
There's a lot we'll have to bring you
up to speed on if you're in.

210
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,580
The world has gotten even stranger
than you already know.

211
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:43,556
At this point,
I doubt anything would surprise me.

212
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:46,596
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

213
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:51,273
There's a debriefing package waiting
for you back at your apartment.

214
00:22:53,546 --> 00:22:56,955
Is there anything you can tell us
about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?

215
00:22:57,155 --> 00:22:59,828
You should have left it in the ocean.

216
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:35,048
You're good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.

217
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,622
You disconnected the transition lines?
Are we off the grid?

218
00:23:37,822 --> 00:23:41,665
Stark Towers is about to become a
beacon of self sustaining clean energy.

219
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:45,141
Wow, so maybe our reactor takes over
and it actually works?

220
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:48,649
I assume. Light her up.

221
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:57,672
- How does it look?
- Like Christmas, but with more...me.

222
00:23:57,872 --> 00:24:01,247
Gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign.
You need to do some press.

223
00:24:01,448 --> 00:24:03,954
I can do some more tomorrow, I'm working
on the zoning for the next billboards.

224
00:24:04,154 --> 00:24:07,697
Pepper, you're killing me. Remember?
Enjoy the moment.

225
00:24:07,897 --> 00:24:10,236
I remember.

226
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:15,749
Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line.

227
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,258
I'm not in. I'm actually out.

228
00:24:26,243 --> 00:24:28,849
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

229
00:24:29,048 --> 00:24:32,258
Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.

230
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:39,274
Levels are holding steady...I think.

231
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:42,984
Of course they are, I was directly involved.
Which brings me to my next question.

232
00:24:43,185 --> 00:24:47,696
- How does it feel to be a genius?
- Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now, would I?

233
00:24:47,844 --> 00:24:51,949
What do you mean? All this, came from you.

234
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:55,923
No. All this, came from that.

235
00:24:56,491 --> 00:24:59,730
Give yourself some credit, please.
Stark Tower -

236
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,638
Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself,
twelve percent of the credit.

237
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:06,008
- Twelve percent?
- An argument can be made for fifteen.

238
00:25:06,206 --> 00:25:10,079
- Twelve percent for my baby?
- Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

239
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,154
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.
And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you.

240
00:25:14,353 --> 00:25:17,559
- My private elevator.
- You mean our elevator?

241
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:20,797
It was teeming with sweaty workmen.

242
00:25:20,997 --> 00:25:25,638
I'm going to pay for that comment about
percentages in some subtle way later on, aren't I?

243
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,711
Not gonna be that subtle.

244
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,148
I'll tell you what. Next building
is gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.

245
00:25:31,348 --> 00:25:35,922
- On the lease.
- Call your mom, can you bunk over?

246
00:25:36,122 --> 00:25:39,762
Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid
my protocol's are being overwritten.

247
00:25:39,963 --> 00:25:42,365
Stark, we need to talk.

248
00:25:42,566 --> 00:25:46,038
You have reached the life model
decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message.

249
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:49,077
- This is urgent.
- Then leave it urgently.

250
00:25:50,545 --> 00:25:52,649
- Security breach. That's on you.
- Mr Stark.

251
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,419
- Phil! Come in.
- Phil.

252
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:58,292
- I can't stay.
- Uh...his first name is Agent.

253
00:25:58,492 --> 00:26:02,165
- Come on in, we're celebrating.
- Which is why he can't stay.Soon as possible.

254
00:26:02,532 --> 00:26:05,837
- I don't like being handed things
- That's alright, cause I love to be handed things.

255
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:09,310
So, let's trade.

256
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,615
Thank you.

257
00:26:13,048 --> 00:26:16,021
Official consulting hours are between
eight and five every other Thursday.

258
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:19,258
- This isn't a consultation.
- Is this about The Avengers?

259
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:23,499
- Which I...I know nothing about.
- The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought.

260
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:26,437
- And I didn't even qualify.
- I didn't know that either.

261
00:26:26,638 --> 00:26:31,278
Yeah, apparently I'm volatile,
self obsessed, don't play well with others.

262
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:34,817
- That I did know.
- This isn't about personality profiles anymore.

263
00:26:35,017 --> 00:26:38,324
- Whatever. Miss Potts, got a sec?

264
00:26:43,131 --> 00:26:47,939
- You know, I thought we were having a moment.
- I was having twelve percent of a moment.

265
00:26:48,505 --> 00:26:50,977
This seems so serious, Phil's pretty shaken.

266
00:26:51,178 --> 00:26:55,050
- How did you notice? Why is he Phil?
- What is all this?

267
00:26:55,251 --> 00:26:57,288
This is uh...

268
00:26:57,454 --> 00:26:59,523
This.

269
00:27:05,901 --> 00:27:08,105
- I'm going to take the jet to D.C. tonight.
- Tomorrow.

270
00:27:08,305 --> 00:27:10,809
You have homework. You have a lot of homework.

271
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,146
Well, what if I didn't?

272
00:27:13,313 --> 00:27:17,288
If you didn't?
You mean if you finished?

273
00:27:18,322 --> 00:27:22,161
Then ...

274
00:27:26,734 --> 00:27:29,139
Square deal. It's the last date.

275
00:27:32,145 --> 00:27:34,414
Work hard.

276
00:27:36,183 --> 00:27:39,056
- Do you drive past the airport, by chance?
- I can drop you.

277
00:27:39,256 --> 00:27:44,029
Oh, fantastic. Does the cellist
You? Is it true relationship?

278
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:46,934
- He moved back to Portland.
- What?

279
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:58,288
We are a forty-minute
from the base, sir.

280
00:28:01,727 --> 00:28:05,300
So this Dr. Banner was trying to
replicate the serum that was used on me?

281
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,474
A lot of people were. You were
the world's first superhero.

282
00:28:09,674 --> 00:28:12,088
Banner thought gammer
radiation might hold the

283
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:14,347
key to unlocking Erskine's
original formula.

284
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:18,192
- Didn't really go his way, did it?
- Not so much.

285
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:22,179
When he's got that thing though,
guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

286
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:26,573
He's like a smart person.

287
00:28:27,993 --> 00:28:32,658
I gotta say, it's an honor
to meet you, officially.

288
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:36,780
I sort of met you, I mean,
I watched you while you were sleeping.

289
00:28:37,997 --> 00:28:43,877
I mean, I was...I was present while
you were unconscious from the ice.

290
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:48,269
You know, it's really, it's just a...
just a huge honor to have you on board.

291
00:28:48,744 --> 00:28:53,373
- Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.
- Oh, you are. Absolutely.

292
00:28:53,678 --> 00:28:58,848
Uh...we've made some modifications
to the uniform. I had a little design input.

293
00:28:58,984 --> 00:29:05,438
The uniform? Aren't the stars and
stripes a little...old fashioned?

294
00:29:06,384 --> 00:29:10,677
Everything that's happening,
the things that are about to come to light,

295
00:29:11,522 --> 00:29:15,036
people might just need
a little old fashioned.

296
00:29:47,883 --> 00:29:52,345
- The Chitauri grow restless.
- Let them grow restless.

297
00:29:52,783 --> 00:29:56,198
- I will lead them in the glorious battle.
- Battle? Against a meagre might of earth?

298
00:29:56,602 --> 00:30:01,368
- Glorious, not lengthy.

299
00:30:01,503 --> 00:30:07,079
If your force is
as formidable as you claim.

300
00:30:07,247 --> 00:30:09,511
You question us?

301
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:14,513
Question him?
He who put the scepter in your hand?

302
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,994
Who gave you ancient
knowledge and new purpose?

303
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:20,338
When you were cast out, defeated!

304
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,950
I was a king!
The rightful king of Asgard. Betrayed.

305
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:32,127
Your ambition is little and
full of childish need.

306
00:30:33,193 --> 00:30:35,695
We look beyond the earth to great worlds

307
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:38,400
The Tesseract will avail.

308
00:30:38,408 --> 00:30:40,807
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

309
00:30:42,565 --> 00:30:44,862
I don't threaten.

310
00:30:45,268 --> 00:30:47,836
But until I open the doors,

311
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:53,317
until your force is mine to command,
you are the wars.

312
00:30:54,568 --> 00:31:00,279
You will have your war as guardian.

313
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:02,911
If you fail, -

314
00:31:03,385 --> 00:31:07,880
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

315
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:11,967
there will be no realm, no barren moon,

316
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:15,957
no crevasse where I can't find you.

317
00:31:17,444 --> 00:31:20,046
You think you know pain?

318
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:26,940
You will receive something sweet as pain.

319
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:57,622
- Get your captain equipment.
- All right.

320
00:31:59,175 --> 00:32:02,318
Agent Romanoff , he's Captain Rogers.

321
00:32:04,246 --> 00:32:09,044
- They need you on the bridge,
They're starting phase trace.
- See you there.

322
00:32:09,225 --> 00:32:13,044
There was quite the buzz around here,
finding you in the ice.

323
00:32:13,653 --> 00:32:15,984
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

324
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:19,296
Did he ask you to sign his Captain America
trading cards yet?

325
00:32:19,668 --> 00:32:23,722
- Trading Cards?
- They're vintage, he's very proud.

326
00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:27,102
Dr. Banner.

327
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:29,974
Oh, yeah. Hi.

328
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,591
- They told me you'd be coming.
- Word is you can find the cube.

329
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:38,187
- Is that the only word on me?
- Only word I care about.

330
00:32:40,078 --> 00:32:42,849
Must be strange for you, all of this.

331
00:32:43,323 --> 00:32:49,002
- Well, this is actually kind of familiar.
- Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute.

332
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:51,299
It's gonna get a little hard to breath.

333
00:32:58,922 --> 00:33:01,054
Is this is a submarine?

334
00:33:01,254 --> 00:33:05,989
Really? They wanted me in a submerged
pressurized metal container?

335
00:33:32,453 --> 00:33:33,417
Oh, no. This is much worse.

336
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:28,760
- All engine operating.SHEILD emergency protocol
1 9 3.6 in effect. We're in level, sir.

337
00:34:28,761 --> 00:34:30,345
- Good.

338
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:35,045
- Lets vanish.
- Engage retro reflection panels.

339
00:34:49,743 --> 00:34:54,977
- Reflection panels engaged.
- Gentlemen.

340
00:35:05,177 --> 00:35:12,408
- Doctor, thank you for coming.
- Thanks for asking nicely.

341
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:14,540
- So, uh...
how long am I staying?

342
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:18,310
- Once we get our hands on the
Tesseract, you're in the clear.

343
00:35:18,478 --> 00:35:20,478
Where are you with that?

344
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,878
We're sweeping every
wirelessly accessible camera on the planet.

345
00:35:24,012 --> 00:35:27,908
Cell phones, laptops. If it's
connected to a satellite,

346
00:35:28,111 --> 00:35:31,009
-  it's eyes and ears for us.
- That's still not gonna find them in time.

347
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,441
You have to narrow the field.
How many spectrometers do you have access to?

348
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:36,643
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know,

349
00:35:36,776 --> 00:35:40,075
tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

350
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:43,309
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm
based on cluster recognition.

351
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:46,074
At least we could rule out a few places.

352
00:35:46,409 --> 00:35:49,342
- Do you have somewhere for me to work?
- Agent Romanoff,

353
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:52,307
would you show Dr. Banner to his
laboratory, please.

354
00:35:52,973 --> 00:35:55,440
You're gonna love it, Doc.
We got all the toys.

355
00:35:55,507 --> 00:35:57,206
- Put over there.

356
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:07,473
- Is this the stuff you need?
- Yeah, Iridium.

357
00:36:07,674 --> 00:36:10,273
It's found in meteorites,
it forms anti-protons.

358
00:36:10,473 --> 00:36:13,872
- It's very hard to get hold of
- Specially if SHIELD knows you need it.

359
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:16,205
Well, I didn't know!

360
00:36:17,206 --> 00:36:22,038
The Tesseract is showing me so much.
It's...it's more than knowledge, it's truth.

361
00:36:22,237 --> 00:36:25,372
I know. What did it show you,
Agent Barton?

362
00:36:26,736 --> 00:36:29,739
- My next target.
- Tell me what you need.

363
00:36:32,702 --> 00:36:34,872
I need a distraction.

364
00:36:35,503 --> 00:36:37,536
And an eyeball.

365
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,270
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

366
00:36:46,503 --> 00:36:48,669
No, no. It's fine.

367
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:54,502
It's a vintage set. It took me
a couple of yearsto collect them all.

368
00:36:57,302 --> 00:37:00,168
Near mint, slight foxing
around the edges, but...

369
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:02,800
We got a hit.
Sixty seven percent match.

370
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:06,202
Weight, cross match,
seventy nine percent.

371
00:37:06,402 --> 00:37:09,866
- Location?
- Stuttgart, Germany.
28, Canning Strasse.

372
00:37:10,568 --> 00:37:13,268
- He's not exactly hiding.
- Captain,

373
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:15,699
you're up.

374
00:39:49,217 --> 00:39:51,751
Kneel before me.

375
00:39:54,917 --> 00:39:58,216
I said.

376
00:39:58,451 --> 00:40:01,116
Kneel!

377
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:13,615
Is not this simpler?

378
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:18,449
Is this not your natural state?

379
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,680
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

380
00:40:23,914 --> 00:40:26,680
that you crave subjugation.

381
00:40:26,881 --> 00:40:29,400
The bright lure of freedom diminishes

382
00:40:29,422 --> 00:40:34,247
your life's joy in a mad
scramble for power,

383
00:40:35,379 --> 00:40:38,112
and identity.

384
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:42,153
You were made to be ruled.

385
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:46,843
In the end, you will always kneel.

386
00:40:53,878 --> 00:40:56,358
Not to men like you.

387
00:40:56,785 --> 00:41:02,665
- There are no men like me.
- There are always men like you.

388
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:06,300
Look to your elder, people.

389
00:41:07,852 --> 00:41:10,627
Let him be an example.

390
00:41:16,078 --> 00:41:21,990
You know, the last time I was in Germany
and saw a man standing above everybody else,

391
00:41:22,255 --> 00:41:23,412
we ended up disagreeing.

392
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:33,508
I'm not the one who's out of time.

393
00:41:34,102 --> 00:41:37,242
Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.

394
00:41:56,996 --> 00:41:58,648
Kneel.

395
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:00,827
Not today!

396
00:42:02,248 --> 00:42:04,793
The guy's all over the place.

397
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:09,615
Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?

398
00:42:26,134 --> 00:42:28,610
Make your move, Reindeer names.

399
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:37,993
Good move.

400
00:42:38,983 --> 00:42:42,187
- Mr Stark.
- Captain.

401
00:42:49,323 --> 00:42:52,528
- Didn't he say anything?
- Not a word.

402
00:42:52,727 --> 00:42:55,269
Just get in here.
We're low on time.

403
00:42:57,912 --> 00:43:00,984
- I don't like it.
- What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

404
00:43:01,182 --> 00:43:04,585
I don't remember it being that easy.
This guy packs a wallop.

405
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:08,251
Still, you were pretty spry,
for an older fellow.

406
00:43:09,275 --> 00:43:11,720
- What's your thing? Pilates?
- What?

407
00:43:11,918 --> 00:43:15,452
It's like calisthenics.
You might have missed a couple things,

408
00:43:15,651 --> 00:43:17,797
you know, doing time as a Capsicle.

409
00:43:19,153 --> 00:43:21,145
- Fury didn't tell me
he was calling you in.

410
00:43:21,146 --> 00:43:23,579
- Yeah, there's a lot of
things Fury doesn't tell you.

411
00:43:24,174 --> 00:43:26,158
Where's this coming from?

412
00:43:29,823 --> 00:43:32,564
What's the matter?
Scared of a little lightning?

413
00:43:32,763 --> 00:43:35,736
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

414
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:10,192
- Now there's that guy.
- Another Asgardian?

415
00:44:10,621 --> 00:44:12,173
- Think the guy's a friendly?
- Doesn't matter.

416
00:44:12,371 --> 00:44:15,214
If he frees Loki or kills him,
the Tesseract's lost.

417
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:20,531
- Stark, we need a plan of attack.
- I have a plan. Attack.

418
00:44:25,751 --> 00:44:28,657
- I'd sit this one out, Cap.
- I don't see how I can.

419
00:44:28,857 --> 00:44:31,828
These guys come from legends,
they're basically Gods.

420
00:44:32,027 --> 00:44:35,792
There's only one God, ma'am.And I'm pretty sure
 he doesn't dress like that.

421
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,259
- Where's the Tesseract?
- I missed you too.

422
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:58,322
- Do I look to be in a gaming mood?
- Oh, you should thank me.

423
00:44:58,685 --> 00:45:01,303
With the Bifrost gone,
how much dark energy did the

424
00:45:01,304 --> 00:45:03,708
All-Father have to muster
to conjure you here?

425
00:45:03,904 --> 00:45:06,053
Your precious earth.

426
00:45:09,222 --> 00:45:11,338
I thought you dead.

427
00:45:12,654 --> 00:45:15,236
Did you mourn?
- We all did.

428
00:45:15,433 --> 00:45:19,068
- Our father...
- Your father.

429
00:45:21,116 --> 00:45:23,594
He did tell you my true parentage,
did he not?

430
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:28,779
We were raised together.

431
00:45:28,945 --> 00:45:31,422
We played together, we fought together.

432
00:45:32,116 --> 00:45:35,124
- Do you remember none of that?
- I remember a shadows.

433
00:45:36,874 --> 00:45:39,846
living in the shade of your greatness.

434
00:45:40,591 --> 00:45:43,365
I remember you tossing me into an abyss.

435
00:45:43,563 --> 00:45:48,400
- I who was and should be king!
- So you take the world I love
as recompense for

436
00:45:48,422 --> 00:45:49,669
your imagined slights?

437
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,169
No, the earth is under
my protection, Loki.

438
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,689
And you're doing a marvelous job
with that.

439
00:45:58,118 --> 00:46:01,915
The humans slaughter each other in droves,
while you ideally threat.

440
00:46:02,114 --> 00:46:07,033
- I mean to rule them. That's why should I not...
- Think yourself above them.

441
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:11,455
- Well, yes.
- Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother.

442
00:46:11,653 --> 00:46:14,491
A throne would suit you ill.

443
00:46:18,288 --> 00:46:20,831
I've seen worlds
you've never known about.

444
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:25,519
I have grown, Odin's son, in my exile.

445
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:29,400
I have seen the true power of the
Tesseract. And when I wield it...

446
00:46:29,413 --> 00:46:34,206
Who showed you this power?
Who controls the would be king?

447
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:36,300
- I am the king!
- Not here!

448
00:46:36,497 --> 00:46:40,526
You give up the Tesseract!
You give up this poisonous dream!

449
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:45,147
You come home.

450
00:46:49,471 --> 00:46:51,583
I do not have it.

451
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:57,525
You need the cube to bring me home,
but I've sent it off. I know not where.

452
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,000
You listen well, brother.

453
00:47:01,749 --> 00:47:03,731
I'm listening.

454
00:47:12,149 --> 00:47:15,484
- Do not touch me again.
- Then don't take my stuff.

455
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,310
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

456
00:47:19,972 --> 00:47:21,786
Uh...Shakespeare in the park.

457
00:47:21,985 --> 00:47:25,483
Doth mother know,
you wear her drapes?

458
00:47:25,682 --> 00:47:28,323
This is beyond you, metal man.

459
00:47:28,518 --> 00:47:30,732
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

460
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,429
He gives up the cube and
he's all yours. Until then,

461
00:47:34,628 --> 00:47:36,607
stay out of the way.

462
00:47:37,466 --> 00:47:39,446
Tourist.

463
00:47:44,465 --> 00:47:46,446
Okay.

464
00:48:18,463 --> 00:48:20,478
How about that.

465
00:49:23,855 --> 00:49:25,836
Thats enough!

466
00:49:28,938 --> 00:49:30,831
- Now, I don't know what
you plan on doing here.

467
00:49:30,832 --> 00:49:32,801
- I've come here to put and
end to Loki's schemes!

468
00:49:32,999 --> 00:49:35,540
Then prove it.
Put that hammer down.

469
00:49:35,738 --> 00:49:38,941
Uh...yep! No! Bad call!
He loves his hammer!

470
00:49:40,196 --> 00:49:42,572
You want me to put the hammer down?

471
00:50:09,938 --> 00:50:11,918
Are we done here?

472
00:50:59,295 --> 00:51:04,211
In case it's unclear,
you try to escape,

473
00:51:05,892 --> 00:51:11,801
you so much as scratch that glass.

474
00:51:17,855 --> 00:51:22,129
Thirty thousand feet,
straight down in a steel trap.

475
00:51:22,328 --> 00:51:24,665
You get how that works?

476
00:51:26,635 --> 00:51:29,473
Ant.
Boot.

477
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,648
It's an impressive cage.

478
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:37,886
Not built, I think, for me.

479
00:51:38,087 --> 00:51:40,358
Built for something
a lot stronger than you.

480
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,562
Oh, I've heard.

481
00:51:43,597 --> 00:51:48,439
The mindless beast,
makes play to be the man.

482
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:54,048
How desperate are you?
You call on these lost creatures to defend you.

483
00:51:54,247 --> 00:51:56,719
How desperate am I?

484
00:51:56,919 --> 00:52:00,923
You threaten my world with war.
You steal a force you can't hope to control.

485
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:04,933
You talk about peace and you kill
cause it's fun.

486
00:52:05,133 --> 00:52:08,171
You have made me very desperate.

487
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:11,209
You might not be glad that you did.

488
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:17,219
Ooh. It burns you to come so close.

489
00:52:18,255 --> 00:52:24,098
To have the Tesseract,
to have power, unlimited power.

490
00:52:24,298 --> 00:52:26,301
And for what?

491
00:52:27,871 --> 00:52:31,242
A world for all mankind to share,

492
00:52:31,909 --> 00:52:35,918
- and then to be reminded
what real power is.

493
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:37,574
- Well let me know if real power
will want some magazine or something.

494
00:52:45,386 --> 00:52:50,423
- He really grows on you, doesn't he?
- Loki's gonna drag this out.

495
00:52:50,857 --> 00:52:55,296
- So, Thor, what's his play?
- He has an army called the Chitauri,

496
00:52:55,496 --> 00:52:58,700
that none of Asgard nor any world know.

497
00:52:58,899 --> 00:53:02,771
He means to lead them against your people.
They will win him the earth.

498
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:06,540
- Return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.
- An army,

499
00:53:06,743 --> 00:53:11,013
- from outer space.
- So he's building another portal.

500
00:53:11,214 --> 00:53:13,815
- That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.
- Selvig?

501
00:53:14,016 --> 00:53:16,220
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.

502
00:53:16,421 --> 00:53:19,157
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

503
00:53:19,356 --> 00:53:22,290
- along with one of ours.
- I wanna know why Loki let us take him.

504
00:53:22,492 --> 00:53:25,396
- He's not leading an army from here.
- I don't think we should be focusing on Loki.

505
00:53:25,596 --> 00:53:28,665
That guy's brain is a bag full
of cats, you could smell crazy on him.

506
00:53:28,868 --> 00:53:31,104
I don't care how you speak.

507
00:53:31,301 --> 00:53:35,040
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard, and he's my brother.

508
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,743
He killed eighty people in two days.

509
00:53:37,942 --> 00:53:41,380
- He's adopted.
- I think its about the mechanics.

510
00:53:41,582 --> 00:53:45,652
- Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for?
- It's a stabilizing agent.

511
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:53,859
Means the portal won't collapse on
itself, like it did at SHIELD.

512
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:57,229
No hard feelings Point Break,
you've got a mean swing.

513
00:53:57,431 --> 00:54:02,802
Also, it means the portal can open as wide,
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

514
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:08,909
That man is playing gallaga.

515
00:54:09,176 --> 00:54:13,183
Thought we wouldn't notice,
but we did.

516
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:17,186
- How does Fury even see these?
- He turns.

517
00:54:17,386 --> 00:54:19,388
Sounds exhausting.

518
00:54:19,987 --> 00:54:24,193
The rest of the raw materials,
Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.

519
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:27,364
Only major component
he still needs is a power source.

520
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:32,937
A high energy density,
something to kick start the cube.

521
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:36,140
When did you become an expert in
thermonuclear astrophysics?

522
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:39,310
Last night.
The packet, Selvig's notes,

523
00:54:39,508 --> 00:54:42,246
the Extraction Theory papers.
Am I the only one who did the reading?

524
00:54:42,448 --> 00:54:45,181
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

525
00:54:45,384 --> 00:54:47,694
He got to heat the cube to a
hundred and twenty million

526
00:54:47,695 --> 00:54:49,757
Kelvin just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

527
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:53,495
Unless, Selvig has figured out how to
stabilize the quantum tunnelling effect.

528
00:54:53,694 --> 00:54:57,429
Well, if he could do that he could achieve
Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.

529
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:59,967
Finally, someone who speaks English.

530
00:55:00,169 --> 00:55:04,438
- Is that what just happened?
- It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.

531
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,641
You're work on anti-electron
collisions is unparalleled.

532
00:55:07,841 --> 00:55:10,371
And I'm a huge fan of the
way you lose control

533
00:55:10,372 --> 00:55:12,847
and turn into an enormous
green rage monster.

534
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:17,151
- Thanks.
- Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube.

535
00:55:17,353 --> 00:55:19,953
- I was hoping you might join him.
- Let's start with that stick of his

536
00:55:20,158 --> 00:55:22,690
It may be magical, but it works
an awful lot like a Hydra weapon.

537
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:25,897
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the cube.

538
00:55:26,096 --> 00:55:28,956
And I'd like to know how Loki
used it to turn two of the

539
00:55:28,957 --> 00:55:31,666
sharpest men I know into his
personal flying monkeys.

540
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:35,405
- Monkeys? I do not understand.
- I do.

541
00:55:37,674 --> 00:55:40,177
- I understood that reference.

542
00:55:40,377 --> 00:55:43,549
- Shall we play it, Doctor?
- This way, Sir.

543
00:55:56,563 --> 00:55:58,215
The gamma readings are
definitely  consistent

544
00:55:58,216 --> 00:56:00,334
with Selvig's reports
on the Tesseract.

545
00:56:00,534 --> 00:56:03,703
- But it's gonna take weeks to process.
- If we bypass their mainframe

546
00:56:03,904 --> 00:56:09,209
and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster,
we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.

547
00:56:09,676 --> 00:56:12,514
All I packed was a tooth brush.

548
00:56:12,713 --> 00:56:16,619
You know, you should come by Stark Towers
sometime.Top ten floors, all R and D.

549
00:56:16,817 --> 00:56:21,156
- You'd love it, it's candy land.
- Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I

550
00:56:21,356 --> 00:56:23,824
kind of broke Harlem.

551
00:56:24,027 --> 00:56:26,695
Well, I promise a stress free
environment. No tension.

552
00:56:26,897 --> 00:56:28,965
No surprises.

553
00:56:30,268 --> 00:56:31,968
- Nothing?
- Are you nuts?

554
00:56:32,168 --> 00:56:35,072
You really have got a lid on it,
haven't you? What's your secret?

555
00:56:35,271 --> 00:56:38,677
- Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?
- Is everything a joke to you?

556
00:56:38,876 --> 00:56:42,846
- Threatening the safety of everyone on
this ship isn't funny.

557
00:56:43,049 --> 00:56:46,618
- No offense, Doctor.
- No, it....it's alright. I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't

558
00:56:46,818 --> 00:56:50,355
- handle pointy things.
- You're tiptoeing, big man.

559
00:56:50,554 --> 00:56:53,124
- You need to strut.
- And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark.

560
00:56:53,325 --> 00:56:56,464
You think I'm not?
Why did Fury call us and why now?

561
00:56:56,662 --> 00:56:59,465
Why not before?
What isn't he telling us.

562
00:56:59,665 --> 00:57:01,868
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

563
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:04,404
- You think Fury's hiding something?
- He is a spy.

564
00:57:04,605 --> 00:57:08,442
He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy.
His secrets have secrets.

565
00:57:08,643 --> 00:57:11,111
It's bugging him too, isn't it?

566
00:57:12,613 --> 00:57:16,452
- Uh, I just wanna finish my work here and...
- Doctor?

567
00:57:21,057 --> 00:57:25,793
A world for all mankind, Loki's jab
at Fury about the cube.

568
00:57:25,992 --> 00:57:29,464
- I heard it.
- Well, I think that was meant for you.

569
00:57:30,368 --> 00:57:34,571
Even if Barton didn't post that
all over the news.

570
00:57:34,771 --> 00:57:39,207
The Stark Tower? That big ugly......,
building in New York?

571
00:57:39,408 --> 00:57:43,081
It's powered by Stark Reactors,
self sustaining energy source.

572
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,517
- That building will run itself for what, a year?
- That's just the prototype.

573
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:51,390
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

574
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:54,159
So why didn't SHIELD bring him
in on the Tesseract project?

575
00:57:54,358 --> 00:57:57,496
I mean, What are they doing in the
energy business in the first place?

576
00:57:57,695 --> 00:58:00,671
I should probably look into that
once my decryption programme

577
00:58:00,672 --> 00:58:03,167
finishes breaking into all
of SHIELD's secure files.

578
00:58:03,366 --> 00:58:06,105
- I'm sorry, did you say.....?
- Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.

579
00:58:06,304 --> 00:58:09,241
In a few hours we'll know every dirty
secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide.

580
00:58:09,442 --> 00:58:12,176
- Blueberry?
- Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around?

581
00:58:12,377 --> 00:58:16,885
An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically not possible.

582
00:58:17,085 --> 00:58:19,321
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

583
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,757
This is a man who means to start a war,
and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed.

584
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,662
We have orders, we should follow them.

585
00:58:26,862 --> 00:58:29,464
Following is not really my style.

586
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,499
And you're all about style, aren't you?

587
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:36,806
Of the people in this room, which one is;
a-wearing a spangly outfit, and b- not of use?

588
00:58:37,007 --> 00:58:42,078
Steve, tell me none of
this smells a little funky to you?

589
00:58:44,281 --> 00:58:46,482
Just find the cube.

590
00:58:57,897 --> 00:59:00,131
That's the guy my dad
never shut up about?

591
00:59:00,332 --> 00:59:03,267
Wondering if they shouldn't have
kept him on ice.

592
00:59:03,902 --> 00:59:07,474
The guy's not wrong about Loki,
he does have the jump on us.

593
00:59:07,675 --> 00:59:10,543
What he's got is an acme dynamite kit.

594
00:59:10,744 --> 00:59:14,812
It's gonna blow up in his face,
and I'm gonna be there when it does..

595
00:59:15,515 --> 00:59:18,084
And I'll read all about it.

596
00:59:19,285 --> 00:59:21,919
Or you'll be suiting up like
the rest of us.

597
00:59:22,123 --> 00:59:25,658
Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor.

598
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:29,231
I'm exposed, like a nerve.

599
00:59:29,429 --> 00:59:33,198
- It's a nightmare.
- You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel,

600
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,139
trying every second to crawl
its way into my heart.

601
00:59:36,338 --> 00:59:39,876
This stops it. This little circle of light.

602
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:43,679
It's part of me now, not just armor.

603
00:59:44,277 --> 00:59:48,552
- It's a terrible privilege.
- But you can control it.

604
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:51,789
- Because I learned how.
- It's different.

605
00:59:52,223 --> 00:59:57,827
Hey, I've read all about your accident.
That much gammer exposure should have killed you.

606
00:59:58,028 --> 01:00:01,165
So you're saying that the Hulk,

607
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,501
the other guy, saved my life?

608
01:00:04,702 --> 01:00:08,005
That's nice.
It's a nice sentiment.

609
01:00:08,206 --> 01:00:10,976
Save it for what?

610
01:00:11,712 --> 01:00:13,877
I guess we'll find out.

611
01:00:15,382 --> 01:00:19,151
- You may not enjoy that.
- You just might.

612
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,352
As soon as Loki took
the doctor we moved Jane Foster.

613
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:24,279
We've got an excellent
observatory in Traunsee.

614
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,460
She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

615
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:31,830
Handsome fee, private plane,
very remote.

616
01:01:32,332 --> 01:01:35,234
- She'll be safe.
- Thank you.

617
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:39,606
It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig.

618
01:01:39,807 --> 01:01:42,276
I dread what he plans for him
once he's done.

619
01:01:42,476 --> 01:01:45,847
- Erik is a good man.
- He talks about you a lot.

620
01:01:46,649 --> 01:01:49,250
You changed his life.

621
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:54,557
- You changed everything around here.
- They were better as they were.

622
01:01:55,056 --> 01:01:57,959
We pretend on Asgard that we're more
advanced, but we.

623
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:00,795
We come here battling like Bilchsteim.

624
01:02:00,996 --> 01:02:06,636
- Like what?
- Bilchsteim. You know; huge,
scaly, big antlers.

625
01:02:06,838 --> 01:02:08,604
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.

626
01:02:08,807 --> 01:02:11,140
They are repulsive, and

627
01:02:12,075 --> 01:02:15,144
they trample everything in their path.

628
01:02:21,885 --> 01:02:27,625
When I first came to earth, Loki's rage
followed me here and your people paid the price.

629
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:30,363
And now again,

630
01:02:32,198 --> 01:02:35,034
n my youth I courted war.

631
01:02:36,468 --> 01:02:39,003
War hasn't started yet.

632
01:02:39,707 --> 01:02:42,609
You think you can make Loki tell us
what the Tesseract is?

633
01:02:42,809 --> 01:02:46,046
I do not know.
Loki's mind is far afield,

634
01:02:46,244 --> 01:02:50,650
it's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance upon me.

635
01:02:51,085 --> 01:02:54,021
There's no pain that would prise
his need from him.

636
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:59,061
A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops.

637
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:05,434
- What are you asking me to do?
- I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?

638
01:03:05,635 --> 01:03:06,769
Loki is a prisoner.

639
01:03:06,901 --> 01:03:11,474
Then why do I feel like he's the only person
on this boat that wants to be here?

640
01:03:23,454 --> 01:03:26,457
There's not many people
that can sneak up on me.

641
01:03:26,659 --> 01:03:31,261
-But you figured I'd come after.

642
01:03:31,462 --> 01:03:34,633
After whatever tortures
Fury can concoct,

643
01:03:34,833 --> 01:03:38,671
you would appear as a friend,
as a balm.

644
01:03:39,639 --> 01:03:43,508
- And I would cooperate.
- I wanna know what you've done to Agent Barton.

645
01:03:43,676 --> 01:03:46,779
I'd say I've expanded his mind.

646
01:03:48,178 --> 01:03:53,188
And once you've won.
Once you're king of the mountain.

647
01:03:54,255 --> 01:03:57,255
What happens to his mind?

648
01:03:58,091 --> 01:04:03,432
- Is this love, Agent Romanoff?
- Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

649
01:04:06,666 --> 01:04:08,670
Tell me.

650
01:04:12,808 --> 01:04:16,078
Before I worked for SHIELD, I

651
01:04:19,948 --> 01:04:25,456
I made a name for myself.
I have a very specific skillset.

652
01:04:25,658 --> 01:04:30,094
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

653
01:04:30,293 --> 01:04:33,630
I got on SHIELD's radar in a bad way.

654
01:04:34,901 --> 01:04:37,902
Agent Barton was sent to kill me,

655
01:04:38,902 --> 01:04:40,905
he made a different call.

656
01:04:43,114 --> 01:04:46,448
And what will you do
if I vow to spare him?

657
01:04:46,718 --> 01:04:50,752
- I'll not let you out.
- Ah, no. But I like this

658
01:04:50,951 --> 01:04:54,355
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man?

659
01:04:54,556 --> 01:04:59,092
Regime's fall everyday.
I tend not to weep over that,
I'm Russian,

660
01:04:59,293 --> 01:05:01,395
Or I was.

661
01:05:01,594 --> 01:05:06,528
- And what are you now?
- It's really not that complicated.

662
01:05:06,797 --> 01:05:11,137
I've got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.

663
01:05:11,901 --> 01:05:13,903
Can you?

664
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:18,107
Can you wipe out that much red?

665
01:05:19,776 --> 01:05:21,943
Drakoff's daughter?

666
01:05:22,876 --> 01:05:24,879
Sao Paulo?

667
01:05:25,812 --> 01:05:27,813
The hospital file?

668
01:05:29,082 --> 01:05:31,417
Barton told me everything.

669
01:05:31,615 --> 01:05:34,552
Your ledger is dripping,
it's gushing red,

670
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:38,787
and you think saving a man no more virtuous
than yourself will change anything?

671
01:05:38,987 --> 01:05:41,492
This is the basest sentimentality.

672
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:45,793
This is a child at prayer.
Pathetic.

673
01:05:45,995 --> 01:05:48,729
You lie and kill

674
01:05:48,931 --> 01:05:52,631
in the service of liars and killers.

675
01:05:54,932 --> 01:05:58,169
You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,

676
01:05:58,403 --> 01:06:01,072
something that makes up for the horrors.

677
01:06:02,038 --> 01:06:04,406
But they are a part of you,

678
01:06:04,608 --> 01:06:08,277
and they will never go away.

679
01:06:09,245 --> 01:06:12,412
I won't barter Barton!
Not until I make him kill you.

680
01:06:12,613 --> 01:06:17,283
Slowly, intimately,
in every way he knows you fear.

681
01:06:17,483 --> 01:06:20,451
And then he'll wake just long enough
to see his good work,

682
01:06:20,653 --> 01:06:24,053
and when he screams
I'll split his skull

683
01:06:24,256 --> 01:06:27,257
This is my bargain,
you mewling quin!

684
01:06:28,925 --> 01:06:30,927
You're a monster.

685
01:06:32,728 --> 01:06:34,995
Oh, no.

686
01:06:35,196 --> 01:06:37,531
You brought the monster.

687
01:06:39,764 --> 01:06:45,201
- So, Banner? That's your play?
- What?

688
01:06:45,402 --> 01:06:48,673
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.
Keep Banner in the lab, I'm on my way.

689
01:06:48,873 --> 01:06:50,873
Set the door locked.

690
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:55,146
Thank you, for your cooperation.

691
01:07:02,881 --> 01:07:06,886
- What are you doing, Mr. Stark?
- kind of been wondering the same thing about you

692
01:07:07,086 --> 01:07:09,037
- You're supposed to be
locating the Tesseract.

693
01:07:09,038 --> 01:07:11,924
- We are, the model's locked and we're
sweeping for the signature now.

694
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:15,259
When we get a hit, we'll have the
location within half a mile.

695
01:07:15,459 --> 01:07:19,127
And you'll get your cube back,
no muss, no fuss.

696
01:07:19,796 --> 01:07:21,798
What is Phase 2?

697
01:07:23,198 --> 01:07:25,968
Phase 2 is SHIELD used
the cube to make weapons.

698
01:07:26,168 --> 01:07:28,387
-Sorry, the computer was
moving a little slow for me.

699
01:07:28,388 --> 01:07:31,305
-Rogers, we gathered everything related
to the Tesseract.This does not

700
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:34,906
\ - mean that we're./
- I'm sorry, Nick.
What were you lying?

701
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:39,344
- I was wrong, Director. The world hasn't changed a bit.
- Do you know about this?

702
01:07:39,543 --> 01:07:42,582
- You wanna think about removing
yourself from this environment, doctor?

703
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:44,581
- I was in Calcutta, I
was pretty well removed.

704
01:07:44,782 --> 01:07:47,317
- Loki's manipulating you.
- And you've been doing what exactly?

705
01:07:47,516 --> 01:07:49,541
- You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

706
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:51,986
- Yes, and I'm not leaving because
suddenly you get a little twitchy.

707
01:07:52,185 --> 01:07:57,891
I'd like to know why SHIELD is using
the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.

708
01:07:58,323 --> 01:08:00,325
Because of him.

709
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:04,997
- Me?
- Last year earth had a visitor
from another planet

710
01:08:05,194 --> 01:08:08,398
who had a grudge mass
that levelled a small town.

711
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:13,770
We learned that not only are we not alone,
but we are hopelessly, hilariously

712
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:16,604
- out gunned.
- My people want nothing but peace with your planet.

713
01:08:16,805 --> 01:08:21,053
But you're not the only people out there, are you?
And, you're not the only threat.

714
01:08:21,257 --> 01:08:24,837
The world's filling up with
people who can't be matched,

715
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:27,347
- they can't be controlled.
- Like you controlled the cube?

716
01:08:27,548 --> 01:08:31,632
You're work with the Tesseract is
what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

717
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:33,738
It is the signal to
all the realms that the

718
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:35,682
earth is ready for a higher form of war.

719
01:08:35,883 --> 01:08:38,929
- A higher form?
- You forced our hand.We had to come up with something.

720
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:42,578
A nuclear deterrent.
cause that always calms everything right down.

721
01:08:42,778 --> 01:08:45,154
Remind me again
how you made your fortune, Stark?

722
01:08:45,353 --> 01:08:47,661
- I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck deep...

723
01:08:47,662 --> 01:08:49,401
- Wait, Wait, Hold on.
How is this now about me?

724
01:08:49,604 --> 01:08:52,550
- I'm sorry, isn't everything?
- I thought humans were more evolved than this.

725
01:08:52,752 --> 01:08:57,537
- Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?
- We can..

726
01:09:39,273 --> 01:09:43,157
- You speak of control, yet you court chaos.
- It's his M.O., isn't it?

727
01:09:43,357 --> 01:09:47,641
I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no.
We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos.

728
01:09:47,842 --> 01:09:49,885
We're...we're a time-bomb.

729
01:09:50,084 --> 01:09:53,600
- You need to step away.
- Why shouldn't they guy let off a little steam?

730
01:09:53,801 --> 01:09:58,353
- You know damn well why! Back off!
- Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.

731
01:09:58,554 --> 01:10:01,867
Yeah, big man in a suit of armor.

732
01:10:02,535 --> 01:10:06,820
- Take that off, what are you?
- Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.

733
01:10:07,021 --> 01:10:10,266
I know guys with none of
that worth ten of you.

734
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:14,819
I've seen the footage.
The only thing you really
fight for is yourself.

735
01:10:15,021 --> 01:10:17,352
You're not the guy to make
the sacrifice play, to lay

736
01:10:17,353 --> 01:10:19,639
down on a wire and let the
other guy crawl over you.

737
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:22,016
I think I would just cut the wire.

738
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:26,600
Always a way out.

739
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:30,449
You know, you may not be a threat,
but you better stop pretending to be a hero

740
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:32,928
A hero, like you?

741
01:10:33,129 --> 01:10:38,819
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.
Everything special about you came out of a bottle.

742
01:11:04,154 --> 01:11:07,167
Put on the suite,
let's go a few rounds.

743
01:11:08,105 --> 01:11:12,355
- You people are so petty, and tiny.
- Yes, right.

744
01:11:12,556 --> 01:11:17,039
- Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr. Banner back to his
- Where? You're renting my room.

745
01:11:17,242 --> 01:11:20,286
- The cell was just...
- In case you needed to kill me.

746
01:11:20,488 --> 01:11:23,835
but you can't! I know, I tried.

747
01:11:26,112 --> 01:11:28,019
I got low,

748
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:33,205
I didn't see an end, so I put a bullet
in my mouth and the other guy spit it out.

749
01:11:34,278 --> 01:11:37,426
So I moved on, I focused on
helping other people.

750
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:41,007
I was good until you dragged me
back into this freak show.

751
01:11:41,206 --> 01:11:44,295
and put everyone here at risk.
You wanna know my secret,

752
01:11:44,296 --> 01:11:46,896
Agent Romanoff?
You wanna know how I stay calm?

753
01:11:49,308 --> 01:11:51,414
Dr. Banner.

754
01:11:52,285 --> 01:11:54,393
put down the scepter.

755
01:12:01,188 --> 01:12:03,297
All right.

756
01:12:03,599 --> 01:12:07,213
- Sorry, kids. You don't get to see
my party trick after all.
- Located the Tesseract?

757
01:12:07,413 --> 01:12:09,589
- I can get there faster.
- The Tesseract belongs on Asgard,

758
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:11,499
- no human is a match for it.
- You're not going alone!

759
01:12:11,697 --> 01:12:13,103
You gonna stop me?
Put on the suit, let's find out.

760
01:12:13,304 --> 01:12:16,686
- I'm not afraid to hit an old man.
- Put on the suit.

761
01:12:18,726 --> 01:12:20,836
Oh, my God.

762
01:12:35,965 --> 01:12:38,340
- Put on the suit!
- Yep.

763
01:12:47,178 --> 01:12:50,893
- Hill!
- Its a detonation. Number three engines is down.

764
01:12:51,093 --> 01:12:53,301
-We're been hit.
-Fire engines.

765
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:55,912
- Talk to me.
- Turbine looks mostly intact, -

766
01:12:56,113 --> 01:12:59,360
but it is impossible to get out there and
repair when we already there.

767
01:12:59,561 --> 01:13:02,068
If we lose one of engine we wont be.

768
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:05,385
- Someone gonna get outside and patch the engine.
- Stark, did you capy that?

769
01:13:05,584 --> 01:13:09,668
- I'm on it.

770
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:17,735
Okay.

771
01:13:19,743 --> 01:13:21,851
You okay right?

772
01:13:33,768 --> 01:13:37,147
Keep that engine down. Attention.
wait the cameras going dark.

773
01:13:37,347 --> 01:13:39,456
Stay close.

774
01:13:40,695 --> 01:13:42,836
Level four.

775
01:13:43,037 --> 01:13:45,483
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

776
01:13:53,219 --> 01:13:55,326
Doctor.

777
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:59,308
Bruce, you gotta fight.

778
01:13:59,505 --> 01:14:01,720
This is just what Loki wants.

779
01:14:03,073 --> 01:14:07,105
We're gonna be okay. Listen to me.

780
01:14:08,756 --> 01:14:10,738
We're gonna be okay. Right?

781
01:14:10,936 --> 01:14:13,376
I swear on my life
I will get you out of this,

782
01:14:13,378 --> 01:14:15,197
you will walk away, and never...

783
01:14:15,395 --> 01:14:17,475
Your life?

784
01:14:34,124 --> 01:14:36,205
Bruce.

785
01:15:11,649 --> 01:15:15,910
We have been carrying 180 to the south.
Takes us to the water.

786
01:15:16,107 --> 01:15:18,884
Free wind. Navigation
recalibration after the engine failure.

787
01:15:19,082 --> 01:15:22,019
- Is the sun coming up?
- Yes sir.

788
01:15:22,218 --> 01:15:25,590
Then put it on the left.
Takes us on the water.

789
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:28,527
One more turbine goes down
we're trapped.

790
01:15:34,836 --> 01:15:36,918
Stark!

791
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:41,807
- Stark, I'm here!
- Good.

792
01:15:43,097 --> 01:15:45,076
See what we got.

793
01:15:45,275 --> 01:15:48,051
I gotta get this super conducting
cooling system back online

794
01:15:48,246 --> 01:15:52,013
before I can access the rotors and 
work on dislodging the debris.

795
01:15:53,963 --> 01:15:56,233
I need you to get to that
engine control panel and

796
01:15:56,234 --> 01:15:58,325
tell me which relays are
in overload position.

797
01:16:11,668 --> 01:16:13,749
What's it look like in there?

798
01:16:13,981 --> 01:16:16,424
It seems to run on some form of
electricity.

799
01:16:16,623 --> 01:16:18,703
Well, you're not wrong.

800
01:17:22,058 --> 01:17:24,934
We're not your enemies, Banner.

801
01:17:25,132 --> 01:17:27,343
Try to think.

802
01:17:36,099 --> 01:17:38,214
The relays are intact.

803
01:17:38,408 --> 01:17:40,821
- What's our next move?
- Even if I clear the rotors,

804
01:17:41,022 --> 01:17:43,100
this thing won't re-engage
without a jump.

805
01:17:43,297 --> 01:17:44,607
- I'm gonna have to get
in there and push.

806
01:17:44,608 --> 01:17:46,436
- Well if that thing gets up
to speed, you'll get shredded.

807
01:17:46,634 --> 01:17:49,079
Then stay in the control unit and reverse
polarity long enough to disengage mag..

808
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:52,384
- Speak English.

809
01:17:53,078 --> 01:17:55,190
See that red lever?

810
01:17:55,392 --> 01:17:57,504
It'll slow the rotors down long
enough for me to get out.

811
01:17:57,699 --> 01:18:00,309
Stand by it, wait for my word.

812
01:18:51,876 --> 01:18:54,515
I need full evac on lower deck.

813
01:18:57,193 --> 01:18:59,273
Grenade.

814
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:16,515
We gotta perimeter breach.
Hostile wiped SHIELD gear.

815
01:19:26,358 --> 01:19:29,992
Hulk and Thor are in the research
level 4, level 2 and 3.

816
01:19:30,192 --> 01:19:32,734
Sir, the Hulk will tear
this place apart!

817
01:19:33,758 --> 01:19:38,716
- Get his attention.
- Escorts, Six o proceed to the.

818
01:19:38,912 --> 01:19:41,752
- Don't get too close.

819
01:19:53,446 --> 01:19:55,526
Target acquired.

820
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:01,670
Target engaged.

821
01:20:12,076 --> 01:20:14,586
Target in moving.

822
01:21:42,419 --> 01:21:45,125
Engine now all shut down.

823
01:21:55,468 --> 01:21:57,646
Sir we lost all engine one.

824
01:21:57,844 --> 01:22:02,206
It's Barton. He took out our system.
He's headed for the detention lab.

825
01:22:02,404 --> 01:22:04,385
Does anybody copy?

826
01:22:05,543 --> 01:22:09,406
This is Agent Romanoff.I copy.

827
01:22:13,767 --> 01:22:17,069
- Stark,we losing altitude.
- I have noticed.

828
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,292
No!

829
01:22:53,999 --> 01:22:57,272
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

830
01:23:39,518 --> 01:23:45,132
The humans think us immortal.
Should we test that?

831
01:23:47,247 --> 01:23:49,295
Move away please.

832
01:23:52,864 --> 01:23:55,208
Do you like this?

833
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:59,171
We started working on the prototype
after you sent The Destroyer.

834
01:23:59,831 --> 01:24:02,278
Even I don't know what it does.

835
01:24:02,936 --> 01:24:04,987
Do you wanna find out?

836
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:08,189
No!

837
01:25:17,061 --> 01:25:19,141
Natasha ...

838
01:25:50,061 --> 01:25:52,174
You're gonna lose.

839
01:25:53,892 --> 01:25:56,005
Am I?

840
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,782
It's in your nature.

841
01:26:01,058 --> 01:26:06,974
You're heroes are scattered, your 
floating fortress falls from the sky.

842
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:12,061
- Where is my disadvantage?
- Your lack conviction.

843
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,736
I don't think I...

844
01:26:20,418 --> 01:26:22,695
So that's what it does.

845
01:26:54,936 --> 01:26:58,141
- Cap, need a lever.
- I need a minute here!

846
01:26:58,932 --> 01:27:02,103
Lever, now!

847
01:27:49,836 --> 01:27:53,303
I'm sorry, boss. They got rabbited.

848
01:27:53,499 --> 01:27:56,344
Just stay awake. Eyes on me

849
01:27:56,541 --> 01:28:00,141
- No, I'm clockin' out here
- Not an option.

850
01:28:00,803 --> 01:28:03,611
It's okay, boss.

851
01:28:04,603 --> 01:28:10,512
This was never gonna work
if they didn't have something to.....

852
01:28:40,628 --> 01:28:43,283
Agent Coulson is down.

853
01:28:43,881 --> 01:28:47,763
- The medical team on the way to the location.
- They're here.

854
01:29:08,499 --> 01:29:11,121
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

855
01:29:13,277 --> 01:29:16,692
Guess he never did get you to sign them.

856
01:29:18,950 --> 01:29:23,893
We're dead in the air up here.
Our communications, location of the cube,

857
01:29:24,191 --> 01:29:29,665
Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you.

858
01:29:29,964 --> 01:29:33,116
Lost my one good eye.

859
01:29:35,606 --> 01:29:37,994
Maybe I had that coming.

860
01:29:43,103 --> 01:29:45,128
Yes.

861
01:29:45,424 --> 01:29:49,339
We were going to build
an arsenal with the Tesseract.

862
01:29:49,402 --> 01:29:51,960
I never put all my chips
on that number though,

863
01:29:51,961 --> 01:29:54,412
because I was playing
something even riskier.

864
01:29:58,227 --> 01:30:02,571
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

865
01:30:04,398 --> 01:30:07,716
called The Avengers Initiative.

866
01:30:08,943 --> 01:30:13,586
The idea was to bring together
a group of remarkable people,

867
01:30:14,482 --> 01:30:17,435
see if they could become
something more.

868
01:30:18,732 --> 01:30:22,247
See if they could work together
when we needed them to,

869
01:30:22,677 --> 01:30:25,696
to fight the battles
that we never could.

870
01:30:29,181 --> 01:30:33,792
Phil Coulson died still
believing in that idea,

871
01:30:36,047 --> 01:30:38,404
in heroes.

872
01:30:46,489 --> 01:30:51,444
Well, it's an old fashioned notion.

873
01:31:12,382 --> 01:31:15,201
You fell out of the sky.

874
01:31:28,937 --> 01:31:33,516
- Did I hurt anybody?
- There's nobody around here to get hurt.

875
01:31:33,882 --> 01:31:36,701
You did scare the hell out
of some pigeons though.

876
01:31:37,229 --> 01:31:39,914
- Lucky.
- Or just good aim.

877
01:31:40,147 --> 01:31:42,601
You were awake when you fell.

878
01:31:43,563 --> 01:31:47,181
- You saw?
- The whole thing, right through the ceiling.

879
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:51,525
Big and green and buck ass nude.

880
01:31:51,759 --> 01:31:53,715
Here...

881
01:31:54,015 --> 01:31:58,494
I didn't think those would fit you until
you shrunk down to a regular size fella.

882
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,338
Thank you.

883
01:32:03,635 --> 01:32:06,358
- Are you an alien?
- What?

884
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:10,072
- From outer space, an alien?
- No.

885
01:32:10,371 --> 01:32:14,086
Well then, son.
You've got a condition.

886
01:32:24,004 --> 01:32:27,060
Clint, You're gonna be alright.

887
01:32:29,647 --> 01:32:34,491
You know that? Is that what you know?

888
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:40,396
I got...I gotta go in though.

889
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,454
I gotta flush him out.

890
01:32:42,652 --> 01:32:46,467
- We don't have that long, it's gonna take time.
- I don't understand.

891
01:32:48,126 --> 01:32:51,444
Have you ever had someone
take your brain and play?

892
01:32:52,339 --> 01:32:56,055
Pull you out and
send something else in?

893
01:32:59,441 --> 01:33:01,663
Do you know what
it's like to be unmade?

894
01:33:03,354 --> 01:33:05,776
You know that I do.

895
01:33:13,306 --> 01:33:16,990
Why am I back? How did you get him out?

896
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:19,645
Cognitive recalibration.

897
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:22,432
I hit you really hard in the head.

898
01:33:23,061 --> 01:33:25,417
Thanks.

899
01:33:27,974 --> 01:33:29,963
Natasha,

900
01:33:30,559 --> 01:33:35,470
- how many agents?
- Don't. Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

901
01:33:35,998 --> 01:33:37,792
This is Loki.

902
01:33:37,926 --> 01:33:42,733
This is monsters and magic and
nothing we were ever trained for.

903
01:33:43,133 --> 01:33:47,282
- Loki, he got away?
- Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?

904
01:33:47,481 --> 01:33:51,626
I didn't need to know. I didn't ask.

905
01:33:55,614 --> 01:33:59,494
He's gonna make his play soon though.
Today.

906
01:33:59,695 --> 01:34:02,580
- We gotta stop him.
- Yeah? Who's we?

907
01:34:02,781 --> 01:34:05,401
I don't know. Who's ever left.

908
01:34:08,884 --> 01:34:13,694
Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's eye socket,
I'd sleep better I suppose.

909
01:34:16,879 --> 01:34:18,870
Now you sound like you.

910
01:34:19,170 --> 01:34:21,193
But you don't.

911
01:34:22,486 --> 01:34:25,339
You're a spy, not a soldier.

912
01:34:25,638 --> 01:34:30,082
Now you want to wade into a war.
Why?

913
01:34:31,942 --> 01:34:34,063
What did Loki do to you?

914
01:34:34,561 --> 01:34:37,383
He didn't, I just...

915
01:34:40,668 --> 01:34:42,724
Natasha.

916
01:34:44,284 --> 01:34:48,199
I've been compromised.

917
01:34:49,395 --> 01:34:52,147
I got red in my ledger,

918
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:55,797
I'd like to wipe it out.

919
01:35:11,753 --> 01:35:14,443
- Was he married?
- No

920
01:35:14,905 --> 01:35:19,353
He was a...cellist, I think.

921
01:35:20,612 --> 01:35:24,559
I'm sorry. He seemed
like a good man.

922
01:35:25,756 --> 01:35:28,940
- He was an idiot.
- Why? For believing?

923
01:35:29,138 --> 01:35:32,458
- For taking on Loki alone.
- He was doing his job.

924
01:35:32,756 --> 01:35:36,538
He was out of his league.
He should have waited. He should have...

925
01:35:36,705 --> 01:35:40,220
- Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.
- Right. How did that work for him?

926
01:35:40,487 --> 01:35:44,466
- Is this the first time you've lost a soldier?
- We're not soldiers!

927
01:35:48,317 --> 01:35:51,137
- I'm not marching to Fury's fife.
- Neither am I.

928
01:35:51,301 --> 01:35:53,556
He's got the same blood on
his hands that Loki does,

929
01:35:53,855 --> 01:35:56,977
but right now we gotta put that
behind us and get this done.

930
01:35:57,273 --> 01:36:00,823
Now Loki needs a power source,
if we can put together a list...
He made it personal.

931
01:36:01,023 --> 01:36:04,509
- That's not the point.
- That is the point. That's Loki's point.

932
01:36:04,672 --> 01:36:07,591
- He hit us all right where we live. Why?
- To tear us apart.

933
01:36:07,724 --> 01:36:12,169
He had to conquer his greed,
but he knows he has
to take us out to win, right?

934
01:36:12,301 --> 01:36:16,185
That's what he wants. He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

935
01:36:16,483 --> 01:36:20,466
- He wants an audience.
- Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

936
01:36:20,861 --> 01:36:22,905
Yeah. That's just
previews, this is...

937
01:36:22,906 --> 01:36:25,839
this is opening night.
And Loki, he's a full-tail diva.

938
01:36:26,134 --> 01:36:28,443
He wants flowers, he wants
parades, he wants a

939
01:36:28,444 --> 01:36:31,046
monument built to the skies
with his name plastered.

940
01:36:33,139 --> 01:36:35,129
I hope that would be true.

941
01:36:45,745 --> 01:36:47,568
- Time to go.
- Go where?

942
01:36:47,702 --> 01:36:50,258
I'll tell you on the way.
Can you fly one of those jets?

943
01:36:51,153 --> 01:36:53,177
I can.

944
01:36:56,428 --> 01:36:59,911
You got a suit? Yeah.
Then suit up.

945
01:37:27,315 --> 01:37:31,628
- You guys aren't authorized to be in here.
- Son, just don't.

946
01:37:34,111 --> 01:37:36,121
Sir.
Done is jacket.

947
01:37:36,333 --> 01:37:36,334
<Ranugal>

948
01:37:36,335 --> 01:37:36,336
<Ranugal>

949
01:37:41,101 --> 01:37:43,444
They needed to push.

950
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:54,566
They found it. Get our communications
back up whatever you have to do.

951
01:37:54,935 --> 01:37:58,285
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes sir.

952
01:38:13,593 --> 01:38:16,373
This device has already self sustainig.

953
01:38:16,508 --> 01:38:21,564
- Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.
- It's too late.

954
01:38:22,906 --> 01:38:27,595
It can't stop now.
He wants to show us something!

955
01:38:27,964 --> 01:38:31,850
- A new universe.
- Okay.

956
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:42,536
The barrier is pure energy.
It's unbreachable.

957
01:38:42,705 --> 01:38:44,877
Yeah I get that.

958
01:38:45,718 --> 01:38:47,727
Plan B.

959
01:38:47,896 --> 01:38:50,138
- Sir, mark 7 is not
ready for deployment.

960
01:38:50,139 --> 01:38:52,953
- Then skip the spinning ring.
We're run out of clock.

961
01:39:12,047 --> 01:39:15,395
Please tell me you're going
to appeal to my humanity.

962
01:39:16,167 --> 01:39:20,401
- Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten.
- You should have left your armor on for that.

963
01:39:20,414 --> 01:39:25,300
Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage.
You've got the blue stick of destiny.

964
01:39:28,322 --> 01:39:31,578
- Stalling me won't change anything.
- No, no, no! Threatening.

965
01:39:36,056 --> 01:39:40,444
The Chitauri are coming,
nothing will change that.

966
01:39:40,981 --> 01:39:44,330
- What have I to fear?
- The Avengers.

967
01:39:46,207 --> 01:39:50,663
It's what we call ourselves, sort of like a team.
Earth's Mightiest Heroes type of thing.

968
01:39:50,797 --> 01:39:55,787
- Yes, I've met them.
- Yeah, takes us a while to get
any traction, I'll give you that one.

969
01:39:55,921 --> 01:40:00,910
But, let's do a head count here.
Your brother, the demi-God

970
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:06,238
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend

971
01:40:06,406 --> 01:40:09,621
a man with breath-taking
anger management issues

972
01:40:09,791 --> 01:40:13,305
a couple of master assassins,
and you, big fella

973
01:40:13,442 --> 01:40:16,322
you've managed to piss off
every single one of them.

974
01:40:16,489 --> 01:40:19,438
- That was the plan.
- Not a great plan.

975
01:40:19,569 --> 01:40:24,827
When they come, and they will,
they'll come for you.

976
01:40:24,965 --> 01:40:27,410
- I have an army.
- We have a Hulk.

977
01:40:27,541 --> 01:40:31,093
-I thought the beast had wandered off.
-You're missing the point. There's no throne,

978
01:40:31,229 --> 01:40:34,944
there is no version of this,
where you come out on top.

979
01:40:35,415 --> 01:40:39,969
Maybe your army comes and
maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you.

980
01:40:40,472 --> 01:40:44,728
Because if we can't protect the Earth,
you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.

981
01:40:46,669 --> 01:40:49,750
How will your friends have time for me,

982
01:40:49,919 --> 01:40:52,597
when they're so busy fighting you?

983
01:40:59,231 --> 01:41:04,122
- It should work!
- Well, performance issues. You know?

984
01:41:06,568 --> 01:41:09,783
Jarvis, anytime now.

985
01:41:11,359 --> 01:41:15,580
- You will all fall before me.

986
01:41:44,521 --> 01:41:48,239
And there's one other person
you pissed off!

987
01:41:48,707 --> 01:41:50,887
His name is Phil.

988
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:17,649
Right.
Army.

989
01:43:29,201 --> 01:43:33,821
Loki, turn off the Tesseract or
I'll destroy it! You can't.

990
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:35,835
There is no stopping it.

991
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,387
- There is only the war!
- So be it.

992
01:44:02,302 --> 01:44:06,021
- Stark, we're heading north east.
- What, did you stop for drive-through?

993
01:44:06,155 --> 01:44:09,537
Swing that park,
I'm gonna lay them out for you.

994
01:44:26,119 --> 01:44:30,509
- So we have more incoming.
- Lets keep them occupied.

995
01:44:36,371 --> 01:44:39,754
- Nat.
- Did you see them?

996
01:45:22,629 --> 01:45:25,310
We need back up there.

997
01:46:15,026 --> 01:46:19,681
- Stark, are you seeing this?
- I'm seeing, still working on believing..

998
01:46:19,882 --> 01:46:22,462
- Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?
- Banner?

999
01:46:22,664 --> 01:46:27,185
Just keep me posted.
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

1000
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:32,917
Look at this. Look around you.

1001
01:46:33,121 --> 01:46:36,737
You think this madness will end
with your rule?

1002
01:46:36,938 --> 01:46:41,361
It's too late.
It's too late to stop it.

1003
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:45,647
No. We can, together.

1004
01:46:52,048 --> 01:46:54,057
Sentiment!

1005
01:47:21,892 --> 01:47:24,169
You got civilian trap in the roof.

1006
01:47:25,409 --> 01:47:27,418
Loki.

1007
01:47:37,770 --> 01:47:40,217
There more down there.

1008
01:47:45,271 --> 01:47:48,993
- We got this. Go Go.
- You think you can hold them off?

1009
01:47:49,161 --> 01:47:51,169
Captain,

1010
01:47:51,873 --> 01:47:54,285
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1011
01:48:21,754 --> 01:48:27,280
- Just like Budapest all over again!
- You and I remember Budapest very differently.

1012
01:48:45,336 --> 01:48:47,346
National guard?

1013
01:48:48,150 --> 01:48:50,190
Does the army know what's happening here?

1014
01:48:50,395 --> 01:48:51,966
Do we?

1015
01:48:52,170 --> 01:48:56,255
I need men in these buildings. There are
people inside that can run into the line of fire.

1016
01:48:56,455 --> 01:49:00,074
You take them through the basement or
through the subway, you keep them off the streets

1017
01:49:00,276 --> 01:49:05,633
- I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.
- Why the hell should I take orders from you?

1018
01:49:18,564 --> 01:49:21,980
I need men in those buildings,
lead the people down and away from the streets

1019
01:49:22,182 --> 01:49:25,531
I wanna shut off the perimeter
all the way down of 39 Street.

1020
01:49:34,978 --> 01:49:38,998
Well, we got its attention.
Where it heads to?

1021
01:50:07,349 --> 01:50:10,466
- Lets Thor hear what says.
- The powers surrounding the cube is impenetrable

1022
01:50:10,664 --> 01:50:13,005
Thor is right,
we gotta deal with these guys.

1023
01:50:13,207 --> 01:50:16,854
- How do we do this? As a team.
- I have unfinished business with Loki.

1024
01:50:17,056 --> 01:50:19,196
- Yeah, get in line.
- Save it.

1025
01:50:19,398 --> 01:50:21,369
Save it. Loki's gonna keep
this fight focused on us and

1026
01:50:21,370 --> 01:50:23,517
that's what we need.
Without him these things could run wild.

1027
01:50:23,718 --> 01:50:26,898
We got Stark up top,
he's gonna need us...

1028
01:50:34,161 --> 01:50:38,177
So, this all seems horrible.

1029
01:50:38,511 --> 01:50:40,989
- I've seen worse.
- Sorry.

1030
01:50:41,188 --> 01:50:44,134
No, we could use a little worse.

1031
01:50:44,335 --> 01:50:46,678
- Stark, we got him,
- Banne.

1032
01:50:46,878 --> 01:50:52,233
-  just like you said.
- Tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.

1033
01:50:57,521 --> 01:51:00,403
I don't see how that's a party.

1034
01:51:07,497 --> 01:51:09,503
Dr. Banner,

1035
01:51:10,176 --> 01:51:12,685
Dr. Banner, now might be a
good time for you to get angry.

1036
01:51:12,886 --> 01:51:15,429
That's my secret, Captain.

1037
01:51:17,104 --> 01:51:19,113
I'm always angry.

1038
01:51:30,258 --> 01:51:32,268
Hold on.

1039
01:52:01,183 --> 01:52:03,521
Send the rest.

1040
01:52:09,615 --> 01:52:12,090
Guys.
- Call it, Captain.

1041
01:52:12,293 --> 01:52:16,375
Alright, listen up. Until we can close
that portal up there, we're gonna use containment.

1042
01:52:16,577 --> 01:52:19,856
Barton, I want you on that roof, eyes on
everything. Call out patterns and strays.

1043
01:52:20,026 --> 01:52:22,410
Stark, you got the perimeter.
Anything gets more than three

1044
01:52:22,411 --> 01:52:24,477
blocks out, you turn it back
or your turn it to ash.

1045
01:52:24,673 --> 01:52:28,359
- Wanna give me a lift?
- Right. Better clench up, Legoolas.

1046
01:52:30,737 --> 01:52:34,284
Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck
that portal, slow them down.

1047
01:52:34,483 --> 01:52:37,831
You've got the lightning,
light the bastards up.

1048
01:52:39,235 --> 01:52:42,211
You and me, we stay here on the ground,
keep the fighting here. And

1049
01:52:42,311 --> 01:52:42,889
Hulk,

1050
01:52:44,316 --> 01:52:47,310
SMASH.

1051
01:53:39,454 --> 01:53:41,277
Sir.

1052
01:53:47,331 --> 01:53:51,318
Stark, you have a lot of
Strand out here.

1053
01:53:52,282 --> 01:53:56,932
- I try to keep them off the streets.
- But they cant bang with the them.

1054
01:53:57,129 --> 01:54:00,453
- Find the ....
- I will roger that.

1055
01:54:22,810 --> 01:54:24,801
Oh, boy.

1056
01:54:31,147 --> 01:54:33,704
Nice call, what else do you got?

1057
01:54:33,903 --> 01:54:36,860
We force taking out the squadron on 6.

1058
01:54:37,060 --> 01:54:39,750
And it didn't invite me.

1059
01:55:19,015 --> 01:55:21,870
Captain, none of this is gonna
mean a damn thing if we don't close that portal.

1060
01:55:22,073 --> 01:55:25,988
- Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.
- Well, maybe it's not about guns

1061
01:55:28,116 --> 01:55:30,774
You wanna get up there,
you're gonna need a ride.

1062
01:55:33,298 --> 01:55:35,425
I could use a boost though.

1063
01:55:37,219 --> 01:55:41,204
- You sure about this?
- Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

1064
01:56:08,047 --> 01:56:10,503
Turn, turn.

1065
01:57:27,702 --> 01:57:29,730
This way.

1066
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:35,623
Director Fury, the council has made
a decision.

1067
01:58:35,821 --> 01:58:38,747
I recognize the council has made
a decision,

1068
01:58:38,943 --> 01:58:42,003
but given that it's a stupid assed decision,
I've elected to ignore it.

1069
01:58:42,202 --> 01:58:46,785
Director, you're closer than any of our subs,
you scramble that jet

1070
01:58:46,983 --> 01:58:49,774
That is the island of Manhattan,
Councilman.

1071
01:58:49,974 --> 01:58:52,835
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

1072
01:58:52,836 --> 01:58:55,420
I will not order a nuclear strike
against a civilian population.

1073
01:58:55,620 --> 01:58:57,946
If we don't hold them in the air,
we lose everything.

1074
01:58:58,146 --> 01:59:01,134
I'd send that bird out,
we already have.

1075
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:10,670
Hawkeye.

1076
01:59:11,232 --> 01:59:15,085
- Nat, what are you doing?
- Little help.

1077
01:59:19,739 --> 01:59:21,732
I got him.

1078
01:59:47,306 --> 01:59:50,896
Enough!
You are all of you beneath me!

1079
01:59:51,096 --> 01:59:56,080
I am God,
you dull creature, and
I will not be bullied by.

1080
02:00:05,181 --> 02:00:07,173
Puny God.

1081
02:00:15,112 --> 02:00:19,629
Doctor.

1082
02:00:19,963 --> 02:00:28,300
Loki's scepter, the energy...the Tesseract
can't fight. You can't protect against yourself.

1083
02:00:28,335 --> 02:00:31,327
It's not your fault. 
You didn't know what you were doing.

1084
02:00:33,783 --> 02:00:35,909
Well, actually I think I did.

1085
02:00:36,109 --> 02:00:39,264
I built in a safety to cut
the power source.

1086
02:00:40,294 --> 02:00:44,612
- Loki's scepter.
- It may be able to close the portal.

1087
02:00:46,672 --> 02:00:48,668
And I'm looking right at it.

1088
02:01:00,657 --> 02:01:04,643
Sir, we're losing power
before penetrate that shell.

1089
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:14,642
Jarvis, you ever here of
the tale of Jonah?

1090
02:01:14,842 --> 02:01:17,500
Sir, I wouldn't think of
him as a role model.

1091
02:02:26,109 --> 02:02:30,163
Director of Fury no longer responsible.
overwrite order 7-Alfa-1-1.

1092
02:02:30,362 --> 02:02:33,351
7-Alfa 1-1-confirmed.
We are about to take off.

1093
02:02:33,817 --> 02:02:36,073
Sir we have born in motion.

1094
02:02:36,275 --> 02:02:38,266
Anyone on the deck?
We need to shut it down.

1095
02:02:38,467 --> 02:02:42,452
I repeat, take off not authorized.

1096
02:03:12,315 --> 02:03:14,275
Stark, do you hear me?

1097
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:17,031
We have a missile headed
straight to the city.

1098
02:03:17,230 --> 02:03:20,682
- How long?
- Three minutes, at best.

1099
02:03:20,884 --> 02:03:22,878
Stay load and wipe out them.

1100
02:03:23,043 --> 02:03:26,631
- Jarvis, put anything we got it.
- I just did.

1101
02:03:39,719 --> 02:03:44,904
The package is set. detonation in two
minutes and thirty seconds from now.

1102
02:04:07,224 --> 02:04:09,217
You ready for another bout?

1103
02:04:10,349 --> 02:04:12,375
What, you gettin' sleepy?

1104
02:04:16,958 --> 02:04:18,950
Right of to the front.

1105
02:04:24,664 --> 02:04:28,417
I can close it! Can anybody copy?

1106
02:04:28,653 --> 02:04:30,876
- I can shut the portal down!
- Do it!

1107
02:04:31,042 --> 02:04:33,401
- No, wait!
- Stark, these things are still coming!

1108
02:04:33,566 --> 02:04:36,623
I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna
blow in less than a minute.

1109
02:04:46,489 --> 02:04:48,913
And I know just where to put it.

1110
02:04:55,159 --> 02:04:59,012
Stark, you know that's a one way trip.
- Save the rest for the turn jarvs.

1111
02:04:59,178 --> 02:05:05,124
- Shall I tray Miss Potts?
- You might as well.

1112
02:05:07,481 --> 02:05:10,039
New York streets
has become a battleground.

1113
02:05:10,205 --> 02:05:15,521
The army is here, and try to contain
violence, but clearly

1114
02:05:21,933 --> 02:05:26,117
But the billionaire
Iron Man, Tony Stark ...

1115
02:06:37,465 --> 02:06:39,492
Come on, Stark.

1116
02:06:45,735 --> 02:06:47,728
Close it.

1117
02:07:06,998 --> 02:07:08,988
Son of a guy.

1118
02:07:12,907 --> 02:07:15,103
He's not slowing down.

1119
02:08:02,108 --> 02:08:04,098
What the hell?

1120
02:08:06,190 --> 02:08:10,343
What just happened?
Please tell me nobody kissed me?

1121
02:08:15,060 --> 02:08:17,054
We won.

1122
02:08:19,014 --> 02:08:22,366
Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job

1123
02:08:22,536 --> 02:08:26,455
guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow.

1124
02:08:26,754 --> 02:08:28,864
Let's just take a day.
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1125
02:08:28,865 --> 02:08:30,973
There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here.

1126
02:08:31,136 --> 02:08:35,126
- I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it.
- We're not finished yet

1127
02:08:39,609 --> 02:08:41,602
And then shawarma after.

1128
02:09:04,300 --> 02:09:06,493
If it's all the same to you,

1129
02:09:09,915 --> 02:09:11,941
I'll have that drink now.

1130
02:09:19,207 --> 02:09:21,149
This point of the devastation what
has been confirmed as an extra

1131
02:09:21,150 --> 02:09:22,974
terrestrial attack been a
extraordinary heroics group known as

1132
02:09:23,138 --> 02:09:28,570
The Avengers has been.....

1133
02:09:34,300 --> 02:09:36,364
I love you, Thor!

1134
02:09:47,224 --> 02:09:50,623
Super hero in New York?
Give me a break!

1135
02:09:50,786 --> 02:09:53,998
These so called heroes have
to be held responsible

1136
02:09:53,999 --> 02:09:56,517
for the destruction
done to the city.

1137
02:09:56,682 --> 02:09:58,550
This was their fight.
Where are they now?

1138
02:09:59,219 --> 02:10:02,019
Questions has been asked about,
The Avengers themselves for

1139
02:10:02,020 --> 02:10:04,679
their sudden disappearance
equally sudden disappeari.....

1140
02:10:04,819 --> 02:10:06,679
What this is all are their fault?

1141
02:10:08,276 --> 02:10:11,641
Captain America saved my life.

1142
02:10:13,572 --> 02:10:18,736
Wherever he is
and Wherever any of them are

1143
02:10:19,504 --> 02:10:22,067
I just wanna say thank you.

1144
02:10:24,265 --> 02:10:28,196
- Where the Avengers?
- I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts.

1145
02:10:28,365 --> 02:10:30,529
I'd say they'd earned a leave of absence.

1146
02:10:30,693 --> 02:10:34,958
- And the Tesseract?
- The Tesseract is where it belongs,

1147
02:10:35,476 --> 02:10:38,134
Out of our reach.

1148
02:10:38,143 --> 02:10:39,403
That's not your call.

1149
02:10:39,418 --> 02:10:40,816
I didn't make it.

1150
02:10:43,428 --> 02:10:48,533
So you let him take it and the war criminal, Loki,
who should be answering for his crime.

1151
02:10:48,706 --> 02:10:50,927
Oh, I think he will be.

1152
02:11:04,356 --> 02:11:07,213
I don't think you understand what you've started,

1153
02:11:07,417 --> 02:11:09,981
letting in The Avengers loose
on some this world.

1154
02:11:10,215 --> 02:11:13,113
- They dangerous.
- They surely are,

1155
02:11:13,281 --> 02:11:18,346
and the whole world knows it.
Every world knows it.

1156
02:11:18,508 --> 02:11:22,874
Was that the point in all this?
A statement.

1157
02:11:25,070 --> 02:11:27,072
A promise.

1158
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:37,632
How does it work now?

1159
02:11:37,964 --> 02:11:43,094
They've gone their separate ways,
some pretty extremely far.

1160
02:11:43,862 --> 02:11:47,357
We get into a situation like this again,
what happens then?

1161
02:11:47,525 --> 02:11:49,525
They'll come back.

1162
02:11:49,988 --> 02:11:53,357
- Are you really sure about that?
- I am.

1163
02:11:54,489 --> 02:11:58,882
- Why?
- Because we'll need them to.

1164
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,128
- Ma'am.
- Hi.

1165
00:35:59,307 --> 00:36:01,100
Where do you find all these people?

1166
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,213
SHIELD has not shortage of enemies,
Doctor.

1167
00:41:23,422 --> 00:41:29,411
These soldier.
