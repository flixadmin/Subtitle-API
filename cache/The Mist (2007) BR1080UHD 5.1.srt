1
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,300
Whoa!

2
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,500
All the food's gonna go bad.

3
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,400
Yeah, I drew up a list.

4
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,700
I'll hit the store
before it gets all bought out.

5
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,000
- Can you save it?
- No. No way.

6
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,699
No, I gotta start over from scratch.

7
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll call the studio
when the phones get back up,

8
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,700
see if they can extend my deadline.

9
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,600
What choice do they have?

10
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,300
You kidding?

11
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:24,100
They could whip up some bad
Photoshop poster in an afternoon.

12
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,500
They do it all the time.
Two big heads.

13
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,576
I should have brought it downstairs
with me last night.

14
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,200
Just stupid, I guess.

15
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,300
Well, sweetie,
you couldn't exactly know

16
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,376
that a tree was gonna come flying
through the window.

17
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,876
Yeah, I'll hit the hardware store too,

18
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,420
get some plastic sheeting
and duct tape

19
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,699
and seal this up
before it gets dark, you know.

20
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,300
Order in some new glass.

21
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,160
Oh, you know what?
That was your...

22
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,700
that was your grandfather's tree,
the one he planted.

23
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,500
- Ohh.
- Used to play in that tree.

24
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,800
It's just stuff, though.

25
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,300
You know, we're safe.
That's all that counts.

26
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,500
Yeah.

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,200
Mom, Dad, you gotta come see!

28
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,000
Hey, Billy, take it easy, all right?

29
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,876
I really don't want you running
all over the place.

30
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,999
But you gotta come look.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,099
The boathouse is all bashed!
Holy crap!

32
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,299
Billy.

33
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,400
Sorry, Mom, but you just
gotta come! Come on!

34
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,800
Whoa!

35
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,300
Whoa.

36
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,399
- Whoa.
- Come on.

37
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,399
Having spoken,
the Doomsayer departs.

38
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,000
Come on!

39
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,100
How do you two always manage
to make me laugh?

40
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,800
- You have incredibly low standards.
- Mm-hmm.

41
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,900
Let's go, uh, see the damage.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,100
- Norton's tree.
- Yeah.

44
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,500
You mean the dead one
I've been asking him

45
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,799
to take down for three years
before it finally blew over?

46
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
That tree?

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,100
- Really got smooshed.
- You ain't kidding'.

48
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,100
Look at that.

49
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,600
What is it, Daddy?

50
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Mist.

51
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,000
- On the lake?
- We've had mist on the lake before.

52
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,000
Coming off the mountain like that?

53
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,600
Two fronts meeting,

54
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,900
left over from the storm,
something like that.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,400
You sure?

56
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,900
Honey, I'm not the weatherman.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,200
Why don't you take Billy,
get him dressed.

58
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,600
I'll take him to town with me.

59
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay. Where you going?

60
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,200
I'm gonna go have a little chat
with our neighbor about his tree.

61
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,400
Hon.

62
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,499
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
punch him in the nose.

63
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,800
You know what he's gonna say.

64
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,999
He's gonna say, "Sue me,"
which, I don't know, maybe we should.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,500
Honey, one property dispute with
this guy is enough to last me a lifetime.

66
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,500
I'm gonna ask
for his insurance information.

67
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,300
- Okay.
- That's all.

68
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,700
Yeah.

69
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,800
Ohh!
Mother.

70
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,399
Aw!

71
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,900
Ohh, you mother.

72
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,499
"Turn on.

73
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,700
"Full choke.

74
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,000
Pull five... choke."

75
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,900
I guess you've seen the...

76
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,499
boathouse.

77
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,800
Yeah, and...?

78
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,599
Nothin'.

79
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,900
Just think we should trade
insurance info, you know?

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,100
That's all.

81
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,300
Oh, my insurance guy's
gonna <i>love</i> me.

82
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,400
Oh.

83
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
The 1980.

84
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,400
I was gonna bring
the station wagon, but...

85
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't know, the weather was so beautiful coming
out of New York, I just... you know, top down.

86
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,900
I'm sorry, man. I mean it.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,400
Sincerely.

88
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,700
- That's nice of you to say.
- No, that car was cherry.

89
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,500
I hate to see it like that.

90
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,900
Okay, I'll tell you what,

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,800
I'll find my insurance guy's number,
I'll bring it by later.

92
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,400
- That okay?
- No problem.

93
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,800
So, uh, David...

94
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,900
you're not heading into town today
by any chance, are you?

95
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,400
Well, CMP's out in force.

96
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,000
Maybe we'll get our power back.

97
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,100
I know. Some storm, huh?

98
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,500
One for the books, yeah.

99
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,299
For a moment there last night,

100
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,799
I thought we were gonna take off
and head for Oz.

101
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,900
WZON is off the air,

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,100
but Portland's still broadcasting.

103
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,100
- Daddy, look.
- Ah.

104
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,800
Guys from the base.

105
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,000
- From up the mountain?
- Uh-huh.

106
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,500
The Arrowhead Project?

107
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,099
Well, you're a local.
Any idea what they do up there?

108
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,699
Missile defense research...

109
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,500
You know, I'm sure
you've heard the stories.

110
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,699
Oh, sure.

111
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,100
The woman at the Laundromat
says that, uh,

112
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,300
they have a crashed flying saucer
up there with frozen alien bodies.

113
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,100
Right. Miss Edna. Yeah.

114
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,700
Miss Tabloid.

115
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,500
"I Had Bigfoot's Baby."

116
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,300
"Satan's Face Appears
in Oil Well Fire."

117
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,800
You know, real reliable stuff.

118
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,000
Well, they're in a hurry.

119
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,700
Maybe their power's out too.

120
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,900
Huh. Still no signal.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,200
Why don't you go ahead?
I'm gonna try Steph on a pay phone.

122
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,000
Can I go with Mr. Norton, Daddy?

123
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,800
Sure, if you promise
to hold his hand, I guess.

124
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,900
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,600
Here's a list.

126
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,000
- Sure.
- Okay?

127
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,300
Meet you guys in there.

128
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,600
Hold hands.

129
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,500
I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was your sister.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Those look <i>so</i> freaky!

131
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,100
Hmm.

132
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,700
- Sally, hey.
- Hey, Mr. Drayton.

133
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,100
You guys look jammed up.

134
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,300
Yeah, well, half the staff
didn't show, plus the power's out.

135
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,700
Oh, no. What, no backup generator?

136
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,300
Only to keep the food cold.

137
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,300
Everything else, welcome to the Dark Ages,
and bring your checkbook.

138
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,100
Hey, Thursday night,
Steph and I want a date night.

139
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,300
- Baby-sit?
- Heck, yeah. I'm there.

140
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,800
Oh, my God.

141
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,499
The storm.

142
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Everybody's stocking' up.
Been like this since we opened.

143
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,900
Crappy day, huh?

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,300
Eh, everyone's a little
pissed off this morning.

145
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,300
'Morning, Mrs. Carmody.

146
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,000
With lines like these,
I don't know how good it is,

147
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,300
but I guess we'll have to make do.

148
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,800
- Keep your head down, pal.
- I know it.

149
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,600
Hey, champ.

150
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,100
Your wife should be a doctor.

151
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,560
She could make a fortune
in Manhattan with this handwriting.

152
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,200
Yeah, it takes some getting used to.

153
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,476
Why don't you get your stuff?
I'll meet you at the checkout.

154
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Okay, done.

155
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,400
Hey, David,
thanks for helping me out today.

156
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,700
Are you and Mr. Norton
gonna be friends now, Daddy?

157
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,100
Oh, I don't know.
"Friends" might be stretching it a little.

158
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,500
I guess you're not mad
at each other anymore.

159
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,799
I guess not.

160
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,100
Hey. And that's a start, huh?

161
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,200
I'm sorry, ma'am,
the registers are down.

162
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,100
The power outage got us too.

163
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,900
Hopefully we'll have
power up pretty soon.

164
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,400
- The bus leaves in 30 minutes.
- We'll make it, okay?

165
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,800
You guys get the goodies.
I'll wait in line.

166
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,800
Yes, ma'am, those are $1.25.

167
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,000
I need some change on register five.

168
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,400
Good morning, Ms. Reppler.

169
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,900
Hello, Ms. Reppler.

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,200
Well, hello to you, Billy Drayton.
How'd you hold up in the storm?

171
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,300
We had a tree come through the picture
window last night, right in my studio.

172
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,200
And the boathouse got all smooshed.
Mr. Norton's tree fell on it.

173
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,600
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

174
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,300
Sorry to hear that.

175
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,200
How'd you guys make out?

176
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,400
Oh, we're fine.
It's the listings I'm worried about.

177
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,340
At the very least, I'll bet every one
of our "For Sale" signs fell over.

178
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,100
We had damage
at the school, wouldn't you know?

179
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,100
That's what we get for not fixing
that roof when we should've,

180
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,600
but with funds being cut every year...

181
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,800
You'd think educating children would
be more of a priority in this country,

182
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,700
but you'd be wrong.

183
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,000
Government's got better things
to spend our money on,

184
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,700
like corporate handouts
and building bombs.

185
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,000
Daddy, is there a fire?
Is Mommy all right?

186
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,700
I'm sure she's fine.
Don't worry, okay?

187
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,200
Mind what you're doing, Sally.

188
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,800
Oh, come on,
we got 10 days' leave.

189
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,999
Check our papers.

190
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,999
Look, I told you,
all leaves are cancelled.

191
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,100
I don't know why.

192
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,100
I gotta go check the pharmacy out.

193
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,600
Three men meet me
back at the Jeep in five minutes.

194
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,900
That's an order.

195
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,800
Man! Another half an hour,
and we'd have been gone.

196
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,500
Oh, my God!

197
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,299
Something in the mist!

198
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,700
Something in the mist took John Lee!

199
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,100
Dan, catch your breath.

200
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,100
Something in the mist took John Lee.

201
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,900
I could hear him screaming.

202
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,900
Shut the doors! Shut the doors!
My God!

203
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,700
Daddy, I'm scared.
Can we go home?

204
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,199
Don't go out there.

205
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,499
There's something in the mist.
It took John Lee.

206
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,000
Screw that!
I'm getting in my car.

207
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,600
Mister, no!

208
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,800
Oh.

209
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,400
Please hold me.

210
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,499
It's okay, it's okay.

211
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,600
It's a pollution cloud.
The mills down in Rumford.

212
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,800
Some kind of chemical explosion.
Has to be.

213
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,700
What is it?

214
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,400
What's going on?

215
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,800
It's death.

216
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Aah!

217
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,000
Stay down!

218
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,300
Daddy!

219
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,300
You all right? You okay?

220
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,000
That was an earthquake.

221
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,300
I tell you, the mills blew up!

222
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,900
Is everyone okay?
Is anyone hurt?

223
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,200
Everybody just stay put, okay?
Just stay inside the store.

224
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,200
I can't. I can't stay here.
I gotta get home to my kids.

225
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,300
No.
No, don't go out there.

226
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,200
It's death out there.
It's the end of days.

227
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,300
Stop it, okay? Stop it.

228
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,200
Please, everybody,
everybody just relax, okay?

229
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,299
He's right. Let's just stay cool.

230
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,776
Let's just try to figure out
what happened.

231
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,200
I'm sorry, I... I can't just stay here.
I have to get home to my kids.

232
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,100
Ma'am, no, you can't go out there.

233
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,900
Could be a poisonous gas cloud.

234
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,500
Didn't you hear that man screaming?

235
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,200
I agree. Let's stay here
until we figure it out.

236
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,700
You're not listening!

237
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,900
I can't stay here.

238
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,900
Wanda's looking after little Victor.
She's only eight.

239
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,300
Sometimes she forgets
she's supposed to be watching him.

240
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,200
I told them I'd only be gone
a few minutes.

241
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,700
She's only eight.

242
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,600
For their sakes, don't.

243
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,300
Well, isn't anybody gonna help me?

244
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,800
Shh. It's okay, pal.

245
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,500
Won't somebody here see a lady home?

246
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,700
You?

247
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,300
You?

248
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,099
- It's okay, buddy.
- You?

249
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,400
Ma'am, please,
I got my own boy to worry about.

250
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,099
I hope you all rot in hell.

251
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,400
Ma'am, please, wait until...

252
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,000
Okay,
let's start cleaning up, okay?

253
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,700
Get the spilled bottles,
broken glass, stuff like that.

254
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,500
Aisle three has medical supplies.

255
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,399
It's okay. It's okay.

256
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,100
All right, easy, champ.
Come on.

257
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Come on.

258
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,999
Come on.
All right, hey, hey, hey.

259
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,700
Can't keep crying like this, pal.

260
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,100
Come on!

261
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,199
Come on, you're gonna hurt yourself.

262
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,500
- Come on, are you all right?
- I want Mommy!

263
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,100
All right, I know you want Mommy.

264
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,700
All right, just try to breathe.

265
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,000
Just try to breathe, okay?

266
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,400
Just try to breathe, pal.
That's okay.

267
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,100
It's all right.

268
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,899
I haven't seen him suck his thumb
like this since he was two years old.

269
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,700
He's in shock.

270
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,500
I think we all are.

271
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,300
You haven't met.

272
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,899
Amanda Dunfrey.

273
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,100
She's new in town
as of this semester.

274
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,600
Teaches third grade

275
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,999
and the special ed kids,
now that Mosher's retired.

276
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
She's wonderful.
The kids love her.

277
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,100
And David's an artist.

278
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,100
He does movie posters and such.

279
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
And me...

280
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,700
Lord, I'm babbling away
like some old biddy at a tea party!

281
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,299
My nerves are jangled, I guess.

282
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,599
Boy settle down?

283
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,100
How is he?

284
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,299
Still hot.

285
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,099
Why don't I get him some aspirin.

286
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,799
- Aisle three.
- Okay.

287
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,399
Thanks.

288
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,900
How's Dan?

289
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,800
His nose stopped bleeding'.

290
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,200
He's calmer now.
Somebody gave him a Valium.

291
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,600
Can't believe the way he ran in here.
Never seen him like that.

292
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,699
I need something to cover my boy up.
Got any blankets?

293
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,900
Furniture pads. Loading dock.

294
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Gonna keep checking on people.
If you need anything, just holler.

295
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,199
You bet. Sally, you mind?

296
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,600
Oh, I'd love to. I really should
help him clean up.

297
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,000
- I'll take him.
- Okay.

298
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,200
Daddy, don't go.

299
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,300
No, I'll be gone two seconds, Big Bill.
Come on, I'm gonna get your blanket.

300
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,300
Mrs. Reppler's here,

301
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
and so is Mrs. Turman.

302
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,900
I'll be close by, okay?

303
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,600
- Okay.
- Don't worry, I'm not far. Okay?

304
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,700
Let me look at you.

305
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Hmm?

306
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,399
Wanna lie down?

307
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,500
Yeah.

308
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,800
There you go.

309
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,500
Soon as it blows away,
we can walk out of here safe and free,

310
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,000
but we have to be smart about it.

311
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,800
First thing we need to do
is keep our wits about us

312
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,200
and find out what's happened.

313
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,000
Well, how we gonna
do that, my man?

314
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,700
We've got no phone signal,
got no radio.

315
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,300
I'm sure they're working
on those problems as we speak.

316
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,500
It stands to reason
that restoring communications

317
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,720
would be their top priority.

318
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Jeez!

319
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,300
Oh,

320
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,300
Ow!

321
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,799
God it!

322
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Ow! Ow!

323
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,300
It's obvious that we're...

324
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,399
we're in some kind
of natural disaster here.

325
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,099
Ain't nothing obvious
about this from where I sit.

326
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,400
There ain't nothing
<i>natural</i> about it either.

327
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,500
That's right.

328
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,200
It's Judgment Day,
and it's come round at last.

329
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,800
There is nothing more obvious
or natural than that.

330
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,400
Ohh, now.

331
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,100
You've done that to yourself
by a life of sin and dissolution.

332
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,100
Hey, whoa! David!

333
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,500
Hey, you guys hear that?

334
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,500
The generator?
We're just gonna check it out.

335
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,500
No, no, I turned the generator off.

336
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
It... it was backing up.

337
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,600
- N-nobody else heard that sound?
- What sound?

338
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,200
I don't know, like a... weird noise,

339
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,099
back there in the dark.

340
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,600
Like something was, like,
pressing against the door.

341
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,200
Did you hear it
before the lights went out, or after?

342
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,199
No, only after.

343
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,500
After, but, look, I heard it, okay?

344
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,699
- Nobody's calling you a liar.
- That's what it sounds like.

345
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,400
No, no, no, no.
Now, don't be that away, Mr. Drayton.

346
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
You had a scare, no doubt.

347
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,000
What say we all go check it out? Here.

348
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,600
Oooopf!

349
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,799
Man.

350
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,900
It's pretty rank in here.

351
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,100
- Myron, go check it out.
- All right.

352
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,400
Go on, fire it up.

353
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,400
All right!

354
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,600
Shut it off!

355
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,400
Holy crow, don't that stink!

356
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Something's got the exhaust
vent plugged up from the outside.

357
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,900
You get it running long enough
to raise that door a little,

358
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,499
I'll go out and clear
whatever's blocking it.

359
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,700
No, no, you can't do that.

360
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,799
Why not?
It's an electric door, right?

361
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,800
Well, yeah, but it may not be wise
to send him out there.

362
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,200
Okay, I'll do it.

363
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,200
No, look, it's not about
who goes out there.

364
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,299
What, don't you think I can do it?

365
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,000
Hey! I want to go!
It was my idea.

366
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,599
Well, wait, just stop, okay?

367
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,200
- J-Jim, right?
- Mm-hmm.

368
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,800
Myron? You guys are...

369
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
you, well, you don't seem
to understand,

370
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,600
or you're trying real hard not to.

371
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,300
This is no ordinary mist, okay?

372
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,600
You open that door,
and something gets in here.

373
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,900
Like what?

374
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,000
Well, like whatever
made that noise I heard.

375
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,600
Are you guys being willfully dense?

376
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,999
Mr. Drayton, you'll pardon me,

377
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,700
but I'm not convinced
that you heard anything.

378
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,800
I mean, we're not hearing
anything now, right? Anybody?

379
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,300
See?

380
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Now, I know, I know...
you're a big shot artist

381
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,900
with connections in New York
and Hollywood and all like that,

382
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,376
but that don't make you better
than anybody else, not in my book.

383
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,799
Hey, I didn't say that.

384
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,100
Nor do I like being
talked down to or called stupid

385
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,200
by a guy who went to college,
just 'cause he's got the jitters.

386
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,400
Fellas, it doesn't even matter
about the generator.

387
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,899
The food'll keep without it.

388
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,399
Kid, I'm gonna start the motor, you raise the
door, and you yell out when you got enough room.

389
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah. Okay, good.

390
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,800
Wait.

391
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,900
This is... you guys gonna let
this kid risk his life

392
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,699
over a generator
that doesn't even matter?

393
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,176
Would you just
shut up already?

394
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Norm!

395
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,300
Listen, Mr. Drayton,
I tell you what.

396
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,800
The next time you got something to say,
you count your teeth,

397
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,200
because I'm sick to death
of your.

398
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,700
All right? Come on, Myron.

399
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,599
- This is crazy!
- Leave 'em be.

400
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
What am I, impugning
their manhood or something?

401
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,140
Listen, they've lost
their sense of proportion.

402
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,599
What's going on here?

403
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,576
Out there in the market,
they were scared and confused.

404
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,500
In here, there's a problem
they can solve,

405
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,599
so they're gonna solve it.

406
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,199
- Ready, kid?
- Let's rock.

407
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,600
Norm, come on.

408
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,700
Don't, man.

409
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,200
It's a mistake.

410
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,000
Pussy.

411
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,600
Go up!

412
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,900
So...

413
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,400
any boogeymen?

414
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,899
Pretty scary, ain't it, Norm?

415
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,000
Yeah, right.

416
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,300
Norm.

417
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,000
Norm!

418
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,400
What

419
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,000
Ahh! Get it off! Get it off!

420
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,999
Get this frigging thing off me!

421
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,900
Get it off! Help me!

422
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,600
Help me! Help me!

423
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,200
Aah! Aaahhh!

424
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,900
There's more! There's more!

425
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,900
Somebody help me.

426
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,400
Somebody help me.

427
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,200
What are you waiting' for?

428
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,000
Aaahhhh!

429
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,000
Hang on!

430
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,700
Aaahhhh!

431
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,900
Hold him still!
Hold him still!

432
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,700
Aaahhhh!

433
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,900
Oh!

434
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,600
Aah!

435
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,100
Aah!

436
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,900
Oh!

437
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,100
Oh!

438
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,000
David, it's no good!

439
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,199
Aah!

440
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,699
Start the generator.

441
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,300
Aah! Aaaggghhh!

442
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,100
Gaaahhhh!

443
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,200
Hey, I'm sorry.

444
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,500
I mean, how the... how the hell
was I supposed to know what you meant?

445
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,500
You said you <i>heard</i> something.

446
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,376
How was I supposed to know
what you meant?

447
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,676
You should've said
what you meant better.

448
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,700
I don't know, I thought maybe
it was a big bird or some...

449
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,600
You got that kid killed!

450
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,699
Did you get a good look at it? Huh?

451
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,900
Did you get a good look
at what you did?

452
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,200
- Huh?
- David!

453
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,676
Don't hit him anymore!
Doesn't solve anything!

454
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,400
You two
you got that kid killed!

455
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
And I got his ' blood on me!

456
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Okay, I'm done.

457
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Okay.

458
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,200
- What's next?
- Kill the generator.

459
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,400
That's the first thing.

460
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,600
I'm sorry.

461
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,300
Oh, God!

462
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm... I'm sorry about the kid.

463
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,200
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

464
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,000
We oughta get out of here.

465
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,700
Hey, we didn't twist his arm.

466
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,100
Yeah, he's a ' kid.
He's supposed to be stupid.

467
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,900
What's your excuse, huh?

468
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,500
Get outta here.

469
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,500
Go back in the market.
Stay by the door.

470
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,700
Don't say anything, to anybody.

471
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,300
Not yet.

472
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,900
Not yet.

473
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,200
David? Need a little light here.

474
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,800
We have to tell 'em.

475
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,800
The people in the market,
we have to stop 'em going outside.

476
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,400
They won't believe us.

477
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,700
They have to.

478
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,000
I'm not sure I believe it.
I was here.

479
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,100
W-What we saw was impossible.

480
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,100
You know that, don't you?

481
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
I mean, what...

482
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,200
what do we say?

483
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,900
How do we convince them?

484
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,900
Ollie, what the hell were
those tentacles even attached to?

485
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,900
Oh, my God!
Are... are you all right?

486
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,600
Shh! Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's not my blood. I'm fine.

487
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,000
W-What the hell happened?

488
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:10,000
I'll explain. Give me a minute, okay?
I need to deal with something first.

489
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,500
Please, I've got to...

490
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,299
I can't let Billy see me like this.
He's scared enough.

491
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,299
Just give me a minute.
Keep him distracted. Okay?

492
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,400
Okay.

493
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,900
Hey, look, I'm sorry about Norm.

494
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,400
Me too.

495
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,899
I mean, I ain't making' excuses,
I'm just saying'.

496
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,200
Look, we need to tell people.

497
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,800
No need to say how it went down
or anything like that,

498
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,600
but, uh, we're in the deep here.

499
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,200
People need to know.

500
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,800
What about the out-of-towners?

501
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,600
We got plenty of them in the store.
Where do we even start?

502
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,999
- Brent Norton?
- That windbag?

503
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,799
He's an important attorney in New York.

504
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,999
That fellow could be
on the bench one day.

505
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,500
Counts a lot with people of this town,
or... or anywhere.

506
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,276
- Yeah, that's right.
- Do it quick, David.

507
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,100
We've got to discuss how we're gonna
stop that thing getting in here.

508
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,000
W-wait. What do you mean getting in?

509
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,200
You shut the loading door.

510
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,700
Yeah, but the entire front of the store
is plate glass.

511
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,999
I was wondering
where you'd gotten to.

512
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,500
Um, listen...

513
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,400
that guy that came in here,
the one with the bloody nose...

514
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,400
they're... they're...
We saw <i>tentacles.</i>

515
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,800
- Ain't going' very well, is it?
- Unh-unh.

516
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,000
- You... what?
- Come here, you've got...

517
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,400
Come here.

518
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,500
Tell him.

519
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
It's true.

520
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,800
Tentacles. Yeah.

521
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,500
Um, gentlemen, um...

522
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,299
I'm sorry, I...
I'm just not that stupid.

523
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,600
I mean, what do you take me for?
I'm shocked.

524
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
I'm shocked.

525
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,800
I'm shocked. It's pretty tasteless using what's
happening here to try to make me look like an idiot.

526
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,599
No, no, that's not
what's going on here.

527
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
Look, come back
to the loading dock, okay?

528
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,700
I'll show you.

529
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,300
Blood. A chunk of tentacle
on... on the floor.

530
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,400
No.

531
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,200
No? What do you mean no?

532
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,600
No. We've got real problems
to deal with here,

533
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:46,700
and this pathetic attempt at a joke
has gone far enough.

534
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,700
Mr. Norton, what reason
could we possibly have...?

535
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,499
Oh, please! Please!

536
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,076
This is payback for the lawsuit
that I filed against him last year,

537
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,900
and you guys are backing him up.

538
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,600
So winning wasn't enough, huh?

539
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,900
You wanted to humiliate me some more,

540
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,300
show me a rubber snake
while these... these hicks

541
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,776
stand around laughing their off.

542
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,700
- Watch who you calling' a hick!
- Myron! Myron!

543
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,500
- Hey, hey...!
- Mr. Norton, I swear,

544
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,700
you have got us all wrong.

545
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,300
You're not too crazy about,
um, out-of-towners, are you?

546
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,300
I only spend my money,
and I pay my taxes here,

547
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,300
and I have seen <i>you</i>
talking behind my back.

548
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,300
Y'all stick together.

549
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,100
Well, don't I feel foolish?

550
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,699
I actually thought you were
being kind to me today,

551
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,276
and, well, thanks
for setting me straight.

552
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,499
And I'm glad that tree fell
on your boathouse, you know that?

553
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,999
Glad. Smashed it in
pretty good, didn't it? Fantastic.

554
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,676
Now, all of y'all,
just stay out of my way.

555
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,299
I know you're scared, man.
I'm scared too.

556
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,400
- Lives are at stake around here.
- David...

557
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,800
Okay, my <i>son 's</i> life.
Now, I need <i>you.</i>

558
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,400
Brent, please, get your
head out of your.

559
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,700
All right, I'll drag you back there
if I have to. Come here.

560
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,700
David, get... get your
hands off of me!

561
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,700
I'll sue your again!

562
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,100
Sue your and this time
you'll go to jail!

563
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,699
This man assaulted me.

564
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,300
He assaulted me.
You were witness to it.

565
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,476
This man's crazy.
He's crazy.

566
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,100
No.

567
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,600
He isn't. I wish he was, but he isn't.

568
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,900
E-everyone in the store,
you want to come back here?

569
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,600
There's something you need to hear.
It concerns you all.

570
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,999
Okay.

571
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
W-w-wait. I don't know
what you people think you're doing.

572
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,600
You're drinking?

573
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,200
For's sake, Ollie.

574
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,299
Do you want me to report you?
You want to lose your job?

575
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,376
Look, I'm gonna be taking down names,
starting with you.

576
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,300
And I am prepared to file
a police report.

577
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,399
- Fine, Bud, write down your names.
- I will.

578
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,300
But in the meantime,
shut up and listen.

579
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,300
This is Mr. David Drayton.

580
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,700
You need to hear what he's got to say
if you're thinking about leaving.

581
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,440
Go hang out
with the ladies, all right?

582
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,800
Listen, don't be scared.

583
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It's okay.

584
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Okay.

585
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,700
This is how it is.

586
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,200
Now, I don't know
what this mist is...

587
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,476
but there are things in it,
and they're dangerous, like Dan said.

588
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,500
That's right.

589
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,900
That's exactly right.

590
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,900
What kind of things?

591
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,900
I never saw it.
It happened too fast.

592
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,800
I got knocked down.

593
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,099
Five of us went back
in the loading dock.

594
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,700
It was Jim, Myron, Ollie...

595
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,400
me...

596
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,000
Norm, the bag-boy.

597
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,620
- We opened the door...
- Where's Norm?

598
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,400
So Norm could go out
and clear the vent for the generator.

599
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,700
Something come out of the mist
and took him.

600
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,100
- Took him?
- What do you mean?

601
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,800
Just... killed him.

602
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,700
I mean dragged him off.

603
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,400
Now, guys, I don't know
what these things are.

604
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,900
All we saw were tentacles.

605
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
<i>Tentacles?</i>

606
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,600
Tentacles, he says.

607
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,300
Tentacles from Planet X.

608
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,700
It's a lie, you know.

609
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,900
I mean, all these people do
is just lie each other up.

610
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,200
It's a pile of.

611
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,500
Of course it's a lie.
Of course it's a lie. It's lunacy.

612
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,400
From the look of it, the tentacles
are coming out of the beer cans.

613
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,300
All right, uh, Bud,
don't take our word for it. Go look.

614
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Over there.

615
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,200
What the hell is that?

616
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,000
It appears we may have a problem
of some magnitude here.

617
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,800
Yeah, just keep 'em in line. Thanks.

618
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,300
Let me...

619
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,900
help these people.

620
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,700
Let me...

621
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
let me preach Your word.

622
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,299
Let me shine Your light,

623
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,800
'cause they're not <i>all</i> bad.

624
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,200
They can't <i>all</i> be bad.

625
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,100
Some can be saved, can't they?

626
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,900
Yes.

627
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,600
Some <i>can</i> be brought...

628
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,800
to heaven's holy gates
through Your grace.

629
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,100
I have to believe that,

630
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,600
though I know most will swim
in the lake of fire forever.

631
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,900
If I can save a few...

632
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,200
even one...

633
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,700
then my life will have counted
for something.

634
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,500
I will have pulled my weight.

635
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,000
I will have earned my place at Your side.

636
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,300
I will have served a purpose
here on this earth.

637
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
Hello?

638
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,399
What?

639
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,699
I just need to use the bathroom.

640
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,800
Oh.

641
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,300
Okay. Well, then, have at it.

642
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,900
Ma'am...

643
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,800
I... I just want you to know
that it's okay...

644
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,500
being scared, I mean...

645
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,100
and, well, if you need a friend...

646
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,600
you know, someone to talk to.

647
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,700
I have a friend...

648
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,700
God up above.
I talk to Him every day.

649
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
Don't you condescend to me.

650
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,000
I'm sorry?

651
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,600
Not ever.
You don't mock me.

652
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,300
That's not what I was doing.

653
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,300
Well, I'll tell you what...

654
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,399
the day I need a friend like you,

655
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,400
I'll just have myself a little squat
and one out.

656
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,800
Maybe you <i>do</i> believe this.

657
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,000
Maybe they're not lies,
they're delusions. Whatever.

658
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,300
Uh, the fact remains,
the evidence here is flimsy.

659
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,100
- It's bordering on ludicrous.
- Hey, this isn't a courtroom.

660
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,099
You're not arguing a case, and you're doing
nothing but damage, talking the way you are.

661
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,200
And you can throw as much cow's blood
around the loading dock as you want to.

662
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,620
- You still haven't fooled anyone.
- Leave it alone, David.

663
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,500
You can't convince
some people there's a fire

664
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,599
even when their hair is burning.

665
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,100
Denial is a powerful thing.

666
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,300
Well, keep talking.

667
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,600
I'll have no part of it,
nor would any thinking person.

668
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,399
Keep thinking, Mr. Lawyer.

669
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,400
There's no defense
against the will of God.

670
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,700
There's no court of appeals in hell.

671
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,100
There's no defense here, either.

672
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,000
Not even with all the fertilizer in the world,
not even if you stack it as high as you can.

673
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,400
It's still just bags of isn't it?

674
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,800
Those of you who want to discuss
this thing rationally

675
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,799
to find a means of rescue
are welcome to join me.

676
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,599
Those who want to stack dog food...

677
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,300
knock yourselves out.

678
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,200
We got those windows taped up
as best we could.

679
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,400
It should help.

680
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,900
Yeah, think so?

681
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,700
Duct tape and dog food bags.

682
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,300
That bad?

683
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,400
It's not good.

684
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,600
There's none so blind
as those who will not see.

685
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,400
Open your eyes.

686
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,799
Let the scales fall away.

687
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,800
This has all been written.

688
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,700
Revelations, chapter 15:

689
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,100
"And the temple was filled with smoke

690
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,300
"from the glory of God

691
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,799
"and from His power,

692
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,800
"and no one could enter the temple

693
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,400
until the seven plagues
of the seven angels were completed."

694
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,800
Well, what are you saying?

695
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,200
What are you proposing?

696
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,900
That we all prepare...

697
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,800
to meet our Maker.

698
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,000
Oh, prepare to meet.

699
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,600
Lady, your tongue
must be hung in the middle

700
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,500
so that it can waggle at both ends.

701
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,400
The end time has come,

702
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,199
not in flames, but in mist.

703
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,300
Come here!

704
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,500
Easy! Back off!

705
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,999
How about if your prepares
to meet my size-10 work boot.

706
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,500
- How about that?
- Hey, there's no call for that.

707
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,800
Myron, please,
calm your friend down.

708
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,700
I'm trying
to save your soul, you stupid man.

709
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,000
- Doubters will doubt till the end.
- It's okay.

710
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,100
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

711
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,800
A monstrosity <i>did</i> pull
that poor boy away.

712
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,700
Things in the mist...
do you doubt?

713
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,900
Do you?

714
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,300
Then go out.

715
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,700
Go out and say,
"How do you do."

716
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,900
Shut up, lady.

717
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,700
For God's sakes.

718
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,999
Look, you'll have to stop now.
You're scaring the children.

719
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,499
They should be scared.

720
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,200
Oh, yes, they should.

721
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,700
Their beautiful, pure little minds

722
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,200
have been corrupted with lies.

723
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,300
Lies.

724
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,500
All this talk of a modern God,

725
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,300
or no God.

726
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,099
There is one God.

727
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,799
The God of the Israelites.

728
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,700
And He is a stern and vengeful God,

729
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,300
and we have been mocking Him
far too long,

730
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,000
and now He demands
retribution in blood.

731
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,800
It is time to declare yourselves.

732
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,500
Take sides...

733
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,400
the saved and the damned.

734
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,000
Read the Good Book.
It calls for expiation.

735
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,900
- Blood!
- What?

736
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,100
Blood.

737
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,800
Little Normie was first,

738
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,999
and now God calls the rest of us.

739
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,500
The bill is due.

740
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,100
It must be paid.

741
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,200
As Abraham prepared
to sacrifice his only son

742
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,100
to prove his love for God, so...

743
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,600
Enough.

744
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,700
- Ohh.
- Another down payment.

745
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,700
A few more pennies in the jar.

746
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,320
Now, that's nice, see.
I can't smack her, but it's okay for you.

747
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,600
I-I'm sorry everybody,

748
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,700
but this lady's perspective is
a little too Old Testament for my taste.

749
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,300
They'll come for you.

750
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,800
Maybe tonight,
when darkness comes.

751
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,200
They'll come tonight,
and they'll take someone else.

752
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,300
See if they don't.

753
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,199
And when they do,

754
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,800
you will cry to God,

755
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,600
and you will beg Mother Carmody
to show you the way.

756
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,000
That's fine.

757
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,300
But until then,
if you don't shut up,

758
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,400
I'll wrap this tape around your mouth.

759
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,799
You just try it, Ollie Weeks.

760
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,300
And you...

761
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,400
you hit me again...

762
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,400
if you dare.

763
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,200
You'll be on your knees to me
before this is through.

764
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,600
Those of you who aren't local should know that
Mrs. Carmody is known in town for being...

765
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,900
unstable.

766
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,200
No
What was your first clue?

767
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,700
Shh.

768
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,700
- Hi.
- What's up, little dude?

769
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,600
How come your friends
don't come get us?

770
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,300
They got tanks and stuff, right?

771
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,100
Why can't you just call 'em?

772
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,300
Phones don't work.

773
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,200
But don't you got, like, a radio?

774
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,700
Hey, champ, what's going on?

775
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,000
I want their friends
to come rescue us.

776
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,276
They would if they could, pal.
They're stuck here just like us.

777
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,100
- But...
- Shh.

778
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,900
Now, guys, we could use
a hand over there.

779
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,100
Yeah, sure thing.

780
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,899
Troop, off your.

781
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,700
- You all right?
- I don't like that scary lady.

782
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,100
Oh, man, I don't either.

783
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,700
But you know what?

784
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,500
Maybe she's scared too.

785
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,500
You think?

786
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,000
You think Mommy's okay?

787
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,300
Billy...

788
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,300
I'm sorry about the times
I was bad to her.

789
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,500
Aw, hey.

790
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,600
Mommy loves you very much.

791
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,200
And I'll bet she's fine.

792
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And I promise you,

793
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,300
I'm gonna do everything I can
to get us back to her.

794
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,300
- Okay?
- 'Kay.

795
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,700
- Yeah?
- 'Kay.

796
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,800
So, we can use the charcoal fluid
and the mops to make torches.

797
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,900
And we've got knives and stuff, God knows.

798
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,200
This may be a silly question, Bud, but...
do you happen to have a <i>gun</i> in the store?

799
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,000
Here? No. Please.

800
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,900
This... this isn't Los Angeles.

801
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,600
I've got a shotgun in my truck.

802
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,400
I could try for it if you want.

803
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,799
Oh, God, I don't think that'd be
a good idea, Mr. Cornell.

804
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,900
Hold on.

805
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,800
This gun, um...

806
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,700
my husband's idea.

807
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,800
He's away on business a lot.

808
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,099
It's not even loaded.

809
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,800
Ain't much use unloaded, ma'am.

810
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,900
Um...

811
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,000
You know how to use that?

812
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,899
Well, I shot it once on a pistol range.
Hit the target a few times.

813
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,700
So, we got a gun.

814
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,700
Anybody know how to shoot it?

815
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,200
<i>Well,</i> I mean?

816
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,300
I do.

817
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,100
You?

818
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,000
Ollie. Please.

819
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,200
Some target shooting.

820
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,500
State champion in '94.

821
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,200
- You're crazy if you go out there!
- Let us pass! Let us pass, please!

822
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,576
Let's just talk this thing through.

823
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,800
We have, and we've
made our decision. We're leaving.

824
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,800
Hey, Mr. Mackey's gonna barbecue
some chicken on the gas grill.

825
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,276
- Why don't we just sit down and just...
- What, and let you keep on talking?

826
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,476
No, I've been in far too many
courtrooms to fall for that.

827
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,576
You've already psyched out
half a dozen of my people already.

828
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,699
<i>Your</i> people?

829
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,576
What kind of talk is that?
They're people, that's all.

830
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,100
Now... now listen, everyone.

831
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,100
We are experiencing
some kind of disaster.

832
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,199
I don't know whether
it's manmade or natural,

833
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,100
but I do know that
it's definitely not supernatural

834
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,500
or biblical,
and, no offense, Mrs. Carmody,

835
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,299
but the only way
we're gonna help ourselves

836
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,000
is to seek rescue.

837
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,800
We're going out.

838
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,599
- Brent, look.
- I'm not discussing this any further.

839
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,800
I know. I just want to ask a favor.

840
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,099
Tie this around your waist.

841
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,200
What for?

842
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,400
It'll let us know you got
at least 300 feet.

843
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,700
I'll do it.

844
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,800
- Are you throwing in with them?
- Me? No thanks.

845
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,500
I think your man there
is a little too tightly wound.

846
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,700
Gonna get somebody killed.

847
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,600
But I'm thinking' we could use
that shotgun of yours.

848
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,300
I saw where you parked
when I pulled in.

849
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,500
Red pickup, right?
Far entrance?

850
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,400
Son, you got brass balls.

851
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,400
The shells are
in the glove compartment.

852
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,700
Drive it back.

853
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,100
All right.

854
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,900
Just see they're paying out this line.

855
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,200
Line's up, I'll cut her loose,

856
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,600
just so you understand.

857
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,800
Yeah.

858
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,700
You sure there's no way
I can talk you out of this?

859
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,100
David... there's nothing out there.
Nothing in the mist.

860
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,100
What if you're wrong?

861
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,700
Then, I guess...

862
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,800
the joke would be on me after all.

863
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,300
We're gonna send back help.

864
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,800
You'll die out there.
All of you.

865
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,700
Hey, crazy lady,
I believe in God too.

866
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,800
I just don't think He's the bloodthirsty
you make Him out to be.

867
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,500
Well, you take that up with the devil
when you run into him.

868
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,200
You just chat it over at your leisure.

869
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,820
Well, let's strike out
toward the center of town.

870
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,300
Keep it loose.

871
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,600
Nice and easy.

872
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,900
Keep going.

873
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,600
Look.

874
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,000
It's going.

875
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,200
They're doing good.

876
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,900
Aah! Aaahhhh!

877
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,600
Put it down!

878
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,900
Ohh! Pull!

879
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,200
Oh, my God!
I'm slipping'!

880
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,000
Pull! Back up! Back up!
Back up!

881
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,500
Get it off!

882
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,900
Oh, my God.

883
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,000
- Aw, sh...
- Blood!

884
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,800
Awww, sh...!

885
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,600
Oh, my God!

886
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,100
Oh, my God!

887
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,900
Cut the rope!

888
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:18,700
Shut the door!

889
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,300
Now do you see?

890
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,800
Now do you believe?

891
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,200
About a half-hour of daylight left.

892
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,399
Guys, how's it going
with these work lights?

893
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,000
- We're getting' 'em rigged up all right.
- Yeah, check it out.

894
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,000
All right, all right.
Save it, save it.

895
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,500
These batteries ain't topped up.

896
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,700
You turn the lights on,
it's gonna drain 'em quick.

897
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,900
How quick?

898
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,999
- Five minutes, maybe ten.
- Yeah, if that.

899
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Okay, emergencies only.

900
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,500
If something gets in the store.

901
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,800
Holy
you scared the outta me.

902
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,500
Oh, Sally, I'm sorry, really.

903
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,800
I thought I'd come in and say hi
and see how you were holding up.

904
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

905
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,800
Barely. How about you?

906
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,500
I'm worried about my folks, I guess.

907
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,200
You know, they live
up on Shorm Road.

908
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,400
That's less than
five miles from here.

909
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,000
How 'bout yours?

910
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,700
Well, they're out of town right now.

911
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,300
They're at my aunt's in Boston, so...

912
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,100
That's lucky.
That means they're okay.

913
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,500
I hope so.

914
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,300
So... how soon you shipping out?

915
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,000
Uh, couple weeks.

916
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,200
Scared about going over there?

917
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,600
Yeah.

918
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,400
- Hey, Wayne?
- Hmm?

919
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,600
How come you never asked me out?

920
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:06,600
We flirted all through high school.
I know you like me.

921
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,400
So how come?

922
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,700
I'm stupid, I guess.

923
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,400
Oh! I'm sorry.

924
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:39,799
Don't be. I just... I just didn't really
want it to happen like this, you know?

925
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,500
Some locker room at work.

926
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,800
Can we just stay in here a while, then?

927
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,600
I mean, just... just you and me.

928
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:03,500
- The parking lot lamps turned on.
- They're on a timer.

929
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,600
Must be a different municipal line.

930
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,400
Maybe we could
tie into them somehow,

931
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,300
get some electricity in here.

932
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,000
That'd mean walking out the door.

933
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,800
Gaaaahhhh! God!

934
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,099
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

935
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,100
David! David!

936
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,500
You sure?

937
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,600
Look!

938
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,200
My God.

939
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,200
Are those bugs?

940
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,500
Not like any I've ever seen.

941
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,700
"They came out of the smoke,

942
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,700
"locusts upon the earth,

943
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,300
"and unto them was given power

944
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,600
even as the scorpions
of the earth have power."

945
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,200
Wow.

946
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:36,700
Look at those stingers.

947
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,200
Dear God.

948
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,200
Myron, get the ones in the back!

949
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,560
God, I think they're
attracted to the light.

950
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,900
Look out, look out, look out!

951
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,080
The light! Douse the light!

952
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,100
Look out! Look out!

953
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,100
Move! Move!

954
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,600
Light, light,
light, light, light!

955
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,600
"And there came a voice
from the temple

956
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,500
"saying to the seven angels,

957
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,900
"'Go your ways

958
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,100
and pour out the vials
of the wrath of God upon the earth.'"

959
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,500
Ollie, the glass is gonna give!

960
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,999
Oh, my God, they turned on all the lights!

961
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,500
- Jim! Myron!
- Fire!

962
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,500
- Douse the lights!
- Fire! Lighter!

963
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,800
Come on, come on!

964
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,900
Aah!

965
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Whoa!

966
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,600
Aah!

967
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,800
Oh, ugh!

968
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,800
Sally, look out!

969
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,200
No!

970
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,600
Ohh! Oohhhh!

971
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,600
Let me see, let me see.
Let me see, sweetheart, let me see.

972
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,699
No, you're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

973
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:09,800
Let me see. Let me see.

974
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,576
You're fine. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

975
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,876
Give me the lighter!
Put it on fire!

976
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,000
Come on!

977
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,400
Come on, come on!
Breathe, breathe, breathe, Sally!

978
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:23,100
Childproofing sons of

979
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,100
Aaahhhh!

980
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,400
Oh, shoot it! Shoot it!

981
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,799
Shoot it! Shoot it!

982
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,400
I can't! I'll smash the window!

983
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,700
God!

984
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,400
Oh, God! Ohh!

985
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,600
- Aaahhh!
- Go! Go!

986
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,900
Get down!

987
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,640
- Ollie, you want these lights on or off?
- Leave 'em on.

988
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,600
Aah! Aaahhhh!

989
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:10,700
Oh, God!

990
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,100
Ohh! Ohhh! Kill it!

991
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,800
Aaaaahhhhhh!

992
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,140
Bring torches!
Bring something to keep 'em out!

993
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,300
Come on.

994
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,400
Sally!

995
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,500
Where are the extinguishers?

996
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,400
What's happening?!

997
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,600
Get it! Get it! Get it!

998
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,900
Bring torches.
We need torches at the window!

999
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,600
Plug that hole!

1000
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,800
Dad!

1001
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,400
Down! Down! Lay down!

1002
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,600
Ohh.

1003
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,000
My life...

1004
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:42,500
my life for You,
Your will be done.

1005
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,999
Daddy!

1006
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,300
Bugs! Daddy!

1007
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,000
- Nooooo! Billy!
- Daddy!

1008
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:20,100
- Billy!
- Daddy!

1009
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,600
Billy! Oh!

1010
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:35,800
Dad!

1011
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,400
Billy, come back here.

1012
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:41,100
- Dad!
- Billy, please!

1013
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,300
Billy!

1014
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,500
Come on, let's move it!

1015
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,600
Somebody please
come over here and help.

1016
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,300
Here's some tape!

1017
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,800
I'm right here.
I'm right here. Don't worry.

1018
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,799
Hurry up with the blankets!

1019
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,800
It hurts so bad! Please!

1020
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,200
It hurts so bad!

1021
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,200
Block it up here.

1022
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,400
Get me some more bags!

1023
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,000
Did we get 'em?
Did we get 'em all?

1024
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,700
She was right.

1025
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,100
She said that it would happen like this.

1026
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,200
She said that
they would come at night.

1027
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,200
She told us someone would die.

1028
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,900
Mommy.

1029
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,500
Ohh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

1030
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,300
It's okay, it was just a dream.

1031
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,600
It's just a bad dream.

1032
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,400
I want my mommy.

1033
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,100
I know.

1034
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,400
I know. Of course you do.

1035
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,100
- Shh.
- I wanna go home.

1036
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,700
Just sleep.

1037
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,700
Everything'll be better in the morning.

1038
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,900
Think he likes you.

1039
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,000
Well, I hate that
I had to lie to him.

1040
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,500
You have kids?

1041
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,800
No.

1042
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,100
I always wanted to, but...

1043
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,800
things haven't been working out.

1044
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:16,100
Right now I'm thinking
maybe that's for the best.

1045
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:21,100
I saw creatures
fly into the store tonight that...

1046
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,900
they shouldn't exist.

1047
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,900
I keep thinking I'm gonna
wake up in a rubber room.

1048
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,600
You're not alone in that.

1049
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,100
We're all right there with you.

1050
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,000
This isn't gonna end, is it?

1051
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
David.

1052
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,300
It's Joe. He's getting worse.

1053
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,200
Joe.

1054
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,800
How you holding' up, partner?

1055
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:09,200
David... is that you?

1056
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:11,800
Yeah, pal, how you doing'?

1057
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,600
It's bad. He's bad.

1058
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,300
Didn't know anything
could hurt like this.

1059
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,600
If you guys can't help me...

1060
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,100
you... you gotta end it, okay?

1061
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,700
Ollie's got that gun, right?

1062
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,700
- Right?
- No. No way.

1063
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,100
You can't with me on this, bro.

1064
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,399
Not with me like this.

1065
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,900
I'll do it.

1066
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,700
Just give me the gun.

1067
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,400
Hey, hey. Shh.

1068
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:47,600
- We're not there yet, okay?
- Oh, please!

1069
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:49,400
Joe, now, listen.

1070
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,699
Pal... we're gonna work something out.

1071
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:56,600
I just need you to hang in
a little longer, okay? Can we do that?

1072
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,200
Stay with him.
I'll be back.

1073
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:09,500
Hattie, I need to go to the bathroom.
Will you watch Billy?

1074
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,500
Hattie.

1075
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,400
See anything?

1076
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,500
The last of those bugs
went away about four.

1077
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,700
Dawn's coming.
What's on your mind?

1078
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,100
It's Joe.

1079
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,900
We don't get him on some serious
antibiotics, he's gonna die of infection.

1080
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,300
Plus he needs
painkillers in the worst way.

1081
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:50,200
All... all... all we got here
is liquor and aspirin.

1082
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:53,000
You... you thinking' about going'
to that pharmacy next door?

1083
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,000
Irene Reppler says
they've got Silvadene...

1084
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,900
you know, the stuff
they use in burn wards.

1085
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,100
- She knows where they keep it.
- Slow down.

1086
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,899
You can't actually
be thinking' of doing' this.

1087
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,899
I'm also thinking' beyond that.

1088
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:04,600
We have to get out of here.

1089
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:09,100
- I mean <i>permanently.</i>
- Why? We got plenty to eat!

1090
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,199
And what happens when one of those things
decides to break through this window?

1091
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,000
I'm talking' one of the big ones,
like the one that killed Norm.

1092
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:18,000
Yeah, and that flaming torch idea
didn't work so well, did it?

1093
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:20,100
We almost burned
the store down.

1094
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,700
It's Hattie.

1095
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,599
Here?

1096
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,600
All right,
gently, now. Gently.

1097
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:40,000
One... two... three.

1098
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,800
I don't know
how long she was there like that,

1099
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,200
lying there next to us.

1100
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,000
I thought she was sleeping.

1101
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,199
I got my four-wheel drive.

1102
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,800
It's out there.

1103
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:01,600
Y-you're talking about leaving?

1104
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,400
Well, we...

1105
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,300
should hit the pharmacy first.

1106
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,976
We gotta bring back
supplies for the injured.

1107
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,299
I mean, if we don't,

1108
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:12,100
Joe Eagleton's gonna die,
and we can't let that happen.

1109
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,300
But after that...

1110
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,020
look, my Land Cruiser
can hold eight people.

1111
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:18,300
I say we drive south
as far as the fuel takes us

1112
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,600
and try to get clear of this mist.

1113
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,700
That's it?

1114
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,100
That's the plan?

1115
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,100
- That's what I got.
- No, you can't mean it.

1116
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,200
Not after what happened
to Norton and his group.

1117
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:30,700
No, no, no. Amanda, <i>think.</i>

1118
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,700
Norton got over 200 feet
from this store.

1119
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,300
That's how much rope played out.

1120
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,900
I'm parked half that distance from here.

1121
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,999
But who knows how far
this mist has spread?

1122
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,576
It could be the entire eastern seaboard.

1123
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,800
Yeah, it could be the whole world,
for all we know.

1124
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,100
Wouldn't make us any less dead,
now, would it?

1125
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,100
We have one gun.

1126
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,100
- How many rounds?
- We got ten left.

1127
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,300
Ten rounds.

1128
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,100
Okay, so ten.

1129
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:56,099
Want another reason
to get the hell out of here?

1130
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:59,100
I'll give you the best one. Her.

1131
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,700
Mrs. Carmody.

1132
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,600
She's our very own Jim Jones.

1133
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:07,400
I'd like to leave before people
start drinking the Kool-Aid.

1134
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:08,500
He's right.

1135
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,899
Flakier people get,
the better she's gonna look.

1136
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:13,600
No, I don't buy that.
It's obvious she's nuts.

1137
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:15,199
Look, a few people maybe, but...

1138
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,500
No, I count four.
She's preaching' to 'em right now.

1139
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,100
By noon, she'll have four more.

1140
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,300
By tomorrow night,
when those things come back,

1141
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,900
she'll have a congregation,

1142
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,500
and then we can start worrying'
about who she's gonna sacrifice

1143
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,200
to make it all better.

1144
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,999
Hmm?

1145
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,999
You, Amanda?

1146
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,300
My little boy?

1147
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,000
He's right.

1148
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,200
You don't have much faith
in humanity, do you?

1149
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,600
None whatsoever.

1150
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:41,200
I can't accept that.

1151
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:44,000
People are basically good, decent.

1152
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,100
My God, David, we're a civilized society.

1153
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,200
Sure, as long as the machines
are working' and you can dial 9-1-1,

1154
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:52,100
but you take those things away,
you throw people in the dark,

1155
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,199
you scare the out of them,

1156
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,100
no more <i>rules,</i>

1157
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,100
you'll see how primitive they get.

1158
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:03,499
You scare people badly enough,
you can get 'em to do anything.

1159
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:07,100
They'll turn to whoever
promises a solution,

1160
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,400
or <i>whatever.</i>

1161
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,500
Ollie, please, back me up here.

1162
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,300
I wish I could.

1163
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,700
As a species,
we're fundamentally insane.

1164
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:20,400
Put more than two of us in a room, we pick sides
and start dreaming up reasons to kill one another.

1165
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:24,099
Why do you think we invented
politics and religion?

1166
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:27,899
Oh, that's just... wrong.

1167
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,400
Look, nobody has
to decide anything now, okay?

1168
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,700
First things first... the pharmacy.

1169
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,899
That'll be our test run.

1170
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:38,000
Okay?

1171
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,999
It's all right, Big Bill.

1172
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,700
I'm gonna bring you back
some comic books.

1173
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,100
I don't want them.

1174
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,800
I want you to stay here.

1175
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,900
I won't be gone long.

1176
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Just... just next door.

1177
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,900
Hey, you'll be safe.

1178
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:04,500
Daddy...

1179
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,100
Daddy, there are things out there.

1180
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,900
Things...

1181
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,900
Yeah. There's a lot
less of 'em in the daytime.

1182
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:16,400
They'll wait. They'll wait in the mist
where you can't see 'em,

1183
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,800
and then when you go
and can't get back in...

1184
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,300
they'll come and eat you up!

1185
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,700
- Shh.
- Daddy, don't go!

1186
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,300
I'll be back.

1187
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,100
Big Bill... I promise.

1188
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,500
I'll be back, and then
I'm gonna take you home.

1189
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,100
All right?

1190
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,300
Together, we're going home.

1191
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:48,599
If something happens,
anything at all, you cut and run.

1192
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,300
You get your back in here,
for your boy's sake.

1193
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,900
If something happens to me,
I want you to take care of Billy...

1194
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:57,900
best as you can,
as long as you can.

1195
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,700
Land Cruiser's yours now.

1196
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,399
You... you get him out of here.

1197
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,800
You just keep driving'.

1198
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,400
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. David Drayton?

1199
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:15,499
Are you so anxious
to make your boy an orphan?

1200
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,600
My boy is no concern of yours.

1201
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:18,999
Listen up.

1202
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
We're going to the pharmacy.

1203
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,099
We're gonna bring back some supplies.

1204
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:26,500
Also, there may be people
trapped over there who need help.

1205
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,799
Listen, folks, listen!

1206
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,800
We're not gonna take any chances.

1207
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,399
If there's any trouble,

1208
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,400
we'll come straight back here
to the supermarket.

1209
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:37,899
And bring the fiends of hell
down on our heads, thank you.

1210
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,400
She's right.

1211
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:42,500
You'll make 'em notice us.
You'll make 'em come.

1212
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,200
Why can't you just leave
well enough alone?

1213
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:48,100
Lady, this what you call
"well enough"?

1214
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,700
You wanna stop us?

1215
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,300
You better explain to Bobby here

1216
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,676
why we're not bringing' painkillers
and medicine back for his brother.

1217
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:55,800
I'm going', even if I have to go alone.

1218
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:57,600
You'll die out there, young man.

1219
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:00,799
You'll walk out that door
and be torn to shreds,

1220
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,099
and then your hell-bound pride
will have them come get the rest of us.

1221
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,900
Yes, they'll come back for all of us,
just like this good lady said.

1222
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Do you want that
to happen, people?

1223
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:12,300
- No!
- No! No! No!

1224
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,399
Well, it is this kind of hubris

1225
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,900
that brought the wrath of God
in the first place.

1226
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,600
This kind of pride and defiance of...

1227
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,100
Shut up, you miserable buzzard!

1228
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,400
You old.

1229
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,900
No, no, no, no!

1230
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,700
Stoning people who piss you off
is perfectly okay.

1231
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,400
They do it in the Bible, don't they?

1232
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,300
And I got lots of peas.

1233
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,000
David, please, if you want to go,
now's the time.

1234
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,799
How 'bout it, Army?

1235
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,300
Any help from the armed forces?

1236
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,500
I'll go.

1237
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,900
Jim Grondin.
I had you in school, didn't I?

1238
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Yes'm, me and my sister Pauline.

1239
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,700
Pair of underachievers.

1240
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,000
After you, Jim.

1241
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,400
Yes, ma'am.

1242
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:55,899
Oh,

1243
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:58,300
That it?
That's everybody?

1244
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,900
Everybody that's going'.

1245
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
- Yep.
- Okay.

1246
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:05,100
Single file,
one by one, all right?

1247
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,900
Let's get this thing over with.

1248
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,200
Let's go.

1249
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,000
- After you.
- Yes.

1250
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Stay together.

1251
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,000
- Get the door.
- You know what?

1252
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:21,676
- Mrs. Carmody, you're not helping.
- I don't care.

1253
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:23,400
- Shut the hell up!
- You shut up!

1254
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,500
Save the batteries.

1255
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,600
They left the doors propped open.

1256
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,500
Think something got in?

1257
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,500
Let's just... get what we need,
get the hell outta here.

1258
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,000
Yeah. Let's do that.

1259
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:37,500
The meds are
over at the end there, in the cubicle.

1260
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,400
- Will you not do that?
- I'm sorry. I'm <i>sorry.</i>

1261
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,500
Oh, god.

1262
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,499
Where's that Silvadene?

1263
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:31,000
It's over behind David.

1264
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,000
In the fridge. Check there.

1265
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:40,600
Silvadene. Got it.

1266
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,100
- Good.
- Ollie, what are we looking' for?

1267
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,700
- Penicillin.
- Yeah.

1268
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,300
Any strong antibiotics.

1269
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,000
Yeah.

1270
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:51,500
Pain meds like Vicodin or OxyContin.

1271
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,100
- Shh!
- OxyContin!

1272
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,600
Hydrochloride?

1273
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:00,200
Penicillin.

1274
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:12,400
Guys.

1275
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,900
Hurry it up.
I hear something.

1276
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:22,800
What?

1277
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,600
Something weird.

1278
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,000
Oh, God.

1279
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,500
Oh, god.

1280
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,600
No. Oh, no.

1281
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,400
Oh, nooooo.

1282
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,000
Oh,

1283
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,900
Look.
There's another one.

1284
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,799
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no.

1285
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,200
Oh, no, no.

1286
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,900
Guys, let's get out of here <i>now.</i>

1287
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,800
Aaaahhhhhh!

1288
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,400
Oh!

1289
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:13,900
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Help me!

1290
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,100
Good Lord!
Help him!

1291
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,400
Son.

1292
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,000
This stuff ain't coming' off!

1293
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,400
Oh, man!
He's glued to this ' post!

1294
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,300
It's our fault.

1295
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,499
It's all our fault.

1296
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,000
It's really stuck.

1297
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:40,300
God, I can feel 'em!

1298
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,400
I can feel 'em!

1299
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,000
Oh, my God!

1300
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:54,800
Oh, my God.

1301
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:57,300
Ohh! I...

1302
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,800
Aaahhhh!

1303
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:03,400
Aah! Aaaaahhhhhh!

1304
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:08,600
There's more!

1305
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:09,700
Ohh!

1306
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,900
- Aah! Aah!
- There's another one! Hit it!

1307
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,099
- Aah!
- What the hell is that stuff?

1308
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,900
Ollie! One over there!

1309
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,600
Ollie, there!

1310
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:29,400
Got it!

1311
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:32,000
There, there, there!
Shoot! Shoot!

1312
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,200
Where are they?
You see 'em?

1313
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:40,300
- Where the hell are they?
- Aah! Aaaahhhhh!

1314
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,500
Bobby!

1315
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,200
Bobby!

1316
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,900
- Aaahhhh!
- Hold on, man! Hold on!

1317
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,700
- Hold on, man!
- Cut the strand!

1318
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,800
Help me!

1319
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:56,800
Let's get out of here!

1320
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:01,200
- A belt! Who's got a belt?
- I got a belt!

1321
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,000
- Aaaaahhhhhh!
- Hold it tight.

1322
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,700
- I got him, I got him. Hold on.
- I can't feel my...

1323
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,200
Pull it tight!

1324
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:13,400
Look! Look!

1325
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:16,100
Aaahhh! Aaaaahhhhhh!

1326
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,300
Ohhhhhh!

1327
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,100
Gaaahhhh!

1328
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,700
Light!

1329
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:23,800
Light!

1330
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:26,500
God!

1331
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:32,700
We gotta get outta here!
Come on!

1332
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,299
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

1333
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:37,300
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

1334
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,700
Let's get out of here!

1335
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:54,100
All right, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Come on!

1336
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,300
Come on!

1337
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,200
Oh, my God! We can't go.

1338
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,000
Ollie! Ollie!

1339
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,300
Kill it! Kill it!

1340
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,200
Oh, no! Oh, God, he's dead!

1341
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:29,900
He's dead! Get out of here!
Let's go, let's go!

1342
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,300
Drayton, come on,
come on, come on!

1343
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,400
Come on, Drayton, he's dead!
Come on!

1344
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,900
Open the door!

1345
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:09,700
Where's Bobby?

1346
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:10,800
Daddy!

1347
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:13,400
Close up the doors!

1348
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:14,599
Hurry up!

1349
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,100
What happened?

1350
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,900
They're dead!
They're all dead!

1351
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,800
Expiation, because we have seen

1352
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:40,499
the earth scourged
with whips and scorpions.

1353
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:44,500
We have seen the earth
vomit forth from her lips

1354
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:49,000
obscenities and profanities
of such nightmare proportions.

1355
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:52,900
And for these evil, lurking spirits,

1356
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
and for these evil people...

1357
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,400
How long was I out?

1358
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:57,900
Most of the day.

1359
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:01,500
You just came over here,
lay down, and went to sleep.

1360
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,100
Just passed out, is more like it.

1361
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,700
What will stop this Great Whore?

1362
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,700
Just shut down for a while. Sorry.

1363
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,400
How will it end?

1364
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:10,500
Expiation!

1365
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:13,199
Expiation!
Do you remember yesterday when...

1366
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:14,900
How's Joe?

1367
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,500
Dead. Joe died of his burns
while you were asleep.

1368
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:20,800
We were just too late.

1369
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:24,700
- I <i>told</i> you this would come!
- Oh, God, I thought I was dreaming her voice.

1370
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,100
No dream.

1371
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,300
She's getting people whipped up.

1372
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:33,600
That poor girl is dead,
and that boy is burnt in the back room!

1373
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:37,599
She's got 'em believing she's a psychic;
She has a direct line with God.

1374
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,100
Why wouldn't they?
Woman never shuts up.

1375
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,500
Like those speeches
Castro used to make.

1376
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:48,600
Ollie says you're thinking of leaving.

1377
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,000
I'm in.

1378
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:52,000
No. Sorry.

1379
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:55,900
I mean, come on, you saw what
happened to Bobby... Mike...

1380
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,700
I won't... do that again.
I won't be responsible.

1381
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,300
You might want to reconsider that.

1382
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:04,700
What will... what will keep
these evil, these abominations at bay?

1383
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,300
What will keep them away?

1384
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:09,299
"The rock will not hide them.
The dead tree gives no shelter."

1385
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:10,800
What will end it?
Let me hear it.

1386
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:12,900
- Expiation!
- So what are we talking about?

1387
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,500
- Expiation!
- Yeah, say it again like you mean it!

1388
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,800
Expiation!

1389
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:21,900
Welcome to <i>Sesame Street.</i>
Today's word is "expiation."

1390
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,099
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

1391
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:26,700
That boy hasn't been right
since the pharmacy.

1392
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,800
His mind's just snapped. Gone.

1393
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,500
Hasn't even been two days.

1394
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,000
Not even two days.

1395
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:36,699
I'm not spending' the rest
of my life here, I'll tell you what.

1396
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:39,400
I can quietly gather up
some bags of groceries

1397
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:42,800
and hide them up at one of
the check stands by the door.

1398
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:45,200
It was your idea.
It's your vehicle.

1399
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:46,800
It'll be your call.

1400
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:51,200
I'd rather die out there trying
than in here waiting.

1401
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:55,600
Who will save them? No one.

1402
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:58,799
These rocks <i>will</i> not hide them.

1403
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:03,600
I want some idea of what we're up against.
I want to know what this mist is.

1404
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:07,500
- I want to talk to the soldiers.
- Soldiers? What's that gonna do?

1405
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,700
You heard what that M.P. said
at the pharmacy.

1406
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,100
David, I'm not even sure
I knew he was talking.

1407
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,899
The situation was insane.

1408
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:15,700
He said he was sorry.

1409
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,800
Wasn't that the word
he used... "sorry"?

1410
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:20,199
That's right.
He said it was their fault, right?

1411
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:24,100
- What did he mean by that?
- That's what we're gonna find out.

1412
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,800
Irene, stay with Billy, please.

1413
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:27,200
Verse 17!

1414
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,799
"Poured out his vial into the air,

1415
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,700
"and there came a great voice

1416
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,500
"out of the temple of heaven
from the throne, saying,

1417
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:37,100
"'It is done! It is done!'

1418
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:40,400
"And there were voices
and lightning,

1419
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:43,500
and thunders,
and a great earthquake."

1420
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,300
Yes! Come to me!

1421
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,500
What?

1422
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,800
- Where's your friends?
- I ain't seen 'em.

1423
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:52,199
Not that big a store.
It's kinda hard to lose.

1424
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,200
I ain't seen 'em, I said.
I look like their keeper?

1425
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,300
- What do you want from me?
- What do you know about this mist?

1426
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,800
I don't know nothin'.
I got nothin' to do with it.

1427
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:07,700
That's not what the M.P. said in the pharmacy
before the spiders came out of his skin.

1428
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:10,900
They're not in the store.

1429
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,100
The only place we haven't looked
is the loading dock.

1430
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,299
Because you know.

1431
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:17,400
You saw the good face
of God tonight.

1432
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:18,799
Yes? Tell us.

1433
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,099
Here is an old man who has seen!

1434
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:23,299
Yes, he has <i>seen!</i>

1435
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:28,100
And I <i>want</i> to say,
do I want to walk with you

1436
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,900
into my Father's hands?

1437
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:32,400
Morales.

1438
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:34,500
Donaldson.

1439
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:38,300
Guys...

1440
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:44,000
- It's the only place they can be.
- What?

1441
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:45,500
Couldn't just disappear.

1442
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,600
Look, I told you,
okay, I don't know where they are...

1443
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:57,400
I didn't think they'd do it.

1444
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,800
They said they would do it, and I just...

1445
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:03,299
I told them what the M.P. said at the
pharmacy, and they swore they'd do it.

1446
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:06,100
I just... I didn't think
they would. Oh!

1447
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:09,399
It's the Arrowhead Project, isn't it?

1448
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,900
This mist, it's some kind of,
what, military.

1449
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,776
What were you guys
messing' with up there, huh?

1450
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,600
We got you now,
you sorry son.

1451
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:18,700
Get in there!

1452
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,700
It was them!
It was them what done it to us!

1453
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:25,300
It was them what brung down
the final wrath upon us!

1454
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,800
Those two peckerwoods
that he's been with this whole time,

1455
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:30,200
they hung themselves in the back
because they knew!

1456
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:31,800
They knew it all along!

1457
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:33,799
- He's crazy. He doesn't know...
- Get on your knees!

1458
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,100
Stay out of it, Drayton!

1459
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:37,299
They heard it too, didn't you?
All of ya!

1460
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:40,799
All about the Arrowhead Project and
all that secret up on the mountain.

1461
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,300
That's what brung it down on us.

1462
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,500
That's what brung down the wrath of God!

1463
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:45,600
Oh!

1464
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,400
Private Jessup.

1465
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:52,400
It wasn't <i>me.</i>

1466
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:54,800
I'm just...
I'm <i>stationed</i> up there.

1467
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:56,300
I'm not responsible...

1468
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,000
Hell, I'm a local!

1469
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:00,100
Most of you people know me.

1470
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:05,300
You stop your chicken whining
or I will cut your puling tongue out.

1471
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:07,000
Now you tell us!

1472
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,199
Tell us.

1473
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,900
Look, look. Okay, okay.

1474
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,400
I heard stuff.

1475
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:15,800
Stuff?

1476
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,900
Yes, we all heard stuff.

1477
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:23,000
Like how they, um...

1478
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:25,100
how they thought
that there were other dimensions,

1479
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:28,000
you know, other...
other worlds all around us,

1480
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:30,600
and how they wanted
to try and make, um,

1481
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:32,100
a window...

1482
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:34,961
you know, so they could look through
and see what's on the other side.

1483
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:39,800
Well, maybe your window
turned out to be a door. Didn't it?

1484
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:41,700
Not mine! Those scientists'!

1485
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:44,399
- Oh, the scientists!
- Yes, the scientists!

1486
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,500
They must have ripped
a hole open by accident.

1487
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,440
This other world
came spilling through to ours.

1488
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:51,800
That's what Donaldson was saying
to me right before he killed himself.

1489
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:53,900
I didn't understand the half of it.

1490
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,400
It ain't my fault!

1491
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:58,500
Oh.

1492
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,900
Ain't. His. Fault.

1493
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,500
No, no, no.

1494
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,600
Ain't nothin' ever anybody's fault.

1495
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:12,000
But he denies it.

1496
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:14,599
He points the finger,

1497
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:17,800
this Judas in our midst.

1498
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:18,900
Judas!

1499
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,700
David!

1500
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,100
You! You!

1501
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:25,100
Don't you know by now?

1502
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,200
Don't you know the truth?

1503
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:29,900
We are being punished.

1504
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,500
For what? For going
against the will of God!

1505
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,900
For going against
His forbidden rules of old!

1506
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,400
Walking on the moon!

1507
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,000
Yes! Yes!

1508
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:43,999
Or... or splitting His atoms!

1509
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,799
Or... or... or stem cells and abortions!

1510
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,800
And destroying the secrets of life

1511
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:55,100
that only God above has any right to!

1512
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:59,399
Yes, I know! It is true!

1513
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:02,000
And now we are being punished.

1514
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:05,000
The judgment is being
brought down upon us.

1515
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:07,700
The fiends of hell,
you see they are let loose,

1516
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:11,499
and star Wormwood blazes!

1517
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:12,800
And it is his fault!

1518
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:16,200
No! No! It is not my fault! No!

1519
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:19,300
<i>They</i> did it! They spit
in the eye of the Almighty!

1520
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,400
No!

1521
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,600
Get over there!

1522
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:24,300
No!

1523
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,000
Judas!

1524
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:28,300
Jim!

1525
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,800
Kill him! String him up!

1526
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,600
Stand up, you coward!

1527
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:36,700
Unkh!

1528
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:45,500
No!

1529
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,000
Aaaahhhh!

1530
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:49,200
Expiation!

1531
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:50,900
- No!
- Stab him!

1532
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,400
- Aaahhhh!
- Expiation!

1533
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:57,199
Feed him to the beast!

1534
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,200
Expiation!

1535
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:03,300
Let the abominations
smell his blood!

1536
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,400
No, no! No!

1537
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:09,100
Aaaaahhhhh!

1538
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:12,400
- Wait!
- No, David!

1539
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:19,600
Aaahhhh!

1540
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:32,200
Aaahhhh!

1541
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,800
Aah! Aaahhh!

1542
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:46,900
Aaahhhh!

1543
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Aaahhh! Aah!

1544
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:10,500
Please.

1545
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:23,800
The beast will leave us alone tonight.

1546
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:26,500
Tomorrow...

1547
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:30,200
tomorrow, we'll just
have to wait and see.

1548
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:40,700
Daddy.

1549
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:43,500
Daddy.

1550
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:57,200
Sorry I left you, pal.

1551
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:01,200
I'll never leave you again.

1552
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:03,700
Promise?

1553
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:08,800
But you have to give me
your best promise, okay?

1554
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:12,300
Your very best promise,
and can never break it.

1555
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,100
Tell me.

1556
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:18,200
Promise you won't let
the monsters get me.

1557
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:24,000
Ever. No matter what.

1558
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:27,200
I promise.

1559
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,200
I love you, Daddy.

1560
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:34,200
I love you, Billy.

1561
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,500
More than anything.

1562
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,400
It's dawn.

1563
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:15,699
Hey, pal, you ready to go home?

1564
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:17,100
Come on.

1565
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,500
Okay, I got the groceries
hidden at check stand number two.

1566
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:25,100
Five bags. We can grab 'em
and get out the door.

1567
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:26,499
Okay.

1568
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:30,299
My car's parked in the center lane
of the parking lot, far end.

1569
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:32,500
Whoever gets there first,
open up both doors,

1570
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:35,299
and we'll all pile in
as fast as we can, okay?

1571
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:36,500
Let's go.

1572
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:02,100
Stealing food now?

1573
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:08,300
Going out now, Mrs. Carmody.

1574
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:11,300
Please stand aside.

1575
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:15,300
You can't go out.
I won't allow it.

1576
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:16,700
Won't allow it?

1577
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:19,400
It's against God's will.

1578
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,600
Don't you know that by now?

1579
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:26,200
Haven't I proven myself
again and again and again?

1580
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:30,800
Haven't I shown that I am His vessel?

1581
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:37,200
What's the matter with you?

1582
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:41,900
Don't you believe in God?

1583
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:44,500
No one's interfered with you.

1584
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:47,200
All we're asking for
is the same privilege.

1585
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:48,600
You heard him.

1586
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:54,200
It is these people
who brought this upon us.

1587
01:38:55,400 --> 01:39:00,400
They... people who refused
to bend to the will of God,

1588
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:03,100
and claim it privilege.

1589
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:06,200
Sinners in pride.

1590
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:08,300
Yes, haughty.

1591
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,400
Privileged!

1592
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:14,300
They mock us. They mock our...
our God, our faith,

1593
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:17,800
our values, our very lifestyle.

1594
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:20,100
They mock our humility

1595
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,100
and our piousness.

1596
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:25,200
They piss on us and laugh.

1597
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:33,700
It's from them the blood
of human sacrifice must come.

1598
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,799
From them...

1599
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:38,400
- Come on.
- The blood of expiation.

1600
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:39,500
Come on.

1601
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,100
You try it.

1602
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:42,500
' Try it!

1603
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:44,099
Come on!

1604
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:46,300
- Get 'em!
- We want the boy.

1605
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,800
- We want the boy!
- You get back!

1606
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:50,000
- Yeah!
- You get back!

1607
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:51,000
The boy!

1608
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:52,500
David! David!

1609
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:54,400
Grab that boy! Grab him!

1610
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:56,800
Get off me!

1611
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:58,399
Get off me! Get off me!

1612
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,800
Grab him!

1613
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:03,200
And get the whore too!

1614
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:04,800
Grab her!

1615
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:07,200
Kill 'em! Kill 'em all!

1616
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:24,000
Stay down!
Stay down! Stay down!

1617
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:32,700
I... I killed her.

1618
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:36,100
Thank you, Ollie.

1619
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:39,300
Let's go.

1620
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,600
Get that ice machine
out of the way, please.

1621
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:47,800
You killed her!

1622
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:50,200
You <i>murdered</i> her!

1623
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:56,999
I wouldn't have shot her, Dave,
not if there'd been any other way.

1624
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,500
That's why I said thank you.

1625
01:40:58,600 --> 01:40:59,799
Okay.

1626
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:02,100
Okay, then... let's go!

1627
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:05,100
Get up, Myron!

1628
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:07,600
- Come on! We gotta go!
- My ankle!

1629
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:20,200
Okay. All the way down!
Where are they?

1630
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:22,700
Bud! Myron!

1631
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:23,800
Ambrose!

1632
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:25,500
I think I broke it!

1633
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,100
Come on! Come on!

1634
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,699
We gotta go!
Come on, come on!

1635
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:30,000
They're lost!

1636
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:39,300
- Oh.
- Ollie!

1637
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:41,999
Ollie!

1638
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Aaahhhh!

1639
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:46,000
Aaaaahhhhhh!

1640
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,100
- Oh!
- Aaahhh!

1641
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,099
Ohh!

1642
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:03,500
Aaah! Aaaahhhh!

1643
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:08,000
Aaah! Aaaaahhhhh!

1644
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:23,000
All that screaming!

1645
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:26,500
Are they out there?
Can they see us?

1646
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,800
Let me... let me in!
Let me in!

1647
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:54,700
Are we going?

1648
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:02,800
- No.
- Yeah.

1649
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:05,000
- No! No!
- Yeah!

1650
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:06,400
- Daddy.
- David.

1651
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:08,400
- David, no.
- Daddy, no.

1652
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:10,200
- David!
- Daddy!

1653
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:11,800
Get back in the car!

1654
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:13,500
- Daddy!
- David!

1655
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:25,500
Oh, my God!

1656
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:26,900
Aaahhh!

1657
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,400
Oh, my God!

1658
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:51,500
We gotta go.

1659
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:52,800
I told her I'd fix it.

1660
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:59,500
Front window... broken open.

1661
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:04,400
Tree.

1662
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:09,900
My... grandfather's tree.

1663
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,300
I'm sorry, David,
I'm just so sorry.

1664
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:47,900
Let's, uh... see how far this...

1665
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:51,900
fuel takes us, huh?

1666
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Maybe we'll get clear of the mist.

1667
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:14,600
Well...

1668
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:17,800
we gave it a good shot.

1669
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:20,700
Nobody can say we didn't.

1670
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:24,400
Nope.

1671
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:26,300
Nobody can say that.

1672
01:51:55,300 --> 01:51:56,600
Well...

1673
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:00,100
We got, uh...

1674
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:05,800
four.

1675
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,300
Four bullets.

1676
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:17,300
But there's five of us.

1677
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:29,700
I'll figure something out.

1678
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:40,200
Aaaaahhhhh!

1679
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:42,600
Aaahhh!

1680
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:24,000
Aah! Aah!

1681
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:29,900
Come on!

1682
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:37,200
Come on!

1683
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:40,000
Come on!

1684
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:46,400
Come on. Come on.

1685
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:49,600
Come on.

1686
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:58,200
Come on.

1687
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,000
Come on.

1688
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:01,800
Come on.

1689
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,900
Come on, <i>come on!</i>

1690
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:07,900
Come on! Come on!

1691
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,499
They're... they're dead.

1692
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:49,000
For what?

1693
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:55,700
Aah!

1694
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:58,300
Aaaaahhhhhh!
