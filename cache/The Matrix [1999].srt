<i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>

165
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,140
No way! No way! This is crazy!

166
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,770
<i>There are two ways out of this building.</i>

167
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,810
<i>One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.</i>

168
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,280
<i>You take a chance either way. I leave it to you.</i>

169
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,610
This is insane!

170
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,660
Why is this happening to me?

171
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,580
What'd I do?

172
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,710
I'm nobody. I didn't do anything.

173
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,760
I'm gonna die.

174
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,590
Shit!

175
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,990
Oh, shit!

176
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,750
I can't do this.

177
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,430
Shit.

178
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:53,520
As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

179
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,730
It seems that you've been living...

180
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,870
two lives.

181
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,780
In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson...

182
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,380
program writer for a respectable software company.

183
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,710
You have a social security number. You pay your taxes.

184
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,420
And you...

185
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,630
help your landlady carry out her garbage.

186
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,260
The other life is lived in computers...

187
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,520
where you go by the hacker alias "Neo"...

188
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,570
and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for.

189
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,820
One of these lives...

190
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,900
has a future.

191
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
And one of them does not.

192
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,790
I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

193
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,120
You're here...

194
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,710
because we need your help.

195
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,590
We know that you've been contacted by a certain...

196
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,390
individual.

197
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:06,350
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

198
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,350
Whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant.

199
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,020
He is considered by many authorities...

200
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,320
to be the most dangerous man alive.

201
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,280
My colleagues...

202
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,620
believe that I am wasting my time with you.

203
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,330
But I believe you wish to do the right thing.

204
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,130
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

205
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,630
give you a fresh start.

206
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,050
All we're asking in return is your cooperation...

207
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,800
in bringing a known terrorist to justice.

208
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,430
Yeah.

209
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,810
That sounds like a really good deal.

210
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,180
But I got a better one.

211
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,940
How about...

212
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,350
I give you the finger...

213
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,990
and you give me my phone call.

214
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,990
Mr. Anderson...

215
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,200
you disappoint me.

216
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,080
You can't scare me with this gestapo crap.

217
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,710
I know my rights.

218
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,460
I want my phone call.

219
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,210
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

220
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,510
what good is a phone call...

221
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,350
if you're unable to speak?

222
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,340
You're going to help us, Mr. Anderson...

223
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,130
whether you want to or not.

224
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,940
<i>This line is tapped, so I must be brief.</i>

225
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,490
<i>They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.</i>

226
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,330
<i>If they knew what I know...</i>

227
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,580
<i>you would probably be dead.</i>

228
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,290
What are you talking about? What is happening to me?

229
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:23,380
<i>You are the One, Neo. You may have spent the last few years...</i>

230
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,590
<i>looking for me, but I've spent my entire life...</i>

231
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,340
<i>looking for you.</i>

232
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,050
<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>

233
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,890
Yes.
- <i>Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>

234
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,320
Get in.

235
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,210
What's this?
- It's necessary, Neo. For our protection.

236
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,630
From what?
- From you.

237
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,640
Take off your shirt.

238
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,930
Stop the car.

239
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,970
Listen, coppertop.

240
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,980
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

241
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,860
Right now, there's only one rule:

242
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,480
Our way...

243
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,900
or the highway.

244
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,530
Fine.

245
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,870
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

246
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,080
Why?
- Because you have been down there.

247
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,040
You know that road.

248
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,710
You know exactly where it ends.

249
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,130
And I know that's not where you want to be.

250
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,860
Apoc, lights.

251
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,530
Lie back. Lift up your shirt.

252
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,700
What's that?
- You're bugged.

253
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,920
Try and relax.

254
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,390
Come on.

255
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,640
Come on.

256
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,310
It's on the move.

257
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,220
Come on, you shit.

258
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,310
You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

259
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,560
Clear!

260
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,290
Jesus Christ! That thing's real?!

261
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,360
This is it.

262
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,160
Let me give you one piece of advice.

263
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,780
Be honest.

264
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,580
He knows more than you can imagine.

265
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,630
At last.

266
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,260
Welcome, Neo.

267
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,390
As you no doubt have guessed...

268
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,890
I am Morpheus.

269
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,520
It's an honor to meet you.

270
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,010
No...

271
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,890
the honor is mine.

272
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,310
Please, come. Sit.

273
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,050
I imagine...

274
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,220
that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice...

275
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,340
tumbling down the rabbit hole? Hm?

276
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,170
You could say that.

277
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,810
I can see it in your eyes.

278
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,680
You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees...

279
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,180
because he's expecting to wake up.

280
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,230
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.

281
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,400
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

282
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,990
No.
- Why not?

283
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,030
I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.

284
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,460
I know exactly what you mean.

285
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,130
Let me tell you why you're here.

286
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,720
You know something.

287
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,890
What you know, you can't explain.

288
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,970
But you feel it.

289
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,470
You felt it your entire life.

290
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,859
That there's something's wrong with the world.

291
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,720
You don't know what, but it's there.

292
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,180
Like a splinter in your mind...

293
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,070
driving you mad.

294
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,740
It is this feeling that has brought you to me.

295
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,110
Do you know what I'm talking about?

296
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,280
The Matrix?

297
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,450
Do you want to know...

298
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,910
what it is?

299
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,170
The Matrix is everywhere.

300
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,130
It is all around us.

301
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,340
Even now, in this very room.

302
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,630
You can see it when you look out your window...

303
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,970
or when you turn on your television.

304
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,930
You can feel it when you go to work...

305
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,140
when you go to church...

306
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,640
when you pay your taxes.

307
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,940
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes...

308
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,530
to blind you from the truth.

309
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,990
What truth?

310
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,730
That you are a slave, Neo.

311
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,020
Like everyone else, you were born into bondage...

312
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:30,360
born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.

313
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,080
A prison...

314
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,810
for your mind.

315
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,470
[MORPHEUS SIGHS]

316
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,800
Unfortunately, no one can be...

317
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,520
told what the Matrix is.

318
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,860
You have to see it for yourself.

319
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,660
This is your last chance.

320
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,240
After this, there is no turning back.

321
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,210
You take the blue pill...

322
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:10,540
the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe...

323
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,830
whatever you want to believe.

324
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,170
You take the red pill...

325
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,390
you stay in Wonderland...

326
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,590
and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

327
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,680
Remember...

328
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:34,570
all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.

329
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,210
Follow me.

330
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,420
Apoc, are we on-line?

331
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,050
Almost.

332
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,430
Time is always against us.

333
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,300
Please take a seat there.

334
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,520
You did all this?
- Uh-mm.

335
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,540
The pill you took is part of a trace program.

336
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,689
It's designed to disrupts your input/output carrier signal...

337
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,780
so we can pinpoint your location.

338
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,290
What does that mean?

339
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,050
It means buckle your seat belt, Dorothy...

340
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,720
because Kansas...

341
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,069
is going bye-bye.

342
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,600
[THUNDER]

343
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,310
Did you...?

344
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,400
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?

345
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:40,440
What if you were unable to wake from that dream?

346
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,190
How would you know the difference between the dream world...

347
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,240
and the real world?

348
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,250
This can't be.
- Be what?

349
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,460
Be real?

350
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,370
It's going into replication.
- Apoc?

351
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,090
Still nothing.
- NEO: It's cold.

352
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,470
It's cold!

353
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,010
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

354
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,180
I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

355
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,900
Targeting almost there.

356
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,850
He's going into arrest.

357
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,360
Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

358
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,930
Holy shit.

359
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,070
Whoa.

360
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,710
Welcome...

361
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,960
to the real world.

362
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,210
We've done it, Trinity.

363
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,250
We found him.

364
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,050
I hope you're right.
- I don't have to hope.

365
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,220
I know it.

366
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,430
Am I dead?

367
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,100
Far from it.

368
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,490
He still needs a lot of work.

369
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,120
What are you doing?

370
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,590
Your muscles atrophied. We're rebuilding them.

371
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,720
Why do my eyes hurt?

372
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,300
You've never used them before.

373
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:12,020
Rest, Neo. The answers are coming.

374
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,880
[METAL DOOR OPENS]

375
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,170
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

376
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:32,800
What is this place?
- More important than "what" is "when."

377
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,840
When?
- You believe it's the year 1999...

378
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:39,100
when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

379
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,980
I can't tell you exactly what year it is...

380
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,860
because we honestly don't know.

381
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,440
There's nothing I can say that will explain it for you.

382
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,610
Come with me.

383
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,190
See for yourself.

384
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,330
MORPHEUS: This is my ship.

385
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,710
The Nebuchadnezzar. It's a hovercraft.

386
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,290
This is the main deck.

387
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,300
This is the core...

388
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:14,550
where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the Matrix.

389
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,100
Most of my crew you already know.

390
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,520
This is Apoc...

391
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,650
Switch...

392
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,810
and Cypher.
- Hi.

393
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,520
The ones you don't know: Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

394
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,680
The little one behind you is Mouse.

395
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,820
You wanted to know... what the Matrix is, Neo?

396
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,500
Trinity.

397
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,110
Try to relax.

398
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,820
This will feel a little weird.

399
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,970
This...

400
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,050
is the Construct.

401
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,840
It's our loading program.

402
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,550
We can load anything, from clothing...

403
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,940
to equipment...

404
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,560
weapons...

405
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,020
training simulations...

406
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,940
anything we need.

407
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,150
Right now we're inside a computer program?

408
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,360
Is it really so hard to believe?

409
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,490
Your clothes are different. The plugs in your arms and head are gone.

410
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,780
Your hair has changed.

411
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:05,500
Your appearance now is what we call "residual self-image."

412
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,830
It is the mental projection of your digital self.

413
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,080
This...?

414
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,160
This isn't real?

415
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:17,710
What is "real"?

416
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,390
How do you define "real"?

417
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,800
If you're talking about what you can feel...

418
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,459
what you can smell, what you can taste and see...

419
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,480
then "real" is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.

420
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:35,860
This is the world that you know.

421
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,320
The world as it was at the end of the 20th century.

422
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:47,040
It exists now only as part of a neural-interactive simulation...

423
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,540
that we call the Matrix.

424
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,930
You've been living in a dream world, Neo.

425
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,000
This is the world...

426
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,100
as it exists today.

427
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:16,070
Welcome to "the desert...

428
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,530
of the real."

429
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,629
We have only bits and pieces of information.

430
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,220
But what we know for certain...

431
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,520
is that at some point in the early 21st century...

432
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:32,139
all of mankind was united in celebration.

433
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:37,719
We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to AI.

434
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,830
AI.

435
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,420
You mean Artificial Intelligence.

436
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:45,850
A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines.

437
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:50,650
We don't know who struck first, us or them.

438
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,860
But we know that it was us that scorched the sky.

439
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,959
At the time, they were dependent on solar power...

440
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,660
and it was believed that they would be unable to survive...

441
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,169
without an energy source as abundant as the sun.

442
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:10,050
Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive.

443
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:15,840
Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.

444
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:23,470
The human body generates more bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

445
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:27,860
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

446
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,930
Combined with a form of fusion...

447
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:37,110
the machines had found all the energy they would ever need.

448
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,910
There are fields, Neo, endless fields...

449
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:48,420
where human beings are no longer born.

450
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,950
We are grown.

451
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,580
For the longest time, I wouldn't believe it.

452
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,520
And then I saw the fields with my own eyes...

453
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,720
watched them liquefy the dead...

454
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:09,060
so they could be fed intravenously to the living.

455
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:13,850
And standing there, facing the pure, horrifying precision...

456
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,030
I came to realize the obviousness of the truth.

457
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,450
What is the Matrix?

458
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,690
Control.

459
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,450
The Matrix is a computer-generated dream world...

460
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:32,340
built to keep us under control...

461
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,670
in order to change a human being...

462
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,460
into this.

463
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:40,960
No.

464
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,180
I don't believe it.

465
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,760
It's not possible.

466
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,670
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.

467
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,239
I just said it would be the truth.

468
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,820
Stop!

469
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,280
Let me out!

470
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,850
Let me out! I want out!

471
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,730
Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

472
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,400
Get this thing out of me!

473
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,700
Don't touch me!

474
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,580
Stay away from me!

475
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,490
I don't believe it.

476
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:12,410
I don't believe it.

477
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:14,410
I don't believe it.

478
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,920
He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo. Just breathe.

479
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,110
I can't go back, can I?

480
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,020
No.

481
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,400
But if you could...

482
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,740
would you really want to?

483
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:49,340
I feel I owe you an apology.

484
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:50,720
We have a rule.

485
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:54,660
We never free a mind once it's reached a certain age.

486
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:57,960
It's dangerous. The mind has trouble letting go.

487
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,510
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

488
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:03,630
I did what I did because...

489
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:05,810
I had to.

490
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:18,310
When the Matrix was first built, there was a man born inside...

491
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,610
who had the ability to change whatever he wanted...

492
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:25,910
to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

493
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:31,120
It was he who freed the first of us...

494
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,630
taught us the truth.

495
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:38,170
As long as the Matrix exists...

00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,300
A sentinel. A killing machine designed for one thing.

663
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,760
Search and destroy.

664
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,270
Set her down there.

665
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:01,210
How are we doing, Tank?

666
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,930
Power off-line.

667
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:12,590
EMP armed...

668
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,470

- EMP?

669
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:16,640
Electro-Magnetic Pulse.

670
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:20,010
Disables any electrical system in the blast radius.

671
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,230
It's the only weapon we have against the machines.

672

Where are we?
- Their old service and waste systems.

673

Sewers.

674
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:36,450
There used to be cities that spanned hundreds of miles.

675
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,870
Now these sewers are all that's left.

676

Quiet.

677
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:23,250
Whoa! Neo!

678
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:26,460
You scared the bejesus out of me.

679
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,570
Sorry.
- It's okay.

680
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:35,100
Is that...?
- The Matrix?

681
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,610
Yeah.

682
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:41,680
Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

683
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:44,770
The image translators work for the construct program.

684
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:48,440
But there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.

685
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,650
You get used to it. I don't even see the code.

Sure.

I know what you're thinking.

692
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,380
Because right now I'm thinking the same thing.

693
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:14,010
Actually, I've been thinking it ever since I got here.

694
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:18,930
Why, oh, why didn't I take the blue pill?

695

Good shit, huh?

696

Dozer makes it.

697
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,650
It's good for two things:

698
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:39,750
Degreasing engines and killing brain cells.

699
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,960
So can I ask you something?

700
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,590
Did he tell you why he did it?

701
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,040
Why you're here?

702
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,470
Jesus!

703
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,590
What a mind job.

704
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:04,810
So you're here to save the world.

705
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,390
What do you say to something like that?

706
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:14,950
A little piece of advice.

I know this steak doesn't exist.

I know that when I put it in my mouth...

You know what it reminds me of?

742
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:38,420
Tastee Wheat. Did you ever eat Tastee Wheat?

743
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,760
No, but technically, neither did you.

744
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,050
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

745
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:44,680
Because you have to wonder...

746
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:48,430
how do the machines really know what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

747
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,850
Maybe they got it wrong.

748
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:53,310
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat tasted like actually tasted like...

749
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:55,600
oatmeal or tuna fish.

750
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:58,820
That makes you wonder. Take chicken, for example.

751
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,070
Maybe they didn't know what to make it taste like...

752
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:03,610
which is why it tastes like everything.

753

I understand you've run through the Agent training program.

759

You know, I wrote that program.

The woman in the red dress. I designed her.

She doesn't talk very much...

To deny our own impulses...

768
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:50,750
is to deny the very thing that makes us human.

What does that mean?

790
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:48,830
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.

I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.

1182

01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:40,110
during my time here.

1190
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:44,120
It came to me when I tried to classify your species...

1191
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:46,870
and I realized that...

1192

you're not actually mammals.

1193
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:53,840
Every mammal on this planet...

1194
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:59,340
instinctively develops a natural equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1195
01:37:59,350 --> 01:38:01,180
But you humans do not.

1196
01:38:01,730 --> 01:38:05,260
You move to an area and you multiply...

1197
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:10,020
and multiply until every natural resource is consumed.

1198
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:12,440
The only way you can survive...

1199
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:15,690
is to spread to another area.

1200
