1
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:37,038
This the wall
she was talking about, Chief?

2
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:49,217
A trooper found
something in the, uh...

3
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,095
water that's at the quarry.

4
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:55,431
Our working theory right now
is that Will...

5
00:00:55,515 --> 00:01:00,061
crashed his bike, he...
made his way over the quarry and, uh...

6
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:02,105
accidentally fell in.

7
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:05,567
The earth must have given way.

8
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:10,738
Joyce?

9
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:14,200
Joyce?

10
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:15,952
Do you understand what I'm saying?

11
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,245
No.

12
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:21,457
Whoever you found...

13
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,042
is not my boy.

14
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:24,961
-It's not Will.
-Joyce.

15
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:27,213
No, you don't understand.

16
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,049
I talked to him...

17
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,551
a half hour ago.

18
00:01:32,552 --> 00:01:34,721
He was...
He was here.

19
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:37,098
He was...
He was talking with these.

20
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:38,808
-Talking?
-Uh-huh.

21
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,227
One blink for yes, two for no.

22
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,813
And... And, uh...

23
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:48,776
And then I made this
so he could talk to me.

24
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,195
'Cause he was hiding...

25
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:53,364
from that... that thing.

26
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:54,824
The thing that came out of the wall?

27
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,117
-The thing that chased you?
-Yeah.

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,411
-Yeah.
-Mom, come on, please.

29
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,538
-You've gotta stop this.
-No, maybe he's...

30
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:01,914
It's after him!

31
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:05,460
-He's in danger. We have to find him! We--
-What exactly was this thing?

32
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:06,919
It was some kind of animal, you said?

33
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:08,004
Uh, no, it was...

34
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:11,341
It was almost... human,
but it wasn't. It...

35
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:15,470
It had these long arms and...
it didn't have a face.

36
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,472
It didn't have a face?

37
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,975
- Joyce.
- It didn't have a face...

38
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:22,352
Joyce, listen to me.

39
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:23,895
Listen to me.

40
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:28,066
After Sarah...

41
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:32,070
I saw her, too.

42
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,237
And I heard her.

43
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:38,117
I didn't know what was real.

44
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,370
And then I figured out
that it was in my mind.

45
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:42,497
And I had to pack all that away.

46
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,792
Otherwise, I was gonna fall down a hole...

47
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,668
that I couldn't get out of.

48
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:51,589
No, you're...
you're talking about grief.

49
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,924
This is different.

50
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:57,470
-I'm just saying that you--
-No, I know what you're saying, Hop.

51
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:01,766
I swear to you,
I know what I saw.

52
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,102
And I'm not crazy.

53
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:06,020
I'm not saying that you're crazy.

54
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:08,022
No...
You are.

55
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:10,733
And I understand, but...

56
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:13,236
God, I...

57
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,905
I need you to believe me.

58
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:19,033
Please.

59
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:20,993
Please.

60
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:22,078
Listen...

61
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:27,458
I think you should go to the morgue
tomorrow and see him for yourself.

62
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,419
It'll give you the answers that you need.

63
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:30,878
-But tonight...
-Oh, God.

64
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:33,631
...I want you to try to get some sleep,
if you can.

65
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:36,003
Byers' body was found
in the water of this quarry

66
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,172
by state police earlier this evening.

67
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:42,009
It was discovered by state trooper
David O'Bannon, just after dark.

68
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:44,011
The state police
are mounting an investigation

69
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:45,972
to determine Byers' cause of death,

70
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:47,431
but an initial inquiry...

71
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:50,059
--Should I go down and talk to Michael?

72
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,313
Give him time.

73
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,148
He'll come to us when he's ready.

74
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,668
Can you please stop that?

75
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,425
Are you deaf?

76
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,678
I thought we were friends, you know?

77
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,597
But friends tell each other the truth.

78
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,307
And they definitely don't lie
to each other.

79
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,226
You made me think Will was okay,
that he was still out there,

80
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,270
but he wasn't.
He wasn't!

81
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,357
Maybe you thought you were helping,
but you weren't.

82
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:41,652
You hurt me.
Do you understand?

83
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:43,988
What you did sucks.

84
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:47,742
Lucas was right about you.

85
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:49,744
All along.

Will, is that you? It's Mike!
Do you copy?

93
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,235
Over.

94
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,822
- Will, are you there?

95
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:28,783
- Will!

96
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:36,749
Was that...

97
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:37,875
Was it...

98
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,838
Will.

99
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,374
Mom...

100
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,673
Mom!

101
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:09,175
Mom! Wake up.

102
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,302
What... what time is it?

103
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,055
It's almost 8:00.
We have to go.

104
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:16,474
Go where? Where?

105
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:18,726
To see Will.

106
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,814
--Michael?

107
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,027
Hi, honey.
How are you feeling?

108
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:30,696
I, uh...

109
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,657
I don't think I can go to school today.

110
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,451
Oh, that's fine, sweetie.

111
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:38,788
I need to drop off Nance,
then I'm gonna check in on Barb's parents.

112
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:41,207
Why don't you grab a book
or something and come with me?

113
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,334
We can stop by the video store
on the way back,

114
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,753
pick out whatever you want.
Even R-rated.

115
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,589
I think I just want to stay home today.

116
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,132
I mean, if that's okay?

117
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:53,511
Well, are you sure you're gonna be
all right here by yourself?

118
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,054
I think so.

119
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:58,015
Okay.

120
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,434
But if you need anything,
call Dad at work.

121
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:02,394
- Okay.
- Okay.

122
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,357
Bye.

123
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,942
Bye, sweetie.

124
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:14,782
Lucas, do you copy?

125
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,077
Lucas, come on, I know you're there!

126
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,870
This is urgent.
I'm serious.

127
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:25,292
I'm not gonna stop until you answer.

128
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:26,794
Lucas.

129
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,337
Lucas!

130
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,214
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas,
Lucas, Lucas...

131
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,591
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas,
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas--

132
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,135
Go away, Mike.

133
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:37,221
I'm not in the mood, all right?
Over and out.

134
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,681
No, not "out."

135
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,225
I'm not messing around, okay?
This is about Will.

136
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,227
-Over.
-What about Will?

137
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,729
You mean about his funeral?
Over.

138
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:46,981
No, not his funeral.

139
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,566
-Screw his funeral!
-What?

140
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,943
Just get over here stat.
And bring Dustin.

141
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,319
Over and out.

142
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,449
What's taking so long?

143
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:01,620
Well, everything's been a bit chaotic
around here without Gary.

144
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:03,581
Without Gary?

145
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:06,750
-Where's Gary?
-Well, I thought you knew.

146
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:10,212
Those men from State, they...
they sent Gary home last night.

147
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,674
So who did the autopsy?

148
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:15,843
Someone from State.

149
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,830
He has a birth mark on his right arm.

150
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:46,624
Can you show that to me, please?

151
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,339
How's your mom doing?

152
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,010
I don't know.

153
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:02,473
How long's this stuff been going on?
With the lights and, uh...

154
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,767
Will and the thing in the wall?

155
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,730
Since the first phone call, I guess.

156
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,403
You know, she's had anxiety problems...

157
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:17,696
in the past.

158
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:20,699
But this...

159
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,410
I don't know.

160
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,209
I'm worried it could be...

161
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:33,212
Ugh, I don't know.

162
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:39,093
She'll be okay.

163
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,512
We'll be okay.

164
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,266
My mom...

165
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,980
she's tough.

166
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:52,564
Yeah, she is.

167
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:56,485
Hey.

168
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,279
She is.

169
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,492
Ma'am!

170
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,119
-Ma'am, I need you to sign!
-I don't...

171
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:08,998
I don't know what you think that thing
is in there, but that is not my son!

172
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:10,833
-Joyce, wait a second.
-No!

173
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,043
- Mom!
- Ma'am, I-- Ma'am!

174
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,342
So, wait a sec. I don't understand.
You went back to my house?

175
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:21,802
To look for Barb.

176
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,971
Yeah, okay, but why didn't you
just talk to me?

177
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,681
That's crazy.

178
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,600
I don't know, I... I was scared.

179
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:31,311
You seriously think
you saw a guy in a mask

180
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,063
just hanging out in my yard?

181
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,898
I don't think it was a mask.

182
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,775
But he had no face?

183
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,778
I don't know!

184
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,739
I don't know, I just...

185
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,408
I have a terrible feeling about this.

186
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,534
Oh, this is bad.

187
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,161
This is really bad.

188
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,287
What?

189
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,247
The cops...

190
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,083
they're gonna want to talk
to all of us now.

191
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,670
Tommy, Carol,
everybody who was at the party.

192
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:58,714
-So?
-My parents are gonna murder me!

193
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:01,759
Are you serious right now?

194
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,927
You don't understand.
My dad's a grade-A asshole.

195
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:07,514
Barb is missing!
And you're worried about your dad?

196
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:10,934
Okay, just...
When you talk to the cops, just...

197
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,936
don't mention the beers.

198
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,813
It's just gonna get us both in trouble,

199
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:17,024
and Barbara's got nothing to do with it,
okay?

200
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:20,069
I can't believe you right now.

201
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:23,155
-I can't believe you.
-Nancy.

202
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:26,158
Nancy, wait!

203
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,078
Nancy!

204
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,039
- Mom, will you get in?
- No, I...

205
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,541
I need to think.
Just go on home.

206
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,585
Mom, will you just get in, please?

207
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:40,881
Mom.

208
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:43,717
Mom!

209
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,179
Mom.

210
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,640
-Stop.
-Just go home, Jonathan.

211
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,476
No, this is not an okay time
for you to shut down.

212
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,978
-Shut down? What...
-We have to deal with this, Mom.

213
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,772
We have to deal with the funeral!

214
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,315
The funeral?

215
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,318
- For... for who?
- For that thing back there?

216
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:03,445
Okay, let me get this straight.

217
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:06,698
Will, that's not his body,
because he's in the lights, right?

218
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:08,617
And there's a monster in the wall?

219
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,202
Do you even hear yourself?

220
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,205
I know it sounds crazy.

221
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,623
I sound crazy!

222
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,500
-Yeah.
-You think I don't know that?

223
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,751
It is crazy!

224
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,670
But I heard him, Jonathan.

225
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,422
He talked to me!

226
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:24,341
Will is... is calling to me!

227
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:28,303
And he's out there, and he's alone,
and he's scared, and I...

228
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:30,347
I don't care if anyone believes me!

229
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:35,018
I am not gonna stop looking for him
until I find him and bring him home.

230
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:38,188
I am going to bring him home!

231
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:41,066
Yeah, well,
while you're talking to the lights,

232
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,652
the rest of us are having
a funeral for Will!

233
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,780
I'm not letting him sit in that freezer
another day!

234
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,202
All right, show's over.

235
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:55,247
What?

236
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:11,346
We keep losing the signal,
but you heard it, right?

237
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,849
Yeah, I heard a baby.

238
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:14,975
What?

239
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:17,853
Mike, you obviously tapped
into a baby monitor.

240
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,521
It's probably the Blackburns' next door.

241
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,398
Uh, did that sound like a baby to you?

242
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:22,774
-That was Will!
-Mike...

243
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,068
Lucas, you don't understand.
He spoke last night.

244
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,361
Words!

245
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:29,198
He was singing that weird song he loves.
Even El heard him!

246
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:31,492
Oh, well, if the weirdo heard him,
then I guess--

247
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:32,826
Are you sure you're on the right channel?

248
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,911
I don't think it's about that.

249
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,664
I think, somehow, she's channeling him.

250
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,417
-Like... like Professor X.
-Yeah.

251
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,169
Are you actually believing this crap?

252
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,129
I don't know, I mean...

253
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:47,049
Do you remember when Will
fell off his bike and broke his finger?

254
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,343
He sounded a lot like that.

255
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,471
Did you guys not see what I saw?

256
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,806
They pulled Will's body out of the water.

257
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,433
He's dead!

258
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,230
Well, maybe it's his ghost.
Maybe he's haunting us.

259
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:02,981
-It's not his ghost.
-So how do you know that?

260
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,733
-I just do!
-Then what was in that water?

261
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:05,901
I don't know!

262
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,195
All I know is Will is alive.

263
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,738
Will is alive!

264
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,156
He's out there somewhere.

265
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,866
All we have to do is find him.

266
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:20,999
This isn't gonna work.

267
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,960
We need to get El to a stronger radio.

268
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,046
-Mr. Clarke's Heathkit ham shack.
-Yeah.

269
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,172
The Heathkit's at school.

270
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:31,510
There is no way we're gonna get the weirdo
in there without anyone noticing.

271
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,471
I mean... look at her.

272
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,559
Wow.

273
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,686
-She looks--
-Pretty.

274
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,106
Good.

275
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:27,482
You look pretty good.

276
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,000
Pretty.

277
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:47,961
Good.

278
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:33,840
Clear.

279
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:40,472
-You boys hear me all right in there?
-Loud and clear, Shepard.

280
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,266
Good luck in there, son.

281
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:47,330
"The brown current ran swiftly
out of the heart of darkness,

282
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,416
bearing us down towards the sea

283
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,252
with twice the speed
of our upward progress.

284
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,006
And Kurtz's life
was running swiftly, too--"

285
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,550
Nancy Wheeler?

286
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,510
If you'll come with me, please?

287
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,935
This argument
you and Barbara had?

288
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,645
What exactly was it about?

289
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,858
It wasn't really an argument.

290
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,819
Barb just wanted to leave.

291
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:20,030
I didn't, so, I...

292
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,658
I told her to just go home.

293
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:25,869
Then what?

294
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:30,665
Then I went upstairs
to put on some dry clothes.

295
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:33,627
And the next day, you went back and...

296
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,128
saw a bear, you're thinking?

297
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:39,841
I don't know what it was, but...

298
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:41,134
I think...

299
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,222
I think maybe it took Barb.

300
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,599
-You need to check behind Steve's house--
-We did.

301
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,017
There's nothing there.

302
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,770
-There's no sign of a bear.
-And no car.

303
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:53,021
- What?
- Look.

304
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,357
We figure that Barbara
came back last night

305
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,567
and then she took off,
went somewhere else.

306
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,820
Has she ever talked to you
about running off?

307
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:01,363
Leaving town, maybe?

308
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:02,572
No.

309
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:04,866
No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever.

310
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,328
She wasn't maybe upset about the fact
that you were spending time with this boy?

311
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:10,622
Uh, Steve Harrington?

312
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,332
What? No!

313
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:15,585
Maybe she was jealous
because she saw you go up to Steve's room?

314
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:16,753
It wasn't like that.

315
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:17,963
Like what?

316
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,924
Steve and me, we're... we're just friends.

317
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,759
We... we just talked.

318
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:26,888
Now was this before or after
you changed out of your clothes?

319
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:33,853
So, Gary, tell me
about these troopers that brought in Will.

320
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:36,147
It was about six of 'em, I'd say.

321
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,482
They're all Staties?

322
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:38,567
Yes, sir.

323
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,695
Never seen that many troopers
come with a body before.

324
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:44,573
They told you that they were gonna
take care of the autopsy, huh?

325
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:46,575
Yeah. Claimed jurisdiction.
Kicked me out.

326
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:49,661
Well, it all seemed a bit over the top
to me, considering...

327
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,580
Considering what?

328
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:54,791
Considering this was Will Byers
and not John F. Kennedy.

329
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:05,427
-Thanks for stopping by, Gary.
-Sure thing.

330
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,054
...let the people know that, uh,
the troopers are on duty

331
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:11,683
and you should be safe, because we think
this is just an isolated incident.

332
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:14,269
State trooper David O'Bannon,
thank you so much for your help.

333
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:15,937
- Thank you, sir.
- Back to you...

334
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,836
Okay, remember,
if anyone sees us, look sad.

335
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,588
Attention students,

336
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:46,343
there will be an assembly to honor
Will Byers in the gymnasium now.

337
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,261
Do not go to fourth period.

338
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:49,512
It's locked.

339
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:51,765
-What?
-Hey, do you think you can open it?

340
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:53,558
With your powers?

341
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,101
Boys?

342
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,186
Hey.

343
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:57,771
Assembly's about to start.

344
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:00,607
We know.
We're just, you know...

345
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,484
Upset.

346
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:03,860
Yeah, definitely upset.

347
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,403
We need some alone time.

348
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,656
- To cry.
- Yeah, listen...

349
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:08,990
I get it. I do.

350
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:12,077
I know how hard this is,
but let's just be there for Will, huh?

351
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:13,578
And then...

352
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,583
the Heathkit is all yours
for the rest of the day.

353
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,085
What do you say?

354
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:22,671
I don't believe we've met.
What's your name?

355
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,424
-Eleven--
-Eleanor! She's my, uh--

356
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:27,592
-Cousin.
-Second cousin.

357
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:29,886
She's here for Will's funeral.

358
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,222
Ah, well, welcome to Hawkins Middle,
Eleanor.

359
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,349
I wish you were here
under better circumstances.

360
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:35,475
Thank you.

361
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,144
Uh, where are you from exactly?

362
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:40,605
Bad place--

363
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:42,399
-Sweden!
-I have a lot of Swedish family.

364
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,900
- She hates it there.
- Cold!

365
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,569
Subzero.

366
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,114
-Shall we?
-Yep!

367
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:51,908
At times like these...

368
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:55,829
it is important that we come together
as a community.

369
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:58,123
- We come--

370
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:02,627
Abort.

371
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:07,215
We come together to heal...

372
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:09,843
we come together to grieve...

373
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,888
-You lied to the police!
-I didn't lie!

374
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,224
How naive do you think I am?

375
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,435
You and Steve were just talking?

376
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:19,769
We slept together!

377
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:22,105
Is that what you want to know?
It doesn't matter!

378
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:25,525
-It does matter!
-No! It is all bullshit!

379
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,819
It has nothing to do with Barb
and she's missing.

380
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,779
And something terrible
happened to her. I know it.

381
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,781
I know it!

382
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,908
And no one is listening to me!

383
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:35,535
Sweetie, sweetie, I'm listening.

384
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:38,329
-I'm listening to you--
-No! You're not!

385
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:40,415
Nancy... Nancy!

386
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,208
Just leave me alone!

387
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:19,848
Try him again.

388
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,559
Shepard, come in.
Confirm comm.

389
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:27,230
Shepard, come in.
Confirm comm.

390
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:31,651
This is Shepard.
Confirming, over.

391
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:34,529
Shepard.
Where are you?

392
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:38,032
Can you describe to us
what it is you see? Over.

393
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:40,493
I...
I can't make out my location.

394
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:42,287
It's hard to see.

395
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,084
Shepard? Do you copy?

396
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:52,338
Shepard?
Can you hear me?

397
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:55,049
There's something else...
There's something else in here!

398
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,928
--Reel him in.

399
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:02,056
- Reel him back in!
- Get him in.

400
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,516
Come on, come on!
Faster!

401
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,101
There's something else in here!

402
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,228
Pull me out!
Pull me out, pull me out!

403
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:09,522
- Pull me out! Pull me out!

404
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:33,087
- Shepard, come in. Over.
- Comms are down, sir.

405
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:34,756
Shepard, come in!
Over.

406
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:08,122
Will Byers' death
is an unimaginable tragedy.

407
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:13,670
Will was an exceptional student
and a wonderful friend to all of us.

408
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:19,259
It's impossible to express the hole
his loss will leave in our community.

409
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:22,637
I'd like to introduce you to Sandy Sloane.

410
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,390
She's a local grief counselor
from the church over in Jonesboro.

411
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:28,101
But before she comes up here,

412
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:32,355
I just want those of you who are having
trouble dealing with this tragic loss...

413
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:33,606
Look at these fakers.

414
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:36,442
They probably didn't even know
his name till today.

415
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:38,152
--What?

416
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:40,947
Who is interested in this?
This is so stupid.

417
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,491
- Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

418
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:45,743
Oh,
he was such a great student.

419
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:50,123
Oh, he's going to leave
a hole in the community.

420
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:51,791
Mouth breather.

421
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,976
Hey! Hey!

422
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,311
Hey, Troy!

423
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:12,562
Hey, Troy!

424
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:16,607
You... you think this is funny?

425
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:18,109
What'd you say, Wheeler?

426
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,737
I saw you guys
laughing over there.

427
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,947
And I think that's
a real messed up thing to do.

428
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:25,074
Didn't you listen to the counselor,
Wheeler?

429
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:26,784
Grief shows itself in funny ways.

430
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:30,872
Besides, what's there to be
sad about, anyway?

431
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:32,915
Will's in fairyland now, right?

432
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:35,960
Flying around
with all the other little fairies.

433
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:37,545
All happy and gay!

434
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:53,144
You're dead, Wheeler!

435
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:54,937
Dead!

436
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:07,658
Dude, Troy peed himself.

437
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,502
Holy shit!

438
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:24,092
Hey! What's going on here?

439
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:25,259
Oh.

440
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:27,428
Mike! Let's go!

441
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:39,482
It's made of soft wood
with a crepe interior.

442
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:43,986
Uh, now, I...
I don't know what your budget is,

443
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,740
but over here, we...
we have copper and bronze.

444
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:56,457
Can you just give me a second?

445
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:57,583
Of course.

446
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:03,631
Hey.

447
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:05,425
Hey.

448
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:09,971
Your mom, um... she said you'd be here.

449
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:13,599
I just...

450
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:18,146
Can we talk for a second?

451
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:23,401
It looks like it could be
some kind of perspective distortion,

452
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:25,528
but I wasn't using the wide angle.

453
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:28,156
I don't know.

454
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,449
It's weird.

455
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:35,163
And you're sure you didn't see
anyone else out there?

456
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:37,039
No.

457
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:39,584
And she was there one second
and then, um...

458
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:42,211
gone.

459
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:43,921
I figured she bolted.

460
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:46,340
The cops think that she ran away.

461
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:50,344
But they don't know Barb.

462
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:53,014
And I went back to Steve's...

463
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:56,767
and I thought I...

464
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,644
saw something.

465
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:00,021
Some...

466
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:03,274
weird man or...

467
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,777
I don't know what it was.

468
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,159
I'm sorry.

469
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:17,163
I... I shouldn't have come
here today. I'm...

470
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,081
I'm so sorry.

471
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:20,541
What'd he look like?

472
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:24,253
What?

473
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:26,589
This man you saw in the woods.

474
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:28,633
What'd he look like?

475
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:32,637
I don't know.

476
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:37,433
It was almost like he...

477
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:38,559
he didn't have--

478
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:40,478
Didn't have a face?

479
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,565
How did you know that?

480
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:00,248
Aw, come on!

481
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:03,668
Another, please.

482
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,711
And another for my, uh, friend here.

483
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,756
Oh, thanks, man.
Appreciate it.

484
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:11,425
Yeah, that's all right.
I'm, uh... I'm celebrating.

485
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:14,387
My daughter,
she won the spelling bee today.

486
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:16,722
Is that right?

487
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,307
Yeah, that's right.

488
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,686
"Odontalgia."

489
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:23,646
That was the word.

490
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,565
You know what it means?

491
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:28,109
It's a fancy name for a toothache.

492
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:34,073
Yeah, she's smart. She's real smart.
Don't know where she gets it from.

493
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:36,450
I've been tryin'
to figure that out for years.

494
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,245
Your daughter, she got a name?

495
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:44,125
What?

496
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,752
Your daughter?
What's her name?

497
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:49,505
Sarah.

498
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,008
Her name's Sarah.

499
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:55,511
To Sarah.

500
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:07,690
I recognize you.

501
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,025
Are you famous or somethin'?

502
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:13,404
Uh, you might have seen me on TV, I, uh...
I found that Byers boy.

503
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:17,575
So, you on that case or what?

504
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:19,327
I just saw him on patrol, you know?

505
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,536
Dumb luck.

506
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:24,415
So that quarry, that's, uh...

507
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:26,917
that's state-run,
where they found the boy, huh?

508
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:29,337
Yeah.

509
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,718
Yeah, well, that's funny.

510
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:39,055
'Cause, you know, I know for a fact
that it's run by the Sattler Company.

511
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:42,975
Frank Sattler? Decent guy, still got
a couple operational quarries up in Roane.

512
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:44,435
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

513
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:46,562
That's right.

514
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:49,815
So why are you lying to me, man?

515
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:54,236
What's your problem, bud?

516
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,946
I don't have a problem.

517
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,491
I'm just a concerned citizen.

518
00:35:58,574 --> 00:35:59,742
Yeah?

519
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:02,495
Well, stick your nose someplace else.

520
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:03,871
The kid is dead.

521
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:05,122
End of story.

522
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,086
Thanks for ruining the game, dick.

523
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:19,637
Okay...

524
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,681
- Let's try this one more time.

525
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:23,766
Who told you to be out there?

526
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,601
What were you doing out there?

527
00:36:26,686 --> 00:36:29,105
I don't know!
I don't know. They...

528
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:33,442
they just told me to call it in
and not let anybody get too close.

529
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:35,152
Get close to what?

530
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,487
The body.

531
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:39,156
Who do you work for?

532
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,701
The NSA? Hawkins Lab?

533
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,620
- Who is that?

534
00:36:44,704 --> 00:36:46,580
-You're gonna get us both killed.
-Who is that?

535
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:49,083
Hey! Hey!

536
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,688
Come on!
Come on!

537
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:14,525
Talk to me!

538
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:16,902
I know you're here!

539
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:21,782
Come on.

540
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,789
-Now what?
-She'll find him.

541
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:29,999
Right, El?

542
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,137
Eleven?

543
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:46,766
Are you listening?

544
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,645
That man before you...

545
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:57,401
I need you to find him.

546
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:05,159
- Hurt him?
- No.

547
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,828
No, I don't want you to hurt him.

548
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:11,457
I want you to listen to him.

549
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:16,837
-Listen?
-Yes.

550
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:22,343
I want you to listen to what he says
and repeat his words back to me.

551
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:26,931
Just like we used to
with those old nursery rhymes.

552
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:28,432
Do you remember?

553
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:31,185
Hmm?

554
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,395
Do you think you can do that for me?

555
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:37,149
-Mmm-hmm.
-Good.

556
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,085
Begin.

557
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,003
Amulet.

558
00:38:58,921 --> 00:38:59,922
Frigid.

559
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:01,882
Evolve.

560
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:04,051
Airplane.

561
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:06,303
Eleven?

562
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:09,056
Repeat the words.

563
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:15,813
Apricot.

564
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:17,982
Peninsula.

565
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:19,817
Game.

566
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,360
Enchantment.

567
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:23,445
Mouse.

568
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:25,781
Balloon.

569
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,616
She's doing it.

570
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,410
-She's finding him!
-This is crazy.

571
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,287
Calm down.
She just closed her eyes.

572
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,707
- Holy...

573
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,841
What is that?

574
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:02,776
Mom?

575
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,778
Will?

576
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:06,280
Mom?

577
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:08,657
No way!

578
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:10,534
- Mom...
- Will!

579
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:11,660
Please...

580
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:13,078
Will!

581
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:15,080
Will!

582
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,208
Will...

583
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:20,669
Will!

584
00:40:20,753 --> 00:40:22,087
- Mom!
- Will!

585
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:24,590
I'm here! I'm here!

586
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:25,883
- Oh, God...
- Mom!

587
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,927
-Will!
-Will, it's us! Are you there?

588
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,386
Can you hear us?
We're here!

589
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,472
Hello? Mom?

590
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:32,598
Why can't he hear us?

591
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:33,891
I don't know!

592
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:36,769
Baby...

593
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:39,647
-Mom?
-Oh, God. Will!

594
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,731
Mom!

595
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:42,775
Oh, thank God.

596
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,652
Baby...

597
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:45,778
Will...

598
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:47,988
--Mom...

599
00:40:48,072 --> 00:40:49,406
Mom, it's coming!

600
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,700
Tell me where you are!
How do I get to you?

601
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:54,286
It's like home,
but it's so dark...

602
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:58,248
It's so dark and empty.
And it's cold!

603
00:40:58,332 --> 00:40:59,541
Mom? Mom!

604
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:02,920
Listen to me!
I swear I'm gonna get to you, okay?

605
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:04,838
But right now, I need you to hide.

606
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:06,298
Mom, please!

607
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:08,968
- No, no, listen! Listen, I...

608
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:12,012
I will find you, but you have to run now!

609
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:14,431
- Run! Run!

610
00:41:40,374 --> 00:41:41,583
- El, are you okay?
- Oh!

611
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:44,712
Can you move?

612
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:49,133
Here, help her up.

613
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:25,294
--This way!

614
00:42:31,842 --> 00:42:33,260
And you're...

615
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,679
Brightening.
Enlarging.

616
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:36,889
Hmm.

617
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:42,019
- Did your mom say anything else?

618
00:42:42,102 --> 00:42:46,148
Like, um,
where it might have gone to, or...

619
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:49,651
- No, just that it came out of the wall.

620
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:58,035
How long does this take?

621
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,204
Not long.

622
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:05,084
Have you been...

623
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:07,002
doing this a while?

624
00:43:07,086 --> 00:43:08,670
What?

625
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:10,005
Photography?

626
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:12,716
Yeah.

627
00:43:13,634 --> 00:43:17,805
I guess I'd rather observe
people than, you know...

628
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:19,932
Talk to them.

629
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:21,975
I know.
It's weird.

630
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:23,060
No!

631
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:25,270
No, it is.

632
00:43:25,354 --> 00:43:26,855
It's just, sometimes...

633
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:30,567
people don't really say
what they're really thinking.

634
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:33,403
But you capture the right moment...

635
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:35,656
it says more.

636
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:37,116
What was I saying?

637
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:39,743
What?

638
00:43:39,827 --> 00:43:41,120
When you took my picture.

639
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:44,456
I shouldn't have taken that.

640
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:47,668
I'm, uh...

641
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:49,294
I'm sorry.

642
00:43:51,213 --> 00:43:52,673
It's just--

643
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:54,299
That's it.

644
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:57,344
That's what I saw.

645
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:01,807
My mom...

646
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,851
I thought she was crazy

647
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:05,686
'cause she said...

648
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:08,522
that's not Will's body.
That he's alive.

649
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:11,275
-And if he's alive--
-Then Barbara.

650
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,337
-Hey, Patty!
-Hey, uh, need something, Chief?

651
00:44:32,421 --> 00:44:34,923
-Oh, you know, I forgot my hat.
-Oh.

652
00:44:35,007 --> 00:44:36,717
I'll just be a minute.

653
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:44,892
Hey, I love that book.
It's a nasty mutt.

654
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:46,018
Hey, you can't be back here.

655
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:47,686
Yeah, I just got off the line
with O'Bannon.

656
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:49,730
He said that he needs
to see you at the station.

657
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:51,899
-It's some emergency...
-What the hell are you talking about?

658
00:44:51,982 --> 00:44:53,108
I don't work with O'Bannon.

659
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,985
Did I say O'Bannon? I meant...

660
00:44:57,279 --> 00:44:58,989
Okay.

661
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:22,799
Babe...

662
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:24,217
Jesus, the hell happened?

663
00:47:26,762 --> 00:47:27,929
Lonnie.
