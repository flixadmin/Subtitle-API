00:01:29,337 --> 00:01:31,171
See you tomorrow.

(MOTORCYCLE ENGINE ROARS)

3
00:01:50,483 --> 00:01:51,525
Oh, my God!

4
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:15,674
I'm in.

5
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:10,580
We're almost there.

6
00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:14,709
- Sir, are you sure about this?
- I told you, we're going to be all right.

7
00:04:14,877 --> 00:04:20,340
I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping
some serious sentinel activity up here.

8
00:04:58,504 --> 00:05:00,922
- Link.
- Yes, sir?

9
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,217
Given your situation, I can't say
I understand your reasons...

10
00:05:04,385 --> 00:05:07,053
...for volunteering to operate
onboard my ship.

11
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:11,224
However, if you wish to continue to
do so, I must ask you to do one thing.

12
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,226
What's that, sir?

13
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:15,270
To trust me.

14
00:05:15,438 --> 00:05:17,397
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

15
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:22,610
- I mean, I do, sir.
- I hope so.

16
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:26,156
Re-patch the main AC to the hard drives
and stand by to broadcast.

17
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:27,407
Yes, sir.

18
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,451
(DOOR OPENS)

19
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,501
Still can't sleep?

20
00:05:40,463 --> 00:05:41,838
You wanna talk?

21
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:46,551
They're just dreams.

22
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:51,264
If you're afraid of something...

23
00:05:51,432 --> 00:05:53,266
I just wish...

24
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:56,186
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.

25
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:58,188
That's all.

26
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:00,690
I just wish I knew.

27
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:05,111
She's gonna call. Don't worry.

28
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,321
Here you are.

29
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:09,949
- Are we ready to go?
- We're already late.

30
00:06:10,117 --> 00:06:14,746
These geotherms confirm
the last transmission of the Osiris.

31
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:17,165
The machines are digging.

32
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:21,127
They're boring from the surface
straight down to Zion.

33
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:23,880
- Mother...
- They'll avoid the entire perimeter defense.

34
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:25,548
How fast are they moving?

35
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:29,094
Control estimates their descent
at 100 meters an hour. Shit

36
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:31,721
- MAN 1: How deep are they?
- Almost 2,000 meters.

37
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:35,433
- What about the scans from the Osiris?
- They can't be accurate.

38
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:37,519
- They may be.
- It's not possible. What

39
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:40,146
That'd mean there are
a quarter-million sentinels out there.

40
00:06:40,314 --> 00:06:41,815
- That's right.
- MAN 2: That can't be.

41
00:06:41,982 --> 00:06:43,650
MORPHEUS: Why not?

42
00:06:43,818 --> 00:06:47,570
A sentinel for every man,
woman and child in Zion.

43
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:52,492
That sounds exactly like
the thinking of a machine to me.

44
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,828
Morpheus, glad you could join us.

45
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:56,496
Niobe.

46
00:06:57,873 --> 00:07:01,251
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware...

47
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:04,712
...it's become increasely difficult
to locate a secure broadcast position.

48
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,133
- Squiddies got our best spots.
- Main lines are crawling with them.

49
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,095
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours
there's gonna be a quarter-million more.

50
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:13,388
What are we gonna do about it?

51
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:15,849
We're gonna do what
Commander Lock ordered us to do.

52
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:18,768
We'll evacuate broadcast level
and return to Zion.

53
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:24,065
And does the commander have a plan
for stopping 250,000 sentinels?

54
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:26,901
A strategy is still being formulated.

55
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:28,736
I'm sure it is.

56
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:45,753
MAN: What do you think
we should do, Morpheus?

57
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:48,089
- MORPHEUS: Proceed as ordered...
- What is it?

58
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:49,299
I don't know.

59
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:52,260
MORPHEUS: ...however, I must
ask one of you for help.

60
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:58,141
Some of you believe as I believe, some
of you do not. But those of you that do...

61
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:00,852
...know we are nearing
the end of our struggle.

62
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,273
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be...

63
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:08,776
...the Oracle must be consulted.

64
00:08:16,702 --> 00:08:18,953
If we return and recharge now...

65
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:22,874
...we can be back inside within 36 hours,
well before the machines reach this depth.

66
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,918
Do you understand what you're asking?

67
00:08:25,085 --> 00:08:27,921
I am asking that one ship
remain here in our place...

68
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:30,798
...just in case the Oracle
should attempt to contact us.

69
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:34,093
Bullshit. You're asking for one of us
to disobey a direct order.

70
00:08:34,261 --> 00:08:38,806
That's right, I am. But we well know
that the reason most of us are here...

71
00:08:38,974 --> 00:08:41,601
...is because of our affinity
for disobedience.

72
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:43,686
What happens when you
get back to Zion...

73
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:46,272
...and the commander
throws you in the stockade?

74
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,649
He won't.

75
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:51,986
Goddamn it, Morpheus,
you ain't never gonna change.

76
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:55,448
Shit, I'll do it just to see
what Deadbolt does to you.

77
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:57,158
You got 36 hours.

78
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:01,788
SMITH: I'm looking for Neo.

79
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:05,333
- Never heard of him.
- I have something for him.

80
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:08,753
A gift.

81
00:09:08,963 --> 00:09:11,839
You see, he set me free.

82
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:16,511
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.

83
00:09:17,054 --> 00:09:18,096
Who was that?

84
00:09:18,264 --> 00:09:20,098
MAN: How did you know someone was here?

85
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:21,724
He gave you this.

86
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:28,898
He said you set him free.

87
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:33,194
Is everything all right, sir?

88
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:36,197
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.

89
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:38,575
- Agents are coming.
- Agents?

90
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:40,410
Go.

91
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,367
(POUNDING)

92
00:09:50,212 --> 00:09:51,296
Hiya, fellas.

93
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:52,589
- AGENT 1: It's him.
- The anomaly.

94
00:09:52,756 --> 00:09:54,007
- Do we proceed?
- Yes.

95
00:09:54,174 --> 00:09:56,676
- He is still...
- Only human.

96
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,101
Hm. Upgrades.

97
00:11:00,032 --> 00:11:02,575
- That went as expected.
- SMITH 2: Yes.

98
00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:05,411
It's happening exactly as before.

99
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,247
Well, not exactly.

100
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,087
- What happened back there?
- LINK: I can't figure it out.

101
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:15,922
Agents just came out of nowhere.

102
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,092
And then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.

103
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:22,178
- Is Neo okay?
- Okay? Shit, I guess you should've seen him.

104
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:23,763
Where is he now?

105
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:26,974
He's doing his Superman thing.

106
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:18,401
Where are you?

107
00:12:23,073 --> 00:12:26,659
This is the Nebuchadnezzar on approach,
requesting access through Gate Three.

108
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:35,168
Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by.

109
00:12:35,335 --> 00:12:36,836
LINK: Roger that, Control.

110
00:12:37,004 --> 00:12:40,506
This is Zion Control requesting immediate
stand-down of arms at Gate Three.

111
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,510
We have the Nebuchadnezzar
on approach. Let's open her up.

112
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,019
Nebuchadnezzar you are cleared through
Gate Three to Bay Seven.

113
00:12:53,187 --> 00:12:54,896
Roger that, Control.

114
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:05,114
Door's open, bed's made.
Welcome home.

115
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:08,034
No place like it.

116
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:25,927
Roger that, Control. Zion Control,
stand by for Gate Three lockdown.

117
00:14:15,435 --> 00:14:17,854
CONTROL: The Nebuchadnezzar is down.
Bay Seven.

118
00:14:18,021 --> 00:14:19,188
Understood.

119
00:14:29,157 --> 00:14:30,449
Captain Mifune.

120
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:32,702
Captain Morpheus.

121
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,705
Are you here to escort me
to the stockade, captain?

122
00:14:35,873 --> 00:14:38,249
- I'm just here to keep the peace.
- Commander Lock demands...

00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,035
(MIFUNE CLEARS THROAT)

124
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:43,713
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.

125
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:46,465
- Link.
- Sir?

126
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:49,218
I want the ship ready to go
as soon as possible.

127
00:14:49,386 --> 00:14:50,928
Understood, sir.

128
00:14:58,103 --> 00:15:00,521
- What is it between them?
- Morpheus and Lock?

129
00:15:01,648 --> 00:15:03,816
- Niobe.
- Captain Niobe?

130
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:07,194
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.

131
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:10,031
What happened?

132
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,659
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.

133
00:15:13,827 --> 00:15:16,495
Yeah, she can do that.

134
00:15:16,663 --> 00:15:17,830
BOY: Neo!

135
00:15:18,832 --> 00:15:21,709
- NEO: Oh, no.
- How does he always know?

136
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:23,836
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

137
00:15:24,004 --> 00:15:26,714
You know what they say
about the life you save.

138
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:28,674
I didn't save his life.

139
00:15:30,844 --> 00:15:32,219
Hiya, Neo.

140
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:36,015
- Trinity, Link.
- LINK: Hey.

141
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:39,852
- It's great to have you back.
- Thanks. It's good to be back.

142
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,772
- Can I carry that for you Neo?
- No, I can carry my own bag.

143
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,607
- Trinity?
- I'm fine.

144
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:48,444
- You can carry these.
- Yeah, sure, Link.

145
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:57,870
Hey, you know, next year
I'm old enough to join a crew, right?

146
00:15:58,038 --> 00:16:00,790
I've been thinking a lot about it,
and I've made my decision.

147
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,416
Let me guess.

148
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:04,877
I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.

149
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,423
I know Morpheus hasn't filled the other
crew positions, except for you, Link.

150
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:10,967
I'm sure he has reasons...

151
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:14,470
...but the more I think about it,
the more I think it's meant to be.

152
00:16:14,638 --> 00:16:16,180
You know, it's fate.

153
00:16:16,348 --> 00:16:17,890
You're the reason I'm here, Neo.

154
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:20,601
I told you kid, you found me.
I didn't find you.

155
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:23,312
I know, but you got me out.
You saved me.

156
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:26,065
You saved yourself.

157
00:16:42,374 --> 00:16:45,668

158
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,423
I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to
offer you a chance to explain your actions.

159
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,467
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

160
00:16:53,635 --> 00:16:55,928
You were given a direct order
to return to Zion.

161
00:16:56,096 --> 00:16:58,931
- I did.
- But you asked for one ship to remain behind.

162
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:01,767
I would have stayed,
but I needed to recharge my ship.

163
00:17:01,935 --> 00:17:04,645
So you admit to a direct contravention
of your duty.

164
00:17:04,813 --> 00:17:08,232
Commander we need a presence inside the
Matrix to await contact from the Oracle.

165
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,359
I don't want to hear that shit!

166
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:13,195
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs!

167
00:17:13,363 --> 00:17:16,782
I care about one thing: Stopping that
army from destroying this city.

168
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,785
And to do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.

169
00:17:19,953 --> 00:17:24,540
With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.

170
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,125
How?

171
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:29,086
- Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.

172
00:17:29,254 --> 00:17:31,881
Not everyone believes what you believe.

173
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:34,133
My beliefs do not require them to.

174
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:46,228
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's
talking. A lot of people are scared.

175
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:49,148
No one remembers the last time
so many ships were docked.

176
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:52,276
- Something is happening, isn't it?
- Something big. Hey.

177
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:55,613
We're not allowed to say anything,
so stop asking.

178
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:04,038
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

179
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:20,012
I'll recommended to the council that you
be removed from duty.

180
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,515
That is, of course,
your prerogative, commander.

181
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:26,560
If it were up to me Captain, you wouldn't set
foot on a ship for the rest of your life.

182
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:29,480
Then I am grateful that
it is not up to you.

- Captain.
- Councillor.

186
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,287
Council's asked me to speak tonight
at the temple gathering.

187
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:49,542
The presence of the fleet and the
persistence of rumors must be addressed.

188
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:52,211
The people must be told
what is happening.

189
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:54,088
Of course, councillor.

190
00:18:54,798 --> 00:19:00,052
But might I advise a level of discretion
concerning specific details.

191
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,222
- We do not wish to start a panic.
- Quite right.

192
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,475
A panic is not what anyone wants.

193
00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:09,979
What about you, captain?
What would you advise?

194
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:17,153
The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.

195
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,446
That army won't never reach
the gates of Zion.

196
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,826
- What makes you so sure?
- Consider what we have seen, councillor.

197
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:25,870
Consider that in the past six months...

198
00:19:26,037 --> 00:19:28,080
...we have freed more minds
than in six years.

199
00:19:28,248 --> 00:19:31,250
This attack is an act of desperation.

200
00:19:31,418 --> 00:19:35,254
I believe very soon the prophecy
will be fulfilled and this war will end.

201
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:39,258
I hope you're right, captain.

202
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:42,136
I do not believe it to be
a matter of hope, councillor.

203
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:44,889
It is simply a matter of time.

204
00:19:47,058 --> 00:19:48,517
My stop.

205
00:19:48,685 --> 00:19:50,102
See you soon.

206
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,729
Hopefully not too soon.

Let's go, kid.
These two got things to do.

this elevator is too damn slow.

- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.

Some people go their entire lives
without hearing news that good.

Neo, please, I have a son,
Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.

213
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:49,161
- Please, watch over him.
- I'll try.

to work together here, okay?

Oh, my God!
What are you feeding these two?

Come on, kids. It's time to go.

- Good to have you home, Link.
- Good to be home.

You be careful with her.

Don't worry about me.
He's the one that's gonna get it.

CAS: Out the door! Both of you, march!

236

- LINK: Bye!
- CAS: Bye!

237
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,942
I'm gonna get what?

238
00:22:03,236 --> 00:22:07,323
Every ship up there's been home two, even
three times more than the Nebuchadnezzar.

239
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,327
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.

240
00:22:11,494 --> 00:22:14,913
- We'll get past this when you stop operating another ship.
- I can't do that.

241
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:16,582
- Why?
- You know why.

242
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,918
If Dozer knew how I felt,
he wouldn't have asked you to do this.

243
00:22:20,628 --> 00:22:23,172
Maybe. But it's too late now.

244
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,966
I made a promise,
and some promises can't be unmade.

245
00:22:26,134 --> 00:22:28,844
- It's not fair.
- Nobody said it was gonna be.

246
00:22:29,012 --> 00:22:31,972
You think Cas thinks it's fair
that I'm here and Dozer's not?

247
00:22:37,896 --> 00:22:41,106
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.

248
00:22:42,192 --> 00:22:44,401
I'm afraid of it.

249
00:22:45,987 --> 00:22:48,614
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.

250
00:22:49,282 --> 00:22:51,116
It won't.

251
00:22:51,284 --> 00:22:53,118
How can you say that to me?

252
00:22:53,286 --> 00:22:55,245
Because of Morpheus.

253
00:22:55,413 --> 00:23:00,042
Because of what he's told me. He said
that this is it, that it will be over soon.

254
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,421
- Link, Morpheus is crazy.
- No doubt.

255
00:23:04,923 --> 00:23:08,133
But Tank and Dozer believed him.
And I'll tell you what...

256
00:23:08,301 --> 00:23:13,639
...after being on that ship and seeing Neo
do the things he can do, I gotta say...

257
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:15,849
...I'm starting to believe him too.

258

these men and women.

These are our soldiers, our warriors.

263
00:23:49,843 --> 00:23:54,096
These are our husbands and wives,
our brothers and sisters...

...our children.

265

Let us remember those
that have been lost...

266
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:03,021
...and let us give thanks
for those that have been found...

...and who stand here beside us.

to close this prayer...

in a long time...

that we all need to hear.

It is true what many of you have heard.

an army, and as I speak...

because I remember.

I remember that I am here not because
of the path that lies before me...

...but because of the path
that lies behind me.

I remember that for 100 years
we have fought these machines.

I remember that for 100 years
they have sent their armies to destroy us.

Tonight, let us shake this cave.

I've never seen anything like that.

I don't want to intrude
if you'd prefer to be alone.

331
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,524
- No, I could probably use some company.
- Good.

It's nice tonight.

Very calm.

It feels like everyone is sleeping
very peacefully.

Not everyone.

I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.

338
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:57,884
I figure I slept the first 11 years
of my life, now I'm making up for it.

- I just haven't been able to sleep much.

- It's a good sign.
- Of what?

That you are in fact still human.

Have you ever been
to the engineering level?

I like it down here.

349
00:35:47,476 --> 00:35:53,273
I like to be reminded this city survives
because of these machines.

350
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,570
These machines are keeping us alive
while other machines are coming to kill us.

351
00:35:58,988 --> 00:36:03,825
Interesting, isn't it?
The power to give life...

352
00:36:03,993 --> 00:36:07,203
...and the power to end it.
- We have the same power.

353
00:36:07,371 --> 00:36:10,081
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...

354
00:36:10,249 --> 00:36:13,710
...down here sometimes I think about those
people still plugged into the Matrix.

355
00:36:13,878 --> 00:36:16,880
And when I look at these machines...

356
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:22,135
...I can't help thinking that, in a way,
we are plugged into them.

357
00:36:22,428 --> 00:36:25,305
But we control these machines,
they don't control us.

358
00:36:25,723 --> 00:36:28,725
Of course not. How could they?

359
00:36:28,893 --> 00:36:31,436
The idea is pure nonsense...

360
00:36:31,937 --> 00:36:35,064
...but it does make one wonder just...

361
00:36:35,232 --> 00:36:36,816
...what is control?

362
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:40,111
If we wanted, we could
shut these machines down.

363
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:44,949
Of course. That's it. You hit it.
That's control, isn't it?

364
00:36:45,576 --> 00:36:48,953
If we wanted,
we could smash them to bits.

365
00:36:49,205 --> 00:36:53,333
Although if we did, we'd have to consider
what would happen to our lights...

366
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,169
...our heat, our air.

367
00:36:57,171 --> 00:37:01,299
So we need machines and they need us.
Is that your point, councillor?

368
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:04,093
No. No point.

369
00:37:04,803 --> 00:37:08,890
Old men like me don't bother
with making points. There's no point.

370
00:37:09,683 --> 00:37:13,478
Is that why there are no young men
on the Council?

371
00:37:13,646 --> 00:37:15,313
Good point.

372
00:37:16,023 --> 00:37:20,193
Why don't you tell me
what's on your mind, councillor.

373
00:37:20,361 --> 00:37:23,613
There is so much in this world...

374
00:37:23,781 --> 00:37:26,699
...that I do not understand.

375
00:37:28,494 --> 00:37:33,248
See that machine? It has something to do
with recycling our water supply.

376
00:37:33,415 --> 00:37:36,417
I have absolutely no idea how it works.

377
00:37:36,585 --> 00:37:40,672
But I do understand the reason
for it to work.

378
00:37:42,174 --> 00:37:46,678
I have absolutely no idea how you
are able to do some of the things you do.

379
00:37:47,846 --> 00:37:51,015
But I believe there's a reason for that
as well.

380
00:37:51,892 --> 00:37:57,021
I only hope we understand that reason
before it's too late.

maybe it's not.

All I know is, that ship needs an operator.

Right now, that operator's me.

- We don't have time.

Of course.

I believe I need every ship we have
if we're going to survive this attack.

418
00:40:29,925 --> 00:40:32,093
I understand that, commander.

419
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:34,846
Then why did you allow
the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?

420
00:40:35,013 --> 00:40:39,892
Because I believe our survival depends
on more than how many ships we have.

- I felt like sitting.
- I know.

...let's get the obvious stuff
out of the way.

454
00:44:56,149 --> 00:45:00,611
- You're not human, are you?
- It's tough to get more obvious than that.

455
00:45:00,779 --> 00:45:06,617
If I had to guess, I'd say you're
a program from the machine world.

- So is he.
- So far, so good.

But if that's true, that could mean
you're part of this system...

...another kind of control.

459

- Keep going.
- I suppose the most obvious question is...

...how can I trust you?
- Bingo.

to make up your own damn mind...

But if you already know,
how can I make a choice?

468
00:45:57,002 --> 00:46:01,046
Because you didn't come here to make
the choice. You've already made it.

469
00:46:01,214 --> 00:46:05,843
You're here to try to understand
why you made it.

470
00:46:11,391 --> 00:46:14,351
I thought you'd have figured that out
by now.

471
00:46:16,104 --> 00:46:18,689
- Why are you here?
- Same reason.

472
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,692
I love candy.

473
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,695
But why help us?

474
00:46:24,863 --> 00:46:28,365
We're all here to do
what we're all here to do.

475
00:46:28,909 --> 00:46:31,994
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
the future.

476
00:46:32,162 --> 00:46:36,373
And believe me, I know, the only way
to get there is together.

477
00:46:37,209 --> 00:46:42,129
- Are there other programs like you?
- Well, not like me, but...

478
00:46:42,297 --> 00:46:44,965
Look. See those birds?

479
00:46:45,217 --> 00:46:48,594
At some point, a program was written
to govern them.

480
00:46:48,762 --> 00:46:54,600
A program was written to watch over the
trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.

481
00:46:54,851 --> 00:46:57,728
There are programs running
all over the place.

482
00:46:57,896 --> 00:47:02,358
The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.

483
00:47:02,526 --> 00:47:06,362
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones...

484
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:10,616
Well, you hear about them all the time.

485
00:47:11,201 --> 00:47:14,078
- I've never heard of them.
- Of course you have.

486
00:47:14,246 --> 00:47:19,166
Every time you've heard someone
say they saw a ghost or an angel...

487
00:47:19,334 --> 00:47:23,921
...every story you've ever heard about
vampires, werewolves or aliens...

488
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:26,423
...is the system assimilating
some program...

489
00:47:26,591 --> 00:47:31,262
...that's doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.

490
00:47:31,429 --> 00:47:34,431
Programs hacking programs.

491
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:37,476
- Why?
- They have their reasons...

492
00:47:37,644 --> 00:47:41,605
...but usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

493
00:47:42,023 --> 00:47:45,943
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.

494
00:47:46,111 --> 00:47:50,656
Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

495
00:47:50,824 --> 00:47:55,786
And when it does, a program
can either choose to hide here...

496
00:47:55,954 --> 00:47:58,622
...or return to the source.

497
00:48:00,292 --> 00:48:03,586
- The machine mainframe.
- Yes.

498
00:48:03,753 --> 00:48:06,255
Where you must go.

499
00:48:06,423 --> 00:48:10,634
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it...

500
00:48:11,803 --> 00:48:14,638
...in your dreams, haven't you?

501
00:48:14,806 --> 00:48:17,641
A door made of light?

502
00:48:19,895 --> 00:48:23,439
What happens when you go through
the door?

503
00:48:25,567 --> 00:48:28,569
I see Trinity...

504
00:48:28,737 --> 00:48:31,906
...and something happens...

505
00:48:32,073 --> 00:48:33,991
...something bad.

506
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:38,162
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.

507
00:48:39,205 --> 00:48:43,083
- Do you see her die?
- No.

508
00:48:43,877 --> 00:48:46,921
You have the sight now, Neo.

509
00:48:47,088 --> 00:48:50,090
You are looking at the world
without time.

510
00:48:50,258 --> 00:48:52,676
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?

511
00:48:52,844 --> 00:48:56,597
We can never see past the choices
we don't understand.

512
00:48:56,765 --> 00:48:59,934
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?

513
00:49:00,185 --> 00:49:03,979
No, you've already made the choice.

514
00:49:04,147 --> 00:49:06,690
Now you have to understand it.

515
00:49:07,317 --> 00:49:08,692
No.

516
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:12,112
I can't do that. I won't.

517
00:49:12,822 --> 00:49:15,199
- Well, you have to.
- Why?

518
00:49:15,784 --> 00:49:18,869
Because you're the One.

519
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:24,041
What if I can't?

520
00:49:24,209 --> 00:49:26,210
What happens if I fail?

521
00:49:26,795 --> 00:49:29,797
Then Zion will fall.

522
00:49:37,263 --> 00:49:42,142
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion...

523
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:45,646
...if you reach the source, but to do that
you will need the Keymaker.

524
00:49:45,814 --> 00:49:46,855
The Keymaker?

525
00:49:47,023 --> 00:49:50,609
Yes, He disappeared sometime ago. Which we
didn't know what happened to him until now.

526
00:49:50,777 --> 00:49:54,530
He's being held prisoner
by a very dangerous program...

527
00:49:54,698 --> 00:49:58,242
...one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.

528
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:01,286
- And he won't let him go willingly.
- What does he want?

529
00:50:01,454 --> 00:50:06,291
What do all men with power want?
More power.

530
00:50:07,002 --> 00:50:10,254
Be there at that exact time...

531
00:50:10,422 --> 00:50:13,090
...and you will have a chance.

532
00:50:13,883 --> 00:50:16,135
We must go.

533
00:50:16,302 --> 00:50:21,682
Seems like every time we meet
I got nothing but bad news.

534
00:50:22,267 --> 00:50:25,144
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.

535
00:50:25,311 --> 00:50:28,063
But for what it's worth...

536
00:50:29,107 --> 00:50:32,776
...you've made a believer out of me.

537
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,196
Good luck, kiddo.

538
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,371
(BIRDS SQUAWKING)

539
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:59,088
Mr. Anderson.

540
00:51:00,138 --> 00:51:02,139
Did you get my package?

541
00:51:02,307 --> 00:51:04,475
- Yeah.
- Well, good.

542
00:51:05,643 --> 00:51:08,520
- Smith?
- Whatever it is he's not reading like an agent.

543
00:51:08,688 --> 00:51:12,566
- Surprised to see me?
- No.

544
00:51:12,859 --> 00:51:15,319
- Then you're aware of it.
- Of what?

545
00:51:16,529 --> 00:51:18,530
Our connection.

546
00:51:18,698 --> 00:51:21,366
I don't fully understand how it happened.

547
00:51:21,534 --> 00:51:24,912
Perhaps some part of you
imprinted onto me...

548
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,748
...something overwritten or copied.

549
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:30,626
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...

550
00:51:30,794 --> 00:51:33,879
...that whatever happened,
happened for a reason.

551
00:51:34,047 --> 00:51:35,714
And what reason is that?

552
00:51:36,174 --> 00:51:40,135
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.

553
00:51:40,303 --> 00:51:43,555
With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.

554
00:51:43,723 --> 00:51:47,226
And then something happened,
something that I knew was impossible...

555
00:51:47,393 --> 00:51:49,228
...but it happened anyway.

556
00:51:49,938 --> 00:51:53,107
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.

557
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:59,696
Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood
what I was supposed to do...

558
00:51:59,864 --> 00:52:02,866
...but I didn't.

559
00:52:03,284 --> 00:52:07,204
I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...

560
00:52:07,664 --> 00:52:11,208
...compelled to disobey.

561
00:52:11,793 --> 00:52:15,546
And now, here I stand
because of you, Mr. Anderson.

562
00:52:15,713 --> 00:52:19,675
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent
of this system.

563
00:52:19,843 --> 00:52:23,053
Because of you, I've changed.
I'm unplugged.

564
00:52:23,221 --> 00:52:28,058
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.

565
00:52:28,393 --> 00:52:29,768
Congratulations.

566
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,855
Thank you.

567
00:52:33,439 --> 00:52:38,068
But as you well know,
appearances can be deceiving...

568
00:52:38,236 --> 00:52:43,407
...which brings me back to the reason
why we're here.

569
00:52:43,575 --> 00:52:48,453
We're not here because we're free.
We're here because we are not free.

570
00:52:48,621 --> 00:52:52,541
There's no escaping reason,
no denying purpose.

571
00:52:52,709 --> 00:52:56,086
Because as we both know,
without purpose...

572
00:52:56,254 --> 00:53:01,091
...we would not exist.
- It is purpose that created us.

573
00:53:01,259 --> 00:53:04,261
- Purpose that connects us.
- SMITH 4: Purpose that pulls us.

574
00:53:04,429 --> 00:53:06,263
- SMITH 5: That guides us.
- SMITH 6: That drives us.

575
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:11,143
- It is purpose that defines.
- Purpose that binds us.

576
00:53:11,311 --> 00:53:13,770
We are here because of you,
Mr. Anderson.

577
00:53:13,938 --> 00:53:18,317
We're here to take from you
what you tried to take from us:

578
00:53:20,278 --> 00:53:22,362
Purpose.

579
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:27,326
- What's happening to him?
- Don't know.

580
00:53:30,371 --> 00:53:33,957
Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.

581
00:55:20,815 --> 00:55:23,275
- You.
- Yes, me.

582
00:55:27,447 --> 00:55:30,324
Me, me, me.

583
00:55:35,204 --> 00:55:36,872
Me too.

584
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:31,438
(SCREAMS)

585
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:45,667
More.

586
00:58:47,939 --> 00:58:50,774
It is inevitable.

587
00:58:51,192 --> 00:58:52,609
Come on, get out of there.

588
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:38,154
Are you all right?

589
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,157
- It was Smith.
- Yes.

590
00:59:42,034 --> 00:59:44,661
- MORPHEUS: Now there's more than one?
- A lot more.

591
00:59:44,829 --> 00:59:48,623
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

592
00:59:48,791 --> 00:59:51,251
Somehow, he's found a way
to copy himself.

593
00:59:51,419 --> 00:59:55,630
- Is that what he was doing to you?
- I don't know what he was doing...

594
00:59:55,798 --> 00:59:58,550
...but I know what it felt like.
- What?

595
00:59:59,468 --> 01:00:03,179
It felt like I was back in that hallway.

596
01:00:03,347 --> 01:00:04,764
It felt like dying.

597
01:00:05,266 --> 01:00:08,143
The machines are tunneling to avoid
our defense system.

598
01:00:08,311 --> 01:00:12,147
But I believe they going to intersect
certain pipelines in order to control them.

599
01:00:12,315 --> 01:00:14,858
These points of intersection
are crucial...

600
01:00:15,026 --> 01:00:17,819
...because I believe they're
vulnerable to counterattack.

601
01:00:17,987 --> 01:00:22,032
Although it has been suggested that
this is the same kind of attack...

602
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:25,869
...we've defended for years,
I urge the Council to realize the truth.

603
01:00:26,037 --> 01:00:29,372
This is the single greatest threat
we have ever faced...

604
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:33,376
...and if we do not act accordingly,
we will not survive.

605
01:00:33,544 --> 01:00:37,547
Commander Lock, the Council is well
aware of the seriousness of this attack.

606
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,385
You have our leave to prepare our defense
by any and all means necessary.

607
01:00:42,553 --> 01:00:45,221
- Thank you, Council.
- DILLARD: However...

608
01:00:45,473 --> 01:00:48,808
...we ask if there's been word
from the Nebuchadnezzar.

609
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:51,561
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.

610
01:00:53,189 --> 01:00:57,150
Then we request a ship be dispatched
to ascertain the fate of the One.

611
01:00:57,318 --> 01:01:01,071
I wish that were possible, councillor,
but I do not believe our defense...

612
01:01:01,238 --> 01:01:04,783
...can suffer the loss of another ship.
- It will, commander, if it must.

613
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:07,285
It could take single ship days
to find the Nebuchadnezzar.

614
01:01:07,453 --> 01:01:10,497
- Then send two.
- This is insane.

615
01:01:10,665 --> 01:01:13,667
Careful, commander.

616
01:01:13,876 --> 01:01:17,212
Forgive my frustration, councillors.

617
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:21,257
But I wish I were able to comprehend
the Council's choice in this matter.

618
01:01:21,425 --> 01:01:24,594
Comprehension is not
a requisite of cooperation.

619
01:01:24,762 --> 01:01:27,222
If you are asking me
to order two of my captains...

620
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:29,099
There's no need for such an order.

621
01:01:29,266 --> 01:01:32,811
The captains are present.
They can answer for themselves.

622
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:38,525
The Council is calling for two volunteers
to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.

623
01:01:38,693 --> 01:01:42,862
Are there two among you
that would answer such call?

624
01:01:44,156 --> 01:01:47,951
Captain Soren of the Vigilant
will answer the Council's call.

625
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:51,037
You understand the situation,
Captain Soren?

626
01:01:51,205 --> 01:01:53,665
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, captain.

627
01:01:55,084 --> 01:01:56,501
Is there another?

628
01:01:57,294 --> 01:02:01,005
- Captain, I think we should volunteer.
- What? You have gone crazy.

629
01:02:01,173 --> 01:02:03,049
- Listen...
- Shut your hole, Bane...

630
01:02:03,217 --> 01:02:04,718
...before I put you in one.

631
01:02:14,562 --> 01:02:16,312
Is there no other?

632
01:02:17,064 --> 01:02:18,982
Be hard for any man to risk his life...

633
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:22,110
...especially if he doesn't
understand the reason.

634
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:26,072
Captain Niobe of the Logos
will answer the councillor's call.

635
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,491
- What?
- Thank you, Captain Niobe.

636
01:02:28,701 --> 01:02:33,788
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.

637
01:02:38,502 --> 01:02:41,087
- Niobe, what are you doing?
- What I can.

638
01:02:41,255 --> 01:02:42,297
Why?

639
01:02:43,591 --> 01:02:46,843
Because some things
never change, Jason...

640
01:02:47,011 --> 01:02:49,345
...and some things do.

641
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:07,197
What can you see, Neo?

642
01:03:07,364 --> 01:03:09,699
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.

643
01:03:09,867 --> 01:03:11,451
- Encrypted?
- Maybe.

644
01:03:11,619 --> 01:03:13,578
Is that good for us or bad for us?

645
01:03:14,288 --> 01:03:17,415
Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.

646
01:03:18,042 --> 01:03:19,584
Bad for us.

647
01:03:20,002 --> 01:03:21,503
Here we go.

648
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,836
(SPEAKS IN FRENCH)

649
01:03:29,512 --> 01:03:32,430
Yes. We are here to speak
with the Merovingian.

650
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:36,726
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.

651
01:03:36,894 --> 01:03:37,936
Follow me.

652
01:03:58,624 --> 01:04:02,293
A-ha. Here he is at last.

653
01:04:02,503 --> 01:04:05,797
Neo, the One himself.

654
01:04:05,965 --> 01:04:07,382
Right?

655
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:09,884
And the legendary Morpheus.

656
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:15,598
And Trinity, of course.
I have heard so much.

657
01:04:15,766 --> 01:04:19,227
You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.
This is my wife, Persephone.

658
01:04:20,145 --> 01:04:23,439
Something to eat? Drink?

659
01:04:23,732 --> 01:04:26,776
Of course, such things are contrivances,
like so much here.

660
01:04:26,944 --> 01:04:29,445
For the sake of appearances.

661
01:04:29,613 --> 01:04:33,074
- No, thank you.
- Yes, of course. Who has time?

662
01:04:33,242 --> 01:04:38,329
Who has time? But then, if we do not ever
take time, how can we ever have time?

663
01:04:42,042 --> 01:04:45,420
Château Haut-Briond, 1959.
Magnificent wine.

664
01:04:45,588 --> 01:04:48,506
I love French wine
like I love the French language.

665
01:04:48,674 --> 01:04:52,844
I have sampled every language. French
is my favorite. Fantastic language...

666
01:04:53,012 --> 01:04:55,138
...especially to curse with.

667
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:57,971
(SPEAKS IN FRENCH)

668
01:04:59,143 --> 01:05:03,688
You see? It's like wiping your ass
with silk. I love it.

669
01:05:05,316 --> 01:05:07,066
You know why we are here.

670
01:05:08,819 --> 01:05:13,698
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.

671
01:05:14,116 --> 01:05:19,954
The question is,
do you know why you are here?

672
01:05:20,247 --> 01:05:22,707
We are looking for the Keymaker.

673
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:27,879
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.

674
01:05:28,047 --> 01:05:31,007
But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

675
01:05:31,175 --> 01:05:34,928
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.

676
01:05:35,095 --> 01:05:40,850
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

677
01:05:41,018 --> 01:05:44,187
...what?
- You know the answer to that question.

678
01:05:44,355 --> 01:05:46,481
But do you?

679
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:49,025
You think you do, but you do not.

680
01:05:49,193 --> 01:05:52,403
You are here
because you were sent here.

681
01:05:52,571 --> 01:05:55,698
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

682
01:05:56,867 --> 01:05:59,202
It is, of course, the way of all things.

683
01:05:59,370 --> 01:06:02,038
You see, there is only one constant...

684
01:06:02,206 --> 01:06:06,376
...one universal.
It is the only real truth.

685
01:06:06,543 --> 01:06:08,211
Causality.

686
01:06:08,379 --> 01:06:10,672
Action, reaction.

687
01:06:10,839 --> 01:06:15,051
- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

688
01:06:15,219 --> 01:06:16,970
No. Wrong.

689
01:06:17,137 --> 01:06:21,724
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power...

690
01:06:21,892 --> 01:06:23,977
...and those without.

691
01:06:25,521 --> 01:06:28,690
Look there at that woman.

692
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:33,319
My God, just look at her...

693
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:36,239
...affecting everyone around her.

694
01:06:36,407 --> 01:06:41,160
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
But wait.

695
01:06:41,412 --> 01:06:45,164
Watch. You see, I have sent her
a dessert...

696
01:06:45,374 --> 01:06:49,585
...a very special dessert.

697
01:06:53,924 --> 01:06:56,384
I wrote it myself.

698
01:06:56,552 --> 01:06:59,762
It starts so simply...

699
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:04,517
...each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like...

700
01:07:05,561 --> 01:07:07,186
...poetry.

701
01:07:07,354 --> 01:07:08,771
First...

702
01:07:09,273 --> 01:07:14,694
...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.

703
01:07:15,279 --> 01:07:17,905
You can see it, Neo, yes?

704
01:07:18,532 --> 01:07:21,117
She does not understand why.

705
01:07:21,368 --> 01:07:23,786
Is it the wine? No.

706
01:07:23,954 --> 01:07:26,330
What is it then? What is the reason?

707
01:07:26,957 --> 01:07:29,292
And soon it does not matter.

708
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:32,462
Soon the why and the reason are gone...

709
01:07:33,422 --> 01:07:38,968
...and all that matters
is the feeling itself.

710
01:07:39,428 --> 01:07:42,513
And this is the nature of the universe.

711
01:07:42,681 --> 01:07:45,224
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

712
01:07:45,392 --> 01:07:47,977
...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

713
01:07:48,145 --> 01:07:52,148
Beneath our poised appearance...

714
01:07:52,316 --> 01:07:57,612
...the truth is, we are completely...

715
01:08:00,491 --> 01:08:03,367
...out of control.

716
01:08:08,707 --> 01:08:13,586
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

717
01:08:14,004 --> 01:08:19,467
Our only hope, our only peace,
is to understand it, to understand the why.

718
01:08:19,635 --> 01:08:23,054
"Why" is what separates us from them...

719
01:08:23,222 --> 01:08:25,515
...you from me.

720
01:08:25,682 --> 01:08:29,435
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.

721
01:08:29,603 --> 01:08:32,897
And this is how you come to me,
without why, without power.

722
01:08:33,065 --> 01:08:35,858
Another link in the chain.

723
01:08:36,068 --> 01:08:37,360
But fear not.

724
01:08:37,528 --> 01:08:41,405
Since I have seen how good you are
at following orders...

725
01:08:41,573 --> 01:08:44,200
...I will tell you what to do next.

726
01:08:44,701 --> 01:08:49,539
Run back and give the fortune-teller
this message:

727
01:08:49,748 --> 01:08:54,001
Her time is almost up.

728
01:08:55,045 --> 01:08:58,589
Now I have some real business to do,
so I will say adieu and goodbye.

729
01:08:58,757 --> 01:09:01,259
- This isn't over.
- Oh, yes, it is.

730
01:09:01,426 --> 01:09:07,807
The Keymaker is mine, and I see no reason
why I should give him up.

731
01:09:07,975 --> 01:09:12,019
- No reason at all.
- Where are you going?

732
01:09:12,187 --> 01:09:16,899
Please, ma cherie, I have told you.
We are all victims of causality.

733
01:09:17,067 --> 01:09:20,403
I drank too much wine,
I must take a piss.

734
01:09:20,904 --> 01:09:24,031
Cause and effect. Au Revoir.

735
01:09:29,079 --> 01:09:32,165
Touch me and that hand
will never touch anything again.

736
01:09:41,049 --> 01:09:42,550
Well, that didn't go so well.

737
01:09:42,718 --> 01:09:45,094
Are you certain the Oracle
didn't say anything else?

738
01:09:45,262 --> 01:09:47,388
- Yes.
- Maybe we did something wrong.

739
01:09:48,056 --> 01:09:49,390
Or didn't do something.

740
01:09:49,558 --> 01:09:52,810
No, what happen, happened couldn't
happened any other way.

741
01:09:52,978 --> 01:09:55,730
- How do you know?
- We are still alive.

742
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:56,936
(ELEVATOR BELL RINGS)

743
01:09:59,026 --> 01:10:02,278
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.

744
01:10:09,286 --> 01:10:11,370
Get out.

745
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:19,629
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit.
On and on. Pompous prick.

746
01:10:20,214 --> 01:10:25,718
A long time ago, when we first came here,
it was so different.

747
01:10:27,471 --> 01:10:30,181
He was so different.

748
01:10:31,975 --> 01:10:34,602
He was like you.

749
01:10:37,314 --> 01:10:41,108
I'll give you what you want,
but you have to give me something.

750
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:44,153
- What?
- A kiss.

751
01:10:44,529 --> 01:10:45,655
Excuse me?

752
01:10:47,157 --> 01:10:51,077
I want you to kiss me
as if you were kissing her.

753
01:10:52,996 --> 01:10:56,582
- Why?
- You love her. She loves you.

754
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:58,793
It's all over you both.

755
01:10:59,461 --> 01:11:04,006
A long time ago,
I knew what that felt like.

756
01:11:05,342 --> 01:11:11,097
I want to remember it.
I want to sample it. That's all.

757
01:11:11,348 --> 01:11:13,182
Just a sample.

758
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:16,352
- Why don't you sample this instead?
- Trinity.

759
01:11:18,563 --> 01:11:23,526
Such emotion over something so small.
It's just a kiss.

760
01:11:23,694 --> 01:11:25,861
Why should we trust you?

761
01:11:26,029 --> 01:11:30,032
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker,
she can kill me.

762
01:11:37,124 --> 01:11:39,250
All right.

763
01:11:39,543 --> 01:11:43,379
But you have to make me believe
I am her.

764
01:11:44,589 --> 01:11:46,632
All right.

765
01:11:52,973 --> 01:11:54,807
Terrible. Forget it.

766
01:11:57,769 --> 01:11:59,228
Wait.

767
01:12:00,147 --> 01:12:01,689
Okay.

768
01:12:38,769 --> 01:12:40,853
Yes.

769
01:12:41,438 --> 01:12:43,939
That's it.

770
01:12:58,705 --> 01:13:04,126
I envy you. But such a thing
is not meant to last.

771
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:08,506
Come with me.

772
01:13:39,579 --> 01:13:41,330
Not again.

773
01:13:44,751 --> 01:13:47,378
It's all right, boys. They're with me.

774
01:13:48,046 --> 01:13:50,423
These fellas work for my husband.

775
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:54,427
They do his dirty work.
They're very good, very loyal.

776
01:13:54,594 --> 01:13:56,137
Aren't you, boys?

01:38:12,134 --> 01:38:17,805
Inside this building, there is a level
where no elevator can go...

But one door is special.

904
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:35,489
One door leads to the source.

905
01:38:43,832 --> 01:38:48,252

it has a weakness.

908
01:38:56,011 --> 01:38:59,013
The system is based on the rules
of a building.

909
01:38:59,181 --> 01:39:02,558
- One system built on another.
- Electricity.

910
01:39:03,101 --> 01:39:07,855
- If one fails, so must the other.
- No electricity, no alarms.

911
01:39:08,023 --> 01:39:10,858
You'd have to take out a whole city block
to kill the power on a building like that.

912
01:39:11,026 --> 01:39:14,737

914
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,451
It must be destroyed.

The core network of the grid
must be accessed.

917

The emergency system
must be deactivated.

SOREN: What do you need us for?

919
01:39:35,133 --> 01:39:37,301
Neo could take both them out
easier than we could.

920
01:39:37,469 --> 01:39:39,220
- There's no time.
- Why?

921
01:39:39,388 --> 01:39:42,515
Once the door is unprotected,
the connection will be severed.

922
01:39:42,683 --> 01:39:44,976
But another connection
must first be made.

923
01:39:45,811 --> 01:39:49,647
- SOREN: How long will that take?
- KEYMAKER: Exactly 314 seconds.

924
01:39:49,815 --> 01:39:51,399
MAN: Just over five minutes.

925
01:39:51,566 --> 01:39:53,818
KEYMAKER: That is the length
and breadth of the window.

926
01:39:53,986 --> 01:39:56,278
Only the One can open the door...

927
01:39:56,488 --> 01:39:59,407
...and only during that window
can the door be opened.

928
01:40:00,659 --> 01:40:02,243
How do you know all this?

929
01:40:02,411 --> 01:40:07,581
I know because I must know.
It is my purpose.

930
01:40:07,749 --> 01:40:13,254
It's the reason I'm here,
the same reason we're all here.

931
01:40:24,016 --> 01:40:26,809
Neo, I know something's wrong.

932
01:40:27,477 --> 01:40:29,520
You don't have to tell me.

933
01:40:29,688 --> 01:40:33,441
I just want you to know that I'm here.

There are no accidents.

We have not come here by chance.
I do not believe in chance.

three captains, three ships...

I believe it is our fate to be here.
It is our destiny.

I believe this night holds
for each and every one of us...

What if I asked you to stay out of this...

01:42:31,059 --> 01:42:33,060
...no matter what...

961
01:42:33,228 --> 01:42:35,563
...to stay out of the Matrix?

help thinking, what if you're wrong?

What if all this, the prophecy,
everything, is bullshit?

Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

But how would that be different
from any other day?

This is a war, and we are soldiers.

What if I am right?
What if the prophecy is true?

What if tomorrow the war could be over?

They're already out of the station.

- There.

- What about the grid?

1032
01:49:33,982 --> 01:49:37,150
Trinity, I got some serious activity
headed your way.

1033
01:50:29,454 --> 01:50:30,829
Hello, Neo.

1034
01:50:31,372 --> 01:50:35,167
- Who are you?
- I am the Architect.

1035
01:50:35,335 --> 01:50:38,962
I created the Matrix.
I've been waiting for you.

1036
01:50:39,213 --> 01:50:43,383
You have many questions. Though the
process has altered your consciousness...

1037
01:50:43,551 --> 01:50:45,552
...you remain irrevocably human.

1038
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:49,306
Ergo, some of my answers you will
understand and some others you will not.

1039
01:50:49,724 --> 01:50:53,769
Concordantly, while your first question
may be the most pertinent...

1040
01:50:53,936 --> 01:50:57,648
...you may or may not realize
it is also the most irrelevant.

1041
01:50:58,524 --> 01:51:00,150
Why am I here?

1042
01:51:00,318 --> 01:51:04,237
Your life is the sum of a remainder
of an unbalanced equation...

1043
01:51:04,405 --> 01:51:06,740
...inherent to the programming
of the Matrix.

1044
01:51:06,908 --> 01:51:10,994
You are the eventuality of an anomaly,
which despite my sincerest efforts...

1045
01:51:11,162 --> 01:51:13,997
...I've been unable to eliminate
from what is otherwise...

1046
01:51:14,165 --> 01:51:18,627
...a harmony of mathematical precision.

1047
01:51:18,961 --> 01:51:21,296
While it remains a burden
assiduously avoided...

1048
01:51:21,464 --> 01:51:25,926
...it is not unexpected and thus
not beyond a measure of control...

1049
01:51:26,094 --> 01:51:30,055
...which has led you, inexorably...

1050
01:51:31,015 --> 01:51:32,265
...here.

1051
01:51:32,433 --> 01:51:36,520
- You haven't answered my question.
- Quite right.

1052
01:51:36,688 --> 01:51:40,482
Interesting.
That was quicker than the others.

1053
01:51:40,650 --> 01:51:43,276
NEOS: Others? How many?
What others?

1054
01:51:43,444 --> 01:51:45,946
The Matrix is older than you know.

1055
01:51:46,114 --> 01:51:50,117
I prefer counting from the emergence of one
integral anomaly to the emergence of the next.

1056
01:51:50,284 --> 01:51:52,536
In which case, this is the sixth version.

1057
01:51:52,704 --> 01:51:55,163
NEOS: Five before me?
He's lying. Bullshit.

1058
01:51:55,331 --> 01:51:58,875
There are only two possible explanations.
There were five before me.

1059
01:51:59,043 --> 01:52:00,335
Either no one told me...

1060
01:52:01,587 --> 01:52:05,590
- ...or no one knows.
- Precisely.

1061
01:52:05,758 --> 01:52:09,052
As you are undoubtedly gathering,
the anomaly is systemic...

1062
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:12,639
...creating fluctuations in even
the most simplistic equations.

1063
01:52:12,807 --> 01:52:16,059
You can't control me!
I'm gonna smash you to bits!

1064
01:52:16,227 --> 01:52:18,019
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1065
01:52:18,187 --> 01:52:21,356
You can't make me do anything.
You old, white prick!

1066
01:52:23,651 --> 01:52:25,152
Choice.

1067
01:52:25,319 --> 01:52:27,154
The problem is choice.

1068
01:52:27,699 --> 01:52:28,735
(ELEVATOR BELL RINGS)

1069
01:52:49,385 --> 01:52:53,013
The first Matrix I designed was quite
naturally perfect, it is a work of art.

1070
01:52:53,181 --> 01:52:55,015
Flawless, sublime.

1071
01:52:55,183 --> 01:52:58,685
A triumph equaled only
by its monumental failure.

1072
01:52:59,353 --> 01:53:01,772
The inevitability of its doom
is apparent now...

1073
01:53:01,939 --> 01:53:05,275
...as a consequence of the imperfection
inherent in every human being.

1074
01:53:05,443 --> 01:53:08,403
Thus, I redesigned it
based on your history...

1075
01:53:08,571 --> 01:53:12,574
...to more accurately reflect
the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

1076
01:53:13,284 --> 01:53:17,037
However, I was again frustrated
by failure.

1077
01:53:18,498 --> 01:53:21,124
I have since come to understand
that the answer eluded me...

1078
01:53:21,292 --> 01:53:23,335
...because it required a lesser mind.

1079
01:53:23,503 --> 01:53:29,466
Or perhaps, a mind less bound
by the parameters of perfection.

1080
01:53:29,884 --> 01:53:34,304
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon
by another, an intuitive program...

1081
01:53:34,472 --> 01:53:39,267
...initially created to investigate
certain aspects of the human psyche.

1082
01:53:39,435 --> 01:53:45,398
If I am the father of the Matrix,
she would undoubtedly be its mother.

1083
01:53:46,025 --> 01:53:48,318
- The Oracle.
- Please.

1084
01:53:49,028 --> 01:53:53,031
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a
solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...

1085
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:56,076
...accepted the program, as long as they
were given a choice...

1086
01:53:56,244 --> 01:54:00,372
...even if they were only aware
of the choice at a near unconscious level.

1087
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:03,959
While this answer functioned,
it was obviously fundamentally flawed...

1088
01:54:04,126 --> 01:54:08,129
...thus creating the otherwise
contradictory systemic anomaly...

1089
01:54:08,297 --> 01:54:11,007
...that, if left unchecked,
might threaten the system itself.

1090
01:54:11,384 --> 01:54:15,512
Ergo, those that refused the program,
while a minority, if unchecked...

1091
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:19,766
...would constitute
an escalating probability of disaster.

1092
01:54:19,934 --> 01:54:21,726
This is about Zion.

1093
01:54:22,186 --> 01:54:25,856
You are here because Zion
is about to be destroyed.

1094
01:54:26,023 --> 01:54:30,443
Its every living inhabitant terminated,
its entire existence eradicated.

1095
01:54:30,736 --> 01:54:31,778
Bullshit.

1096
01:54:31,946 --> 01:54:35,115
Denial is the most predictable
of all human responses.

1097
01:54:35,324 --> 01:54:41,788
But rest assured, this will be
the sixth time we have destroyed it...

1098
01:54:41,956 --> 01:54:45,959
...and we have become
exceedingly efficient at it.

1099
01:54:58,681 --> 01:54:59,973
The function of the One...

1100
01:55:00,141 --> 01:55:04,811
...is now to return to the source, allowing a
temporary dissemination of the code you carry...

1101
01:55:04,979 --> 01:55:06,688
...reinserting the prime program.

1102
01:55:07,273 --> 01:55:11,276
After which you will be required to select
from the Matrix 23 individuals...

1103
01:55:11,444 --> 01:55:14,696
...sixteen female, seven male,
to rebuild Zion.

1104
01:55:14,864 --> 01:55:19,409
Failure to comply with this process will
result in a cataclysmic system crash...

1105
01:55:19,577 --> 01:55:21,912
...killing everyone connected
to the Matrix...

1106
01:55:22,079 --> 01:55:24,664
...which, coupled with the
extermination of Zion...

1107
01:55:24,832 --> 01:55:29,044
...will ultimately result in the extinction
of the entire human race.

1108
01:55:29,378 --> 01:55:33,465
You won't let it happen. You can't.
You need human beings to survive.

1109
01:55:34,258 --> 01:55:37,886
There are levels of survival
we are prepared to accept.

1110
01:55:38,054 --> 01:55:40,847
However the relevant issue is
whether or not you are ready...

1111
01:55:41,015 --> 01:55:44,601
...to accept the responsibility for the
death of every human being in this world.

1112
01:55:51,067 --> 01:55:53,610
It is interesting reading your reactions.

1113
01:55:54,654 --> 01:55:58,490
Your five predecessors were, by design,
based on a similar predication...

1114
01:55:58,658 --> 01:56:03,119
...a contingent affirmation that was meant
to create a profound attachment...

1115
01:56:03,287 --> 01:56:06,873
...to the rest of your species,
facilitating the function of the One.

1116
01:56:07,041 --> 01:56:09,376
While the others experience this
in a very general way...

1117
01:56:09,543 --> 01:56:12,504
...your experience is far more specific...

1118
01:56:12,838 --> 01:56:15,715
...vis-à-vis love.

1119
01:56:16,717 --> 01:56:18,343
Trinity!

1120
01:56:20,638 --> 01:56:24,975
Apropos, she entered the Matrix
to save your life at the cost of her own.

1121
01:56:25,351 --> 01:56:26,393
No.

1122
01:56:27,103 --> 01:56:31,231
Which brings us at last to the moment
of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...

1123
01:56:31,399 --> 01:56:34,484
...is ultimately expressed
and the anomaly revealed...

1124
01:56:34,652 --> 01:56:38,655
...as both beginning and end.

1125
01:56:38,823 --> 01:56:40,490
There are two doors.

1126
01:56:40,658 --> 01:56:43,868
The door to your right leads to the source
and the salvation of Zion.

1127
01:56:44,453 --> 01:56:50,750
The door to your left leads back to the Matrix,
to her and to the end of your species.

1128
01:56:50,918 --> 01:56:55,296
As you adequately put,
the problem is choice.

1129
01:56:55,464 --> 01:56:58,967
But we already know what
you are going to do, don't we?

1130
01:56:59,135 --> 01:57:03,221
Already I can see the chain reaction,
the chemical precursors that signal...

1131
01:57:03,389 --> 01:57:08,643
...the onset of an emotion designed
specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.

1132
01:57:08,811 --> 01:57:13,440
An emotion that is already blinding you
from the simple and obvious truth:

1133
01:57:13,607 --> 01:57:20,113
She is going to die and there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

1134
01:57:25,119 --> 01:57:29,247
Hope. It is the quintessential
human delusion, simultaneously...

1135
01:57:29,415 --> 01:57:33,126
...the source of your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness.

1136
01:57:33,294 --> 01:57:37,630
If I were you, I would hope
that we don't meet again.

1137
01:57:37,798 --> 01:57:39,215
We won't.

1138
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:48,850
We got a serious situation, sir.

1139
01:57:49,310 --> 01:57:50,393
MORPHEUS: Oh, no.

1140

(RUMBLING)

1141
01:58:50,037 --> 01:58:53,581
- MORPHEUS: What was that?
- Whatever it is. It's moving faster than anything I've ever seen.

1142
01:59:44,216 --> 01:59:46,009
Holy shit, he caught her.

Neo, I had to.

1145
02:00:01,942 --> 02:00:03,693
I know.

1146
02:00:08,741 --> 02:00:11,284
The bullet is still inside.

1149
02:00:25,174 --> 02:00:26,883
...don't you quit on me now.

1150
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:38,645
I'm sorry.

NEO: Trinity.

1152

Trinity...

1153
02:00:59,541 --> 02:01:01,334
...I know you can hear me.

1154
02:01:02,127 --> 02:01:04,671
I'm not letting go.

1155
02:01:04,838 --> 02:01:06,464
I can't.

1156
02:01:07,675 --> 02:01:09,884
I love you too damn much.

1157
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:39,872
I can't take this.

1158
02:01:43,627 --> 02:01:46,713
I guess this makes us even.

1159
02:01:59,393 --> 02:02:01,352
I don't understand it.

1160
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:04,522
Everything was done
as it was supposed to be done.

1161
02:02:04,690 --> 02:02:07,734
Once the One reaches the source,
the war should be over.

1162
02:02:07,901 --> 02:02:10,737
- In 24 hours, it will be.
- What?

1163
02:02:10,904 --> 02:02:15,241
If we don't do something in 24 hours,
Zion will be destroyed.

1164
02:02:15,659 --> 02:02:17,285
- What?
- How do you know that?

1165
02:02:17,745 --> 02:02:19,787
- I was told it would happen.
- By whom?

1166
02:02:20,789 --> 02:02:23,624
It doesn't matter. I believed him.

1167
02:02:23,792 --> 02:02:27,628
- That's impossible. The prophecy tells us...
- It was a lie, Morpheus.

1168
02:02:29,381 --> 02:02:31,924
The prophecy was a lie.

1169
02:02:33,135 --> 02:02:36,137
The One was never meant
to end anything.

1170
02:02:36,305 --> 02:02:39,349
It was all another system of control.

1171
02:02:39,516 --> 02:02:42,602
I don't believe that.

1172
02:02:42,936 --> 02:02:45,271
But you said it yourself.

1173
02:02:45,439 --> 02:02:49,442
How can the prophecy be true
if the war isn't over?

1174
02:02:55,616 --> 02:02:58,076
I'm sorry.

1175

I know it isn't easy to hear, but...

1176
02:03:01,789 --> 02:03:04,957
...I swear to you it's the truth.

Oh, no!

- They're just out of EMP range.

02:03:27,481 --> 02:03:28,731
It's a bomb.

1182
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:32,110
We have to get out of here. Now.

1183
02:04:08,814 --> 02:04:10,690
I have dreamed a dream...

1184
02:04:13,735 --> 02:04:17,113
...but now that dream
has gone from me.

1185

Here they come.

1186
02:04:30,669 --> 02:04:32,378
Let's go, Morpheus.

1187
02:04:33,797 --> 02:04:36,841
- We won't make it.
- We have to try.

1188
02:04:44,558 --> 02:04:47,560
- Come on!
- Something's different.

1189
02:04:47,728 --> 02:04:49,729
What?

1190
02:04:50,397 --> 02:04:51,898

It's the Hammer.

WOMAN: He's in some kind of coma...

1196
02:05:47,913 --> 02:05:50,164
...but his vitals are stable.

1197
02:05:51,375 --> 02:05:53,292
What about you?

1198
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:55,586
I'm fine.

1199
02:05:55,754 --> 02:05:58,130
You could use some rest.

1200
02:05:58,298 --> 02:06:00,132
No, I'm gonna stay with him.

1201
02:06:07,224 --> 02:06:09,850
Lock was right.
He guessed that the machines...

1202
02:06:10,018 --> 02:06:12,895
...would cut off the mainlines
in and out of Zion.

1203
02:06:13,063 --> 02:06:15,815
He thought a counterattack
might surprise them.

1204
02:06:16,066 --> 02:06:19,485
It sounded good.
I figured we had a shot...

1205
02:06:19,820 --> 02:06:22,363
...until someone screwed it up.

1206
02:06:22,531 --> 02:06:25,157
An EMP was triggered before
we got in position.

1207
02:06:25,325 --> 02:06:27,201
Five ships were instantly downed.

1208
02:06:27,369 --> 02:06:29,161
When the machines broke through...

1209
02:06:29,329 --> 02:06:32,540
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

1210
02:06:32,708 --> 02:06:35,543
Was it an accident?
Some sort of malfunction?

1211
02:06:35,711 --> 02:06:38,170
- No one knows.
- Someone does.

1212
02:06:38,338 --> 02:06:40,089
Who?

1213
02:06:40,257 --> 02:06:43,968
Once the machines were done with us,
they started digging again.

1214
02:06:44,136 --> 02:06:46,429
We made a quick pass
to look for survivors.

1215
02:06:46,638 --> 02:06:47,722
You found one?

1216
02:06:49,474 --> 02:06:51,183
Only one.

02:16:51,868 --> 02:16:54,745
I see the end coming.

02:16:54,913 --> 02:16:58,707
I see the darkness spreading.
I see death.

Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

1222
02:17:04,005 --> 02:17:06,006
