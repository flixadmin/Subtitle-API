1
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:39,125
When you've been locked up for 100 hours,
chained, about to be killed,

2
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,833
and you've lost your best friend, 
those 100 hours feel like 100 years.

3
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,083
And going outside…

4
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,041
the biggest freedom in the world.

5
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,875
Who cares if soldiers are aiming at you?

6
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,375
Unarmed,

7
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:01,625
barefoot,

8
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,833
with the sun on your face
and surrounded by silence…

9
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,083
you feel free.

10
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,250
We were sending a message of hope.

11
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:22,750
Lisbon was there with us,
walking out of the bank,

12
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:28,041
not at the National Court
or in prison like everyone thought.

13
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,250
Colonel Tamayo!

14
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,041
White flag!

15
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:40,750
We were telling them that
if we could do that…

16
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,041
we could do anything.

17
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,708
And people started to believe in miracles.

18
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,166
I want your team ready
in one minute, Suárez!

19
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,833
I want a clean operation!

20
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,583
Top priority is those three bitches,
then the hostages.

21
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,875
I want them here!
I don't care how you do it.

22
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,375
You heard him! I want everyone ready.

23
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,541
We can't do that, Tamayo.

24
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:13,166
She pissed on our faces.
I'm going to wipe her out, no matter what.

25
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,583
-30 seconds!
-They're waving a white flag.

26
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,125
It's been a symbol of peace
since the Punic wars.

27
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,000
Even the Nazis respected it.

28
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,541
Are we going to dismiss it
with the whole world watching?

29
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:23,833
We're ready!

30
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,958
-We're awaiting your orders.
-I heard you! I'm thinking.

31
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,208
-If we negotiate, we're shitheads.
-No.

32
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:40,541
This battle is to show who the good
and bad guys are in this war.

33
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,416
If they have a corridor, so do we.

34
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,958
We have to project a friendly image.
No tie.

35
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,000
No jacket. Sleeves rolled up
and no bullet-proof vest.

36
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,583
I'll look like a wimp.

37
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,458
You'll look solid as a rock, Tamayo.
You have to be tough.

38
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,666
You'll give them an ultimatum.
In two minutes, we go in.

39
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:03,083
We need to cause panic in there.
Let them know they're fucked.

40
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,583
You're giving me a hard-on.

41
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:10,250
Set up a security corridor
so I can negotiate with them.

42
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,833
-Go get them, Colonel!
-Go, Colonel!

43
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,416
Governor.

44
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,291
What's the army doing here?

45
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,458
This isn't a civil conflict anymore.

46
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,666
Two battalions, assault troops…

47
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,666
They're going in.

48
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,125
It's about time.

49
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,875
That's not good news.

50
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,166
To the police, we're hostages.

51
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,500
To the army, we're collateral damage.

52
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,875
Leaving the security perimeter.

53
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,625
And what's that supposed to mean?

54
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,166
They'll shoot anyone
that's wearing a mask.

55
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,375
Their priority is to kill them,

56
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,250
not rescue us.

57
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,375
The Three Graces have come to put
a friendly face to the heist's name.

58
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,708
We've come out with our faces uncovered
so everyone can see

59
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,875
I'm not at the National Court,

60
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,833
I'm not being interrogated in the tent
and I'm not in prison.

61
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,291
-What the fuck do you want?
-Gandía's injured.

62
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,333
I have to show you something.

63
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,666
Raise your hand,
everyone knows what that means.

64
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,416
Palermo.

65
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,666
Let's see, you slimy snake.

66
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,666
Come on.

67
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,666
There's shrapnel
between his cervical vertebrae.

68
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,000
One wrong move
and he'll never move his arm…

69
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,708
or his lungs, again.
It's called the phrenic nerve.

70
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,375
He urgently needs a neurosurgeon.

71
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,250
One from the army, if you want.
You've got a few.

72
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,833
What are we waiting for?

73
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,541
Let's run to the tent. Now!

74
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,791
They won't shoot us.
We can't go back in the bank.

75
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,083
Of course we can.

76
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,958
Our fellow hostages have no idea.

77
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,666
They'll find out eventually.
It's every man for himself out here.

78
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,750
We have the moral obligation
to do something.

79
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,083
You came in here to be a hero, right?

80
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,541
Well, now's the time.

81
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,416
If I send a doctor in,
I'll have to wait 3 or 4 hours

82
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,375
to get the army in,
which you know I'll do.

83
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:50,208
That's why you're using
the only card you have. Gandía's injury.

84
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,500
Will you let a man you used be paralyzed?

85
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,750
-Let him go. I'll treat him.
-I get nothing out of that.

86
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,083
You do.

87
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,625
I'll tell you why.

88
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,250
If you don't let him go,
I go in right now.

89
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:10,708
But if you do, until he tells me
what you're up to in there,

90
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,541
I may as well wait an hour.

91
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,750
It's up to you.

92
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,041
Give us a minute to discuss it.

93
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:19,791
Of course.

94
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,458
It looks like
I'm getting out before you, Sandokan.

95
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,916
What the fuck are you doing, Bogotá?

96
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,750
At that moment…

97
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,666
We need to release Gandía.
We need that hour.

98
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,750
…Lisbon was the only one
who noticed a tiny detail…

99
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:40,666
Lisbon?

100
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,625
…that would radically
change the rules of the game.

101
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,625
They don't have the Professor.

102
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,416
-What?
-What?

103
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:52,166
He gave us an ultimatum
and didn't use his trump card.

104
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,333
If you can checkmate
in one move and don't…

105
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,250
it's because you don't know you can.

106
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,291
Exactly.

107
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,208
Sierra's a lone ranger.

108
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,333
I'm starting to like that nutcase.

109
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,708
Get Gandía ready.

110
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,583
I'm going to fight this piece of shit.

111
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,791
Bogotá, stop!

112
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,666
I may be destroyed,
but I'm still going to beat your ass.

113
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,416
Shit, Bogotá! We're letting him go.
We can't give them scraps.

114
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
He'll be carried out feet first.

115
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,000
Hurry up, the minister is waiting
for me with a medal.

116
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,375
Shut up, asshole!

117
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,583
Every time you punch him,
you're punching us.

118
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,750
Your pride's going to fuck us all.

119
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,250
We're already fucked.

120
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,750
This won't change a thing.
Dignity is all we have left.

121
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,583
That's revenge.

122
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,916
-Revenge is a selfish act, you know that.
-It's respect.

123
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,708
Respect for us
and respect for our executed colleague.

124
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,666
-That's what this is.
-I'm with him!

125
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,500
Are you all morons or what?

126
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,625
Lisbon has agreed to release him.
She's buying time.

127
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,083
I don't know Lisbon, but I knew Nairobi.

128
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,416
We're destroying him
before they fuck us over.

129
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,708
Oh, now you're going to kill him?

130
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,000
You're the asshole who says
"Kill him," from behind,

131
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,458
because you couldn't do it
when you had the chance!

132
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,416
You didn't have the balls to do it.
You stopped in your tracks.

133
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,833
So stop being stupid!

134
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,416
You're going to beat each other up, too.

135
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,166
Are you really coming after me?

136
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,083
He's the perpetrator,
he pulled the trigger.

137
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,666
And the mastermind is that bastard.

138
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,750
So stop busting my balls, okay?

139
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,708
Do you want me
to take some flowers to forensics?

140
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,791
Your friend must still be warm.

141
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,500
And even firm.

142
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:48,500
What would you do if Stockholm were dead?
You hit Arturo when he teased you.

143
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,916
This motherfucker killed one of us.

144
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,375
What's reason enough for you
doesn't apply to us?

145
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,958
Do whatever the fuck you want.

146
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,875
Is it that important to you?

147
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:04,666
Brother…

148
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,666
We need this
so we can look each other in the eye.

149
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,875
He's all yours.

150
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,791
Let's enjoy recess
before the girls come back.

151
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,791
-Let's go.
-Let's do this.

152
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,916
We'll let Gandía go.

153
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,375
But before we do,
I need to check with the Professor.

154
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,458
Ask him whatever you want.

155
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,750
You've got four minutes.

156
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,000
What do you suggest we do?

157
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,791
Organize an escape.

158
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,666
With 10, 15 or 20 hostages.

159
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,166
Deal.

160
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,791
Take them to a safe area.

161
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:15,875
-You know there are no safe areas inside.
-Of course there are.

162
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,416
Come on…

163
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:21,125
Any of the four vaults
that open with my fingerprint.

164
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,083
Hit me.

165
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:28,541
I said hit me.

166
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,166
Hit me!

167
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:43,250
-Do you know why I'm going to kill you?
-Because I groped your girlfriend's ass.

168
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,166
No…

169
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,000
Because you're a fascist.

170
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,000
As soon as you lift a gun
to defend your country,

171
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,041
some asshole calls you a fascist.

172
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,625
Open the door!

173
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,708
You're fascist for saying "mutt."

174
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,291
"Gypsy."

175
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,583
What the hell?

176
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,291
Close the doors! Get in line!

177
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,250
Back off! Now!

178
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,291
-I said back off!
-"Redneck!"

179
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,750
-Against the wall! Hands up!
-Stop it!

180
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,875
For calling Palermo a "one-eyed queer…"

181
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,083
Right now!

182
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,375
-Leave them alone!
-Stop it!

183
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,875
…and a "wetback!"

184
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,666
-What are you doing?
-You're racist!

185
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,625
We're trying to make miracles happen
and you set up a fight.

186
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,791
You're sexist!

187
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,041
-Stop them!
-No!

188
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,791
You're homophobic!

189
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,000
And this is for Nairobi.

190
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,125
Bogotá.

191
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,458
Bogotá.

192
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,833
-He killed Nairobi.
-The police don't have the Professor.

193
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,250
Nairobi wouldn't want this.

194
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,750
Tamayo doesn't know anything
about the Professor. It's not checkmate.

195
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,125
We stand a chance.

196
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,500
-He killed her.
-Let him go.

197
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,666
Let him go.

198
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,083
Do I still turn you on?

199
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,500
Tokyo…

200
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,291
You missed it.

201
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,291
Boom.

202
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,250
Come on, recess is over!

203
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,833
-Stitch him up.
-I'll kill you, asshole!

204
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,125
She knocked me out, fucking Sandokan!

205
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,333
Not you!

206
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,208
On the ground, you terrorists!

207
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,958
Fuck!

208
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,000
-This way, come on!
-Get them out of here!

209
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,375
-Denver!
-Denver!

210
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,708
Fucking hell.

211
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,916
It's okay, keep calm.

212
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,416
Let me see the wound.

213
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,250
-Stay calm. It's okay.
-There's an exit wound.

214
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,916
I need the surgical kit.

215
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,833
-Now!
-Coming.

216
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,833
Get the kit. Your gun, let's go!

217
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,875
Helsinki, Manila, the hostages have fled.

218
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,000
They hit Denver and some of their own.
They've got weapons!

219
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,083
Copy that.

220
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:48,666
Let's go!

221
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,708
You stay here. Don't let anyone move.

222
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,458
Let's go!

223
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,916
Let me see.

224
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,041
That son of a bitch.

225
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,833
Denver.

226
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,541
Fix Gandía, he's top priority!

227
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,291
Denver!

228
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,708
Fuck!

229
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,833
I need a medical unit by the door!

230
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:24,416
The bank's head of security is about
to come out with a severe prognosis.

231
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,583
You're the next to move.
You're in charge of the intervention.

232
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,875
-With what men?
-Special Forces III.

233
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,000
You know most of them. They're the best.

234
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,166
-Cañizo!
-At your command, sir!

235
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,083
Get your men ready immediately.

236
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,041
Yes, sir.

237
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,708
-How's the recording?
-It sounds like a shooting.

238
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,750
I told you I'd go in with my team.

239
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,750
I want them.

240
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,625
The guys you requested
are out of the question.

241
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,500
Colonel, it's going to be a massacre.

242
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,708
I need men who won't ask who's behind
the mask when they have to shoot.

243
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,541
And Special Forces will,
because somewhere in their brains

244
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,375
lies the notion of rescuing hostages.

245
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:10,375
I need people who will go in there
to conquer territory, not to save lives.

246
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,916
What percentage of civilian casualties
are we talking about?

247
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,375
Well, don't count on more than…

248
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,458
thirty percent surviving.

249
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,291
Either I go in with my team…
or I don't go in.

250
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,250
Your team?

251
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,541
Mateo Canalejas,
arrested for playing Russian roulette

252
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,083
with his service weapon
in a joint in Tbilisi.

253
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:40,041
Arantxa Arteche organizes
illegal monkey fights in Gibraltar.

254
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,041
What a fucking joke.

255
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,125
Salvador Torrecilla
pretended Boko Haram kidnapped him

256
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,541
after spending six days copulating
with the chancellor's daughter in Mali.

257
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,958
Shall I continue?
Ramiro Vázquez, your trusted bomb expert,

258
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,791
is in the Mondragón mental hospital.

259
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:56,166
I'm aware of all that.
They're all outside, waiting.

260
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,375
I called them
when the Professor started throwing bills.

261
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,375
Should I get them…

262
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,458
Colonel?

263
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:10,750
Sagasta.

264
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,041
Don't fuck with me.

265
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,541
Go to the right!

266
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,666
Palermo! Come out to play, motherfucker!

267
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:38,791
Fuck!

268
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,416
Fuck!

269
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,208
-Shoot the vests!
-Shoot the ceiling!

270
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,583
Get down.

271
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,791
-Helsinki, they're headed your way.
-Get down!

272
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,333
Do you copy, fatty?

273
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,833
Help!

274
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:05,958
We're right here!

275
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,750
Cover me!

276
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:14,583
Lisbon!

277
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,291
We're trapped! There's no way out!

278
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,125
I don't want to die!

279
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,583
We won't make it to the vaults,

280
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,166
but we can get them out
through the loading dock.

281
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,000
-How?
-Through the next door. Cover us!

282
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,083
Come on!

283
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,375
-For fuck's sake!
-Fuck!

284
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,916
-They're heading to the loading docks.
-Follow them!

285
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,125
Palermo, with me.
We'll use the other door.

286
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,416
Helsinki! Go to the top floor.
Report any troop movement.

287
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,666
Weapons, ammunition, men, anything.
I want to know if they're coming.

288
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,000
Let's go.

289
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:16,000
Let's go! Matías,
take five of your hostages.

290
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,041
Let's go!

291
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,000
To the library, now!

292
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,375
Come on!

293
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,541
Inspector.

294
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,875
It's confirmed, shots were fired.

295
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,583
Through this hallway. Run!

296
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,375
Let's go. Down this hallway.

297
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,916
-Run!
-This way!

298
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Run!

299
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,833
They're coming!

300
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:03,708
Fuck!

301
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,541
Get down.

302
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,708
Okay, let's go.

303
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:12,833
Back off!

304
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,250
Shoot the vests.

305
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,208
Watch out!

306
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,333
Come on!

307
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,125
Shit.

308
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,541
We're fucked.

309
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,125
Let's go, guys. This way!

310
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,708
-They've blocked the exit with steel…
-Shit.

311
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,666
…and explosives.

312
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,708
They're the ones who are fucked, Governor.

313
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,333
All their weapons are here.

314
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,791
My name is Alicia Sierra.

315
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:15,500
I'm an inspector with the National Police…
They've issued a warrant for my arrest.

316
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,750
I'm recording this video
in case the police or the CNI

317
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:23,458
try to hide, distort
or misrepresent the real facts.

318
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:29,458
But I won't fall apart on you all
because today calls for celebration.

319
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,375
Here we are. Look who's here with me.

320
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:37,250
Let's see. Here we are, in the hideout…

321
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,000
of this smart little animal.

322
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:41,916
The Professor.

323
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,458
Wave to the camera, Mr. Marquina.

324
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:47,958
Mr. Marquina?

325
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,541
-This isn't necessary.
-Of course it is.

326
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:53,750
Tell us, Mr. Professor, who arrested you?

327
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,458
-You did.
-You, who?

328
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,000
Do your part.

329
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:04,250
I've been arrested
by inspector Alicia Sierra.

330
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,166
Exactly!

331
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,166
Cross my heart and hope to die.

332
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:14,750
I, Alicia Sierra,
at 9:50 a.m. on April 8th,

333
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:19,500
located the abandoned stormwater tank
at kilometer 21 on the road--

334
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:20,750
Can I tell the truth?

335
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,375
I'd like to tell the truth.

336
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:27,708
Go ahead.

337
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:36,833
I recruited one of your officers.
He was part of the Paris Plan.

338
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,875
We recruited Mr. Benito Antoñanzas.

339
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,708
Antoñanzas jumped
into his gated community's swimming pool

340
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:47,125
from his home,
specifically from his bathroom window.

341
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:51,541
And that's when I began to leave a trail.

342
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:58,375
In your colleague's defense, we made
him fear for his and his family's life--

343
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:01,541
Shut the fuck up.
What did you have for lunch, a parrot?

344
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,750
He won't stop chatting.

345
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:06,791
I'm trying to set the facts straight
and tell the truth.

346
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,541
You've been lying the whole time.

347
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,333
You didn't even tell
your brother the truth.

348
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,208
-What's going on?
-That's why now's the time…

349
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,708
Fuck you. Keep your fucking mouth shut!

350
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,500
Marseille!

351
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:23,000
I'll blow your fucking head off.
Shut your mouth.

352
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:27,750
Marseille! Code red!

353
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,916
Marseille! Benjamín!

354
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,833
Marseille!

355
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:50,125
Shit!

356
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,250
Hell yeah.

357
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:59,958
Marseille! Police!

358
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:06,708
Marseille! Police!

359
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,500
I'm not a police officer anymore,
four-eyes.

360
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:15,708
Marse…

361
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:17,833
Marseille…

362
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,458
Mars…

363
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:36,958
-You need a tourniquet.
-I'm okay.

364
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:48,000
Come on, Amanda, Miguel, grab some guns.

365
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:50,083
You can do it.

366
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:52,541
Let's go, you two!

367
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,708
The windows.

368
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:00,708
You two, cover from the windows.

369
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:07,583
-Do you know what you're doing?
-Of course. What has to be done.

370
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:09,416
I don't think you do.

371
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:32,375
The windows!

372
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:40,666
Get back! Get out of here!

373
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:49,583
Stop this. You got two people injured.

374
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:52,625
Yes, but I saved four
and we've got their weapons.

375
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:53,583
Look at me!

376
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:56,333
They both have families.

377
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:03,083
It wasn't my fault.
It was the damn recoil.

378
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:04,958
Collateral damage.

379
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:09,000
This is war! Can't you see?
Churchill would see it as a victory.

380
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:11,291
Ammunition?

381
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,250
-Two clips.
-What?

382
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:19,041
We can't cover the hallway with two clips.

383
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:20,166
God damn it.

384
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:23,083
We need to blow it up.

385
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:26,708
If the weapons in there explode,
the entire building will collapse.

386
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:29,833
-We have no other choice.
-We need grenades.

387
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,666
Where the hell do we get those?

388
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:37,083
I know where there are grenades.
And much more.

389
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:40,666
Distract them. They won't suspect
we went to get explosives. Lisbon…

390
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,750
Good luck, Tokyo!

391
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:58,750
We heard shots in the building.
Something serious is going on.

392
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:02,791
It's the same as always.
The Valencia or Beijing Plan. It's a show.

393
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:05,375
They're blowing stuff up
so we change our road map.

394
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:08,500
They're assault rifles.
There are civilians in there.

395
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,000
-Suárez, please.
-Colonel.

396
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:13,041
Are you organizing
an operation behind my back?

397
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:16,750
-Would it be an issue if I were?
-This is a civil conflict.

398
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:21,500
-I demand to be part of any intervention.
-You demand? Who do you think you are?

399
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:25,125
I'm the inspector in charge
of the special operations group.

400
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:30,041
No matter how hard you try to ignore us,
let me remind you we killed Berlin

401
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,083
while fighting against his Browning.

402
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:39,250
Sagasta!

403
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,791
Sagasta, go in with your team. Right now!

404
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:50,041
Okay.

405
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,500
Rio! Come with me.

406
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:06,125
-Motherfucker!
-Don't move!

407
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:08,750
You're a son of a bitch, Denver.

408
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:09,666
What?

409
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:14,625
You kicked me out of the previous heist,
the good one.

410
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:17,583
But you call me for this one,
which is a fucking mousetrap.

411
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:21,666
I'm doing this because I'm a good person,
but I should be doing this to your balls!

412
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,708
Back off!

413
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:39,833
Denver!

414
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:43,583
Listen. You're bleeding
like a stuck pig, come back.

415
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:47,250
Okay. Your arm will go numb,
but it'll be fine, okay?

416
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,958
You can go now.

417
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:53,500
-What are you going to do with that?
-Make them dance.

418
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,583
Didn't you say we should be heroes?
That's exactly what I'm doing.

419
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,708
The hostages are in the armory

420
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,250
and we have two fucking clips left.

421
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:05,166
I'm not going anywhere.

422
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:10,333
We can't attack rashly.
We have their weapons.

423
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:12,916
It's a matter of time
until the army attacks.

424
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,875
Honey. Dani, sweetie, please come back.

425
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:18,375
I'm fine, okay? I'm great.

426
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:19,541
You're not fine.

427
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,833
It's our job to defend
this position intelligently.

428
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:30,000
Defend? An Italian defense? Huh?

429
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,541
With little Messi on our team?

430
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,083
And Neymar?

431
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,333
And Cristiano Ronaldo?

432
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:44,666
No, we're not playing defense here.
We're playing tiki-taka!

433
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,791
Come on, go get some cover.

434
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,083
Your turn.

435
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:12,666
-Grenade!
-Grenade!

436
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:31,916
Are you okay?

437
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:34,875
How are you?

438
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,291
Bad!

439
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,375
Arturo!

440
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:43,833
I'm going to rip your balls off!

441
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:46,958
They're right here, you bastard!

442
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,375
Come pay me a visit!

443
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,375
Fucking hell!

444
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:20,500
-Are you okay?
-No!

445
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:29,916
They've got enough ammo for four wars!

446
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,333
We're fucked!

447
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,708
-What is this?
-Put it down, it's a flamethrower.

448
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,750
A flamethrower, huh?

449
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:46,666
Everything in here
is flammable and explosive!

450
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,750
Don't worry, Governor.

451
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,625
The barbecue will be out there.

452
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:58,625
…is for all of you who see this mask

453
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:00,666
as a symbol of the resistance.

454
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,708
We need you.

455
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:09,333
The State has declared war on us.

456
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:12,416
A filthy war.

457
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,166
Professor?

458
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,208
And we've decided to face them.

459
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,208
The police have detained
one of us in a foreign country.

460
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:30,666
Aníbal Cortés.

461
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:34,166
It's been almost two months
since his arrest.

462
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,875
They haven't filed
formal charges against him.

463
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,208
Professor?

464
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:42,958
They haven't requested extradition.

465
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:45,166
Marseille. The bathroom.

466
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,125
-They haven't provided him with a lawyer.
-Go check it out.

467
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:51,875
He's being held captive…

468
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:54,625
Hello?

469
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:56,833
Anyone in there?

470
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:59,708
…somewhere unknown, and in all likelihood…

471
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:02,458
they're torturing him.

472
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,750
So we demand

473
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,916
that this illegal detention
be brought to an end immediately

474
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,625
and that he be brought to justice in a way
that respects legal standards.

475
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:18,208
-The State started this war…
-Benjamín.

476
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:20,833
…and we will not hide.

477
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:22,166
He's sleeping.

478
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:24,458
We will fight,

479
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:27,333
blow…

480
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,750
for blow.

481
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:31,666
And this time…

482
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:37,083
it will be an even bigger heist.

483
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:39,541
Well done, Professor.

484
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,583
The next shots
will clear out the whole toilet,

485
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:51,208
so throw your gun under the door
and come out behind it.

486
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,000
Very well.

487
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:57,000
Three, two…

488
00:35:58,666 --> 00:35:59,500
one.

489
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:06,333
Who the fuck are you?

490
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,875
-Logroño?
-I…

491
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,875
don't have a…

492
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,583
city name.

493
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:23,041
Shit! The tank is running out of oxygen.

494
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:34,416
It's refilling. It'll take a minute.

495
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:49,666
In the bathtub,
I told you to break up with me.

496
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,625
But I didn't say my last words.

497
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:57,916
You're not leaving here without me.

498
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,250
You know that, right?

499
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,125
You'd have to kidnap me.

500
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,083
That's a bad way to start over.

501
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:12,416
But it'd be hot.

502
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:16,166
I've learned
a few tricks about kidnappings.

503
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,625
How to tie people up… and all that.

504
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:24,125
Are you cutting steel or hitting on me?

505
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:30,500
I can do two things at once.

506
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:35,708
And I could do a third one.

507
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:45,541
You three,
get in the first vehicle! Move!

508
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:47,083
It's Helsinki.

509
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:49,625
There's movement outside.

510
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:52,583
The army's special ops.

511
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:54,750
They're loaded with every kind of weapon.

512
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:58,791
A C-90 rocket-launcher,
grenade launchers, machine guns, 

513
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:00,541
shotguns, rifles.

514
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:02,208
Come on, let's go!

515
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:06,958
They're getting in two LMVs.
Shit, immediate intervention!

516
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:12,791
Bogotá, Lisbon speaking.
Let Gandía go immediately.

517
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:17,500
He'll tell them
we're chasing the hostages.

518
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:19,500
If we don't, they'll break in now!

519
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:22,541
We don't have any weapons.
The hostages have taken the armory.

520
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:34,208
Hey! Cover me! All of you!

521
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,500
Fuck!

522
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:38,500
God!

523
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:46,208
God!

524
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:49,958
Denver!

525
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,583
I am Cincinnati's dad!

526
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,166
You fucking dick.

527
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,291
Come give me a kiss!

528
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:01,291
-Who's the father? I don't get it.
-Shut up or I'll staple your mouth shut.

529
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,375
Come here!

530
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:12,583
-Area secured.
-All clear.

531
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:15,041
-Get ready to intervene.
-Clear, Colonel.

532
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,875
Green light. We can proceed.

533
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:17,791
Now!

534
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:23,750
He's ready.

535
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,916
Come on.

536
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,625
Son of a bitch!

537
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:46,833
Arturito!

538
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:51,541
Do you believe in reincarnation?
If not, then you better negotiate, right?

539
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,291
Can you hold your breath?

540
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:58,708
For as long as it would take me
to fuck your mother up the ass.

541
00:40:00,416 --> 00:40:01,458
Is that enough?

542
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:13,416
It's fentanyl.

543
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,583
The doors are opening.

544
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,416
Let's see if this doesn't
knock you out either.

545
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:30,083
The hostages!

546
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:33,083
-What the fuck is that?
-The hostages are…

547
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:38,833
The hostages…

548
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:43,625
Abort the intervention!

549
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:48,625
The hostages are… 

550
00:40:58,291 --> 00:40:59,541
Confirmed, Colonel.

551
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:02,500
It's Gandía, Colonel. It's Gandía!

552
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:05,500
Sagasta, abort operation
until further notice.

553
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:14,333
The hostages…

554
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,750
Denver.

555
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:23,375
I know you're listening.
Do you think she loves you?

556
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,333
Denver?

557
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:27,666
No.

558
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:30,791
You're not man enough for her.

559
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:33,083
She used to tell me

560
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:35,708
I taught her what love is.

561
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:38,291
Did she ever
say anything like that to you? No.

562
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:40,333
Do you know why?

563
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:44,791
Because you lack the intelligence
to get where I got.

564
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:48,916
Your personal vendetta
is putting us all at risk!

565
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,833
Shut up!

566
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:56,125
I know that kid as if he were my own son.
I know where to scratch to rile him up.

567
00:41:56,791 --> 00:42:00,458
And that's what I'm going to do.
When he comes out, I'll scorch him.

568
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,625
With me…

569
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:11,375
she never wondered,
"What am I doing with this guy?"

570
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:13,041
Never.

571
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:14,583
And I was married.

572
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:16,625
And she knew.

573
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,458
But she couldn't leave my side
for a second.

574
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:23,375
Sparks flew between us

575
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,750
every time we ran into each other
by the coffee maker.

576
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:28,166
Give me your gun.

577
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,083
We were doing it all the time.

578
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:33,916
In every corner.

579
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:35,708
One year…

580
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:41,291
after another.

581
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:44,458
We made love everywhere, Denver.

582
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:49,833
It didn't matter
if we were under the printer,

583
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:52,500
in the cafeteria bathroom,

584
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:55,083
or in my office.

585
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:00,416
Or on the coin display cabinet.

586
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,000
It didn't matter.

587
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,541
And every night…

588
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:13,208
Every night, as soon as she got home,

589
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,375
she wrote me these beautiful texts,

590
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:19,208
sent me photos

591
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:24,250
and told me and promised me

592
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:27,500
she had never felt like that before
and couldn't live without me.

593
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,125
Denver,

594
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,833
has she ever told you anything like that?

595
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:35,000
I bet she hasn't.

596
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,958
-Give me the walkie-talkie.
-No.

597
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:39,958
Why didn't you have another child?
Your own child!

598
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:45,083
You stole her from me, you bastard!
You had to kidnap her!

599
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:48,708
And before she knew it,
she was in the middle of nowhere,

600
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:51,875
doomed to share her life with a bumpkin!

601
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:54,958
No, man, don't!

602
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:01,875
Come on!

603
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:03,458
Keep a cool head,

604
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:04,708
for fuck's sake!

605
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:12,625
Tokyo will be here
with the weapons any second now.

606
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,625
Keep your cool.

607
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:18,500
I'm sorry.

608
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,375
Weapons!

609
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:23,958
They have more weapons.

610
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,125
Fuck!

611
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:26,875
Change of plans!

612
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:28,625
You two, get those shields

613
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,833
and set up the Browning
on the forklift. Now!

614
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:40,083
There's no military logic
to abandoning our position.

615
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,583
Out there you have no chance.

616
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:51,250
Listen to me closely,
because I won't say this twice.

617
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:58,791
They're attacking us. And you heard them,
they have more weapons.

618
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:04,333
As soon as they bring them here,

619
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:07,166
this will become a rat trap
and they'll finish us off!

620
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:14,833
I told you, we need to strike!

621
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:19,166
Now!

622
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:27,416
Let's go.

623
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:36,250
They stopped covering the windows.
We can't wait any longer.

624
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,708
Attack quickly! Now!

625
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:52,500
-What the fuck is that?
-Back off!

626
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:54,000
Open!

627
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:04,541
Close!

628
00:46:13,041 --> 00:46:14,208
Open!

629
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:20,000
Last clip!

630
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,916
Close!

631
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:33,708
Open!

632
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,000
Shit!

633
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:39,208
We're out of ammo!

634
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,083
Arturo!

635
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:04,125
Mónica…

636
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,083
Calm down.

637
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:14,416
Move and I'll shoot him!

638
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,875
On your knees!

639
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:19,041
Come on, get down.

640
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:22,791
Don't do anything you'll regret.

641
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:25,875
Put the gun down, please.

642
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:32,416
But you won't shoot…

643
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:33,916
right?

644
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:36,291
You'd never shoot your son's dad.

645
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:38,708
Do you know how I know? 

646
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:44,833
I'll be the only one left to look after
that child when this is all over.

647
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:50,000
-The only one he won't be embarrassed by.
-Get down!

648
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:53,125
Don't you understand?

649
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,916
Don't you get it?

You'll never be one of them.

00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:11,125
You'll always be a secret--
