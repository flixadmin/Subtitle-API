1
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,560
How did it feel?

2
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,400
Taking a life...

3
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,280
for the first time?

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,880
How does it feel?

5
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,920
I'm sure you know.

6
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,520
It's been a long time.

7
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,560
I don't quite remember.

8
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,160
Tell me.

9
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,720
How are you feeling?

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,920
I feel like everyone's staring at me.

11
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,160
Everyone knows what I did.

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,680
I feel like something's stuck...

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,040
right here,

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,880
inside me.

15
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,960
And it's choking me.

16
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,080
Yes.

17
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,480
What have I done?

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,000
You'll do it again.

19
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,440
And again.

20
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah.

21
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,360
You're a natural.

22
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
Hello?!

23
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,560
Fernandez sir!

24
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,840
Please get me out of here, sir!

25
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,360
<i>I'm in trouble, sir!</i>

26
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,760
<i>Please get me out of here.</i>

27
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,040
Calm down, Bhumi.
What's going on?

28
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,000
I thought Nayak had called me.

29
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,680
That's the reason
I came here with a <i>Hijra.</i>

30
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't know...

31
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,160
I... I accidentally shot her, sir!

32
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Bhumi, listen to me.

33
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,160
Can you see anyone around you?

34
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,160
<i>Sir, there's a dead body, sir.</i>

35
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,280
<i>Is there anybody else?</i>

36
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,480
There was a driver here.

37
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
But he's not here right now.

38
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,840
Where are you?

39
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,120
-Can you describe the place?
<i>-I'm in a room, sir.</i>

40
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,280
Some old dilapidated room.

41
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
<i>There's a ton of scrap here.</i>

42
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,280
And the <i>Hijra's</i> corpse.

43
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,837
Bhumi, focus. Okay?

44
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,200
Check the area around the dead body.
Can you see any of your stuff around?

45
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,320
<i>You need to move it.</i>

46
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,600
<i>Phone, bag,</i>

47
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,800
and the gun!

48
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,120
<i>Take the gun, hide it,</i>

49
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,400
and just get out of there.

50
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,880
<i>Keep talking to me, Bhumi!</i>

51
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,880
I'm outside the building, sir.

52
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
<i>Keep walking, okay?</i>

53
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,880
And don't take the main road.
Use the alleys.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,440
<i>And walk slowly, Bhumi.</i>

55
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,720
<i>Control your pace.</i>

56
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,160
Send me your location.
I'm coming, okay?

57
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,200
Bhumi!

58
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,160
Bhumi!

59
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,320
It's me.

60
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,800
It's me. Are you okay?

61
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,320
Are you hurt?

62
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,680
This is not me, sir.

63
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,320
-This is not me.
-I know.

64
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,720
I know, Bhumi.

65
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,040
I thought Nayak was testing me.

66
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,200
I... I don't get it.

67
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,440
No, Bhumi, listen.

68
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,360
Everything's alright, okay?

69
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,480
Where's the gun?

70
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,960
Bhumi, where is the gun?
Do you have it?

71
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,720
Gun! Where is the gun?

72
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,080
It's in my bag, sir.

73
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,440
Bhumi.

74
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,720
You can use our room, okay?

75
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,960
No, I'll sleep here.

76
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,120
You'll feel better in there.

77
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,760
We'll sleep here.

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,920
No.

79
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,560
I'm filthy.

80
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,240
The floor is all I deserve.

81
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,960
I'll be alright here.

82
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,560
<i>This feeling that I have right now...</i>

83
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,440
it will eventually go away, right?

84
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,600
No, it won't.

85
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,680
But one gets used to it.

86
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,720
You'll get used to it as well.

87
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,120
In fact, you'll start enjoying it.

88
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,640
"I'll shoot you!"

89
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,120
Come on.

90
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,600
Wildfire in a jungle...

91
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,280
it always starts out small.

92
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,120
But it could destroy the
whole jungle if it's ignored.

93
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,320
When a tree catches fire,

94
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,600
it'll always burn the tree next to it.

95
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,000
Distance!

96
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,240
That's the reason it's
important to maintain distance.

97
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,160
Exactly!

98
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,040
I had to control the fire.

99
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,720
<i>My supply chain...</i>

100
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,600
<i>is spread all over the country.</i>

101
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,960
<i>Many people are involved.</i>

102
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,600
<i>But they only know the person...</i>

103
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,520
<i>before and after them in this chain.</i>

104
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,760
<i>That's all they know about this network.</i>

105
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,280
<i>But it's enough to burn my network down.</i>

106
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,640
<i>I had to stop it.</i>

107
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,960
<i>Which is exactly why, from time to time,</i>

108
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,880
<i>I need to chop off a few trees...</i>

109
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,160
<i>to stop the fire from burning
the whole jungle down.</i>

110
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,400
Cut him off.

111
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,120
Look!

112
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,120
Watching it will help you.

113
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,840
These are trees in my jungle.

114
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,720
The fire will get to me
if I don't chop these off.

115
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,960
Earlier, I used to do it myself.

116
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,880
But I don't have the time anymore.

117
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,120
When I watch this on a screen in a room...

118
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,080
it feels like a video game.

119
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,840
No one seems to be getting hurt.

120
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,280
No one seems to be dying.

121
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,080
That's the reason it's important to walk
out into the real world and feel it again.

122
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,800
I'm coming off as evil, right?

123
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,680
But you'll get what I mean.

124
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,840
And you will become like me.

125
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,000
No.

126
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,080
I don't think so.

127
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,680
I...

128
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,400
Why did I shoot her?

129
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,800
She would've shot you if you hadn't.

130
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,280
That was the plan.

131
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,280
What if the whore doesn't comply?

132
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,880
What if she doesn't rat on Nayak?

133
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,200
<i>Kill her regardless.</i>

134
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,600
<i>Or we'll kill you.</i>

135
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,760
<i>That's the order.</i>

136
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,560
Was she really gonna kill me?

137
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
Yes.

138
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,800
And that was your order?

139
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,160
One of you had to die.

140
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,200
You've seen my face.

141
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,560
And I wanted to test...

142
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,880
if you really have what it takes
to live with me.

143
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,600
But I was sure...

144
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,680
that you'll pass the test.

145
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,120
I was sure about it...

146
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,400
when I saw you for the first time.

147
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,560
I really like you.

148
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
And you like me as well.

149
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,680
But to be with a man like me...

150
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,480
it was necessary for you to
have killed a human being.

151
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,880
The feeling that you spoke about...

152
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,360
it was necessary for you to feel it.

153
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,520
Do you still wanna be with me?

154
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,120
One second.

155
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,800
-Sir?
<i>-Calling you early, Fernandez?</i>

156
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,520
No, sir. Tell me.

157
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,880
Bhumi has been missing
for ten hours, Fernandez.

158
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,000
Maybe Nayak has picked her up,
but we're not sure.

159
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,800
<i>You know the most
about this operation, so...</i>

160
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,080
What's her last known location, sir?

161
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,800
Last night, at her hotel room.

162
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,840
The police guard had
made a note of the time.

163
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,920
7:45 p.m.

164
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,280
Please hold off all forces, sir.

165
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,560
Local stations have no
training for such operations.

166
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,600
I'm going to her hotel. Alone.

167
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,760
Please keep this information
only to the core team, sir.

168
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,680
<i>Sure.</i>

169
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,360
<i>It has to be done fast, Fernandez.</i>

170
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,800
Yes, sir. Thank you.

171
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,440
I'll call you.

172
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,560
HOW ARE YOU, MOM?

173
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,080
MOM - I'M ALRIGHT.
HOW ARE YOU?

174
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,760
I'M OKAY

175
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,440
WHERE ARE YOU?

176
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,640
THE WORK HAS BEGUN.

177
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,760
Sir, the message says,
"The work has begun."

178
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,480
I think that means
Nayak's operation is on, sir.

179
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,600
Sounds far-fetched, Fernandez.

180
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,800
Sir, I'll try another message.

181
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,280
IS THE WORK ON ROUND THE CLOCK?

182
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,280
NOT SURE.

183
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,760
I like it...

184
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,440
when you look at me.

185
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,520
You were watching me, right?

186
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,560
For the past month?

187
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,520
Through this.

188
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,680
Here's your stuff.

189
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,160
<i>I told him I'm a cop.</i>

190
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,680
<i>I told him I'd work for him.</i>

191
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,560
<i>Be his mole in the police department.</i>

192
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,360
I saw Sasya there, sir.

193
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,440
I met him.

194
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,400
<i>He's working with Nayak again.</i>

195
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,920
Are you watching me, Nayak?

196
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,760
<i>Can you see me?</i>

197
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,240
<i>Why don't you reach out
to me if you're watching?</i>

198
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,400
I was watching you every day.

199
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,600
IS THE WORK ON ROUND THE CLOCK?

200
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,040
Your mother is really worried about you.

201
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,120
Well, she's using a new phone.

202
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,160
She's just learning how to text.

203
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,600
The recording stops...

204
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,680
when you're with me.

205
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,000
There are no photos or videos of Nayak.

206
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
The statement you gave to the police...

207
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,880
Sugar?

208
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,560
Yeah.

209
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,400
It told me that...

210
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,240
you're on my side.

211
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,520
Why didn't you call me earlier?

212
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,320
If I would've called you...

213
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,760
many chapters of your story
wouldn't have begun.

214
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,840
Please...

215
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,360
forgive me!

216
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,640
Have a seat.

217
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,720
Please.

218
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,600
What the hell is going on?

219
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,440
We wanna join you.

220
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,880
All of us.

221
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,640
We wanna stop paying these asshole pimps...

222
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,600
just like you.

223
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,800
We want you to support us.

224
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,800
How can I support you?

225
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,360
Yes, you can.

226
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,960
Tipu told us...

227
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,640
what you did to him.

228
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,600
Yeah, I told them.

229
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,760
I'm not here to support anyone.

230
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,760
I'm just gonna look after myself.

231
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,800
And him?

232
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,640
Standing here with his
cock between his legs?

233
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,720
Do you remember how he
hit thrashed me that night?

234
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,640
But...

235
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,560
And you just stood there and watched!

236
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,400
No one's here to support anyone.

237
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,400
Forget about it.

238
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,280
Don't risk your lives.

239
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,680
Just do what you're doing.

240
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,320
Hey!

241
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,320
Do you think we aren't
already risking our lives?

242
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,360
STDs, pregnancy, violence,

243
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,040
the bloody cops as well.

244
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,560
We risk our lives every second we breathe!

245
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,920
We don't mind the risk!

246
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,120
We don't!

247
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,120
We'll become our own pimps!

248
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,120
No one can touch us if we're all together!

249
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,280
Wow!

250
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,800
What a speech!

251
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,160
That was powerful!

252
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,560
-That was powerful.
-Mary, just shut up!

253
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,720
You guys are gonna kill it!

254
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,360
-You are gonna smash the system!
-Hey, auntie!

255
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,240
This is none of your business.

256
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,240
Why the hell is he here?

257
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,600
Well, I'll be your manager!

258
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,960
Attendant.

259
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,000
Your house, your rent,
your groceries, your appointments,

260
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,360
I'll handle it professionally!

261
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,800
-I'll handle the planning!
-Planning!

262
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,760
You fucking whores have lost your minds!

263
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,760
Hey, auntie, has anyone bothered
to fuck you for the past three years?

264
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,920
We're talking about call girls here.

265
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,080
We don't need scrap dealers!

266
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,000
Get lost!

267
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
Come on. Scram!

268
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,760
Fucking whore!

269
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,760
You're gonna be just like me one day!

270
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,480
Remember!

271
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,640
No one's gonna sleep with you
even if you offer to do it for free!

272
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
And you!

273
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,440
You look like a skinny lizard right now!

274
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,400
I don't think men like lizards!

275
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,600
-Hey, Mary! Shut up!
-Stop!

276
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,160
You really think
she's gonna be your savior?

277
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,320
Who is she?

278
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,640
You'll find out when you're
in a stable with the buffaloes!

279
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,560
Shut up!

280
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,000
She'll protect you for two flowery days.

281
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,120
What are you gonna do
if she fucks off for good?

282
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,280
Mary, just leave!
Get the fuck out of here!

283
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,480
She's right.

284
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,480
Do whatever you wanna do
if you have the power to do it.

285
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,560
Who the hell am I?

286
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,960
I saw a lot more.

287
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,760
What?

288
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,280
Everything.

289
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,280
Every single thing.

290
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,080
You don't have to pay to watch.

291
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,520
It's free.

292
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,560
You can touch me...

293
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,600
<i>if you wanna do it.</i>

294
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,080
That's free as well.

295
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
Sorry.

296
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,760
Why?

297
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,920
You didn't like it, right?

298
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,440
Maybe I did.

299
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,640
Need a room.

300
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,120
Stop.

301
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
You'll have to pay if you wanna proceed.

302
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,680
What?

303
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,640
That's my rule.

304
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,400
Alright.

305
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,760
How much do you want?

306
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,320
You're gonna break your rule?

307
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,800
For me?

308
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,920
Tell me!

309
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,960
I wanna hear you say it.

310
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,000
Say it.

311
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,760
Yes.

312
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,400
I'm breaking my rule...

313
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,520
for you.

314
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
Tell me.

315
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,920
How much?

316
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,200
It really didn't bother you?

317
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,080
Does the fact that it didn't bother me...

318
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,200
bother you?

319
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,640
No.

320
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,120
I'm feeling really free right now.

321
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,400
Wow!

322
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,240
One should feel free, Bhumi.

323
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,840
It's really important.

324
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,360
<i>Chinnanna.</i>

325
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,480
<i>My uncle.</i>

326
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,520
He was having an affair with my mother.

327
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
<i>I used to love thinking...</i>

328
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,080
<i>that maybe I was Chinanna's son.</i>

329
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,480
<i>I really loved them.</i>

330
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,280
But they weren't free.

331
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,160
<i>They used to meet secretly.</i>

332
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,840
<i>They were scared.</i>

333
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,080
I used to think...

334
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,600
why must a man or a woman
sleep with just one person?

335
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,160
What's the big deal?

336
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,640
If it wasn't a big deal...

337
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,680
my life wouldn't be so messed up.

338
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,480
Forcing a person kills trust.

339
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,120
A man and a woman...

340
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,440
their minds should be connected.

341
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,960
Their bodies don't matter.

342
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,200
You're here right now.

343
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,680
With me.

344
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,280
You're completely here.

345
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,560
Free.

346
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,160
That is all I want.

347
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,360
Everything else is irrelevant.

348
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,120
Bhumi was last spotted at 7:45 p.m.

349
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
as reported by the
constable who was on duty.

350
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,600
From today morning onwards,
she went missing.

351
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,000
We do not have any information
about her whereabouts.

352
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,040
-Leena, are the ground units ready?
-Sir?

353
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,840
Sir, I'll get it
double-checked immediately.

354
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,720
So, guys, just note that...

355
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,600
-Bhumi?
-Yes, sir.

356
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,160
There's a mention of today's date.

357
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,440
-What are these numbers?
-I have no idea, sir.

358
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,880
21,2787,

359
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,560
81,8661,

360
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,080
2365130.

361
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,000
Sir, the system isn't able
to recognize these codes.

362
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,760
-Reverse these variables and try again.
-Okay.

363
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,600
-Nambiar!
-Sir?

364
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,880
She's sent more numbers.
I've sent it to you.

365
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,840
Yes, sir.

366
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,040
Please tell me we're getting
somewhere with this, man.

367
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,520
We're trying all the combinations, sir.

368
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,120
Phone numbers, bank account numbers,

369
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
PAN card numbers,
alphanumerics, everything.

370
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,640
Still no match, sir.

371
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,680
This shouldn't be that difficult.

372
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,040
There's a map in every picture.

373
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,960
There's a map.

374
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,880
What do they need for this transit?

375
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,920
Location! We have here two-digit numbers

376
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,280
with decimal points
then a four-digit number.

377
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,920
Two of them...
Could be one...

378
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,040
Vehicle! Vehicle number!

379
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,480
Highway! Highway number!

380
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,040
Then... Two digits...

381
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,880
Could be a sub-route!

382
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,800
Sir, please come here!

383
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,760
Sir, first part...

384
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,640
location coordinates.

385
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,360
Everybody, come here. Come!

386
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,520
Sir, after that...

387
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,480
vehicle number.

388
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,400
Next...

389
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,160
highway number.

390
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,480
And next...

391
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,880
sub-route.

392
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,760
-Check!
-So, maybe, we're on to something.

393
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,400
-Sir?
-Fernandez.

394
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,720
Our next move will be really critical.

395
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Yes, sir.

396
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,680
Will you command it?

397
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,680
Unofficially?

398
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Of course, sir.

399
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,840
Sir!

400
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,400
We've spotted three vehicles at
the check posts at the locations.

401
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,120
-Number plates match.
-Sir!

402
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,680
Two more vehicles.

403
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,360
Total five, sir.

404
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,000
Sir, three more!

405
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,440
Leena!

406
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,760
Divide the decoded locations into zones.

407
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,160
Alert all the ground units.

408
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,920
We need to dispatch them
to the nearest locations.

409
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,240
-Put everything on the live feed.
-Yes, sir.

410
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,720
Sir?

411
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,840
Okay, listen to me carefully.

412
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,120
You just need to secure
the locations right now.

413
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,120
-You have to wait for my command.
-Copy, sir.

414
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,600
And good to have you back, sir.

415
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,680
Unofficially.

416
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,760
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

417
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,920
Now that's a definite lead from our asset...

418
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,560
which may take us close
to the target very soon.

419
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Yes, Fernandez?

420
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,360
All locations are covered, sir.

421
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,040
<i>Great.</i>

422
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,240
But we can't raid them right now, sir.

423
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,840
Nayak will find out how
the coordinates have leaked.

424
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,520
And Bhumi is with him.

425
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,280
MOM - YOU SHOULD COME HOME

426
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,000
What's your mother saying right now?

427
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,680
She's asking me when I'll be back home.

428
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,040
Tell her...

429
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,760
duty always comes first.

430
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,080
Perimeter secured, sir.

431
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,360
<i>Copy that.</i>

432
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,560
Are we going ahead?

433
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,502
Stand by.

434
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,600
Follow the vehicles.

435
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,680
And report their final locations.

436
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,040
Ready to strike, sir.

437
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,360
Maintain position.

438
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,640
<i>Strike canceled.</i>

439
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,760
<i>Maintain positions for now.</i>

440
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,760
I repeat.

441
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,752
Strike canceled.

442
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,560
Sir, it's not just about Bhumi.

443
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,160
But... do seven-eight trucks
and a couple of warehouses really matter?

444
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,600
Would it really affect Nayak?

445
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,600
Sir, I believe that Bhumi is
on to something bigger here.

446
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,320
We should wait for her.

447
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,680
Yeah, well, maybe.

448
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,480
But as soon as you
have an update on Bhumi...

449
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,640
let me know.

450
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,280
Yes, sir.

451
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,520
Fuck.

452
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,440
Hello, Aai!

453
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,200
Lokhande, come in.

454
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,800
How are you?

455
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,680
Well, what can I say?

456
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,760
Where is she?

457
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,320
She's outside.

458
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,080
She hasn't come home
for a couple of days.

459
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,640
Why?

460
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,080
Has she found a new boyfriend?

461
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,840
What are you saying?

462
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,880
Duty.

463
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,160
She's been working
round the clock these days.

464
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,320
What?

465
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,560
When did Rupa start working?

466
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,600
No, not Rupa.

467
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,880
I thought you were asking about Bhumi.

468
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,600
Why would I ask you about Sir?

469
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,200
I know everything about her.

470
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,480
I'm not interested in here anymore.

471
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,280
And you know what I'm interested in.

472
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,120
How dare you say that about Rupa?

473
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,600
Bhumi and you aren't divorced yet.

474
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,360
And you're already talking
about second marriage?

475
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,760
Aai, I've already gotten married once.

476
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,680
I'm not interested in
marrying dozens of women.

477
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,160
What?

478
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,680
Come on.

479
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,960
Aai, listen to me.

480
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,760
A man and a woman...

481
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,040
they can do many things together.

482
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,200
Why must they get married to do it?

483
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,200
You must have an open mind, Aai.

484
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,560
Open up your mind!

485
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,680
You want the apartment back, right?

486
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,760
I'll give it back!

487
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,960
Of course, I will!

488
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,400
That is exactly
what I wanted to talk about.

489
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,640
Listen to me.

490
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,640
Just ask Rupa to pay me
a visit at the apartment.

491
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,680
Alone.

492
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,200
We'll spend some time together.

493
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,800
And I'll give you the apartment!

494
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,880
Why wouldn't I, Aai?

495
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,600
I'm a member of this family!

496
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,800
What's wrong, Mom?

497
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,480
What's wrong?

498
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,840
Lokhande, the bastard, was here.

499
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,160
Do you know what he said?

500
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,760
He reminded me of
how alone I really am!

501
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,360
Of how weak I am!

502
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,080
Any damn loser can screw over women...

503
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,960
who don't have a man to protect them!

504
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,960
What happened?

505
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,920
He walked into my house,

506
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,200
and made a deal about my daughter!

507
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,640
How dare he say those filthy things!

508
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,760
And I didn't stop him!

509
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,800
I couldn't stop him.

510
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,800
I can't look after you two anymore.

511
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,320
I can't do it. I'm done!

512
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,520
She's the one who should've
stopped him a long time ago!

513
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,360
She's the one who's weak!

514
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,040
I'll deal with him today.

515
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,920
I am gonna end it!

516
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,960
Come with me!

517
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Wait here.

518
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,720
What the hell, Lokhande?!

519
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,640
How dare you say those things about Rupa?!

520
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,920
Talk to me!

521
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,880
Why?

522
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,760
What am I gonna get by talking to you?

523
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,520
I've already seen
everything you have to offer.

524
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,880
Let me know if you've grown
something new down there.

525
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,760
Come on! Have you grown
something new down there?!

526
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,800
Do you really think you've
got anything that I'd like?

527
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,080
Do you?

528
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,080
No, you're just the same.

529
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,960
The same manly body.

530
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,920
Damn.

531
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,320
But Rupa has it!

532
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,360
Rupa has what I want!

533
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,040
And you're lucky she does.

534
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,680
And we'll talk about the
apartment only after I get it.

535
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,240
What the hell is going on?!

536
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,160
Hey, Rupa!

537
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,320
Come on, Sir!
Why didn't you tell me Rupa's here?

538
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,440
What the hell is going on?

539
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,560
You really do have it, Rupa!

540
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,160
Come on, let's talk.

541
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,400
Privately.

542
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,960
Private?

543
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,760
What's private?

544
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,040
Come on! I spoke to Aai about it!

545
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,000
She's sent you here, right?

546
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,680
How dare you talk to her like that?

547
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,600
I'll tell you.

548
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,840
Come on, have a seat.

549
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,920
Come on.

550
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,520
We can talk about it.

551
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,520
Bloody pervert!

552
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,080
Hey!

553
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,840
What are you staring at?

554
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,240
Come on.

555
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
Come on.

556
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,160
Rupa!

557
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,200
Are you just gonna lie
there like a bloody corpse?!

558
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,000
You're colder than a bloody corpse!

559
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,400
<i>You'll turn me into a wimp as well!</i>

560
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,160
Get lost!

561
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,600
I can't talk to you right now.

562
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,600
Amey!

563
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,280
I want to meet you.

564
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,280
Please, Amey.

565
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,600
I wanna meet you right now!

566
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,960
I'll call you later, okay?

567
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,120
Bye.

568
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,040
Hello?

569
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,720
Stop calling me, Bhumi!
I told you I'll call you later, right?

570
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,760
Bye, bye!

571
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,720
-Hi!
-Hi!

572
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,800
Let's go?

573
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,760
Okay.

574
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,080
Hello, Amey.

575
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,280
Amey!

576
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,280
I wanna meet you right now!

577
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,400
It's really important, Amey!

578
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,440
If you really like me...

579
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,280
and if you wanna meet me,

580
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,240
just get up right now and leave!

581
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,600
Meet me at the hotel!
I'll be there.

582
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,560
<i>I told you, I can't come right now.</i>

583
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,760
<i>Please try and understand.</i>

584
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,680
<i>I'll call you back tomorrow when I'm free.</i>

585
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,240
What?

586
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,440
Grab the keys.

587
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,400
Why are you teasing me, man?

588
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,080
Come on.

589
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,320
Oh, come on!

590
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,240
Why are you rubbing salt on my wounds?

591
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,280
Are you having fun doing that?

592
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,640
What the fuck!

593
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,200
But I know it's just
gonna be a warm-up.

594
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,960
I know it.

595
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,440
Are you sure?

596
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,640
I know you.

597
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,280
Right now, even I don't know myself.
