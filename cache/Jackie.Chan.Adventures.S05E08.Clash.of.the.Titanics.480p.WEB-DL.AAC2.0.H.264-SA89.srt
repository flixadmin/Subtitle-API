1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,703
Uncle: Ah...Ah...Ah...

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,171
(Sneezes)

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,906
Jackie!

4
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,441
Jackie: Yes, uncle.

5
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,844
Uncle: More hot tea, please!

6
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:15,080
Jackie: Yes, uncle.
I have already put
the kettle on.

7
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:17,883
Uncle: One more thing...
(Sniffles)

8
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:20,753
Uncle's toes are chilly!

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,826
One more thing!

10
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:32,498
Uncle needs more cold
and flu season garlic!

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,634
Jackie, groaning:
Ohh...More garlic?

12
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,706
(Kettle whistles)

13
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,908
Uncle: Jackie!
I hear water boiling!

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,676
What is hold-up?

15
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:47,479
Jackie: I am getting
your garlic, uncle.

16
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,714
Jade, perhaps you could--

17
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,115
Jade: Sorry, uncle Jackie.

18
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:53,519
Love to help, but I gotta
take care of the customers.

19
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:57,656
Tohru!

20
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:01,226
(Humming,
music in headphones)

21
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,198
Uncle: Jackieeee!

22
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,767
Jackie: Coming, uncle!

23
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,003
Ah...Uh...Aah!

24
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,542
(Sighs) Here you are, uncle.

25
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,745
Is there anything else
you need?

26
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,680
Uncle: Yes. Rest.

27
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,015
(Jackie exhales)

28
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:25,284
Stop making noise!

29
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,752
(Ding-ding-ding-ding)

30
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,320
One more thing.

31
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,189
Jackie: Yes, uncle?

32
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:33,459
Uncle: Another demon power
has been released.

33
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,663
Jade: Cool!

34
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:40,933
Uncle: Aaiii-yaahh!

35
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:44,002
It is tchangzu,
the thunder demon,

36
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:48,173
defeated in ancient times
by magic castanets.

37
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,808
Jade: Castanets, huh?

38
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,544
Sounds like a road trip.
Spain, Mexico?

39
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,546
Jackie: The bottom
of the ocean.

40
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,782
It is a sunken ship.

41
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,417
And there are letters
on the hull.

42
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:00,919
Jade: A-n-I-c.

43
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:05,457
Whoa! The castanets went
down with...The <i> Titanic!</i>

44
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,894
Jade: What do you mean,
it's not the <i> Titanic?</i>
Àthe name on the hull--

45
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:44,863
black: Ends with a-n-I-c.

46
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,365
It's the <i> oceanic.</i>

47
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:49,001
Sank in the arctic waters
in 1932.

48
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:51,036
According to the passenger
manifest,

49
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:53,906
there was a troop
- of flamenco dancers on board.

50
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:56,208
No doubt used the castanets
in their act.

51
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,577
Jade: The <i> Titanic, oceanic.</i>
Àpotato, pot-ahto.

52
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,280
It's still deep-sea salvage,
and that is mondo coolio!

53
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:04,016
Jackie: It is
mondo dangerous, Jade.

54
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:07,419
The ship sits at the bottom
of an icy ocean.

55
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,856
Black: Fortunately, section 13
has a new submersible vehicle,

56
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:14,826
especially designed for...
(Sniffs)

57
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:17,829
What is that odor?
Smells like...

58
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,798
(Jackie sniffs)

59
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,467
Jackie: Uncle.

60
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,903
Tohru: I pleaded with <i> sensei</i>
àto stay in bed,

61
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,672
but he would not listen.

62
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:30,842
Uncle: Uncle is needed.
Demon chi is very powerful.

63
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,212
Black: Oh! So is that garlic.

64
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,616
Strikemaster ice:
Y'all ready to shred?

65
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:41,286
Mc cobra: Tahoe is gonna be
off the hook! Yeah!

66
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:45,123
Drago: And where do you
three snow bunnies
think you're off to?

67
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,695
Strikemaster ice: Gonna bust a
move on some fresh
powder, dawg.

68
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:52,864
Drago: Wrong answer...Dawg.

69
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:53,966
All three: Yo!

70
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,906
Strikemaster ice:
A'ight. I feel ya, d.

71
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,175
You vibin' on some new
demon chi?

72
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:05,577
Drago: Big time.
The power of thunder,

73
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,780
contained in a pair
of immortal castanets.

74
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,749
Strikemaster ice:
Castanets, huh? Ole!

75
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,718
So where they gonna
be at--cabo?

76
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,722
Mc cobra: Sweet! Yeah.
We could catch some
primo rays.

77
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:19,091
Drago: The castanets
are under water.

78
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,994
(Shudders) Not exactly
my cup of chi.

79
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,929
Strikemaster ice:
Why you say that, d.?

80
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,931
don't tell me you're scared
of a little surf.

81
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,899
Drago: Scared? No.

82
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,068
I just dislike
being under water

83
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,938
because then I can't <i> do this!</i>

84
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,542
Just because I won't
be going on this little
sea hunt

85
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,711
doesn't mean you three can't.

86
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,947
You'll need a submarine.

87
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,983
Strikemaster ice: A sub?
See, now, that's kinda
tricky, yo.

88
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,352
Mc cobra: Not like
we're gonna find one

89
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,354
with the key still
in the ignition.

90
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,759
Strikemaster ice: Yo, ho, ho!
Hold up, chief!

91
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:56,561
My boy dj fist's
got a bright one.

92
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:58,964
Jade: Whoa!

93
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,166
That is one kean-o
submarine-o.

94
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,368
Black: Section 13's
newest prototype.

95
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,904
Able to withstand
3,000 tons of pressure,

96
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:09,074
lateral maneuverability,
retractable pincer arms.

97
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,109
Jade: Well, what are you
landlubbers waiting for?

98
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,978
Let's shape up and ship out.

99
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,080
Jackie: You are not
going, Jade.

100
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:18,784
Jade: Jackie! I saw the movie
<i>Titanic</i> 12 times!

101
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:21,520
That makes me a total expert
on sunken treasure.

102
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:23,388
Uncle: Jade must listen
to Jackie.

103
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,791
You cannot go on sub
with us!

104
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,793
Jackie: And neither
can you, uncle.

105
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,361
Not with your cold.

106
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:32,331
All those germs in
a tiny, enclosed space...

107
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,732
Ow!

108
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,935
Uncle: Uncle is not
infectious! Ah-choo!

109
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:40,672
And you cannot perform
removal spell yourself!

110
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,741
Jackie: I realize that, uncle.

111
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:45,410
But tohru and I can retrieve
the castanets,

112
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:49,815
and you can perform
the removal spell later
on dry land.

113
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:50,916
Black: Makes sense.

114
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,818
Uncle and Jade: Ohh...

115
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:55,921
Drago: Well?

116
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,522
Strikemaster ice:
It's all good, dawg.

117
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,924
We got everything we need.

118
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,726
Drago: You have
a submarine in there?

119
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,394
Strikemaster ice:
Naw, we got tools.

120
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,730
Cobra and fist
gonna build you one.

121
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:07,766
Drago: I wouldn't trust
those two to mow my lawn!

122
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,736
(Clanking, drilling)

123
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:13,605
Strikemaster ice: Word up, d.
These two got mad skills!

124
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,807
Drago: They're gonna have
mad scars if--

125
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,243
mc cobra: Somebody order
a sub?

126
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:28,186
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, that is one sweet ride.

127
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:32,257
Come on, d. Give my boys
some props!

128
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,659
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, got it. Keepin' it
low-key.

129
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,832
Black: All right, Jackie.

130
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,001
Brace yourselves
for splashdown.

131
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,471
Jackie: Balance, tohru.

132
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,414
Tohru: Jackie?

133
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,282
Jackie, muffled: Ohh...

134
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,051
Are we there yet?

135
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,362
Maintain course, tohru.

136
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,834
I believe the <i> oceanic</i>
àis directly below us.

137
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,469
(Sniff, sniff)

138
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,171
What is that odor?

139
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:20,839
(Sniff, sniff)

140
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,274
Jade: Hi, Jackie.

141
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:23,475
Jackie: Jade...

142
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:26,411
Jade: I know, I know.
Too dangerous.

143
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:29,281
But you need me, uncle Jackie.

144
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,783
Ok, fine. I'll leave.

145
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,051
Jackie: Very funny!

146
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,854
We are 20,000 leagues
under the sea, and--

147
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,189
(sniff, sniff)

148
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:39,991
Oh! Why do you smell
like garlic?

149
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,860
Jade: Not me.

150
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,995
It's coming from...

151
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,398
Uncle: Hi, Jackie.

152
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,866
Jackie: Uncle!

153
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,401
Jade: Great minds
think alike.

154
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:51,336
Uncle: Wipe sourpuss
off face!

155
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,472
Uncle is not infectious!

156
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:58,477
Now get uncle a blanket.
It's freezing in sub!

157
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,412
Strikemaster ice:
- Drop-zone dead ahead, homies.

158
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:04,683
Yo, fist, drago say
east or west of the glacier?

159
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:18,296
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, we don't ski
till we get the chi.

160
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,298
You feel me?

161
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,340
Jackie: Tohru,
you must drive more carefully!

162
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,342
Tohru: I do not understand.

163
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,444
There are no rock formations
in this area.

164
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,112
Jade: Uh, Jackie?

165
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,082
Uncle: Aiiii-yaaaah!

166
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,351
Giant crab monster!

167
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,754
Jade: I never thought
I'd be on this end
of a submarine sandwich.

168
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,301
Jade: Oh, uncle!
Isn't there some kind of

169
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,370
"crab be gone" mojo
you can do?

170
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:02,707
Uncle: Magic must defeat
magic, not overgrown
shellfish!

171
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,543
Jackie: You are right, uncle!

172
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,816
Crab must defeat crab!

173
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,629
(Jackie, uncle, tohru,
Jade yelling)

174
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,767
(Lobster screeches)

175
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:33,004
Tohru: Oh...I fear we are
only making him angrier.

176
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,945
Jade: Let's see how you do
against a video game pro.

177
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:43,381
Hang right, crew.
We're about to experience
a little turbulence!

178
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,287
(Screeches)

179
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,528
Make a wish.

180
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,305
Yes! He's crab cakes now!

181
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,341
Uncle: Aiii-yaaah!

182
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,643
Jackie gasps:
It is the <i> oceanic!</i>

183
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,714
Jade: Come on, slowpoke.

184
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:18,984
Jackie: Jade, you are
staying inside the sub.

185
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,318
Jade: Ohh...

186
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,886
Jackie: It is an enormous
ship.

187
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:25,323
Finding the castanets
among the wreckage
will not be easy.

188
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,359
Uncle: So use chi-o-matic!

189
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,460
Jackie: Under water?

190
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:31,363
Uncle: Baggie
seals in freshness.

191
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:45,176
(Metal creaks, shifts)

192
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,049
Jackie: Ow!

193
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:34,886
But uncle, we found
the immortal castanets!

194
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:39,057
Uncle: Yes. And chi-o-matic is
soaked like overcooked noodle!

195
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:42,494
Cannot do removal spell
until it is dry!
(Sub engine struggles)

196
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:45,230
Tohru: I believe we may have
a bigger problem, <i> sensei.</i>

197
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:48,700
Uncle: I know! Uncle
is running out of garlic!

198
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:53,304
Tohru: No. I'm afraid
our submarine is not
rising to the surface.

199
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,808
Jackie: Hmm. It must have
been damaged by the
giant crab.

200
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,611
We will have to jettison
some weight.

201
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:03,782
Tohru: I'm sorry. I am not
a very good swimmer.

202
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,784
Jade: No prob. I'll go.

203
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:08,186
Jackie: No, you will
not, Jade.

204
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,387
I will go.

205
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,890
Jade: Fine! But only
because you weigh more--

206
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,458
a lot more! A whole lot--

207
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,793
uncle: Jackie!

208
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:18,496
Do not surface too quickly
or you will get the bends.

209
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,899
Jade: He gets a German
luxury car?

210
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,101
Jackie: No, Jade.
The bends is a condition

211
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:26,037
that occurs when a diver
rises too quickly.

212
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,340
Tohru: I have heard
that the pressure change
can cause wooziness,

213
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,609
delirium, or worse.

214
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:35,313
Jackie: Yes. I will swim
very, very slowly.

215
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,854
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, peep this, dawgs.

216
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,522
The man with the castanets.

217
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:49,027
After we get them clackers,
we can leave chan to sleep
with the fishes.

218
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:09,247
Mc cobra: Oh, that's whacked.
You lost him, bro!

219
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:12,116
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, chan must have
booked for the surface.

220
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:15,286
But it's all good.
We'll be waitin'.

221
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,535
Jade gasps: Jackie!

222
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,270
Uncle: Aaiii-yaah!

223
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,739
Uncle told him
not to swim quickly!

224
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:38,109
Nephew never listens.

225
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,347
(Jackie grunts)

226
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:48,152
Luckily, I avoided
betting the gends.

227
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,154
I--hee hee hee!

228
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,190
I mean I--ooh!

229
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:55,793
Ground is all wobbly
like pudding!

230
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,996
I like tapioca.

231
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:01,132
Jade: Ooh! Can't this crate
move any faster?

232
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,967
Tohru: Unfortunately, no.

233
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,136
Uncle: Jackie can
take care of himself.

234
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:08,973
Right now, it is uncle
who needs help.

235
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:13,077
Chi-o-matic must be bone-dry
to operate properly.

236
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,213
Tohru: Perhaps you can
use this.

237
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:18,016
Jade: You brought a hair dryer
on a deep-sea mission?

238
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:20,285
Tohru: Ocean air
gives me the frizzies.

239
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,789
Strikemaster ice:
Let's do some thrashin'!

240
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,229
Jackie: Hello, neighbors.
Nice day.

241
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:32,730
Strikemaster ice: Oh, yeah!

242
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,667
Nice day to bust open
a can of whoop-chan!

243
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,340
Jackie: Oh, pretty!

244
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,609
You made a snow angel.

245
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,844
Strikemaster ice: Get him, yo!

246
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,686
Jackie: We play Patty cake?

247
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:57,288
Strikemaster ice:
All right, fool.
Enough reindeer games.

248
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,957
Hand over the castanets.

249
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,160
Jackie: Cast a net?
Oh! We go fishing?

250
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,962
I like fishies!

251
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,763
Strikemaster ice:
- Chan, you feelin' all right?

252
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,198
Jackie: Peachy keen.

253
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,369
Jade: Come on!
We gotta find Jackie!

254
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,971
Uncle: Uncle will stay here,

255
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,907
finish styling
chi-o-matic.

256
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,777
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, got me a burnin' desire

257
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,045
for those castanets, chan.

258
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,581
Jackie: Ooh! Pretty fireworks.

259
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,883
Is it Chinese new year
already?

260
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,456
Jade: Didn't anyone ever
tell you smoking's bad
for your health?

261
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,491
Strikemaster ice:
Shrimp, you headed
for the Barbie.

262
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,129
Jackie: Oh ho!
We play freeze tag?

263
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,000
You are it.

264
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,473
Jade: Avalanche,
comin' at ya.

265
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,646
Tohru: Jackie,
are you all right?

266
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,783
Jackie: Yes, but you two
are very wobbly.

267
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,385
Wobbly is a funny word.

268
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,420
Rhymes with gobbly. Hee he.

269
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:04,222
Jade: He has so
got the bends.

270
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,824
Jackie: I do?
What a nice car!

271
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,860
Yay for me!

272
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:12,263
Oh! Hello again, buddy!

273
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,968
Jade: Charge!

274
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,040
Uncle: <i> Yu mo guai guey</i>
à <i> fi Dee tsao...</i>

275
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,241
Ah-choo!

276
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,710
<i>Yu mo guai guey</i>
à <i> fi de tsao...</i>

277
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,082
Drago: Crunchy metal outside,

278
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:34,485
gooey chi filling inside.

279
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:38,623
Uncle: You want
a piece of uncle?

280
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:42,427
Drago: Gonna be several pieces
of uncle when I'm through!

281
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:43,995
Uncle: Eeeeaaaaah!

282
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:47,932
Jackie: Hee hee!
Look at the flying old man!

283
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,939
Jade: Climb aboard, t.
I'll steer.

284
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,274
Tohru: We're coming, <i> sensei.</i>

285
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:59,510
Uncle: Take your time!
No hurry.

286
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,417
Jackie: Wheeee!

287
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,219
(Drago growls)

288
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,823
Drago: Anyone up for
some flame-enco dancing?

289
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,929
And now,
for the main attraction...

290
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,730
Uncle: Aiii-yaah!

291
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:22,567
Drago is absorbing
power of tchangzu,

292
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,569
the thunder demon!

293
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,104
Jackie: Ooh! Pretty.

294
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,480
Drago, as Elvis: Tchangzu.
Tchangzu very much.

295
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:39,117
And don't even think
about following me.

296
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,989
Much as I'd love to stay
and chill,

297
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,358
I'll leave that to you.

298
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,903
Jackie: A skating rink. Fun!

299
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,338
Jade: Well, this
turned out well.

300
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,073
Drago gets the thunder power,

301
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:05,510
we're stuck in the middle
of the ocean on a melting
chunk of ice...

302
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:08,980
(Sniffs) And somebody
<i>so</i> needs a breath mint!

303
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,749
Tohru: And it appears
that a storm is brewing.

304
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,721
Black: Need a lift?

305
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:19,190
Jackie: Whirly-birdy!

306
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,494
Black: Jackie has
a bad case of the bends.

307
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,963
Needs to decompress
for 48 hours.

308
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,365
Same for uncle.

309
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,767
Uncle: Let uncle out!

310
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,003
Jade: Poor guy.
Totally delusional.

311
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,005
Tohru: I do not
understand, Jade.

312
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:37,608
Why did you tell captain black
that <i> sensei</i> had the bends?

313
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,345
Jade: You kidding?
That garlic smell
was making me gag!

314
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,347
I figure, 2 days
in solitary,

315
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,550
good-bye, major stink.

316
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:50,354
Uncle: Let uncle out!
Aaiiii-yaaah!

317
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,791
Jackie: I hear knock-knock.
Who's there?

318
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,727
Hee hee.
I like monkeys.

319
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,196
And wax lips.

320
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,998
This is a nice phone booth.

321
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,203
Ooh, look, I can make
funny sounds with
my underarms!

322
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:08,239
Hee hee hee hee!
Oop--'scuse me.

323
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,780
Jade: Hey, Jackie, do you like
to surf the web?

324
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:18,449
Jackie: I want to surf
something I want to surf.

325
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,451
I'm not like...

326
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:23,187
How do you say?
Surf the whole day.

327
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:27,458
Lotta people just--
nothing to do, just
surf, surf.

328
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,428
No, I just surf one thing.
The things I want to know
I surf.

329
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,729
Then after that I leave.
