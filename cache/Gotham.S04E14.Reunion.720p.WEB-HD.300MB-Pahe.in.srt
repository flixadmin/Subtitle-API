1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,300
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,360
- The Doc, you know 'em?
- Oh, I know The Doc.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,110
Sometimes we search for things

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,910
- we don't wish to find.
- Doc! Doc!

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,630
- I enjoy being the queen of Gotham.
- Glad we understand each other.

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,060
There are other ways

7
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,330
for me to hurt you.

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,220
Something's eating at you,
Jim, and you're not gonna

9
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,000
feel clean till you get
it off your chest.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,430
That's done now.

11
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,340
I'm at Sofia Falcone's.

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,810
I just shot and killed the Pyg.

13
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,820
I see Arkham's treating you well.

14
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,840
- Good-bye, Oswald.
- I am held captive,

15
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,280
all my brilliance locked away.

16
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,450
You're still there.

17
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,170
And you're gonna help me
find a way out of here.

18
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,660
- I need a name.
- Ivy Pepper.

19
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,190
- I know Ivy.
- No she's changed, like, a lot.

20
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,540
Called Lazarus Water.

21
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,880
What are you going to do with it?

22
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,530
I'm going to make miracles happen.

23
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,180
Reel it in a little? Or
should I call your keeper?

24
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,590
Call Alfred. He won't answer.

25
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,340
- Why?
- 'Cause I fired him.

26
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,210
Where is the other guy who works here?

27
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,450
You mean Harvey?

28
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,470
He's out sick. You want
to leave a message?

29
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,490
I do.

30
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,490
All right. What should I say?

31
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,320
Nothing.

32
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,580
Because all of you, with your blood

33
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,570
and your flesh and what
you will become...

34
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,020
you are the message.

35
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,530
-- Synced and corrected by ChrisKe --

36
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,680
He was a good man.

37
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,170
It doesn't matter that Mario is gone.

38
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,190
You'll always be my sister.

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,440
For Falcones, it's all about family.

40
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,490
I appreciate that.

41
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,350
So, sister to sister,

42
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,130
we're not really here
to look at photographs.

43
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,940
There's only one neighborhood in Gotham

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,330
that hasn't bent the knee.

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,090
The Narrows has never
submitted to an outside boss.

46
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,570
There's never been someone
like me ruling Gotham.

47
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,680
Okay.

48
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,020
What do you want?

49
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,680
A tax.

50
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,160
30% on all income coming
from the Narrows,

51
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,860
legal and illegal.

52
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,920
Every family there lives hand
to mouth. They'll starve.

53
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,280
We all have to make sacrifices.

54
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,040
I'll need an answer by
the end of the day.

55
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,880
You want me to kiss the ring,
I'll do it to keep the peace,

56
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,170
but what you're asking
for is impossible.

57
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,380
You'll find a way.

58
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,990
Thought it was all about family.

59
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,820
Never said it was a happy family.

60
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,030
Thank you.

61
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,790
Thank you for meeting me.

62
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,250
My parents' foundation is having
their annual dinner tonight.

63
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,930
I thought we'd go.

64
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,230
Somehow, I don't think you
called me all the way down here

65
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,180
to talk about a fundraiser, did you?

66
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,380
Bruce, what exactly...

67
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,220
is it that you want from me?

68
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,250
Help.

69
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,020
Figuring this out. I can't do it alone.

70
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,110
I...

71
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,030
Alfred, I need your help.

72
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,670
No.

73
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,380
What?

74
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,880
Listen, you can't just waltz
back in here and expect me

75
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,140
to go and clean your
smalls and cook your tea,

76
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,070
- after what you've done.
- Alfred, I'm not asking for that.

77
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,080
- I've changed.
- Oh, you have, have you?

78
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,340
See, it's one thing saying
that you've changed

79
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,810
and another actually changing.

80
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,140
So... show me.

81
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,350
Show me how you've changed,
I might reconsider.

82
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,640
Show you how?

83
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,800
Well...

84
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,540
that's for you to figure out, isn't it?

85
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,200
I'm asking... as a friend.

86
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,550
I am not... your friend.

87
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,140
I was your butler.

88
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,410
And you fired me.

89
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,630
He'll pay for the tea, miss.

90
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,090
Sure hope Lee is gonna figure
something out with Sofia.

91
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,850
Lee being the love of your life and all.

92
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,960
We're friends.

93
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,830
You know, those cuckoo pills

94
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,190
aren't gonna make me go away.

95
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,530
Well, they have stopped
you from getting out

96
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,820
and trying to kill Lee
again, so works for me!

97
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,460
Mail arrived.

98
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,860
Oh, who's it from?

99
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,880
Oswald.

100
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,280
"I want to apologize."

101
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,770
"Can we be friends again?" What?

102
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,690
What is he... I'm never
gonna forgive him.

103
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,460
Oh, I think it's a nice letter.

104
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,190
- Oh, shut up!
- Hey, Ed.

105
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,340
What has two eyes but can't see?

106
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:49,020
What has two...?

107
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,810
Good Lord. This is new.

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,640
More aggressive.

109
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,840
Plants are literally bursting
through their flesh.

110
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,110
You! Get away from that now.

111
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,430
Now.

112
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,830
Same flower growing out of these bodies.

113
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,340
That's a weapon?

114
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,110
Gordon.

115
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,459
This must be what Ivy did
with the Lazarus Water.

116
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,850
Used it to increase the
potency of a toxic plant.

117
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,930
- The seeds made it airborne...
- Where's Bullock?

118
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,780
- What?
- He works here.

119
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,930
Harvey killed Ivy's father.

120
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,800
Clear.

121
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,620
- Too late.
- No, we're not.

122
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,090
Hey!

123
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,620
Hey!

124
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,450
Aah! Damn it, Jim!

125
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,290
Jim, what the hell?!

126
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,320
- Hey, someone's paying for that door!
- Ivy Pepper.

127
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,790
Who?

128
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,790
Mario Pepper's kid... she's
been working on some biotech.

129
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,800
She attacked your bar.

130
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,470
It's bad.

131
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,480
Donnie, the bartender?

132
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,650
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, God.

133
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,450
Look, I got to think that
you were the target.

134
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,740
Jim, I only shot Ivy Pepper's dad

135
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,060
because I was saving your stupid hide!

136
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,950
- You can't put this on me!
- Guys.

137
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,680
- I'm not putting it on you!
- Guys!

138
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,350
In the interest of public
safety, we have decided

139
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,320
to share the footage, so in a moment,

140
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,850
the video we are about to show you

141
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,570
is from a tape received this morning.

142
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,010
And again, let me warn you,
it is very disturbing.

143
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,160
Plants love us.

144
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,250
They give us food, shelter,

145
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,510
the very air we breathe.

146
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,510
And what do we do in return?

147
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,280
Kill them.

148
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,700
Because that's our nature.

149
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,580
We cause pain.

150
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,390
Everyone I've known has
only hurt or betrayed me.

151
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,310
Maybe I've always known in my
heart what I needed to do.

152
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,590
But I finally have the power to do so.

153
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,360
I'm giving your city back to the plants,

154
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,990
starting with the people who hurt me.

155
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,770
So if that's you...

156
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,800
your time is coming.

157
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,360
- Guess we know what she's up to.
- Yeah.

158
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,390
She's gonna kill everyone in Gotham.

159
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,270
Starting with me.

160
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,320
Preliminary reports
indicate that similar takes

161
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,520
have been delivered to
multiple news organizations...

162
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,360
Wait a minute. What's that there?

163
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,840
"Sully's Eatery."

164
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,870
That's in Ives Square. House
must be right across.

165
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,370
You should go to the precinct.

166
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,480
Hey, I'm not hiding like
some freaking coward.

167
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,710
All right? Four people are
dead because she wanted me.

168
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,940
Okay. Then we'll work on it together.
You can wear the badge.

169
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,920
Get this straight, Jim! I ain't
working for you now or ever.

170
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,790
I got more contacts in the
Narrows than any of you.

171
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,110
I'm gonna find her, alone.

172
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,170
Once I find my pants.

173
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,570
Doesn't make any sense.

174
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,740
There's no money here.

175
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,710
Okay, so it's about power.

176
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,840
I offered to bend the knee.

177
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,440
She's asking for something
she knew I couldn't give.

178
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,010
She wants...

179
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,170
She wants to punish me.

180
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,940
For what?

181
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't know, but you
can't fight an enemy

182
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,590
whose motivations you
don't understand, Lee.

183
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,800
You... are the greatest
spies in all of Gotham.

184
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,620
You have eyes and ears everywhere.

185
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,220
The survival of the
Narrows depends upon you!

186
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,840
Whoever learns why Sofia Falcone

187
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,580
wants to destroy Lee
Thompkins will receive...

188
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,860
a complete set of encyclopedias.

189
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,390
Minus the "T."

190
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,910
- Plus 20 bucks.
- Yeah! Yes!

191
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,610
Go get 'em.

192
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,190
She wasn't bluffing.

193
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,380
With this many plants,

194
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,570
she could kill hundreds, if
not thousands, of people.

195
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,200
Search the other room for any
signs of where she's heading.

196
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,470
What are you gonna do to her?

197
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,240
Where is she?

198
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,670
I don't know.

199
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,240
I just saw the news.

200
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,370
She killed four more people today.

201
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,280
You knew where she was staying.

202
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,440
If you had told me,

203
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,840
- we could've saved lives.
- Or not.

204
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,660
I mean, you couldn't even stop her

205
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,510
from hypnotizing your own cops.

206
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,530
So why'd you come here?

207
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,710
- To try to reason with her.
- Have you heard a word she said?

208
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,930
- She's a fanatic.
- She's my friend.

209
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,740
I mean, what do you expect me to do?

210
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,470
She contacts you again, call me.

211
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,340
I'll try and find her and
bring her in quietly.

212
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,040
Otherwise, stay out of her way.

213
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,420
- Harvey?
- Hey.

214
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,280
- I got a lead.
- Great.

215
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,040
I knocked some heads, heard a
hot redhead was poking around

216
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,730
in that dive bar next door.

217
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,260
That is the place in the
Narrows for low-end muscle,

218
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,200
so I figured if she was
planning something big,

219
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,060
she might've gone there to recruit.

220
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,150
That's the back entrance. That's
where my contact said that...

221
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,500
Hello, Detective Gordon.

222
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,910
On the ground, now.

223
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,900
Harvey, call it in.

224
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,810
She's beautiful, don't you think, Jim?

225
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,240
Drop your weapon.

226
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,810
You don't look good.

227
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,720
Think you might be exceeding
your recommended dosage.

228
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,700
Are you experiencing...

229
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,720
"trembling extremities"? Check.

230
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,600
"Cognitive impairment"? Definite check.

231
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,370
Though, to be fair, how would you know?

232
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,560
Shut up!

233
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,640
Take all the pills you want, Ed.
I'm only getting stronger.

234
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,600
Soon, I'm gonna be out,

235
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,700
- and the fun begins!
- No.

236
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,040
I won't let you, 'cause
I know what you'll do.

237
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,830
Oh, you mean kill Lee?

238
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,990
Yeah, I guess I will do that.

239
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,740
And you can't stop me.

240
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,330
- There are things that I can do.
- Like what?

241
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,950
You need to face it, pal.

242
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,010
The only way you'll get rid
of me is to kill yourself.

243
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,090
I guess you are smarter than me.

244
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,330
- You wouldn't actually...
- Oh, yeah.

245
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,150
Oh, yeah.

246
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,480
I said drop the gun, Jim.

247
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,650
Do you believe in fate,
Detective Gordon?

248
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,200
I went out today to test my plants

249
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,290
on the man who shot my father.

250
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,500
He wasn't there.

251
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,970
It was disappointing.

252
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,320
Then, he found me,

253
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:47,360
and I realized I could make him
deliver his partner as well.

254
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,250
Fate.

255
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,390
Stay strong, Harvey.
She's controlling you.

256
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,900
I kind of like it, Jim.

257
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,860
Sweet surrender.

258
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,520
You need help, Ivy. Let me find Selina.

259
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,430
- She wants to help you.
- Quiet.

260
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,040
I have to go.

261
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,390
Big plans tonight. Lots
of people to kill.

262
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,270
- Detective Bullock?
- Ma'am?

263
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,970
After you kill your partner,

264
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,200
be sure to shoot yourself
in the head, okay?

265
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,580
Copy that.

266
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,790
Harvey... Don't even try and
talk your way out of this!

267
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,920
I wouldn't.

268
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,360
But... quick question.

269
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,650
Is Ivy's hair more auburn or scarlet?

270
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,760
I, um... That's a good Que...

271
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,210
Think I didn't come prepared? Huh?

272
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,630
You always underestimate me.

273
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,220
That's not why I'm shooting you.

274
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,660
I just think we should,
uh... clear the air.

275
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,370
What do you want to talk about?
I'm all ears.

276
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,170
How you stole my job, for starters!

277
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,870
Was it really your job, though?

278
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,580
I mean, you only got it
'cause one captain died,

279
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,270
- and the other one went nuts.
- Like hell!

280
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,540
I paid my dues! I earned
that job, and you took it!

281
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,650
You mean like the time you
gut-shot Officer Patel?

282
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,480
That was... a mistake.

283
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,040
Hey, give yourself some credit.

284
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,380
Did shoot her from across the room.

285
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,980
Although you couldn't
face her later, remember?

286
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,410
You didn't have the courage to
meet her the next day, did you?

287
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,050
- You coward.
- Screw you!

288
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,190
We're not open.

289
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,370
- I wanted to see you.
- Why? Because you weren't

290
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,620
big enough of an ass the
last time I saw you?

291
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,680
Selina... I don't have
time for this, Bruce.

292
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,590
Something happened.

293
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,600
- I need to talk to someone.
- Okay, then go find Alfred.

294
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,890
Oh.

295
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,190
You did.

296
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,650
And he wanted nothing to do with you.

297
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,570
Smart guy, Alfred.

298
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,860
Will you at least hear me out?

299
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,200
No, Bruce, because Ivy's
out there killing people,

300
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,859
and I need to find her and stop her.

301
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,540
So whatever problem you have

302
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,860
going on right now, you
need to figure it out.

303
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,150
I mean, say sorry to Alfred.

304
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,710
'Cause I'm sure whatever
happened was your fault.

305
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,110
According to my spies,

306
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,780
Sofia and Jim were
carrying on an affair,

307
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,570
till Jim ended it.

308
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,520
So, technically,

309
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,160
your ex has been sleeping with

310
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,580
- your dead husband's mafiosa sister...
- Okay, Ed, I get it.

311
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,899
If Sofia was sleeping with
the captain of the GCPD,

312
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,960
it was a power play.

313
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,290
And it failed.

314
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,500
I'm her next step.

315
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,670
Why don't I just give
her what she wants:

316
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,080
Power over Jim Gordon.

317
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,290
You would do that?

318
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,570
I'm not trying to get back at
Jim, though he deserves it.

319
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,730
My job is to make sure

320
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,480
that the people of the Narrows are safe,

321
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,090
and I will do everything in
my power to ensure that.

322
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,290
What?

323
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,960
Lee...

324
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,220
I...

325
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,750
I, uh...

326
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,810
I have to leave.

327
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,770
Harvey. Harvey, come on.

328
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,580
- Hey, come on.
- Okay. Whoa. Whoa.

329
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,620
Where am I?

330
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,380
You were hypnotized.
I need you to focus.

331
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,980
Did Ivy give you any clue about
who she's targeting next?

332
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,660
I can't believe I let her get to me.

333
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,800
Hey, you want to help?

334
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,520
Here's how. Did she say anything?

335
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,800
Something about, uh,

336
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,960
"They get rich by murdering plants"?

337
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,490
So she's targeting a
group of rich people?

338
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,640
At her place,

339
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,590
she was trying on fancy
clothes, fancy shoes.

340
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,900
A party?

341
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,030
She said she had big plans,

342
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,340
- couldn't be late.
- Come on.

343
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,710
- Yeah, black tie. Fancy-schmancy.
- No, no, no. Come on.

344
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,050
You know, like a charity
for hobos or something.

345
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,370
Wayne Foundation's annual
dinner is tonight,

346
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,140
over at Gotham Square.

347
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,650
All right. Get the Strike Force.

348
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,480
I want full body armor, gas
masks, nonlethal rounds.

349
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,040
- T-To fight plants?
- When Ivy got me, she was hypnotizing

350
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,450
- a bunch of low-end muscle.
- Go.

351
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,050
Could really use you there, Harv.

352
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,500
Jim, she got in my head.

353
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,590
I really, I just don't
trust myself right now.

354
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,380
All right. You can help out here.

355
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,840
Man the phones.

356
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,740
Hey, Jim.

357
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,890
I spent too long putting
this all on you.

358
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,780
What happened between us.

359
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,990
Fact is, I only got myself to blame.

360
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,870
I'll call.

361
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,360
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

362
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,620
please welcome to the stage
our host, Bruce Wayne.

363
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,140
Good evening.

364
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,300
Welcome to the third annual dinner

365
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,860
for the Thomas and
Martha Wayne Foundation.

366
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,920
This year, we disbursed $4 million in...

367
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,530
Um...

368
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:48,470
Uh, we-we disbursed
$4 million, and, uh...

369
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,460
My parents spent their
lives helping people.

370
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,170
I was so proud of them,

371
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,240
and I always wanted
them to be proud of me.

372
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,840
And then I saw them get murdered.

373
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,270
I survived because someone
in my life kept me going.

374
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,070
He's been everything to me.

375
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,650
A teacher.

376
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,000
A protector.

377
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,660
He's been a father to me.

378
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,940
I hope... I hope he can see that.

379
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,360
And give me another chance.

380
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,860
Thank you.

381
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,560
Thank you.

382
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,590
That meant a great deal.

383
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,030
But I can't help you.

384
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,430
Not until you accept who you really are.

385
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,920
I know who I am. I've
seen what's inside me.

386
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,080
Darkness and anger.

387
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,260
But what's beneath that?

388
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,170
It's a heart that feels pain.

389
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,790
Your heart, it's what makes you
want to help other people.

390
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,120
Your heart is your strength.

391
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,030
Deny the darkness and you deny that.

392
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,030
But accepting that is something

393
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,140
that you must do on your own.
Do you understand me?

394
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,650
I was stupid for reaching out.

395
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,010
That was quite a speech.

396
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,030
Hello, all.

397
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,050
I'm Ivy Pepper.

398
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,820
No, no, no. Please.

399
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,210
Stay seated.

400
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,230
Can I just say...

401
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,160
this is crazy!

402
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,210
Well, this whole thing was your idea.

403
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,960
And you're the smart one,
as you always tell me.

404
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,620
Oh, very funny.

405
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,790
Okay, fine!

406
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,420
Fine! You win!

407
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,530
- What?
- You... win.

408
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,780
You beat me. Is that
what you want to hear?

409
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,090
That is very nice.

410
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,610
But I still have to do it.

411
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,130
Wait!

412
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,750
Wait. Wait.

413
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,610
What if there's a way

414
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,810
to do this where nobody gets hurt?

415
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,600
- I don't believe you.
- So you're just gonna

416
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,490
kill yourself without hearing me out?

417
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,480
I'm telling you, Ed, there is a way

418
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,310
to save Lee without killing yourself!

419
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,650
Or killing us.

420
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,960
I'm listening.

421
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,920
Aren't these crimson flowers lovely?

422
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,090
You're a handsome man.

423
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,110
But you want more from life.

424
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,990
I can feel it.

425
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,930
Bruce! Is Ivy Pepper in there?

426
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,680
Ivy? No. I mean, I didn't see her.

427
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,530
Get out of here. Let's go!

428
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,530
OFFICER; Breach that door!

429
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,030
We...

430
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,500
are going to turn this room into

431
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,500
the most gorgeous garden
the world has ever seen.

432
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,960
All you have to do...

433
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,770
is take a deep... breath.

434
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,700
Ah.

435
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,140
A volunteer.

436
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,570
GCPD! GCPD!

437
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,930
Drop your guns on the ground now!

438
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,030
Kill everyone.

439
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,430
You got this. I'm going after Ivy.

440
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,770
I'm getting you out of here.

441
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,690
- Come on, let's go.
- Listen, listen.

442
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,650
People need your help.

443
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,640
This is who you are.

444
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,350
Watch the doors. I'm
gonna go look for him.

445
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,160
Where'd you go, punk? You can
run, but you can't hide.

446
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,270
Hey! Hey!

447
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,390
- Drop it!
- No!

448
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,920
Hey. Hey!

449
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,600
You hear the news?

450
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,170
Crazy Ivy Pepper attacks the
Wayne Foundation dinner.

451
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,220
I'll be honest, the evening didn't
turn out quite the way I'd hoped.

452
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,260
You mean you didn't get to
kill everyone in there?

453
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,740
Something like that.

454
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,640
You got out.

455
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,830
Made it back here.

456
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,260
You always were the survivor.

457
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,570
Well, you taught me that, Selina.

458
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,240
What's in the bag, Ivy?

459
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,080
It's the last of the Lazarus Water

460
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,000
I stole from Wayne Enterprises.

461
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,380
So you can go

462
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:27,240
and make more plants to kill people?

463
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,570
Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.

464
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,810
Are you gonna stop me, Selina?

465
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,670
You gonna remind me of the old days,

466
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,120
tell me I'm not this person?

467
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,050
No, I think we're past words now.

468
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,010
Well, Selina Kyle

469
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,200
turns out to be the hero.

470
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,980
I'm no hero.

471
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,030
One scratch is all it takes, Selina.

472
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,680
And there's no antidote this time.

473
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,580
And there's no more
jumping across rooftops

474
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,100
for little dead Selina.

475
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,810
I'll keep that in mind.

476
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,650
You're gonna have to fight me, Selina.

477
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,750
You can't run forever.

478
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,790
I wasn't running.

479
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,890
I was getting this.

480
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,860
This is what you're gonna use
to make all your little plants?

481
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,110
So I guess it's safe to say
that I shouldn't drop it.

482
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,620
Stop, Selina.

483
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,600
- I will let you leave.
- Let me?

484
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:07,560
You're not gonna turn me into some

485
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,760
geranium type thing?

486
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,050
That's so generous.

487
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,240
No!

488
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,270
How can you side with them?

489
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,760
All the people who hurt us.

490
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,150
You think they're innocent.

491
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,410
They're guilty.

492
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:38,580
Every person in this city.

493
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,930
They spew out poison.

494
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,580
How are you not choking on it?

495
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,810
The only thing that I'm choking
on, Ivy, is your insanity.

496
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,910
You shouldn't have done that.

497
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,590
- Now you're gonna die.
- Ivy, look down.

498
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,260
- Well.
- Yeah.

499
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,530
So, what happens now?

500
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,620
- We kill each other?
- That's an option.

501
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,980
You always did think you
were better than me.

502
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:30,300
That's not true. I was your friend.

503
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,560
We were friends, Ivy.
You said so yourself.

504
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,560
That was a long time ago.

505
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,380
I'm a different person now.

506
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,520
This isn't what I want.

507
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,520
Don't get in my way again.

508
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,850
Lift your hands up. Got any weapons?

509
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,150
I'd almost think

510
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:30,410
this wasn't going to be a
friendly conversation.

511
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:32,360
Just being careful.

512
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,480
- They're clean.
- Okay.

513
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,350
Smart lady.

514
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,560
So you said you wanted 30% of
everything in the Narrows.

515
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:42,340
What if I told you

516
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,650
I had something more valuable to offer?

517
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,030
Such as?

518
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,300
Jim Gordon.

519
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,740
I know crimes he's committed
no one else does.

520
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,800
It would give you control over him.

521
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,710
Surely that's worth
more than 30% of this.

522
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,640
I have my own dirt on Jim Gordon.

523
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,020
But you can't use it.

524
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,940
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
sitting there threatening me.

525
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,490
Would you?

526
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,230
Sofia,

527
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,120
take my deal.

528
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,830
I have a better way to
bring Gordon around.

529
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,760
No! No!

530
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,720
Stay with me. Stay with me.

531
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:40,460
You're never gonna get
out of here alive.

532
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,120
- My people are gonna kill you!
- Your people?

533
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,480
Who do you think planted these guns?

534
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,900
You can come out.

535
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,710
How you doing, Doc?

536
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:58,140
I'm having Sampson run the Narrows.

537
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,410
You know, you should've killed
me when you had the chance.

538
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,990
Mm, the fact that you didn't

539
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,510
told me everything I needed to know.

540
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,810
No!

541
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,970
Since we're family, I'm
only going to do one hand.

542
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,690
Throw her on the streets.

543
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,520
Let the Narrows see their queen.

544
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,230
Reporter: The scene here
remains largely out of control

545
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,660
but Ivy Pepper remains at large.

546
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,260
Now, inside, we have a
team of investigators...

547
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,670
Yeah.

548
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,800
What?

549
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,090
Where is she?

550
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,700
Sir?

551
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,980
Sir? Excuse me.

552
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,220
Are you family?

553
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,840
I'm a cop.

554
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,770
She wouldn't tell us who do it.

555
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,410
She didn't have to.

556
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:52,580
Arkham doesn't get many volunteers.

557
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,180
You do know who I am, right?

558
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,330
Criminally-insane pretty much covers it.

559
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,080
Read...

560
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,520
and sign.

561
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,430
I'll be back.

562
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,540
Hate that you were right about this,

563
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,920
but it'll keep her safe.

564
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,580
Hey, Ed?

565
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,610
- What has two eyes but can't see?
- Oh, this again.

566
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,270
Two needles.

567
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,130
Half of "Mississippi." Who cares?

568
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,110
You should, Ed.

569
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,180
I knew you'd come!

570
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:41,830
- I knew you'd understand my letter!
- How did you know I'd be...?

571
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,950
What are you talking about?

572
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:49,930
- I'm not talking to you, Ed.
- I'm talking to him.

573
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,430
He read my letter!

574
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,020
Read the first word of each sentence.

575
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,190
"Please bring Ed to Arkham
so I can set you free."

576
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,180
What has two eyes but can't see

577
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,550
what's happening in front of him?

578
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,790
Ed Nygma!

579
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,620
No. I came here to save Lee.

580
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,290
He read my letter!

581
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
You...

582
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,590
You're wrong!

583
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,350
I am Ed!

584
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,510
Edward Nygma! That is it!

585
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,080
Lee believes in me. She
sees me for who I am.

586
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:30,260
- But I see him, Ed!
- No.

587
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:35,080
Lee Thompkins may have made Ed strong,

588
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:38,440
but I see the other you.

589
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,790
The one whose name I wouldn't speak.

590
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,410
But because he has earned it,

591
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,220
and because I need him,
I'm saying it now.

592
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,180
No, please! Please don't.

593
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,940
- I need you...
- Please.

594
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,050
Riddler.

595
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,400
Shall we get to work?

596
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,920
So...

597
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,900
how'd you make it off the roof, then?

598
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,700
A fire escape on the next building.

599
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,600
Why'd you run from Gordon?

600
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,920
I mean, you could've
told him it was you.

601
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,840
I don't know.

602
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:59,050
I just... couldn't.

603
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,390
I'm going to help people, Alfred.

604
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,130
And if that means accepting
every part of myself,

605
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,240
good and bad,

606
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,230
then I will.

607
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,460
I do.

608
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,940
That's what my parents
would have wanted.

609
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,620
Your parents would be very proud of you.

610
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,030
I'm proud of you.

611
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,520
Alfred?

612
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:43,150
If you... need a ride back
to Gotham, I can drive you.

613
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,210
Oh, I'm not going anywhere, sir.

614
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,880
I'm home.

615
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,880
Congratulations.

616
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:10,210
I heard you saved the day.

617
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,020
Good job.

618
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,360
There's a reason you're captain,

619
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:19,290
and I'm a 50-year-old screw-up
pouring shots for barflies.

620
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,560
There's a reason, all right.

621
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,190
It's not what you think.

622
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,510
I screwed up, Harv.

623
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,460
I screwed up bad.

624
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,070
And I'm gonna need your
help to make it right.

625
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,960
Sofia hired the Pyg.

626
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,170
And I knew.

627
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,650
I knew,

628
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,970
and I covered it up.

629
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,850
And now I'm gonna take her down.

630
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:07,920
