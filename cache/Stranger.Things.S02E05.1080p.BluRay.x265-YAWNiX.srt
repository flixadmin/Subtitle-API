1
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,994
<i>Hey, you reached Jim.</i>

2
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,806
<i>I'm probably doing something incredible
right now, and I can't...</i>

3
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,534
<i>It's like... It's like I feel
what the shadow monster's feeling.</i>

4
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,486
See what he's seeing.

5
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,367
Like in the Upside Down?

6
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,245
Some of him is there.

7
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,249
But some of him is here, too.

8
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:33,508
- Here, like, in this house?
- In this house and...

9
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,586
in me.

10
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,516
It's like... It's like he's reaching
into Hawkins more and more.

11
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,512
And the more he spreads,
the more connected to him I feel.

12
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,689
And the more you see these now-memories.

13
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,484
At first I just felt it
in the back of my head.

14
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,152
I didn't even really know it was there.

15
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,322
It's like when you have a dream

16
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,868
and you can't remember it
unless you think really hard.

17
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:02,912
It was like that.

18
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,198
But know it's like...

19
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:09,919
Now I remember. I remember all the time.

20
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,669
Maybe...

21
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,626
- Maybe that's good.
- Good?

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,256
Just think about it, Will.

23
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:21,340
You're like a spy now. A superspy.

24
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,844
Spying on the shadow monster.

25
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,852
If you know what he's seeing
and feeling...

26
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,475
maybe that's how we can stop him.

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,313
Maybe all of this
is happening for a reason.

28
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,988
- You really think so?
- Yeah. Yeah, I really do.

29
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,074
What if he figures out
we're spying on him?

30
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,835
- What if he spies back?
- He won't.

31
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,669
How do you know?

32
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,674
We won't let him.

33
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,495
Ugh!

34
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
Ugh!

35
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,545
- Hey.
- Hey. Did you get 'em?

36
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:43,634
Yeah.

37
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,030
We'd like a... uh, a room.

38
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,535
We got those.

39
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,247
You want a single or a double?

40
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,418
Double.

41
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,313
Nance...

42
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,682
- Uh, on or off?
- Hmm.

43
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,402
- What?
- Nothing. Just...

44
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,355
déjà vu.

45
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,034
Yeah.

46
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,995
Don't you think it's weird?

47
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,749
What?

48
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,579
How we only seem to hang out
when the world's about to end?

49
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,910
It's not going to end.

50
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,830
Feels like it.

51
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,799
Still have yours?

52
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,507
- Yeah.
- Mmm...

53
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,638
Yeah, mine's bigger.

54
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,474
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

55
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,247
What happened?

56
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,871
What do you mean?

57
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,838
To us?

58
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,925
After everything, you just...

59
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,846
disappeared.

60
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,348
Yeah, Will needed me.

61
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,725
And Steve...

62
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,395
I waited.

63
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,072
Yeah, like, only a month.

64
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,206
I want them off.

65
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,357
Will, what's wrong?

66
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,663
Mom?

67
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,791
Mom?

68
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,455
- Mom?
- Yeah?

69
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,588
- I saw him.
- You saw who, baby?

70
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,790
Hopper.

71
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,550
I think he's in trouble.

72
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,088
I think he's going to die.

73
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,092
Shit!

74
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,750
- That's enough, Erica.
- Uh-uh.

75
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,998
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?

76
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,465
When Mom's mad at you,
how do you make her not mad?

77
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,919
Hmm. That's a great question.
How do you, hon?

78
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,096
First, I apologize.

79
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,424
Then, I get your mother
whatever she wants.

80
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,929
Even when she's wrong?

81
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,724
She's never wrong, son.

82
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,765
That's right.

83
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,232
- Not hungry?
- Not really.

84
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:39,943
Where you goin'?

85
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,109
To hang out with Dustin.

86
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,578
Sorry.

87
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,762
Mews!

88
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,802
Mewsy!

89
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,850
Mews!

90
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,436
Mewsy!

91
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,777
Dusty, baby, you're sure
she's not in your room?

92
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,103
Uh-huh.

93
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,117
<i>If you'd like to make a call...</i>

94
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,737
Thank you so much,
Mr. McCorkle. Thank you so much.

95
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,738
You are a true lifesaver.

96
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,535
All right, this was great.

97
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,204
Thank you. All right. Have a good one.

98
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,282
Bye-bye, now. All right. You, too.

99
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,413
All right, great news.

100
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,790
They found her?

101
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,044
No. But they saw her wandering
around Loch Nora.

102
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,297
How did the poor baby
get all the way out there?

103
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,004
I don't know. Lost, I guess.
But they're gonna look for her.

104
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,340
And I'll stay here,
just in case they call again.

105
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,267
And you're gonna go help look? Yeah? Yeah?

106
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:53,061
Give me hug.
Give me a hug. Go get her.

107
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,388
- You're gonna find her.
- Okay.

108
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,064
- We can find her.
- We can find her.

109
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,766
I love you.

110
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,396
- I love you.
- I love you.

111
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,853
- I love you.
- All right, go.

112
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,489
All right.

113
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:39,100
All right, Dart. Breakfast time.

114

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

120
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:22,768
Yes.

Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

I'm sorry. You ate my cat.

All right. I think this is it.

Yes.

Five-fifteen.

129
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,798
All right, "Five-fifteen." Sure.

130
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,178
Thank you.

131

Hey.

132
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,932
You apologize to your mama, yeah? Huh?

133
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,553
Must be scared half to death.

134

<i>Not the loudspeaker.
Above you, to the right.</i>

167
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:09,768
Nancy Wheeler. Jonathan Byers.
You two are a long way from home.

168
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,869
Well...

169
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,906
I hope you didn't come all this way
to tell me about the bear

170
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,082
in the Harrington kid's backyard.

171
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,584
I've heard that one already.

172
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,262
Take a look. Go ahead, don't be shy.

173
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,182
I followed up on 200 tips,

174
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,564
most bogus, but that's how
these things always go, okay?

175
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,105
I know every last step
Barbara took that day,

176
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,065
every last person she talked to.

177
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,072
The answer to what happened
to your friend, it's up here somewhere.

178
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:09,031
I assure you that.
I just gotta connect the right dots.

179
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,536
Timeline's wrong.

180
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,585
I'm sorry?

181
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,458
Your timeline is wrong.

182
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:21,465
And the girl with the buzzed hair,
she's not Russian. She's from Hawkins Lab.

183
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,261
Her name was Eleven.

184
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,555
You might wanna sit down for this.

185
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,460
If you're not out in an hour...

186
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:39,148
- Walking home. Yeah, yeah, I know.
- Hey! Watch the attitude, shitbird.

187
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,247
Sorry about that, Road Warrior.

188
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:56,963
What happened?

189
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,586
Short circuit in the motherboard.
A real bummer.

190
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,673
But fret not. I got another machine
up and running in the back.

191
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,091
Hold these.

192
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,280
You better get me that date now, Sinclair.

193
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,028
I told you I would.

194
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,487
And keep things PG in here, all right?

195
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,203
What is this shit, stalker?

196
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,832
Sorry. I just needed a safe place.

197
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,460
A safe place to what? Be creepy?

198
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,792
Listen. I'm gonna tell you the truth
about everything that happened last year.

199
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,503
But if anyone finds out,
you could be arrested.

200
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:49,635
Possibly killed.

201
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,343
- Killed?
- I need to know.

202
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,390
Do you accept the risk?

203
00:21:55,481 --> 00:22:00,522
- Oh, my God! This... this is so stupid.
- Do you accept the risk?

204
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,154
Yeah.

205
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:04,781
Sure. Fine.

206
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,698
I accept the risk.

207
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,581
Let's hear it.

208
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,167
Last year...

209
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,420
Will didn't get lost in the woods.

210
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,751
He got lost somewhere else.

211
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,306
Hey, is this where you saw him?
Is this where you saw Hopper?

212
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,232
I think so. Yeah.

213
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,361
Okay.

214
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,377
Here!

215
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,469
Okay, so... so Hopper is here?

216
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,673
Yeah. Now we just need to find out
where here is, right?

217
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,677
Right.

218
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,384
Did he say anything?
I mean, before he left?

219
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,642
Uh, some... something about vines?

220
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,145
Hopper.

221
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,912
Surprise. I would've called,
but you said not to clog up the line.

222
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,957
You know, I... We're fine,
we don't need anything.

223
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:42,912
When I was sick as a kid,
and I was sick all the time as a kid,

224
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:46,169
nothing made me feel better
than focusing on these brain teasers.

225
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,674
Those are great. Ah...

226
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:49,961
I could teach him how to play.

227
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,299
You know, he's sleeping.

228
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,015
Okay.

229
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,224
I could wait with you?

230
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,144
Listen, it's just not a good time.

231
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,017
But, um, you know what?
I'll call you, okay?

232
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,650
Thank you.

233
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,729
- You sure?
- Yeah.

234
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,732
Well, have him call me. They don't call me
Bob the Brain for nothing.

235
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,450
Bob!

236
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:16,996
That's my name.

237
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:26,798
Huh.

238
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:29,545
Hmm.

239
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,461
- You drew all these yourself?
- Mmm-hmm.

240
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,767
- Why, exactly?
- I... I told you the rules.

241
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,390
- No questions, okay?
- Yeah.

242
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,473
We... we just need you
to help us figure out what...

243
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,524
Bob? Bob?

244
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:48,528
Over here.

245
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,775
Where... where this is.

246
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,951
That's the objective. Find the X.

247
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,620
Yeah? What's at the X? Pirate treasure?

248
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,494
Bob, no questions.

249
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,584
Okay.

250
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,627
Let me talk to you for a second.
Hang on, guys.

251
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,218
Joyce, you can talk to me.
You know that, right?

252
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:18,423
Yeah.
What's the problem, exactly?

253
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,633
What's the problem?

254
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,888
Joyce, Will doesn't look well.

255
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,563
You don't look well.

256
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,560
What's going on?

257
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,357
Nothing. Nothing.

258
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,444
Is this an episode?
Is this one of Will's episodes?

259
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,604
No. No! No.

260
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,566
I'm sorry. I just... I don't...

261
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,823
see how any of this is good for Will,
or for you.

262
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:42,246
And even if I wanted to play along,
I mean, how could I figure anything out

263
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,164
if I don't understand
the context of the game?

264
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,248
- Or...
- What?

265
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,250
- What is it?
- I know that shape.

266
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,377
It's Lovers' Lake.

267
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,633
It's Lovers' Lake. I get it.

268
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,965
Okay, I get. That's Lake Jordan.

269
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,848
And if that's Lake Jordan,
then you can probably find...

270
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,771
Yeah, that's, uh, Sattler's quarry.

271
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,440
And if you just follow it naturally...

272
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,355
it moves to...

273
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,687
the Eno River.

274
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:17,070
And there it is.
That's the Eno, do you see it?

275
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,448
Okay, so the lines aren't roads.

276
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,199
But they act like roads.

277
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,906
And they act like roads 'cause when you
follow 'em, you'll see...

278
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:26,742
they don't go over water.

279
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,748
And that's the giveaway.
That's the giveaway. Ha!

280
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,278
Don't you get it? It's not a puzzle,

281
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,081
it's a map.

282
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,001
It's a map of Hawkins.

283
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,307
Right, Will?

284
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,307
Does anybody copy?

285
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,770
Look, if anybody copies,
this is Jim Hopper, Hawkins' Chief...

286
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,018
Guys, this is Dustin again.

287
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:20,401
Does anyone copy? This is a code red.
I repeat, a code red!

288
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,904
I really need someone to pick up here.

289
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,280
Hopper's MIA, and I've got a code red.

290
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,239
Code red!

291
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,291
All right, it's Dustin again.

292
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,788
Seriously, I have a code red.

293
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,166
Could you please shut up?

294
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,997
Erica? Erica, is Lucas there?

295
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:41,129
<i>- Where is he?</i>
- Don't know. Don't care.

296
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,301
Is he with Mike?

297
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,971
Like I said,
I don't know and I don't care.

298
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:49,847
Please tell him it's super important.
Please tell him that I have a code...

299
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,018
Code red?

300
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,312
- Yep, code red. Exactly.
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>

301
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,560
I got a code for you instead.

302
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:58,894
It's called code shut-your-mouth.

303
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,740
Erica?

304
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,153
I just need a little help
understanding, sweetie, okay?

305
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:13,541
Can you tell me where you came from?

306
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:17,212
Where you've been all this time?

307
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,085
A policeman and a woman
came looking for you last year.

308
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,546
Did they find you?

309
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,176
She won't get better...

310
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,471
will she?

311
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,146
They don't think so, no.

312
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:39,271
But she's not in any pain.

313
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,817
She's just stuck, they think.

314
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,031
Like in a dream.

315
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,491
A long dream.

316
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,993
A good dream?

317
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,621
I hope so.

318
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,627
Is it the same dream?

319
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,629
We don't know.

320
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,129
Sometimes she says different words.

321
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,709
But usually those.

322
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,643
She always believed
that you were out there.

323
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:17,689
She always believed
that you'd come home one day.

324
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,652
Home?

325
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,069
Yeah, home.

326
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,239
Pretty.

327
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:12,198
I can get you a real bed,
and you can stay here with me

328
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,287
if you want.

329
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,075
How's that sound?

330
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:26,333
I wanna help you, but to really do that,
I need you to talk to me, okay?

331
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,585
Doesn't have to be now.
Doesn't have to be today.

332
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:31,925
But when you're ready.

333
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,849
Okay?

334
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:38,979
Okay.

335
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,228
Oh, yeah, that.

336
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,110
That happens sometimes.

337
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,362
Old house, bad wiring...

338
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:56,825
Or if you ask
my crazy aunt Shirley, it's...

339
00:31:58,834 --> 00:31:59,834
haunted.

340
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,766
Sweetie, really, it's just the wiring.

341
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:18,853
No.

342
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,159
It's Mama.

343
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,952
Sunflower. Rainbow.

344
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,542
Three to the right. Four to the left.

345
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,540
I don't understand.

346
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,667
Four-fifty.

347
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,833
She knows I'm here.

348
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,398
She wants to talk.

349
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,359
Rainbow.

350
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,320
All right.

351
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,076
All right. I'm 3.6 inches,
what do you got?

352
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,032
I'm not sure. Mrs. Byers?

353
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,242
Hold on.

354
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:34,256
- Twenty-one feet, four inches.
- What about Tippecanoe to Danford Creek?

355
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,089
Danford?
Where's Danford?

356
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,182
Dining room.

357
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,219
Sixteen feet, ten inches.

358
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,599
What about Danford to Jordan?

359
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,432
Oh, come on.
This has gotta be enough.

360
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,062
It's not. It's... it's really not.

361
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,394
Okay. Can't you figure it out?

362
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:54,105
Well, it's hard.
The ratio isn't exactly one-to-one.

363
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:57,192
I mean, if you're twisting my arm,
and you are twisting my arm,

364
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,153
I would say that the X is...

365
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:05,617
maybe a half mile southeast of Danford?

366
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,123
Thank you. Thank you.

367
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,003
What? Are we... we really going?

368
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,508
I don't know, Cath.

369
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,093
Maybe if it was Margaret Thatcher,
that'd be another story.

370
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:27,681
Just a second, Cath.

371
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,066
Ted, can you get that please?

372
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,029
Sorry.

373
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:36,532
I got it.

374
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:43,121
Your line has been busy
for over two hours, Mr. Wheeler.

375
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,323
- Do you realize this?
- Oh, I do realize.

376
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,124
- Is Mike home?
- No.

377
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,418
No? Well, where the hell is he?

378
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,461
Karen, where's our son?

379
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:52,709
Will's!

380
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,041
- Will's.
- No one's picking up there.

381
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,797
Nancy. What about Nancy?

382
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,798
Karen, where's Nancy?

383
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,754
- Ally's!
- Ally's.

384
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,308
Our children don't live here anymore.
You didn't know that?

385
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,761
- Seriously?
- Am I done here?

386
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,723
Son of a bitch. You're really no help
at all, you know that?

387
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,557
Hey! Language.

388
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,458
Listen...

389
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,001
I've been thinking...

390
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:30,997
I love you. I'm sorry.

391
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,999
I'm sorry? What the hell am I sorry for?

392
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,089
Steve.

393
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:36,291
Are those for Mr. or Mrs. Wheeler?

394
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:37,875
- No.
- Good.

395
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,177
- Hey. What the hell? Hey!
- Nancy isn't home.

396
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,799
- Where is she?
- Doesn't matter.

397
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,847
We have bigger problems
than your love life.

398
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,014
Do you still have that bat?

399
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,343
- Bat? What bat?
- The one with the nails?

400
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,474
- Why?
- I'll explain it on the way.

401
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,393
- Now?
- Now!

402
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:45,953
Son of a bitch!

403
00:36:56,673 --> 00:37:00,087
Wait. Wait. No, no! No! No!

404
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,981
<i>And that was the last
we ever saw of her.</i>

405
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,033
<i>After that, she was just gone.</i>

406
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,908
I can't believe it's been that long.
Feels like yesterday.

407
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,823
Yeah. I mean, I bet.

408
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,284
- Wow.
- It's crazy.

409
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,129
I know.

410
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,704
It's crazy, but...

411
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:41,923
I really liked it.

412
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,630
- Liked it?
- Yeah.

413
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:47,555
- Well, I mean, I had a few issues.
- Issues?

414
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,347
I felt it was a little derivative
in parts.

415
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,675
What are you talking about?

416
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,681
I just wish it had
a little more originality.

417
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,307
- That's all.
- You don't believe me?

418
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:58,562
Lucas, come on, seriously?
How gullible do you think I am?

419
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,812
Why would I make this up?

420
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:05,570
I don't know. To impress me or something?
Or you're just, like, insane.

421
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,742
I tell you all of this.
I mean, top-secret stuff.

422
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,366
Risking my life.
And this is how you react?

423
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,038
Risking your life?

424
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,912
- Oh, so this is funny to you?
- Yeah. I mean...

425
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,920
kind of funny.

426
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,296
Stupid, but funny.

427
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,378
Where are you going?

428
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,426
Story time's over, isn't it?

429
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,388
What's wrong with you?
I gave you what you wanted.

430
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,891
I wanted to be a part of the group,
not a part of some joke.

431
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,187
It's not a joke.

432
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,980
You did a good job, okay?

433
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,907
You can go tell the others
I believed your lies

434
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,851
if it gets you experience points
or whatever.

435
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,148
We have a lot of rules in our party,

436
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,201
but the most important is,
"Friends don't lie."

437
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,278
Never ever. No matter what.

438
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,372
Is that right?

439
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,786
Then how do you explain this?

440
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,703
I had to do that. To protect you.

441
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:03,039
To protect me from who, exactly?

442
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,465
The big bad government baddies
from Hawkins Lab?

443
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:06,552
Lower your voice.

444
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,674
Maybe it was to protect me from
the Demogorgon from another dimension?

445
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,404
- Max, I'm serious, shut up!
- Oh, no, no!

446
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,511
You know what it was?
It was Eleven. The girl...

447
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,219
Stop talking.

448
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,562
You're going to get us killed.

449
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,982
Do you understand?

450
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,024
You're serious?

451
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,023
I really wish I wasn't.

452
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,202
Prove it.

453
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,616
I can't.

454
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,538
So what? I'm supposed to just trust you?

455
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Yes.

456
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,878
Shit. I gotta go. Um...

457
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:50,336
Don't follow me out. Okay?

458
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:52,964
Do you believe me?

459
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,181
The hell I tell you?

460
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:03,724
I'm not late.

461
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,354
You know what I'm talking about.

462
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:09,026
Oh, Lucas?

463
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,983
So he has a name now, huh?

464
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,193
It's a small town, okay?
We weren't hanging out.

465
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,488
Hmm. Well, you know
what happens when you lie.

466
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:19,708
I'm not lying.

467
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,638
<i>What if they try to replicate that?</i>

468
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,363
<i>The more attention we bring to ourselves,</i>

469
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,720
<i>the more people like the Hollands
who know the truth,</i>

470
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,722
<i>the more likely that scenario becomes.</i>

471
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,475
<i>You see why I have to stop
the truth from spreading, too.</i>

472
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,559
<i>Just the same as those weeds there.
By whatever means necessary.</i>

473
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,026
So, is it enough?

474
00:40:55,203 --> 00:41:00,164
The tape recording, is it enough?
Is it incriminating?

475
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,595
- What are you doing?
- Thinking.

476
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:20,722
With vodka?

477
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:24,271
It's a central nervous system depressant.
So yes, with vodka.

478
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,481
Music? Really?

479
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,531
Yes. It helps me...

480
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,569
What? Think?

481
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,132
How long is this gonna take?

482
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,054
Longer if you keep talking.

483
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:01,805
Is the tape incriminating or not?
It's a simple question.

484
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,176
There's nothing simple about it.

485
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,917
Nothing simple about anything
you've told me.

486
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,398
You don't believe us, do you?

487
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,441
I believe you, but that's not the problem.

488
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,896
You don't need me to believe you.
You need them to believe you.

489
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,276
- Them?
- Them.

490
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,483
With a capital "T."

491
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:23,699
Your priest, your postman, your teacher,
the world at large.

492
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,077
They won't believe any of this.

493
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,160
That's why we made the tape.

494
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:30,337
Oh. That's easy to bury. Easy.

495
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:33,757
He admits it. You heard it.
He admits culpability.

496
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:35,584
You're being naive, Nancy!

497
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,220
Those people...

498
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,515
They're not wired like me and you, okay?

499
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:45,811
They don't spend their lives trying to get
a look at what's behind the curtain.

500
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:48,101
They like the curtain.

501
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,275
It provides them stability,
comfort, definition.

502
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,360
This...

503
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,398
this would open the curtain,

504
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:57,027
and open the curtain
behind that curtain, okay?

505
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:02,032
So the minute someone
with an ounce of authority calls bullshit,

506
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:07,617
everyone will nod their heads and say,
"See? Ha! I knew it! It was bullshit."

507
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,202
That is, if you even get
their attention at all.

508
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,056
You're saying we did all of this
for nothing?

509
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,373
I'm saying, I'm thinking.

510
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:18,970
Ooh!

511
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,763
This is ridiculous.

512
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,184
- That's it. That's it!
- What's it?

513
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,361
It's just too strong. Too strong.

514
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:41,493
Better.

515
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,752
Perfect.

516
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,167
We water it down.

517
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:57,125
- Precisely.
- Wait. What?

518
00:43:57,218 --> 00:44:00,177
Your story. We moderate it.

519
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:03,884
Just like this drink here.

520
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:06,926
We make it more tolerable.

521
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:14,517
Perhaps Barbara was exposed
to some dangerous toxins.

522
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,149
A leak from the lab.
Like Three Mile Island or something.

523
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,073
Something scary but familiar.

524
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,694
Close enough that it hits the man
right where it hurts.

525
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,496
And those assholes that killed Barb...

526
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:29,869
They'll go down.

527
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,479
All right, what are we looking at?

528
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,909
This was some of the soil
we took yesterday.

529
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,300
Okay. So what is your concern?

530
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,303
Well, we didn't find
any signs of contamination.

531
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:50,010
Uh, nothing hazardous
other than some pesticides.

532
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,436
Well, it's a farm.

533
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,105
Right, right. Exactly. But...

534
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,513
Like this?

535
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,266
Yes.

536
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:34,938
It's okay if I sit here, right?

537
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,057
Yes.

538
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,518
And I won't mess it up
or anything?

539
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:40,853
- No.
- Okay.

540
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:45,316
If you talk to Terry, will you tell her
that I love her very much?

541
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,492
And that I'm sorry that I didn't believe...

542
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,945
- Stop talking.
- Okay, sorry.

543
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,868
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

544
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:58,746
Three to the right. Four to the left.

545
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:00,674
Four-fifty.

546
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,007
Breathe.

547
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:07,630
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

548
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,467
Three to the right. Four to the left.
Four-fifty.

549
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,344
- Breathe.
- Mama?

550
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:18,432
- Sunflower. Rainbow.
- Mama, it's me...

551
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:20,358
Three to the right. Four to the left.

552
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,901
- Four-fifty.
- Jane.

553
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,271
Breathe. Sunflower.

554
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,481
I'm here now.

555
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,782
Four-fifty.

556
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:32,617
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

557
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:33,868
I'm home.

558
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:35,542
No.

559
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,338
Mama!

560
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:54,510
Mama! Mama!

561
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,014
- Oh, my baby!
- What do I do?

562
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:58,333
- Mama, what do I do? Help me!
<i>- Breathe. Breathe.</i>

563
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:01,395
Just breathe. Breathe.
Just breathe, all right?

564
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,646
They're on their way.

565
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,228
- They're on their way, okay?
- Okay.

566
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:08,114
Stay with us, darling. Stay with us.

567
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:43,777
Hey, there.

568
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:47,737
Jane?

569
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,190
- Where's Jane?
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

570
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,445
No, I saw her.

571
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,777
- No, no, she wasn't breathing.
- She was crying.

572
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,784
- No.
- I heard it. He was there.

573
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,199
- Who was there?
- He took her.

574
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,330
Don't take it out! Terry!

575
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,794
- Terry!
- No! No!

576
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,838
Please don't!

577
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:08,713
Three to the right.
Four to the left.

578
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,912
Ma'am, can I see your badge?

579
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,492
Stay back. Stay back!

580
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,962
Jane? Jane?

581
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,396
Jane... No!

582
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:06,975
No! No! She's my child! No!

583
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,981
She's my child!

584
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,031
No! No.

585
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,618
No.

586
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,908
No. No. No.

587
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,288
Ah!

588
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:26,704
Four-fifty.

589
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,344
Breathe. They're on their way.

590
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,221
Stay with us, darling.

591
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,147

There's nothing. There's nothing here.

- Are... Are we close?
- We're in the vicinity.

605
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:26,583
What's that mean, the vicinity?

606
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:28,894
It means we're close.
I don't know. It's not precise.

607
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,020
But we did all that work.

608
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,694
I told you, the scale ratio is not
exactly one-to-one. We needed to take...

- What?

610
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,069
- I saw him.
- Where?

611
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,400
Not here. In my now-memories.

612
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,777
- In your what?
- Turn right!

613
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:52,418
Are you okay?

614
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:55,421
Superspy.

615

What's Jim doing here? Joyce?

616
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:02,383
- Boys, I need you to stay here.
- No. Mom, Mom, Mom, it's not safe.

617
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,344
That's why I need you to stay here!
Stay here!

Hey, be careful.

620
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:13,018
Just going down the hole.

621
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:15,238
Vines.

622
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:18,690
Give me that.

623
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,992
- The shovel?
- Yes, give me the shovel.

624
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,377
I need you to help me
get down there.

- Bob, are you okay?

630
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,653
Tunnels. Is this Will's map?

Hopper! Hopper!

634
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,877
We're in Will's map.

Hopper!

636

We're actually inside of Will's map.

Hopper!

638
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:18,963
How did he know all this?

639
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:27,018
Bob!

640
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,014
Over here!

641
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,559
It's his.

642
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:34,433
He's gotta be this way.

643
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:38,020
Come on.

644
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,657
Hopper!

645
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:49,372
Do you see anything?
I mean, in your now-memories?

646
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:09,934
Hopper!

647
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,894

What?

649
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:19,737
This is...

650
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:25,071
Oh! It's his arm.

651
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,575
It's choking him.

652
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,785
Knife.

653
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,620
- Knife?
- It's over there.

654
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,047
Okay.

655
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,796
Hands!

656
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:44,673
Hands!

657
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:48,765
Cut it...

658
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,563
Bastard!

659
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:02,233
Oh, my God.
Hopper, are you okay?

660
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:05,360
- Joyce.
- Are you okay? Are you okay?

661
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,735
- Hey, Bob.
- Hey, Jim.

662
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:11,071
Oh, God!

663
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,326
Go! Go! Go! Clear the area!

664
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:16,250
- Go!
- Wait.

665
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,543
Move, now!

666
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,969
Will? Will, you okay?

667
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:30,056
Will, what's wrong?

668
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:38,080
