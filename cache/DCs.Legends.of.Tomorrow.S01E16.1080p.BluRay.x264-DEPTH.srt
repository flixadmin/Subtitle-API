1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,970
<i>This season,
on</i> Legends of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:06,169
<i>I've assembled you all
because I need your help.</i>

3
00:00:06,383 --> 00:00:07,743
<i>The future of the world
is in peril</i>

4
00:00:07,884 --> 00:00:09,386
<i>because of Vandal Savage.</i>

5
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:12,180
<i>You've turned your back
on the very institution</i>

6
00:00:12,347 --> 00:00:13,723
you were meant to serve.

7
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:15,809
<i>The Time Masters.</i>

8
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:17,495
<i>They refuse to take action
against Savage</i>

9
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,399
because he didn't pose
a threat to the timeline.

10
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:22,774
The Oculus not only gives us
a window into time,

11
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:24,061
but the ability to shape it.

12
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:26,295
<i>If the Oculus is what
they're using to control us,</i>

13
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:27,570
then, we need to destroy it.

14
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:29,447
Shut it down!

15
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:32,367
There are no strings on me.

16
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:35,245
He traded his life for ours.

17
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:36,705
<i>He was a hero.</i>

18
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:39,457
<i>Unfortunately, Vandal Savage
has already succeeded</i>

19
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:41,501
<i>in murdering Miranda and Jonas.</i>

20
00:00:41,668 --> 00:00:43,461
<i>Savage still has Carter
and Kendra.</i>

21
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:44,713
This is a Timeship.

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,464
A little gift from our friends.

23
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:48,633
I no longer need
to rule the world.

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,886
I now have the ability
to change it.

25
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:05,926
What are we doing back here?

26
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:09,154
Savage has a Timeship
courtesy of the Time Masters

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,488
and the timeline is unclear

28
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:13,074
due to our destruction
of the Oculus, meaning--

29
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:14,826
Savage is lost to history.

30
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:17,162
Which is why
I've brought you all home.

31
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:18,663
Mission's not over, man.

32
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:21,750
Jax is right. We've lost Savage before.
We'll find him again.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,002
And then what? We have
no way of killing Savage,

34
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:26,355
<i>particularly now that Kendra and
Carter are in his possession.</i>

35
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:29,340
Assuming that they're still
alive, which is highly unlikely.

36
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:31,384
So that's it?
We're just giving up?

37
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:34,012
I'm on my way to the Refuge
to retrieve your younger selves

38
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:35,459
and return them to the timeline.

39
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:37,515
It will be as if you never left.

40
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:40,018
You think that we can just
return to our old lives,

41
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:43,104
and then pretend like
none of this ever happened?

42
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,690
That might be a tad difficult.

43
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:49,360
I had to bring you back to
May 2016, not January 2016.

44
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,697
Great. So what you're saying is
for the last five months

45
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:55,700
my mom probably thinks that
I'm dead. Thanks a lot, man.

46
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:59,704
Why?
Why the change of plans, Rip?

47
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:04,876
If you're getting back on that ship,
we get back on that ship.

48
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:08,713
In truth, I never left it.

49
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,886
I'm sorry
for all that I've asked of you

50
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,096
and that it all came to nothing.

51
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:20,558
I wish you all well.

52
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:29,234
I never liked that guy.

53
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,494
Hello? Hello?

54
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:43,581
Dad!

55
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:45,959
Hey.

56
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,920
- Hi, Daddy.
- Baby.

57
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:50,171
When did you get back?

58
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,506
I just got back.

59
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:53,800
I tried calling,
but nobody was answering.

60
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:55,552
I was at Laurel's
but she wasn't there.

61
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:57,262
Where is everyone?

62
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:02,267
It's Damien Darhk.
He's causing problems.

63
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,477
Good to know nothing's changed
in five months.

64
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:08,106
Dad?

65
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,317
What's wrong?
Is everything okay?

66
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:16,322
No, baby.

67
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,449
You're starting to scare me.

68
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:26,457
Damien Darhk was in prison,
and he escaped.

69
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:32,171
And everyone tried to stop him,

70
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:35,008
but your sister...

71
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,260
Honey, she, um...

72
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:39,762
No, Dad, no.

73
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,806
I'm sorry, baby.

74
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,975
- No. Dad. No.
- Come on, I got you.

75
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,520
I got you.

76
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:59,490
You idiot, we were in the clear!

77
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:00,857
He was going after us.

78
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:04,829
On foot!
You shot him and wasted ammo.

79
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:05,997
Cops are coming.

80
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:07,308
You wanna yell at me some more

81
00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:08,625
or should we both
get outta here?

82
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:11,002
<i>Neither.</i>

83
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:17,383
Hey, Mick.

84
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:20,386
Oh! It's me.
It's Ray.

85
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,389
I thought we should talk.

86
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:26,309
Drive.

87
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,024
You didn't waste any time
getting back to your old habits.

88
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:35,818
I like stealing stuff.
It makes me feel good.

89
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:38,071
Do you ever think that

90
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:39,917
maybe you weren't meant
to do this anymore?

91
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:42,992
What do you want, Haircut?

92
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,371
To apologize.

93
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:48,498
Sort of.

94
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:50,667
For Snart.

95
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,503
I was the one who
was supposed to die

96
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,712
and I can't help feeling--

97
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,382
It wasn't your fault.
It was his.

98
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:01,344
Son of a bitch never did
anything without a plan.

99
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,848
Maybe you're right.
Maybe he wanted this.

100
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,850
What are you doing
with your hand?

101
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:11,521
Maybe he wanted us to.
you know, be partners.

102
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,191
I think I'm gonna be sick.

103
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:16,567
I think Snart knew.

104
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,403
He knew that I'd keep
an eye out for you

105
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:19,904
and you'd keep
an eye out for me.

106
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:22,532
While doing what?

107
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,076
What we haven't finished doing.

108
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:33,042
"What was
H.G. Wells' childhood nickname?"

109
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,504
Bertie.

110
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:39,716
Incredible. You've gotten
every answer correct tonight.

111
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,051
Since when did you become
such a history buff?

112
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,762
I guess I've developed
a passion for it recently.

113
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,098
During your sabbatical?

114
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:50,101
<i>You hardly ever talk about it.</i>

115
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52,020
Martin?

116
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,357
I know, I'm-- I'm sorry.

117
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:58,943
My sabbatical was, um...

118
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:05,616
I left some
very important work unfinished.

119
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,121
The ship's not gonna
be here, Grey.

120
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:11,789
We saw it take off, remember?

121
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:16,461
Yes. And doing so
would've left...

122
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:18,546
Quantum signature.

123
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,853
That's what
I've been trying to tell Mick.

124
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:22,925
Radio beacon.

125
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,135
Quantum entangler.

126
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:25,303
Boring.

127
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:27,722
When do we
get in contact with Hunter?

128
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:33,401
Ms. Lance, are you all right?

129
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:35,063
How do we get
the <i>Waverider</i> back here?

130
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,444
Hi, Daddy. We miss you.

131
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:43,988
<i>- And love you.
- And love you.</i>

132
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:46,991
<i>Captain, I'm sorry to interrupt.</i>

133
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,078
Tell me you've located Savage.

134
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,830
<i>No. But we have received
a transmission</i>

135
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:54,916
<i>from 2016 Star City.</i>

136
00:06:57,794 --> 00:06:59,354
I don't understand.
It should've worked.

137
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:01,851
Did you account
for sub-space interference?

138
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:03,591
It's the first thing
I thought of.

139
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,301
Did you adjust for
temporal polarity?

140
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:06,677
Raymond, you insult me.

141
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,763
Can you reach the <i>Waverider</i>
or not?

142
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,690
- We're working on it.
- We're working on it.

143
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,143
Actually, guys,
I think it just worked.

144
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:25,029
Ha!

145
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:32,995
I thought I made my intentions
perfectly clear.

146
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,164
And we wish to be equally clear
about ours.

147
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:37,875
Do you mind?

148
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:39,842
Just checking to see
if you're real this time.

149
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:41,462
<i>You're not ditching us again.</i>

150
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:44,632
When the mission's over, then
we can all go our separate ways.

151
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,634
And this mission is not over.

152
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:47,802
Yeah, just curious

153
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:49,196
how much headway you've had
tracking Savage

154
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,263
without all of us.

155
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,472
None.

156
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,325
But neither have I got
myself into bar fights

157
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:54,934
in 1975 and the Old West,

158
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:57,436
put dwarf-star technology into
the hands of terrorists,

159
00:07:57,603 --> 00:08:00,022
or got myself turned into
a scary bird monster.

160
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:03,568
We get your point. Now get ours.

161
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:07,572
That ship's not taking off
without us. You got that?

162
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:26,507
Halt!

163
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:27,818
Please, don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

164
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,522
What the hell are you doing
out here, lady?

165
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:30,803
I was being held captive.

166
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,056
- By Nazis?
- No. Worse.

167
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,506
- Your helmet...
- What about it?

168
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:40,396
I've seen it before.

169
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:42,249
Paper. Do you have paper?
Something to write with?

170
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:43,953
- Lady, I think you're in shock--
- Please!

171
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:45,568
Yeah.

172
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,284
So if it wasn't Nazis,
who were you running from?

173
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,453
I need your helmet. Now!

174
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:19,518
I'm sorry, my love.
But this game is not over yet.

175
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:36,327
Despite my wishes
to pursue Savage alone,

176
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:37,804
it seems
that you're all intent on

177
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,622
seeing this thing through
till the bitter--

178
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:41,499
Oh! Speaking of "bitter."

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,126
You knew.

180
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,463
You dropped us off five
months later because you knew.

181
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,631
Knew what?

182
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,592
You knew
that Laurel was gonna die.

183
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,804
And now you're gonna
take me back

184
00:09:54,971 --> 00:09:57,181
and I'm gonna save my sister.

185
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:00,977
- I'm afraid that I--
- You should be afraid.

186
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:07,358
I can't allow you--

187
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:12,029
I don't care about the timeline!
You're taking me back now.

188
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,633
Look, Sara, I'm sure there's
a valid reason why Rip didn't--

189
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:16,158
Stay out of this.

190
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:20,329
What the hell, Rip?

191
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:22,972
Mr. Rory,
take Ms. Lance to sleep it off.

192
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,794
Not to dismiss
what just happened,

193
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:28,379
but we do have to find Savage.

194
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:29,786
Assuming that Kendra and Carter

195
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,149
are still on his Timeship,
he could--

196
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,508
Be anywhere in time and space.

197
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:34,385
Well, that narrows it down
a lot.

198
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:38,556
Sorry.

199
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:44,895
- Was this always over here?
- No, it lives over...

200
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:49,066
- Did you put it there?
- No, man.

201
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:50,818
Did you?

202
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,070
Dude, it's just a helmet.

203
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,490
- Chronometric repositioning.
- What?

204
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,951
Temporal changes can,
on occasion,

205
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:00,619
reverberate through
the timeline,

206
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:04,582
physically moving an object
from one place to another.

207
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:15,593
- Gideon.
<i>- Yes, Captain.</i>

208
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,430
Plot a course
for Saint-Lô, France, 1944.

209
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:22,933
- Why then?
- Because that's where Kendra is.

210
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,436
<i>How's that possible?</i>

211
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:27,104
She sent us a message
through time.

212
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:28,606
Go ahead. Say it.

213
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,649
Astonishing.

214
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:41,952
I brought you some company.

215
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,372
Oh! He might be
a little disoriented,

216
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,457
after the way
he came out of stasis.

217
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,626
I know you.

218
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:50,378
<i>Oh, you remember her?</i>

219
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,797
Well, at least his mind
isn't fully gone.

220
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:54,924
Hey, stay away from him!

221
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,467
I'm going to kill you.

222
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:01,806
You've had 4,000 years to do so
with no success.

223
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:05,309
What are you doing?

224
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:07,645
Your blood
is the key to unlocking

225
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:09,105
the Thanagarian technology.

226
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:10,981
"Thanagarian"?

227
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:15,653
The alien species which gave
the three of us our powers.

228
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:21,909
<i>They sent three meteorites containing
technology beyond human understanding.</i>

229
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:23,911
<i>When they are activated
by your blood,</i>

230
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,247
I will be able to erase
time itself,

231
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:28,707
and travel us back to 1700 BC.

232
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,000
No! No!

233
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,420
I will begin
my immortal life anew.

234
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,296
Only this time,
I won't be content

235
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,841
to whisper
in the ears of powerful men.

236
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,677
This time,
I will be the one with the power.

237
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,387
I will be a God.

238
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,482
Please try very hard
not to kill me.

239
00:12:56,861 --> 00:13:00,823
Rip, please take me back.

240
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,200
<i>I need your help.</i>

241
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,536
I need to save my sister.

242
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,205
And you know that
I would do this for you, Sara,

243
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:09,373
but I just can't.

244
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:12,501
I have never asked you
for anything.

245
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:15,921
And you, of all people,
should understand.

246
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:17,965
You have tried everything. We...

247
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:20,217
We have tried everything
to save your family.

248
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:23,971
And I would not wish the pain
of that failure upon anyone.

249
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,348
I would rather live
with that pain than this.

250
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:27,635
That's just the thing, Sara.

251
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:30,978
Look, if you were able
to try to save Laurel,

252
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:32,465
then you wouldn't be
alive at all.

253
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,148
Fine. I don't care.

254
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:39,695
When we left, when I recruited you...
We altered the timeline.

255
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:42,764
Now, had it remained the same,
then Damien Darhk would've...

256
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:47,578
He would've killed
not only you and your sister,

257
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,830
but your father as well.

258
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,959
But, Rip,

259
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:57,087
if we go back
and we take the team...

260
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,964
The outcome would
be exactly the same.

261
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:00,674
You don't know that.

262
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,176
I'm afraid that I do.

263
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:05,888
- No. There's gotta be a way.
- Uh...

264
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,682
Rip, I have to be able to
do something.

265
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,434
I'm so sorry.

266
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:19,860
Look, I can't...

267
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:23,280
I can't do this
without my sister. I can't--

268
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:24,657
Oh, yes, you can.

269
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:29,662
You are one of the strongest
people I have ever met, Sara.

270
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:35,000
Laurel... Laurel may be
beyond your saving,

271
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:39,046
but Kendra and Carter,

272
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:41,799
they might not be.

273
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:45,928
<i>Captain, we are prepared to make
the time jump to 1944.</i>

274
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:50,933
We're on our way, Gideon.

275
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:05,239
<i>We've arrived in Saint-Lô.</i>

276
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:08,200
<i>No sign of Kendra yet, but
I have located Vandal Savage.</i>

277
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:09,910
<i>And he does not seem
to be alone.</i>

278
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:45,029
<i>Get them!</i>

279
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:50,492
Keep Savage
and our Nazi friends occupied.

280
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,428
Gideon has detected
a temporal signature

281
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:53,829
consistent with a Timeship.

282
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:57,124
If Kendra and Carter are alive,
that is where they're gonna be.

283
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,293
Yeah, I see it.

284
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:12,389
- Jax!
- You miss me?

285
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,020
Is he still nuts?

286
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:20,648
No, he's okay.

287
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,735
Take this to the ship.

288
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,289
What the hell was that?

289
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,062
<i>You transmuted
the molecular properties of the rifle.</i>

290
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:43,170
What does that even mean?

291
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,047
Okay. Let's get out of here.

292
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,350
Kendra's down!

293
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,729
Rip, we're kind of
outnumbered here!

294
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,898
Fall back!
Staying here to fight Nazis

295
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,525
<i>is exacerbating the damage</i>

296
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,443
that we have already done
to the timeline.

297
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,196
- But Kendra--
- Is alive, thankfully.

298
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:10,948
And we will rescue her
in due course.

299
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:13,575
I hope.

300
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,631
So this is a spaceship?

301
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:31,260
It's a Timeship. But, yes, it
does also travel through space.

302
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:33,345
You've seen it before, Mr. Hall.

303
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:37,182
That used to be my name.
Carter Hall?

304
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,160
There really is
rather a lot to fill you in on

305
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,728
and we really
do not have the time.

306
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,229
- What about--
<i>- Kendra.</i>

307
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,457
Yes, we need your assistance
in locating her and Savage.

308
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:48,110
Perhaps we can start with what
Savage was doing in 1944.

309
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:52,281
He said something about, um,
Thanagarian technology...

310
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:53,657
"Thanagarian"?

311
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:56,118
The Thanagarians are a race
of extraterrestrials.

312
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,412
He also said that

313
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,497
this "technology"
was actually three meteors.

314
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,460
<i>Captain, I have surveillance
footage which might be relevant.</i>

315
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:05,753
Thank you, Gideon.

316
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:10,132
<i>I've seen that rock before.</i>

317
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:11,884
Savage had one of those in 1958.

318
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,635
He took our blood.

319
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:16,054
He said he would use it
in a ritual to erase time,

320
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,390
take the world back to 1700 BC.

321
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,731
What are you doing?

322
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:27,298
Come on, man.
We gotta try it again.

323
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,877
That thing that we did
in World War II?

324
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,445
- It's called "transmutation."
- Yeah.

325
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:32,881
<i>It's a similar process</i>

326
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:35,532
by which our uniform
materializes when we merge.

327
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:36,700
But at the moment,

328
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,107
we need to focus on figuring out
what Savage is planning.

329
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,455
Come on. Just the once.

330
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:46,126
Is that Raymond
and Kendra's lucky vase?

331
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,253
I don't know. I just
found this junk lying around.

332
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:50,214
Come on.

333
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,233
Don't you think that turning
something into something else

334
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,467
might come in handy?

335
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,471
All right. One time only.

336
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:58,764
Okay, just the once.

337
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:03,519
All right.

338
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,169
<i>You need to focus,
Jefferson.</i>

339
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:13,612
Why do you always say that
like I'm not focusing?

340
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:15,447
<i>Just do what you did before.</i>

341
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:19,159
Before, we had a Nazi trying
to kill us. This is just a vase.

342
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,792
Come on.

343
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,549
I never thought
I'd utter these words,

344
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,217
but I think we need a Nazi.

345
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:36,385
Not funny.

346
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,112
Look, the reason
I keep telling you to focus

347
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,972
is because transmutation
is a literal function

348
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,473
of mind over matter.

349
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,141
Dude, this sucks.

350
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:44,828
Why do I always gotta
be in the driver's seat?

351
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:45,936
Don't despair, Jefferson.

352
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,647
This is only our second attempt
at transmutation

353
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:52,192
and you know what they always
say, "The third time's a charm."

354
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,946
What?

355
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:57,656
The third time.

356
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,533
Three rituals.

357
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,743
I think I know what Savage
is planning to do.

358
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:09,710
I've figured out how
Savage plans to erase time.

359
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:12,254
I believe he intends to detonate
each of these meteors

360
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,089
in a different time period.

361
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,133
How can you destroy the world
three times

362
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,135
in three different times?

363
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,512
You can't. It would create
a temporal paradox.

364
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:21,999
Which would result
in a time-quake

365
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,219
that would return the Earth

366
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,809
to the point of the first
chrono-thermic reaction.

367
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,019
Ancient Egypt.

368
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,478
<i>Okay, it's official.</i>

369
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,355
This is
the craziest bad-guy plan

370
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:31,815
in the history of bad-guy plans.

371
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,609
I don't think
that sanity is a yardstick

372
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,295
by which Vandal Savage
can be measured.

373
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,964
Okay, so which time periods
are we talking here?

374
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,907
You said Savage
was in possession of

375
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,159
one of these meteorites in 1958.

376
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:44,220
<i>That was a year
of a rare alignment</i>

377
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,662
with the Earth and Thanagar.

378
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,332
Evidently, he got hold
of a second meteorite in 1944.

379
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,208
Which would be useless
to him in a year

380
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,502
where the Earth and Thanagar
weren't in alignment.

381
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,422
Now, if my math is correct,
and trust me, it is,

382
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:59,509
the next two years that Earth
and Thanagar are in sync

383
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:02,679
are 1975 and 2021.

384
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,724
But Savage still has to do this
in three different time periods?

385
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:10,270
That's the beauty of immortality,
Jefferson. He can.

386
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,941
<i>He can literally
be in three places at once.</i>

387
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,375
It can't be...

388
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,962
It can, thanks to time travel.

389
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:38,298
And it's because of time travel
that I know you're here.

390
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,716
<i>You're out here tonight</i>

391
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:43,929
because you've felt an imminent
presence of something.

392
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:46,598
Uh, a meteorite?

393
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,392
And I am going to give you
a use for it

394
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,728
which will give us the power
to rewrite destiny itself

395
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,982
and change the course
of the entire world.

396
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:14,084
So if Savage plans on blowing up
the world three times,

397
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,253
- how do we stop him?
- We don't.

398
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,981
<i>- We kill him.
- How?</i>

399
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,507
We've always known that only
you or Kendra could kill Savage

400
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:23,635
using items exposed, as you
were, to the meteors' radiation.

401
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:25,387
Now, the radiation
works both ways.

402
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:26,994
It gave Savage
his immortality, but--

403
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,016
It also makes him vulnerable.

404
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,935
<i>And Savage is about
to unleash the radiation</i>

405
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:35,230
from three meteorites
in three different time periods.

406
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:36,940
Triple the exposure.

407
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:41,278
Yes. Which should be sufficient
to render Savage mortal.

408
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:44,781
And then all we've gotta do
is kill Savage three times.

409
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,908
Indeed. Gideon can navigate
the <i>Waverider</i>

410
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:48,660
and we can split
into teams of two.

411
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:53,373
<i>One in 1958, one in 1975,
and one in 2021.</i>

412
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:57,961
Open it.

413
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,632
Did you know that this is
one of the original meteorites

414
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,218
which fell upon
the Middle Kingdom?

415
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:07,846
<i>Drawn from the ground
after millennia,</i>

416
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:10,640
<i>straight into Nazi hands.</i>

417
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,017
The object that has bound

418
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:13,810
the two of us together
for 4,000 years

419
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:18,231
has the power to take us back
to where it all began.

420
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:22,652
But this time,
I will be the pharaoh, and you--

421
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:26,198
Will hate you.
Like I've always hated you.

422
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:31,495
Patience, Mr. Hall.

423
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:34,414
<i>All our teams
need to act simultaneously.</i>

424
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,089
I think that's a comet
or something.

425
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:44,341
It's a meteorite,
point of fact.

426
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,177
I was drawn to it as well.

427
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:51,681
When can I kill him?

428
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:53,493
We have to wait for
the meteorite to go critical.

429
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:54,601
When's that?

430
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:57,049
When he starts the ritual
at all three time periods.

431
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:01,233
Um, we got a nuclear bomb here.

432
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,610
<i>Professor, Jax, we need you!</i>

433
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:09,074
Oh, man, I forgot
how much of a badass I was.

434
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:13,370
Look.

435
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:19,295
What do you mean,
you don't have the money?

436
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,128
I was going to
sell a nuclear warhead,

437
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:22,963
and pay you out of the profit.

438
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:25,132
Things changed.

439
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,384
You expect me to just hand
the meteor over for free?

440
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:44,234
No, I expect to
take it from you by force.

441
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,921
Oh!

442
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:06,882
I think that's our cue.

443
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:11,052
Really? These guys again?

444
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,265
Now.

445
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,271
Keep them occupied.

446
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:23,358
You ready to show these fools
what's really good?

447
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:24,733
You have no idea.

448
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,804
I'm glad we're past the point of
worrying about the timeline.

449
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:44,461
Carter!

450
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,604
Oh, you're too late.

451
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:04,981
A Time Master is never late.

452
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:22,290
Rip!

453
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,948
You can't kill me. I'm immortal.

454
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:38,687
Guess you haven't
heard the news.

455
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:44,289
Goodbye, my love.

456
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:03,391
You can feel it, can't you?
Things are different this time.

457
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:07,479
You're mortal.

458
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:12,609
But yet my death does not save
the lives of your family.

459
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,944
I may die,

460
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:19,115
but you will live knowing that
you failed to save the lives--

461
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,417
Never speak their names again.

462
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,154
Do something, RoboCop.

463
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:00,521
I'm on it. I've got a little
trick I've been working on.

464
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:14,342
<i>It's up to you now, Jefferson.</i>

465
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:17,549
Grey, listen, if we're gonna do this,
we gotta do it together.

466
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:19,551
It's gonna take the two of us,
all right?

467
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:21,277
<i>- You're right.</i>
- Okay.

468
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:25,682
Come on, Grey.

469
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:37,861
Oh, man, you got my boots wet.

470
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:41,197
<i>- Jefferson, you did it!</i>
- We did it, man.

471
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:43,074
<i>Gideon, take us back to Rip.</i>

472
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:58,715
Damn it! I wanted to be the one
to kill him.

473
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:00,758
Again, I mean.

474
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:04,512
Um...

475
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,198
I don't think
our problems are over yet.

476
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:14,898
I'm on it.

477
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:19,444
On what?

478
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:22,113
It's not working.

479
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,258
<i>The radiation buildup
is too progressive.</i>

480
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:25,283
I got this.

481
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:34,297
I don't understand.
I must be all out of power.

482
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:36,794
What happens
if only one of these goes off?

483
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:39,047
Time will remain intact.

484
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:42,926
The world, not so much.

485
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:51,434
Okay, guys, let's
fly this thing out of here.

486
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:54,103
To where? We would never get it
far enough away.

487
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:56,439
Maybe the <i>Waverider</i> can.

488
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:58,608
Rip, we need to-- Rip?

489
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:10,912
Rip, what are you doing?

490
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:15,124
I'm flying the <i>Waverider</i> into
the sun with the meteor onboard.

491
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,459
<i>And you on it.</i>

492
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,217
I guess this is goodbye.

493
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:29,087
It's been a pleasure, Captain.

494
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:30,848
Likewise, Dr. Palmer.

495
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:32,695
<i>But you brought us all
into this, man.</i>

496
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,311
Which is why I'm doing this
alone, Mr. Jackson.

497
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:37,438
I'll have no one else
die for my choices.

498
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:39,774
This isn't gonna
bring Snart back.

499
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,443
I don't wanna lose
another friend.

500
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:45,446
I appreciate that, Mr. Rory.

501
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:51,244
<i>I must say, it's been an honor
to serve as your cap--</i>

502
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,365
<i>Rip.</i>

503
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,329
<i>Daddy?</i>

504
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:53,640
Miranda?

505
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:49,445
I... Where...

506
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:51,864
<i>I'm still here, Captain.</i>

507
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:54,909
I know you are, Gideon.

508
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:59,247
<i>May I share something with you?
I'm not ready to die.</i>

509
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:03,084
Me neither.

510
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:07,630
Which reminds me, is our solar
array still functional?

511
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:10,216
<i>In fact, it's operating
at an efficiency rate</i>

512
00:34:10,383 --> 00:34:11,759
<i>of 12,000%.</i>

513
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:15,012
Transfer all available power
to the time drive,

514
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,514
get ready to eject the meteor

515
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:21,310
and pray that we have enough
power for one last jump.

516
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,649
What happens
if only one of these goes off?

517
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:28,151
Time will remain intact.

518
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,113
The world, not so much.

519
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,449
Okay, guys, let's
fly this thing out of here.

520
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:37,452
To where? We would never get it
far enough away.

521
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,036
Maybe the <i>Waverider</i> can.

522
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,747
Rip, we need... Where's Rip?

523
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,415
<i>And the meteorite.</i>

524
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,758
Will somebody please tell me
what just happened?

525
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:54,677
Rip?

526
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:57,388
Sorry if I gave you all
a fright.

527
00:34:57,555 --> 00:34:59,474
What happened to the meteor?

528
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,392
I flew it
into the heart of the sun.

529
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:04,520
Well, I angled the ship
to eject the meteorite

530
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:08,065
before impact
and then time-jumped away.

531
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:09,358
You could've been killed.

532
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:11,611
Should've been. You're a moron.

533
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:16,574
Now, who fancies
a return trip to 2016?

534
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,288
I can't believe it's over.

535
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:23,706
Well, for some of you, yes.

536
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:27,418
My journey, it seems,
is only just beginning.

537
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:30,838
How does that work?
Savage is three times dead.

538
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:32,924
The Time Masters are no longer
a going concern,

539
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,675
due to our destruction
of the Oculus.

540
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:38,471
Someone needs to be responsible
for protecting the timeline.

541
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:40,723
Who better
than a former Time Master?

542
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,060
And any of you
who'd like to join me.

543
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,625
I should stay
and help you with Darhk

544
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:10,962
and get justice for Laurel.

545
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,756
<i>That's happening,</i>

546
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,925
honey, with or without you.
I promise.

547
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:18,928
Now, listen, I can't
pretend to understand

548
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:20,346
this time-travel thing,

549
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:23,015
but it sounds important.

550
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,768
So is family.

551
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:39,448
I wasn't gonna
go the first time.

552
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:43,119
Then Laurel convinced me.

553
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:50,001
And now I'm gonna
do this for her.

554
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,173
Well, she'd be proud of you.

555
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,884
How do you know?

556
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,510
Because I am.

557
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:08,728
"What German loanword literally
means 'the desire to hike'?"

558
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:10,646
"Wanderlust."

559
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:12,148
A word which could also be used

560
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:14,150
to describe
that look in your eye.

561
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:16,736
What look in my eye?

562
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:19,155
Martin, we've been married
for 28 years

563
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:20,573
and you're still a lousy liar.

564
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,200
Now, about this
new sabbatical...

565
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:26,829
I've decided
to decline the invitation.

566
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,333
But I think you should.

567
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:33,336
I think it's important--

568
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:35,222
Clarissa, I'm not leaving you.
That's final.

569
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:39,842
- Hey, Grey.
- What are you...

570
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:41,729
Oh, I'm so glad
that you could make it, Jax.

571
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:42,929
What are you up to?

572
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:46,015
Well, we had a nice, long talk
this afternoon,

573
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:47,350
- didn't we?
- Yeah.

574
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:50,019
Oh, my God!
This is an intervention.

575
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:51,687
Yeah, you could
kind of call it that.

576
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:54,190
Listen, Grey,
you were meant for more

577
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:57,860
than sitting around,
answering trivia questions about history.

578
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:02,865
Me, you, Firestorm...
We're made for changing history.

579
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:04,825
This is my life.

580
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:08,162
And your life will be waiting
for you when you get back.

581
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:10,206
You really want me to do this?

582
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:14,418
I could never forgive myself
if I kept you from it.

583
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:17,046
My husband, the superhero.

584
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:48,202
Why are you
looking at me like that?

585
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:50,746
I wasn't sure you'd make it.

586
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:54,417
You left me a message, I came...
What of it?

587
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:57,586
I just wanted to talk.

588
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:03,592
You and I,
we've done a lot of thieving,

589
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:05,970
a lot of cool stuff,
a lot of fun.

590
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:13,978
Anyway, I just wanted to make
sure I said something important

591
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:16,731
that wasn't left unsaid.

592
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:20,776
Mick, I don't do touchy-feely.

593
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:23,988
If you got something to say,
say it.

594
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:27,783
This wasn't a good idea.

595
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,666
You're the best guy I ever knew.

596
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:41,297
You may not think you're a hero,
but you're a hero to me.

597
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:46,844
You got that?

598
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:49,972
Yeah, I got it.

599
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:52,475
See you around.

600
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:09,825
You okay?

601
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:12,036
Fine.

602
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:13,496
So, did you tell him?

603
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:16,123
That he killed himself
to save our destinies?

604
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,958
If it's any consolation,

605
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:21,962
I can always bring you back to
this particular time and place.

606
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:24,715
I'm fine. Just let it be.

607
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:41,398
A full complement.

608
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:43,835
To be honest, I had my doubts
that all of you would be willing

609
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:46,028
to throw in with me
for a second go.

610
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:48,989
- Well, actually--
- We're not coming with you.

611
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:53,702
With Savage gone, we wanna start fresh.
See what happens.

612
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:55,621
I give it three months. Tops.

613
00:40:57,331 --> 00:40:58,541
Look, I just...

614
00:41:00,126 --> 00:41:02,294
I wanna say thank you
to all of you.

615
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:06,048
- Ray, I--
- No.

616
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:08,551
This is... It's meant to be.

617
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:11,137
I wish both of you
nothing but the best.

618
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:21,480
Be safe.

619
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:23,899
See you guys around.

620
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:36,871
Every time they do that,
I get hungry for chicken.

621
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,917
So, shall we?

622
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:51,093
- Is that...
- The <i>Waverider.</i>

623
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,511
<i>Another</i> Waverider?

624
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:55,723
Whatever it is,
it's not slowing down!

625
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:57,892
Get down!

626
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:05,232
What the hell's going on?

627
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:08,569
To be honest, Mr. Jackson,
I have absolutely no idea.

628
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:17,119
Is this 2016?

629
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:21,040
Is this May 2016?

630
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:23,876
Yeah.

631
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:25,563
You're exactly
where you said you'd be.

632
00:42:27,755 --> 00:42:29,298
Do not get on that ship.

633
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:33,135
If you do, you're all dead.

634
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:36,222
Says who?

635
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,308
