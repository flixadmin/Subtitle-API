Valar dohaeris.

6
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,882
I've been sweeping
this floor for days.

7
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,216
Good.

8
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,468
I didn't come here
to sweep floors.

9
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,804
No?

10
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,764
Why come, then?

11
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,726
You said I could be
your apprentice.

12
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,353
You said you'd teach me
how to be a Faceless Man.

13
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,522
A man teaches a girl.

14
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,192
Valar dohaeris.

15
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,445
All men must serve.

16
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,530
Faceless Men
most of all.

17
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,826
I want to serve.

18
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,664
A girl wants
to serve herself.

19
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,125
Here we serve
the Many-Faced God.

20
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,710
To serve well,

21
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,004
a girl must become
no one.

22
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,714
Which one's
the Many-Faced God?

23
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,760
I see the Stranger.
I see the Drowned God.

24
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,345
I see the weirwood face.

25
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,805
There is only one god.

26
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,183
A girl knows his name.

27
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,185
And all men know his gift.

28
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,891
Where are they
taking him?

29

-<i> ( bells tolling )</i>
-<i> ( people shouting )</i>

30
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,871
( people shouting )
Queen Margaery!
Queen Margaery!

31
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,045
Man:
<i>Queen Margaery!</i>

32
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,466
Queen Margaery!

33

<i>Queen Margaery!</i>

-<i> I am his and he is mine.</i>
-<i> I am hers and she is mine.</i>

35
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:55,022
Both:
<i>From this day</i>
<i>until the end of my days.</i>

36
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,974
( breathing heavily )

37
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,484
Did I hurt you?

38
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,778
No.
You were lovely.

39
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,989
- It all happened so fast.
- Yes. ( chuckles )

40
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,908
I was scared
maybe I hurt you.

41
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,827
- It sounded like--
- No, no, no.

42
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,245
You're very sweet.

43
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,749
The sweetest king
who ever lived.

44
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,002
This is all I want
to do all day,

45
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,754
every day,
for the rest of my life.

46
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,507
( laughs )
Wouldn't that
be glorious?

47
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,551
Shouldn't we rest
a little while?

48
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,262
Just to catch our breath?
There's no rush, is there?

49
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,640
Of course not.

50
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,266
Are you hungry?

51
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,769
Should I have them
bring you some cake
or pomegranate juice?

52
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,687
No, I'm fine.

53
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,690
I just want you
all to myself.

54
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,068
I want to know everything
there is to know

55
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,363
about King Tommen,
First of His Name.

56
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,406
King Tommen.

57
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,284
Still sounds
strange to me.

58
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,079
Does Queen Margaery
sound strange to you?

59
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,040
So strange.

60
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,042
- Husband.
- Wife.

61
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,919
( laughs )

62
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,589
Sometimes it feels odd.

63
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,258
I'm the king,

64
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:50,345
I've married the most
beautiful woman
in the world,

65
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,557
and it's all because
my brother died.

66
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,684
I understand.

67
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,104
But it's not your fault.
You know that, don't you?

68
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,022
You mustn't
feel guilty.

69
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,776
I don't feel guilty.

70
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,444
That's what's odd.

71
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,949
Do you like to sail?

72
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,993
I love to sail.

73
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,078
I do, too.

74
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,415
I think we're going
to be very happy,
you and I.

75
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,876
I do, too.

76
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,587
( kisses )

77
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:29,092
Living in a tower
so high it touches
the clouds.

78
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,928
Of course, my grandmother
couldn't wait to go home.

79
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,848
The capital's not
for everyone, I suppose.

80
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,811
Does your mother
like it here?

81
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,605
I don't think so.

82
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,357
She told me
never to trust anyone
in King's Landing.

83
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,112
It's so wonderful to have
her watching over you.

84
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,907
A lioness
guarding her cub.

85
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,534
Well, but I'm a man now.

86
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,206
You are.

87
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,083
And the king.

88
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,297
But you'll always be
her baby boy.

89
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,550
- I suppose.
-<i> I adore her.</i>

90
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:14,888
She's always been
so generous with me,
so kind.

91
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,723
And the horrors
she's had to endure--

92
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,602
losing her husband,
her eldest child,
and her father.

93
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,230
It's no wonder
she's so protective
of you.

94
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,066
She'll never let you
out of her sight.

95
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,613
Cersei:
You look
very much in love.

96
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,907
The first days of marriage
are often so blissful.

97
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,786
She's certainly
very pretty, isn't she?

98
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,246
Like a doll.

99
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,373
She smiles quite a lot.

100
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,335
Do you think
she's intelligent?

101
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,921
I can't quite tell.

102
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,673
Not that it matters.

103
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,174
Do you ever miss
Casterly Rock?

104
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,927
There's nothing for me
in Casterly Rock.

105
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,264
That's where
you grew up.

106
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,225
You always told me
that you liked the people
there better.

107
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,812
You said that King's Landing
smelled of horse dung
and sour milk.

108
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,690
( chuckles )

109
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,775
Why are we speaking
of Casterly Rock?

110
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,778
The way that
you talked about it,

111
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,905
I always thought
that you missed it,

112
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:17,075
that you--
that it was
your real home.

113
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:21,371
This is my real home now,
where my family lives.

114
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,873
I want you
to be happy, Mother.

115
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,335
I know that.

116
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:28,837
I know you do.

117
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,380
My sweet boy.

118
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,632
But wouldn't
you be happier
in Casterly Rock?

119
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,471
Margaery:
<i>I said, "Darling,</i>
<i>surely four times is enough."</i>

-<i> "Are you trying to set</i>
<i>a new record?"</i>

121
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,394
He said,

I'm sure we can break it."

122
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,396
( laughing )

123
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,401
Mother.

124
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,820
Welcome.

125
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,739
Don't you look lovely?

126
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,157
Marriage agrees with you.

127
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,743
Can we bring you
anything to eat or drink?

128
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,494
I wish we had
some wine for you.

129
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,455
It's a bit early
in the day for us.

130
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:08,376
No, no,
I can't stay.

131
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,046
I just wanted
to let you know

132
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,423
if there's ever anything
I can do for you...

133
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,091
You are very sweet.

134
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,510
Tommen seems
quite taken with
his new queen.

135
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,722
I absolutely adore him.

136
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,432
You raised
a gallant young man.

137
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,017
I'm forever grateful.

138
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,102
Good.

139
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,022
Good.
I'm glad to hear
you're happy.

140
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,316
Ecstatic.
I really am.

141
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,276
Exhausted,
to be honest.

142
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,197
But what could I expect?
He is half lion, half stag.

143
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,407
( women laugh )

144
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,326
I'll leave you
to it, then.

145
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,744
Oh, forgive me.

146
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,496
I haven't been
at court for long.

147
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,872
I get so confused.

148
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,124
What's the proper way
to address you now?

149
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,877
Queen Mother
or Dowager Queen?

150
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,130
There's no need
for such formalities.

151
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,467
In any event, judging from
the king's enthusiasm,

152
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,136
the Queen Mother will be
a Queen Grandmother soon.

153
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,554
Won't that be
a lovely day?

154
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,306
Can you imagine
the celebrations?

155
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,809
They'll ring the bells
all day and night.

156
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,144
Remember...

157
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,230
anything you need.

158

( men shouting )

163
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,014
( animals squawking )

164
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,629
<i>( flies buzzing )</i>

165
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,722
( caws )

166
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,057
Roose:
<i>We can't hold the North</i>
<i>with terror alone.</i>

167
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,602
Ramsay:<i> You can't hold</i>
<i>the North if you let these</i>
<i>lesser lords insult us.</i>

168
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,313
Roose: I sent you there
to collect taxes,
not bodies.

169
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,648
Ramsay:
<i>Lord Cerwyn refused to pay.</i>

170
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,651
Said the Warden of the North
would always be a Stark

171
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,404
and he'd be damned if he'd
kiss a traitor's boot.

172
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,783
Roose:
<i>He left you no choice.</i>

173
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:49,954
I flayed him living
along with his wife
and brother.

174
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,332
Made his son watch.

175
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,709
And?

176
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,003
The new Lord Cerwyn
paid his taxes.

177
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,845
I've something important
to tell you.

178
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,599
Stop eating
and listen.

179
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,276
We don't have enough men
to hold the North

180
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,862
if the other houses
rise up against us.

181
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,280
Do you understand that?

182
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,199
Our pact with
the Lannisters protects--

183
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,201
I had a pact
with Tywin Lannister.

184
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,537
And Tywin Lannister is dead.

185
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,040
The remaining Lannisters
are a thousand miles away
dealing with that fact.

186
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,709
<i>They've never</i>
<i>once in the history</i>
<i>of the Seven Kingdoms</i>

187
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,628
sent their army
this far north.

188
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,880
If you think
they will for us,
you're a fool.

189
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,800
<i>We've become</i>
<i>a great house</i>

190
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,969
<i>by entering into alliances</i>
<i>with other houses</i>

191
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,264
and parlaying
those alliances
into greater power.

192
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,975
The best way to forge
a lasting alliance

193
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,811
isn't by peeling
a man's skin off.

194
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,313
The best way is marriage.

195
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,358
Now that you're a Bolton
by royal decree,

196
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,194
it's high time you married
a suitable bride.

197
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,658
And as it happens,

198
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:12,579
I've found the perfect
girl to solidify our
hold on the North.

199
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,685
That's Moat Cailin.

200
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,188
Yes, a bit shabby,
isn't it?

201
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,357
You've been here before?

202
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,359
On our way down
to King's Landing

203
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,195
with my father
and Arya.

204
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,989
Where are you taking me?

205
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,532
Home.

206
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,119
The Boltons
have Winterfell.

207
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,208
Your marriage proposal,
it wasn't for you.

208
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,295
No.

209
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,381
Roose Bolton
murdered my brother.

210
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,258
He betrayed my family.

211
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,676
He did.

212
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,553
He serves
the Lannisters.

213
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,013
For now.

214
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,724
- I won't go.
- Winterfell is your home.

215
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,768
- Not anymore.
- Always.

216
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,812
You're a Stark.
Dying your hair
doesn't change that.

217
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:24,651
You're Sansa Stark,
eldest surviving child
of Ned and Catelyn Stark.

218
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,319
<i>Your place</i>
<i>is in the North.</i>

219
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,404
I can't marry him.
You can't make me.

220
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,698
He is a traitor.
A murderer!

221
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,700
You're not marrying
Roose Bolton.

222
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,912
No, you'll be marrying
his son and heir Ramsay.

223
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,955
One day he'll be
Warden of the North
and you--

224
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,374
- No.
- Sansa.

225
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,085
No, you can't make me.
I will starve myself.

226
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,253
I will die before
I have to go there.

227
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,382
I won't force you
to do anything.

228
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,927
Don't you know by now
how much I care for you?

229
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,804
Say the word and we turn
the horses around,

230
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,390
but listen to me.
Listen.

231
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,601
You've been running
all your life.

232
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,270
Terrible things
happen to your family
and you weep.

233
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,774
You sit alone
in a darkened room
mourning their fates.

234
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,986
You've been a bystander
to tragedy from the day
they executed your father.

235
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,781
Stop being a bystander.
Do you hear me?

236
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,282
Stop running.

237
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,748
There's no justice
in the world.

238
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,042
Not unless we make it.

239
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,838
You loved your family.

240
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,258
Avenge them.

241
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,049
<i>( horse neighs )</i>

242
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,801
Man:
<i>Banners!</i>

243
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,278
How do we
get through there?

244
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,780
We don't.

245
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,698
We go around.

246
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,992
Takes us miles
out of the way.

247
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,535
We'll lose sight
of them.

248
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,870
Brienne:
Doesn't matter.

249
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,455
I know where
they're going.

250
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,961
Aren't you getting
a bit old to be a squire?

251
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,301
How did you end up
squiring for the Imp?

252
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,053
He hates that nickname.

253
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,847
Well, he's not here
to complain about it, is he?

254
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,229
I squired for a knight
named Ser Lorimer

255
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,939
during the War
of the Five Kings.

256
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,983
One night he had
a bit too much to drink

257
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,736
and he was famished,
so he borrowed a ham.

258
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,363
He borrowed it?

259
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,739
He wasn't a thief.

260
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,741
He was drunk and hungry
and he wasn't thinking.

261
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,785
<i>I was drunk, too.</i>

262
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,205
He gave me half the ham.

263
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:28,167
Next morning,
one of the guards
saw him passed out

264
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:31,546
<i>under a wagon</i>
<i>with the hambone</i>
<i>still in his hand.</i>

265
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,382
They hanged him
that afternoon.

266
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,968
They tied the noose
for me, too,

267
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,929
<i>but Lord Tywin heard</i>
<i>my family name was Payne,</i>

268
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,639
so he pardoned me

269
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,767
and sent me
to King's Landing
to squire for his son.

270
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,728
As punishment
for both of you.

271
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,230
It didn't seem
that way.

272
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,274
Lord Tyrion was always
very good to me.

273
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,734
Yes, all your lords
have been very kind to you.

274
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,153
All except me.

275
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,780
Sorry you had to squire
for such a nasty person.

276
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:01,033
I'm not sorry.
You're the best fighter
I've ever seen.

277
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,744
You beat the Hound.

278
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,872
I'm proud to be
your squire.

279
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,879
I'm sorry I'm always
snapping at you.

280
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,381
If you didn't snap at me,
I wouldn't learn anything.

281
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,387
You want to be
a knight, Pod?

282
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,264
Yes.

283
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,058
<i>Starting tomorrow,</i>
<i>we'll train with a sword</i>
<i>twice a day.</i>

284
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:29,687
Before we ride in the morning
and after you make camp
in the evening.

285
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,648
- And I'm going to show you
how to ride properly.
- Thank you.

286
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,443
I can't knight you,
but I can teach you
how to fight.

287
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,403
I suppose that's
more important.

288
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:53,169
You weren't a knight,
but you were a Kingsguard

289
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,588
to Renly Baratheon,
weren't you?

290
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,256
I was.

291
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,926
Lord Tyrion said
he was a good man.

292
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,471
He was.

293
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,599
How did you end up
serving Renly?

294
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,608
When I was a girl,
my father held a ball.

295
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:19,695
I'm his only living child,
so he wanted to make
a good match for me.

296
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,198
He invited dozens
of young lords to Tarth.

297
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,242
I didn't want to go,
but he dragged me
to the ballroom.

298
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,581
And it was wonderful.

299
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,963
None of the boys
noticed how mulish
and tall I was.

300
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,423
They shoved each other
and threatened to duel

301
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,926
when they thought
it was their turn to dance.

302
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,054
They whispered in my ear

303
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,891
how they wanted
to marry me and take me
back to their castles.

304
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,980
My father smiled at me
and I smiled at him.

305
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,984
I had never been so happy.

306
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,823
Till I saw a few
of the boys snickering.

307
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,159
And then they all
started to laugh.

308
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:10,079
They couldn't keep
the game going any longer.

309
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,332
They were toying with me.

310
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,793
"Brienne the Beauty"
they called me.

311
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,295
Great joke.

312
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:22,133
And I realized I was
the ugliest girl alive.

313
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,845
A great lumbering beast.

314
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,767
I tried to run away,

315
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:35,021
but Renly Baratheon
took me in his arms.

316
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,232
"Don't let them
see your tears,"
he told me.

317
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,026
"They're nasty
little shits

318
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:43,988
and nasty little shits
aren't worth crying over."

319
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:47,199
He danced with me
and none of the other
boys could say a word.

320
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,953
Renly was the king's
brother after all.

321
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,541
But wasn't he...?

322
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:00,254
Lord Tyrion
said he was...

323
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,674
Yes, Pod, he liked men.
I'm not an idiot.

324
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:05,634
He didn't love me.
He didn't want me.

325
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,678
He danced with me
because he was kind

326
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,014
and didn't want
to see me hurt.

327
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,142
He saved me
from being a joke.

328
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,854
From that day
until his last day.

329
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,859
And I couldn't
save him in return.

330
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:28,949
Nothing's more hateful
than failing to protect
the one you love.

331
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,080
One day I will avenge
King Renly.

332
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:37,124
But you said a shadow
murdered him.

333
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,501
How do you fight a shadow?

334
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:42,254
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

335
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,883
I know it was Stannis.
I know it in my heart.

336
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,806
Stannis is a man,
not a shadow.

337
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:55,893
And a man can be killed.

338
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,190
- Lord Commander.
- Your Grace.

339
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,858
I'd like to speak alone.

340
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,277
Olly is my steward now

341
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,571
as I was
Lord Commander Mormont's.

342
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:12,618
I want him to attend
my meetings to learn
from men with experience.

343
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,205
One day he might command.

344
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,210
Very well.

345
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,254
Have you considered
my offer?

346
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:25,881
I have.

347
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,759
And I thank you for it.
You do me great honor.

348
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:31,720
All my life I wanted
to be Jon Stark.

349
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,430
Say the word
and you will be.

350
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:37,143
But I have to refuse you.

351
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,105
I'm Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

352
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,023
My place is here.

353
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:46,443
I'm giving you the chance
to avenge your family,

354
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:49,196
to take back the castle
where you grew up.

355
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,492
To rule the North.

356
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:55,828
I wish I could fight
beside you.

357
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,830
Believe me, I do.

358
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,958
But I swore a sacred vow
at the godswood.

359
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,295
I pledged my life
to the Night's Watch.

360
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:07,298
You're as stubborn
as your father.

361
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,924
And as honorable.

362
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,718
I can imagine
no higher praise.

363
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,428
I didn't mean it
as praise.

364
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,930
Honor got
your father killed.

365
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,016
But if your mind's made up,
I won't try and dissuade you.

366
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:20,728
May I ask, Your Grace,
how long you plan to stay
at Castle Black?

367
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:23,439
Are you bored
of us already?

368
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,025
You saved us
from Mance Rayder's army.

369
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,276
We will never forget that.

370
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,612
But it's a question
of survival.

371
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,198
<i>The Night's Watch can't</i>
<i>continue to feed your men</i>

372
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,492
and the wildling
prisoners indefinitely.

373
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,203
Winter is coming.

374
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:40,247
I know it.

375
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,416
We march on Winterfell
within the fortnight,

376
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,585
before the snows
trap us here.

377
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,254
And the wildlings?

378
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:49,506
If they'd rather burn
than fight for me,
so be it.

379
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,675
I leave their fate to you.

380
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,887
You could execute them.
That's the safest course.

381
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,851
Or you could see
if this Tormund fellow

382
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:03,646
is more willing to compromise
than Mance ever was.

383
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,147
I assume the brothers
of the Night's Watch

384
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,441
would rather see
the wildlings dead.

385
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,194
Most of the brothers, yes.

386
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,655
<i>There's little love</i>
<i>for the free folk here.</i>

387
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:16,450
You're the Lord Commander.
Your decision.

388
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,785
<i>( door opens )</i>

389
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,620
You have many enemies
in Castle Black.

390
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,539
Have you considered
sending Alliser Thorne
elsewhere?

391
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:26,085
Give him command
of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

392
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,879
I heard it was best
to keep your enemies close.

393
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:31,340
Whoever said that
didn't have many enemies.

394
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,892
Davos:
<i>He sees something in you.</i>

395
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:45,187
Might not be apparent
from his tone,

396
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,730
but it's the truth.

397
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:47,982
He believes in you.

398
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,276
I'm sorry
I disappointed him.

399
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:57,658
The king
is a complicated man,

400
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,035
but he wants
to do what's right
for the Seven Kingdoms.

401
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,537
As long
as he's ruling them.

402
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,789
He's the one true king.

403
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,874
He has a blood right
to that throne.

404
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:09,753
I've sworn to stay
clear of the politics
of the Seven Kingdoms.

405
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,297
Have you now?

406
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,719
How does the Night's
Watch vow go again?

407
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,305
I'll bet you've
got it memorized
since you got here.

408
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,393
Night gathers
and now my watch begins.

409
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,688
No, not that bit.
The bit at the end.

410
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,357
I am the sword
in the darkness,

411
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:32,067
the watcher
on the walls,

412
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,236
the shield that guards
the realms of men.

413
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,697
-<i> I pledge my life--</i>
- Right, that's enough.

414
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,700
The shield that guards
the realms of men.

415
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,993
That's what
you swore to be.

416
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,911
Now, I'm not
a learned man,

417
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,456
but the best way
to help the most people
might not be sitting

418
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,666
in a frozen castle
at the edge of the world.

419
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,002
It just might mean
wading in the muck,

420
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,670
getting
your boots dirty

421
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:53,714
and doing what needs
to be done.

422
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,132
And what needs
to be done?

423
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,426
As long as the Boltons
rule the North,

424
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,178
the North will suffer.

425
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,264
Just one man's opinion.

426
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,482
<i>( door closes )</i>

Who are you?

430
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,759
- What?
- You, who walk in here

431
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,427
with a coin
you never earned

432
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,554
whose value
you do not respect.

433
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,186
Who are you?

434
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:53,315
No one.

435
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,692
Ow! Cunt!

436
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,903
A lie.
A sad little lie.
Who are you?

437
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,822
I told you, I'm no--

438
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,074
Do that again, and--

439
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,659
Who are you?

440
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,911
You're about to find out.

441
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,872
What are you doing?

442
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,625
We were only playing.
The Game of Faces.

443
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,378
- A girl is not ready.
- Clearly not.

444
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,005
I am ready!

445
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,465
For what?

446
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:20,050
For whatever you want.

447
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:23,053
To be a Faceless Man.
To be no one.

448
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,018
Jaqen:
<i>Whose sword is that?</i>

449
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,437
It belongs to Arya Stark.

450
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,981
Arya Stark's sword,
Arya Stark's clothes,

451
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,774
Arya Stark's stolen silver.

452
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:40,112
A man wonders
how is it that no one

453
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,407
came to be surrounded
by Arya Stark's things.

454

May I introduce my son

It's an honor

473
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,752
He's not feeling well.

474
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,087
Take good care of him.

475
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,049
- Brothers.
- ( chatter stops )

476
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:20,262
As you all know too well,
it's long past time to dig
a new latrine pit.

477
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,180
( men laugh )

478
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,726
First Builder Yarwyck and I
have decided to appoint

479
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,771
a latrine captain
to oversee this crucial task.

480
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,940
<i>( men laugh )</i>

481
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:38,947
Brian.

482
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,824
Seems like a good job
for a ginger.

483
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,368
( men laugh )

484
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,873
- That's him!
- That's him.

485
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,625
Ser Alliser.

486
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,090
<i>You have more experience</i>
<i>than any other ranger</i>
<i>at Castle Black.</i>

487
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,634
You proved your valor
many times over

488
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,012
while defending the Wall
from the wildling attack.

489
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,142
I name you First Ranger.

490
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,436
Men:
Hear, hear!

491
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,022
( pounding on tables )

492
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,734
Jon:
<i>Lord Janos.</i>

493
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,569
I'm giving you command
of Greyguard.

494
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,697
Greyguard is a ruin.

495
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,616
Yes, the fort
is in a sorry state.

496
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,075
Restore it as best you can.

497
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,161
First Builder Yarwyck
can spare 10 of his--

498
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,121
Slynt:<i> I was charged</i>
<i>with the defense</i>
<i>of King's Landing</i>

499
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,290
when you were soiling
your swaddling clothes.

500
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,499
Keep your ruin.

501
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,169
( men shouting )

502
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,796
- All right, all right!
- ( shouting stops )

503
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,798
Enough of that.

504
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,425
You mistake me, my lord.

505
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,846
That was a command,
not an offer.

506
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,850
Pack your arms and armor,
say your farewells,

507
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,269
and ride for Greyguard.

508
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,191
I will not go meekly off
to freeze and die.

509
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,235
Give it to one
of the fools who cast
a stone for you.

510
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:02,030
I will not have it.
Did you hear me, boy?

511
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,823
I will not have it!

512
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:06,785
Are you refusing
to obey my order?

513
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:15,460
You can stick your order
up your bastard ass.

514
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,587
<i>( men murmuring )</i>

515
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,260
Take Lord Janos outside.

516
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,306
Olly, bring me my sword.

517
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,247
- Dolorous Edd: Get out.
- Slynt: You cannot do this!

518
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,915
<i>Get your hands off me!</i>

519
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,042
<i>Scum, all of you!</i>

520
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,341
If the boy thinks
he can frighten me,
he's mistaken.

521
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:05,385
Yes, very mistaken.

522
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,055
Disgrace!

523
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:10,390
I have friends.

524
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,891
Important friends
in the capital.

525
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,185
- You'll see.
- Kneel!

526
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,973
If you have any
last words, my lord,

527
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,850
now's the time.

528
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:59,064
I was wrong.
You're the Lord Commander.

529
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,982
<i>We all serve you.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

530
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,860
<i>Not only for this,</i>
<i>for all I've done</i>
<i>and said.</i>

531
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:08,490
I was wrong.

532
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,785
My lord, please!
Mercy! Mercy!

533
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,828
I'll go! I will!
( sobbing )

534
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,371
<i>Please.</i>

535
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,165
I'm afraid.

536
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,833
<i>( whimpering )</i>

537
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,211
I've always been afraid.

538
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,379
( sobbing )

539
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,113
<i>( women giggling )</i>

540
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:08,174
You have served
us well, my son.

541
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:09,676
Thank you, Father.

542
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:12,804
Which of the Seven
will you worship today?

543
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:17,058
- The Maiden.
- Always the Maiden.

544
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:18,852
High Septon:
<i>And the Stranger.</i>

545
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:22,230
- Two is extra,
you realize?
- Yes, yes.

546
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,149
( snaps fingers )

547
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,826
- ( gasps )
- What are you doing?

548
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,579
This establishment belongs
to Lord Petyr Baelish.

549
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:38,830
You can't--
( groans )

550
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,748
You have profaned
our faith,

551
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,751
the faith of our fathers
and forefathers.

552
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,837
I am the High Septon
of the--

553
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,089
- You are a sinner.
- ( groans )

554
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:50,675
And you shall
be punished.

555
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:02,937
- ( cracks )
- Ah!

556
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,731
<i>( woman laughs )</i>

557
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,649
- Sinner.
- Sparrows: Sinner.

558
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,110
- Sparrows: Sinner. Sinner.
- Man:<i> Repent!</i>

559
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,946
- Sinner. Sinner.
- ( groans )

560
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,616
Sinner. Sinner.

561
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:17,535
- Man #2:<i> Shame on you.</i>
- Sparrows: Sinner. Sinner.

562
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,294
<i>( doors close )</i>

563
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:30,089
Your Grace,
Grand Maester,

564
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:33,092
Lord Tyrell, uh...

565
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,345
It doesn't matter.

566
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,931
As the High Septon
of the Faith of the Seven,

567
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,682
I give voice
to the will of the gods

568
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:42,727
and am their
foremost servant
in this world.

569
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,855
An insult to me
is an insult to the gods.

570
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:48,441
An assault
on my person

571
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,318
is an assault
on our very religion.

572
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,819
- You were assaulted?
- I was.

573
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,447
By those fanatics
who call themselves sparrows.

574
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,616
<i>They humiliated me,</i>
<i>they beat me,</i>

575
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,827
<i>they left me</i>
<i>naked and bleeding</i>
<i>on the cobblestones.</i>

576
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,287
I am lucky to be alive.

577
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:04,332
I heard this assault began
in Littlefinger's brothel.

578
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,127
High Septon,
this is a rather
shocking thing to hear.

579
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:11,047
High Septon:<i> I tend</i>
<i>to both the highest born</i>
<i>and the lowliest amongst us.</i>

580
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,549
Even prostitutes may earn
the mercy of the Mother.

581
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:17,428
So you were ministering
to the needs of these
devout prostitutes?

582
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:20,306
A man's private affairs
ought to stay private.

583
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,102
What do you want from us,
High Septon?

584
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,854
Justice.
I ask that you
protect our faith

585
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:30,650
by arresting these
criminals and throwing
them in the black cells.

586
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,694
<i>I ask that you execute</i>
<i>their leader,</i>

587
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,654
<i>this so-called</i>
<i>High Sparrow.</i>

588
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,781
He's a threat to everything
we hold sacred.

589
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,909
- If he goes unpunished--
- And where do I find
this man?

590
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:41,953
This High Sparrow?

591
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,589
I don't think this is
a good idea, Your Grace.

592
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:56,759
Nonsense, Ser Meryn.
These are deeply
religious people.

593
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:59,053
Where can I find
the High Sparrow?

594
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,890
Man:
<i>Seven blessings.</i>

595
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,893
- ( people coughing )
-<i> ( flies buzzing )</i>

596
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10,148
<i>( baby crying )</i>

597
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,739
- Man:<i> Thank you.</i>
- Man #2:<i> Just a little more.</i>

598
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,365
<i>( baby continues crying )</i>

599
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:21,159
Woman:
<i>Thank you.</i>

600
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:25,621
Man #3:
Thank you.

601
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:28,207
A young man said I'd find
the High Sparrow back here.

602
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:31,085
- Where is he?
- High Sparrow?

603
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,712
Sounds ridiculous,
doesn't it?

604
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:36,257
Like Lord Duckling
or King Turtle.

605
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:38,009
Still, it's meant to.

606
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,262
We're often
stuck with the names
our enemies give to us.

607
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:44,849
The notion
that we're all equal
in the eyes of the Seven

608
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,768
doesn't sit well
with some,

609
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,269
so they belittle me.

610
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:49,687
Woman #2:
<i>Seven blessings to you.</i>

611
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:52,273
Seven blessings
to you, my dear.

612
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:53,733
It's only a name.

613
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,110
Quite an easy
burden to bear.

614
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,196
Far easier
than hers.

615
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,825
Cersei:
<i>Why no shoes?</i>

616
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:06,496
Because I gave
them away to someone
who needed them more.

617
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:07,955
We all do that.

618
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,709
It stops us from forgetting
what we really are.

619
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:14,337
Is that why you came
to King's Landing?

620
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,963
To remind everyone?

621
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,133
Everyone?
Hard enough job
reminding myself.

622
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:21,260
Well, I tell them
no one's special

623
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:23,888
and they think I'm special
for telling them so.

624
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:27,809
Perhaps they're right.

625
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:31,687
It would be comforting
to believe that,
wouldn't it?

626
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:35,817
Have the gods sent
you here to tempt me?

627
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,902
I hope not.

628
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:42,281
I had assumed
you'd only come here
to arrest me

629
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,909
for that incident
with the High Septon.

630
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,703
An unacceptable way
to treat the chosen
representative

631
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:50,331
of the gods in this world,
wouldn't you say?

632
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:52,750
Hypocrisy is a boil.

633
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:55,878
Lancing a boil
is never pleasant.

634
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:59,924
Although they could
have been more careful
with the blade.

635
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,052
The High Septon came
to speak to me today.

636
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,013
He doesn't want me
to arrest you.

637
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:07,515
He wants me
to execute you.

638
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,812
I wouldn't presume
to know your thoughts
on the matter.

639
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,360
My thoughts on the matter
are in line with your own.

640
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:23,781
The High Septon's
behavior was corrosive,
as was his attitude.

641
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:27,869
Having a man like that
reside in the sept eats away
at the faith from the inside.

642
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:32,457
So now he resides
in the Red Keep dungeons
instead.

643
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,127
The faith and the crown
are the two pillars

644
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,712
that hold up this world.

645
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,839
One collapses,
so does the other.

646
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:45,636
We must do
everything necessary
to protect one another.

647
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:51,851
( squeaking )

648
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,986
-<i> ( flesh squelches )</i>
-<i> ( rat squeals )</i>

649
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,574
- Your Grace.
-<i> Send a raven</i>
<i>with this message</i>

650
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:10,161
to Littlefinger
at the Eyrie or wherever
he's slithering about.

651
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,958
At once, Your Grace.

652
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,460
How's your work
coming along?

653
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,920
Very well.

654
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,755
You've made progress?

655
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,256
More than I expected.

656
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,592
- Still a way
to go, but...
- Very good.

657
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,594
I'll leave you
to it, then.

658
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:31,182
Make sure Littlefinger
is clear on the meaning
of the word "immediately."

659
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,863
( bottles rattle )

660
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:49,242
Shh.

661
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,370
Easy, friend.

662
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,041
( people shouting )

663
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,770
Ramsay:
She really is lovely.

664
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,439
I hope I can
make her happy.

665
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:22,608
I hope so, too.

666
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:26,487
I've become quite fond
of Lady Sansa during
our travels together.

667
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:28,823
She's suffered enough.

668
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,783
I'll never hurt her.

669
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,368
You have my word.

670
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,206
I've heard very little
about you,

671
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:40,585
which makes you
quite a rare thing
as lords go.

672
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,171
I haven't been
a lord very long.

673
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,090
I was a bastard.

674
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,384
And you're not
anymore.

675
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,345
Allow me a moment alone
with Lord Baelish.

676
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,847
Yes, Father.

677
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,473
And thank you,
Lord Baelish.

678
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,851
I'm forever
in your debt.

679
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,900
He seems pleased.

680
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:07,320
Shouldn't he be?

681
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,280
I assure you,
she's still a virgin.

682
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,616
Tyrion never consummated
the marriage.

683
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,118
By the law of the land,
she is no man's wife.

684
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:16,704
Inspect her if you must.

685
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,623
I'll leave that
to the brothel keeper.

686
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,583
It's her name I need,
not her virtue.

687
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,127
Then I have delivered
everything I promised.

688
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,547
And you're prepared
for the consequences

689
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:29,216
when the Lannisters hear
I've wed Sansa Stark
to Ramsay?

690
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,094
The Lannister name
doesn't mean what
it once did.

691
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,804
Tywin is dead.

692
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:36,557
He kept his house in power
through sheer will.

693
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:40,061
Without him,
Jaime has one hand
and no allies.

694
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,188
Tommen is a soft boy,

695
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:44,690
not a king to fear.

696
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:46,400
The queen
will be enraged.

697
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,320
<i>Queen Margaery</i> adores Sansa.

698
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,072
Cersei is Queen Mother,

699
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:54,075
a title whose importance
wanes with each passing day.

700
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:55,868
And yet she still
has friends,

701
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:59,330
men in important places
whom she can ask
for favors.

702
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:03,250
A message for you
from Cersei Lannister.

703
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,587
A rider arrived
from the Eyrie shortly
before dawn.

704
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:08,756
Apparently she thinks
you're still in the Vale.

705
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:12,051
A message for me,
you say?

706
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,761
Strange that the seal
is broken.

707
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,138
I'm sure you understand
my position, Lord Baelish.

708
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:19,100
If you receive
word in the night
from the Queen Mother,

709
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,852
it does make me question
our new alliance.

710
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:25,981
The Lannisters made you
one of the great lords
of Westeros,

711
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:29,151
yet here you
are in the North
undermining them.

712
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:31,028
Why gamble
with your position?

713
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,615
Every ambitious move
is a gamble.

714
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:38,452
You gambled
when you drove a dagger
into Robb Stark's heart.

715
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,873
It appears that
your gamble paid off.

716
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:44,542
You're Warden
of the North.

717
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,544
I had Tywin Lannister's
backing.

718
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:49,088
Who supports me now?
You?

719
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,424
The Eyrie is mine.

720
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,718
The last time
the lords of the Eyrie

721
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,970
formed an alliance
with the lords of the North,

722
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:59,390
they brought down
the greatest dynasty
this world has ever known.

723
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:05,271
I'd like to borrow
one of your birds.

724
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:07,481
Cersei will expect a reply.

725
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:09,900
I'd like to read
the reply.

726
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:34,425
I have to get out
of this wheelhouse.

727
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,843
Volantis is a large city.

728
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,887
I have to get out
of this wheelhouse.

729
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,599
The likelihood
of you being spotted here
increases a hundredfold.

730
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,684
Mm, I have to get out
of this wheelhouse.

731
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:46,896
( sighs )
I'm not sure how many new ways
I can find of saying this.

732
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:54,111
I will not be of any use
to Daenerys Targaryen

733
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:56,030
if I lose my mind.

734
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,450
I can't remember
the last face I saw
that wasn't yours.

735
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,202
It's a perfectly
good face.

736
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,037
I am losing my mind.

737
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,372
If anyone recognizes you,
you'll lose more than that.

738
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:08,375
Look, we are thousands
of miles from Westeros.

739
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:13,464
What am I?

740
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,299
One more drunk dwarf.

741
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,717
( knocks )

742
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:19,136
- Driver:<i> Whoa!</i>
-<i> ( horses neigh )</i>

743
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,848
( seagull screeching )

744
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,037
( people shouting )

745
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,372
Woman:
<i>We have to go now.</i>

746
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,374
<i>Come on, hold it.</i>
<i>Hold it.</i>

747
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:49,917
<i>Are you ready?</i>

748
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,462
Slaves.

749
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:57,424
Yes, the Volantene masters
are very organized.

750
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:01,053
<i>Flies for dung shovelers.</i>

751
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,430
<i>Hammers for builders.</i>

752
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,891
<i>Tears for whores.</i>

753
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:07,935
Lest they forget.

754
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,312
<i>( woman speaking Valyrian )</i>

755

( crowd repeating )

756
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:23,450
We should keep moving.

757
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:28,873
( crowd repeating )

758
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,801
The only red priest
we had in King's Landing

759
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,803
was Thoros of Myr.

760
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:44,430
This one's
much better-looking.

761
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,689
Stone Men.

762
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:57,067
Good luck stopping
the spread of greyscale
with prayer.

763
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:59,904
You'd have better luck
dancing away the plague.

764
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:01,155
Shh.

765
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,832
We're going to meet
the savior.

766
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,334
You should have told me.

767
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:16,086
<i>Who doesn't want</i>
<i>to meet the savior?</i>

768
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:33,520
Come on.

769
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,397
Let's find a brothel.

770
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:41,946
- ( people shouting )

Man:
<i>Build your house in a day.</i>

772
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:59,046
( speaking Valyrian )

773
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:02,383
It's even better luck
to suck a dwarf's cock.

774
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:09,640
See?
We blend right in.

775
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:12,977
Just two more travelers
mad with lust.

776
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,108
Thank you.

777
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:20,943
( sniffing )

778
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,160
What curious hair.

779
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:34,081
The Mother of Dragons!

780
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,291
<i>( men laugh )</i>

781

It appears you're not
the only Targaryen supporter.

782
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:40,713
( man laughs )

783

We were just heading
east to see you.

784
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,258
I've got a dragon
for you.

785
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,635
How much to make him
spit fire?

786
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:53,183
Someone who inspires
priests and whores

787
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,727
is worth taking seriously.

788
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,270
What makes you
worth that much?

789
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,814
- I'm magic.
- I'll bet you bloody are.

790
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,775
( laughing )

791
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:04,236
Well, she's taken.

792
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:07,114
Where are you going?

793
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,825
I need to speak
to someone with hair.

794
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,829
- Hello.
- Hello.

795
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,415
- You've got no drink.
- You've got no money.

796
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,834
Do I look like
a man without money?

797
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,129
Never trust looks.

798
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,466
Until quite recently,
I was one of the richest
men in the world.

799
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,259
( laughs )

800
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:30,512
Who needs wealth
when you can make
a woman laugh?

801
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,059
I always pay my debts.

802
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,810
I'm well known for it.

803
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,854
<i>( laughter )</i>

804
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:43,859
You like her.

805
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,652
They all like her.

806
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,112
They all want
to fuck a queen.

807
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:48,989
That's because
they've never met a queen.

808
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:50,407
You're just saying that.

809
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:52,826
You know how
to spot a liar.

810
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,454
If I could pick
any girl here,

811
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:58,040
I would pick you.

812
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,416
Why?

813
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,794
Because you have
a skeptical mind.

814
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,300
All right, then.
I'm warning you,

815
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,928
we're going to have
to wash you first.

816
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,221
Come on.

817
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:22,815
I'm-- I'm sorry,
I can't.

818
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:27,027
Of course you can.
You're shy.

819
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,862
I'm not.

820
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,032
Have another drink.

821
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:34,868
Gladly, but this
I can't do.

822
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:38,038
Believe me, no one
is more shocked
than I am.

823
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:40,707
I hope it passes.

824
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:43,127
What will I do
in my spare time?

825
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:48,841
Go for a piss.
That's a start.

826
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,975
( urinating )

827
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:04,815
<i>( mug splashes )</i>

828
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:09,695
No need to worry.
I was just--

829
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:13,365
Oh, I thought
you were someone else.

830
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:15,742
Show's almost over.

831
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:19,454
I'm sure there
are girls inside
who'd be happy to oblige.

832
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,332
You've made
some kind of mistake.

833
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:25,085
Why don't you tell me
what you think you're
doing and then--

834
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:28,839
I'm taking you
to the queen.

835
