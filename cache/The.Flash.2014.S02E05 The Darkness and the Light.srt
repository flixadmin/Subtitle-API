impossible things:
meta-humans... men and women...

30
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:20,831
with extraordinary abilities:

31

the ability to soar above buildings,

32
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:27,037
to run faster than the speed of light.

33
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:29,473
Unfortunately, most of these meta-humans

34
00:01:29,475 --> 00:01:32,893
have chosen the wrong path
with these powers, a dark path.

Admit it, Wells, and then
maybe you can truly

help me do something about it.

- Hi.

So let me get this straight.

84
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,612
You're the doppelganger
of the man who murdered his mom

85
00:03:48,614 --> 00:03:51,031
and is responsible for both Ronnie

86
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,515
and Eddie's deaths?

87
00:03:52,517 --> 00:03:53,683
Yeah, but he's not even the doppelganger

88
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:55,452
of the Dr. Wells that we knew

89
00:03:55,454 --> 00:03:56,987
because that Dr. Wells' body
had been taken over

90
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:59,373
by the Reverse Flash,
who was really Eobard Thawne

91
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:04,077
and Eddie's distant
relative from the future.

92
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,079
Yeah, I didn't follow
any of that. I'm my own man.

93
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:07,364
I had nothing to do with the murder

94
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:08,698
of your mother or your friend Ricky.

95

- His name was Ronnie.
- Him either.

You told me you have proof of your identity?

This almost hit me
when I went through the portal.

Your stabilized breach
downstairs connects directly

to the S.T.A.R. Labs on my Earth.

Technically, this could be mine,

101
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:23,897
but I want to run some tests on you.

102
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:25,349

The question is why.

I'm guessing you didn't
travel between dimensions

I came here to help you, Barry,

Zoom is obsessed with speed.

135
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:34,652
He will never allow there
to be another speedster

136
00:05:34,654 --> 00:05:36,237
in the multiverse,
and he's gonna keep sending

137
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:38,939
these metas here, one after the next,

138
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:40,408
all with the same goal:

139
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,327
to kill The Flash
unless we stop him together.

00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:50,294
Because I didn't believe her.

164
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:51,628
I didn't even want
to consider Wells was alive.

165
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,298
Eddie erased that Wells from existence.

166
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,735
This guy is... he's someone else,

167
00:06:57,737 --> 00:07:00,071
and he says he's here to help us stop Zoom.

168
00:07:00,073 --> 00:07:01,188
How can you even look at him?

169
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,973
You think this is easy for me?

170
00:07:02,975 --> 00:07:06,277
The guy in there looks, moves,
sounds exactly like the guy

171
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,862
that drove a knife
through my mother's heart.

172
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:10,247
I have to resist the urge to kill him.

173
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:12,700
I'm trying my best to get past that, okay?

174
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:15,119
You shooting him... that's not helping.

175
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:17,321
After all our losses, I thought at least

176
00:07:17,323 --> 00:07:19,323
we were free of Wells.

177
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:22,009
I just want one week
where we're not surprised

178
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:23,761
by somebody from our past.

179
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:26,597
I better go fill in Iris.

180
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,499
Good luck.

181
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:34,638
I hope you're happy, Linda.

182
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,223
Tanner's lawyers are threatening to sue us.

183
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:37,674
I'm sorry, Chief.

184
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:39,477
I don't care how many
touchdowns Tanner throws.

185
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,813
I'm not interviewing some
roided out jerk who hit his wife

186
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:43,847
unless it's to hold him accountable

187
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:46,283
for domestic violence.

188
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:48,068
All right, run your story, Park.

189
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,238
The sports page used to be
a lot less complicated.

190
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,124
She shoots.

191
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:57,411
[imitates swish] She scores.

192
00:07:57,413 --> 00:07:58,829
It's just, every once in a while,

193
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:00,361
you have to remind him
it's the 21st century.

194
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:02,562
[both laugh]

195
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:10,904
But that's not really him,

196
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:13,240
the Wells who Eddie gave his life to stop?

197
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,626
Apparently not.

198
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,445
[sighs]

199
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:20,747
That's life in Central City
these days, right?

200
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:23,717
- You sure?
- Dad, I'm fine, really.

201
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:26,186
Good.

202
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:27,354
I want to keep you that way.

203
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:29,556
- Dad.
- Take it.

204
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:31,275
I taught you how to use it for a reason.

205
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,143
And I'm praying that Barry's right

206
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,561
and this Wells means us no harm.

207
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:36,096
Last year, you had Eddie
to look out for you,

208
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:40,600
but now, you can't murder somebody

209
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:44,705
that everybody thinks is dead, right?

210
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:46,874
Put it away.

211
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:52,046
You do realize that when I said

212
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:54,214
I wanted a drink, I didn't
mean a latte, right?

213
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:55,615
I was talking about alcohol.

214
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:57,334
Like, mind-numbing alcohol.

215
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,803
All right, look, you got give
him a chance, okay?

216
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,555
He's not a speedster.

217
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:05,959
He's just a regular, normal guy
from another universe.

218
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:08,679
I never thought I'd miss time travel.

219
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:09,897
Time travel, huh?

220
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,849
- Hey! Are you kidding?
- Hi!

221
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,768
[laughs] Is there a meta-human
who can time travel?

222
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,904
Time... no. Time travel's not real.

223
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:18,188
'Cause that would be pretty cool!

224
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,524
Not so sure about that.

225
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,826
Patty, you know Cisco Ramon, right?

226
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,978
Yeah, you're the scientific
advisor on meta-humans

227
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,246
to the CCPD, right?

228
00:09:26,248 --> 00:09:27,948
- Yeah, that's me.
- Nice.

229
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,950
Hey, Barr, did you hear
I was right about King Shark?

230
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:32,369
King Shark? Nice name. I like her.

231
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,004
Yeah, yeah, King Shark almost ate The Flash.

232
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,873
Oh, nah, I'm sure The Flash had it handled.

233
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,824
Oh, no, I was there. I saw it all.

234
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:39,593
Some hooded guy saved his life.

235
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:41,712
Wait, and you're not,
like, traumatized or anything?

236
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:44,047
I just watched a half man-half shark

237
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:45,849
take on the fastest man alive.

238
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,385
[laughs] I love this city.

239
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:51,171
- [phone vibrates]
- See... sorry.

240
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,890
Oh, uh, Captain just texted me.

241
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:56,276
He wants me to write my police report.

242
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:58,228
Uh, you maybe want to write it with me?

243
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,348
Uh, I can't tonight.
I'm busy. Um, yeah, sorry.

244
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,649
Oh, yeah, okay.

245
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:04,451
I've just got science stuff.

246
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:07,354
Stuff I gotta science the stuff out of.

247
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,956
Maybe next time.

248
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,326
- Yeah! Coolio.
- Yeah.

249
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:14,294
But I'm gonna actually skip the coffee

250
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:15,879
and go get a head start, so...

251
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,498
- Oh.
- Good to see you guys.

252
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,883
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

253
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,502
- For real?
- Stop, all right?

254
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:23,804
I was gonna ask her out,
and then a man-shark

255
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:25,539
tried to eat me, and then
Dr. Wells the sequel showed up.

256
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,224
Okay, can we not use the name "Dr. Wells"?

257
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,842
I'm just gonna call him "Harry."

258
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:30,394
Okay. Harry, yeah.

259
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,212
Listen, there's always
gonna be Harrys out there,

260
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,764
but you can't let the Harrys of the world

261
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,649
get in the way of you living your life.

262
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:37,100
Ask Patty out.

263
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:38,936
You gotta... you gotta be bold.

264
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,487
That's tough talk.

265
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:44,858
When was the last time
you asked a girl for her number?

266
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,493
Watch and learn.

267
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:48,728
I'm watching.

268
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,448
Hi. What can I get you?

269
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,868
- Hi, there.
- Hi... again.

270
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,070
Uh...

271
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:00,907
Do you want some coffee?

272
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:02,125
Yeah, I'll get some coffee.

273
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,211
No, uh, no, I don't want coffee.

274
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:05,679
You know what I do want though?

275
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:07,181
I want to ask you this.

276
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:10,083
Do you want to go out with me?

277
00:11:12,437 --> 00:11:13,937
Oh.

278
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:17,424
To... we... I mean, we could
go get coffee or we...

279
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:21,061
No.

280
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:23,096
That's a no.

281
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:26,033
That's totally cool. It's cool.

282
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:27,401

Hey, what's up?

We have another breacher.

What? How do you know?

Her name is Doctor Light. [exhales]

Small-time thief on my Earth until exposure

299
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:40,855
to the dark matter
from the Particle Accelerator

300
00:12:40,857 --> 00:12:42,806
and became a meta-human with the ability

301
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:44,992
to derive power from starlight.

302
00:12:44,994 --> 00:12:46,527
Oh, very cool.

of 5,300 degree kelvin

304

305
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,223
"Not very cool at all."

306
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:54,024
You know, our Dr. Wells may have been evil,

307
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:55,576
but you're just a dick.

308
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:58,529
Okay, so obviously, Zoom brought her here

309
00:12:58,531 --> 00:13:00,164
from your Earth like the others.

310
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,216
Mm-hmm. Now that we know that,

311
00:13:02,218 --> 00:13:03,801
we can use that to gain advantage.

312
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:05,419
What do you mean?

313
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:10,141
We capture Doctor Light
and use her to lure Zoom here.

314
00:13:10,143 --> 00:13:11,709
You are insane!

315
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:13,877
Okay, we are not luring Zoom anywhere!

316
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,146
Apparently, they know each other,

317
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:16,597
and Jay is not a fan.

318
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:17,648
Huh.

00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,150
Well, well, well.

Like everyone else, I assumed
Earth-2 Flash was dead.

321

Why am I not surprised
to find Jay Garrick here,

322
00:13:24,056 --> 00:13:28,192
still alive and in hiding
a full universe away from Zoom?

I'm not in hiding.

00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:32,580
Zoom nearly killed me and stole my speed

325
00:13:32,582 --> 00:13:34,281
before the Singularity pulled me here.

326
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:35,783
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

327
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:38,202
Well, whatever the case, in your absence,

328
00:13:38,204 --> 00:13:41,789
Zoom has only gotten more powerful, faster.

329
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,759
Barry, you have to defeat Zoom
now while you still can.

330
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:46,577
No, this isn't the time to be reckless.

331
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:48,429
We don't even know
why Zoom sent Doctor Light here.

332
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:50,181
She's a thief, not a killer.

333
00:13:50,183 --> 00:13:51,932
Zoom can make people
do things out of character.

334
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:53,718
Thief or not, she'll kill you.

335
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,136
All right, look, hey,

336
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:57,271
we can decide what to do with Light later.

337
00:13:57,273 --> 00:13:59,857
First, we have to find her, okay?

that she was breaking into the bank?

341
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:11,101
I got an alert on my phone.

342
00:14:11,103 --> 00:14:13,103
There is a little

a robbery at a bank.

344
00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:15,956
- What?
- But you know what?

345
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,875
I think I can get the
S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

346
00:14:17,877 --> 00:14:20,244
to scan for any irregular
solar radiation emissions

347
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:23,581
and we can find Doctor Light's light.

348
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:27,918
Okay, I'm gonna also call Joe,
see if CCPD has any leads.

349
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,755
Why don't we keep them apart
until I get back?

350
00:14:30,757 --> 00:14:33,390
I am sure that won't be a problem.

How's your science stuff?

00:14:47,273 --> 00:14:48,472
I finished it.

Um, did you get your report done?

358
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:51,609
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

359
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:55,079
It wasn't as much fun
writing it by myself, but...

Yeah.

Hey, do you ever feel completely overwhelmed

363
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:03,821
by everything that you have to do in a day

364
00:15:03,823 --> 00:15:05,456
and it feels like the one thing

365
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,459
that you actually want to do
is the thing that gets lost?

366
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:10,127
I'm confused. What?

367
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:13,764
I've been thinking, for
a while now actually,

368
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:15,549
would you want to get dinner
with me sometime?

369
00:15:15,551 --> 00:15:18,018
Yeah, this isn't gonna be one those things

370
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,688
where I get really excited
and then, you know,

371
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,189
more science stuff comes up, right?

372
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:25,309
No, no, that's not... um, tomorrow?

373
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:26,811
We can grab an early dinner.

374
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:29,396
I don't want to wait anymore.

375

Okay. Looking forward to it.

I see he made almost the same mistake I did

with the Particle Accelerator.

391
00:16:11,223 --> 00:16:12,823
He did a lot of terrible things,

392
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:15,159
and none of them were by mistake.

393

What did he do to you?

394
00:16:18,197 --> 00:16:19,780
I know he caused the Singularity,

395
00:16:19,782 --> 00:16:21,866
murdered Barry's mother,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

396

What did he do to you?

397
00:16:23,336 --> 00:16:25,336
You can barely look me in the eye.

398
00:16:25,338 --> 00:16:27,121
Why is that? What did he do to you?

399
00:16:27,123 --> 00:16:30,374
He shoved his hand through my chest.

400
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:31,542
He stopped my heart.

but you survived that.

404
00:16:38,851 --> 00:16:42,419
Only because Barry erased that timeline.

405
00:16:42,421 --> 00:16:44,755
I see. Barry traveled in time.

406
00:16:44,757 --> 00:16:49,193
- Twice.
- Hmm.

407
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:51,445
- Here's how it is.
- What's the deal?

408
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:53,063
You don't have to like me.

409
00:16:53,065 --> 00:16:54,732
I don't like you,

410
00:16:54,734 --> 00:16:58,068
but you have to work with me
to stop Zoom and Doctor Light.

411
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,788
Can you do that?

412
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,105
I guess we'll see, won't we?

413
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:04,041
I guess we will.

One more thing...

415
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:07,444
you said you were going to re-task

00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:09,246
the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite?

yeah, we're up and running.

Don't worry. It'll work.

How long is this gonna last?

449
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:41,047
You're suffering from solar retinopathy.

450
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:43,116
Your retinas are severely damaged.

451
00:18:43,118 --> 00:18:44,668
You're lucky you're not permanently blind.

452
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,670
But with your rapid regeneration abilities,

453
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:47,921
your sight should return soon.

454
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:50,149
6.25 hours by my estimation.

455
00:18:50,235 --> 00:18:52,068
All this could have been avoided
if you just stopped Light

456
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,636
instead of chitchatting with her.

457
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:55,137
She caught Barry off guard.

458
00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:57,073
Always an excuse with you, right?

459
00:18:57,075 --> 00:18:59,108
He's the fastest man alive.
How could she possibly do that?

460
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,444
Because Light looks exactly
like my ex-girlfriend,

461
00:19:01,446 --> 00:19:03,446
Linda Park.

462
00:19:03,448 --> 00:19:06,082
That's why Zoom sent her...
because he knew you'd hesitate.

463
00:19:06,084 --> 00:19:07,917
That means Zoom had to have known somehow

464
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,535
that Linda was your ex.

465
00:19:09,537 --> 00:19:11,504
Which is why Barry has to act now,

466
00:19:11,506 --> 00:19:13,840
before Zoom sends another double
from Barry's life.

467
00:19:13,842 --> 00:19:15,625
All right, right now,
I'm more worried about Linda.

468
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:18,928
When I saw who was
under the mask, I said her name.

469
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,663
What if Light didn't even
realize that she had

470
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:22,515
a doppelganger here
until I accidentally told her?

471
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:24,333
The first thing that Atom Smasher did

472
00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:26,636
when he crossed the breach
was to kill his doppelganger.

473
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:28,471
Yeah, but Light's not like Atom Smasher.

474
00:19:28,473 --> 00:19:30,173
We should keep an eye on your Linda.

00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:50,284
You look just like him.

485
00:19:50,286 --> 00:19:51,919
I'm guessing my counterpart
did something to offend her

486
00:19:51,921 --> 00:19:53,087
as well?

487
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:55,122
Her fiancé died because of him.

488
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:57,124
Oh.

489
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,881
Iris, I know it's weird seeing him.

490
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:05,933
Yeah, it's just a lot to process lately.

491
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:08,269
Wells, my mother.

492
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:10,837
How are you doing with that, by the way?

493
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:14,174
I mean, now that she's gone,

494
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:16,193
okay.

495
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:18,062
Yeah, Iris, um, look...

496
00:20:18,064 --> 00:20:19,230
Yeah. [giggles]

497
00:20:19,232 --> 00:20:20,531
Thanks.

498
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,516
You know you can talk to me about it.

499
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:25,536
Yeah, I know, but really, I'm fine, okay?

500
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:27,288
I should be asking how you're doing.

501
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,874
- [phone vibrating]
- That's me. I got it.

502
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:31,709
- Barry, let me help you.
- I got it.

503
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:33,878
- All right.
- [laughs]

504
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,697
Uh, "Running a little late. P."

505
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:37,631
Who's P?

506
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:39,866
[sighs] P.

507
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:41,802
- That's Patty.
- My dad's partner Patty?

508
00:20:41,804 --> 00:20:43,036
Mm-hmm.

509
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:44,305
What is she running late for?

510
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:47,424
Um, our first date.

511
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:50,311
That's so great! She's great.

512
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:52,513
Yeah, no, Patty's great. I just, you know...

513
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:54,181
I doubt she's gonna give me another shot

514
00:20:54,183 --> 00:20:55,382
when I have to cancel on her.

515
00:20:55,384 --> 00:20:56,901
Don't cancel.

516
00:20:56,903 --> 00:20:59,486
I'm blind, Iris. A literal blind date.

517
00:20:59,488 --> 00:21:00,554
It's not gonna work.

518
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:02,055
Hey, we are in S.T.A.R. Labs.

519
00:21:02,057 --> 00:21:03,440
Come on, there's gotta be something here

520
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:05,075
that can help you get through the night.

521
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:07,227
Yeah.

522
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:09,997
Or someone.

523
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:14,868
Cisco, hey!

524
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:18,071
- To your left. Other left.
- Cisco.

525
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,677
[jazz music playing]

526
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,346
Sorry.

527
00:21:27,915 --> 00:21:29,916
Ooh, sorry.

528
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:33,804
Okay. She's two steps in front of you.

529
00:21:33,806 --> 00:21:36,590
- Nice glasses.
- Hey, hey!

530
00:21:36,592 --> 00:21:38,592
- Touchdown.
- I'm so sorry I'm late.

531
00:21:38,594 --> 00:21:40,144
No, don't be.

532
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:41,729
You know, I actually judge
my dates on whether or not

533
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:44,148
they stand me up,
so you are off to a great start.

534
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,866
What do you mean? Who would stand you up?

535
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:47,618
Oh, I have a reputation.

536
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,705
Not that kind of reputation.
That's not what I meant.

537
00:21:51,707 --> 00:21:53,707
[laughs] That's embarrassing.

538
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:56,043
You know, I actually...
I arrested a boyfriend once.

539
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:57,411
Oh.

540
00:21:57,413 --> 00:21:59,413
A very ex-boyfriend,
while we were at dinner.

541
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:02,416
He got really wasted and decided
to insult the waitress,

542
00:22:02,418 --> 00:22:04,551
so I cited him for public intoxication.

543
00:22:04,553 --> 00:22:06,754
- That is hilarious.
- Yeah.

544
00:22:06,756 --> 00:22:09,757
[both laugh] Special.

545
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,976
So...

546
00:22:11,978 --> 00:22:13,477
<i>Dude, she looks amazing.</i>

547
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:15,312
<i>You have to tell her how amazing she looks.</i>

548
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:17,431
You look amazing, Patty.

549
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:20,401
Uh, thanks, I actually
had a really hard time

550
00:22:20,403 --> 00:22:22,186
trying to figure out what to wear, like,

551
00:22:22,188 --> 00:22:25,072
if I should wear a dress or if
this color was a little weird.

552
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:26,640
No, you look great.

553
00:22:26,642 --> 00:22:30,744
Um, yeah, no, that...
what would you call that color?

554
00:22:30,746 --> 00:22:32,946
<i>- Um, uh...</i>
- I can't tell.

555
00:22:32,948 --> 00:22:34,531
The feed's black and white. <i>I don't know.</i>

556
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:36,834
Yeah, whatever it is,
that color should thank you

557
00:22:36,836 --> 00:22:38,202
for wearing it.

558
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:40,004
[laughs] My man.

559
00:22:40,006 --> 00:22:42,790
- Smooth.
- Not smooth.

560
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:44,625
[both giggle]

561
00:22:44,627 --> 00:22:46,827
Oh, wine list. Here we go.

562
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:51,098
Uh, yes, uh, got it. Thank you.

563
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,433
Um...

564
00:22:52,435 --> 00:22:54,852
Um, you know, why don't you... Oop!

565
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:56,437
- Sorry.
- No, that's okay.

566
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:58,272
The guy always picks. Why don't you choose?

567
00:22:58,274 --> 00:23:02,342
Yeah, what do you want, red or white?

568
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:04,445
Whatever you'd like. Uh, yeah.

569
00:23:04,447 --> 00:23:06,847
You got this. Why do you even need me?

570
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:16,356
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

571
00:23:16,358 --> 00:23:17,458
Classic stakeout fuel.

572
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,792
Yeah.

573
00:23:18,794 --> 00:23:20,694
You have coffee on your Earth, right?

574
00:23:20,696 --> 00:23:23,080
I think coffee's the one
constant in the multiverse.

575
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:24,798
[both laugh]

576
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,086
So I don't mean to pry,
but when Wells keeps referring

577
00:23:29,088 --> 00:23:31,872
to you and Zoom, what's he talking about?

578
00:23:31,874 --> 00:23:33,707
I fought Zoom many times,

579
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:35,976
each time barely escaping with my life.

580
00:23:37,762 --> 00:23:39,763
[sighs] So yeah.

581
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:41,815
Maybe I didn't always
confront him when I should have.

582
00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:43,350
Truth is, Zoom scared me.

583
00:23:43,352 --> 00:23:47,521
He stole the most precious thing
from me: my speed.

584
00:23:47,523 --> 00:23:49,556
I didn't want Barry to suffer the same fate.

585
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:51,992
Well, maybe if you just sat down with Wells,

586
00:23:51,994 --> 00:23:53,494
talked to him about it...

587
00:23:53,496 --> 00:23:55,496
No, no, no. Do not trust Wells, Caitlin.

588
00:23:55,498 --> 00:23:57,063
The guy was more than happy to make money

589
00:23:57,065 --> 00:23:58,916
off the meta-human problem
with his tech apps,

590
00:23:58,918 --> 00:24:00,834
and now he's obsessed with Zoom.

591
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:04,171
Something has changed and not
just because I disappeared.

592
00:24:06,257 --> 00:24:09,760
Well, I don't trust Wells. I trust you.

593
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:12,679
[laughs]

594
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:14,715
[giggles]

595
00:24:14,717 --> 00:24:16,016
So I've actually been dying to ask you,

596
00:24:16,018 --> 00:24:17,351
what was it like to be struck by lightning?

597
00:24:17,353 --> 00:24:20,921
Mm. Life-changing, to be honest.

598
00:24:20,923 --> 00:24:22,523
Did it hurt?

599
00:24:22,525 --> 00:24:25,109
I mean, all I really remember
is feeling electricity

600
00:24:25,111 --> 00:24:26,527
surging through my body.

601
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:28,595
<i>It was an intensity I had never felt,</i>

602
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:33,200
<i>like I was instantly connected</i>
<i>to everything around me.</i>

603
00:24:33,202 --> 00:24:35,369
<i>Then I woke up from a coma
nine months later.</i>

604
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:37,103
<i>Waking up in the future</i> <i>like that,</i>

605
00:24:37,105 --> 00:24:39,940
<i>it's like time travel.</i>

606
00:24:39,942 --> 00:24:41,241
[all chuckle]

607
00:24:41,243 --> 00:24:42,826
<i>- Sort of, yeah.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

608
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:46,463
When I was nine, I actually drowned.

609
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:48,081
I hit my head on the diving board

610
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,750
and fell into the swimming pool.

611
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:52,786
Uh, my heart stopped for,
I think, two minutes

612
00:24:52,788 --> 00:24:55,556
until my dad rescued me and saved my life.

613
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:56,924
Yeah.

614
00:24:56,926 --> 00:24:59,927
So I guess we've both cheated death.

615
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:01,478
[both laugh]

616
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,313
I've been through a few things in my life

617
00:25:03,315 --> 00:25:05,482
that taught me not to be afraid of anything.

618
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:07,133
I think fear is what holds people back

619
00:25:07,135 --> 00:25:09,186
from being who they should be.

620
00:25:09,188 --> 00:25:11,488
Ugh, preach!

621
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,273
[clears throat]

622
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:14,474
Yeah, I'm still here, creepin' and peepin'.

623
00:25:14,476 --> 00:25:15,943
You okay?

624
00:25:15,945 --> 00:25:19,696
Sorry, I just...
Yeah, I really agree with that.

625
00:25:19,698 --> 00:25:21,582
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

626
00:25:21,584 --> 00:25:27,037
I think another thing, too,
I think you can't see me.

627
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,756
- Abort!
- What? What do you mean?

628
00:25:29,758 --> 00:25:31,592
I think you can't see me.

629
00:25:31,594 --> 00:25:33,177
Come on, I would not be a good detective

630
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:34,678
if I couldn't have figured this one out.

631
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,631
[both laugh] I don't know.

632
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:40,517
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah.

633
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:44,004
I'm really sorry and embarrassed

634
00:25:44,006 --> 00:25:45,389
<i>I didn't say anything.</i>

635
00:25:45,391 --> 00:25:48,508
- I had my pupils dilated earlier.
- Barry.

636
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,194
Oh, my God! Barry!

637
00:25:50,196 --> 00:25:52,646
And I really didn't want to cancel.

638
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:56,650
- [both laugh]
- <i>Barry! I lost my eyes!</i>

639
00:25:56,652 --> 00:26:00,020
No, you have a great smile.

640
00:26:00,022 --> 00:26:02,656
Really, how do you know I'm smiling?

641
00:26:02,658 --> 00:26:03,790
Just a hunch.

642
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:07,127
[laughs]

643
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:09,663
Okay, so what else
is different about our worlds?

644
00:26:09,665 --> 00:26:11,548

Never been, but I do love Atlantis.

As in the lost city submerged
in the ocean somewhere?

Well, it's actually above water on my Earth.

Ah.

I thought we could reason with her.

You cannot reason with someone

He doubts himself because of you,

but believe me,
Barry can do what you could not.

Barry can stop Zoom.

Wrong! Zoom hunted you!

735
00:30:40,987 --> 00:30:42,954
You spent the last two years of your life

running, running, running from Zoom.

737

Zoom would have killed me

No, because he is not like you.

740
00:30:51,214 --> 00:30:53,714
Barry runs towards danger, not from it,

741

I've seen what you can do, Barry.

748

I've calculated how fast you can run,

749
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:26,581
and you should be teaching Jay,
not the other way around.

750
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:33,621
You know, before I learned
that the other Wells

751
00:31:33,623 --> 00:31:37,542
was the man who murdered my mom,
I looked up to him.

752
00:31:37,544 --> 00:31:39,710
He was my mentor, actually.

753
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:47,018
So my doppelganger,

754
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,420
a man who looks exactly like me,

755
00:31:49,422 --> 00:31:51,389
betrayed you.

Mm.

I'm sorry, I'm not him,

00:31:57,864 --> 00:32:01,983
take care of Zoom, and all we have to do

[snaps fingers] is capture Doctor Light.

761
00:32:03,786 --> 00:32:07,605
I thought about testing
the mask for Light's DNA,

762
00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:09,106
but it would only have Linda's.

763
00:32:09,108 --> 00:32:12,209
The mask, what mask?

764
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:13,744
Light's mask.

765
00:32:16,214 --> 00:32:17,832
How did you get this?

766
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:19,884
Iris shot it off Doctor Light
when she attacked Linda.

767
00:32:19,886 --> 00:32:21,836
You know how to use the mask to find Light?

768
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:23,120
Yes, I do.

769
00:32:23,122 --> 00:32:25,789
All we have to do is give it to him.

Cisco, have you known about this,

782
00:33:08,034 --> 00:33:09,300
and you didn't say anything to us?

783
00:33:09,302 --> 00:33:11,268
Yeah, I was gonna tell you.

784
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,436
Thanks a lot, Harry.

I swear I was, but I didn't.

786
00:33:17,276 --> 00:33:20,778
- I was just... I was afraid.
- Afraid of what?

787
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,949
Dr. Wells said the dark matter
gave me this, this gift.

788
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:29,954
He said that one day I'd thank him for it.

789
00:33:29,956 --> 00:33:31,739
What if I become like him?

790
00:33:31,741 --> 00:33:35,326
Cisco, I don't think
any of us would become evil

791
00:33:35,328 --> 00:33:36,660
if we all of sudden got powers,

792
00:33:36,662 --> 00:33:38,212
even if they were from Dr. Wells.

793
00:33:38,214 --> 00:33:42,499
Yeah, maybe you're right.

794
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:44,551
I should have said something.

795
00:33:44,553 --> 00:33:46,387
That's my fault. I'm sorry.

796
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:47,805
Well, you can be sorry later,

797
00:33:47,807 --> 00:33:49,390
because right now, we
have to use your powers

798
00:33:49,392 --> 00:33:50,841
to find Doctor Light.

799
00:33:50,843 --> 00:33:54,211
Cisco, your abilities, how do they work?

800
00:33:54,213 --> 00:33:56,730
Uh, I get these feelings sometimes,

801

Sometimes it just happens.

Sometimes it's when I'm touching
something of theirs.

You need to confuse her.

Give her more than one target,

Yeah, well, when you factor in
the size of the city,
