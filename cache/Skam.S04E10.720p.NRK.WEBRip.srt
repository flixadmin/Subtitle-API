1
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:20,084
..

2
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:28,062
[I’m finished and right by your place, 
should I drop by so I can buy you some beer?]


3
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:34,093
[Just wait downstairs and I’ll be right there]


4
00:01:00,044 --> 00:01:03,044
..

5
00:01:26,072 --> 00:01:29,072
..

6
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:41,016
..

7
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:45,053
- Hi.
- Hi!


8
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:49,007
 My name is Håkon and I’m the
new chairman of the apartment complex.

9
00:01:49,092 --> 00:01:53,016
- Hi!
- Is your mom home?

10
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:57,068
No, unfortunately, she’s not.
Can I help you with something?

11
00:01:57,076 --> 00:02:03,036
Yes, I’m just saying hi
to the neighbors and ...

12
00:02:03,044 --> 00:02:08,060
Your mom hasn’t paid the fees ...

13
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:12,032
- Oh!
- So I was just wondering if she has been notified?

14
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,097
- She probably just forgot!
She works a lot, but I’ll tell her.


15
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:18,053
- Yes. You can?
- Yes!

16
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:20,069
That’s it. Bye.

17
00:02:21,036 --> 00:02:24,004
Bye!

18
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:17,072


19
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:50,060
[SANA: Dear Vilde. I don’t think I’ve 
told you, but I just wanted to say
 that I admire you so much for
 being so strong. No matter what
 happens, you never give up,
 you keep on going. You’re 
the first person I would bring with me to 
war, and I love you so much.
 I’m inviting you to an
 Eid party at my place on Saturday. Eid is
 a holiday that marks the end of Ramadan.
 Saturday is the last day of Ramadan 
and I’d like to break the fast with all the
 people I love. Lots of food, 
a chill atmosphere and only
 good people. I’ll be 
so happy if you come. Sana]


20
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,024
Mom?

21
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,020
- Mamma? I'm going out.
- Mm ...

22
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:59,004
Who rang the doorbell?

23
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:03,037
It was someone collecting signatures.


24
00:05:03,077 --> 00:05:07,021
Oh, ok then.

25
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:42,000
- Sorry, I lost track of time!
- No worries.

26
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,096
My mom and I got carried away chatting.

27
00:05:46,004 --> 00:05:49,004
- Should we get outta here?
- Yes!

28
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,040
Hurry!

29
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:33,028
Hey.

30
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:36,036
Hey.

31
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,040
- Did you sleep well?
- Mhm.

32
00:06:55,072 --> 00:07:02,024
- I just dreamt something fucked up.
- Yeah, what?

33
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,060
I dreamt that I was at
my old elementary school.

34
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:14,020
And ...
we were eating lunch outside.

35
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:19,092
Me and Caroline,
who was my girlfriend in fourth grade.

36
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,096
and then you were walking past
and I was like “Wow, damn”!

37
00:07:27,004 --> 00:07:31,064
And then I walked up to you and was like ...

38
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:37,012
“Hey, do you wanna date me?”
in front of Caroline.

39
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,074
What did I say?


40
00:07:39,073 --> 00:07:41,040
You said yes, of course.

41
00:07:42,056 --> 00:07:45,072
Yeah?

42
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,068
Of course.

43
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:50,088
Okay, well ...

44
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:54,096
I guess that means your dreams aren’t real.

45
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,040
And that’s supposed to mean ...?

46
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:05,076
That we’re never going to be together.

47
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:12,000
- Why not?
- Why?

48
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,020
- Because ...
- Because?

49
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:23,076
- You are ...
- I am? What am I?

50
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:28,064
- A cheating fuckboy.
- Ouch.

51
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,080


52
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,064
- Hi, Vilde.
- Hi, what are you doing?

53
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:51,064
Nothing in particular ...

54
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:58,000
Listen, I wanted to do something nice for
Sana at that Eid-celebration, to show her how much we love her.

55
00:08:58,008 --> 00:09:00,020
Yeah, we can do that.

56
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:03,076
So I’ve read a bit about Eid and
it’s common to give gifts.

57
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:09,000
But it’s often just to kids and money and stuff,
and it’d be a bit weird to give her money.

58
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:13,048
I wanna give her something really special,
so do you have any ideas?

59
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:16,056
Uhm ...

60
00:09:17,064 --> 00:09:21,052
No, I don’t know.

61
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:28,000
But we should probably ask someone for some advice,
maybe someone who knows more than us.

62
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:31,028
Yeah, I agree. We’ll ask a Muslim.

63
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:33,076
Yes.

64
00:09:33,084 --> 00:09:38,052
Hey, but listen, maybe I’ll
call you up a bit later or something?

65
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,048
- Okay.
- Okay, good bye.

66
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:47,008
Where were we?

67
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:51,072
We were talking about whether we should get together.

68
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,052
- I don’t think so.
- I think that was it.

69
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,025
- You don’t? Because I think you may want to.
- No.

70
00:09:58,053 --> 00:09:59,001
You sure?

71
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:02,020
- Yes, I’m sure.
- Totally sure?

72
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:05,004
Yes, very.

73
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,020
Eva?

74
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:14,016
- Hide!
- Why?

75
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:16,016
Oh, I’m sorry!

76
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,064
Uhm ... I have a guest.

77
00:10:21,072 --> 00:10:24,036
Yeah.

78
00:10:26,032 --> 00:10:28,076
- This is ...
- Hey!

79
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:31,032
- Chris.
- Hi.

80
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,032
Chris.

81
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,008
Is your name Chris too?

82
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:40,032
Yeah, no, my name is Anne Marit.

83
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Oh, okay. That makes sense.

84
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:45,048
- Yeah ...
- Yeah.

85
00:10:45,056 --> 00:10:50,076
I’m sorry for just..
I didn’t know Eva had a boyfriend.

86
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:53,064
We’re not together.

87
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:58,012
Yet.

88
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,072
Yes.

89
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:07,044
But that’s...
I’m sure you’ll figure that out. Okay!

90
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,021
Why did you stand up?


91
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:18,045
I had to introduce myself! I was raised well.


92
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:19,097
You have to say hi to people

93
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,020
You could’ve introduce yourself another time!

94
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,020
No. Love me.

95
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:28,052
One time, he forgot to bring his bike so I had to ...


96
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:31,097
I had to take ...

97
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:32,097
You had to take his bike?

98
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:51,036
- But I’ll text you.
- Yeah, talk later.

99
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,025
Where are you going?

100
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:54,037
- The A building.
- Okay.

101
00:11:55,052 --> 00:11:59,008
- And you?
- I’m going to the B building.

102
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:03,048
- Yes ...
- Yes ...

103
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:08,016
- What is it?
- Nothing, is there something?

104
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:13,029
You go first, because you’re so embarrassed of me.


105
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:15,037
I’m not embarrassed of you!


106
00:12:15,037 --> 00:12:16,061
You’re embarrassed of me ...

107
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:21,080
No ...
It’s just ... People...

108
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:29,020
- You’re embarrassed of me.
- No, I’m not!

109
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:44,020
I have like this bad feeling.
I have this nervous, sinking feeling ...

110
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:46,040
- Hey!
- Why?

111
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:51,028
- Because girls are good at side eyeing.
- You’re the best, so you’ll win over everyone!

112
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:55,008
But think about it, if I’m invited
so they can like fuck with me or something.

113
00:12:55,016 --> 00:12:58,071
That won’t happen. She just wants peace, right? It’s like this ...

114
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:03,049
Declaration of peace to invite someone to their Eid celebration.

115
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:09,092
Exactly what is an Eid party?
What do you do? Is there any alcohol?

116
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,092
- You can manage one party without alcohol?
- Yes, I was just asking!

117
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,065
Yeah, sorry, but I don’t think there’s going to be any alcohol.


118
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:20,061
But I’ll be there anyway.

119
00:13:20,088 --> 00:13:22,072
See you there!

120
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,045
Hey, boys.

121
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:24,002
Where have you been?

122
00:13:24,031 --> 00:13:25,033
Where the fuck have you been?

123
00:13:25,044 --> 00:13:27,017
I went to McDonald’s.


124
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:28,049
McDonalds?


125
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:29,081
Did you sit by yourself at McDonald’s?

126
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:31,093
- No ... Yes ...
- Alone.

127
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:33,077
Is that so fucking ...

128
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:39,020
Imagine, him sitting by himself,
eating a burger at McDonalds.

129
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:42,000
What the fuck is up with you? It’s McDonald’s.

130
00:13:42,008 --> 00:13:44,013
- Where did you get money?
- Yeah, I was also wondering about that.


131
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:46,045
- I borrowed money.
- From who?

132
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:50,044
- Julian Dahl.
- The ATM.

133
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:52,071
I don’t get why you dislike Julian Dahl. He’s rich!


134
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:55,042
It’s always about money! He doesn’t even know
Jonas and he can just ask?

135
00:13:56,044 --> 00:14:00,060
I saw him go to school in a suit one time, that’s a bit weird.

136
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:03,048
- Fucking Julian Dahl.
- Julian fucking Dahl.

137
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:10,047
[Hey, this is maybe a bit far out, 
but you dated Eva once. I’m crushing
 a bit on her, but I don’t really get her, 
from one bro to another, do you have
 any advice? Like what kind of flowers 
does she like hahaha]

138
00:14:03,056 --> 00:14:07,036
- The fuck?!
- What’s up?

139
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:11,008
Okay, I just got a message.

140
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,020
- From Penetrator-Chris.
- Penetrator-Chris? What does he want?

141
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:18,023
- Listen... “Hey, this is maybe a bit far out”.
- Yeah, I think so too.

142
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:25,000
"But you dated Eva once.
I’m crushing a bit on her."

143
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:28,048
- "But I don’t really get her,
from one bro to another, do you have any advice?"
- Bro?

144
00:14:28,056 --> 00:14:31,021
"Like what kind of flowers does she like hahaha."


145
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:33,020
I love that ending.

146
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,021
- Are you bros?
- Ending the message with “hahaha”.


147
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:36,041
- No. Why should I give him advice?

148
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,068
- Why not?
- It’s Penetrator-Chris!

149
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:44,076
- He’s not good enough for her!
- I think he’s pretty hot, though.

150
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:47,076
- Eva is like up here! And he’s like ...
- Hi!

151
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:55,024
Hey, Mahdi? We’re buying Sana a gift to show her
how much we love her and we don’t really know what.

152
00:14:55,032 --> 00:15:01,004
I was wondering if there are any Muslim traditions
of what to give as a gift on Eid?

153
00:15:01,012 --> 00:15:03,092
Uhm, I’m Catholic.

154
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,036
- Oh, sorry.
- You don’t have to apologize.

155
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:10,020
Who should I ask then?

156
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:13,056
If you wanna tell Sana how much you love her, -

157
00:15:13,064 --> 00:15:17,037
Tell her in a card! Or what, baby?

158
00:15:17,064 --> 00:15:20,080
- Yeah.
- Do that.

159
00:15:24,084 --> 00:15:29,024
Vilde?
What’s up with Chris and Eva?

160
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,068
I don’t know, I think they’re just sleeping together.
Eva is maybe a bit in love with him, but ...

161
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:40,044
I don’t think he’s keen on something more.

162
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:45,028
- Bye!
- Bye. Give me a kiss before you leave.

163
00:15:45,036 --> 00:15:47,088
- Bye. 
 - Bye, baby.

164
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:54,096
But fuck! With Penetrator-Chris.
That was brave of him.

165
00:15:55,004 --> 00:16:01,028
It’s brave to send a text to the ex and ask about flowers.

166
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,085
Yeah, yeah. Do you think it’s like Vilde said
or is he serious or just fucking around?

167
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:08,020
I actually think it was awesome of him to text you.

168
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:13,032
People change and maybe he has changed! People change!

169
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,069
It’s pretty awesome to text the ex and ask about your girl.


170
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:18,053
It was pretty brave and it seems like he’s serious.

171
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:20,057
He was talking about flowers!


172
00:16:21,036 --> 00:16:23,000
Who’s the last person you gave flowers to?

173
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,005
My mom.


174
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:26,032
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

175
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:31,000
You won’t get a lot of flowers from Mahdi, at least.
He’s an alright guy.

176
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:36,000
If Eva likes him, and he likes Eva, just give him some advice.

177
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:41,084
Yeah, but he’s not like he seems. Remember when we
had that beef with Yakuza?

178
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:47,012
All that planning was me and Chris who did and he’s an alright guy.

179
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:52,029
He was the one who wanted to stand up against
the biggest douches in all of Oslo.


180
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:55,033
He had your back?

181
00:16:57,036 --> 00:17:01,080
Anyways, it turned out he was a really nice guy and, -

182
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:23,081
[Fuck flowers, take it down a notch, just 
ask if she wants to watch Fresh Prince and
eat nachos or something.]

183
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:07,028
And we thought ‘fuck it’,
let’s try to take them Yakuza on ...

184
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:09,025
Were you keen on him?


185
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:10,077
- Huh?
- Were you keen on him?

186
00:17:12,022 --> 00:17:13,085
No, no, no, but ...

187
00:17:16,032 --> 00:17:18,028
Was he the one who knocked
that guy down with the bottle?

188
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:20,037
No, that was William.


189
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:22,017
Poor guy.

190
00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:26,024
- What happened to the guy after?
- He deserved it. He’s the worst cunt in all of Oslo.

191
00:17:26,032 --> 00:17:30,028
Did he pass out?

192
00:17:30,036 --> 00:17:35,020
Almost. I was in the middle of the fight ...

193
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:39,016
- Who?
- Did you fight?

194
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:42,078
Yeah, it was this rich preppy guy from Bærum.


195
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:50,017
Who won? Is it fun to have beef?

196
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:59,017
[Hey, sorry for being lame, come 
with me to a party on Saturday?]

197
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:56,036
- They had a plan of beating up everyone in their way, they had to be stopped.
- That’s fucked.

198
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:57,081
It was fucked! They beat up Jonas!


199
00:17:58,061 --> 00:17:59,099
- That’s not cool.
- No! They did?


200
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah, without any reason!

201
00:18:01,088 --> 00:18:06,088
- What’s up with your William hair?
- That’s not William hair.

202
00:18:06,096 --> 00:18:10,020
I’ll show you William hair.

203
00:18:12,036 --> 00:18:17,040
- Can’t we think of anything else to give her?
- Like, giving her a card...

204
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:21,072
- I don’t know, can’t we perform something? Make a...
- Yes! Something like...

205
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,028
- Something Moroccan?
- Something you’ll remember very well.

206
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:28,056
I don’t want to perform ...

207
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:35,080
[Hi Chris, do you have some
 money I can borrow? 
Like 1000 kr [118 USD]? 
It’s okay with less too,
 I promise you’ll get
 it back on the 1st of 
July, plus the 750 [88 USD]
 I owe you from beforehand.
 There’s just this top on sale
 right now that 
I’ve wanted for a really long time. 
And I don’t want to ask mom
 because I’ve borrowed 
a lot from her lately.]


208
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:32,032
It would be fun.

209
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,096
- We can hold a speech!
- Yes!

210
00:18:36,004 --> 00:18:38,080
- You can write it, right?
- Yes.

211
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:41,060
- And then we can ...
- Hi!

212
00:18:41,072 --> 00:18:44,008
Hi.

213
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:47,008
Are you going to that Eid party at Sana’s?

214
00:18:47,016 --> 00:18:49,096
Yeah.

215
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:53,024
- Are you going too?
- Yes, or uhm ...

216
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:56,048
Jonas asked if I wanted to come.

217
00:18:56,056 --> 00:19:02,096
And I was a little stressed because I don’t really
know anyone else who’s going.

218
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:09,028
But then I thought about Kosegruppa.
Yay ...

219
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:13,036
And then I thought that maybe you’re going?

220
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:17,012
Yeah, we’re going.
We’ll take care of you.

221
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,092
Great!

222
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,076
We have to take care of each other.

223
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:25,025
- See you later.
- Good bye!

224
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:33,068
- But ok ... Speech.
- Yes.
- What are we going to write?

225
00:19:33,076 --> 00:19:34,076


226
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:39,000
- Come in! Hi.
- Hi, do you have a few minutes?

227
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:45,088
I have two hours, seventeen minutes and fourteen seconds
until I’m going on summer vacation!

228
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:51,056
Welcome, Christina Berg.
Sit down.

229
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,036
- How do you know my name?
- I know the name of every student in this school.

230
00:20:00,044 --> 00:20:05,096
- What can I help you with?
- Uhm ...

231
00:20:06,096 --> 00:20:10,060
I just have this friend who ...

232
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,024
That’s not 'just' that.

233
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:19,032
There are lots of people who don’t have friends.

234
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Lots of people who are lonely.

235
00:20:23,048 --> 00:20:28,064
Take the retirement homes in Oslo, for example.
They’re overflowing with old people.

236
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:34,000
Think about that.
All of their friends are dead.

237
00:20:34,008 --> 00:20:39,016
No one comes to visit and they’re all by themselves.

238
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:46,056
All those people have, are the memories from a lost time.

239
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:54,028
That’s so fucking true!

240
00:20:55,032 --> 00:21:02,016
I haven’t thought about that before,
but if you get really, really old, -

241
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:06,060
And all your friend just ... die ...

242
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:11,028
- Then it’s not awesome to live at all.
- No.

243
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,064
Tell me about your friend.

244
00:21:30,036 --> 00:21:33,036
Yeah ...

245
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:39,060
I have a friend who I’m pretty worried about.

246
00:21:39,068 --> 00:21:45,024
I don’t think she has a good home life and ...

247
00:21:45,032 --> 00:21:49,016
I think her mom is pretty depressed.

248
00:21:49,024 --> 00:21:53,044
I feel like I should be a better friend, -

249
00:21:57,096 --> 00:22:01,064
But I’m not any good at that stuff and I can’t ...

250
00:22:01,072 --> 00:22:07,036
I can’t talk to her about it.

251
00:22:07,044 --> 00:22:12,084
So I was wondering if maybe you
could talk to her about it.

252
00:22:29,024 --> 00:22:35,072
You know what I think this sounds like, Christina?

253
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,096
I think it sounds like you’re lying.

254
00:22:39,004 --> 00:22:42,020
- Are you?
- No!

255
00:22:44,092 --> 00:22:51,088
Because what it sounds like is:
“I’m not good at that stuff”.

256
00:22:51,096 --> 00:22:55,044
But I think you are.

257
00:22:55,052 --> 00:23:02,020
I’m not! I’m seriously really bad at that stuff!
As soon as there is just a little conflict, I just ...

258
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:07,096
Everyone thinks conflicts are uncomfortable!

259
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:16,036
But that doesn’t mean you should avoid them!

260
00:23:19,008 --> 00:23:24,076
Do you know what, Christina Berg? I think you
should be very careful with these “truths” -

261
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:28,096
You tell to yourself about yourself.

262
00:23:29,004 --> 00:23:35,032
I don’t see what you’re describing
right now. Do you know what I see?

263
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,028
I see a girl who’s more
than enough of a good friend.

264
00:23:40,036 --> 00:23:43,076
I see a girl who
Talks to her friend.

265
00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:49,004
And I see a girl who loves conflict!

266
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:57,016
A bit over the top at the end.

267
00:23:57,028 --> 00:24:04,028
- But you know what I want?
- Yes.

268
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:26,085
[Did anyone remember to buy mustard and ketchup?]


269
00:24:27,024 --> 00:24:31,002
[Did anyone remember to 
buy mustard and ketchup?]


270
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:31,098
[We’re already in Urraparken. 
When are you coming?]

271
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:55,033
[I’m waiting for him. 
We’ve bought 
enough beer, right?]

272
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:55,033
[It’s important!]

273
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:55,033


274
00:24:55,037 --> 00:25:18,077
[For the third time, 
we’ve bought enough beer]

275
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:18,077
[Sorry. I just 
want his birthday to be perf.]

276
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:26,009
[You’re overreacting, he doesn’t 
give a fuck about ketchup]

277
00:25:26,009 --> 00:26:01,053
[Let me overreact.
 You don't know
 what he has to deal with
 the other 363 days of the year.]

278
00:25:47,089 --> 00:26:01,053
[He’s way too good for me]

279
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:12,081
[That’s not what I see. I see a boyfriend 
who’s more than good enough. Someone who
 has made a pretty mad boy into a pretty happy boy.]

280
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:16,006
[What’s up with you, Chris?]

281
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:18,056
- Hey.
- Hey.

282
00:26:24,092 --> 00:26:30,028
- You can open it yourself.
- Beer at school? Amazing!

283
00:26:31,004 --> 00:26:32,089
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

284
00:26:44,092 --> 00:26:48,044
- Did you find your film?
- No, I didn’t.

285
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:52,060
- I can’t find it. I don’t know where it is.
- It’s on YouTube!

286
00:26:52,072 --> 00:26:57,004
It’s on Youtube? That helps me a lot.
There are like ten billion videos there.

287
00:26:57,016 --> 00:27:03,000
But if you don’t understand the title,
you won’t get to see the film.

288
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:06,024
You can’t give me a little hint?

289
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,044
- It starts with G.
- G?

290
00:27:10,056 --> 00:27:12,039
I tried "Yellow curtains", but that wasn’t it.


291
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,037
You’re not that far off.

292
00:27:15,028 --> 00:27:19,040
"Green curtains"?
"Grey curtains"?

293
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:25,072
- "The Genius of Hartvig Nissen".
- I would never write that.

294
00:27:25,084 --> 00:27:29,076
- What is it then?
- I’m not telling.

295
00:27:32,004 --> 00:27:37,004
- "God"? God, that’s me.
- Yes, the film is called ‘God’.

296
00:27:37,016 --> 00:27:40,080
- Good. I’ll check it out later.
- Do you think I would call a film ‘God’?

297
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:44,020
- Yeah, if it was about me.
- That’s so pretentious.

298
00:27:56,012 --> 00:27:58,048
Get a room!
Fags!

299
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,032
What did he say?
What?!

300
00:28:02,044 --> 00:28:06,012
- What did you say?
- It’s fucking disgusting!

301
00:28:06,024 --> 00:28:11,068
Fuck! Huh? Do you think you can go
around and just do that stuff? Come here!

302
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,028
Fucking cunt face! You’re fucking ugly, you know that?

303
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:20,004
I can’t with that stuff. He can’t say stuff like that!

304
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,037
- Look at me.

305
00:28:20,017 --> 00:28:22,093
- Look at me.
- Yes. Yes!

306
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,080
It’s fine. Okay?

307
00:28:40,072 --> 00:28:43,060
We’ll take it totally chill.

308
00:28:43,072 --> 00:28:47,048
And we’ll go meet our friends.

309
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:51,012
And we’ll go to the park.

310
00:28:51,024 --> 00:28:53,048
And drink beer.

311
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,028
Okay?

312
00:29:00,036 --> 00:29:03,012
Yeah?

313
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:08,000
Okay?

314
00:29:25,008 --> 00:29:27,044
- Shall we leave?
- Yes.

315
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:11,008
What are you doing?

316
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:29,052


317
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:43,044
- Can’t you help me instead?
- I can’t write.

318
00:31:44,084 --> 00:31:47,068
You don’t know how to write?

319
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,036
I know you know how to write.

320
00:31:58,028 --> 00:32:01,092
Tell me a bit about her then.

321
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:13,053
[Hi, in the speech for Sana, you have to remember 
to include how insanely strong she is. I don’t think 
many people understand how much bullshit she
 has to take. Just something I thought of. ]


322
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:14,056
She seems a bit badass.

323
00:32:15,056 --> 00:32:18,016
No. Or. Not really.

324
00:32:18,028 --> 00:32:24,036
It’s just on the outside, like.

325
00:32:24,048 --> 00:32:28,084
Because she has a really soft side.

326
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:36,076
Like if it hadn't been for Sana,
then we wouldn’t be laying here.

327
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,080
It’s not because of that e-mail.

328
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:50,056
But once upon a time -

329
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:56,032
There was a person who persuaded me -

330
00:32:56,044 --> 00:33:00,008
To try and understand you, you know.

331
00:33:01,076 --> 00:33:09,024
But! But she’s a bit into,
or she’s really into science, right?

332
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,008
So I thought maybe that I
could write something about that.

333
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:20,024
Or like … Include something about science.

334
00:33:20,036 --> 00:33:26,024
So I thought that, or I tried to
write what was inside Sana’s atoms.

335
00:33:28,092 --> 00:33:31,020
Yes.

336
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:37,012
But it’s just turning into ...

337
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:42,000
No. It’s just a mess.

338
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,040


339
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:55,032
Linn! She’s called me 10 times today.
I’m not kidding.

340
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:00,000
Yes, Linn? Hello.

341
00:34:00,096 --> 00:34:04,004
- Hi.
- Yeah, hi.

342
00:34:05,072 --> 00:34:11,048
I was just wondering if you could remember
to buy toilet paper on your way home.

343
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,096
Yes, I just. I don’t know how long I’ll be.

344
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:22,036
So if it’s, if it’s a real emergency
you’re just going to have to buy it yourself, okay?

345
00:34:24,024 --> 00:34:26,024
Okay.

346
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:31,000
- When are you coming home then?
- I don’t know yet, Linn.

347
00:34:31,012 --> 00:34:36,072
I’m just going to have to see,
because I have a few things to do and stuff.

348
00:34:36,084 --> 00:34:43,004
- Are you going to sleep at home tonight?
- Yeah, yes, I’m sure I will. Maybe.

349
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:48,020
Maybe we can watch Twenty Years with Espen Eckbo together?

350
00:34:48,032 --> 00:34:52,012
- Yeah, maybe. Okay?
- Okay.

351
00:34:55,064 --> 00:34:58,040
- Bye.
- Bye.

352
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,084
Okay.

353
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:11,028
Atoms. Science.

354
00:35:12,048 --> 00:35:17,008
- Didn’t you have science?
- Yeah.

355
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,076
Well, then help me.

356
00:35:28,076 --> 00:35:32,040
You can write about the butterfly effect.

357
00:35:32,052 --> 00:35:35,044
What’s that?

358
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,084
A concept within the chaos theory.

359
00:36:34,084 --> 00:36:37,000
Look.

360
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,004
You look so good, Linn!

361
00:36:41,016 --> 00:36:44,004
You’re so pretty.

362
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:53,008
- Can’t I just wear the blue summer dress?
- No, you can’t just wear the blue summer dress!

363
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:59,052
Okay, this is the most important holiday to Muslims.
It’s not a whore and pimp party.

364
00:37:00,072 --> 00:37:04,052
- But do I have to wear a veil?
- Yes, you have to wear a veil, Linn.

365
00:37:04,064 --> 00:37:10,000
It’s like if Sana showed up to your
place on Christmas in sweatpants.

366
00:37:10,012 --> 00:37:16,008
Do you think your mother, Mette, would’ve been happy about that?
She wouldn’t. She would’ve been angry.

367
00:37:20,068 --> 00:37:25,044
Linn ... What’s up with you these days?

368
00:37:30,088 --> 00:37:35,060
Do you think Noora is going to move out?

369
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:45,000
Come sit down.

370
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:09,000
You know that Noora loves us a lot, right?

371
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:16,076
And that.. Even though
we’re not fans of William ...

372
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:20,040
Noora is much better than him.

373
00:38:20,052 --> 00:38:25,052
But she should be allowed to live her life, right?

374
00:38:28,024 --> 00:38:32,004
And I think we just have
to be very good friends to her -

375
00:38:32,016 --> 00:38:35,092
And support her
no matter what she does.

376
00:38:40,048 --> 00:38:46,000
And I think that even though
she doesn’t always show it, -

377
00:38:46,012 --> 00:38:49,096
Noora loves us very much.

378
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:52,096
And wants us to be happy.

379
00:38:54,044 --> 00:38:57,040
And we’re going to be happy.

380
00:39:01,024 --> 00:39:03,052
And you know why?

381
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,060
Because we have each other.

382
00:39:09,008 --> 00:39:12,000
And I’m going to take care of you.

383
00:39:14,048 --> 00:39:17,068
And you’re going to take care of me.

384
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,076
It’s you and me against the world.

385
00:39:44,068 --> 00:39:47,028
The two of us against the world.

386
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,020
You look so nice!

387
00:39:56,032 --> 00:40:00,076
I also want one.
A veil, but I can’t.

388
00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:11,020
Should we drink some Pepsi Max?

389
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,035
You had a booger.

390
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:21,044
- He’s the one who bought the toilet paper rolls.
- Oh, that’s right!
- Where did they end up?

391
00:41:21,056 --> 00:41:25,085
I just sold them to some friends
at the Mosque. Nothing big.


392
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:27,025
Oh, okay.

393
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:32,000
- Eid mubarak! Eid mubarak.
- Hi!

394
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,020
- Hi. Welcome.
- Thank you.

395
00:41:37,032 --> 00:41:39,036
- And I just wanted to say Eid mubarak!
- Eid mubarak!


396
00:41:39,052 --> 00:41:41,044
- Eid mubarak.
- You look so nice!

397
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:45,072
Thanks! I’m the one who chose
the outfits for tonight.

398
00:41:45,084 --> 00:41:49,044
I went to Grøndland and did some shopping.

399
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:55,040
- Hijab and everything.
- Hijab and everything!

400
00:41:55,052 --> 00:42:00,032
And I brought a little present!
I brought a gift for the hostess.

401
00:42:00,044 --> 00:42:05,040
It’s two boreks that I put in a nice box.

402
00:42:05,052 --> 00:42:09,065
- That’s very nice of you.
- You can put it on the table for the guests.


403
00:42:08,033 --> 00:42:10,045
- Yes, thank you so much.

404
00:42:10,064 --> 00:42:17,052
- And I didn’t find an Eid mubarak card, so I bought
a Merry Christmas card, because it’s the same.
- Aww, thank you.

405
00:42:17,064 --> 00:42:22,052
- And you look very nice. Much nicer than ... Yeah.
- Thanks.

406
00:42:22,064 --> 00:42:26,036
Very pretty. And you too, even though you
haven’t dressed up. In your own way.

407
00:42:26,048 --> 00:42:32,076
You didn’t go for an ‘original’ outfit,
but you look very nice.

408
00:42:32,088 --> 00:42:36,088
We’re more cultured.

409
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,008
Are you going to say anything?

410
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:46,008
- It’s been a while since you’ve had this?
- We ate this every day after school.

411
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,037
Why don’t you try making it yourself?


412
00:42:48,061 --> 00:42:52,024
- There are so many spices and herbs and ...
- Expensive?

413
00:42:52,076 --> 00:42:56,028
No, it’s not really expensive, it’s just
a totally different way of cooking.

414
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:03,004
Can’t we just have an afternoon where we ... I mean you,
just make a lot of Moroccan food for me?

415
00:43:03,016 --> 00:43:04,086
Yeah, it’s a date.


416
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:08,046
- Great.
- And some delicious tea.

417
00:43:12,012 --> 00:43:13,065
These potatoes are really good.


418
00:43:13,073 --> 00:43:15,097
Yeah, it’s good? Let me have a taste.


419
00:43:14,093 --> 00:43:17,046
They’re not like Norwegian potatoes.

420
00:43:22,012 --> 00:43:24,084
Delicious!
Potato salad.

421
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:33,080
- Are those just normal meatballs?
- No, it’s in a pretty hot sauce.

422
00:43:33,092 --> 00:43:35,089
- Chili!
- Hot sauce, yeah.


423
00:43:42,024 --> 00:43:46,092
- Are we going on a vacation together?
- What kind of vacation?

424
00:43:47,004 --> 00:43:48,029
I wanna do stuff with you.


425
00:43:49,021 --> 00:43:50,025
We’re doing that anyway.

426
00:43:50,036 --> 00:43:54,080
Yeah, but ... It would be awesome
to go abroad or something.

427
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:58,008
But I’m so impulsive - I can’t plan that stuff.

428
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,073
I can check out plane tickets
to Morocco or something.


429
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:02,053
Seriously?

430
00:44:03,028 --> 00:44:05,066
Yeah. Wouldn’t that be cozy?
The two of us in Marrakech?


431
00:44:05,081 --> 00:44:07,043
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

432
00:44:07,056 --> 00:44:08,065
I’ve always wanted to go.


433
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,040
Then I’ll check it out.

434
00:44:11,008 --> 00:44:13,094
Dad sent me a lot of money for summer, so ...

435
00:44:14,021 --> 00:44:19,018
Chill! Plus all the tips I get at Kaffebrenneriet.

436
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,023
Yeah, right.

437
00:44:22,056 --> 00:44:25,008
Where?

438
00:44:28,016 --> 00:44:32,008
- Isn’t your car ...?
- The car?

439
00:44:38,053 --> 00:44:39,041
Wow.


440
00:44:40,065 --> 00:44:42,013
It’s not far.

441
00:44:41,017 --> 00:44:43,009
We haven’t done it in that car, have we?

442
00:44:43,096 --> 00:44:47,004
No. Let’s do it.

443
00:44:47,016 --> 00:44:50,092
- Hi.
- Hi!

444
00:44:51,004 --> 00:44:56,020
It’s just that Linn wanted to say something.
I don’t know what.

445
00:44:56,032 --> 00:45:00,044
But she really wanted to talk a bit.

446
00:45:02,084 --> 00:45:06,052
We just wanted to say
that we love you a lot.

447
00:45:06,064 --> 00:45:13,080
And that if you want to move in
with William, we support you.

448
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:18,044
Aww! Oh my God, you’re so cute, but I haven’t ...

449
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:24,036
It’s so nice that you’re supportive.
That makes me very happy.

450
00:45:24,048 --> 00:45:28,004
But I’m not going to move.

451
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:33,056
- Aren’t you going to move in with William?
- No.

452
00:45:34,092 --> 00:45:37,060
You’re choosing us over William?

453
00:45:37,072 --> 00:45:43,028
I’m not choosing anyone over anyone. I just ...
We’re just not moving in together yet.

454
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,025
Yeah, but you’re choosing us over William.


455
00:45:45,061 --> 00:45:50,043
Oh my God, then we’re ... We’re Kollektivet together!
- Yeah.

456
00:45:51,008 --> 00:45:54,072
Yeah! Kollektivet! Kollektivet!
Jump and dance and be happy.

457
00:45:54,084 --> 00:46:00,048
Oh, I have an idea! William can
move in with us and we’ll be four!

458
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:05,004
It’ll be cheaper with toilet paper and dish soap
and everything that’s cheap and good.

459
00:46:05,016 --> 00:46:11,048
Maybe if we make a Powerpoint presentation and
sell it a bit better, you can decide later.

460
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:16,008
If you agree, Linn? Do you agree?
It’ll be so fucking good.

461
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:22,092
It’ll be a fashion Kollektiv! We can have guests over and ...
Oh! You smell good!

462
00:46:23,004 --> 00:46:25,029
- Thanks you too.
- Yeah, he does.


463
00:46:25,065 --> 00:46:27,041
Thanks. New perfume.

464
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:33,060
Eskild! Hands off.
My man.

465
00:46:33,072 --> 00:46:39,036
Yeah. Your man, but when we all move in together,
we’re going to share a lot of stuff.

466
00:46:39,048 --> 00:46:42,016
- Him? No.
- Yeah, him too.

467
00:46:42,028 --> 00:46:47,092
Shampoo and William and ...
Dish soap and everything else.

468
00:46:48,004 --> 00:46:52,028
We can have Sunday board game night
where we can play Ludo and stuff.

469
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,092
- The three of us can do that.
- But then we’ll only be three, not four.

470
00:46:56,004 --> 00:47:03,048
It’s so boring with only three.
You can have the blue chip, Linn can have the green one.

471
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:09,024
You can have the red one. Because of the lipstick!
Not because of something else.

472
00:47:09,036 --> 00:47:13,040
- Good watermelon.
- You’ve had that before, at least.

473
00:47:13,052 --> 00:47:14,045
It’s not Moroccan.

474
00:47:14,045 --> 00:47:20,045
Yeah. Even fed me lots of delicious food a few moments ago. Very, very good.

475
00:47:18,084 --> 00:47:21,029
He has had it before.

476
00:47:21,064 --> 00:47:24,088
We have to celebrate!
The both of us got 6’es!

477
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,016
- Yeah, I got a 6 at least.
- I got a 6 too.

478
00:47:28,028 --> 00:47:29,017
Why are you lying?


479
00:47:29,036 --> 00:47:30,025
I did!

480
00:47:29,097 --> 00:47:31,029
You didn’t get a 6.


481
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:38,008
- You didn’t know ... I had to help you!
- Yeah, you helped me and then I got a 6.

482
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,076
I didn’t help you that much.

483
00:47:40,088 --> 00:47:46,004
Wow! You tried to help me
a bit, but not enough.

484
00:47:46,016 --> 00:47:51,092
No, but I thought ‘Wow, he doesn’t even know the basics’.

485
00:47:52,004 --> 00:47:53,093
You can’t have gotten more than a 5, tops.


486
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,089
- I got a 6.
- You can tell me.


487
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:57,081
- No.
- Tell me you got a 5. It’s okay.

488
00:47:58,052 --> 00:48:01,001
I’m just getting shy because you’re so beautiful today!

489
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:03,073
Awww, thanks.


490
00:48:04,009 --> 00:48:07,037
- Like seriously, you’re very beautiful.
- Thanks.

491
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,053
But uhm ... No.. I got a 5.


492
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:13,024
- Yeah, you got a 5?
- Yeah, but don’t tell anyone.

493
00:48:13,024 --> 00:48:17,008
Yeah, but it’s ok.
I got a 6!

494
00:48:20,008 --> 00:48:23,000
- Hey, girl.
- Hey.

495
00:48:24,016 --> 00:48:27,004
- Good food.
- Very good.

496
00:48:27,016 --> 00:48:31,072
So good. I think I’m on
plate number four or something.

497
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:42,080
Okay, I have to say something.

498
00:48:42,092 --> 00:48:45,060
What?

499
00:48:52,088 --> 00:48:58,016
I just wanted to say that if ...
If you need someone to talk to ...

500
00:48:59,068 --> 00:49:02,088
I’m here.
Okay?

501
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:11,092
We can talk about difficult stuff.

502
00:49:23,008 --> 00:49:27,052
Do you know why you’re
my very best friend?

503
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:38,096
It’s because ...
No matter how bad of a day I’m having, -

504
00:49:39,008 --> 00:49:43,036
You always find a way to make me laugh.

505
00:49:53,012 --> 00:49:58,004
It’s not like you always have to talk.

506
00:49:59,036 --> 00:50:05,032
Sometimes, it just helps to
pretend that you’re fine.

507
00:50:13,048 --> 00:50:18,060
But it’s important that you
have someone to talk to, right?

508
00:50:18,072 --> 00:50:21,056
I do.

509
00:50:22,068 --> 00:50:27,028
We talked about going to Morocco.
Should be bring the guys?

510
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:33,064
Of course, it’s a boys’ trip.
Boys’ trip in Morocco. It can go very wrong. It’s worth a shot.

511
00:50:37,088 --> 00:50:40,055
- Hi. Are you okay?
- Yes.


512
00:50:40,055 --> 00:50:42,037
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

513
00:50:42,052 --> 00:50:48,016
Yeah, good. I was just wondering
who’s going to hold Sana’s speech.

514
00:50:48,064 --> 00:50:51,001
Wow! Ingrid, do you want to try?


515
00:50:52,025 --> 00:50:54,045
The closest thing I’ve tried is one of those juice cleanses,
and it didn’t work very well.


516
00:50:54,045 --> 00:50:56,061
Yeah, but that’s just drinking juice. They can’t drink.

517
00:50:56,061 --> 00:50:58,005
- You can’t even drink?
- No.

518
00:50:58,012 --> 00:50:59,093
- Not even water?
- No.

519
00:51:03,076 --> 00:51:06,025
Then this has to be fantastic.
A celebration with lots of food and ...


520
00:51:06,025 --> 00:51:07,009
Yeah, I know, right?

521
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:11,085
I just had some salad before. With tomatoes and ...


522
00:51:11,085 --> 00:51:13,090
- Tomatoes? Ew. I don’t like them.
- Why not?

523
00:51:13,096 --> 00:51:19,084
- They’re slimy and gross.
- They’re not. You eat ketchup all the time. That’s tomatoes.

524
00:51:19,096 --> 00:51:23,009
No, it’s not! It’s the stuff
inside the tomato that’s gross.

525
00:51:23,009 --> 00:51:25,020
- Yeah, but like..
- The mushy stuff.

526
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:29,032
- Just don’t eat that part then.
- Eat the part around it? Yeah, that’s good.

527
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:32,093
You don’t have a lot of delicious stuff on your plate either.
What’s that purple stuff?


528
00:51:32,093 --> 00:51:35,001
- That’s ...
- Yeah.

529
00:51:35,028 --> 00:51:38,016
I think it’s ...

530
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:44,084
- You think it’s better than tomatoes?
- I haven’t tried it. It was okay.

531
00:51:44,096 --> 00:51:45,097
It seemed very delicious.


532
00:51:46,044 --> 00:51:49,045
There’s lots of good food here!
Have you tried these?


533
00:51:49,093 --> 00:51:52,050
- No.
- They’re so good, you have to try them.

534
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:59,008
- I didn’t even know they had that here.
- They’re like meatballs. Like the best I’ve ever had.

535
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,092
- I know, right?
- Where?

536
00:52:02,004 --> 00:52:06,084
I found them at the other end of the table.
In a big pot.

537
00:52:43,096 --> 00:52:46,028
Hey.

538
00:52:54,052 --> 00:52:56,096
Who are you?

539
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,044
Chris.

540
00:53:02,088 --> 00:53:05,048
Your new boyfriend.

541
00:53:08,064 --> 00:53:11,076
Hi, my new boyfriend.

542
00:53:42,004 --> 00:53:44,088
What’s even happening right now?

543
00:53:50,092 --> 00:53:54,064
I think we’ve been ditched.

544
00:54:02,064 --> 00:54:07,096
You have a little ...
You have something there.

545
00:54:08,008 --> 00:54:10,056
- Here?
- No, on the other side.

546
00:54:10,068 --> 00:54:14,044
Where? Here?
Take it off!

547
00:54:39,072 --> 00:54:43,024
Eva, do you wanna hold
the speech for Sana?

548
00:54:42,066 --> 00:54:54,060
[Hey, girl. Is the party any good?]

549
00:54:55,042 --> 00:55:10,000
[Really  good]

550
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
[I’ve been here today.]

551
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:25,020
[One day, I’m bringing you there]

552
00:55:36,052 --> 00:55:38,096
It’s time for the speech.

553
00:55:39,092 --> 00:55:43,080
Speech, speech, speech!

554
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I didn’t write it. It was Noora.

555
00:55:56,012 --> 00:55:59,036
And William!
And Isak helped a bit.

556
00:56:05,088 --> 00:56:10,052
Dear Sana.
This speech is for you.

557
00:56:14,044 --> 00:56:17,048
And you’re getting it because
what you’re inviting us to today, -

558
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:21,088
Overthrows American
presidents tomorrow.

559
00:56:23,092 --> 00:56:29,020
We live in a chaotic world where
it’s difficult to understand the rules.

560
00:56:29,032 --> 00:56:32,056
Because why are some people poor,
and other people rich?

561
00:56:32,068 --> 00:56:36,052
Why do some people have to be refugees,
while others are safe?

562
00:56:36,064 --> 00:56:40,088
Why are some people spit on
in the street?

563
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:47,056
And why is it that sometimes, even though you try
to do something good, it’s still met with hate?

564
00:56:47,068 --> 00:56:53,016
It’s not weird that people give up,
that they stop believing in the good.

565
00:56:57,048 --> 00:57:01,060
But thank you so much
for not giving up, Sana.

566
00:57:03,096 --> 00:57:09,076
Because even though it sometimes feels like it,
no one’s ever alone.

567
00:57:09,088 --> 00:57:14,004
Each and every one of us
is a part of the big chaos.

568
00:57:14,016 --> 00:57:18,032
And what you do today,
has an effect tomorrow.


569
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:19,068
[We should maybe ask someone for advice.]

570
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:23,004
It can be hard to say,
exactly what kind of effect.

571
00:57:23,016 --> 00:57:30,036
And you usually can’t see
how everything fits together.


572
00:57:26,033 --> 00:57:27,073
[We have to take care of each other.]

573
00:57:30,048 --> 00:57:37,004
But the effects of your actions,
are always there. Somewhere in the chaos.

574
00:57:39,032 --> 00:57:43,024
In a hundred years,
we may have machines that can, -

575
00:57:43,036 --> 00:57:46,060
Predict the effect of every action.

576
00:57:46,072 --> 00:57:50,020
But until then, we can trust this:

577
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,032
Fear spreads.

578
00:57:57,028 --> 00:57:59,028
But:

579
00:58:19,032 --> 00:58:22,032
Fortunately, love does too.
