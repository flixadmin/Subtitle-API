1
00:00:01,693 --> 00:00:04,027
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,684
Valerie Vale, Gotham Gazette.
This isn't the first time

3
00:00:09,752 --> 00:00:11,019
that a bounty hunter has apprehended

4
00:00:11,086 --> 00:00:13,054
an escapee. Is the GCPD

5
00:00:13,122 --> 00:00:15,256
incapable of handling
this threat themselves?

6
00:00:15,324 --> 00:00:16,758
Your body is beginning
to reject the changes

7
00:00:16,826 --> 00:00:18,526
we made to your DNA.

8
00:00:18,594 --> 00:00:19,494
How do I fix it?

9
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:22,564
Strange. He's the only one.

10
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:24,299
You remember Marv.

11
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:25,333
He's one of yours.

12
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:28,336
Hey, kid. Take it.

13
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,215
Keep feeding strays, one's
gonna follow you home.

14
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:31,810
While trapped in Indian
Hill, I was led to believe

15
00:00:31,878 --> 00:00:34,113
an unnamed group had taken
control of my company.

16
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,649
I want to talk face-to-face, or
the information that I've gathered

17
00:00:36,716 --> 00:00:37,883
will be sent to every newspaper

18
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:39,418
and television station in Gotham.

19
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:41,387
- We caught a spy.
- Ivy?

20
00:00:41,454 --> 00:00:43,088
- No!
- Marv?

21
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:48,761
Ivy?

22
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:50,396
Alfred!

23
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:53,666
Alfred!

24
00:01:01,241 --> 00:01:02,622
Bruce.

25
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,744
You wanted to talk.

26
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:12,117
Forgive me.

27
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:16,789
Better?

28
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:20,059
I know you.

29
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,195
I've seen you at Wayne
Enterprises events.

30
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:27,800
You've been inside my home.

31
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:30,235
My name is Kathryn.

32
00:01:30,303 --> 00:01:33,639
I represent the group
you've asked to speak with.

33
00:01:33,707 --> 00:01:35,441
You didn't have to hurt Alfred.

34
00:01:35,508 --> 00:01:38,410
He would not have permitted
you to meet with us alone.

35
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:40,279
You tried to kill me.

36
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:43,549
You were behind Indian Hill.
Hugo Strange was hired by you.

37
00:01:43,616 --> 00:01:46,151
Is that why you're here, Bruce?

38
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:49,588
To ask questions you
already know the answers to?

39
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,591
Who are you?

40
00:01:53,423 --> 00:01:54,560
What do you call yourselves?

41
00:01:54,627 --> 00:01:56,695
Our name is unimportant.

42
00:01:58,398 --> 00:02:00,299
Now,

43
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:02,334
you made a threat.

44
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:08,764
Referring to evidence you'd
uncovered of our existence.

45
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:13,112
We would like to know what you found.

46
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:16,042
Nothing certain.

47
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,085
Until now.

48
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:22,047
A bluff.

49
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,957
- Nicely played.
- It wasn't just a bluff.

50
00:02:25,024 --> 00:02:26,392
The more I studied my company's doings,

51
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,527
the more there were things
that could only be explained

52
00:02:28,595 --> 00:02:29,940
by your existence.

53
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:33,365
Still, I had to know for sure.

54
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:34,533
Now I do.

55
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:36,235
And what now?

56
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:39,004
According to you, we
tried to kill you once.

57
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:40,639
I began all this because
I wanted to solve

58
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:42,274
my parents' murder.

59
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:45,162
Six months ago, I concluded
your organization responsible.

60
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:47,613
- Have you changed your mind?
- No.

61
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,185
But there are other...

62
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:54,686
considerations.

63
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:57,057
Such as your own life.

64
00:02:57,994 --> 00:03:00,826
The lives of those close to you.

65
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,665
You're here to make a deal.

66
00:03:07,142 --> 00:03:09,234
What do you have to offer?

67
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:10,836
Wayne Enterprises.

68
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:14,306
You cannot give someone
what they already possess.

69
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:15,974
I'm not finished.

70
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:20,379
If I die, my shares will be turned over

71
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:21,928
to the federal government.

72
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:26,652
Investigators will comb through
every file, every asset.

73
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,654
Are you prepared for
that kind of scrutiny?

74
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:30,789
That would be unfortunate,

75
00:03:30,857 --> 00:03:33,559
but we would weather the storm.

76
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:36,711
- What else?
- The Wayne name still has meaning.

77
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:40,799
It's a symbol of light and hope.

78
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:43,302
For a group such as yours,

79
00:03:43,369 --> 00:03:45,704
I could provide a useful distraction.

80
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:49,241
You are an impressive young man.

81
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:52,010
Still,

82
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:55,147
your offer is not sufficient.

83
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:57,783
We will also require that you cease

84
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:01,286
all investigation into our existence

85
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:03,121
and your parents' murder.

86
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:06,459
Any violation of that, in the slightest,

87
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,962
and our agreement is void.

88
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:16,650
I need your answer now.

89
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:31,183
I agree.

90
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:33,585
I'm happy to hear that.

91
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:36,288
Needless to say, you
will not see me again.

92
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:37,956
Good-bye, Bruce.

93
00:04:59,444 --> 00:05:02,346
Morning. Surprised to see me?

94
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:04,348
Not really. What do you want?

95
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,723
- I have a proposition.
- Not interested.

96
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:08,886
Oh, come on. Think of it as a way

97
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:10,321
to say "I'm sorry for handcuffing you

98
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:12,857
to a car door." Except I'm not.

99
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,894
Wow. So this is where you live.

100
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:19,697
Anyone considering a life in
bounty hunting should see this.

101
00:05:19,765 --> 00:05:21,065
Preferably wearing a hazmat suit.

102
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:22,651
You don't bring women here, do you?

103
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:25,369
All right.

104
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:27,405
Fish Mooney.

105
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:29,404
Penguin's million-dollar bounty.

106
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:30,906
I can help you get it.

107
00:05:33,564 --> 00:05:35,613
Ooh, see, now you're thinking,

108
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,046
"A million dollars,

109
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,181
that can buy me a lot of scotch."

110
00:05:39,248 --> 00:05:41,450
But, hey, when you're
rich, do everyone a favor,

111
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:43,785
spring for a maid, will you?
Or just firebomb the place

112
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:45,354
and be done with it.

113
00:05:47,657 --> 00:05:49,503
What's in it for you?

114
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:52,050
- A story.
- That's it?

115
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:55,364
It shocks you that I love my
job and I want to be good at it?

116
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:56,565
Kinda.

117
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:59,133
Why not just bring her in yourself?

118
00:06:00,521 --> 00:06:02,654
Why give me a million dollars?

119
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:05,340
Because I'm a bigger person than you.

120
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:09,444
And...

121
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:10,912
because I couldn't find her.

122
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,782
Ah. You lost touch with your source.

123
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,150
The one working for Mooney.

124
00:06:15,218 --> 00:06:17,319
I did not lose touch with my source.

125
00:06:17,387 --> 00:06:19,806
I just have no way of contacting her.

126
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:21,195
She always found me.

127
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:23,225
Oh, well, that's better.

128
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,762
It's a million dollars.

129
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:29,197
Don't be so damn lazy. I mean,

130
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:32,401
that's your job, right? Your
specialty. You find people.

131
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:34,736
You're a bounty hunter.

132
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:39,307
- Who's your source?
- So we have a deal?

133
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:42,110
No handcuffing this time.

134
00:06:42,178 --> 00:06:44,946
- Who's your source?
- She's a petty thief.

135
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:48,050
A street kid. I like her
though. She's got style.

136
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:52,087
- What's her name?
- Selina Kyle.

137
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:54,489
You two ever cross paths
when you were a cop?

138
00:06:54,557 --> 00:06:56,324
Once or twice.

139
00:06:56,392 --> 00:06:58,560
Well, that's great. So
you know where she lives.

140
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:00,409
No. Not a clue.

141
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:05,153
But I know someone who might.

142
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:15,010
Oh... my... God.

143
00:07:15,078 --> 00:07:16,511
Hello, Barbara.

144
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:18,580
"Hello, Barbara"?

145
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:20,515
Is that all I get?

146
00:07:21,412 --> 00:07:24,186
- How you been?
- Oh. How've I been?

147
00:07:24,253 --> 00:07:26,021
Well, see for yourself.

148
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:28,857
I mean, it's no art gallery,
but there's less chance

149
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:30,905
of me dying of boredom.

150
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:33,195
How's Lee?

151
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,464
We're not together.

152
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:37,399
No. I thought by now

153
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:39,601
you would've chased her
down, put a ring on it.

154
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:42,604
Did you dump her? Oh, I bet you
dumped her, didn't you? You're such

155
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:44,906
- a heartbreaker.
- I feel like I walked into something.

156
00:07:44,974 --> 00:07:46,975
'Cause you did. Who are you?

157
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:49,277
Valerie Vale. I work for TheGazette.

158
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:52,114
- We're working on a project.
- I bet.

159
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:54,030
She your new girlfriend?

160
00:07:54,052 --> 00:07:55,283
- No.
- No.

161
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:58,720
Jim and I were engaged.

162
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:00,661
Until I called it off.

163
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:04,359
Uh-huh. We're looking for Selina.

164
00:08:04,427 --> 00:08:07,362
Oh, wait, I remember
this. You kidnapped him

165
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,731
and his girlfriend, held
them hostage in a church.

166
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:11,733
Aren't you supposed to be in Arkham?

167
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:15,702
I was, but turns out I'm totally sane.

168
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:17,472
Got a paper proving it.

169
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,008
Yeah. Signed by Hugo Strange. Again,

170
00:08:20,076 --> 00:08:22,222
Selina, have you seen her?

171
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:26,815
A kiss.

172
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:29,652
That's my price.

173
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:33,428
Is she serious? Are-are you serious?

174
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,258
Do it.

175
00:08:40,016 --> 00:08:41,096
Never mind.

176
00:08:41,164 --> 00:08:45,066
You're honestly no fun.

177
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:47,202
Try her squat down on Drake and Powell.

178
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,970
That's it? I've already been there.

179
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:53,041
She may have mentioned an
old bank near Kane Sound.

180
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:56,978
Jim.

181
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:03,185
I had a dream about you the other night.

182
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:05,887
You were in this horrible accident,

183
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:08,490
and you lost both of your legs,

184
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:12,003
and then I had to push you
around in a giant baby carriage.

185
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:16,298
Good seeing you, Barbara.

186
00:09:18,401 --> 00:09:20,097
Do not.

187
00:09:25,575 --> 00:09:28,276
So you really think Fish is
using the bank as an old base?

188
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:29,845
If I had to bet, yeah.

189
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:32,714
Me, too. So how 'bout I call the GCPD,

190
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:34,783
give them the exclusive,

191
00:09:34,851 --> 00:09:38,050
they take in Fish, and you get squat?

192
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:44,659
Hey. Open the door.

193
00:09:44,727 --> 00:09:46,428
You should've let me
come to find Peabody.

194
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,662
- Vale!
- And, you know what,

195
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,065
- I like your ex.
- Vale! Hey! Hey!

196
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,294
Hey there.

197
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,429
You all right?

198
00:10:54,996 --> 00:10:56,998
Thirsty.

199
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:00,368
I-I don't have anything on me,

200
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:02,704
but I live just up the road.

201
00:11:02,772 --> 00:11:04,272
What's your name?

202
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,047
Ivy.

203
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:14,826
My name's Ivy.

204
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:32,934
Barnes is gonna want to
known where you got this.

205
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,092
Oh, come on, you know I
can't give up my source.

206
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,794
Don't forget our deal. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

207
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,129
As soon as Fish Mooney's booked,

208
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:39,263
you get first crack at her,

209
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,799
but for now stay out of the way.

210
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,167
All right.

211
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,947
All right, fellas, listen up!

212
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,202
We don't know what we're
gonna find in there,

213
00:11:47,236 --> 00:11:50,305
so rule number one is be careful.

214
00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:52,473
And keep your eyes
peeled for Ethel Peabody.

215
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:56,044
She's the state witness that
was abducted last night.

216
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:57,412
I don't have to tell you guys

217
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,414
that this is the call
we've been waiting for.

218
00:11:59,481 --> 00:12:02,984
Let's go in there and end
this thing once and for all.

219
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:17,532
Oh, we have

220
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,567
company.

221
00:12:20,536 --> 00:12:21,536
GCPD!

222
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:24,038
Don't nobody move!

223
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,789
Get Sebring a medic now.

224
00:13:14,857 --> 00:13:17,525
Anyone see Mooney?

225
00:13:17,593 --> 00:13:19,727
For months, I warned

226
00:13:19,795 --> 00:13:21,629
the police about the threat to our city

227
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:25,833
posed by Hugo Strange's freaks,
by the murderer Fish Mooney,

228
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:27,468
and how did they protect you?

229
00:13:27,536 --> 00:13:29,237
They said that Fish Mooney wasn't real.

230
00:13:29,304 --> 00:13:30,938
That these escapees

231
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:33,241
were victims who need our help.

232
00:13:33,308 --> 00:13:35,410
Well, Fish Mooney was real.

233
00:13:35,477 --> 00:13:38,880
And once she was cornered
by the GCPD, finally,

234
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:40,314
they let her escape.

235
00:13:40,382 --> 00:13:42,250
And these "victims"...

236
00:13:42,317 --> 00:13:44,419
Well, I, for one, am not afraid

237
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:47,989
to call them by their
proper name: monsters!

238
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:49,857
Our city

239
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:52,260
is being invaded by monsters,

240
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:54,562
attacking our brothers and sisters,

241
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,763
and it is up to us!

242
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:57,331
To you!

243
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:59,767
To kill every monster you see!

244
00:13:59,835 --> 00:14:00,902
Who is with me?

245
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:10,813
Master Bruce, wake up.

246
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:12,415
Come on.

247
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:14,550
Wake up, Master B.

248
00:14:14,618 --> 00:14:16,225
Master B, wake up.

249
00:14:18,522 --> 00:14:20,156
Here you go, sunshine.

250
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:22,525
Morning.

251
00:14:22,593 --> 00:14:24,060
You all right?

252
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:25,595
How did I get back here?

253
00:14:25,662 --> 00:14:26,996
I don't know; I got the foggiest.

254
00:14:27,064 --> 00:14:28,464
I mean, I just came in
here to call the police

255
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:29,799
and-and then I found you.

256
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:31,342
Alfred.

257
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:34,203
You all right?

258
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:35,869
You all right, then.

259
00:14:37,074 --> 00:14:38,241
You know, I reckon it was
that sameckonit was thate

260
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:39,876
masked bastard that
knocked me spark out.

261
00:14:39,943 --> 00:14:43,381
I mean, he came in and out
without so much as a peep.

262
00:14:49,768 --> 00:14:51,721
I saw them, Alfred.

263
00:14:53,724 --> 00:14:55,691
I spoke to them.

264
00:14:56,383 --> 00:14:58,351
And?

265
00:14:58,419 --> 00:14:59,652
It worked.

266
00:15:03,557 --> 00:15:05,825
They agreed.

267
00:15:06,342 --> 00:15:09,062
What, just-just like that?

268
00:15:10,464 --> 00:15:11,898
I mean, you talked about the stuff

269
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:13,466
that we-we talked about, right?

270
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:16,502
Yes.

271
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:22,642
But I had to promise not to
investigate them anymore.

272
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,210
Not Indian Hill,

273
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:27,162
not the corruption within my company,

274
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:29,473
not my parents' murder.

275
00:15:34,288 --> 00:15:35,891
I see.

276
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,491
Alfred.

277
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:41,461
It was the only way.

278
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:46,833
You weren't the only one
they threatened, were you?

279
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,238
Hey?

280
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:54,340
No.

281
00:15:56,143 --> 00:15:58,411
Do you intend on keeping your word?

282
00:16:00,447 --> 00:16:02,582
Yes.

283
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:04,150
I do.

284
00:16:07,154 --> 00:16:08,955
And how do you know...

285
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:11,357
they will keep theirs?

286
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,835
Hey, Alvarez, where's Bullock?

287
00:16:22,903 --> 00:16:24,771
He's not back from the old bank yet.

288
00:16:24,838 --> 00:16:27,106
You missed a big payday, Gordon.

289
00:16:27,174 --> 00:16:28,608
We nabbed five of those freaks.

290
00:16:28,675 --> 00:16:30,962
Yeah, trusted the wrong person.

291
00:16:31,052 --> 00:16:32,486
I know the feeling.

292
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:35,815
Can we call this even?

293
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:38,284
You got me. I got you.

294
00:16:38,352 --> 00:16:40,620
It's over. Let me buy you a drink.

295
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:47,019
Yeah... it's over when I get Fish.

296
00:16:47,087 --> 00:16:48,464
You can read about it.

297
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:55,168
I do not want to get in trouble.

298
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:58,905
Odd as it might seem, I
do enjoy working here.

299
00:16:58,972 --> 00:17:00,139
I'm just looking to find Fish.

300
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:02,175
I do that, everybody wins.

301
00:17:02,242 --> 00:17:03,476
Fine.

302
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:04,944
You know she's sick.

303
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:06,379
That's the reason for those drugs

304
00:17:06,446 --> 00:17:07,880
she and the others were stealing.

305
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:09,348
That's what Peabody said.

306
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,284
I figured that was why Mooney
was trying to find her.

307
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:12,852
See if she could fix her.

308
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,887
Well...

309
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:16,589
it appears something went wrong.

310
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:18,690
This is Ethel Peabody.

311
00:17:21,495 --> 00:17:22,862
You're sure?

312
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,031
Two separate tests confirmed it.

313
00:17:25,098 --> 00:17:26,999
You remember there was a body

314
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:28,568
at the pharmaceuticals warehouse,

315
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:30,236
a worker ID'd

316
00:17:30,304 --> 00:17:32,872
as 35 years old but
who looked a hundred?

317
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,640
I remember.

318
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:38,344
So, Mooney kidnaps Peabody,

319
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:41,280
and then has one of
her creatures kill her.

320
00:17:41,348 --> 00:17:42,348
Why?

321
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,050
Did Peabody give her what she wanted?

322
00:17:44,117 --> 00:17:45,117
She no longer needed her?

323
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:46,719
It seems unlikely.

324
00:17:46,787 --> 00:17:50,156
My bet, Peabody simply couldn't fix her.

325
00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:53,960
Leaving Mooney still
searching for the cure.

326
00:17:54,027 --> 00:17:55,595
You're thinking what I'm thinking.

327
00:17:55,662 --> 00:17:58,598
There's only one person in
Gotham who could help her.

328
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:00,566
Hugo Strange.

329
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:11,365
Detective Bullock.

330
00:18:12,979 --> 00:18:14,459
Yeah, that's me.

331
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:16,385
Fish Mooney wants to see you.

332
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,848
All right, all right, all right!

333
00:18:21,873 --> 00:18:23,166
I'm going.

334
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:35,686
Hello, Harvey.

335
00:18:35,753 --> 00:18:36,920
Long time.

336
00:18:36,988 --> 00:18:38,255
Hey, Fish.

337
00:18:38,323 --> 00:18:39,723
How you doing?

338
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,192
- Not so good.
- Sorry to hear that.

339
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,221
You know, there's a lot of
people out there looking for you.

340
00:18:45,277 --> 00:18:46,530
Yeah.

341
00:18:46,597 --> 00:18:48,832
I need to find that bastard, Strange.

342
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,704
Yeah, well, you know I
can't help you with that.

343
00:18:53,771 --> 00:18:56,039
Oh.

344
00:18:56,107 --> 00:18:58,275
Yes, you can.

345
00:18:59,344 --> 00:19:03,287
And... you will.

346
00:19:15,512 --> 00:19:17,290
I'll help you find Strange.

347
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,643
Good boy.

348
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:32,116
This is it.

349
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:34,153
Nothing special, but it's home.

350
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:36,687
You hungry?

351
00:19:36,754 --> 00:19:38,488
Just thirsty.

352
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:39,656
Beer?

353
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:40,657
Pop?

354
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:41,966
Tea?

355
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:43,411
Water.

356
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:54,455
So sad.

357
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:56,190
Poor things.

358
00:19:56,224 --> 00:19:58,225
My ex-wife left a box of
clothes when she moved out.

359
00:19:58,293 --> 00:19:59,893
You're welcome to them,
if you want to change.

360
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:02,748
Okay.

361
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:04,665
So, where are you from?

362
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:06,934
Gotham.

363
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:11,872
Listen, if you need to
use the phone, go ahead.

364
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,861
Why would I need to use the phone?

365
00:20:13,884 --> 00:20:15,409
Someone's got to be looking for you.

366
00:20:15,477 --> 00:20:16,617
No.

367
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:19,947
- No one.
- Really?

368
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:21,181
A beautiful girl like you?

369
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:24,943
You think I'm beautiful?

370
00:20:27,656 --> 00:20:29,488
So, who are you?

371
00:20:31,626 --> 00:20:33,468
Just a girl.

372
00:20:34,396 --> 00:20:36,430
Cops killed my dad.

373
00:20:36,498 --> 00:20:38,298
My mom left.

374
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:40,434
I was alone.

375
00:20:40,502 --> 00:20:41,996
Abandoned.

376
00:20:43,672 --> 00:20:45,839
But then...

377
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,842
something happened and...

378
00:20:50,645 --> 00:20:52,780
I changed.

379
00:20:54,115 --> 00:20:56,350
Grew.

380
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:58,118
I'm different...

381
00:21:00,522 --> 00:21:02,122
inside and out.

382
00:21:05,293 --> 00:21:07,327
So sad.

383
00:21:07,395 --> 00:21:09,396
I'm gonna get rid of that.

384
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:12,733
I've never been that good
at taking care of things.

385
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:14,869
What are you doing?

386
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:18,338
Relax. They're just plants.

387
00:21:18,406 --> 00:21:20,174
I'll get those clothes.

388
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:28,182
You don't know that Mooney has him,

389
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:30,217
or that she's looking for Strange,

390
00:21:30,285 --> 00:21:31,351
and, again,

391
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:32,953
you shouldn't even be here.

392
00:21:33,021 --> 00:21:34,421
Harvey isn't answering his phone.

393
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:35,322
Nobody knows where he is.

394
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,724
Well, you could start by looking

395
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,926
in every place in Gotham
that serves booze.

396
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:41,595
And we found this...

397
00:21:41,663 --> 00:21:43,931
beside his car.

398
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,811
She's looking for him.

399
00:21:49,924 --> 00:21:51,472
With Peabody dead,

400
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:52,539
that'd be her next logical step.

401
00:21:52,607 --> 00:21:53,707
Damn.

402
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:55,309
Damn, damn!

403
00:21:55,376 --> 00:21:56,510
You have to call someone.

404
00:21:56,578 --> 00:21:57,911
Tell them Fish is on her way.

405
00:21:57,979 --> 00:22:00,114
Call who? The Feds?

406
00:22:00,181 --> 00:22:02,416
I don't even know which
department has Strange.

407
00:22:02,484 --> 00:22:04,485
But you do know where they're
hiding him, don't you?

408
00:22:04,552 --> 00:22:06,009
You and Bullock both know.

409
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:10,424
They took him to a
place outside the city.

410
00:22:10,492 --> 00:22:12,960
It's like an old mansion,

411
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:14,461
but on the inside, it's a
high-tech research facility.

412
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:17,197
The government has scientists
debriefing him, don't they?

413
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:20,534
They want to know what he
discovered in Indian Hill.

414
00:22:20,602 --> 00:22:21,635
You have to tell us where it is.

415
00:22:21,703 --> 00:22:23,482
The hell I do.

416
00:22:25,373 --> 00:22:26,673
I'll take you there.

417
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:38,986
Are you sure this is the place?

418
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:41,955
Yeah. This is where I dropped
Strange off a few months ago.

419
00:22:43,358 --> 00:22:45,692
All right, show time.

420
00:22:55,204 --> 00:22:57,171
Hey, fellas.

421
00:22:57,238 --> 00:22:58,772
At ease, soldiers.

422
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,574
Detective Bullock, GCPD.

423
00:23:00,642 --> 00:23:03,343
- Where's your badge?
- My badge?

424
00:23:03,411 --> 00:23:05,145
Oh, man, I must've dropped it.

425
00:23:05,213 --> 00:23:06,346
I'm here to see Strange.

426
00:23:06,414 --> 00:23:07,414
We haven't heard anything.

427
00:23:07,482 --> 00:23:08,982
You haven't? That's strange.

428
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,450
I mean strange weird,
not the guy Strange.

429
00:23:10,518 --> 00:23:11,919
Do you have ID?

430
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:14,354
Yeah.

431
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:19,526
- Um...
- Who the hell...?

432
00:23:19,594 --> 00:23:20,627
Hold it!

433
00:23:20,695 --> 00:23:23,476
I said hold it!

434
00:23:52,493 --> 00:23:53,393
Stop right...

435
00:24:20,221 --> 00:24:22,222
Professor Strange.

436
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:26,293
You and I have some unfinished business.

437
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:36,075
Look at you.

438
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:38,509
Amazing.

439
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:42,762
You were my greatest creation.

440
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:45,675
Your greatest creation who's dying.

441
00:24:46,488 --> 00:24:48,022
What?

442
00:24:51,684 --> 00:24:54,574
You're going to fix me, Daddy.

443
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,964
And when that's done,

444
00:24:57,032 --> 00:24:59,500
you're going to make me an army,

445
00:24:59,568 --> 00:25:04,038
so I can have this city
kneeling at my feet.

446
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,294
But I can't...

447
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:09,877
fix you.

448
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,049
Fish, cops. Lots of them.

449
00:25:15,117 --> 00:25:18,219
You have a few minutes
to rethink your answer.

450
00:25:18,287 --> 00:25:20,706
I'd suggest you do.

451
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:47,481
It's Bullock.

452
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,352
Harvey. Harvey, you all right?

453
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,087
Oh, he's fine.

454
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:54,922
But this ain't Harvey.

455
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,857
I want to talk to him.

456
00:25:56,925 --> 00:25:58,593
Sure.

457
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,628
- You don't control me anymore.
- Sid.

458
00:26:02,864 --> 00:26:05,533
Hey, Cap. How are ya? Sorry.

459
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:07,668
One chance, Mooney.

460
00:26:07,736 --> 00:26:10,871
You let him go, you might
just make it out of this.

461
00:26:10,939 --> 00:26:12,206
Chump.

462
00:26:12,274 --> 00:26:14,275
Don't you know you're
speaking to a dying woman,

463
00:26:14,343 --> 00:26:17,144
which severely limits
your negotiating position?

464
00:26:17,212 --> 00:26:19,780
So here's how it's going to go down.

465
00:26:19,848 --> 00:26:21,749
One cop comes within 20 feet

466
00:26:21,817 --> 00:26:23,551
of this place, and Harvey,

467
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:27,254
although I love him, will eat a bullet.

468
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:31,225
You had to come back, didn't you?

469
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:33,494
Like a bad penny.

470
00:26:33,562 --> 00:26:34,762
Now where were we?

471
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,964
Fish, you got to give it
up; you're surrounded.

472
00:26:37,032 --> 00:26:38,132
You got nowhere to go!

473
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,500
Shut up, Harvey.

474
00:26:40,435 --> 00:26:41,769
What's going on?

475
00:26:41,837 --> 00:26:43,648
- How's Bullock?
- Listen up!

476
00:26:44,172 --> 00:26:46,140
I want you to create a full perimeter.

477
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:47,842
Snipers on every corner.

478
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:49,377
Mooney does not make it out of this.

479
00:26:49,444 --> 00:26:50,244
Understood?

480
00:26:50,312 --> 00:26:52,179
- Yes, sir.
- Now go.

481
00:26:52,247 --> 00:26:53,514
- Captain.
- What?

482
00:26:53,582 --> 00:26:54,949
You cannot just leave him in there.

483
00:26:55,017 --> 00:26:56,350
You think that's what I'm doing?

484
00:26:56,418 --> 00:26:58,052
I'm just not charging
through the front door

485
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,153
so he gets killed.

486
00:26:59,221 --> 00:27:00,321
And I'll remind you,

487
00:27:00,389 --> 00:27:02,189
you are no longer a police officer.

488
00:27:02,257 --> 00:27:05,092
Get in my way, and
I'll have you arrested.

489
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:12,600
Oh, no, not the press.

490
00:27:12,668 --> 00:27:14,301
Keep the press back.

491
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:17,104
Keep them back.

492
00:27:24,246 --> 00:27:28,282
We are standing outside the
mansion and preliminary reports

493
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,217
are that wanted Indian
Hill escapee Fish Mooney

494
00:27:30,285 --> 00:27:34,055
has barricaded herself inside
and is holding a hostage.

495
00:27:34,122 --> 00:27:36,057
This is it, Butch.

496
00:27:36,124 --> 00:27:38,426
She's finally cornered.

497
00:27:38,493 --> 00:27:40,327
Like a rat.

498
00:27:40,395 --> 00:27:42,029
Yeah, but what are you gonna do?

499
00:27:42,097 --> 00:27:44,065
The cops are already there.

500
00:27:50,572 --> 00:27:52,973
The GCPD is not Gotham.

501
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:55,142
Gotham listens to me.

502
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:59,447
It's time to round up our friends.

503
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:03,350
Believe me, if I could fix you, I would.

504
00:28:03,418 --> 00:28:05,720
I think of you as one
of my own children.

505
00:28:05,787 --> 00:28:07,321
But I can't.

506
00:28:07,389 --> 00:28:09,490
So what am I supposed to do?

507
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:10,558
Give up?

508
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:13,661
Do you not understand what you are?

509
00:28:13,729 --> 00:28:15,062
What you represent?

510
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,970
You are the first of a new generation.

511
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:21,202
A new Eve.

512
00:28:24,706 --> 00:28:27,441
You know, I owned a club once.

513
00:28:28,343 --> 00:28:31,445
Ran protection on the side.

514
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:34,548
Every first of the month,
people would pay me.

515
00:28:34,616 --> 00:28:36,951
Every once in a while,
someone would come up short.

516
00:28:37,018 --> 00:28:38,252
And they'd say,

517
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,555
"Mooney, I don't have the money.

518
00:28:41,623 --> 00:28:43,924
Mooney, I need more time."

519
00:28:43,992 --> 00:28:46,460
And they'd cry and cry.

520
00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:51,065
And then I discovered
that when I squeezed them,

521
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:53,934
and squeezed them,

522
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:56,771
and squeezed them,

523
00:28:56,838 --> 00:29:00,608
they always had more.

524
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:05,546
You are going to fix me...

525
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:10,050
or I swear to God, I will make you pray

526
00:29:10,118 --> 00:29:11,585
for your death.

527
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:14,522
Fish.

528
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:17,458
What are the cops doing now?

529
00:29:17,526 --> 00:29:19,126
It's not the cops.

530
00:29:22,063 --> 00:29:24,365
What the hell is this?

531
00:29:34,376 --> 00:29:36,043
Cordon off this entire area.

532
00:29:36,111 --> 00:29:37,773
No one gets near the house.

533
00:29:41,082 --> 00:29:42,216
Cobblepot,

534
00:29:42,284 --> 00:29:43,684
what the hell are you doing here?

535
00:29:43,752 --> 00:29:45,186
What you have proven to be incapable of

536
00:29:45,253 --> 00:29:46,620
time and time again.

537
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:48,489
This is a GCPD operation.

538
00:29:48,557 --> 00:29:51,859
I am ordering you and
this mob to disperse.

539
00:29:51,927 --> 00:29:53,961
- Immediately.
- Fat chance.

540
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:56,864
I will not let those
monsters escape again.

541
00:29:56,932 --> 00:29:58,833
Fish Mooney dies tonight!

542
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,000
Yeah!

543
00:30:00,068 --> 00:30:01,468
Dammit, Cobblepot.

544
00:30:01,536 --> 00:30:04,071
One of my detectives is inside.

545
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:05,539
This is the last time I'm gonna ask.

546
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:06,640
Back up!

547
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,175
You've had your chance, Barnes.

548
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,211
Now it's my turn.

549
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:12,046
Who's with me?

550
00:30:13,949 --> 00:30:14,949
Stay back!

551
00:30:56,324 --> 00:30:59,489
You killed a lot of our friends, Gordon.

552
00:31:01,062 --> 00:31:02,809
A lot of your friends had it coming.

553
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,066
So do you.

554
00:31:06,902 --> 00:31:08,369
That's enough.

555
00:31:09,437 --> 00:31:11,105
Bring him in.

556
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,266
Kill them now!

557
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:20,557
Stay back!

558
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:24,495
Jim, what the hell are you doing here?

559
00:31:24,562 --> 00:31:26,430
Saving you; I thought that was obvious.

560
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:28,265
Oh, yeah. Totally. Thank you.

561
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:30,100
Why are you here, Gordon?

562
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:31,668
Did your little cop friend send you

563
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:33,437
to get me to turn myself in?

564
00:31:33,505 --> 00:31:35,739
'Cause that's not going to happen.

565
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:37,241
I'm here on my own.

566
00:31:37,308 --> 00:31:38,642
I only want Bullock.

567
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,810
Really?

568
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:40,911
You'd risk your life

569
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:42,613
for this broken down old thing?

570
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,881
Thanks.

571
00:31:45,216 --> 00:31:46,216
He'd do the same for me.

572
00:31:46,284 --> 00:31:47,451
I would, it's true.

573
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,620
Well, you've helped me,

574
00:31:49,687 --> 00:31:51,588
'cause now I have two hostages.

575
00:31:51,656 --> 00:31:53,657
Barnes won't see it that way.

576
00:31:53,725 --> 00:31:56,326
Hell, you kill me, he'll
probably thank you.

577
00:31:56,394 --> 00:31:58,662
I've been nothing but a
pain in the ass to him.

578
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,763
Also true.

579
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:05,989
Then you better give me one good reason

580
00:32:07,104 --> 00:32:09,907
why I shouldn't have
my friends kill you.

581
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,478
Because I can get you out of here.

582
00:32:14,546 --> 00:32:16,480
And exactly how do you plan to do that,

583
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:18,949
considering this whole
place is surrounded?

584
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:20,517
That's my problem.

585
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:22,286
I get you out of here,
you give me Bullock.

586
00:32:22,353 --> 00:32:23,520
That's the deal.

587
00:32:28,293 --> 00:32:30,127
I get this one.

588
00:32:31,162 --> 00:32:33,442
- Wait a second...
- Deal.

589
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,735
You have two minutes.

590
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,817
Jim, you just keep surprising me.

591
00:32:53,885 --> 00:32:57,854
Shut up. How'd you like to
have Fish all to yourself?

592
00:32:57,922 --> 00:32:59,690
Don't tease.

593
00:33:00,153 --> 00:33:03,427
She'll be in the woods behind
the mansion in five minutes.

594
00:33:03,494 --> 00:33:05,696
All you have to do is one thing.

595
00:33:05,763 --> 00:33:07,110
Name it.

596
00:33:12,303 --> 00:33:14,871
Cobblepot, get this crowd to disperse,

597
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:17,741
or I'll make them disperse.
And there will be bloodshed.

598
00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:19,743
Promise?!

599
00:33:20,745 --> 00:33:21,845
People of Gotham!

600
00:33:21,913 --> 00:33:23,680
The time for action is now!

601
00:33:24,716 --> 00:33:25,616
Kill the monsters!

602
00:33:25,683 --> 00:33:27,584
Kill them now!

603
00:33:29,687 --> 00:33:31,955
We need all units to the front
of the house immediately!

604
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:41,665
The mob's broken through the front,

605
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:43,600
but the back is clear. We
can make it to the woods.

606
00:33:43,668 --> 00:33:47,104
Time to go. You two hold
'em off as long as you can.

607
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:48,739
And, Harvey, no hard feelings.

608
00:33:48,806 --> 00:33:51,408
Fish, screw you.

609
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:53,410
Fair enough. Jim,

610
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:55,746
- you can't let her take me.
- Good-bye, Professor.

611
00:33:55,813 --> 00:33:56,813
She's going to kill me.

612
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:58,949
She's gonna kill me!

613
00:33:59,017 --> 00:34:00,851
Stop!

614
00:34:35,386 --> 00:34:37,387
Go!

615
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:44,027
That's better.

616
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:45,929
Just old friends.

617
00:34:45,997 --> 00:34:48,131
- Oswald...
- Don't call me that!

618
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,866
My name is Penguin.

619
00:34:51,345 --> 00:34:53,670
Do you know how long I've
been looking for you?

620
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:55,706
How long I've waited
for this very moment?

621
00:34:55,773 --> 00:34:56,840
Mr. Cobblepot...

622
00:34:56,908 --> 00:34:59,376
- Quiet!
- So this is it?

623
00:34:59,444 --> 00:35:01,845
I spare your life,

624
00:35:01,913 --> 00:35:05,382
and you shoot me dead in
the woods like an animal?

625
00:35:07,325 --> 00:35:08,852
Pretty much, yes.

626
00:35:10,188 --> 00:35:12,789
But I will admit,

627
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:15,904
that night under the
bridge stayed with me.

628
00:35:16,794 --> 00:35:18,095
Why?

629
00:35:18,162 --> 00:35:21,865
- Why what?
- Why didn't you kill me?

630
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:25,135
I have gone over that night 1,000 times,

631
00:35:25,203 --> 00:35:27,160
and it doesn't make any sense.

632
00:35:28,473 --> 00:35:29,806
Why didn't you kill me?

633
00:35:29,874 --> 00:35:32,362
I would've killed you in an instant.

634
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,869
- Answer me!
- Because you're mine.

635
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:42,463
You were my umbrella boy, remember?

636
00:35:43,187 --> 00:35:45,088
You rubbed my feet

637
00:35:45,156 --> 00:35:47,090
when they were tired.

638
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:49,760
And now look at you,

639
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:52,429
the terror of Gotham.

640
00:35:54,603 --> 00:35:57,167
Everything I've done in my life,

641
00:35:57,235 --> 00:36:00,737
possibly the best thing

642
00:36:00,805 --> 00:36:02,272
was turning

643
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,709
Oswald Cobblepot into...

644
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:07,948
the Penguin.

645
00:36:09,046 --> 00:36:11,794
I couldn't destroy that.

646
00:36:15,153 --> 00:36:17,020
Ask him.

647
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:18,789
He understands

648
00:36:18,856 --> 00:36:22,826
what it is to bring
something into being.

649
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:25,605
It is a part of you.

650
00:36:26,497 --> 00:36:28,865
Forever.

651
00:36:38,762 --> 00:36:40,444
Good-bye, Fish.

652
00:36:41,813 --> 00:36:44,114
Don't come back.

653
00:37:03,328 --> 00:37:05,562
Got some more fuel for the fire!

654
00:37:31,122 --> 00:37:33,090
Penguin! Penguin!

655
00:37:33,157 --> 00:37:35,158
Penguin! Penguin!

656
00:37:35,226 --> 00:37:36,994
Penguin! Penguin!

657
00:37:37,061 --> 00:37:39,529
Penguin! Penguin!

658
00:37:39,597 --> 00:37:40,897
Penguin!

659
00:37:45,403 --> 00:37:48,071
Tell Barnes something, would you?

660
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:50,173
I'm going home.

661
00:38:20,171 --> 00:38:22,406
Next time,

662
00:38:22,473 --> 00:38:24,611
remember to water.

663
00:38:31,115 --> 00:38:32,516
Well, I, for one,

664
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:34,217
am personally very
glad not to be staring

665
00:38:34,285 --> 00:38:36,787
at those bloody box files and
that flaming bulletin board,

666
00:38:36,854 --> 00:38:39,273
tramping down those
stairs to that dank cave.

667
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:43,993
It does leave one question
unanswered though, doesn't it,

668
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:45,675
- Master Bruce?
- What's that?

669
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:49,099
Well, you know, with all this
spare time on your hands,

670
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:50,591
how are you gonna fill it?

671
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:54,143
Well, I imagine you have some ideas.

672
00:38:54,222 --> 00:38:55,475
I do.

673
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:59,443
Dancing lessons.

674
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:02,301
Dancing lessons.

675
00:39:02,346 --> 00:39:04,848
That's right. I mean, a man
of your station should be able

676
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:07,517
to guide gracefully a
beautiful young girl

677
00:39:07,585 --> 00:39:09,286
across a dance floor, don't you think?

678
00:39:09,353 --> 00:39:11,922
And I suppose that you're gonna
be teaching me these lessons.

679
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:14,591
Why, I certainly could. You
know, I was quite well regarded

680
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:17,666
as a... bit of a dancer
in my day, actually.

681
00:39:17,711 --> 00:39:18,907
Were you?

682
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:20,430
But I think I'll leave
that particular ordeal

683
00:39:20,498 --> 00:39:22,250
to someone more qualified.

684
00:39:37,815 --> 00:39:39,983
Right.

685
00:39:40,051 --> 00:39:42,119
Step out.

686
00:39:42,186 --> 00:39:43,448
Slowly.

687
00:39:51,029 --> 00:39:52,236
Who are you?

688
00:40:04,342 --> 00:40:06,098
Oh, my word.

689
00:40:06,584 --> 00:40:08,480
Please don't hurt me.

690
00:40:19,824 --> 00:40:21,825
You don't quit, do you?

691
00:40:21,893 --> 00:40:24,094
I came by to let you know
that tomorrow's paper

692
00:40:24,162 --> 00:40:26,997
is gonna lay out Bullock's
story of how Fish got away.

693
00:40:27,064 --> 00:40:30,600
How she just... vanished
while you two were escaping.

694
00:40:30,668 --> 00:40:32,525
Great. Can't wait to read about it.

695
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,925
And it's a load of crap.

696
00:40:34,794 --> 00:40:36,506
You want to know what I think?

697
00:40:36,574 --> 00:40:38,408
I got the feeling you're
gonna tell me either way.

698
00:40:38,476 --> 00:40:41,011
I think you made a deal with Fish.

699
00:40:41,078 --> 00:40:44,347
You let her escape with Strange
in exchange for Bullock's life.

700
00:40:51,522 --> 00:40:53,456
And how would I manage that?

701
00:40:53,524 --> 00:40:56,860
I saw Penguin get a call
before the riot started.

702
00:40:56,928 --> 00:40:58,461
When the mob attacked,

703
00:40:58,529 --> 00:41:00,897
Barnes ordered all
the cops to the front.

704
00:41:00,965 --> 00:41:05,300
And that's when Fish slipped
into the woods with Strange.

705
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,871
By that logic, Penguin

706
00:41:07,939 --> 00:41:09,773
helped Fish escape.
Why would he do that?

707
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,410
'Cause he wanted Fish all to himself.

708
00:41:11,444 --> 00:41:13,340
I mean, that is what you
offered him, wasn't it?

709
00:41:14,729 --> 00:41:17,747
You promised to help Fish
escape, but you did it

710
00:41:17,815 --> 00:41:20,550
by double-crossing her and
delivering her to Penguin.

711
00:41:20,618 --> 00:41:23,373
If that were so, I'd be
a millionaire by now.

712
00:41:23,892 --> 00:41:26,189
Except Fish isn't dead.

713
00:41:26,816 --> 00:41:29,706
Penguin would've dragged her
in front of the mob if she was.

714
00:41:34,065 --> 00:41:36,046
So what happened in the woods?

715
00:41:37,675 --> 00:41:39,221
I don't know.

716
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:43,281
I do know

717
00:41:43,947 --> 00:41:46,987
that you're gonna have a hard
time collecting all that cash.

718
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:50,614
'Course, that wasn't why
you did any of this, was it?

719
00:41:52,483 --> 00:41:55,270
Who the hell are you, Jim Gordon?

720
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,568
- Wait...
- Shut up for once.
