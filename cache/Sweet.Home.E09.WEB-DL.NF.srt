ORIGINAL STORY <i>SWEET HOME</i>
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

3
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,462
You died when you should have lived,

4
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,592
and I lived when I should have died.

5
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,265
<i>I'm scared</i>

6
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,308
<i>and nervous.</i>

7
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,482
I know it's crazy to say
something like this in this situation,

8
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,948
but I think I should say it.

9
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,787
I like you, Ji-su.

10
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,665
Is that

11
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,626
God's will, too?

12
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:50,962
No.

13
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,464
It's my will.

14
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,019
Here.

15
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,066
You were always ugly,
but you look way uglier now.

16
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,654
You want to live, right?

17
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,615
Just act like before.

18
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,826
Nothing good will happen
if you're near me.

19
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,997
Get away from me if you want to live.

20
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,667
My bad luck will rub off on you.

21
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,460
Jeez.

22
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,006
You really hate yourself, don't you?

23
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,386
Everyone around me dies.

24
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,306
Whether they kill themselves…

25
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,810
or get killed by monsters…

26
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,270
Are you throwing a pity party?

27
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,154
Well, I have really bad luck too.

28
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,827
You know I'm an orphan, right?

29
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,874
My family went to see
a ballet performance one day,

30
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,753
and we got into an accident.

31
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,466
So both my mom and dad…

32
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,431
My dad said he was tired,
but I was stubborn about going there.

33
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,853
I made Eun-hyeok become an orphan, too.

34
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,232
And I ruined Eun-hyeok's life.

35
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,987
We're not blood-related at all.

36
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,282
And honestly, we're not even family
without our parents.

37
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,828
But he took a leave from school
to help me study ballet.

38
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,791
He's crazy. He's really crazy.

39
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,671
He said it wasn't my fault.

40
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,715
He said it's okay.

41
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,094
Does he think I'll be okay with it
just because he is?

42
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,931
I didn't want to be indebted to him,

43
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,728
so I was determined to become a successful
ballerina to pay him back later, but…

44
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,021
Damn it.

45
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,940
My ankle's so ruined
I can't even do a turn.

46
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,116
What do you think?

47
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,577
Am I pitiful?

48
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,584
You seem to think
your life is most pitiful,

49
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,503
but it's not.

50
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,630
I'll prove it to you.

51
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,217
I'm going to survive with you
until the end.

52
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,306
I had nothing else to do anyway.

53
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,996
Don't try to make yourself miserable.

54
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,958
Things are bad enough already.

55
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,635
<i>It's been about 30 years.</i>

56
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,513
<i>I grabbed a knife</i>
<i>at my first birthday ceremony.</i>

57
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,067
JUNG JAE-HEON

58
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,499
Jung Jae-heon…

59
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,638
Drink as much as you want.

60
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,353
Just five more days.

61
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,942
I endured 30 hard years.

62
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,779
Five days is nothing.

63
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,808
We should find him.

64
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,603
Burn them.

65
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,881
Let me ask you a favor.

66
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,635
There's something inside this building.

67
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,513
-We must find it.
-Find what?

68
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:02,560
I don't know. An underground tunnel
or a bunker or something.

69
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,437
What do you plan to do?

70
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,396
Hide.

71
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,024
More people will die
if we keep fighting the monsters.

72
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,444
Young people who have their whole lives
ahead of them are dying out.

73
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,949
I believe that you'll survive this.

74
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,743
I can tell from your face.

75
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,875
Grandpa, look.

76
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,368
Is the army coming to rescue us?

77
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,994
Are they?

78
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,250
Move on your own.

79
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,712
-I'll greet the guests.
-What?

80
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,967
You can't trust soldiers
in such situations.

81
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,969
I guess you might not know.

82
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,138
I know it, too.

83
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,601
You have a junior colleague now.

84
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,271
She's going to be a secret agent, too.

85
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,499
It's coming this way!

86
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,460
Damn it, this is bad. It's coming!

87
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,544
Have you been well?

88
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,636
-Hold him.
-Help!

89
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,765
-Stop!
-Okay, one, two…

90
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,315
It's not opening.

91
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,733
We failed again?

92
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,583
Find everyone who's hiding.

93
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,567
It'll be easier to just shoot them.

94
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,696
You always talk about killing everyone.
We should have fun with them.

95
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,406
A robbery in the middle of the day?

96
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,038
Didn't your mother buy you any paper?

97
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,874
Why the hell did you scribble
on your face?

98
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,128
You stupid old geezer.

99
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,881
You've lived enough.
Why are you still alive?

100
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,467
-It's not even a good world to live in.
-Goodness.

101
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,428
What kind of losers just intruded and--

102
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,268
Say one more word,

103
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,019
and I'll tear your jaw off.

104
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,812
<i>Your mission</i>

105
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,148
<i>is to stay hidden.</i>

106
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,608
You have to stay in there.

107
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,526
Don't ever get caught.

108
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,194
You can do that, right?

109
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,946
But…

110
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,077
What about Yeong-su? Where is--

111
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,289
It's okay. Everything will be fine.

112
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,310
I think it's a bit bigger than last time.

113
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,312
Should I measure the area every time?

114
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,690
This is your jail now.

115
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,366
-No!
-Ji-eun!

116
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,451
I'm scared.

117
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,793
-Oh, my legs hurt.
-Mr. Han…

118
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,295
Mr. Han.

119
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,262
No, Mr. Han! You'll be killed, too!

120
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,264
What do you think you're doing?

121
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,432
Come and take her.

122
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,324
How could you kill her?

123
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,327
People's lives are useless these days.

124
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,759
You're so emotional.

125
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,303
Are you going to cry
over every person's death?

126
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,932
Mister, you crossed the line. Go inside.

127
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,350
Mr. Han!

128
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,064
You can all live harmoniously in there.
You just have

129
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,732
a little less room than before.

130
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,198
Damn, they started already.

131
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,991
I missed the good part.

132
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:11,882
Jeez.

133
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,135
Hey.

134
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,471
Where are you going?

135
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,057
You stink right now. A lot.

136
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,683
You shit…

137
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,890
It's a girl.

138
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,642
A girl.

139
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,651
She's hurt.

140
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,348
That's enough.

141
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,271
Get lost.

142
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,529
Jung-seop is looking for you.

143
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,573
Stop calling him by his name, you shit!

144
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,120
It's really not the time to do that.

145
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,581
You could be killed

146
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,875
by Jung-seop.

147
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,036
I'm Shin Jung-seop.

148
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,122
Let's all get along without fighting.

149
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,000
How can you say that after what you did?

150
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,380
How can you treat people like this?
Do you think we're beasts?

151
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,382
This is all I've seen and learned.

152
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,759
If you all do as I say,

153
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,928
I won't kill anyone else.

154
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,597
So?

155
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,852
What are you planning to do?

156
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,400
We should get to know each other.

157
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,111
I bet you're curious about us, too.

158
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,824
Then tell us.

159
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,495
Where were you before coming here?

160
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,791
What happened there?

161
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,171
They all died.

162
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,007
Did they die?

163
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,551
Or did you kill them?

164
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,148
<i>It was a small church.</i>

165
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,735
<i>They'd had it fortified well,</i>
<i>so I got my hopes up,</i>

166
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,112
<i>but all of them were already dead.</i>

167
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,658
<i>What's interesting is</i>

168
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,537
that there weren't any signs
of a monster being there.

169
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,166
They had all killed each other.

170
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,424
It's not the time to be worrying
about monsters.

171
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,055
Humans…

172
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,891
are the scariest.

173
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,484
What is it?

174
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,736
What?

175
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,738
Ui-myeong said you were looking for me.

176
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,327
What? No, I wasn't.

177
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,162
You son of a bitch!

178
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,166
Did you find anything?

179
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,755
A girl.

180
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:03,840
She's hurt.

181
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,012
Hey, stop frowning.

182
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,223
These people are already scared.

183
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,817
You just left her alone?

184
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,652
Why? Was she not your type?

185
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,570
Should I kill her?

186
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,864
Don't touch her. I'm saving her for later.

187
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,710
Are you crazy? Stop standing up to them.

188
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,004
Do you want to get yourself killed?

189
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,798
I did it because I wanted to live.

190
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,885
-We have to wait.
-Until when?

191
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:55,225
It seems they're criminals who killed
soldiers and stole their weapons.

192
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,186
And they only have a few guns

193
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,564
when there are dozens
of monsters out there.

194
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,816
But we can't just do nothing.

195
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,652
There will be an opportunity.

196
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,195
I'm sure of it.

197
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,493
<i>You're not the only weapon we have.</i>

198
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,243
SAFETY ON

199
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,162
Hey.

200
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,706
You don't know how to use that, do you?

201
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,047
No, I didn't serve in the military.

202
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,256
You asshole…

203
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,365
You said you were a firefighter.

204
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,325
I used to be in the special forces.

205
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,369
How did you find the rifle?

206
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,162
I saw you hiding it.

207
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,512
You really made an effort.

208
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,558
Who's the leader here?

209
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,021
Who made this?

210
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,277
I did.

211
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,614
I heard someone even performed
surgery in here. Who did that?

212
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,032
I did.

213
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,203
Everyone here is completely useless.

214
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,289
There's an old man and a cripple,

215
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,748
and even a patient.

216
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,168
This place is the worst so far,
but quite a lot of people survived here.

217
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,880
You're young,
but I guess you're pretty capable.

218
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,348
I like you. What do you say?

219
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,934
Will you abandon them and join me?

220
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:46,855
Or will you…

221
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,858
just die?

222
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:03,830
Hey…

223
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,417
What…

224
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,180
You made a good choice.

225
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,765
You're pretty smart.

226
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,224
Sir!

227
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,560
There's a monster here.

228
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,323
Yi-kyung.

229
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,662
Mister.

230
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:49,876
Come here.

231
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,132
Why did you go in there?

232
00:27:56,216 --> 00:28:00,220
Well, my mission was to hide,

233
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,389
but I saw Yi-kyung.

234
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,850
She's a secret agent, too…

235
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:10,980
and Grandpa wasn't coming. I was scared.

236
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,653
Don't!

237
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,281
It saved me!

238
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,646
<i>She might not be dangerous.</i>

239
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,148
She's still human.

240
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,066
-There are monsters that don't harm--
-So?

241
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,946
She's going to be a monster anyway.

242
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,115
But…

243
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,242
You locked her up because you were scared.

244
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,120
You're such a hypocrite.

245
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,708
I thought you were pretty smart,
but you're just a kid.

246
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,008
I'm Shin Jung-seop.

247
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,844
I want you to know
that it's nothing personal.

248
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,057
Do you have any final words to say?

249
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,435
-You asshole!
-Hey!

250
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,562
Oh, come on.

251
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:37,192
You're the toughest
among all the losers here.

252
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,449
Watch and learn.

253
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:52,373
What just happened? Who…

254
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,584
Did they kill Eun-hyeok?

255
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,128
He's on their side now.
So it must be Seon-yeong.

256
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,380
<i>They're different from you.</i>

257
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,800
<i>They could all get killed.</i>

258
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,010
Hyun-su…

259
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,350
<i>There will be an opportunity.</i>

260
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,060
<i>I'm sure of it.</i>

261
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,784
What are you waiting for?

262
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,078
You're a doctor.
You should declare her dead.

263
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,542
Hypocrisy comes at a huge cost.

264
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,396
If we hesitate any longer,
more people will die.

265
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,940
What's your plan?

266
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,403
You don't know how to use a gun,

267
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,448
but are you good at getting away?

268
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,744
I've usually been the one chasing.

269
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,538
You must be good at it now

270
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,832
because you're not alone.

271
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,967
"I'll get things cleaned up first,
Jung-seop."

272
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,719
He's pretending to be so nice.

273
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,180
Why doesn't he just hold a funeral
for her while he's at it?

274
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:16,142
Sir, I'm telling you, Ui-myeong
really doesn't suit our group.

275
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:23,816
Get her!

276
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,865
GREEN SUPERMARKET

277
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,830
What was that?

278
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,958
Cha Hyun-su! Now!

279
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,543
Come on!

280
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,341
Wait!

281
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,647
Close your eyes.

282
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,776
Not you, you shit!

283
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,478
-Get him!
-Get him!

284
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,157
Everyone, stop!

285
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,559
Let them go

286
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,520
before I blow his brains out.

287
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,034
Sir.

288
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,371
Sir.

289
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,390
No, Ms. An…

290
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,204
I'm sorry…

291
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,732
You're keeping something strange.

292
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,736
Sir, he'll recover soon.

293
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:38,988
We should kill

294
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,240
every monster.

295
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,743
Jeez.

296
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,730
She's really going to die this time.

297
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,732
Shut up, you idiot.

298
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,236
Where the hell have you been?

299
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,197
Shut your trap. Your breath stinks.

300
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:06,284
What? That son of a bitch…

301
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,205
You smell of disinfectant.

302
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,292
You'd better go over there.

303
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,961
The patient's in bad condition.

304
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,839
I think she might die soon.

305
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:24,885
No.

306
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,033
I'm hurt, too.
Do you want to see my wound?

307
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:03,466
You bitch.

308
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,807
What? Do you want to go first? Good.

309
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:11,700
Yu-ri…

310
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,525
Hurry.

311
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,535
I knew this would happen!

312
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,830
Drop your gun.

313
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,334
Should we make a bet on who can kill
more people?

314
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,547
The side that's more scared
should surrender!

315
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,715
Drop your gun.

316
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,634
Drop it, you bitch!

317
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,605
This is just the beginning, you bitch!

318
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,698
Damn it!

319
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,713
My goodness…

320
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:57,908
Wait here.

321
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,140
I…

322
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,353
killed a person.

323
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:29,773
It's okay.

324
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,407
He wasn't human.

325
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,004
Here.

326
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,133
Let's just burn him.

327
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,347
That's no fun.

328
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,437
Will he die if he falls from here?

329
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,898
No, wait.

330
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:12,941
Should I take out his intestines?

331
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,945
Or should I cut off his head
and keep it as a souvenir?

332
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,742
-There's no need…
-He's not human anyway.

333
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,161
Well, it doesn't matter even if he is.

334
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,921
Look at him struggling to live.

335
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,477
I won't let

336
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,230
any of you go downstairs.

337
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,441
I see.

338
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,359
You're pretty tough.

339
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,571
But you don't seem
to get the picture here.

340
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:44,199
I'll kill you slowly,
as many times as you want.

341
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,014
You crossed the line this time, Jung-seop.

342
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:35,834
Do you want that, too?

343
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:38,253
No, I don't…

344
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,005
I don't want that.

345
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,303
Thank you.

346
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,942
I like that look on your face.

347
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,110
It's nice to meet you.

348
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:28,262
{\an8}SPECIAL INFECTEE REPORT GUIDE

349
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:44,862
It must hurt.

350
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,572
I know how it feels.

351
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,867
You can never get used to it.

352
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,160
Why did you kill him?

353
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,121
I thought you'd be grateful.

354
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,497
You were on the same side.

355
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:02,588
How can a wolf and a rabbit
be on the same side?

356
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,424
The rabbit was pretending to be
a wolf, so I just played along.

357
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,598
But there's no need for that now.

358
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,518
It's not a crime for a wolf
to kill a rabbit after playing with it.

359
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,354
That's just natural in this world now.

360
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,316
There are monsters that don't…

361
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:25,444
harm humans.

362
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,374
Why are you alone?

363
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:40,918
Where's Hyun-su?

364
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:44,129
We don't have time for this!

365
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,631
What do you mean?

366
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,008
If they come down, we're all dead!

367
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,217
What are you talking about?

368
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,886
Damn it.

369
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,763
Let's all survive together, okay?

370
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,692
I've never seen such a thing before.

371
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:11,365
It can't kill anything in this state.

372
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:15,285
Okay, I can see that there's a monster
that doesn't harm humans.

373
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,426
But will there be humans
that don't harm monsters?

374
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,350
Take a look at this.
