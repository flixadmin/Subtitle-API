1
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,456
Come. It's gonna be fine.

2
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,583
Nothing's going to happen to you.

3
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:43,377
Please...

4
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,845
Please...

5
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,932
No.

6
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,429
Take that with you.

7
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,803
- Careful.
- Yes, sir.

8
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,104
Were you shot?

9
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,566
No. Get him out.

10
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,444
- You're scaring him.
- Out!

11
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,537
What happened last night...
someone pays.

12
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,708
We took care of Calderón,

13
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,087
but those fucking gringos
still knock on my door!

14
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,840
Where the fuck were the guards?

15
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,010
Where the fuck were our men?

16
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:25,599
How the fuck did they know
where you were, Dad? How the fuck?

17
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,605
We have a rat.

18
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,482
An informant.

19
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,193
They found my ledger.

20
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,656
Hey, what about Enrique?

21
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:45,494
He was manning the checkpoint
when the cops came in.

22
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:34,335
Let's get inside.
Going once, going twice...

23
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,128
Girls, please.

24
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:40,299
No. You can't go out that way.
Please, no, sweetie.

25
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:45,054
Honey, let's go inside. Inside.

26
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,319
- Hello?
- 'Salcedo.'

27
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:03,530
No one's seen you since the raid.
Where the fuck are you?

28
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,616
David...

29
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,414
I'm having some trouble
with my wife lately...

30
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,334
...but I'm monitoring my radio.

31
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,879
- Have you talked to Enrique?
- 'Why?'

32
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,551
We've been trying to reach him.
My father wants to talk to him.

33
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,638
Your dad wants to talk to Enrique?

34
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:30,599
Do you have any problem with that?

35
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,979
- I'll find him.
- 'Good. Bring him in.

36
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:38,190
'And Salcedo, you come, too.'

37
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:55,499
I stand by the operation, Minister,
as does General Serrano.

38
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,751
Who was in Bogotá
at the time of the raid,

39
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,170
while you and your men were there
for five hours,

40
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,423
drilling holes, breaking furniture.

41
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,633
We were one minute away
from getting Miguel Rodríguez.

42
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,260
But you did not.

43
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:10,013
I need you to hand over all intel,
including informants,

44
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,558
over to a special prosecutor.

45
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:16,019
And I'm afraid the DEA can no longer
be part of this operation.

46
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:17,771
- You're taking us off?
- Yes, I am.

47
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,233
Minister, we recovered something
from the house.

48
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,572
It's a ledger.

49
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:32,453
Cartel accounts, transactions,
going back years.

50
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:35,247
- What is this? I don't see names.
- It's coded.

51
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:39,543
It's bribes, money laundering...
cocaine sales.

52
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,547
- Cali's whole operation.
- That's right.

53
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:48,343
- You have someone who can read it?
- There are two possibilities.

54
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,679
There's the cartel accountant,
Guillermo Pallomari.

55
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,558
Yeah, but he's underground.
Maybe worse.

56
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,145
And there's the money launderer
we extradited from Curaçao,

57
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,938
Franklin Jurado.

58
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:04,318
Jurado's the most important witness
to this case and he's in U.S. custody.

59
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,738
We're not handing him over
to a special prosecutor.

60
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,532
So you're welcome
to keep the ledger, Minister...

61
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:14,620
...but we have the only guy
who can read it.

62
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:26,798
Then, Agent Peña,
I suppose you have to see this out.

63
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,179
- Ambassador.
- Minister.

64
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:47,736
You make my job a lot fucking harder,
you know that?

65
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:51,448
Now you told me the only way
Jurado talks is if you find his wife.

66
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,787
Do you have any idea where she is?

67
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,082
I know someone who might.

68
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,210
'After the fall of Escobar,

69
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,713
'Medellín went from being
the most dangerous city in Colombia

70
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,882
'to one of its safest.

71
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,426
'That wasn't a result
of the end of cocaine trafficking.

72
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,303
'That was alive and well.

73
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,973
'It was due to the new
godfather of Medellín.

74
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:22,145
'His name is Diego Murillo,
but you know him as Don Berna.'

75
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,319
Did you find her?

76
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,281
Sure you don't want something?

77
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:36,493
- The <i>picada</i> here is the shit.
- You have what I asked for or not?

78
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:43,875
Pretty girl.
Long way from home.

79
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,102
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

80
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,062
I'm imagining the headline...

81
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:09,818
"American woman held hostage
in Colombian jungle." Fuck.

82
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,073
- Thanks for the info.
- Wait.

83
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,953
I'm going to help you
rescue the Barbie doll.

84
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:26,293
To do this job, we need to work
with some old friends of ours.

85
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,172
They can help us.

86
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:35,719
They know the terrain like the back
of their hand. How to get in and out.

87
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,817
What's it going to cost?

88
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,653
Cheap.

89
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,573
You just have to make me
a promise, Peña.

90
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:00,994
When my name pops up
on the DEA to-do list,

91
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,747
you pick up the phone and call me.

92
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,834
So I can be cautious and protect myself.

93
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,712
I see now...

94
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,801
A get-out-of-jail-free card.

95
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,262
Exactly.

96
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,183
To us, Peña.

97
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,771
Enrique!

98
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,442
- Boss.
- Open the door. Quick.

99
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:39,074
- Boss...
- What are you doing? Get in.

100
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,829
- What happened?
- David's been calling.

101
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,707
What for? He never called before.

102
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:51,336
- I wanted to talk to you first.
- Last night was a big fuck up.

103
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,797
You're in danger.
Pack a few things and let's go.

104
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,428
Jorge, I swear. I radioed in.

105
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,764
It doesn't matter, Enrique.
The DEA passed right in front of you.

106
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,892
I should just run, bro.

107
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,063
- Like Córdova?
- What? It doesn't matter!

108
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,400
Stay, run.
It's the same fucking thing!

109
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,485
No matter what I do,
I'm a fucking dead man.

110
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,698
Nobody is going to die, you hear me?
Nobody is going to die.

111
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,952
But right now, let's just get you
to tomorrow, Enrique.

112
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:39,676
Just keep paging him until he hits us
back. Nothing else we can do.

113
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,052
Fuck.

114
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,681
We should've arrested him.

115
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:49,019
You know, brought him in for assault
or something to save him.

116
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,313
Fuck. I hope we didn't
hang him out to dry.

117
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,651
I thought you didn't like him.

118
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,613
Yeah, doesn't mean I want him dead.

119
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,578
Why the fuck do I have
to hide here? I didn't do anything.

120
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,955
I know you didn't do anything.

121
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,708
This is David being an idiot.

122
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:18,131
But... trust me.
Have some patience. I'll handle it.

123
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,427
Jorge...

124
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,224
Last week, when you told me
to not say anything

125
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,435
about the DEA and their safe house...

126
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:35,774
That has nothing to do with anything.
Why are you bringing this up?

127
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,609
Stay focused.

128
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,111
Sit down. Sit down.

129
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,578
It's very important you do what I say.

130
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:52,666
Don't leave this room.
And don't call anyone.

131
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:57,462
Not your mother, your brother
or your girlfriend. No one. Understood?

132
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,925
Hey, look at me.

133
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,678
We'll get you through this.

134
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,430
I promise.

135
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,648
Thank you, Jorge.

136
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,276
Seriously.

137
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,952
- Jorge.
- Fercho, how's it going?

138
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,457
Don Miguel...

139
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,002
Where the fuck is Enrique, Jorge?

140
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,966
I left him messages at his house,
at the tap room,

141
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,093
but trust me, I'll find him.

142
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,054
Regardless of where he is,
you know him as well as me.

143
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,806
He's a man we can trust.

144
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,019
The thing is, Jorge, I don't know Enrique.

145
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,439
Because I didn't hire him, you did.

146
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,610
No, Córdova hired him.
But that doesn't matter.

147
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,237
I don't like to make judgments
before I know all the facts,

148
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,823
and we don't know them, David.

149
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:10,243
I find that funny, you know?

150
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,705
Because lately,
you're missing too many facts.

151
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,667
More specifically,
about the fucking DEA, Jorge. Huh?

152
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:22,589
When the DEA burst into the building,
I was six feet away from your dad.

153
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:28,053
Don Miguel, I've been investigating,
and it looks like Enrique did radio in.

154
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:31,723
I think the DEA is using a signal
to interfere with our radios.

155
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:32,974
Dad...

156
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,978
Dad, please.

157
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:41,232
It could be, it could be.

158
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,818
But you know what, Jorge?

knew where I was. Do you understand?

160
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,535
Yes, sir.

161
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,499
Someone sang and I want to know
who the fuck it was.

162
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,545
Find Enrique.
Let's have him speak for himself.

163
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:05,590
We fucking fix this once and for all.

164
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,489
- Hi, fellas.
- Sir.

165
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,075

Look at me.

186

Do you think an important man
like me

187
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:43,730
is going to risk his life
for some gringo piece of ass?

188
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:51,613
You don't know how to take a joke.

189
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,966

What about you, brother?
Are you trying to fuck us all or what?

what to do and what not to...

195
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:57,137
You know what, Gilberto?
Since you were a kid, you had a big mouth.

196

Why don't you just shut up?

197

He's fucking lost his mind.

198

- Uncle Miguel has to see that.
- I told him, no violence.

Is this all my fault?

Hello.

Any news?

214
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,053

on the other side of town.

215

he wouldn't be around anymore.

You know he's a mama's boy.
That fucker will be back.

219
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,904
So now what?

220

Now you go to Toro Negro.
Navegante's waiting for you.

221

He'll give you an assignment
from my father.

222
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,413
Why didn't he call me?

223
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,084
I'm going to explain something to you.

224
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:55,713
Until this is figured out,
you only talk to me. Understood?

225
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,425
Yes, sir.

226
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:05,181

With Fredy.
We're meeting a new client.

Fredy? Patricia, the police almost
caught Miguel yesterday.

280
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:26,752
- For fuck's sake!
- What's the problem?

281
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,963
You didn't tell them where he was,
did you?

282
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,382
- No.
- No. What are you worried about?

283
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,468
Miguel likes you.
That's what you always tell me.

284
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:39,181
- Yes, but always within limits.
- You're worrying too much, Guillermo.

285
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:42,893
They need you. You're the brains
behind the organisation...

286
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:48,733
None of that matters, Patricia, none,
if they decide not to leave loose ends.

287
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:51,569
You're giving me a headache.

288

Listen to me.

289
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:59,910
My love, we have to get out of here
before it's too late.

What is it, Jorge Salcedo?

293
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:48,250
What do we do if we find
Pallomari's family in the apartment?

294
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,338
Hope that we don't.

295
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:59,345
We'll need to be quick.
I have someplace to be.

296
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:07,561
The love of my life is in town
and we have a date.

297
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:14,360
That's great.
When was the last time you saw her?

298
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,278
Eight years.

299
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,824
Eight long years.

300
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:23,661
Why so long since last time
you saw her?

301
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:27,581
You know, she was abroad.

302
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,751
- In Japan.
- Japan?

303
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,838
Working?

304
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,883
She fucked a police captain.

305
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,011
Then she tried to turn me in.

306
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:44,598
All these years, I've been hanging
around her parents' house

307
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:47,017
waiting for her to come back.

308
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:52,940
People say things happen for a reason.
All I know is... she came back.

309
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,692
She came back.

310
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:01,949
Beautiful day. Right?

311
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:09,999
- How many tents, give or take?
- I think around 20.

312
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:14,170
The FARC arrange themselves
in staggered positions, two circles.

313
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:19,175
Then they always go for lookouts
in high places along the trails.

314
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,302
Sun sets in three hours.

315
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,388
As soon as they hear the chopper,
they're going to hide.

316
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:28,225
Generators, flashlights, fires...
everything.

317
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,936
Those rats have a lot of practice hiding.

318
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:35,357
Once the lights go, they'll use
guidelines strung into the jungle.

319
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,944
They grab hold, follow ropes to safety.

320
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:44,283
Once we find one of those ropes...

321
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,830
It's a fucking slaughter.

322
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,665
Berna...

323
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,353
Look, I don't want a bloodbath.

324
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,689
Listen to me, Peña.

325
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:19,944
You want the girl...
there will be a body count.

326
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:22,738
This is a war zone.

327
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:26,826
But if you want,
we can still call this thing off.

328
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:33,582
I need to get her back.

329
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,002
Just to be clear...

330
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:44,844
...something goes wrong,
you still keep your promise.

331
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:12,454
Hey, you talk to Pallomari,
try to keep him calm.

332
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,999
- Then I come in.
- Okay.

333
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,631
Pallomari?

334
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,176
Pallomari!

335
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,960
He's not here, of course.

336
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,341
No luggage.

337
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:10,512
Must've freaked out
when Miguel almost got caught.

338
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:15,392
You know, Pallomari,
he's the smart one.

339
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:19,396
Guess that's why
he's the accountant.

340
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,565
And not a thug.

341
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:26,362
Hey, Salcedo...

342
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,281
You'll need to find him.

343
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,951
Miguel gave this priority.
Do you understand?

344
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:35,996
- I'll take care of it.
- Let me know when you have him.

345
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,835
I need tonight
for the business I told you about.

346
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:44,922
Sure.

347
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,094
Good luck, then.

348
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,577
- 'Hey, it's me.'
- Salcedo! Busy today.

349
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:19,039
Listen... any chatter from Pallomari?

350
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,209
None I've heard.
But we got him.

351
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,338
- Who?
- 'Enrique.'

352
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:32,177
He called his brother, the idiot.
David's on his way to get him.

353
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:37,599
That's great news.
Miguel must be pleased.

354
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,714
- David?
- 'We have him.'

355
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,383
Yes?

356
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:14,344
'He showed up at the house?'

357
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:17,556
Meet us at 11th & 614th.

358
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:31,653
You ever hear anything
from Judy?

359
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:34,156
Not since you sold her out.

360
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:37,284
Who'd have thought it, Javier?
Both of us, bosses.

361
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,953
They give you a nice place in Bogotá?

362
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,041
- It's good.
- You should see my house.

363
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:49,213
I can take a shit in a different bathroom
every day of the week. My wife loves it.

364
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:51,465
Your wife?

365
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,968
I'm a family man.

366
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:59,306
Bet you still live out of a suitcase.

367
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:06,939
Guess catching guys like me
makes it all worth it. Right?

368
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:18,450
Don't forget the suitcase.

369
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,160
Keep going!

370
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:23,330
Come on. Let's go!
Assume position!

371
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:40,013
'Be advised, team:
five minutes to LZ.'

372
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,388
Let's see how our new toys work.

373
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,854
Get ready.

374
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,525
God bless America.

375
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,520
Our guest of honour's arrived.

376
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,401
What's going on here?

377
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:05,117
Jorge, you're going to have
to explain some things.

378
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,883
Alpha in position.

379
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,428
Tell him what you told us.

380
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:29,808
- Huh?
- Salcedo knew about the DEA.

381
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:34,021
You're going to talk to me
like a man, motherfucker.

382
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:38,483
Salcedo works with the DEA!
He knew the DEA was in Cali.

383
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:43,405
He knew where they were at,
and he told me to watch them.

384
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,575
And he told me not to tell you.

385
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,083
'Charlie in position.'

386
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:00,589
Bravo in position.

387
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:04,676
Everyone's in position.
Rotor, force them to the north.

388
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,762
'Copy that.
We're going to push them out.

389
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:09,681
'We're circling back.
Arriving in 30 seconds.'

390
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:14,978
Is that true, Jorge? Tell me.

391
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:19,191
Tell me.
Are you working with the DEA?

392
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,862
Sir... it's true that I've been
successfully tracking the DEA.

393
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:27,866
But saying that I knew where
their safe house is, that's absurd.

394
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:32,371
'Rotor ETA five seconds.
We have visual.'

395
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:44,257
'FARC is on the move.
They're going dark.'

396
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:50,180
'Peña, they have your girlfriend
in the southeast part of camp.'

397
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:57,562
Let's move.

398
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,399
They're about to kill me
because of you, motherfucker!

399
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:03,485
That fucking son of a bitch is lying!

400
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,655
If you're looking for an infiltrator,
it's him, not me.

401
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,992
Shut up! Know what they're gonna do
to my family if you say that shit?

402
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,452
You son of a bitch!

403
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,704
Let go of me!
I'll kill you, motherfucker!

404
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,916
- Let it go, motherfucker!
- Sir, that bastard is lying!

405
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,752
What do you want me to say
if that's the truth, motherfucker?

406
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,170
Cut the bullshit!

407
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:30,011
'All right, men,
let's get these fireworks started.'

408
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:33,849
'And don't be pussies.
This is easy. Get ready.

409
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:36,893
'This shit is on!'

410
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:42,649
I'm tired of this, Dad.

411
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,568
Sir, no.

412
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:47,362
David, please. What is this?

413
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,991
- Sir, I have no idea...
- Dad...

414
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,626
What the fuck's that?

415
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,844
What the fuck is that?

416
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,973
Huh? Is that you, motherfucker?
Huh?

417
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,350
- No.
- What the fuck is that?

418
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,401
- What the fuck is this?
- I don't know, sir. I've never seen that!

419
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:29,905
Sir, I swear
I've never seen that before.

420
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:35,285
'Let's give those fucking
guerrillas a rain of bullets!'

421
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,413
'They're in the river!
Give them lead!'

422
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:41,958
Sir... it's a SkyPager.

423
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,461
It's American high-end tech.

424
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,922
- Don Miguel, please!
- Shut up.

425
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:49,216
- What the fuck does it say?
- Let's see.

426
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,177
These are messages in English.
He's your rat!

427
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:55,639
Motherfucker, you're going to have
my family killed dragging me into this!

428
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,142
It's not yours?
It's not yours, Enrique?

429
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:02,062
- Sir, I swear I've never seen that before.
- Shh!

430
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:05,315
I swear on my mother
I've never seen that before, Don Miguel!

431
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,568
- Can they track us with this shit?
- I think so, sir.

432
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:09,861
Motherfucker!

433
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:13,490
- No.
- Don't move.

434
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:18,286
- Please! Don Miguel, no!
- Don't move.

435
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:19,579
No! Let me go!

436
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,125
Tell the truth, motherfucker!

437
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:26,336
Salcedo, you motherfucker!

438
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,505
Ah! Don Miguel!

439
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:38,181
Look, Jorge. Your friend.

440
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,645
- Christina...
- Don't. Don't.

441
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,606
Stay where you are.
Put the gun down!

442
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,984
Don't move.

443
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:50,902
- Stay still.
- Please.

444
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,154
One more step and I'll...

445
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,756
The rat is dead.

446
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:23,268
What's wrong? Start!

447
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,232
Feistl.

448
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:32,193
I have her. Get Franklin ready.

449
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,856
Okay? You're going home.

450
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:13,735
You're going home. Okay?

451
00:44:32,796 --> 00:44:35,131
Yes, I know my signature.

452
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:38,885
- Hi!
- Hi, Dad!

453
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,929
Where's Mum?

454
00:44:41,054 --> 00:44:44,265
Jorge?
She doesn't want to see you.

455
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,226
Paola!

456
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:49,771
Paola! Paola!

457
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:53,108
Have some respect.
This is my mother's house!

458
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:57,779
What's going on?

459
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,701
What is it?

460
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,247
What's going on?

461
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,958
Breathe.

462
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:15,588
What happened?

463
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:19,175
What's going on? Come here.

464
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:49,581
In less than an hour,
we're on that plane.

465
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,919
Your husband knows.

466
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:58,548
He'll be waiting for you.

467
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,138
It's all behind you now, Christina.

468
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:12,604
And you think
I should thank you for that?

469
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:16,065
No.

470
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,068
No, I don't.

471
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:24,657
No, you think you're a hero
because you, what,

472
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:27,869
executed a bunch of farmers
to get me out

473
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:30,580
so that my husband
would testify for you?

474
00:46:32,207 --> 00:46:35,877
I did what I had to do
and I'm sorry for what happened to you.

475
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:41,549
No.

476
00:46:42,926 --> 00:46:45,929
No, you're not.
And you know it.

477
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,391
You're a piece of shit.

478
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:39,732
- Salcedo?
- 'I know where Miguel is.'

479
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:43,653
- This needs to happen right now.
- 'Yeah, of course.'

480
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,614
'Your code name for me? Natalia?'

481
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:49,784
- What about it?
- 'They know. You have a leak.

482
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,995
'The cartel knows about it.

483
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,455
'It won't be long before
they know about me.'

484
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:58,501
This needs to happen now
or I'm dead.

485
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,349
Call for you. Number four.

486
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:17,812
Hello?

487
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,607
Hello?

488
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:23,484
- Hello?
- Brother...

489
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:29,616
That phone doesn't work.
Try number five.

490
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,209
You're Colombian.

491
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,795
Right?

492
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,257
I'm from Cali.

493
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:07,904
Hello? Hello?

494
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:24,170
Yeah?

495
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:27,382
'Hey, it's been taken care of.'

496
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:43,147
Yeah?

497
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:47,026
Yeah, we're about to get on the plane.
We'll be in Miami...

498
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:55,493
When?

499
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:06,963
Let me call you back.
