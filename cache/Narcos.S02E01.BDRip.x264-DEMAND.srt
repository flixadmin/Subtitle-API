1
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,322
<i>Okay. Here we go again.</i>

2
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,060
<i>Let me break it down for you.</i>

3
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,197
<i>Four thousand soldiers...</i>

4
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:41,403
<i>a 250-man team
of Colombia's elite forces...</i>

5
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,304
<i>tens of thousands of rounds fired...</i>

6
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,578
<i>seven dogs...</i>

7
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,385
<i>and four fuckin' helicopters.</i>

8
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:59,025
<i>Pablo Escobar was surrounded
in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.</i>

9
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,754
<i>There was no way
he was getting out of this one, right?</i>

10
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:08,267
Hey, Jimenez. Do you think
the Special Forces guys killed him?

11
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,336
If he can even be killed, that is.

12
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,011
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

13
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:22,843
I don't know.
I heard they shot him 20 times.

14
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,713
They pumped him full of lead.

15
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:29,120
Then they burned his body
and spread his ashes all over Medellín.

16
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:35,059
They say that he rose from the ashes,

17
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:38,257
and he went to the houses
of each of the men who had shot him,

18
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:41,130
and he killed them as they slept.

19
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,531
Bullshit.

20
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,469
Quiet! Someone's coming.

21
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,938
We're soldiers from the National Army!

22
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,271
Stop and identify yourselves!

23
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,705
We're well armed!

24
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,555
Mr. Escobar.

25
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:14,333
I'm sorry, but we've been ordered
to not let you through.

26
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,835
We have to take you into custody.

27
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,946
Son, I'm sorry to say...

28
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,179
unfortunately,
I can't allow that to happen.

29
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,529
Excuse me.

30
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,175
You don't speak a word of this to anyone,
understood?

31
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,778
<i>Yep.</i>

32
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,978
<i>Life ain't fair, man.</i>

33
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:53,387
<i>Pablo Escobar? He was headed home.</i>

34
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,119
<i>As for me and Connie, well,
we were in some deep shit,</i>

35
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,720
<i>and I hadn't even heard the news.</i>

36
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,063
This is what I do. This is my job.

37
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,466
No, don't you dare say this is your job.

38
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,664
I know what your fucking job is.

39
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:09,072
And it doesn't entail being kidnapped
by a Colombian drug cartel.

40
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,907
Listen, I'm sorry, I am.
I know it must've been tough for you.

41
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,937
Listen, but Connie,
I was never in any danger.

42
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,280
I'm here now, back with you.


43
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:26,860
All I want is for us to be safe.

44
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,660
I want to get the hell out of this place
and I want to go home.

45
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,938
- Murphy.
- Escobar's out.

46
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,273
- What?
- He's fucking out.

47
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:49,646
He took Sandoval hostage during the siege
and when the army went in, he escaped.

48
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,013
Walked right out.

49
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,387
Pick me up in ten minutes.
I'll meet you downstairs.

50
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,666
Escobar's escaped.

51
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,367
<i>And you know what?</i>

52
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,244
<i>I was happy about it.</i>

53
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:24,014
<i>The fox was out of the cage
and the hunt was on.</i>

54
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,654
<i>Yeah, it was the biggest
law enforcement blunder of all time.</i>

55
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,091
<i>Fortunately, it wasn't our blunder.</i>

56
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,683
This...

57
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,894
is an enormous embarrassment
for all of Colombia, gentlemen.

58
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,497
So...

59
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,404
- How will we proceed?
- Mr. President...

60
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:54,779
Mr. President, Escobar will surely attempt
to reestablish himself within the city,

61
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:58,442
and we can't allow him and his sicarios
to move freely.

62
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:02,010
So my recommendation, Mr. President,
is that we occupy Medellín.

63
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,752
Flood the streets with officers.
Conduct searches.

64
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:09,557
Close down the streets.
Establish vehicle checkpoints.

65
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,358
Pressure him until he appears,
Mr. President.

66
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,456
And who would conduct such an operation?

67
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,591
Colonel Pinzón, sir.

68
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,607
- He should begin immediately.
- Of course, Mr. President.

69
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,637
Are you injured?

70
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,543
No, I'm not hurt.

71
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,082
You know I couldn't talk to him.

72
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,643
I couldn't negotiate with Escobar.

73
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,580
- I understand.
- Why did you go inside?

74
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,715
I sensed something was off.

75
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,592
Ariza said his orders were
to secure the perimeter, that's all.

76
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,892
Wait, he lied. I gave the order myself.

77
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,600
Go home and get some rest,
but come back soon.

78
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,899
You know you're the only person
I can trust.

79
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,099
Yes, sir.

80
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,749
It's all right, Tata. I'll be right back.
Excuse me, Doña Hermilda.

81
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:09,948
Boss.

82
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,020
- It's good to see you.
- It's great to have you back home.

83
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,686
Very good to see you.

84
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,923
He's here. It's him.

85
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,764
- Praise the Lord. I knew it. I knew it.
- How are you, brother?

86
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,034
Pablo!

87
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,009
Thank God.

88
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,543
- Oh, my son!
- How are you?

89
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,944
- I'm all right.
- You're all right?

90
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,381
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

91
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,043
- You're all right?
- I'm all right.

92
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,393
- I did everything I could, Dad.
- I know.

93
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,722
I know.

94
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,799
I am very proud.

95
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,863
I love you very much.

96
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,405
It's Dad.

97
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:15,580
You and your family. May he always
protect you in his holy glory.

98
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,178
Thank you very much.

99
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,316
You're great boys.

100
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:28,024
- Monitor the police frequencies.
- Yes.

101
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:31,332
And don't bother me unless it's necessary.

102
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,031
As you wish, boss.

103
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,702
Very good.

104
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,403
Very good, gentlemen.

105
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,681
Very good.

106
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,720
Please take the things out of the car
and organize them over there.

107
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,603
I felt I'd lost you.

108
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,609
You're never going to lose me.

109
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,948
And what now, Pablo?

110
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,819
What will we do now?

111
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,623
I did what I had to do, Tata.

112
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,789
I'll take care of it.

113
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:40,129
We'll be fine, and content,

114
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,177
and happy, and together and united.

115
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,472
But...

116
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:47,910
Always.

117
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,091
Always.

118
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,661
- Tell me you'll never leave me.
- Never.

119
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:06,997
Promise.

120
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,097
I promise.

121
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,037
I promise, my love.

122
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,297
Pablo Escobar has escaped from prison.

123
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,535
He is out of that prison again
after a bizarre showdown between...

124
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,670
<i>By morning,
word was out on the streets</i>

125
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,806
<i>and all eyes were on Medellín.</i>

126
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,047
<i>This wasn't just a manhunt.
This was an invasion.</i>

127
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,753
<i>Gaviria was willing to go
door to door to catch Escobar.</i>

128
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,656
<i>And we wanted to be a part of it.</i>

129
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,692
<i>After all,
we represented America down here.</i>

130
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:16,099
<i>We thought of ourselves
as the guys who could get shit done.</i>

131
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,104
Jesus Christ.

132
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,104
Agent Murphy, Agent Peña. DEA.

133
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:27,043
I understand you're from the DEA,
but I have to ask Colonel Pinzón.

134
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,171
Wait one moment.

135
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:32,110
- Name Pinzón mean anything to you?
- No, don't know him.

136
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,249
You see this?

137
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,456
Well, it looks like we're not invited
to the dance.

138
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,358
Gentlemen, wait here for a moment.

139
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,398
We'll let you in once the area is secured,
understood?

140
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,559
Yeah, you mean when nothing's left inside.

141
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,397
We're going to have to move everything.

142
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:55,538
- What do you mean by everything?
- Everything. The labs...

143
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:02,745
the offices, the hideouts, the deposits,
we're moving everything.

144
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,806
Boss, even the labs?

145
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,780
They're well-guarded. There's no problem.

146
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:12,051
Come on, don't you know
what's going on at La Catedral?

147
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:16,722
The cops are going through all of the maps
and documents you idiots left behind.

148
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,924
Now we can't trust anyone, you bastards.

149
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,057
Who are you calling a bastard,
you son of a bitch? Huh?

150
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,968
We're moving everything.

151
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,434
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

152
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,135
Yes, Don Pablo.

153
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,610
We're also going to need more men.

154
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,014
Last night we lost a lot of brothers.

155
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,149
- May they rest in peace.
- Amen.

156
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:45,754
And one last thing.

157
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:50,986
I'm going to need a good driver with a
clean record to drive me around the city.

158
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:56,797
He needs to be smart, fearless, and loyal.

159
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:00,196
- Done, boss.
- Boss, I'm sorry,

160
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,640
but you can't risk yourself like that.

161
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,179
Yes, Don Pablo, I agree with Velasco.

162
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,708
I want people to know that Pablo Escobar
doesn't hide like a rat.

163
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,818
Because we...

164
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,393
are the Medellín cartel, motherfucker!

165
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,293
<i>Now keep in mind...</i>

166
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,561
<i>the Medellín cartel
wasn't just one big gang.</i>

167
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:30,466
<i>It was made up of a bunch
of smaller gangs.</i>

168
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,300
<i>A collective, so to speak.</i>

169
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:36,331
<i>And as far as Pablo was concerned,
he was still their leader.</i>

170
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,507
<i>In his mind, every trafficker in Medellín
had to pay tribute to him.</i>

171
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,877
<i>Only a guy who'd killed
thousands of people</i>

172
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:47,817
<i>could think Judy Moncada would forget
what he'd done to her husband Kiko</i>

173
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,413
<i>and his business partner
Fernando Galeano,</i>

174
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:53,322
<i>the guys who were running his business
while he was inside.</i>

175
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,693
<i>Fuckin' psycho. He thought
that they were stealing from him...</i>

176
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,859
<i>and naturally,
they got the short end of the stick.</i>

177
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:00,990
Pablo, no!

178
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:08,204
You believe whatever the fuck
you want to believe, you son of a bitch!

179
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,402
<i>Why he thought Judy'd be okay
with that...</i>

180
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,070
<i>Well, she wasn't.</i>

181
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:18,283
<i>And alongside her brother Jaime,
and head of security Diego Murillo,</i>

182
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:23,379
<i>a.k.a. Don Berna, they'd broken away
from the Medellín cartel.</i>

183
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:27,222
<i>And now that Pablo was out,
they wanted payback.</i>

184
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:33,221
<i>And as for the other gangs,
they were all up for grabs.</i>

185
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,796
<i>Take the Prisco brothers, for instance.</i>

186
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,703
<i>The oldest of whom, Ricardo,</i>

187
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,105
<i>was a respected member
of the medical community.</i>

188
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:50,906
<i>He didn't know who to side with.</i>

189
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,315
<i>Neither did the Gallón gang,</i>

190
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,944
<i>who became famous a year later</i>

191
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:58,251
<i>when they murdered Colombian soccer player
Andrés Escobar</i>

192
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:02,989
<i>for accidentally scoring a goal against
his own country in the 1994 World Cup.</i>

193
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,798
<i>But this wasn't a soccer game.
This was the blow business.</i>

194
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,304
<i>And whose side they chose would come down
to two things, who offered the better deal</i>

195
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,636
<i>and who had the better chance
of winning the war.</i>

196
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,506
This again? Stop obsessing. Relax.

197
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,807
Relax? What do you want me to do?

198
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,939
Should I sit here and wait for Pablo
to walk through that door

199
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:27,145
and kill me and my daughter?
He's going to come and kill you too.

200
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,745
- What do you think about that?
- Pablo won't be killing anyone, all right?

201
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,814
Jaime, what country do you live in?

202
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,758
If he hasn't killed anyone yet,
he's planning on it.

203
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:41,263
Haven't you noticed, Berna?
Judy, haven't you noticed?

204
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,860
Gaviria's got this city
swarming with cops.

205
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,871
There's a cop
on every fucking street corner.

206
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,935
Pablo can't move.

207
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,946
Then we have to find and kill the bastard
before the police find him.

208
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,503
Judy, listen.

209
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,607
Listen to me! Listen!

210
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:03,121
Pablo, right now, it's like
he's like a caged rat. Understand?

211
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,714
Jaime.

212
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:09,386
Despite everything, you still don't know
what Pablo's capable of?

213
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:13,398
- He's someone we can't underestimate.
- You said it, Berna.

214
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,400
They shouldn't underestimate us either.

215
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,664
And Pablo's got very few friends left,
and you know it.

216
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:21,366
Pablo will always have friends.

217
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:25,806
Berna, I want everyone to know
what happened to Kiko.

218
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:32,243
It should be clear
that being loyal to Escobar

219
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,513
will only earn you a bullet in the head.

220
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:38,820
They'll know what side
they should be on, right?

221
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,188
Judy...

222
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,419
what do we do with the labs?

223
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,868
What do you suggest?

224
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:54,662
I think we shut down the labs,
at least for a while.

225
00:17:56,242 --> 00:18:01,009
We have to lay low
until Pablo is killed or captured.

226
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,278
That's stupid, Berna.
Tell me how that makes any sense. Huh?

227
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:09,082
A lot of other people also stopped
paying Pablo at the same time as us.

228
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,247
Let's join forces with them.

229
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:14,554
There's the Priscos, for example.
Last night I met with Ricardo.

230
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,254
I'll talk to him.

231
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:19,195
Jaime, be very careful with those people.

232
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,099
- Hello?
- Okay?

233
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,105
- That looks nice.
- One moment.

234
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,402
Ricardo?

235
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:34,741
Don Pablo.

236
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,713
Of course. There was no decision to make.

237
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,819
You know that you can always count on us.

238
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,666
Sweetie!

239
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,673
Hey!

240
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:02,832
Fag!

241
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,434
What's going on, Limón?

242
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:08,674
- Son of a bitch.
- How's it going, brother? Good or what?

243
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:13,685
Quica, my love, come give me
the best 20 minutes of my life.

244
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,777
What are you doing here? Are you going in?

245
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,983
No, brother.
I didn't come to see the whores.

246
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,787
- Then what?
- I came to see you, brother.

247
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:27,493
And from what I can see,
you're still driving whores everywhere.

248
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,500
You know how it is. I have to pay rent.

249
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,704
Listen, Limón,
don't you want to make good money?

250
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,672
Doing what?

251
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,844
- The same thing, brother.
- Driving who?

252
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,779
Pablo Escobar, brother.

253
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:48,844
- Eat shit, you son of a bitch.
- Limón, I'm serious, brother.

254
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:52,982
The boss asked us to find someone...

255
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,393
someone clean, who the police don't know.

256
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,158
He would go in the trunk.

257
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:05,561
- Where would I have to take him?
- Wherever he wants to go. You don't ask.

258
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,402
What do you think, brother?

259
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:13,873
There's cops everywhere.

260
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,914
Why don't we put a girl in the back
so no one gets suspicious?

261
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,916
- Which one of the whores do you trust?
- They're whores, brother.

262
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,423
Then who, brother?

263
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,992
- No!
- No?

264
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,658
- Thank you.
- Why not, Maritza?

265
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,994
- No.
- What's wrong with it? Nothing.

266
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,399
- I'm very busy, Jhon.
- That doesn't matter, Maritza.

267
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,568
Yes?

268
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,763
Ask one of the girls
you drive around all day.

269
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,672
- I can't.
- Get out of my way.

270
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:47,543
Maritza, I need you to do it.

271
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,583
It'll be the easiest money
you'll make in your life.

272
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:53,448
You can quit your second job, understand?

273
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,281
You'll be able to take care
of your daughter.

274
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,515
Haven't I always done right by you?

275
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,083
I've always helped you
and your family, right? So?

276
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,795
Right?

277
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,623
You're a son of a bitch, you know?

278
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,363
So what? Hmm?

279
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,890
- And who's that?
- He's a friend. He's trustworthy.

280
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,226
What's up, Quica?
This is the girl I told you about.

281
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,801
Let's go.

282
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,804
Take care, skinny!

283
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,074
- All good?
- All good, brother.

284
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,511
I'll follow you, brother.

285
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:59,183
- Who's that bitch?
- Close your fucking legs, Rosa.

286
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:01,014
You'll kill all the flowers.

287
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,090
You shit-eating bastard.
This pussy smells great.

288
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,022
Now you're going to the market
to buy your whores, you bastard?

289
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,788
Don't get pissy.

290
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:13,093
If you're in a better mood
when I come back this afternoon,

291
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,496
you'll get to fuck me.

292
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:18,297
Fucking Quica.

293
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,362
Shut up! Go inside! Watch yourself!

294
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,544
<i>Looking for a place
for your next corporate retreat?</i>

295
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:33,550
<i>Or maybe a quiet getaway
for the whole family?</i>

296
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:39,489
<i>How about 360 degrees of unobstructed
views of the Antioquian countryside?</i>

297
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:43,990
<i>Sixty thousand square feet
of creative living space.</i>

298
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,692
<i>Perfect for entertaining.</i>

299
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:54,502
<i>Look no further than La Catedral.</i>

300
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:56,665
<i>One man's prison...</i>

301
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,704
<i>is anyone else's palace.</i>

302
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,310
<i>Yep, it was a beautiful place.</i>

303
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,717
<i>And when the Colombian cops
were done with it,</i>

304
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:11,756
<i>they were gracious enough
to let us pick through the leftovers.</i>

305
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,561
This and Mein Kampf.

306
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:21,493
Two classics of 20th century literature.

307
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,366
Yeah, what do you think the rent's like?
I'm thinking about moving in.

308
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,608
Hey, Javi, you think the... the Hague
would want a couple of these?

309
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,736
How are you not wearing rubber gloves
touching that shit, man?

310
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:48,251
We should take this stuff to our office.
It's better than any of the shit we got.

311
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:53,028
Fuckin' Pinzón's guys have taken
everything that's useful. There's nothing.

312
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,930
Look, I think I found something
that might help.

313
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,433
Oh, yeah?

314
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,901
What's that?

315
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:04,935
Wait.

316
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,654
Ready? Close your eyes.

317
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:19,990
That's right.

318
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:24,890
It's a little bunny, my love.
She's very delicate.

319
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,462
Boss?

320
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,412
Look, Don Pablo...

321
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:52,091
this is the guy
I've been telling you about, Limón.

322
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,454
He's Guarazapo's cousin.

323
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:59,588
Limón! Come here, brother. Come on!

324
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,699
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

325
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,673
Don't worry, boss.
We've known each other for a long time.

326
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:14,872
Besides, he's never had any run-ins
with police. He's clean.

327
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,675
And where are you from, son?

328
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:19,342
I was born in Envigado, sir.

329
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,385
My mother lives in the barrio
you built for us.

330
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,381
I'm very glad.

331
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,358
- What about the girl?
- She...

332
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,155
She's a friend, boss.

333
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:33,896
We went to school together in Envigado.
I know her very well

334
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:37,902
and I know where she works,
so she's someone we can trust, boss.

335
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,570
Listen, Limón...

336
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,636
Do you know what it means to work for me?

337
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,148
It's an honor to work for you, Don Pablo.

338
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:54,047
You've done so much
for the poor in Medellín...

339
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,747
if I have to lose my life for you...

340
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,985
I will, boss.

341
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,264
All right.

342
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,329
Open the trunk.

343
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,612
<i>After La Catedral,
the next stop was Carlos Holguín...</i>

344
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:27,447
<i>the old police training academy
that had been repurposed as ground zero</i>

345
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,385
<i>in the search for Escobar.</i>

346
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,718
<i>The new honcho was Colonel Pinzón,</i>

347
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,784
<i>the guy who was famous
for his love of Uncle Sam.</i>

348
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,454
As a courtesy to your government,

349
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:41,192
I'm allowing you to participate
in this manhunt.

350
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:46,295
But I set the limits
and all decisions rest with me.

351
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:50,273
If this condition is unacceptable,
take it up with the president.

352
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,605
Of course, Colonel.

353
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,440
I hope we didn't get off
on the wrong foot.

354
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,982
Not at all. Every operation
needs a well-defined hierarchy.

355
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,963
I hope this will be an adequate space
for you to do your work.

356
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:17,430
- What, you're talking about this? This...
- This is more than adequate.

357
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:22,074
- Gracias, Colonel.
- Welcome.

358
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,409
Oh, wow, this is from 1962.

359
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,351
<i>Like most tricks Pablo employed,</i>

360
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:42,519
<i>the audacity and simplicity of the taxi
was pretty damn good.</i>

361
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:46,629
<i>I mean, who in the hell would think
that the seventh richest man in the world</i>

362
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,668
<i>would be riding around in the trunk
of a piece of shit taxi?</i>

363
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,964
Don't worry, brother. Everything's good.

364
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:56,440
<i>As smart as it was, Pablo wasn't the
kind of guy who left anything to chance.</i>

365
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:00,476
<i>Despite his absence, he still
had a loyal following in Medellín.</i>

366
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,542
<i>And a network of spotters,
kids mainly.</i>

367
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,483
<i>And they were everywhere
in the comunas.</i>

368
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:13,789
<i>The spotters could identify
which streets to take</i>

369
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,884
<i>and which ones to avoid.</i>

370
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:19,626
All yours.

371
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,073
Where are we?

372
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:42,313
- What the fuck are we doing here, Jhon?
- Get down and hide.

373
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,549
- Jhon, I don't...
- Shit, Maritza.

374
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,852
I don't have time
to give you explanations.

375
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,359
Just do it, all right?

376
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:21,882
Don Pablo.

377
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,428
- Hello.
- Welcome.

378
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:26,623
Thank you. No, don't get up. Don't get up.

379
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,757
- How are you?
- Very well.

380
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,392
Great, I'm very glad.

381
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:35,365
- Rojas.
- Don Pablo.

382
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,805
- Sir.
- How have you been?

383
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,398
Well, sir. How are you?
I wasn't expecting you.

384
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:40,536
- I'm well. Very well.
- Guys, please.

385
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,102
Yes, sir.

386
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:44,205
- Don Pablo.
- Do you want anything to drink, sir?

387
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,250
- A coffee?
- No, thank you.

388
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:48,753
- Can I get you anything?
- Thank you, I'm fine.

389
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:53,623
- How are you?
- I'm well, sir. Everything is well.

390
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,786
- How is Maribel?
- Maribel is well, sir. Thank you.

391
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,454
Good, brother.

392
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,964
What's going on with the deposits?

393
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,162
They're looking a little light.

394
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:06,260
Well, after everything
that happened with...

395
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:11,172
with Mr. Galeano
and Mr. Moncada, well...

396
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,768
people are nervous, you understand?

397
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:18,578
This woman, Judy Moncada,
has been talking to people.

398
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,619
Not everyone wants to pay.

399
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:29,328
- So that's it?
- That's it, sir. I thought you knew.

400
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:33,422
- I told them to tell you...
- Calm down. Don't worry about that.

401
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:37,662
We'll fix that problem soon.

402
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:38,964
Yes, sir.

403
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,330
In the meantime...

404
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,971
I want you to move
to the offices in Laureles.

405
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,476
It's no longer safe here.

406
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,281
- Done, sir. Whatever you say.
- Good.

407
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,681
And fill this up, please.

408
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,163
Don Pablo!

409
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,160
- Sir, how are...
- Is that you?

410
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:15,366
- How are you, sir?
- Sweetie! Sweetie!

411
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:18,842
Sweetie!
Don Pablo is in front of our house.

412
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,309
Don Pablo?

413
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,177
- Don Pablo!
- Hello, Ma'am. How are you?

414
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:23,681
- Fine, and you?
- I'm well.

415
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:25,979
- It's him, old man.
- Sir, how are you?

416
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,383
- How is your health?
- It's good. Very good!

417
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,922
Good. Good. How are all of you?
Good? Good?

418
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,581
- How are you, Don Pablo?
- Good.

419
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:34,090
- It's him.
- How are you?

420
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,682
- In the flesh?
- How are you, son?

421
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:39,197
- Good?
- Boss, we should get going.

422
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,995
Let them see me. Let them see me.

423
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,933
- I never thought I'd meet you in person.
- How are you?

424
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,764
I'm well, Ma'am, how are you?

425
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:50,240
- Here, boss, behind you.
- Here. Let's see.

426
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:53,437
- Generous as always, Don Pablo.
- For you.

427
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:56,515
- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- For the doctor, sir. For the doctor.

428
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,879
- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- Take care of yourself.

429
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,186
For you, Ma'am.

430
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,046
For you too, sir.

431
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,215
Seriously? Directly in front of me!

432
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,251
I don't spend enough time
looking at your face?

433
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:37,549
That's better.

434
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:43,123
There's a girl on line three.
She wants to talk to an American.

435
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,565
Nothing?

436
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,432
You picked up the American part, right?

437
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,638
Murphy!

438
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,971
- What's wrong, brother?
- Suck my dick, please.

439
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,781
- DEA, Agent Peña.
- Pay attention.

440
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,785
I know where you can find
one of Escobar's men.

441
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,151
Oh, yeah? Which one?

442
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,249
There's a reward, right?

443
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,018
Yes, there's a reward.

444
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,155
What's your information, miss?
Who are you talking about?

445
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,601
La Quica.

446
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,770
La Quica?

447
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,939
You know La Quica?

448
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,605
He came to the brothel on 23rd street.

449
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,342
He left with a man in a taxi
and said he would return later.

450
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,111
Do you work there?

451
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,713
Yes.

452
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:47,887
How long ago was this?

453
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,485
A couple of hours ago.

454
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:54,294
All right, we'll look into it.

455
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,695
- You think it's legit?
- Let's find out.

456
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,917
How credible is your source?

457
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,684
It was an unsolicited phone call.
She asked to speak to an American.

458
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,657
We would just need a couple of cars
and a few men.

459
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,751
Well, my men are either busy here
or outside in the street.

460
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,991
And I'm not relocating men
to chase down bullshit tips.

461
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,091
If this turns out not to be bullshit,
La Quica could give us Pablo.

462
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,402
So go. Go ahead.

463
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:36,907
Since when do you need an excuse
to go to a whorehouse?

464
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,179
It would be worth investigating, Colonel.

465
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,410
We're not asking for a lot.

466
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:52,289
One vehicle, three men.

467
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,585
Gracias.

468
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,025
Did you close the lab?

469
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,899
Jesus Christ.

470
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,304
No, Berna, and I won't
because it's not necessary.

471
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:12,968
- Listen to me, Jaime...
- No, you listen to me. Enough of this.

472
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:15,376
I already spoke with
Ricardo Prisco, all right?

473
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,882
He's with us. He supports us.

474
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,441
Everything is firm. Everything is good.
What more could we want?

475
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:23,783
I told you to be careful
with those people, Jaime.

476
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:24,980
Pay attention to me.

477
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:28,720
First, these guys have been with us
since Pablo killed Kiko, right?

478
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,455
Second, Ricardo knows
that being loyal to Pablo

479
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:33,156
means a bullet in the head, brother.

480
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:37,599
And third, and to ease your mind,
they're sending us men, for security...

481
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:38,966
What?

482
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,301
So you gave these people
the address to the lab?

483
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:45,172
Don't be an idiot.
How else would they get here?

484
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,441
Jaime, listen to me.

485
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,744
Get out of there now.
Get moving and come here right now!

486
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,784
Listen to me, Berna!
Stop with the paranoia, brother!

487
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,811
Jaime! Jaime! Get out now!

488
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,822
- Come here now!
- Come play, motherfuckers!

489
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:03,661
Jaime! Jaime!

490
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:04,752
Get out now!

491
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:11,498
What's going on, Ricardo?

492
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:15,437
You're fucking up, man.

493
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,604
Ricardo, put the gun down, brother.

494
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:22,143
Ricardo, put it down.
Pablo is weak right now, brother.

495
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,181
You know this.

496
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,614
The city's filled with cops.

497
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:29,977
Pablo can't move, brother.

498
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,716
Ricardo, put the gun down.

499
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,295
Hello, Jaime.

500
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,630
Jaime.

501
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,968
- Berna, how have you been?
- Who's this?

502
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:52,909
This is Pablo speaking. I imagine
you want to talk to Jaime, right?

503
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,505
Berna, help me, man.

504
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:01,416
Berna, talk to Pablo.
Explain everything, Berna! Help me!

505
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,884
Pablo, no! Wait!

506
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,930
And now, you fat son of a bitch...

507
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:18,501
we're coming after you
and that bitch you protect.

508
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,835
Pablo, you've just made
the biggest mistake.

509
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,601
Tell the others...

510
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:25,340
Who is it?

511
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:30,444
that Pablo Escobar is to be respected,

512
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,175
you son of a bitch.

513
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,858
That son of a bitch!
His entire family, do you understand?

514
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,020
I want everyone
in his fucking family dead!

515
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,393
That fat fuck!

516
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,297
Son of a bitch!

517
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,801
Listen, Judy...

518
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:57,465
I'm very sorry about Jaime, and I'm very
sorry about all of these deaths.

519
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:01,102
We have to accept that we lost this time.

520
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,947
But you know what?
I'll be with you until the end.

521
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:10,248
And if you want to go ahead on
against Pablo, just say so.

522
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:16,124
We'll find strong allies. And people.
We'll need a lot of people.

523
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,555
Yes.

524
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:28,968
You're right.

525
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,071
Yes.

526
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:39,307
I think we have to see things
for what they are.

527
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,681
The truth of the matter, just as it is.

528
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,183
And this is the truth, Berna.

529
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,020
I know of someone who's very powerful.

530
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,356
Someone who wants to kill Pablo
as much as I do.

531
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:07,673
Alleys run along the house here
and here.

532
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:10,510
We'll keep the other car
waiting around back.

533
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:14,176
- You sure it's not a trap?
- I'm not sure of anything.

534
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,119
- Murphy.
- Hey, it's me.

535
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,060
Hey, honey...

536
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:27,962
I'm just in the middle of something.
Let me call you right back.

537
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,327
We're at the airport.

538
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,167
You're where?

539
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:34,364
I can't do this.

540
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,868
I'm taking Olivia
and we're going back to Miami.

541
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,501
No, no, no. Listen to me, please.

542
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:42,171
Please, you can't just do it like this.
You can't.

543
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:45,911
My sister's offered to help us out for
a while, so we'll be there if you need us.

544
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:50,314
It's not right, Steve, to keep Olivia here
with everything that's going on.

545
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,083
Not when I can take her someplace safe.

546
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,887
You're safe in Bogotá. You're right beside
the goddamn fuckin' embassy.

547
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:57,360
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Look, I have to go.

548
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:01,422
Connie, please. We can talk about this.
Do not get on that airplane. Wait, okay?

549
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,829
I'll be right there. I'm on my way.

550
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,495
I'm sorry.

551
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:10,503
Hey, hey, hey. I'm here. Okay?

552
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:14,935
- She's at the airport.
- Go.

553
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:18,346
I'm sorry. I gotta go. Guys, sorry.

554
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,081
All right.

555
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:56,781
Hello, Fernando.

556
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,060
You did very well, sister.

557
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,893
Look, you don't just get two,
you get three.

558
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:14,427
You have a special talent, and that's why
you get three instead of two green ones.

559
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:25,007
What are you doing tonight, sweetie?
I know of a nice calm place.

560
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:27,483
We could have fun.

561
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:31,912
I can't.
I have to take care of my daughter.

562
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,127
- Bitch. Give me 30 minutes, Limón.
- All right, brother.

563
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:42,258
I'm going to fuck one of them.

564
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,633
Sweetie...

565
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,205
Thank you, Maritza.

566
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,173
Bastard.

567
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,707
Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!

568
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:33,717
- Flight to Miami.
- Gate 39, but... Sir, you can't go. Sir!

569
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:35,308
I'm DEA. I need to get on this flight.

570
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,549
I'm sorry, sir. Sir, I'm sorry,
but the plane has already left.

571
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,859
Sir, please. You can't be here.

572
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:46,754
Sir!

573
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,934
Right here, to the right.
It's the next right.

574
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,441
Know the area well, don't you, Peña?

575
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:00,409
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

576
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,206
Just fuckin' drive.

577
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:34,306
Enjoy.

578
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:46,084
Get you feeling pretty good?

579
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:50,426
Oh, fuck. Thanks, man. Shit.

580
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:55,994
You wouldn't imagine
what a kilo of that stuff cost.

581
00:43:57,268 --> 00:43:58,463
Come on.

582
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:01,231
- How about you, golden boy?
- What are you talking about, man?

583
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,837
Time it's processed, shipped,

584
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:10,938
distributed to your buddies on
the Upper East Side? Yeah.

585
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:14,417
Hey, man, we don't need
any problems here. We cool?

586
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,324
Six.

587
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:25,830
Lives.

588
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,962
That's how much it cost.

589
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,762
What do you think about that?

590
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:34,499
That was six people.
Six people were murdered

591
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:38,098
every time you
and your buddy over there...

592
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:41,343
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah?

593
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:07,829
Yeah? You like that? Yeah?

594
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:14,470
There's the taxi. Park on the left. There.

595
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,320
Calm down! Calm down!

596
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,654
Okay, let's go.

597
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:32,251
All right. Wait for me here.

598
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:56,219
- Trujillo!
- Go around! Go around!

599
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:58,051
Move! Move! Move!

600
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:01,859
Move! Move! Move!

601
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,223
Quica!

602
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:05,421
Brother!

603
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,520
God damn it. What?

604
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,726
- Quica! Quica!
- What's the problem, brother?

605
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,598
Let's go, brother. Hurry up!

606
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,301
Brother! Hurry, Quica!

607
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:48,399
They're cops, brother! Run!

608
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:02,578
That way.

609
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,182
Stop looking.
This is the best place to eat.

610
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,725
Fuck.

611
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:50,724
Fuck.

612
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,835
The situation is that...

613
00:47:58,743 --> 00:48:03,647
your escape has left us without...
We don't have a lot of options.

614
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,513
If I hadn't escaped,
they would have killed me, Fernando.

615
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:10,586
Or I'd rot in an American jail.

616
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:17,559
- You will tell Gaviria...
- Gaviria is being crucified by the media.

617
00:48:18,763 --> 00:48:21,095
I don't think it's a good time.

618
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:27,066
You will tell Gaviria...

619
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:36,704
I am willing to go back to La Catedral
to finish my sentence.

620
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:38,340
As you wish.

621
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,413
- Tomorrow morning, I'll return to Bogotá.
- No, no, no, brother.

622
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,517
We can't...

623
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:53,527
leave for tomorrow what we can do today.
Right?

624
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,375
Mr. President,
Mr. Fernando Duque is on the line.

625
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:11,873
- I don't have anything to say to him.
- I'll handle it. You go ahead.

626
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:16,918
Mr. Duque. Eduardo Sandoval speaking.

627
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:21,049
Mr. Vice Minister, I have an important
message from Mr. Escobar.

628
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:27,988
He says he's willing to negotiate the
conditions for his return to La Catedral.

629
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:32,258
Turn on the television.

630
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:43,241
- What did he say?
- He told us to turn on the television.

631
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,263
Good evening, compatriots.

632
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:13,766
In the last year and a half, we've
enjoyed the peace we'd long awaited...

633
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,175
for over a decade.

634
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,179
Now we can go to work,

635
00:50:19,283 --> 00:50:23,948
drop our children off at school,
and enjoy life's small pleasures...

636
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:29,049
without the threat of violence
looming around every corner.

637
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:34,156
This peace is now threatened
by virtue of Pablo Escobar's escape.

638
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:40,364
Escobar has been named
the bloodiest narcoterrorist of all time.

639
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:45,703
This history changes today.

640
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,736
But I need your help.

641
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:54,818
We must come together as a people,
as a country,

642
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:58,253
so his reign of terror comes to an end,
here and now.

643
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:02,983
This is why I'm before you now...

644
00:51:03,928 --> 00:51:08,729
offering a reward of $1.4 million

645
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:12,496
for whoever gives information
leading to his capture.

646
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:18,267
It is my hope that through this reward...

647
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:23,547
the day will finally come when our country
is free of Pablo's grip

648
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:29,348
and will cease to be held hostage
by terror, intimidation...

649
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,279
and murder.

650
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,721
I want to make it very clear...

651
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,784
that under no circumstances...

652
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:41,631
will I negotiate with Pablo Escobar.
