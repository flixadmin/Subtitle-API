1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:06,223
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,098
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,938
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,271
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,894
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,985
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,280
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,619
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,122
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,290
We got Turtle locked up
in the pipeline.

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,793
All we got to do is use him to figure out
how to steal Zoom's speed.

12
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,829
That might take longer than we thought.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,542
- Why's that?
- Because Turtle's dead.

14
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,878
You need to figure out
what triggers your vibes.

15
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,506
Sometimes it's when I touch
something that belongs to a breacher,

16
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,091
sometimes itjust happens.

17
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,296
There's always a cause.

18
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,052
We're going to help you save Jesse.

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,514
What? You want me to leave everything
I have here? I mean, my life?

20
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,146
You don't have a life here anymore.
Zoom is too powerful.

21
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,897
Close it! Close it now!

22
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,480
No!

23
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:01,771
Jay's death was not in vain.

24
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,314
We will meet Zoom again.

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,233
And the next time, I will beat him.
Whoever that monster is.

26
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,333
Whoo-hoo!

27
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,467
Uh... It didn't look this deep on the map.

28
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,009
That's 'cause maps are flat.
This is like 1,000 feet deep.

29
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,757
Well, you wanna get faster,

30
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,472
maybe plummeting to your death
is the motivation you need.

31
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,305
So, to reach escape velocity,
you're gonna have to go...

32
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:39,808
That fast.

33
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,736
Well, that fast is impossible.
I can promise you that.

34
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,316
Uh-uh! Uh-uh!

35
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,273
"Nothing in life is promised
except death."

36
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,826
- Edgar Allen Poe?
- Kanye West.

37
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,449
If it makes you feel any better,

38
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,206
Evel Knievel cleared a line of cars
that was twice this long,

39
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,616
and he didn't even have super powers.

40
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:59,086
Ah, unless you count that sweet-ass ride.

41
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,376
- Do you hear yourself?
- Well, look,

42
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,000
you're gonna be fine. I'm 80% sure of it.

43
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,213
- Okay.
- 76.

44
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,636
Like, a strong 72. I can't stop.
Caitlin, help.

45
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,591
If you don't feel ready,
you probably shouldn't do it.

46
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,018
- Not helpful.
- Look, Zoom's still out there.

47
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,222
And once I find a way back to Earth-2,
I have to be faster than him.

48
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,023
And I mean, right now,

49
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,605
I wasn't even fast enough to save Jay.

50
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,688
I have to try.

51
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,096
He's going to make it.

52
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,520
- No.
- Oh, damn.

53
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,532
"Why'd you have to bring those drones
along, Cisco?"

54
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,793
"Oh, I don't know."
You're welcome, everyone.

55
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,802
Time projects include
releases of solo albums.

56
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:38,265
Pop music would never be the same
after Beyoncé left Destiny's Child.

57
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,640
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.

58
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,931
D0 they mean Senator Knowles?

59
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,646
- Scooch.
- What?

60
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,527
Oh, how'd it go?

61
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,276
Well, he's not a red splat
on the side of a mountain.

62
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,824
- That's our new definition of success?
- Lt's one of them.

63
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,872
- So, you didn't make the canyon jump?
- Nah-uh.

64
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,536
What else can we try?

65
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,705
A bigger canyon?

66
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,002
Okay, fine, no more canyons.

67
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,381
I know I can crack this,
I've just been going about it wrong.

68
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,836
I need to find my leg up.

69
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,251
Have we factored in drag?

70
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,132
- Wells, can we re-run the simulation?
- Let it go for now.

71
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,172
Zoom's still out there.

72
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,598
He's terrorizing a whole world
full of people. Yourworld.

73
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,101
I'm not doing this for fun.

74
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,928
Barry, we've been working on this
all week.

75
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,430
You're tired. We're tired.

76
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,272
Yeah. What we need is some downtime.

77
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,861
Downtime leads to increased productivity,
ergo we have to have fun.

78
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,112
And the best way to have fun
is for us to go out to the club.

79
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,365
Am I right? Team Flash. Let's get turnt.

80
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,947
No, but seriously. We need a break.

81
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,281
You know, I think Cisco's right.

82
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,371
And if I'm saying we need a break,
then you know it's serious.

83
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,457
All right then. Let's go out tonight.

84
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,797
Oh, yeah. Can I go?

85
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,460
Over my dead body.

86
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,546
Look, just 'cause you're stuck in this lab
all day doesn't mean I should be, too.

87
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,802
Over my rotting corpse.

88
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,342
Look, what happened to trying new things,
meeting new people?

89
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,893
You said
I should start a life here, right?

90
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,603
And Zoom's over there and we're over here.

91
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,272
So, there's nothing to worry about.

92
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,474
There's always
something to worry about.

93
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,604
Okay. Well, you said Barry and them are
good people and I should get to know them.

94
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,324
- I did.
- Yeah.

95
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,326
And you know they'll keep me safe,
no matter what.

96
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,997
Look, I have a life to live, Dad,
and a whole world to explore. Please?

97
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:23,865
Please?

98
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,668
- Fine.
- Yes.

99
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,716
But if you're gonna go,
you should take protection.

100
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,593
Oh, uh...

101
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,924
Dad, I don't need...

102
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,423
I don't know what you thought
I was gonna be doing, but I...

103
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,935
Oh, right.

104
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,854
I mean, is it necessary?
It's kind of, you know...

105
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,355
Or I can always build you
an inescapable daughter cube.

106
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,811
Funny.

107
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,316
You know I'd get out, though, right?

108
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,824
All right, fine.

109
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,442
I'll do it.

110
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:01,903
Thank you.

111
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,855
Oh, God, sorry. It keeps doing that.
My dad made me wear it.

112
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,015
Don't worry about it. It's all good.

113
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,811
I'm really glad you came, Jesse.
Even though this place is less than ideal.

114
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,150
Hey. Toast?

115
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,154
To Jay.

116
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,493
I wonder what Jay would say
if he was here right now.

117
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:46,202
"What's a Kamikaze?" And then you'd spend
10 minutes explaining it.

118
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,491
And he'd say, "Just kidding,
we have those on Earth-2."

119
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,502
Yeah, well, we don't have those, so...

120
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,537
Hey, uh-uh! I'm sorry, Miss Underage.

121
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,082
None of us plan on getting murdered
by your father tonight.

122
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,216
- Oh, whatever, he's all talk.
- Mmm-hmm.

123
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,595
- Yo, guys, what's up?
- Hey.

124
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:02,930
Glad you could make it.

125
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,384
- What's up, Wally?
- Hey.

126
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,344
Interesting choice of venue.

127
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,679
- The tic-tac-toe theme is cool.
- Barry picked it.

128
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,063
For real?

129
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,601
Yeah, I picked it. I don't go out much.
It had four stars on Yelp, so...

130
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,686
- Okay, fair enough.
- So, who's this?

131
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,360
This is Wally. He's my...

132
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,529
Foster...

133
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,277
Step, adopted...

134
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,321
This is Wall... He's my new friend.
This is Jesse.

135
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,123
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

136
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,909
So, Jesse, are you new in town?

137
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,419
Uh, yeah. You could say that.

138
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,501
Yeah. Me, too. Are you from far away?

139
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,127
Like you wouldn't believe.

140
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,717
Oh, uh...

141
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,966
You know what? Would you just excuse me?

142
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,303
Uh, I Just need to go powder my watch.

143
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:52,139
Hey, so I know
I'm practically your brother

144
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,442
and I'm, like, half Jay's size, but uh...

145
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,732
- You wanna dance?
- Sure.

146
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,403
Come on. Let's go.

147
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,323
Stupid watch.

148
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,835
All right, buddy,
you have beeped your last beep.

149
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,000
Something else rising also.

150
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,799
Some dark instinct

151
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,428
about what I would do to the person
who had taken you.

152
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,467
The things I would do...

153
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,231
So, how's Wally doing?

154
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,450
Yeah, he's good.
He's just diving into his schoolwork.

155
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,448
- Good. I'm glad.
- Yeah.

156
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,906
Oh, God.

157
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:01,587
Promise me, if we ever do get married,
you will not do that dance at our wedding.

158
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,634
Oh, I can promise you that.

159
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,513
Not the wedding, the dancing.

160
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,841
What?

161
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,853
I don't know. I Just think it's weird
that we're married in the future

162
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,435
and on Earth-2.

163
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,645
I wonder what our married doppelgangers
are doing tonight?

164
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,156
Probably Earth-2's equivalent
of Netflix and chill.

165
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,360
Sounds nice. I mean, for them.

166
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,085
- Who was it?
- It was the Flash.

167
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,343
My wallet's gone.

168
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,716
Someone took my purse.

169
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,900
And who the hell are you?

170
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,164
Okay, I got it. Thanks, man.

171
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,704
- Hey. Excuse me.
- Hey.

172
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,453
What happened last night?
I know you didn't rob these people.

173
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,166
No, I was bored.
Just thought I'd have some fun.

174
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,463
Well, look, whoever did this,

175
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,341
they got everyone within a 10-block radius
in under six minutes.

176
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,589
You couldn't catch him?

177
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,215
No, this speedster's faster than me,
I guess.

178
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,137
Unbelievable. Hey, babe.

179
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,215
Hey, so I spoke to that girl over there.

180
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,680
She snapped a photo of the red blur.

181
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,304
- Look familiar?
- This is not good.

182
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,646
I know. It looks exactly like the photo
I took of you last year.

183
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,569
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.
We always do.

184
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:45,903
Hey.

185
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,522
Oh, it's work. I gotta go.
Keep me posted, okay?

186
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,736
Yeah.

187
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,401
Joe, I don't want people thinking
the Flash is a petty thief.

188
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,530
Well, we need to get to work
squashing those rumors before they spread.

189
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,874
Here it is, people.
Evidence that the Flash has gone rogue.

190
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,204
Couldn't it be
the speedster in the helmet?

191
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,248
The photo speaks for itself,
no helmet glare,

192
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,921
confirming that
this is the Scarlet Speedster.

193
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,460
We're going to expose him as a fraud.

194
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,466
McKay, lwant you
at the police department,

195
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,131
getting any interview you can.

196
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,720
- Okay, on it.
- Williams,

197
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,016
eye-witness encounters.

198
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,682
The people of this city
need to know what it feels like

199
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,643
to be robbed by a hero.

200
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,691
West. I want you to do a piece on it.

201
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,944
From your perspective. You were there
last night, and you've seen him in action.

202
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,822
Okay, but why would the Flash need to
make off with a couple of hundred bucks

203
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:33,406
when he's saved so many lives?
I mean, he is, actually, a hero.

204
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,363
Iris, you're a smart woman.
You can't be that naive.

205
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,033
We live in a city full of meta-humans
who continually do whatever they want.

206
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,288
The Flash included.

207
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,494
Write it up.

208
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,959
His journey from streak to freak.

209
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,380
Due on my desk tomorrow.

210
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,730
So, fun night?

211
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,991
Before all the chaos broke loose?

212
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:22,125
That I would do anything to get you back.

213
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,668
Including killing a man.

214
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,881
Tell me I'm not hearing this right.

215
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,422
No, that's true.

216
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,760
Zoom had you.

217
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,813
Zoom needed the Flash's speed.

218
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,687
And it was him or you.

219
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,313
And I was not going to lose you.

220
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,360
You know, you were my hero.

221
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,868
My dad, the brilliant scientist,

222
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,869
who could accomplish anything
he put his mind to.

223
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,202
Who taught me I could never dream too big.

224
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:02,745
But now?

225
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,377
Now you're a killer.

226
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,755
- And I barely recognize you at all.
- Jesse...

227
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:09,914
No, no, no, don't.

228
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,799
Don't worry, I'm not going far.

229
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,388
And where did this speedster
even come from?

230
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:18,715
I don't know, man.

231
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,760
All I know is, that blur made
60 smackaroos off of me.

232
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,052
Ridiculous.

233
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,763
Maybe it's another one of
Zoom's henchmen somehow?

234
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,139
The breaches are closed.

235
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,230
The only other way to become a speedster's
from a particle accelerator explosion.

236
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,566
Okay, but then why only
make yourself known now?

237
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,232
You see what I'm saying? We would've
had to seen them in action before.

238
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,615
I'm not saying it makes sense.
I'm just saying,

239
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,443
that's the only other way
to become a speedster.

240
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,283
Actually, there's another way.

241
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47,919
It's called Velocity-Nine.

242
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,710
Ooh, it's a sexy-ass name. What is it?

243
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,123
It's a speed drug.

244
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,427
Jay took it when you were on Earth-2
to save the city from a meta-human.

245
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,003
What?

246
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,636
- How could you not tell me this?
- I promised Jay I wouldn't.

247
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,510
Jay? What do you... Why?

248
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,269
Because Jay knew
how dangerous this drug is.

249
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,976
I should know, Barry.
Snow and I worked on it together.

250
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,155
Guys, I've been busting my butt out there,

251
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,947
pushing myself to the limit,

252
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,114
trying to get better, trying to be faster,
and you're telling me

253
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,783
That there's been something
this whole time that could've helped me?

254
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,284
This could've helped me take down Zoom.

255
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,582
It could've helped me save Earth-2 Joe.

256
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,622
- Save Jay.
- Jay was sick.

257
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:33,419
The drug he took to regain his speed
was also causing cellular degeneration.

258
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,466
It was killing him.

259
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,754
I tried to help. I tried to find a cure.

260
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,305
But in all my experiments,
the effects were just temporary.

261
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,217
The V-Nine is deadly.

262
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,767
Why not tell me this?
Why keep me in the dark?

263
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,685
Caitlin...

264
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,310
Where am I?

265
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,030
- Are you okay?
- Did you vibe?

266
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,119
Uh...

267
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,372
Meta-human.

268
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,667
Yeah. Social media app for the win.

269
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,127
Bad Flash is back.

270
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:19,840
Bad Flash.

271
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,013
Ugh, what? No. Losing my touch over here.

272
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,568
He's coming up on Fifth and Everett.
You can use the alley to cut him off.

273
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,044
A lady speedster.

274
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,179
It only took us two years,
but we finally got one.

275
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,635
A lady speedster.

276
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,644
Hey, here's a question for you.
Purely scientific. Was she good looking?

277
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,390
Yeah, I was a little busy
getting my ass handed to me,

278
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,229
- so I didn't really notice.
- Right, right, right.

279
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,068
But you know, next time, for science?

280
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,396
Okay, yeah.
Next time she punches me in the face,

281
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,360
- I'll be sure to get her number.
- There you go.

282
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,733
But the question remains, who is she?

283
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,360
I have no idea.

284
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,990
We could run her
through the facial recognition.

285
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,243
- She had a mask on.
- What was her suit like?

286
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,207
- Hey.
- Hey, it's a valid question.

287
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,284
It is, actually.
How was her suit constructed?

288
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,454
I, uh... lt was good. lt was very good.

289
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:42,591
It was like mine. It was made by somebody
who understands the needs of a speedster.

290
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,222
So, that would be someone
with access to tech and a lab.

291
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,600
Oh, no, I'm having a very bad thought.

292
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,473
When I designed V-Nine,

293
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,893
I was having trouble
reformatting the extracellular matrix.

294
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,444
So, I called a colleague of mine
at Mercury Labs for some assistance.

295
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,025
Eliza Harmon.

296
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,773
She knows how to make this speed drug?

297
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,784
No. I followed the protocols
of information compartmentalization.

298
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,695
I only gave her
three of the eight components

299
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,329
necessary for V-Nine's structure.

300
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,581
Okay, so she didn't have the full recipe?

301
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,038
Unless she reverse engineered
her own V-Nine.

302
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,537
Eliza's a genius.
But that's way out of character for her.

303
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,630
- Well, it's worth taking a look.
- I'll go see her.

304
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,458
Hey, I'm coming, too.

305
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,589
Great. I'm gonna go train.

306
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,608
Knock, knock.

307
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:49,369
Am I hallucinating or is that disgraced
ex-Mercury's employee, Caitlin Snow?

308
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,747
Eliza Harmon, burning the midnight oil.
Don't you ever take a break?

309
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,579
Well, you know what they say, these
thiocyanate ions won't bond themselves.

310
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,576
- Hi.
- Hi.

311
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,626
Who is your handsome friend?

312
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,665
Detective Joe West, ma'am.

313
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,880
Detective, what brings you around
these parts?

314
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,635
Well, it's a funny story.

315
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,505
You know how there's a speedster
that's been wreaking havoc on the city?

316
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,466
Yeah. I heard the Flash went nuts.

317
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,013
Fame will do it to you.

318
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,893
I guess some people
just can't handle the limelight, right?

319
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,688
Well, we happen to know
it was someone else.

320
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,682
That's why we're here looking into this.

321
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,819
Wow! How very Law & Order of you, Caitlin.

322
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,405
Do you remember that formula that you were
helping me with a few months ago?

323
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,114
- Uh, yeah, vaguely.
- We think that it was somehow involved.

324
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,949
How? What did you have me working on?

325
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,878
It's classified, but let's just say
it was some kind of enhancement.

326
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,588
And we're afraid
that my research was stolen.

327
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,382
Not from this lab?

328
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:50,551
Okay, uh, between you and me,
the place is pretty vulnerable.

329
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,715
Ever since that break-in a few months ago,

330
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,684
some of us think McGee
hasn't sufficiently stepped up security.

331
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,432
But I kept my research on lock

332
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,393
and destroyed the originals
when it was given back to you.

333
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,187
But, hey, you're free
to look around my lab if you want.

334
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,940
Uh, I don't think that'll be necessary.

335
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:07,859
I'm sorry. lwish I could be more help.

336
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,157
It's okay. It's actually kind of a relief.

337
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,030
Will you call me
if you hear anything, though?

338
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,911
Of course. That's what friends are for.

339
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,913
Thank you.

340
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,755
- So, what do you think?
- For now? We take her at her word.

341
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,050
West. How's your article coming?

342
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,889
Um, great.

343
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:42,065
I have a source who knows for a fact
that this speedster is not the Flash,

344
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,774
but an imposter.

345
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,272
Ah. Who's your source?

346
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,112
I am not at liberty to say.

347
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,115
Well, if you can't tell me your source,
I'm running the original story.

348
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,492
Uh, wait, wait, wait.

349
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,956
You're right. What's one unnamed source
compared to dozens of eye-witnesses.

350
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:03,457
Honestly, I'm having a hard time
wrapping my head

351
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,459
around your vision for this story.

352
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,835
Something isn't adding up.

353
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,427
How about we, um, talk about it some more?

354
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,889
Uh, grab some coffee, what do you say?

355
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,349
Coffee? Right now?

356
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,103
Yeah, yeah. I mean, a little caffeine
never hurt anybody, right?

357
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,139
Sure.

358
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,117
I'm so tired.

359
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,502
Well, you've been
pushing yourself too hard.

360
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,124
No, not hard enough.

361
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,834
I'm sick of always being passed over
for the grant, for the promotion.

362
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,262
I'm underpaid and understaffed
and six months behind on my research.

363
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,223
That's why I started all of this.

364
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,263
Your problem is
you're too much of a perfectionist.

365
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,182
You don't have to be.
There's beauty in chaos.

366
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,096
Okay, I don't have time for chaos.

367
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,016
This was supposed to fix things,
and it ended up making it worse.

368
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,605
Oh, silly girl.

369
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,437
You know it makes you feel better
to blow off some steam.

370
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,734
You will say anything for a fix.
It's your fault we're hooked.

371
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,033
It's Caitlin 's fault.

372
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,986
If she didn't want us to find out
what she was working on,

373
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,988
she shouldn 't have made it so damn easy.

374
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,055
There's not enough for both of us.

375
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,723
We need to save it for an emergency.

376
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:40,966
You take it now.

377
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,845
Worry about getting more later.
You'll thank me.

378
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,869
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

379
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,087
I know what's best for us
and where to get more.

380
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,436
Whatcha doing?

381
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,108
- Training.
- Training.

382
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,861
Allen, don't be stupid.

383
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,705
I know you took the V-Nine, Allen.

384
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,033
- No, I haven't.
- Oh, no?

385
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:51,462
No. I took it. Butl haven't taken it yet.

386
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,414
- Good.
- Tell me why I shouldn't.

387
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,295
Figure it out.

388
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,970
If the game is already rigged,
why can't I level the playing field?

389
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,172
I mean, if everybody else is cheating,
how can...

390
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,517
I want to be fast enough to stop Zoom

391
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,974
and any speedster
that tries to hurt my friends.

392
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,107
Shouldn't I use everything in my power
to do that?

393
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,354
You wanna take a shortcut?

394
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,063
Is that right? You wanna take a shortcut?

395
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,732
Remember this, you lose

396
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:20,317
a chunk of your humanity every time
you compromise your values.

397
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,159
I'm sorry.
That's really good coming from you.

398
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:27,740
So, don't be like me.

399
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,246
Be better.

400
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,662
Be like Jay.

401
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,565
Are you okay?

402
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,935
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

403
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,195
Hey, any luck locating our speedster,
since Eliza checked out?

404
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,034
Um, I'm still working on it, but...

405
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,411
Hey!

406
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:17,373
Time to have some fun.

407
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,514
Hey! Cisco!

408
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:29,761
Hey, Joe!
Hey, she's got me in the pipeline!

409
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,320
- What do you want?
- Where's the V-Nine, Caity? I need a fix.

410
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,401
Eliza, is that you?

411
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,408
Eliza's not here right now.
My name is Trajectory.

412
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,656
Oh, why do the crazy ones
always name themselves?

413
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:54,285
Look, Eliza, Velocity-Nine
is very dangerous, okay?

414
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,919
It made a friend of mine very sick.

415
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,043
And he already had the Speed Force in him.

416
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,249
- Look, your cellular...
- Enough.

417
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:05,255
You are boring me to death.
Hand over the V.

418
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,674
I'm a physician. I took an oath.

419
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,138
I can't give you anything
that will hurt you.

420
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,104
Right. So, either hand over the V
or the cat guy gets it.

421
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:15,389
No!

422
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,947
Hey, move, now.

423
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,787
Look, all the flasks are gone.
There's nothing left.

424
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,334
Hey, I was really hoping
you wouldn't make me do one of those

425
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,462
"I have to kill you each, one by one,
until you give me what I want."

426
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:39,705
Oh, well.

427
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,123
Wait.

428
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,133
Wait.

429
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,012
You want V-Nine,

430
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,596
- we'll make it for you.
- Dad, you can't.

431
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,803
We have all the ingredients.

432
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,644
I'm not a patient person,
so better move fast.

433
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,693
Aw!

434
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:15,913
Ah, latte for me. And a Flash for you.

435
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,285
Wow, this guy even gets a drink
named after him.

436
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:19,996
Yes, he does.

437
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,919
He saved a lot of people's lives.
They just want to show their appreciation.

438
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,004
A little too much if you ask me.

439
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,424
Why can't you see what everyone else sees?

440
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,464
A few years back,

441
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,720
I won the
Dornfeld Award for Investigative Reporting

442
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,556
for my story
on corruption in the mayor's office.

443
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:39,060
I investigated a man that everyone loved.

444
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,526
The mayor was young, telegenic,
a former war hero.

445
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,568
He was voted in with
overwhelming popular support. It was...

446
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:52,403
But I knew that his campaign was
bought and paid for by the mob.

447
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,952
Okay, but not everyone is a corrupt mayor.

448
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,543
But I saw him for what everyone else
was too blind to see.

449
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,541
Everyone wants a hero.

450
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,006
Yeah, but in this case the Flash
actually is one.

451
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,550
Iris, Iris, it's our job to...

452
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,588
To ensure that people, even heroes,
are held accountable for their actions.

453
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,345
So, I'm guessing,

454
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,813
on your list of dating pros and cons,

455
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,725
being anti-Flash is a major deal breaker.

456
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:25,565
Um, dating pros and...

457
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,023
Did you think that this...

458
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,483
Oh, what? No, no. No.

459
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,652
Forget what I said. I get it. You just...

460
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,821
Uh, wanted to talk about the...

461
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,156
Story some more...

462
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,792
To stall.

463
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,249
Right? Because you're trying to get out of
writing this article altogether.

464
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:52,759
Scott, wait, please don't leave.
I'm sorry. I didn't know that this was...

465
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,892
Why would you? Excuse me.

466
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,108
This is what you wanted.

467
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:15,786
Now let her go.

468
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:23,085
How do I know the two of you didn't lace
this with a sedative to put me on my ass?

469
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,795
Wouldn't do that.

470
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,376
Hmm. Can never be too safe, right?

471
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,583
- No.
- No!

472
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:39,969
Thanks for the fix, Snow.

473
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,939
Get Barry. Are you okay?

474
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,104
- Well, good job on the cell, Cisco.
- Jesse.

475
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,398
What happened?

476
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,821
- Turn her on her side.
- Eliza shot her up with V-Nine.

477
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,577
- She's going into shock. It's too pure.
- Stay with me, Jesse. Stay with me.

478
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:58,950
- What do we do?
- We got to get the V-Nine

479
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,864
- out of her system.
- She needs a blood transfusion.

480
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,825
The new blood will flush
the drug out of her system.

481
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,206
- What blood type is she?
- P-Zee negative.

482
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,212
Yeah, that's not a thing
on this Earth, man.

483
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,580
I'm a match.

484
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,292
Jesse.

485
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,357
Hey.

486
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,066
What happened?

487
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,869
We... You're fine. Your...

488
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,242
You're going to be fine.
We got the drug out of your system.

489
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,240
Oh...

490
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,784
Looks like you saved the day again.

491
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,670
Look, honey,
I know that this isn't enough.

492
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,884
I promise you, though, I am...

493
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,922
I'm going to spend the rest of my life
making it up to you for the...

494
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,721
For that terrible thing that I did.

495
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,136
- Yeah?
- Yes.

496
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,607
And how many more terrible things
are you going to do to protect me?

497
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,695
What does that mean?

498
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:20,077
I mean, everything that you do
and everything that you have done for me,

499
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,368
it's so dark, and you don't even see it.

500
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,374
I mean,
you didn't even hesitate out there.

501
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:30,333
Of course not,
I'm not going to lose you, Jesse.

502
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,214
Okay, but you just gave that
crazy speedster everything she wanted,

503
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,839
without even blinking.

504
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:40,719
Without even thinking
what other lives could be at stake.

505
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,475
It's myjob to keep you safe,
to protect you.

506
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,679
That's myjob. That's all that matters.

507
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,434
Well, maybe it shouldn't be.

508
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,398
Caitlin, I know she was your friend
and all,

509
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,826
but, uh, home-girl has gone cuckoo bird.

510
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,781
And now she's out there with more V-Nine.

511
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,201
What she doesn't know
is I put a micro-tracker in the drug.

512
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:06,615
Mmm, that's a brilliant idea.

513
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,165
You can run, but you can't hide.

514
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,922
I'm the one to blame for all of this,
so I need to help fix it.

515
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,800
There's plenty of blame to
go around, Snow. What's her location?

516
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,801
- Central City bridge.
- Why is she running back and forth?

517
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,798
Villains gonna vill.

518
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,264
- She's creating friction.
- At that vibration and speed...

519
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,766
- What?
- Complete chaos.

520
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,392
She could destroy that whole bridge.

521
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,520
And everyone on it.

522
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,015
Guys, this bridge is coming down.

523
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,679
Barry, there's about 200 people
on that bridge right now.

524
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:21,440
Okay.

525
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,781
You're ruining all my fun.

526
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,207
No.

527
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,545
Trajectory is too far away. You won't get
to her running across the river.

528
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,052
I will if I jump.

529
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,262
Barry, to make that jump,
you'll need to go...

530
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:51,512
Mach 3.3. But only for a second.

531
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,895
Okay.

532
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,962
Yeah, buddy.

533
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,149
It's over, Eliza.

534
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,244
It is never over.

535
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,617
Wait, hey.

536
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,116
Stop doing this to yourself.

537
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,452
You don't actually want to hurt anyone.

538
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,422
You don't know anything about me.

539
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,457
No, I know you're not a bad person.

540
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,634
This is the V-Nine in your system.

541
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,637
I also know what it feels
like to want to be the best.

542
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:13,135
Makes you feel like there's not enough
time to accomplish things the right way,

543
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,436
but it's a cop-out.

544
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,769
And this is killing you.

545
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,104
Look at yourself, Eliza, you're not well.

546
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,822
Let us help you, please.

547
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,219
That is all the help I need.

548
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,682
How does it feel to know
that I am faster than you will ever be?

549
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,770
- See you around.
- Her lightning...

550
00:34:58,722 --> 00:34:59,974
It's turning blue.

551
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,857
Your article was well written.

552
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:45,894
Thank you.

553
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,439
You know, it's a lot easier to write
when it's the truth.

554
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,909
Not every hero is a fraud.

555
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,865
It's okay to believe in them.

556
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,531
So I've been told.

557
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,829
And sometimes, even greatjournalists,

558
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,254
smart and brilliantjournalists,

559
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,250
can misread situations.

560
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,720
And sometimes,
they can be caught off guard.

561
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,471
Look, about the other night,
itjust surprised me,

562
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,888
but once the surprise went away...

563
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,402
Not a deal breaker.

564
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,235
Noted.

565
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,918
- Hey, have you seen Jesse?
- No.

566
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,813
Hey, Dad.

567
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,733
It's me.

568
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,147
Listen.

569
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:16,405
Your job over the years
has been to shield me from harm.

570
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:21,327
But now, it's my turn to go out
into this new world on my own,

571
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,998
no shield,

572
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,702
and discover what this Earth can offer.

573
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,881
You know,
you are the best teacher I've ever had,

574
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:34,632
but I don't know
what more you can teach me.

575
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:37,388
Ilove you.

576
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,509
Please don't come looking for me.

577
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,074
So, Eliza just evaporated?

578
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:01,988
From running too fast?

579
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,791
It looks like cellular degeneration.
The same as Jay's.

580
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:08,207
Jay warned us V-Nine was dangerous.
At least now, we know why.

581
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,207
- You find Jesse?
- She went out.

582
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,054
Barry, what is it?

583
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,261
Just right before Eliza

584
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,681
disappeared, her lightning,
it turned blue.

585
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,262
Right.

586
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,894
But what if it's a side effect
of the V-Nine?

587
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,356
Yeah, but Jay took Velocity-Nine
and his lightning didn't turn blue.

588
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,777
But how fast was he running?

589
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,734
Not as fast as Eliza.

590
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:39,284
All right, so what if V-Nine
is what turns your lightning blue?

591
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,408
I mean, that would explain why
Zoom is so much faster than me.

592
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,622
If that's true,
then that means he's sick, right?

593
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,161
He's dying.

594
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,750
That's why he wants your speed.
He's dying and he needs a cure.

595
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,925
Same as Jay.

596
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,798
No.

597
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,846
Jay? No.

598
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,767
He died right in front of us.
Zoom killed him right in front of us.

599
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,179
Yeah, Cisco, we've seen a speedster

600
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,023
be in two places at once before.

601
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,274
I guess there's one way to find out.

602
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:21,652
I guess now would be a good time to
tell you all, I've been vibing Zoom.

603
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,449
What?

604
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:25,989
For how long?

605
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,496
It started when we closed the last breach.

606
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,042
And every time it's happened,
I've been near that thing.

607
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,524
We need to know.

608
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,544
No.

609
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,256
No, no.

610
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,513
Cisco? What did you see?

611
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,317
I saw Jay.

612
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,562
He's Zoom.

613
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,172
Barry!

614
00:40:58,196 --> 00:41:06,196
