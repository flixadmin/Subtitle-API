1
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:13,782
Malekith.

2
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,659
Asgard's forces are upon us.

3
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,688
Send in the Kursed!

4
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,641
Their deaths will mean our survival.

5
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,103
This war is far from over.

6
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,803
The Aether awakens us.

7
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,432
The Convergence returns.

8
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,524
Look upon my legacy, Algrim.

9
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,736
I can barely remember a time
before the light.

10
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,657
Our survival will be your legacy.

11
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:49,288
The Asgardians will suffer
as we have suffered.

12
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,622
I will reclaim the Aether.

13
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:51,957
I will restore our world.

14
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,751
And I will put an end
to this poisoned universe.

15
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,968
The worlds are nearly aligned.

16
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,142
You will be the last of the Kursed.

17
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,937
Let my life be sacrificed.

18
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:45,607
It is no less than our people did,

19
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,442
or you have done.

20
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,202
You will become darkness,

21
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:02,123
cursed to this existence
until it consumes you.

22
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:11,258
Until then, no power our enemies
possess can stop you.

23
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:21,142
I will tear down their defenses and
ensure your return to a universe reborn.

24
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:11,021
Heal. You will need your strength
to reclaim the Aether.

25
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:15,109
And when you wake,
we will kill them all.

26
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:24,392
We must strike now.

26
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:26,436
No.

28
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:33,693
Asgard is meaningless.

29
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:39,824
The Aether has found its way home.

30
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,753
He is an enemy of Asgard.

31
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:10,589
He was a prisoner in their dungeons.
