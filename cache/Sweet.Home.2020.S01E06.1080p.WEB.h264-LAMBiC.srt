ORIGINAL STORY SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,306
SEPTEMBER 2000

3
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,307
Why did you do it?

4
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,193
Who are you?

5
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,819
Why did you do it?

6
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,866
-You've grown a lot.
-Answer me.

7
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,372
It was just a prank.

8
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,624
Don't come!

9
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,002
Don't come, Sang-wook!

10
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,837
I didn't think that would happen.

11
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,138
It would've been nice
if it had rained like this that day.

12
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,057
Don't you agree?

13
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,980
Don't show up again.

14
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,608
I was already punished.

15
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,362
…sentenced to 11 months in prison
and 2 years of supervised probation.

16
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,498
Who decides that?

17
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,126
Who decides that?

18
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,429
I hear you kill people for money.

19
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,473
Do you also find people?

20
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,725
JULY 2020

21
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,728
I asked him where my daughter was.
He said she was here

22
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,272
and gave this to me.

23
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,190
The bastard that kidnapped my daughter.

24
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:34,821
Look at her smiling because
she doesn't realize anything.

25
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:38,074
She asked him to take a nice picture
since it's for me.

26
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,248
I was going to buy pesticides with this.

27
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,500
I have no will to live.

28
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,671
Then just die.

29
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,512
But how can I?

30
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,557
That son of a bitch is still alive
and running around freely,

31
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,684
but I don't know where my daughter is!

32
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,061
Why are the police stopping me? Why?

33
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,688
How is that the law?

34
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,273
How?

35
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,817
How is that the law?

36
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,073
How is that the law?

37
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,867
Please find her.

38
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,162
Please find her.

39
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,624
You're the only one I can turn to now.

40
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,132
Please find her.

41
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,259
Please…

42
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,595
What is this?

43
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,145
Son of a bitch…

44
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,397
That man's a murderer!

45
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,316
I was already punished.

46
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,026
How is that the law?

47
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,528
How is that the law?

48
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,701
You fucking murderer.

49
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,595
Don't touch me.

50
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,447
Take care of the rest on your own.

51
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,421
GUARD ON DUTY

52
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,834
Nobody's going to take it.

53
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,046
Gosh.

54
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,214
You scared me to death.

55
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,134
I'll pick it up for you, so give me that.

56
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,846
Give you what? My liver?

57
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,812
Are you really going to be like this?

58
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,607
Can't I even look at it?

59
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,281
You can only look.

60
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,162
I'll be watching you.

61
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,292
Do you have any left?

62
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,256
There's enough.

63
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,484
Shouldn't we kick him out?

64
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,444
For what reason?

65
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,863
For catching a murderer?

66
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,782
He didn't catch him. He killed him.

67
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,284
It was self-defense.

68
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,537
Yun-jae that bastard deserved to die.

69
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,664
If it weren't for that thug,

70
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,666
-one of us would've--
-So what?

71
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,918
He's still a murderer.

72
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,671
He might kill again. You never know.

73
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,216
It could be any one of us…

74
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,531
Thank you.

75
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,423
Right now, this is all I have…

76
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:52,823
I think I'll be joining Yun-a soon.

77
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,747
If you're still looking for her,

78
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,833
please stop.

79
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,588
I hope you're safe.

80
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,135
Thank you very much.

81
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,979
Why are you burning money?

82
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,108
I was paid to do an errand.

83
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,821
I failed.

84
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,867
Why am I here?

85
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,672
I'm sorry.

86
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,882
I saw the text message.

87
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,723
I THINK I'LL BE JOINING YUN-A SOON.

88
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,474
Not everyone agrees,

89
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,311
but you can stay if you want.

90
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,775
I don't think what you did was right.

91
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,195
But you did what you had to do.

92
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,825
FROM 7,800 WON

93
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,250
Can anyone…

94
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,006
pray?

95
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,804
Yes, of course.

96
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,314
You do it.

97
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:50,941
Why me?

98
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,870
Because God probably likes you
more than me.

99
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:02,972
Help!

100
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,111
This is just great.

101
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,031
Have fun.

102
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,457
Are they really siblings?

103
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,042
Was she adopted or something?

104
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,754
Let's call it a day.

105
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:18,798
Good work.

106
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,343
-Lower it.
-Okay.

107
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,553
Slowly.

108
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,459
JUNE 2020

109
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,086
Are you finished?

110
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,755
Yes, I checked it thoroughly

111
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,299
because I like you.

112
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,095
How is the condition?

113
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,973
Well…

114
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,059
It's pretty okay for such an old building.

115
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,604
When do you get off work?

116
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,565
Let's have dinner together.

117
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,033
I wish we could.

118
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,333
Do you only go home to Seoul once a month?

119
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,003
They're working you too hard.

120
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,921
I'm sorry.

121
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,344
What can I do?

122
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,639
You look sexy when you work,
so I'll let it slide.

123
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,808
CHIEF PHYSICIAN NAM SANG-WON

124
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,021
What's "Crucru"?

125
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,940
Is it your blog? It's logged in.

126
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,317
Hey, Yi-kyung.

127
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,401
Well…

128
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,236
When is it?

129
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,488
Our wedding photo shoot?

130
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,865
What?

131
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,117
What's this? You're acting suspiciously.

132
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,202
-What?
-What are you hiding?

133
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,079
Did you write you don't want
to get married?

134
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,123
No, it's nothing like that.

135
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,084
Yi-kyung.

136
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,671
It's nothing like that. Yi-kyung.

137
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,599
You do as you please, don't you?

138
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,310
Please leave.

139
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,771
What?

140
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,649
What are you saying?

141
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,443
We need your help, a firefighter's help.

142
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,947
But you seem preoccupied.

143
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,158
Thanks for telling me to leave.

144
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,828
No, Yi-kyung.

145
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,666
-You shouldn't.
-There's something I need to do.

146
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,547
Thanks for everything.

147
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,978
You look better as a monster.

148
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,234
So becoming a monster is your dream?

149
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,486
Why do you try so hard?

150
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,822
I work hard at everything.

151
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,409
When monsters do show up,

152
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,828
we'll all be killed.

153
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,289
Trying hard won't stop that.

154
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,958
I look forward to your turn.

155
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,754
Me? I won't do it. Do you think I'm crazy?

156
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,465
Yes. You're a crazy bitch.

157
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,385
That's why you'll end up doing it.

158
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,971
And you'll work

159
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,764
even harder than me.

160
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,125
Gosh, my precious baby.

161
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,336
Don't ride it too hard.

162
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,588
Be gentle!

163
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,063
Why did you poke your nose in?

164
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,815
To pay off a debt.

165
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,109
What do you mean?

166
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,029
Why would you pay it off with my bike?

167
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,706
God isn't like that.

168
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,670
He doesn't just listen to the prayers
of those He likes more.

169
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,221
What are you trying to do?

170
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,474
Soju is too bitter if you drink it alone.

171
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,646
And you end up drinking too much.

172
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,153
I used to be an alcoholic.

173
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,698
I'm desperately resisting
the urge to drink.

174
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,247
I realized that
what you see isn't everything.

175
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,457
People,

176
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,584
the world,

177
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,296
and God's will, too.

178
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,973
I fought by praying.

179
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,350
I'm sure you had your own method.

180
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,311
You're in charge of this place now.

181
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,190
Why would I do that?

182
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,193
Try to fight in a different way.

183
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,655
This is a good place to be alone.

184
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,284
Oh, right.

185
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,493
Now that you're in charge…

186
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,538
Save the rest of that.

187
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,720
You're cheating.

188
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,724
Stop playing with toys.

189
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,851
Read a book.

190
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,812
I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE DARK

191
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,272
Well,

192
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,566
Yeong-su can't read yet.

193
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,279
Hey,

194
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,365
kids your age in Gangnam
can speak Chinese.

195
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,330
Open the book.

196
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,709
All right.

197
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,544
I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE DARK

198
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,339
-"I'm

199
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,382
not afraid

200
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,676
not afraid

201
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,180
-of the

202
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,681
dark."

203
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,351
You try.

204
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,354
-"Dark."
-"Dark."

205
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,355
Again.

What? My name isn't on it.

212
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,001
Mine isn't on it, either.

213
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,257
You can be my buddy.

214
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,175
With you?

215
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,135
Yes.

216
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,929
Because…

217
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,604
we're secret agents.

Green Home rules of survival.

219
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,574
One. Move in groups of two or more.

220
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,413
Report anything unusual immediately.

221
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:38,505
Two. Eat once a day.
Only the prescribed amount is distributed.

222
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,801
What is this?

223
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,929
You call this a rice ball?

224
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,974
It should be at least this big.

225
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,827
Thirty-six point six.
Your temperature is normal.

226
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,711
What about that dog? Can't it change, too?

227
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:23,425
Three. Check everyone's temperature
every night at 8 p.m.

228
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,279
Thank you.

229
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,623
Quarantine the infected.

230
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,173
Did you shut down the elevator?

231
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,218
We're running out of power
and it's dangerous,

232
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,053
so we'll run it in case of emergency only.

233
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,722
What we're doing to Hyun-su,

234
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,016
is it right?

235
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:59,020
He didn't harm anyone. We aren't sure
if he'll turn into a monster.

236
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,939
-Locking him up like that--
-It isn't right.

237
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,609
I know, but Hyun-su is dangerous.

238
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,033
He's dangerous, but we need him.

239
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,325
ROOM 702 SUNSCREEN
ROOM 1009 DOG FOOD, CHARGER, SANITARY PADS

240
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,832
Damn, why's he only on my case?

241
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,584
Well…

242
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,504
It's sad to see it go to waste.
Plus, we need the bottle. So…

243
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,132
You're so immature.

244
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,219
When do you think Hyun-su will be back?

245
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,930
I don't know. He's late today.

246
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,975
-Do you think something happened to him?
-You know he doesn't die.

247
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,979
Even if he gets hurt,
he gets better after a nap.

248
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,206
-Where is it?
-Where?

249
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,625
Come here!

250
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,835
-It's going to come this way.
-Hurry.

251
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,129
-Let's go.
-Now!

252
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,385
What is it?

253
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,512
-Hold this.
-Oh God.

254
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,017
It's my husband.

255
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,814
I have to do this.

256
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,150
-Wait.
-Stay still.

257
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,820
-No.
-Seon-yeong.

258
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,114
Seon-yeong.

259
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,247
Pull yourself together, Kim Seok-hyeon.

260
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,045
Kim Seok-hyeon.

261
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,297
Pull yourself together!

262
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,105
You're back.

263
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,277
Do you have any last words?

264
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,241
Please…

265
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,576
kill…

266
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,745
me…

267
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,628
And…

268
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,451
You'll end up like this, too.

269
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,917
EXIT

270
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:39,147
You said it for the first time
in 30 years.

271
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:46,154
I'm sorry…

272
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,743
Why did it have to be now?

273
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:39,040
JULY 2020

274

00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,007
Hurry!

276
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,184
I'm Seo Yi-kyung
from Sujeong Fire Station.

277
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,061
-Hurry!
-She's the bereaved family member.

278
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,439
-I'm sorry for your--
-His body…

279
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,150
hasn't been found.

280
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,487
Please give permission
to preserve the scene. I'll find it.

281
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,739
I cannot give permission.

282
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,199
You're a firefighter, so you know…

283

285
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,291
From now on, I'm just the bereaved.

286
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,921
-You must find him at all costs.

It's not a disease. It's a curse.

297
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,518
I was consumed by it, too.

298
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,522
It's been ten days since I began
to have nosebleeds and fainting spells.

299
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:11,692
They talk to me and ask questions,

300
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,736
but I'm still resisting them.

301
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,824
I have to be a subject myself
and solve this phenomenon.

302
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:20,993
Fifteen days.

303
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,247
Subjects enter a stable period
after 15 days.

304
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,832
If I hold out

305
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,417
for five more days,
I'll become a special infectee.

306
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,380
One thing is for sure.
Studying someone who survives

307
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,675
the monsterization symptoms
is the only method we have.

308
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,928
It's the last hope to end
this nightmarish disaster.

309
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,837
The power is out.

310
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,214
Let's wait a little, Ji-eun.

311
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,758
It'll be okay.

312
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,385
How do you know?

313
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,053
It's obviously not okay.

314
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,930
What's going to happen now?

315
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,892
I hear we're almost out of food.

316
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:29,312
The water will be cut off soon.
I'm scared.

317
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,479
Su-yeong,

318
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,565
are we going to die?

319
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,362
It's over.

320
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,073
We're all doomed!

321
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,619
I really hope I go to Heaven after I die.

322
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,538
So?

323
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,916
So what?

324
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,585
Do you want to commit mass suicide
since we'll all die soon?

325
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,423
Stop whining!

326
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,052
Whining won't change anything.

327
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,859
It's okay.

328
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,911
People are getting agitated.

329
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,704
I know.

330
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,957
It's sooner than I expected.

331
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,461
Electricity has no direct impact
on survival.

332
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,882
Having no drinking water
is a more serious problem.

333
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,682
You must be happy
because you're so cool-headed.

334
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,021
Be honest with me.

335
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,565
Do you think we can survive?

336
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,128
What are you?

337
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:18,921
I don't know.

338
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,965
What?

339
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,842
I don't know what I am.

340
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,012
You can just start over here.

341
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,931
You can live however you want.

342
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,143
And if I reveal my desire,
I become a monster?

343
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:36,689
That's right. Now tell me what you want.

344
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,528
Fuck you.

345
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,199
Fine.

346
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,410
Good luck, then.

347
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,666
BASTARD

348
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,876
Are you up?

349
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,422
I knew you were a pushover.

350
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,467
Being a doormat is in your blood.

351
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,345
But I was wondering, Hyun-su.

352
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,140
Who did that?

353
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,520
-I did.
-I mean,

354
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,440
why did you do it?

355
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,693
Because of me.

356
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,366
It's not because of you, moron.

357
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,953
Does it make you feel better
to think that way?

358
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,374
That's why everyone blames you.

359
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,750
You have to throw

360
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,711
a huge fucking fit

361
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:41,921
to make people understand.

362
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,677
Doesn't it hurt?

363
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,180
No.

364
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,725
You were groaning miserably earlier.

365
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,657
I don't know where you were hurt,
so stick these on yourself.

366
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,286
I don't need them.

367
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,996
-I'll recover--
-Make it obvious.

368
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:19,708
"I got hurt because of you.
It fucking hurts!"

369
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,626
Get it?

370
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,631
Why don't you get it?

371
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,389
BAND-AID

372
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,278
Leave him alone.

373
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:51,031
If it's that important, you go yourself.

374
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,284
-Stop.
-Hey!

375
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,910
You're the worst.

376
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,164
You act like you care,
but you just stand by and do nothing.

377
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,374
-You're no different.
-What about you?

378
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,210
All you do is run your mouth.

379
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,505
You fucking bitch.

380
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:08,841
Hey, Eun-yu.

381
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:11,427
Stay out of it.
You aren't even my real brother.

382
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,061
You're fucking unbelievable.

383
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,409
DO NOT ENTER

384
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,376
We have to go outside.

385
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,837
There's no guarantee we'll be safe here.

386
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,007
Nothing happened
when we retrieved the corpses.

387
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,260
The situation might've calmed down.

388
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,765
So?

389
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,934
It's…

390
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,522
taking you longer and longer to recover.

391
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,482
We don't know
when you'll turn into a monster.

392
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,652
You think…

393
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,531
I'll hurt you guys if I become a monster?

394
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:22,581
There are monsters that don't hurt people.

395
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,666
So?

396
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,378
Can you be sure you'll be like them?

397
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,139
A monster is a monster.

398
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,687
We don't have time.

399
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,648
We must find a way to survive
while you can still resist.

400
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,873
I don't expect you to understand.
Just do your job.

401
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,126
You're just being used.

402
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,589
You'll end up like this, too.

403
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:35,404
Tell me.

404
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,115
Where is Sang-won?

405
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,199
No.

406
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,329
What did you do to him?

407
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,168
You're not in a position to ask questions.

408
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,544
Tell me!

409
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,175
You read this. He must be dead.

410
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,010
Whether he killed himself or got killed.

411
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,638
I HAVE TO BE A SUBJECT MYSELF
AND SOLVE THIS PHENOMENON.

412
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,765
Even if he's not dead,

413
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,892
I don't think you could say he's alive.

414
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,031
Now it's my turn to ask.

415
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:22,076
What and how much do you know?

416
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,247
I know you'll kill me.

417
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,708
Why do you think so?

418
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:33,671
If I know too much, you'll kill me
to shut me up.

419
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,384
If I know nothing, you'll kill me
because I'm useless.

420
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,177
But…

421
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,850
I have to live no matter what.

422
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,436
How?

423
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,981
Get a grip.

424
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,402
You're looking for someone
resisting monsterization, right?

425
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,489
I know where one is.

426
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:28,619
I think it's asleep.

427
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,247
Let's not wake it up.

428
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,696
Help!

429
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,411
-Mr. Han!
-Su-yeong, it's dangerous!

430
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,038
Run!

431
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,011
Mr. Han!

432
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,278
