1
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,962
This afternoon at 5100.

2
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,087
Il Duce will speak to the nation!

3
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,088
You are ordetred
to turn your radios on!

4
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:52,218
All of you who have radio sets
and radio gramophones...

5
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,564
are ordered to turn them on.

6
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:59,481
Mussolini will speak to

7
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,229
all Italians!

8
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,066
You are authorized by order
of the Fascist government...

9
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:11,322
to interrupt your work. This afternoon at 5200...
ll Duce will speak to the nation.

10
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:16,703
I was twelve and a half
when I saw her for the first time.

11
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,288
And my mind plays tricks on me,
I remember it well.

12
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:23,550
That day, Mussolini declared war
on France and Great Britain...

13
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,589
and I got my first bicycle.

14
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:31,215
The frame is British, the gears are German,

15
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:34,095
the pedals are French,

16
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:38,224
and the brakes are from...
I forget.

17
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,693
But the chain is Sicilian...
always keep it greasy.

18
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,232
Are you sure it's safe?

19
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:45,071
I have new bikes too.

20
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:49,611
Mimi, we're at war.
Who can afford a new bicycle?

21
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,080
Fightingmen,

22
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,119
on land, on sea and in the air,

23
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,251
Black shirts of the revolution,

24
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,629
men and women of Italy...

25
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,007
and the Kingdom of Albania, hearth is...

26
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,702
The hour...

27
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,036
of decisions from which

28
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,422
there is no return.

29
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,210
Pino, think this ant knows he's dead meat?

30
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,336
Who knows?

31
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,343
If he's like you, he doesn't know shit.

32
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,467
The declaration of war...

33
00:02:55,967 --> 00:03:00,347
has already been delivered
to the ambassadors.

34
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:22,499
I'm free from misery.
Mary's son is my Lord.

35
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,840
Hey, guys!

36
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,971
Lucky bastard.

37
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:37,092
- He got a new bicycle!
- Man, she's beautiful!

38
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,854
Custom-made, just like the racers.

39
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,771
- Now you're a man, like us.
- So I can join the gang?

40
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,023
- "Don Agostino"?
- Okay by me.

41
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,863
- "Don Nicola"?
- I'd let him in.

42
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,115
- "Don Tonino"?
- Sure.

43
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:57,284
- And you, "Don Sasa"? - l don't want
some kid poking into our business.

44
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,286
- Why? What are you doing?
- Can you keep your mouth shut?

45
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,292
She's coming!

46
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,174
What's going on?

47
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:18,266
If you wanna be one of us,
just shut up and watch.

48
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,689
- Who is she?
- The daughter of the deaf guy, our new Latin teacher.

49
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,275
What's her name?
What a wonderful ass!

50
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,381
What I wouldn't give for an hour with her!

51
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,515
- Too bad she's married.
- If she weren't...

52
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,137
What's her name?

53
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:31,267
Malena, the most beautiful ass
in Castelcuto.

54
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,241
The sun is bigger than the moon.

55
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:44,283
“Sole magnum est quam lunam.”

56
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,908
Or “Sol maior est luna.”

57
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,002
Can I screw your daughter,
you deaf old fart?

58
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,413
Yes, but hurry.

59
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:57,418
I love honesty more than wealth.

60
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:03,015
“Magis diligo onestatem quam divitias.”

61
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:07,644
Or “Magis diligo onestatem divitiis."

62
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,339
- Seven thumbs long!
- Seven and a half thumbs!

63
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,465
- Mine's a bazooka!
- L got eight!

64
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:48,592
Eight is nothing!
That's just tickling a woman.

65
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:52,223
One, t_wo... three and tw_o is_ five,
two ls seven and two ls nlne.

66
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,724
Torpedo!

67
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,981
My submarine will rip Malena in half!

68
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,197
Once I skipped school
and went by Malena's house.

69
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:05,361
She was at the window,
and she called out to me.

70
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:09,573
I thought she wanted me
to get her some cigarettes.

71
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,576
I went up for the money,
and her robe fell open.

72
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:17,122
And there she was...
naked as the day she was born.

73
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,124
Holy shit! She did it
on purpose to excite me.

74
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:24,086
I was an idiot.
I should have jumped at the chance.

75
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,512
If it happens again,
I'll bang her brains out.

76
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,387
She'd quit smoking first.
She knows you've got no balls.

77
00:08:31,388 --> 00:08:35,562
You little runt, you've been
here for two hours...

78
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,684
and you still haven't measured yourself.

79
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,936
Measure it!

80
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,905
One, two,

81
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,193
three, four, five...

82
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,694
Only six!

83
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,577
You know what they say
about a kid in short pants?

84
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,541
Short pants! short dick!

85
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,456
Fuck off. My thumbs are
twice as big as yours!

86
00:08:56,457 --> 00:08:57,705
Bullshit!

87
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,340
- Who's got the biggest dick now, runt?
- You do!

88
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,554
No, I am ll Ducze!
Nobody's bigger than me!

89
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,431
- Ooh. Renatds skipping school.
- Shh!

90
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,741
You, come_here!
I need some cigarettes.

91
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,884
What cigarettes do you want?

92
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,925
Macedonia Extra.

93
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,573
I remember this suit very well.
It's your father's.

94
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,665
I sewed it 2O years ago,
and it still looks brand-new.

95
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,703
He only wore it to his wedding.
He wants to keep it for his funeral.

96
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:05,207
If he's buried in this suit,
he'll go straight to heaven!

97
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,708
My father's still young.

98
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:10,087
And you're too young
for long pants.

99
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,339
I didn't ask for your opinion, sir.

100
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,842
- Does he know about this?
- Of course he does!

101
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,561
You little scoundrel,
what the hell is this?

102
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:23,599
Come here, mister.
So you want to skip school?

103
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,103
Fine. Who didn't at your age?

104
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,105
- Leave him alone!
- L know what I'm doing.

105
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:35,238
And you let your friends beat you up.

106
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:39,832
Even though when I was your age,
I'd beat my friends up!

107
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:44,462
But stealing trousers from your father...

108
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:48,842
and getting them altered for yourself
is just plain wrong.

109
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,255
But, Papa, you don't understand!

110
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,471
Understand?
Who said you could speak?

111
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,974
I'm ashamed to wear short pants!

112
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,134
What about knickers?
They're almost long pants!

113
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,102
Enough!
He's still a child!

114
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,896
I'll tell our party secretary you won't
let me go to the Fascist exercises!

115
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,740
Let's make a deal.

116
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:18,121
The day someone cracks the skull
of "Our Great Leader,"

117
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,158
then you'll get long pants.

118
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,534
Swear it.

119
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,949
A beautiful young woman
all alone here. It's a cnme.

120
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,078
- Who's he talking about?
- Malena Scordia, Nino's sexy new wife.

121
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,161
She must have somebody
on the side... it's inevitable!

122
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,287
- Number fifteen!
- Me.

123
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,962
Right. Nino brings her from
her village with her ailing father.

124
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:21,088
And then a month later...
boom... Nina's called to the war.

125
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,844
Who here wants to bet
she's sleeping all alone?

126
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,800
Not me!

127
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,055
Why don't you let me
sit with the others?

128
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,185
You're too young to sit
in the adult chair.

129
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:49,695

141
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,725
But, son, if you don't know
the title, how can I help you?

142
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,015
It's that pretty, romantic one...

143
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,860
Ma L'Amore No.
Why didn't you say so?

144
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,114
Ten lire.
Pay at the cashier's.

145
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,608
- Don't you test it?
- What for?

146
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,782
- It might be defective.
- It's brand-new!

147
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,633
Miss Malena, this heart of mine,
on fire, has written so many letters,

148
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:45,059
and if I didn't have the courage
to send them to you,

149
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,936
it was only because
I didn't want to do you harm.

150
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,186
So forgive me if I dare
to send you this one.

151
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,318
I want you to know that
this town has many gossips...

152
00:21:55,439 --> 00:22:00,193
who say bad things about you...
that you have a secret lover.

153
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,696
I know it's not true.
You don't have anyone.

154
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:07,702
After your husband,
the only man in your life is me.

155
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,620
I have to go.
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

156
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,621
So long!

157
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,457
Don't get lost!

158
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,207
Mr. Lawyer!
Your newspaper's upside down!

159
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,677
Mind your own fucking business!

160
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:36,317
Good morning, Signora Malena.
Are you well? How is your father?

161
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:12,262
The show's over!
She's gone now!

162
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,284
I forgot the key.

163
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,466
So it's true what people say!

164
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,715
What's the matter with you?
You look so strange.

165
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,284
You've poisoned me with your lies.

166
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,348
What lies?
I've never spoken to you.

167
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:40,975
I knew it from the start...
you're a loose woman.

168
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:44,187
But I've never done anything wrong.

169
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,315
Liar! I've been following
you on my bicycle!

170
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,692
- I know where you went. I know everything!
- No!

171
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,991
- The lawyer, the dentist!
- No, Renato, I love only you!

172
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,705
Liar!

173
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,336
- Amoroso.
- Here!

174
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,500
- Cali.
- Here!

175
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,248
- Costanza.
- Here!

176
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:08,253
Professor, can I put my dick
between Malena's tits?

177
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,721
Can I put mine in her mouth?

178
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,847
Can I put mine
between her legs?

179
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,634
Okay, but one at a time!

180
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,520
Do you spit instead of oiling it'?

181
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:31,154
No. I use cooking oil.

182
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,675
If you come, I will give it to you.

183
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,908
Used machine needs oil, fool.
Or grease, which is better.

184
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,787
Do you know grease?
Keep over the chain slippery!

185
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:52,263
Why didn't she marry
someone from her own village?

186
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,926
I'm sure no one wanted her.

187
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,810
They say she's a seamstress.

188
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,024
But she's so vulgar.

189
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,152
My son says she looks fake.

190
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,200
My husband says he wouldn't touch
her with a ten-foot pole.

191
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:21,918
The Bayon Bonta_'s mistress
ls much nlcer.

192
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,327
At least Gina does everything
in the open.

193
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:28,083
The baron screws her once a week
and then goes back to Palermo.

194
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,090
Malena acts so superior.
Like we don't know what she's up to.

195
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,179
Wait and see.
She'll get hers.

196
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,396
The headquarters of
the armed forces communicates...

197
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,148
Our brave and invincible Fightingmen
have delivered a powerful blow...

198
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:34,274
to the faceless war machine
unleashed by the Allies.

199
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:38,653
In order to ensure the continued
strength and vitality...

200
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:43,874
of our forces at the front,

201
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:49,539
all payment of civic pensions...
will again be postponed...

202
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,547
- it's ready.
- Thank you.

203
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,966
You will go blind!

204
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,263
Malena.

205
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,635
Right rank!
Eyes front!

206
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:30,856
Armsput, arms hjgh,
In qulck succession!

207
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,268
One, two! One, two!

208
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:38,982
Have you heard?
Malena's husband was killed.

209
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,115
Malena is available!

210
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,390
Comrades of Castelcuto,

211
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:16,058
we are gathered here today...

212
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:20,439
to share in the tragic
but honorable mourning...

213
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,942
which has struck our town.

214
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,527
To express our deepest condolences...

215
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,281
for the loss of Lt. Nino Scordia...

216
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:34,204
heroically killed in action...
in Northern Africa...

217
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,582
and to his bride Maddalena,

218
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:42,168
who, stricken with grief,
unfortunately isn't here with us.

219
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:46,800
- She's already out looking!
- She'll need a warm bed now!

220
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,220
But she is with us in spirit,
because Sicilian women...

221
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:54,348
with their hardships,
with their sacrifices,

222
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,726
march shoulder to shoulder
with Fightingmen!

223
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:06,451
The mertyrdom of our fellow citizen in defense
of hls country was not a useless sacrifice.

224
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,321
Lt. Cadei is so handsome.

225
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,743
A lucky girl will catch him!

226
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,250
That will carry us to the
final victory of the Fascist Empire!

227
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,507
For Victory!

228
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:29,599
Long live ll Duce!

229
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,017
From now on I'll be at your side.

230
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:00,889
Forever. I promise.

231
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,234
Just give me time to grow up.

232
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,033
Now she'll take a lover for sure.

233
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,162
Once in the sack,
there's no looking back!

234
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,165
She knows that. She's 27 years old.

235
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,333
She knows her way
around the block!

236
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,169
Cusimano, the dentist,
has gone crazy for her.

237
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,342
One day he was distracted
ass he walked by...

238
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:17,468
and pulled a healthy tooth
instead of the rotten one!

239
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,726
Dentist or not, why haven't
we seen her lately?

240
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,975
Guess she's too busy!

241
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:31,070
They say she's fooling
around with a shopkeeper in Catania...

242
00:36:31,071 --> 00:36:32,611
with subversive tendencies.

243
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,991
Some say Cusimano, the dentist.

244
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:40,491
- A family man. It's disgraceful!
- When you're a born whore...

245
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:45,462
I hear the priest has received
anonymous letters...

246
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,998
saying her lover
is this man, that man.

247
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,926
The voice of the people
is the voice of God!

248
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,415
I can't talk to anyone about
my personal problems.

249
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:28,412
They're too intimate.

250
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,633
But you seem nice.
I'd like to confide in you.

251
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,548
Every day,
I'll light a candle for you.

252
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:45,304
I'll even come to Mass on Sunday.

253
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:49,560
But you must protect
Malena Scordia from the town.

254
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:53,314
Yes, the widow... at least for
a few years. Then I'll take over.

255
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,840
Don't you like the movie?

256
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,620
I am always at your service.

257
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,871
- Renewed condolences, Malena.
- Condolences.

258
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,509
What a piece of ass!

259
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,602
Son of a bitch!

260
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,004
You little runt!
Come back here!

261
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:33,918
- Can't you sing in Italian?
- Can't you speak German?

262
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,435
I cannot live without my life.

263
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:59,309
I cannot die without my soul.

264
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,065
Renato, It's late.

265
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:08,447
Renato, get up.

266
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:18,294
Monster!

267
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,581
You're a fetishist,

268
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,958
a sadomasochist,
or even worse, a pervert!

269
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,962
- What is that?
- It's just a French hat, Ma!

270
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,057
Shame on you!

271
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:36,430
Shame on you!
Can I keep this?

272
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:42,857
What are you looking at?
Get out of here!

273
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,604
Come here, you little pig!

274
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,982
- Goddamn pervert!
- What did I do?

275
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:54,490
You're not permitted to sit
at the table with us, understand?

276
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,208
- Answer me!
- Okay!

277
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:04,333
You no longer have the right
to speak to your sisters, understand?

278
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:08,007
Lock me up!
I'll show you!

279
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:12,223
You're not to leave this room
until further notice!

280
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:17,015
Son, at least have some soup.
It will do you good.

281
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,263
Pietro, he hasn't eaten
for three days.

282
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:24,110
In the Soviet Union,
they never eat.

283
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,396
Still... What is this shit?

284
00:43:26,397 --> 00:43:30,525
The Fascists gave it to us.
At least it looks like coffee.

285
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,527
Sure, and I look
like Vittorio De Sica.

286
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:35,529
Everything they give us is terrible!

287
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,659
Look at these pockets.
They're always ripping open!

288
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,286
This cheap thread
doesn't hold the stitches!

289
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,287
The thread isn't the problem!

290
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,666
While our son recites poetry,
his hands go to work in his pockets!

291
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:49,545
What does that mean?

292
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,296
Do you get it now?

293
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,429
Just <i>as</i> well! Don't fix them.
Sew the pockets closed!

294
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,510
But he'll have no pockets.

295
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:01,139
He'll work it out.
It will be good for his health!

296
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,518
Lights out!

297
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:11,157
That the weary spirit may
never repose in more restful harbor...

298
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,444
- Has he gone crazy?
- L think he's gone blind.

299
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,956
While upon women's work
you sat intent,

300
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:26,331
content with the vague future
you held in mind...

301
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,070
was the scented May, and thus
you used to spend your days.

302
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:34,087
This child needs air.

303
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,307
- Air?
- Air.

304
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,837
Good morning, Professor.

305
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,012
This letter is for you.

306
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,515
It says "urgent."

307
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:39,863
You're dishonored. Your daughter
Malena is sleeping with the whole town.

308
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,175
It was an anonymous letter,
but I read it!

309
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,019
It s_ays Malena ie a whore
with everyone In town!

310
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,431
So there's hope for us too!

311
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,059
Take it back!

312
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,779
I'll bust your ass,
Mr. Short Pants!

313
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:57,235
Tonight was wonderful.

314
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:02,738
- For me too.
- L know it's been only ten months since.

315
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:06,708
- But maybe I can see you again.
- All right. You win.

316
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:10,124
- Tomorrow.
- Okay, as long as I'm not on duty.

317
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,924
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You're welcome.

318
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,511
Take care of yourself.

319
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:37,270
So see you tomorrow?

320
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,397
Yes.

321
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:42,152
- Until then.
- Good night, Leone.

322
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,530
What time?

323
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:51,411
- Good evganing, sir.
- Good evenmg, my ass!

324
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:55,790
How dare you pester my fiancee!

325
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:59,044
There must be a misunderstanding.
I was invited.

326
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:01,262
You're a liar and a bastard!

327
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:04,800
Because I'm in_unifor_m,
I can not retaliate, slr.

328
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:08,053
- But you will answer to me.
- Anytime.

329
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:14,275
- Coward, scoundrel!
- Get up.

330
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,440
Come here!
I'll tear you apart, you coward!

331
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,689
I'll break you in two!

332
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,035
Let me go! Or I'll have
to get tough with you!

333
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:30,450
- Here's the adulterer!
- My wife!

334
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,828
- Officer, look! He's cheating on me!
With a man?

335
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:37,210
With a traitor!

336
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,838
You said you wouldn't touch her
with a ten-foot pole!

337
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:40,964
It's the dentist.

338
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,682
I've been spying on you
a long time, you bastard!

339
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:49,094
And as for you,

340
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:52,597
go steal husbands from
your own wllage, you whore!

341
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:06,486
We knew she had one lover, but two?

342
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:09,698
But where does
the dentist fit in?

343
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:11,244
He fits in between her legs!

344
00:49:11,245 --> 00:49:15,245
Her father was forced
to quit the school in disgrace.

345
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,248
He never wants to see
his daughter Malena again.

346
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,626
And the dentist's wife
kicked him out of his house.

347
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:27,255
That dragon of a wife
will drag him into court!

348
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:30,601
What's the dentist
got to do with it, Door guy?

349
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,892
Malena's the whore!
She should be taken to court!

350
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:36,891
That Lt. Cadei seemed
like such a gentleman.

351
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:39,269
How could he get mixed up in this?

352
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:42,772
Everyone knows
she's a home wrecker.

353
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,151
The lieutenant was asking for it!

354
00:49:45,152 --> 00:49:48,403
- She's not from here. She forgets where she is.
- Will they go to court?

355
00:49:48,404 --> 00:49:54,407
Of course, she could go to jail.
He's a married man!

356
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:59,005
The dentist needed
three stitches in his head.

357
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:02,542
But the dentist
swore at the soldier first.

358
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,668
That's insulting an officer.

359
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,047
We'll all end up in court!

360
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,173
While we were
watching her caboose,

361
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:13,553
the lieutenant and the dentist
were riding the train!

362
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,625
She's either going
to the lawyer's or the notary's.

363
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,629
Sure, but what will she do
with two old men like them?

364
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:33,637
- Excuse me.
- Come In.

365
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,634
Can I help you?

366
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,354
May I speak to Lawyer Centorbi?

367
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:41,269
Please have a seat.

368
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,646
Sir, it's the widow Scordia!

369
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,650
Can it be true?
Beautiful Madonna!

370
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,166
Have her come in.

371
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,293
- Go in.
- Thank you.

372
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,292
Please sit down.

373
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,169
Charmed.

374
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:19,520
We now continue with the testimony
of Maddalena Bonsignore,

375
00:52:19,521 --> 00:52:22,811
the widow Scordia called Malena.

376
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,189
She could get two years in prison.

377
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,693
Everything will be fine, trust me.

378
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:38,948
Sit down.

379
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:51,214
You're accused of_ involving
Dr. Gaspare Cuslmano...

380
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:55,090
in a secret and
amorous relauonshnt)...

381
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,433
aimed at the breaking up
of his family.

382
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,470
Do you know Dr. Cusimano?

383
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,596
Yes.

384
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:07,606
Are you or have you ever...
been his fiancee?

385
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:10,188
Absolutely not.

386
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:12,857
How could I be engaged
to a married man?

387
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:16,734
Why was Cusimano.
At that unusual hour...

388
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,861
on his way to your house?

389
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,079
I don't know.

390
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:24,335
Had he bee_n in your pompany
on previous evenmgs?

391
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:42,227
Yes, once.

392
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:49,860
Where?
- At my house.

393
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:59,744
Jumped right in, the dentist did.
He looks stupid, but...

394
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:05,376
- How long did he stay?
- Not long.

395
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:06,535
What did you do?

396
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:11,165
He brought me some medicine
for my father.

397
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:17,047
If it was for your father,
why did he bring it to you?

398
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:18,422
I don't know.

399
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:23,769
What did you do after
he gave you the medicine?

400
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:26,059
He said good-bye and left.

401
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:34,397
Then why has Cusimano,
are put able professional,

402
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:36,397
who, five years ago...

403
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:40,448
had the honor of extracting
one of ll Duce's teeth...

404
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:42,697
publicly declare
that he is your fiance?

405
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:47,326
He made that up.
I had nothing to do with it.

406
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:49,203
Your husband's crazy.

407
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:54,300
What kind of relationship
did you have with Lt. Cadei?

408
00:54:57,085 --> 00:55:02,342
I'm a widow. My business
and that of Lt. Cadei...

409
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,685
are no concern of the law.

410
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:10,353
All right.
Did you know that,

411
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:14,354
as a result of these affairs,
Lt. Cadei was transferred to Albania?

412
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:15,195
One down.

413
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:19,075
And before his departure,
he was questioned in judicial inquiry.

414
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,325
Clerk.

415
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:22,953
He declared to have encountered

416
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:27,490
the widow Scordia only twice...
in her home.

417
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:31,962
And to have had
no amorous relationship...

418
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,459
considering their relationship
"just a casual friendship."

419
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:41,471
Son of a bitch.

420
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:45,638
Lt. Cadei was received by my client...

421
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:50,265
and she makes no secret
about having had for him...

422
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:53,017
certain feelings.

423
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:56,645
But unlike the married Cusimano,

424
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:01,776
who was, let's face it, guilty...

425
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:04,658
of a ore-senile dimming of the senses...

426
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:07,657
of an intoxicating
kaleidoscope of desires...

427
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:13,291
Unlike the family man Cusimano,
But...

428
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,498
Cadei is...

429
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:19,752
and was...

430
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,174
a bachelor... a bachelor!

431
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,380
Clever, that lawyer.

432
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:25,428
He's a bachelor himself.

433
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:30,771
Careful investigation
of the facts tell us, therefore...

434
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:34,183
that the Scordia woman
committed no other crime...

435
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,936
than that of being ill-fated,

436
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:40,815
alone and beautiful.

437
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,066
Here is her crimel her beauty!

438
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,784
And from here, the envy,

439
00:56:44,785 --> 00:56:47,325
the lies, the disgrace,

440
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:50,908
that have deprived her
even of a father's trust!

441
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:55,539
And yet, she herself
is still in silent agony...

442
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,417
mourning over
that unmarked war grave...

443
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:05,716
in faraway East Africa.

444
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,177
In the beating heart of our argument...

445
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:14,933
is an audacipus, _
but nonetheless vahd, thesis...

446
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,100
which asks just one question?

447
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:19,319
Can a young woman...

448
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:24,315
after the odyssey of a widowhood
endured for the love of country...

449
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:29,493
hope for protection
in the shelter of a new life?

450
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:32,992
Does she have the right
to yearn for, and to write...

451
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,249
a new ending to her own love story?

452
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,081
Your Honor,

453
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:41,466
the citizens
of Castelcuto replyi "Yes!"

454
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,139
Will Cusimano
leave me alone now?

455
00:57:55,347 --> 00:58:00,103
Of course. He's been put
into a psychiatric clinic.

456
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:03,272
He wants to volunteer
for the Forces in East Africa.

457
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:08,243
He doesn't realize
we lost Africa ages ago!

458
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:12,285
But let's forget Cusimano
and the fickle Lt. Cadei.

459
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:14,659
Let's get to us!

460
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:20,756
I know it's not much.

461
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:24,502
But it's all I have.
They've cut my pension.

462
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,920
Don't you understand?

463
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:29,678
That's peanuts!

464
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,551
My fee is much more than that.

465
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:36,559
You'll never have enough money!

466
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,684
But how will I ever repay you?

467
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:42,687
It's very easy, my sweet.

468
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:47,070
What are you saying?
- Be with me, my love!

469
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,026
I'm in love with you!

470
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,416
A woman shouldn't be alone
during these hard times.

471
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,794
I am a wealthy man.
You won't find better.

472
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,976
I'll take care of your father.
You'll never have to worry again.

473
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:33,488
I forgive her. She did it
to pay her lawyer's fees

474
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,117
only once and never again.

475
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,491
But you didn't keep our agreement.

476
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,210
Now we're even.

477
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:55,095
Signora Malena,
a more capable person than me...

478
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:59,008
wrote that the only truelove
is unrequited love.

479
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,884
Now I understand why.

480
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:04,142
It's been so long since you
last came out of your house.

481
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:07,766
But the longer we are apart,
the stronger my love becomes.

482
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:12,526
They say you're about to marry
Centorbi, the lawyer.

483
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:14,648
I know how badly
they treat you here,

484
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:18,243
how the women in the market
won't sell you any good food...

485
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,779
and no man would hire you
for fear of his wife.

486
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:25,159
But how will you manage to live
with a fat, old man...

487
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:28,496
so ugly that no girl
ever wanted him?

488
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:33,501
They say he never washes
and stinks like a goat.

489
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:36,762
How will your smooth, white skin...
bear rubbing against

490
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,926
the sweat of an old man...

491
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:42,927
who never does anything
without his mother's consent?

492
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:11,046
Is it true you're getting married?

493
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:14,456
What are you writing?

494
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:17,552
Give me that!
Let me see!

495
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:19,679
Get out!

496
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,612
Stand up straight.

497
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:46,744
A little longer, Don Placido.

498
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:50,870
More room in the waist,
for when he gets bigger.

499
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,124
Will they be ready tomorrow?

500
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:56,003
The war has ruined
my business, but it still takes time.

501
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:58,377
As Allied bombings continue.

502
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,384
Wait for me.

503
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:12,641
Lord, help me with my mother,
I beg you.

504
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,028
Moron! Idiot!

505
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:22,358
Idiot!

506
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,527
You can't treat me like a child.
I'm a grown man!

507
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:26,405
Get this straight.
Your father's good name...

508
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:30,908
will never belong
to that disgusting whore!

509
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:33,285
Never! Never!

510
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:33,786
Never!

511
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:03,783
The lawyer was left
high and dry!

512
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,325
His mother still bathes him
every Saturday!

513
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,828
Malena always ha_s someone
throwmg a wrench In the works!

514
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:14,582
It won't be hard finding someone
to replace the lawyer!

515
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:20,332
- Come on, sit down.
- The next in line already has a plan.

516
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,836
Yeah, his plan is in his pants.

517
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,923
- A cut and shave.
- Right away, sir.

518
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:52,391
Good morning, Antonio.

519
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,307
I brought some sugar and flour.

520
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,685
- What about the bread?
- The best.

521
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,689
- I can't pay right now.
- That's no problem.

522
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:08,908
I'm sure we can find a way
to make you some money.

523
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:18,266
Hurry, there's someone else over here!

524
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:41,994
It's Professor Bonsignore.

525
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,250
Malena's father.

526
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:52,780
I'm here for you.

527
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,448
Condolences, Signora Scordia.

528
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:01,698
Condolences.

529
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:08,328
Step aside, kid.

530
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:11,080
Signora, what can we do?
We're in the Lord's hands.

531
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:12,083
Don't forget my offer.

532
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:01,131
Who is it?
- It's me.

533
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,897
- Me who?
- Salvatore. Antonio sent me.

534
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:05,715
I brought you some more food.

535
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:08,138
Come in.

536
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:25,117
- Your hair looks terrific.
- Do you like it?

537
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:29,122
- Yes, it makes you look younger.
- Thank you.

538
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:45,671
I can come every Thursday!

539
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:47,515
As long as you bring the food.

540
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:25,212
Never before in our history have
we been called upon to band together.

541
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:28,218
Just a few years ago,
ll Duce promised

542
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:31,925
that the Nazis would
never occupy Sicily.

543
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:33,803
Look! The Germans are everywhere!

544
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:36,973
Look who's here.

545
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,122
She's a redhead now.

546
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:04,000
Look how she's put together.

547
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:06,469
I'd like to cut off that hair.

548
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,769
How disgusting!

549
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:14,346
Now she's even screwing the Germans.

550
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:18,383
- Who's that?
- Malena Scordia, the slut.

551
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:21,638
She's teamed up
with that other whore, Gina.

552
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:24,515
But with the Germans?

553
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:28,144
Seems there are gymnastics
at the Moderno Hotel.

554
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:31,397
The two whores run
from room to room...

555
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:35,360
servicing a dozen officers at a time.

556
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:37,282
Holy Shit!

557
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:11,938
My good woman, this child
is possessed by the devil!

558
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:14,315
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

559
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:24,283
Rosa!

560
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,205
Come here!

561
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:32,424
That's enough!

562
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,712
It looks like you're posing
for Michelangelo's Pieta of the poor!

563
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:37,054
No.

564
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:40,967
Evil eye on blood is fed.
Hold on fast till death is past.

565
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:44,345
Exorcise the devil
from this child.

566
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,305
Goat red, on wood fed,
hold on fast.

567
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,979
Head and tail,
evil eye release this child.

568
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:51,478
Cast the devil into the wild.

569
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,230
Shameful!

570
01:18:54,355 --> 01:18:57,859
Disgraceful!

571
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:02,989
They cured my uncle this way...
and he had cholera!

572
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:05,866
Your son's_not sick!
He's becoming a man!

573
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:09,124
With a dick this big,
he needs to fuck!

574
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:19,634
Renato!

575
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:28,013
Renato, wait here for me.

576
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:38,365
Come here. Come on.
Close the door.

577
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:40,902
- My father?
- He's coming.

578
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:43,778
Ladies!

579
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,656
Choose the one you like.

580
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:48,788
Ladies!

581
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:50,744
What do we have here?

582
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:52,788
Fresh young meat.

583
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:01,486
Lupetta, up to the room.

584
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,237
Treat him right.

585
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:16,876
- What's your name?
- Amoroso Renato.

586
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:18,878
Amoroso. What a romantic name!

587
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:23,630
Tonight we either die in a bombing
or end up in jail.

588
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:29,475
Go ahead.

589
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:16,826
- Is it your first time?
- No.

590
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:20,500
I've imagined it many times.

591
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:45,672
Let's go give that shameless whore
what she deserves.

592
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,718
Stay back.
This is between the women.

593
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:25,765
Now you'll see what happens
when you steal our men...

594
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:38,319
and sleep with the filthy Germans.

595
01:26:41,071 --> 01:26:43,039
It's the end of spreading
your legs, whore!

596
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,092
Now let's see
what men make of you!

597
01:27:08,348 --> 01:27:10,726
The madame is served.

598
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:21,425
Get lost!

599
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,391
Disappear!

600
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:21,537
- I know that face.
Who is it?

601
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:26,667
Nino Scordia, Malena's husband.

602
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:30,049
Malena, the one who did it
with the Germans.

603
01:32:36,301 --> 01:32:40,272
Poor guy.
He was better off dead.

604
01:32:46,686 --> 01:32:48,313
Isn't that Malena's husband?

605
01:33:15,465 --> 01:33:18,810
Hey, Giovanni,
there's a strange guy.

606
01:33:28,103 --> 01:33:29,730
Do you know Malena Scordia?

607
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:31,697
Who's she?

608
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:34,325
Who are you?
This is my family's house!

609
01:33:34,326 --> 01:33:36,240
We don't know anything.

610
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:39,080
When we_c_ame,
no one was living here.

611
01:33:39,197 --> 01:33:40,699
No one?

612
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:58,884
Poor guy. No one
will tell him the truth.

613
01:33:58,885 --> 01:34:02,886
What would you say,
"I hear your wife is a prostitute"?

614
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:06,608
I hear she's still
a great piece of ass.

615
01:34:06,766 --> 01:34:10,145
I lost an arm.
I wasn't dead!

616
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:14,650
Then I was taken prisoner in India
and I contracted malaria. Tell him.

617
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:17,361
Sir, he lost his arm...

618
01:34:17,527 --> 01:34:19,780
Hey, kid, what are
you doing here? Go away.

619
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:21,657
Me "boy-bar." Coffee.

620
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:25,742
I have to get the coffee cups.
Understand?

621
01:34:25,743 --> 01:34:26,915
Okay, okay.

622
01:34:27,912 --> 01:34:30,916
My family has lived in this town
for generations.

623
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,292
Now no one will talk to me.

624
01:34:33,293 --> 01:34:34,795
My house is a refugee camp,
and my wife has disappeared.

625
01:34:34,878 --> 01:34:37,927
No one in town_knows
where she IS.

626
01:34:39,299 --> 01:34:41,925
His wife was the woman

627
01:34:41,926 --> 01:34:44,645
we saw beaten up
on the day we arrived here.

628
01:34:44,804 --> 01:34:47,557
Everybody says she's
a prostitute in a whorehouse.

629
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:49,938
Help me find her.
I want to bring her home.

630
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:17,838
Excuse rne. Do[1't you remember me?
I'm Nlno Scordla.

631
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:21,801
- You mistake me for someone else.
- Could I have a light?

632
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:26,221
You were the Fascist secretary,
and you were his deputy.

633
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:28,189
You can help me. Do you know
what happened to my wife?

634
01:35:28,306 --> 01:35:30,604
Didn't she join the Communist Party?

635
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:36,357
She was photographed
with her arms around the Commie leader.

636
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:41,616
You're a family of heroes!

637
01:35:43,696 --> 01:35:45,323
You're right.

638
01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:49,961
Those who fought the war
for you bastards aren't heroes.

639
01:35:51,371 --> 01:35:54,466
Go take a walk through
the brothels of Sicily.

640
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:58,132
You may find your wife there!

641
01:36:58,688 --> 01:37:02,659
Wait a minute. Come back!

642
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:10,450
Dear Signor Scordia,

643
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:14,458
forgive me if I don't have
the courage to speak man to man.

644
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:19,839
These last months have taught me much about
courage, even if I have found little myself.

645
01:37:20,209 --> 01:37:22,962
I'm the only one who knows
the truth about your wife.

646
01:37:23,087 --> 01:37:27,342
Around here, they only say
bad things about her.

647
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:31,597
But believe me, your wife
Malena was faithful to you.

648
01:37:31,721 --> 01:37:35,567
You are the only man she loved.
This is the honest truth.

649
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:38,560
It is true,
a lot of things happened,

650
01:37:38,561 --> 01:37:41,940
but back then,
you had been dead along time.

651
01:37:42,231 --> 01:37:46,987
The last time_ I saw her, _she was
on a tram for Messma.

652
01:37:47,236 --> 01:37:51,457
I should sign "a friend,"
like all anonymous letters,

653
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:53,493
but my name is Renato.

654
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:28,745
A year later

655
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,660
Good morning, Judge.

656
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:39,164
All is well, thank God.

657
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:42,758
Eat up, my sweet pea.

658
01:38:55,555 --> 01:38:59,182
- Sons of bitches!
- Look who's here!

659
01:38:59,183 --> 01:39:01,151
Giorgio, look who's here!

660
01:40:02,872 --> 01:40:05,625
Why are you all
looking at that woman?

661
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:07,252
It's nothing.

662
01:40:35,404 --> 01:40:38,283
I saw them in the square.
They were walking arm in arm.

663
01:40:38,366 --> 01:40:40,414
Quiet. She's here!

664
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:44,918
It took a lot of courage to come back.

665
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:47,417
Look who's here.

666
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:51,546
I heard it,
but I didn't believe it.

667
01:40:51,671 --> 01:40:54,550
- What have they got to look at?
- They should leave her in peace.

668
01:40:57,552 --> 01:41:00,055
She's got some wrinkles
around her eyes.

669
01:41:00,179 --> 01:41:01,806
She's put on weight, too.

670
01:41:04,392 --> 01:41:06,315
But she's still beautiful.

671
01:41:06,644 --> 01:41:08,817
Good morning, Mrs. Scordia.

672
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:26,164
Good morning.

673
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:31,586
Want some nice tomatoes?
They cost less over there.

674
01:41:31,587 --> 01:41:33,964
- Good morning.
- Thank you.

675
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:39,093
Nice things here!

676
01:41:39,927 --> 01:41:42,851
- Like it, Signora Malena?
- Yes.

677
01:41:42,972 --> 01:41:45,350
- Try it on.
- No, that's okay.

678
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:47,476
- It's no problem.
- Another time.

679
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:51,860
Give me your bag.
We'll discuss it later.

680
01:41:51,981 --> 01:41:54,825
- Thank you.
- Good day.

681
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:56,387
It's okay. I'll get it.

682
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:02,427
Thank you.

683
01:43:05,554 --> 01:43:06,806
Thank you for your help.

684
01:43:13,145 --> 01:43:15,193
Good luck, Signora Malena.

685
01:43:45,344 --> 01:43:48,848
I pedaled as fast as I could

686
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:51,104
as if I were escaping...

687
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:54,229
_from longing,
from innocence, from her.

688
01:43:54,437 --> 01:43:56,860
Time has passed,
and I have loved many women.

689
01:43:57,231 --> 01:44:00,110
And as they've held me close...

690
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:04,738
and asked if I will
remember them,

691
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:09,996
,I've said,
"Yes, I wlll remember you."

692
01:44:10,202 --> 01:44:14,082
But the only one I've never forgotten
is the one who never asked...

693
01:44:14,206 --> 01:44:15,378
Malena.

694
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:06,481
