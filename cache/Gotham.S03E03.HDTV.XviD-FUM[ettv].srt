1
00:00:01,214 --> 00:00:04,505
- Previously on Gotham...
- Who are you?

2
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:07,438
- Oh, my word.
- Please don't hurt me.

3
00:00:07,473 --> 00:00:09,173
- We caught a spy.
- Ivy?

4
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:09,974
No!

5
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:11,642
Watch out!

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,297
Ivy?

7
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:17,999
Gotham listens to me.

8
00:00:18,034 --> 00:00:20,501
It's time to round up our friends.

9
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:24,038
Former war hero.

10
00:00:24,073 --> 00:00:26,340
Former white knight
cop. Now bounty hunter.

11
00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:28,576
Saving Gotham's not my job anymore.

12
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,812
You are a cop in everything but name.

13
00:00:30,847 --> 00:00:33,815
Who the hell are you, Jim Gordon?

14
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,750
- Wait...
- Shut up for once.

15
00:00:54,404 --> 00:00:56,003
When I count to three,

16
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,506
you will all awake and have no memory

17
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,903
of your animal identity.

18
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:03,811
One, two,

19
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:04,846
three.

20
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:10,518
Thank you. Thank you.

21
00:01:10,553 --> 00:01:12,854
A magician? Really?

22
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:15,256
Hypnotist. I like him.

23
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,924
Plus, the place is packed. Be happy.

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,285
Just a taste,

25
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,594
ladies and gentlemen.

26
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:24,131
But now let us venture
into something more...

27
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,566
arcane.

28
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:28,035
I'll need a single volunteer.

29
00:01:31,274 --> 00:01:33,307
Hmm.

30
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:38,480
You, sir.

31
00:01:39,694 --> 00:01:41,761
Beautiful suit.

32
00:01:41,796 --> 00:01:43,429
- Thank you.
- Lawyer?

33
00:01:43,464 --> 00:01:45,264
- Uh, doctor.
- Oh.

34
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,399
Your mistress?

35
00:01:46,434 --> 00:01:48,367
- My-my wife.
- Oh, delightful.

36
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,540
Listen to the watch.

37
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:56,142
The way it's ticking

38
00:01:56,822 --> 00:01:58,911
synchronizes with your heartbeat.

39
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:05,051
Look into my eyes.

40
00:02:05,086 --> 00:02:07,253
Not above them, not around them,

41
00:02:07,288 --> 00:02:10,222
but deep into their center.

42
00:02:12,093 --> 00:02:15,806
You are completely relaxed
and are becoming weightless.

43
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,299
Are you ready to do
something impossible?

44
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:21,634
Yes.

45
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:29,341
Stand upon the chair.

46
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,480
No.

47
00:02:34,515 --> 00:02:35,548
The back of it.

48
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,651
Remember, you weigh nothing at all.

49
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:43,122
- He'll fall.
- Not at all, my dear.

50
00:02:48,362 --> 00:02:52,331
In a hypnotic state,
unburdened by doubt and fear,

51
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:54,667
we can accomplish the impossible.

52
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:57,002
Now...

53
00:02:57,038 --> 00:02:58,716
one foot.

54
00:03:03,144 --> 00:03:05,778
So you could get him to
do anything you wanted?

55
00:03:05,813 --> 00:03:08,074
Did you have something
in mind, Miss Kean?

56
00:03:10,351 --> 00:03:11,989
Jump down, sir.

57
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:18,023
Lock sense away.

58
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:19,692
Awaken the rascal.

59
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:22,967
When I say it is so,
your home is my castle.

60
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:24,563
Now, I'm going to count down

61
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,198
and clap my hands and you will awake.

62
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:28,134
Three, two, one.

63
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:31,704
How do you feel, sir?

64
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,139
I feel great.

65
00:03:34,308 --> 00:03:35,741
Thank you!

66
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:38,377
Thank you.

67
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:43,515
Very impressive, Mr. Tetch.

68
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,284
You have quite the gift.

69
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,022
But you didn't answer my question.

70
00:03:47,035 --> 00:03:50,589
Can you make people do
anything you tell them to do?

71
00:03:51,826 --> 00:03:54,260
Only things they secretly wish to do.

72
00:03:54,295 --> 00:03:57,196
It's surprising what people wish for,

73
00:03:57,231 --> 00:03:59,565
secretly, deep down.

74
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,033
- Mm.
- True.

75
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:03,169
You must be a very popular man.

76
00:04:03,204 --> 00:04:04,737
Oh, I wish.

77
00:04:04,772 --> 00:04:07,573
Parties like this help
pay my way, so thank you.

78
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:09,241
And you're new to Gotham?

79
00:04:09,277 --> 00:04:11,110
Yes. Just arrived from up north.

80
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:12,411
You have a place to stay?

81
00:04:12,446 --> 00:04:13,767
Not yet.

82
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,507
But something always seems to turn up.

83
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:23,486
- sync and corrections by madhatters -
- www.addic7ed.com -

84
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,600
This is weird for me, too.

85
00:04:34,635 --> 00:04:36,468
What's-what's your name?

86
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:37,703
Five.

87
00:04:37,738 --> 00:04:41,140
Well, 514A, but they call me Five.

88
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:43,409
- At Indian Hill?
- Yes.

89
00:04:43,444 --> 00:04:45,044
And how 'bout before that?

90
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,780
I-I don't remember... I don't
remember anything before that.

91
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:49,081
That's convenient, isn't it?

92
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:50,149
I mean, nothing?

93
00:04:50,184 --> 00:04:51,917
I mean, you must have had a home,

94
00:04:51,953 --> 00:04:53,552
family, friends,

95
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:55,154
parents.

96
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:56,455
If I did, I can't remember.

97
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,891
I woke up in that lab over a year ago.

98
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:01,393
I was locked up the
whole time I was there.

99
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:05,731
They gave me books, did tests on me.

100
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:07,132
Many tests.

101
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:09,301
I heard the other inmates in the halls,

102
00:05:09,337 --> 00:05:11,503
but I never saw them.

103
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:13,606
Not until Ms. Mooney broke us out.

104
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:16,275
I'm sorry I surprised
you by coming here.

105
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,117
When-when I saw you...

106
00:05:19,013 --> 00:05:20,312
I had to meet you.

107
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,916
You saw me?

108
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:27,486
On the rooftop.

109
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:28,921
With that girl.

110
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:30,990
Selina. She gave me money.

111
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:32,591
I followed her.

112
00:05:32,627 --> 00:05:35,427
You're welcome to stay
here as long as you need.

113
00:05:35,463 --> 00:05:37,763
Perhaps we should contact
someone with more expertise

114
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:39,765
in these matters, Master Bruce.

115
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,934
It's late. That can wait until tomorrow.

116
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:43,402
I'll make up one of the guest rooms.

117
00:05:48,476 --> 00:05:49,808
Master Bruce,

118
00:05:49,844 --> 00:05:51,977
we have to get rid of that
thing as quick as possible.

119
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:53,979
He's a human being, Alfred.
He's in need of help.

120
00:05:54,015 --> 00:05:55,814
Look, I-I understand

121
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,550
you feel sorry for the boy, but have
a butcher's at him, will you, huh?

122
00:05:58,586 --> 00:06:00,686
I mean, he's you. Hugo
Strange made another you.

123
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:01,921
I reckon it's got something to do

124
00:06:01,956 --> 00:06:03,155
with that secret society or something.

125
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,990
So what do we do?

126
00:06:05,026 --> 00:06:07,126
Throw him back on the
street? I-I want to know

127
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:09,228
who and what and why as
much as you do, Alfred.

128
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:11,196
Better he stays here until we find out.

129
00:06:11,232 --> 00:06:12,431
Fine, but tomorrow we call Lucius Fox.

130
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:14,646
Maybe he'll know what to
do with it. I mean, him.

131
00:06:36,742 --> 00:06:38,991
- Valerie.
- James.

132
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:40,592
You want some breakfast?

133
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:42,594
There's a place around the corner.

134
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,096
Pass.

135
00:06:44,131 --> 00:06:45,898
I have to be at City Hall in an hour.

136
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:46,932
I have to go home and shower.

137
00:06:46,968 --> 00:06:48,367
I have a shower.

138
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:50,369
No, you have a dark hole in the wall

139
00:06:50,438 --> 00:06:52,538
with no water pressure
and one damp towel.

140
00:06:52,573 --> 00:06:54,373
Right.

141
00:06:56,727 --> 00:07:00,179
Well, I'm collecting my bounty
from the GCPD today, so, uh,

142
00:07:00,214 --> 00:07:02,681
I can stop on my way home, make things

143
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:05,384
a little... nicer.

144
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:07,753
Yeah, good luck with that.

145
00:07:16,497 --> 00:07:18,197
That was fun.

146
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:20,432
See you around.

147
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,902
Okay. See ya.

148
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:26,638
I'm not gonna get all misty-eyed,

149
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:30,809
but the simple truth is this
department has missed you.

150
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:34,279
God-given talent like
yours is hard to find.

151
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:37,282
Your expertise and your
professionalism is exemplary.

152
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:40,319
I'm very pleased that you're
returning to the GCPD.

153
00:07:40,354 --> 00:07:42,988
Where else can you make a
difference like this? Nowhere.

154
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:45,924
- I know. It's not that...
- Look...

155
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,760
now,

156
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:49,895
forgive me if I'm, uh,

157
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,698
stepping into a delicate minefield,

158
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:54,867
but if what you're worried
about is Jim Gordon,

159
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:57,102
he no longer works here.

160
00:07:57,138 --> 00:08:00,239
No GCPD affiliation whatsoever.

161
00:08:04,211 --> 00:08:05,544
Hey, Harvey.

162
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:07,980
Jim!

163
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:10,249
Buddy. Pal. Ha-ha.

164
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:11,583
Let's get a cup of coffee.

165
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:13,185
I just came by for my check.

166
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,722
City still owes me for bringing
in the last of Strange's creeps.

167
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:18,624
- Yeah, you been hustlin'...
- Jim?

168
00:08:29,837 --> 00:08:33,205
Hello, Jim. What-what are you...

169
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:36,508
Hey. You look well.

170
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:37,799
Thanks.

171
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,979
You visiting?

172
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:43,749
No, we're... um, I'm-I'm moving here.

173
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:46,351
Permanently.

174
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:49,154
With my fiancé.

175
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:57,262
He's been offered head trauma
position at Gotham General.

176
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:59,264
A doctor. Good call.

177
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:04,002
Captain Barnes has been
nice enough to offer me

178
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:06,004
my old job back. Here. Um...

179
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,573
I haven't decided yet.

180
00:09:07,641 --> 00:09:10,375
Well, if you did, you'd see me.

181
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:12,911
I'm here now and again getting paid.

182
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:16,844
It's good to see you, Lee.

183
00:09:20,688 --> 00:09:23,659
I guess I better get going.
The movers are due any minute.

184
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:26,892
Be well, Jim.

185
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,832
Jim.

186
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:38,137
Where's my money, Harvey?

187
00:09:52,653 --> 00:09:54,853
Hello?

188
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:56,922
Lock sense away.

189
00:09:56,957 --> 00:09:58,924
Awaken the rascal.

190
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,459
When I say it is so,

191
00:10:00,494 --> 00:10:03,395
your home is my castle.

192
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:07,032
Go to the door.

193
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,917
Honey?

194
00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:07,563
Wh-Who are you?

195
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:10,138
Who am I?

196
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:16,119
I haunt your dreams like a ghost,

197
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:18,021
for I know what scares you most.

198
00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:21,758
So you run, run!

199
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:23,026
As fast as you can!

200
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:26,430
There's no escape from the magic man.

201
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:33,704
Jolly good.

202
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:36,039
Now, get some plastic,

203
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:38,041
wrap her up and bury her in the garden.

204
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:40,978
Oh, and I'm gonna need
you to kill yourself, too.

205
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:42,479
Chop-chop.

206
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:00,063
My sweet sister.

207
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:02,132
Alice.

208
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:04,534
I've traveled so far.

209
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,537
So come out, come out,

210
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:09,539
wherever you are.

211
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,079
Alice!

212
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:18,682
Hey! Alice!

213
00:12:25,424 --> 00:12:29,226
This time, no excuses.
My money... where is it?

214
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:31,361
I'll get it for you.

215
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:32,663
You said that last week,

216
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:34,464
the week before that.

217
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,467
I should have known you're a liar.

218
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,102
- A cheat!
- I lost my job.

219
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:42,739
Then get another! Don't cheat me!

220
00:12:46,178 --> 00:12:49,279
But, uh, perhaps...

221
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:51,915
we work something out, eh?

222
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,283
If you're a nice girl?

223
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:55,719
Are you a nice girl?

224
00:12:55,754 --> 00:12:57,120
Stay away from me.

225
00:12:57,156 --> 00:12:59,723
- Oh, be nice to me.
- Stop, you don't understand.

226
00:12:59,758 --> 00:13:00,791
Be nice...

227
00:13:00,826 --> 00:13:02,659
Oh!

228
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:15,605
I'm so sorry.

229
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:16,973
You shouldn't have done that.

230
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:18,975
You brought this on yourself.

231
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,346
Since the death

232
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:24,348
of Galavan, the office of mayor

233
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:26,316
has been governed by
the elected officials

234
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:28,151
you see behind me.

235
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:31,355
This city desperately needs experienced,

236
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,656
seasoned leadership.

237
00:13:32,691 --> 00:13:34,157
And so, in their wisdom,

238
00:13:34,193 --> 00:13:35,692
they have persuaded me...

239
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:37,394
Much against my will...

240
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:39,463
To resume the office of mayor

241
00:13:39,498 --> 00:13:41,031
until elections can be organized

242
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:42,866
in the new year.

243
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:44,534
Stop!

244
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:51,074
This proceeding is a sham.

245
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,143
- Security, remove this criminal!
- Criminal?

246
00:13:53,178 --> 00:13:56,680
I was jailed illegally
by a corrupt system.

247
00:13:56,715 --> 00:14:00,617
A corrupt system that was
put into place by this man,

248
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:02,986
who has the audacity

249
00:14:03,021 --> 00:14:05,922
to put himself back into
the position that he brought

250
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,724
so much shame and dishonor to.

251
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,192
How dare you?

252
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:10,927
No, how dare you

253
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:13,864
waltz up there and
announce yourself mayor?

254
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:18,402
The people demand to have a say
into who will represent them,

255
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:20,737
- who will protect them.
- Yeah! Yeah!

256
00:14:20,773 --> 00:14:23,673
- Yeah!
- It was I...

257
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:27,411
I alone... who drove out the
monsters that plagued our city.

258
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:30,247
Oh, please. Where were you then,

259
00:14:30,282 --> 00:14:33,784
while I faced peril at the
hands of those abominations?

260
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:37,254
Sir, are you challenging
James's appointment to office?

261
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:39,189
I most certainly am.

262
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,293
You better get a close-up.

263
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:50,033
To govern this city, one
should be legally elected,

264
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:52,469
which is why I, Oswald Cobblepot,

265
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:55,472
announce my candidacy
for the office of mayor.

266
00:14:55,507 --> 00:14:56,807
And I demand,

267
00:14:56,842 --> 00:14:58,542
and the people demand,

268
00:14:58,577 --> 00:15:02,746
that an emergency election
be held forthwith!

269
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:09,653
Cobblepot! Cobblepot! Cobblepot!

270
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,340
Good, good, good.

271
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,509
One more time, one more time.

272
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,544
And again.

273
00:15:24,646 --> 00:15:25,645
Good boy.

274
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:28,416
One more time.

275
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:29,592
Good morning.

276
00:15:29,643 --> 00:15:31,484
Did you sleep well?

277
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,485
Yes.

278
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,689
Would you like to try?

279
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:38,224
Uh, I don't think

280
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:39,859
that's a particularly good
idea, do you Master Bruce?

281
00:15:39,894 --> 00:15:42,061
Come now, Alfred, I think a
little exercise before breakfast

282
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:43,229
might be just what he needs.

283
00:15:43,264 --> 00:15:45,164
Fine.

284
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,367
I'll go easy on you. Pop these on.

285
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:49,502
Right hand in. And the other one.

286
00:15:49,537 --> 00:15:51,671
Like that. All right, step up.

287
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:53,473
Now, just remember...

288
00:15:53,508 --> 00:15:56,576
Let's see what you got,
no, keep your gloves up.

289
00:15:56,611 --> 00:15:58,878
Protect the chin at
all times, all right?

290
00:15:58,913 --> 00:16:01,547
Ready? Here we go. Bosh.

291
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,516
Ready?

292
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:04,751
Come on.

293
00:16:06,588 --> 00:16:07,854
- Sorry. Sorry...
- No,

294
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:09,555
ab-absolutely fine.

295
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:11,791
Let's see if we can do that again.

296
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:12,792
Here I come.

297
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:18,407
Bloody hell.

298
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:21,401
Who taught you how to do that then?

299
00:16:21,436 --> 00:16:22,984
No one.

300
00:16:22,996 --> 00:16:25,667
If they did, I... I don't remember.

301
00:16:27,425 --> 00:16:30,576
Right, well, let's see
what you got, sunshine.

302
00:16:30,612 --> 00:16:32,311
Here we go again. Here we go.

303
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:36,582
Oh.

304
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:39,485
Oh, dear. I'm frightfully sorry.

305
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:41,254
What for?

306
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:43,322
- Your nose.
- Didn't you feel it?

307
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,793
No.

308
00:16:46,828 --> 00:16:48,230
Should I?

309
00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:51,597
Right, well, I think that's, uh...

310
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:54,667
quite enough for today,
don't you, Master Bruce?

311
00:16:54,702 --> 00:16:55,935
Here you are.

312
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,470
Press that hard against your nose.

313
00:16:57,505 --> 00:17:00,339
All right? Here you go.

314
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,823
Stem the flow.

315
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:03,558
Good lad.

316
00:17:08,531 --> 00:17:10,998
Well, that's a very nasty scar.

317
00:17:12,024 --> 00:17:14,199
Where'd you get that?
Or can't you remember?

318
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:19,574
What did they do to you in there?

319
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,918
Good day, Mr. Gordon.

320
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:32,269
Tea?

321
00:17:32,322 --> 00:17:33,287
How'd you find me?

322
00:17:33,323 --> 00:17:34,856
Oh, you're famous, sir.

323
00:17:34,891 --> 00:17:36,791
Your name's in the papers.

324
00:17:36,826 --> 00:17:38,659
The fearless bounty hunter.

325
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:46,634
I want you to find my sister.

326
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,270
We're very close.

327
00:17:49,305 --> 00:17:52,573
We lost our parents at an early age.

328
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:54,775
I became her guardian.

329
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:56,711
But her condition proved

330
00:17:56,746 --> 00:17:58,228
too much for me. I sought help.

331
00:17:58,267 --> 00:17:59,881
The worst kind.

332
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,250
The fiend, Professor Strange.

333
00:18:02,285 --> 00:18:04,218
Her condition?

334
00:18:04,254 --> 00:18:06,487
Some poison in her blood.

335
00:18:06,522 --> 00:18:09,457
Very rare. Unique, in fact.

336
00:18:09,492 --> 00:18:10,825
He took her in.

337
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,127
Said she needed constant supervision.

338
00:18:13,162 --> 00:18:15,062
He wouldn't let me see her.

339
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:16,564
You go to the police?

340
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,499
Useless.

341
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:20,891
This is Gotham after all.

342
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:24,105
The years passed and I lost hope.

343
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,007
But then I heard about the breakout.

344
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:28,175
I assumed she escaped with others.

345
00:18:28,211 --> 00:18:29,310
But now she is out there.

346
00:18:29,345 --> 00:18:30,378
Alone.

347
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:31,412
Afraid.

348
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:34,989
Indian Hill escapees get
five grand from the GCPD.

349
00:18:35,027 --> 00:18:36,497
You able to top that?

350
00:18:38,021 --> 00:18:39,253
I'll double it.

351
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,429
I'll see what I can do.

352
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,256
Thank you very much.

353
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,390
Leave your number.

354
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,213
You've seen so much pain and tragedy,

355
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:07,848
Mr. Gordon.

356
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:09,917
I hope it hasn't left you too alone.

357
00:19:13,156 --> 00:19:14,722
I'm not being negative.

358
00:19:14,757 --> 00:19:17,425
I'm just saying, it's a big step.

359
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,628
Holy crap.

360
00:19:20,663 --> 00:19:21,629
Headquarters, let me
just say one thing first.

361
00:19:21,664 --> 00:19:24,632
Gotham is rife with crime, Butch.

362
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,500
Who better than a
criminal to clean it up?

363
00:19:26,536 --> 00:19:28,169
Okay. Look,

364
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:30,404
you know I've faced the
worst Gotham has to offer,

365
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,807
but politicians, they scare me.

366
00:19:32,842 --> 00:19:34,342
The people of Gotham are with me.

367
00:19:34,377 --> 00:19:36,177
They are scared, which means angry.

368
00:19:36,212 --> 00:19:38,212
And who have they got to turn to?

369
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:40,047
Aubrey James?

370
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,048
Please.

371
00:19:41,084 --> 00:19:43,384
That man is a hack.

372
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:47,688
This is my opportunity
to create a legacy.

373
00:19:47,724 --> 00:19:50,424
One that my father would be proud of.

374
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,426
- Mr. Cobblepot?
- Oh.

375
00:19:52,462 --> 00:19:54,261
What do you think?

376
00:19:58,735 --> 00:19:59,967
You got my vote.

377
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:03,871
Mr. Cobblepot, I have Aubrey James.

378
00:20:03,906 --> 00:20:05,773
He'd like to meet you, alone.

379
00:20:06,943 --> 00:20:08,709
Hmm.

380
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:30,464
What are you looking for?

381
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,034
The scars on your back are distinctive.

382
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:34,468
I was hoping to find a reference,

383
00:20:34,504 --> 00:20:36,604
a clue as to why they were made.

384
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:38,439
You need to hide.

385
00:20:38,474 --> 00:20:40,141
What?

386
00:20:42,678 --> 00:20:44,478
She won't understand.

387
00:20:45,915 --> 00:20:47,915
What are you doing?

388
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,116
Homework.

389
00:20:52,688 --> 00:20:53,829
Is something wrong?

390
00:20:57,794 --> 00:20:59,660
Ivy's missing.

391
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:03,786
She'll turn up somewhere.

392
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,133
Doesn't she always?

393
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,470
This time, she fell.

394
00:21:09,505 --> 00:21:13,240
And it was a long way down into water.

395
00:21:13,276 --> 00:21:14,675
And maybe she survived.

396
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,946
I got a bad feeling.

397
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,247
No offense, but...

398
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:24,952
it's not like you to care.

399
00:21:24,987 --> 00:21:27,955
She had nothing, that kid.

400
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,957
I was it.

401
00:21:29,992 --> 00:21:32,827
No one else would even talk to her.

402
00:21:47,977 --> 00:21:49,477
I shouldn't give up, right?

403
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:52,746
Maybe take one more
look at the shelters,

404
00:21:52,782 --> 00:21:54,381
our favorite hiding spots?

405
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:56,383
Sure.

406
00:21:56,419 --> 00:21:57,985
Good idea.

407
00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:01,856
Will you come with me?

408
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:07,128
If I had a car, I could
get around much quicker.

409
00:22:09,365 --> 00:22:12,032
Uh, yeah, I mean... no.

410
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:14,835
- No. Not-not right now. I just...
- What?

411
00:22:14,871 --> 00:22:15,903
That's too much to ask?

412
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:17,638
After everything I've done for you?

413
00:22:17,673 --> 00:22:20,040
- Selina, it's not like that. I...
- Forget it.

414
00:22:20,076 --> 00:22:22,710
It was stupid of me to even come here.

415
00:22:22,745 --> 00:22:25,080
Sel... I just... It's-it's
just not a good time.

416
00:22:27,683 --> 00:22:30,319
You're a selfish son of a
bitch. You know that, right?

417
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,458
I'm sorry.

418
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:40,895
I'm sorry.

419
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:46,267
I'm sorry.

420
00:22:49,872 --> 00:22:51,839
I'm sorry.

421
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:06,875
Selina?

422
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:09,406
What do you want? I'm looking for
someone. I think you may have seen her.

423
00:23:09,441 --> 00:23:11,408
And if I have, why would I tell you?

424
00:23:11,443 --> 00:23:14,945
She's in trouble, and I can pay you.

425
00:23:20,152 --> 00:23:21,718
I don't need your money.

426
00:23:21,753 --> 00:23:24,754
- So what do you need?
- Ivy.

427
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,289
She's missing.

428
00:23:26,325 --> 00:23:27,824
- For how long?
- Too long.

429
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:31,595
Just... keep an eye
open for her, would you?

430
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,997
Will do.

431
00:23:34,032 --> 00:23:36,132
She's from Indian Hill.

432
00:23:36,168 --> 00:23:37,549
Yeah.

433
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:43,073
I saw her with Mooney,
but only for a day or two.

434
00:23:43,108 --> 00:23:45,576
Last I heard, she got a
job at The Narrows Bar.

435
00:23:46,573 --> 00:23:48,196
All right. Thanks.

436
00:24:16,675 --> 00:24:18,642
Who the hell are you?!

437
00:24:19,645 --> 00:24:21,645
You a cop?

438
00:24:22,681 --> 00:24:24,080
Nope.

439
00:24:24,116 --> 00:24:26,750
Well, if you're looking to rob
the place, you're too late.

440
00:24:26,785 --> 00:24:28,827
Fire took everything I had.

441
00:24:28,862 --> 00:24:30,862
I'm looking for someone.

442
00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:32,831
Her name's Alice.

443
00:24:32,866 --> 00:24:34,199
This some kind of joke?

444
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:36,660
No. What's funny?

445
00:24:36,703 --> 00:24:39,371
That crazy bitch is the
one who started the fire.

446
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,699
- Why'd she do that?
- How the hell do I know?!

447
00:24:42,734 --> 00:24:45,468
Said she cut herself. "Clean
yourself up then," I say.

448
00:24:45,504 --> 00:24:46,670
"You don't understand," she says.

449
00:24:46,705 --> 00:24:48,338
"My blood is on the
counter." Next thing I know,

450
00:24:48,373 --> 00:24:50,442
the whole damn kitchen's in flames.

451
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,976
Someone's got to pay for this damage.

452
00:24:53,011 --> 00:24:56,379
You tell me where she
is, my client will pay.

453
00:24:56,415 --> 00:24:58,581
- Who's your client?
- You know where she is?

454
00:24:58,617 --> 00:25:00,483
If I did, would I be talking to you?

455
00:25:02,187 --> 00:25:04,154
Thanks for your time.

456
00:25:04,189 --> 00:25:06,189
I say when we're done.

457
00:25:06,224 --> 00:25:08,858
Time to teach you some manners.

458
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,236
You had enough?

459
00:25:20,272 --> 00:25:21,871
Not yet.

460
00:25:27,746 --> 00:25:29,913
Now I have.

461
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:42,207
I'm sorry for the delay.

462
00:25:42,245 --> 00:25:44,260
Gotham Friday nights keep us busy.

463
00:25:44,296 --> 00:25:47,063
- How you feeling?
- Uh. I'll be fine.

464
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:48,798
Might want to take your shirt off.

465
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:50,266
Don't want to bloody it up.

466
00:25:59,555 --> 00:26:01,745
James Gordon, the policeman.

467
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,446
Used to be.

468
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,050
I don't need to tell you

469
00:26:07,085 --> 00:26:08,885
it's gonna hurt a little bit.

470
00:26:10,655 --> 00:26:12,322
There we go.

471
00:26:12,357 --> 00:26:14,457
Oh. Yeah.

472
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,701
Lee speaks very highly of you.

473
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,007
I'm Mario, Lee's fiancé.

474
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:37,313
That's nice of her.

475
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,383
Look, Jim,

476
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:42,819
I don't know where your
head's at with all this,

477
00:26:43,884 --> 00:26:46,256
but I want you to know
that I love her very much.

478
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,391
I'm gonna take good care of her.

479
00:26:51,129 --> 00:26:53,296
Good to know.

480
00:26:53,331 --> 00:26:55,465
So we're okay?

481
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,700
Yeah. sure.

482
00:26:57,736 --> 00:26:59,436
Why wouldn't we be?

483
00:26:59,471 --> 00:27:01,938
Lee and I are old news,
water under the bridge.

484
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,274
Won't get any problem from me.

485
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:08,778
Uh... wish you both
nothing but the best.

486
00:27:08,814 --> 00:27:10,647
Thank you.

487
00:27:10,682 --> 00:27:12,082
All done.

488
00:27:21,693 --> 00:27:23,660
But, uh...

489
00:27:23,695 --> 00:27:26,396
you ever were to hurt her,

490
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:29,138
I'd have to hunt you down and kill you.

491
00:27:33,538 --> 00:27:35,205
Hey, uh, look, um,

492
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,007
about three days ago, a
girl might have come in here

493
00:27:38,043 --> 00:27:39,309
with burns on her.

494
00:27:39,344 --> 00:27:41,010
Ring any bells? I need an address.

495
00:27:41,046 --> 00:27:42,320
Look familiar?

496
00:27:55,753 --> 00:27:58,094
A public place. Smart.

497
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,730
Knowing your flare for the dramatic,

498
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:01,998
I felt it necessary.

499
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:04,701
How flattering.

500
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,204
But why exert myself needlessly?

501
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,273
The public sees me as a man

502
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:12,542
of action, of change. You...

503
00:28:12,577 --> 00:28:16,045
You are yesterday's sad joke.

504
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:19,002
While Galavan humiliated
this city, where were you?

505
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:22,085
In a warehouse with a box on your head.

506
00:28:24,322 --> 00:28:25,955
You're an unstable lunatic, Penguin,

507
00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:28,691
and people are gonna
see right through you.

508
00:28:29,318 --> 00:28:32,529
I've got the judges,
the unions, the GCPD,

509
00:28:32,564 --> 00:28:34,731
and a whole team of
legal experts behind me.

510
00:28:34,766 --> 00:28:36,232
What do you got?

511
00:28:36,268 --> 00:28:38,001
I have me.

512
00:28:40,071 --> 00:28:42,772
You're psychotic!

513
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:50,446
Not this time, Penguin.

514
00:28:50,482 --> 00:28:52,615
My head will not be put in a box again.

515
00:28:54,986 --> 00:28:57,100
Oh, you.

516
00:28:57,139 --> 00:29:01,752
So smart. Always one step ahead.

517
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,300
Never three.

518
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:14,337
Relax. I do not want you dead.

519
00:29:14,372 --> 00:29:15,939
Besides, what kind of
fun would an election be

520
00:29:15,974 --> 00:29:19,145
if I were the only candidate, huh? Oh.

521
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:22,792
You're right about one thing, though.

522
00:29:22,814 --> 00:29:24,641
I do need a little help,

523
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:28,259
and I have just the
right person in mind.

524
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:34,332
Hello?

525
00:29:40,632 --> 00:29:41,965
Hello?

526
00:29:56,648 --> 00:29:59,824
No one lies to me! Don't lie!

527
00:30:03,388 --> 00:30:06,189
Any of his blood get on you?

528
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:07,357
No.

529
00:30:08,726 --> 00:30:10,106
Hello, Alice.

530
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,099
I wasn't sure how he turned.

531
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,906
Turned? What's wrong with him?

532
00:30:14,941 --> 00:30:16,708
He's infected.

533
00:30:16,743 --> 00:30:19,010
Infected with what?

534
00:30:19,045 --> 00:30:21,679
With me. Who are you?

535
00:30:21,715 --> 00:30:23,431
Why are you here?

536
00:30:23,444 --> 00:30:25,144
Your brother's looking for you.

537
00:30:27,878 --> 00:30:30,213
He can't... find me.

538
00:30:31,182 --> 00:30:33,049
Alice. Alice!

539
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:33,053
He's gone.

540
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,856
He's taken some of your clothes

541
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:37,458
and the keys to the Roller.

542
00:31:37,493 --> 00:31:39,326
Cut his hair, too.

543
00:31:39,362 --> 00:31:41,362
To look more like you.

544
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:45,199
We have to go after him.

545
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:47,601
I'm not sure

546
00:31:47,637 --> 00:31:51,030
who scheduled this
meeting, Mr. Cobblepot,

547
00:31:51,065 --> 00:31:53,841
but as you can see, I have been burdened

548
00:31:53,876 --> 00:31:56,343
with restoring order to this facility,

549
00:31:56,379 --> 00:31:59,046
and that is no easy task.

550
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:02,116
A man of your reputation
should not have been sent here

551
00:32:02,151 --> 00:32:03,550
to clean up Strange's wreckage.

552
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:04,785
Indeed.

553
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,021
Get off me! Let me go!

554
00:32:07,056 --> 00:32:09,823
You are aware of my ambitions?

555
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:11,792
For office?

556
00:32:11,827 --> 00:32:13,527
Oh.

557
00:32:13,562 --> 00:32:15,496
Once mayor, I will grant you

558
00:32:15,531 --> 00:32:18,299
whatever position you care to request.

559
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:20,100
Gotham's Head of Psychiatry,

560
00:32:20,136 --> 00:32:22,803
a chair on Gotham's Board of Health?

561
00:32:22,838 --> 00:32:24,471
In exchange for what exactly?

562
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:28,842
Even though my victory is inevitable,

563
00:32:28,878 --> 00:32:32,813
I fear my campaign is
missing one key element.

564
00:32:32,848 --> 00:32:35,683
A colleague of mine is
locked up here. Unfairly.

565
00:32:35,718 --> 00:32:39,186
Are you suggesting that I
release a convicted criminal

566
00:32:39,221 --> 00:32:40,788
out onto the street?

567
00:32:40,823 --> 00:32:43,757
Well, yes. For your betterment.

568
00:32:43,793 --> 00:32:45,592
That would take extensive

569
00:32:45,628 --> 00:32:47,926
patient analysis, uh,
probational hearings,

570
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,563
appeals...

571
00:32:49,598 --> 00:32:52,433
Lockdown is now in full effect.

572
00:32:52,468 --> 00:32:53,767
Repeat, lockdown...

573
00:32:53,803 --> 00:32:56,236
Of course, there's always plan B.

574
00:32:56,272 --> 00:32:58,772
I give you nothing...

575
00:32:58,808 --> 00:33:00,641
but I make sure you remain here forever.

576
00:33:00,676 --> 00:33:02,509
Not as a warden, no.

577
00:33:03,946 --> 00:33:06,513
I would see you scrub floors

578
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:07,881
and empty inmates' latrines.

579
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:08,982
Oh...

580
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,119
Options.

581
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,994
Look into my eyes.

582
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,296
Not around them,

583
00:33:22,365 --> 00:33:25,566
not above them, but into their center.

584
00:33:25,601 --> 00:33:29,036
Now sleep.

585
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:34,141
Now, what would we like to see

586
00:33:34,176 --> 00:33:35,609
the lovely Miss Kean do?

587
00:33:35,644 --> 00:33:37,778
Physical feats?

588
00:33:37,813 --> 00:33:39,913
A trip into her psyche?

589
00:33:39,949 --> 00:33:42,082
She said we needed more whimsy.

590
00:33:44,153 --> 00:33:46,387
Barbara?

591
00:33:46,422 --> 00:33:48,789
When I count down from three,

592
00:33:48,824 --> 00:33:50,124
you will find me irresistible.

593
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,092
You will be madly

594
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,127
in love with me.

595
00:33:54,697 --> 00:33:55,896
Three...

596
00:33:55,931 --> 00:33:57,664
two...

597
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,267
one.

598
00:34:00,302 --> 00:34:03,137
Barbara?

599
00:34:03,172 --> 00:34:04,605
Do you care for me?

600
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,839
Oh, yes.

601
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:08,339
Do you love me?

602
00:34:09,323 --> 00:34:11,578
Very much.

603
00:34:15,117 --> 00:34:16,717
- Ooh...
- But...

604
00:34:16,752 --> 00:34:19,205
what if I can't feel the same?

605
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:22,656
- Oh, dear.
- What if I love another?

606
00:34:22,691 --> 00:34:23,824
I'm sorry,

607
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:25,859
Barbara, my dear, but...

608
00:34:27,229 --> 00:34:31,265
Three, two, one, awake.

609
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,167
She's a bit sensitive to rejection.

610
00:34:35,953 --> 00:34:39,173
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great Jervis Tetch.

611
00:34:41,177 --> 00:34:43,210
Bravo!

612
00:34:55,832 --> 00:34:57,765
- Did you find her?
- I found her.

613
00:34:57,801 --> 00:34:59,267
Lost her.

614
00:34:59,302 --> 00:35:01,636
She shot a man and set fire to his body.

615
00:35:01,671 --> 00:35:03,137
Said she had an infection.

616
00:35:03,173 --> 00:35:04,839
Also said, she doesn't want anything

617
00:35:04,874 --> 00:35:06,307
to do with you.

618
00:35:06,343 --> 00:35:08,021
You want to tell me what
the hell is going on?

619
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,446
It's complicated.

620
00:35:11,481 --> 00:35:14,549
My next stop will be the GCPD.

621
00:35:14,584 --> 00:35:16,017
You can explain it to them.

622
00:35:16,052 --> 00:35:18,119
Please, don't do that.

623
00:35:18,154 --> 00:35:20,054
Let's talk somewhere private.

624
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,490
Allow me to explain the situation.

625
00:35:35,038 --> 00:35:36,271
So what does Alice have in her blood

626
00:35:36,306 --> 00:35:37,605
that makes it so infectious?

627
00:35:37,641 --> 00:35:39,140
She doesn't look sick to me.

628
00:35:40,176 --> 00:35:41,709
She's not sick.

629
00:35:41,745 --> 00:35:44,345
- She's powerful, sir.
- Powerful how?

630
00:35:44,381 --> 00:35:47,015
- I need answers, Tetch!
- You deserve some.

631
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,449
Do you hear my watch ticking?

632
00:35:50,453 --> 00:35:51,586
Yeah.

633
00:35:51,621 --> 00:35:54,022
Listen closer.

634
00:35:54,057 --> 00:35:55,390
The ticking,

635
00:35:55,425 --> 00:35:58,793
it synchronizes with
your heartbeat, yes?

636
00:36:02,098 --> 00:36:05,300
Look into my eyes.

637
00:36:05,335 --> 00:36:07,935
Not above them, or around them,

638
00:36:07,971 --> 00:36:09,804
into their center.

639
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,973
Are you asleep, Jim?

640
00:36:12,008 --> 00:36:13,141
Yes.

641
00:36:13,176 --> 00:36:14,342
Show me.

642
00:36:14,377 --> 00:36:17,011
Take out your gun and
put it on the ground.

643
00:36:25,455 --> 00:36:26,554
Good.

644
00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:28,256
Now walk to the edge

645
00:36:28,325 --> 00:36:29,757
and climb onto the wall.

646
00:36:33,863 --> 00:36:36,164
Been such a long,

647
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:39,167
hard road for you, Jim Gordon.

648
00:36:39,202 --> 00:36:43,871
You are so very tired
of life, aren't you?

649
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:45,907
Yes.

650
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:48,142
Now you can rest, Jim.

651
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:53,748
Close your eyes.

652
00:36:53,783 --> 00:36:56,250
Sleep forever.

653
00:37:09,471 --> 00:37:12,405
Deep down, you want to die, Jim.

654
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:16,030
You want to end this miserable,

655
00:37:16,081 --> 00:37:19,079
empty, loveless life, don't you?

656
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:20,802
- Yes!
- Yes.

657
00:37:20,828 --> 00:37:21,960
Let me help you.

658
00:37:21,995 --> 00:37:24,029
I'm going to count to ten.

659
00:37:24,064 --> 00:37:25,564
When I reach ten,

660
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,399
you will simply

661
00:37:27,434 --> 00:37:29,067
step off the ledge

662
00:37:29,103 --> 00:37:32,070
and you will find everlasting peace.

663
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:37,050
Ready? Yes.

664
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:39,544
One.

665
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,079
Two.

666
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:42,681
Three.

667
00:37:42,716 --> 00:37:44,015
Four.

668
00:37:44,051 --> 00:37:46,716
- Five.
- Stop!

669
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,066
Alice?

670
00:37:48,102 --> 00:37:49,267
Thank God!

671
00:37:49,303 --> 00:37:50,735
At last, I've found you!

672
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:52,504
Tell that man to get off the ledge.

673
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:53,572
Never mind him.

674
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:55,574
- Put down the gun.
- Mister!

675
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:56,741
Get down!

676
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:58,844
He can't hear you.

677
00:37:58,879 --> 00:37:59,911
Don't come near me.

678
00:38:02,182 --> 00:38:03,448
Why are you here

679
00:38:03,484 --> 00:38:04,950
if you don't want to talk?

680
00:38:06,753 --> 00:38:08,320
Put the gun down, Alice.

681
00:38:08,355 --> 00:38:09,888
You're evil.

682
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:11,356
Leave me alone!

683
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:12,916
Or I'll kill you!

684
00:38:14,394 --> 00:38:17,101
But, Alice, I love you.

685
00:38:44,057 --> 00:38:45,924
Thank you.

686
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:02,040
I'm sane.

687
00:39:02,075 --> 00:39:03,175
Absolutely.

688
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,710
100%. I examined you myself.

689
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:07,879
And the murder of Miss Kringle?

690
00:39:07,915 --> 00:39:09,447
Committed while you were insane.

691
00:39:09,483 --> 00:39:10,649
- Officer Dougherty.
- Insane.

692
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:11,950
- Officer Pinkney.
- Insane.

693
00:39:11,985 --> 00:39:13,418
- And now I'm...
- Sane.

694
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:16,288
And not responsible for any of the acts

695
00:39:16,323 --> 00:39:17,822
perpetrated during your sickness.

696
00:39:17,858 --> 00:39:20,225
You're a free man, Edward.

697
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,960
Not to look a gift horse in the mouth,

698
00:39:21,995 --> 00:39:23,628
but how did you...

699
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:33,305
Never mind.

700
00:39:36,777 --> 00:39:39,644
Hello, old friend.

701
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,033
Still thinking about
your meeting with Jim?

702
00:39:49,068 --> 00:39:50,067
No.

703
00:39:50,102 --> 00:39:51,569
There's nothing left to say.

704
00:39:51,604 --> 00:39:52,736
It's all in the past now.

705
00:39:52,772 --> 00:39:53,737
It's been less than a year.

706
00:39:53,773 --> 00:39:55,439
I think there's plenty to say.

707
00:39:55,475 --> 00:39:57,241
After all you went through with him,

708
00:39:57,276 --> 00:39:58,609
I just need to know that
nothing's left unsaid.

709
00:39:58,644 --> 00:40:00,845
Well, you should speak
to him yourself, then.

710
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,347
- I did.
- You did?

711
00:40:03,382 --> 00:40:05,115
- Mm-hmm.
- Something you could have mentioned

712
00:40:05,151 --> 00:40:06,684
the moment we sat down.

713
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:07,918
When? How?

714
00:40:07,954 --> 00:40:09,420
It's not like I wasn't gonna tell you.

715
00:40:09,455 --> 00:40:11,422
He came into the ER, he needed stitches.

716
00:40:11,457 --> 00:40:12,623
Of course.

717
00:40:12,658 --> 00:40:15,259
So I took the opportunity
to introduce myself.

718
00:40:15,294 --> 00:40:18,496
He didn't make the connection
at first, because, um...

719
00:40:18,531 --> 00:40:20,998
you hadn't told him my name.

720
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:24,168
It never came up.

721
00:40:25,204 --> 00:40:26,637
Right.

722
00:40:26,672 --> 00:40:28,572
What do you mean, "right"?

723
00:40:30,376 --> 00:40:32,443
Did I enter at a bad time?

724
00:40:35,948 --> 00:40:37,047
Glad you could make it, Dad.

725
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:39,250
I'm honored that you invited me.

726
00:40:46,939 --> 00:40:49,393
When Mario was born,

727
00:40:49,428 --> 00:40:50,794
I promised my wife

728
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,863
that he would never
be part of our thing.

729
00:40:52,899 --> 00:40:56,166
That we'd raise him to
lead a good, honest life.

730
00:40:56,202 --> 00:40:58,736
And we did.

731
00:40:58,771 --> 00:41:00,137
And he has.

732
00:41:01,207 --> 00:41:02,573
He can't use the Falcone name,

733
00:41:02,608 --> 00:41:05,175
but he's brought true
honor to the family.

734
00:41:05,211 --> 00:41:07,878
My wife is looking down on us now,

735
00:41:07,914 --> 00:41:09,346
and she's so proud and happy.

736
00:41:09,382 --> 00:41:10,514
She would love you, Lee.

737
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,983
You're exactly the kind of woman

738
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:14,685
she would have wished for her son.

739
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,654
Thank you.

740
00:41:16,689 --> 00:41:19,690
There's only one thing
that would've worried her.

741
00:41:19,725 --> 00:41:20,986
Oh?

742
00:41:21,497 --> 00:41:23,827
My wife would say you're
a little too beautiful.

743
00:41:25,392 --> 00:41:28,399
All the great tragedies
start with a face like yours.

744
00:41:30,092 --> 00:41:32,002
Makes men fall in love
when they shouldn't.

745
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:35,072
Makes them do crazy things.

746
00:41:35,107 --> 00:41:36,840
Dad, really?

747
00:41:36,876 --> 00:41:38,709
You're referring to Jim Gordon.

748
00:41:40,913 --> 00:41:42,880
I've spoken with him.

749
00:41:43,237 --> 00:41:45,049
He's moved on.

750
00:41:45,084 --> 00:41:46,850
I'm fine; he's fine.

751
00:41:46,886 --> 00:41:48,619
We both have.

752
00:41:48,654 --> 00:41:50,554
You've got nothing to worry about.

753
00:41:55,828 --> 00:41:57,294
Here's to both of you.

754
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,888
A blessed union.

755
00:42:27,927 --> 00:42:29,360
What the hell are you doing here?

756
00:42:29,395 --> 00:42:31,061
I wanted to apologize

757
00:42:31,097 --> 00:42:33,197
for the way I treated you last night.

758
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,968
I'm sorry. I was insensitive and rude.

759
00:42:38,004 --> 00:42:40,404
Hmm.

760
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:42,840
Does Alfred know you have his car?

761
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:44,274
No.

762
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,752
Why tell him? It's mine, not his.

763
00:42:48,276 --> 00:42:49,963
Would you like to go for a ride?

764
00:42:51,813 --> 00:42:53,250
Are you hungry?

765
00:42:53,285 --> 00:42:54,818
What's with you?

766
00:42:56,194 --> 00:42:58,122
You seem...

767
00:42:58,157 --> 00:43:00,057
different.

768
00:43:00,747 --> 00:43:02,331
Is that a bad thing?

769
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,095
Mm.

770
00:43:05,297 --> 00:43:06,730
I could eat.

771
00:43:08,534 --> 00:43:10,774
Don't wait up, losers.
