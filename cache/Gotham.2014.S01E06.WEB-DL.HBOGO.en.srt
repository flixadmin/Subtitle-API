1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,640
I am the Spirit of the Goat.

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,760
I am the Spirit of the Goat.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,560
I am the Spirit of the Goat.

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,560
I am the Spirit of the Goat.

5
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,560
<i>Gotham still held in a grip of terror
as the mysterious masked killer,</i>

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,400
<i>known as the Spirit of the Goat
remains on the loose.</i>

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,120
<i>But Gotham's Goat
hasn't cast his shadow,</i>

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,520
<i>over Thomas and Martha Wayne's
celebration,</i>

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,960
<i>of beloved son Bruce Wayne's
third birthday.</i>

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,280
<i>The Wayne family opened their home</i>

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,680
<i>to the children of the city orphanage
to share in the joyous day...</i>

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,760
Shelly.

13
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,440
That's the van registered
to Randall Milkie.

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,760
- We were right, Dix.
- Of course we're right.

15
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,840
Dispatch, Detective Dix,
requesting backup

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,360
at 1100 Cannery Drive.

17
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,080
<i>Roger.</i>

18
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,120
Come on, man. We gotta get in there.

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,840
Wait a second. Listen to me.

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
Wait a minute.

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,400
Listen to me.

22
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,640
Randall thinks he's the reincarnation

23
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,560
of some ancient murdering
goat spirit.

24
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,040
We are waiting for backup.

25
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,240
He's got Shelly Lawson in there.

26
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,680
If he kills her, that's three people
we lost to this maniac.

27
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,400
Gotham's golden rule, Harvey:
No heroes.

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,720
Son of a bitch.

29
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,640
Idiot, she's already dead.

30
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,920
- You don't know that.
- Yeah.

31
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
I know it.

32
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
I told you.

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,520
- Shelly.
- I told you she'd be cold.

34
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,840
She's been here half of the night.

35
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
Wait a minute.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,200
New candles, barely melted.

37
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
Just lit.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,400
That's great.

39
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,720
That's great news.

40
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,040
Randall Milkie, you're under arrest,

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,960
for the murders of Shelly Lawson,
Daniel Tremont and Edward Talbot.

42
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,160
Randall, be smart.

43
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,000
Come out of there, or we're gonna
have to blow you away.

44
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,280
Randall Milkie is undone.

45
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
Gone.

46
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,480
This body is moved
by the Spirit of the Goat.

47
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,000
We're gonna go with Milkie.

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,720
I already did the paperwork.

49
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,760
Dix!

50
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,720
You can never stop the Goat.

51
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,960
This body may fail, but I will not.

52
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,880
I will always come back.

53
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,880
I will always come back.

54
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,040
Come back from this.

55
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
Milkie.

56
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
Dix!

57
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,640
Dix.

58
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,000
Talk to me.

59
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,840
Talk to me. Dix, come on man.

60
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,440
Come on. Dix.

61
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
Help!

62
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,600
We got an officer down!
We need help, now!

63
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,760
Detective Bullock.

64
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,240
Detective Bullock, do you give up?

65
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,520
- What?
- My riddle.

66
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,120
{\an5}A man has to cross the river
with a wolf, a cabbage and a goat.

67
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,680
Ed, please, what's the time of death?

68
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,720
{\an5}Examiner pegs it
at just before 3.00am this morning.

69
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,640
{\an5}He's a bit eager
with his coagulation marker,

70
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,960
{\an5}so I'd put it at closer to one.

71
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,960
{\an5}Killer left her identification
for us.

72
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,160
Amanda Hastings, 21 years old.

73
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
She comes from money.

74
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,040
I'm guessing she was
the oldest in her family.

75
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,320
Why is that?

76
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,200
{\an5}The Goat always kills the firstborn.

77
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,200
It's all the same.

78
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,840
{\an5}Same MO, same victim choice,
presentation, it's all the same.

79
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
{\an5}We got a copycat.

80
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,040
{\an5}- You all right, detective?
- No, I'm not all right.

81
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,880
{\an5}I already solved this case.

82
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,840
{\an5}Where's Gordon?

83
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,560
{\an5}Apparently, he's not answering
his phone.

84
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
He's not answering his...

85
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,480
{\an5}You mean I'm on the clock
before the Boy Scout?

86
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,920
- This is frigging ridiculous.
- Fine, I'll tell you the answer.

87
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,240
{\an5}The man crosses the river
with the wolf and the cabbage.

88
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
{\an5}He leaves the wolf,

89
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,440
{\an5}- goes back with the cab...
- Ed.

90
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,440
I'm not apologizing for my past.

91
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,120
I'm not asking you to.
You're not listening.

92
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,440
No, you're not listening.

93
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,440
I'm not asking you to walk away
from this.

94
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,200
{\an5}Really? Because it sounds
like you are.

95
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,640
{\an5}And we keep going around and around,

96
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,520
and I keep telling you
I don't have a choice.

97
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
{\an5}Barbara...

98
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
{\an5}This city...

99
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,720
{\an5}...the law, the crime here,
they're all...

100
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,560
twisted up in each other
like a maze.

101
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,800
I came here to be a cop...

102
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,520
{\an5}but the city needs something else.

103
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
It's okay.

104
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,880
{\an5}I understand.

105
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,760
{\an5}I'm just asking for one thing.

106
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,280
{\an5}Half of what you have to carry.

107
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,280
{\an5}God knows I've dumped my half on you,
and you carry it.

108
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
Barbara, what I'm dealing with,
it's so dangerous.

109
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,040
{\an5}Half of what you carry.

110
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,280
{\an5}If you think I care about the risk,
then you're forgetting who I am.

111
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,960
I swear I'm not.

112
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
{\an5}Are we okay?

113
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
{\an5}Are we still fighting?

114
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,560
We're negotiating terms.

115
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,520
{\an5}That's not good for me.

116
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,800
You tell me what you're up against.

117
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
Okay?

118
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,360
{\an5}You let me in.

119
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
Then we're okay.

120
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
- That's work again.
- Yep.

121
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
I'll tell you everything.

122
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Everything I can.

123
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,200
Okay? I'll make it right.

124
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Okay.

125
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,440
There's the one, right there.

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,800
We've been canvassing
this waterfront for days, Monty.

127
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,480
None of these river rats
are gonna help us.

128
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,080
If we don't get a lead
in the next 24 hours,

129
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,600
MCU is dropping this.

130
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
Hey.

131
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,800
I'm on the disability six months.

132
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,120
Where do you expect me to go?

133
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,440
I'm not flushing you,
old-timer, okay?

134
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,720
Just wanna ask you some questions.

135
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,640
Yeah, about a shooting
that took place recently

136
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,840
on that pier back there.

137
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,720
A shooting? Yeah.

138
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,200
- I saw it good.
- Okay.

139
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,640
- Great. You ever see this man?
- That was the man did the shooting.

140
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,360
Cold customer,
ice water in the veins.

141
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,480
We got the son of a bitch.

142
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
We got Gordon.

143
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,560
- Gotham Goat?
- A wannabe.

144
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,560
For a copycat, the copy
is downright creepy, is what it is.

145
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,640
- You moonlighting or something?
- Me?

146
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,320
Yeah, because you're late,
and you look like crap warmed over.

147
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,960
- Write me up if you want.
- Screw you, Boy Scout.

148
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,240
You're in a good mood.

149
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,720
I'm in a déjà vu acid flashback.

150
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,040
Someone's hunting the kids
of Gotham's one percent.

151
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,520
The press will have a field day.

152
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,680
City turns upside down.

153
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,600
Whole thing's gonna come down
on the G.C.P.D.

154
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
like a ton of bricks.

155
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,000
Well then, let's catch him quick.

156
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,120
I'm guessing the killer knew
the victim, Amanda Hastings, somehow.

157
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
We'll go see the family,

158
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,320
see if we can try to get something
we can work with.

159
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
Hey, Nygma.

160
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,000
Let me know when they're set up
for the autopsy, all right.

161
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,600
Anything in particular
you want me to...

162
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
Just call me.

163
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,480
You see, the strange thing,
and the horrible thing,

164
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,160
is that I've been having
the same dream for weeks,

165
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,880
of a dark overbearing presence.

166
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,200
Mr. Hastings, about your daughter,

167
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,640
and we know that this is difficult,

168
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,760
but did she have anyone
in her life that worried you?

169
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,240
Anyone who might have
wished her harm?

170
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,680
Everybody loved my Amanda.

171
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,240
Mr. Hastings, are you all right?

172
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,520
Robert, if you need to take
a moment,

173
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,640
I'm sure it will be all right.

174
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Absolutely.

175
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Come on.

176
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,000
I know you gentlemen
are working against the clock,

177
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,680
but I'm afraid Mr. and Mrs. Hastings
might not be ready for this.

178
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,880
I can see that. And you are
the Hastings' therapist, Dr. Marks?

179
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,240
Yes. I treat mostly Mr. Hastings,
but we've had many family sessions.

180
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,800
Mr. Hastings
has a very delicate nature.

181
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,120
I'm afraid he's not at all capable
of dealing with this kind of tragedy.

182
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,400
No one's capable of dealing
with this kind of tragedy.

183
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,920
It's a freight train.

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,520
It runs you over,
and you try to pick up what's left.

185
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,960
You don't believe in treatment.

186
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,600
I believe in the tranquilizers
you clobbered Mrs. Hastings with.

187
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,360
- If you're giving out samples.
- Okay.

188
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,560
Detective, maybe we should...

189
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,960
Yeah, you're right, we should.

190
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
Excuse me.

191
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
Thank you, doctor.

192
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,080
All right, got it.

193
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,280
And got it. Yes, sir,
I'll bring those files right away.

194
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,560
- Mr. Nygma.
- Hello, Miss Kringle.

195
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,720
So, I'm just looking
for all the information

196
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,600
you have on the Goat murders
from 10 years ago.

197
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,360
Don't you find it curious,

198
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,080
why someone would resurrect
the myth of a centuries-old bogeyman?

199
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,200
And what is it about the Goat

200
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,400
that has made two people decide
to kill in his name?

201
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,160
No, I don't find it curious.

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
- I think I would like your parents.
- Excuse me?

203
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,560
Kringle.

204
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,200
Such a rare surname.

205
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,080
Most people changed it generations
ago out of embarrassment.

206
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,640
Not only did your parents keep it,
they called you Kristin.

207
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,240
Kristin Kringle.

208
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,680
They must be very humorous people.

209
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,800
Humor is so important,
don't you think?

210
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,360
Remember, you have to sign out
any evidence you pull.

211
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,000
How do you find anything
at all in here?

212
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,280
I mean, organizationally speaking,
this place is a shambles.

213
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,920
I am warning you, Nygma.

214
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,400
I have this as exactly as I wanted.

215
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,600
I know where everything is.

216
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
Understand?

217
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Preternaturally.

218
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
But...

219
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,400
I can help you, Kristin Kringle.

220
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,200
I doubt that very much.

221
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,120
There is a much better way
to do this.

222
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,440
Amanda Hastings was last seen

223
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,600
entering this building
Tuesday midnight.

224
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,400
That's about 36 hours ago.

225
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,280
You think she was abducted
from here?

226
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,920
I don't know.
It was Milkie's MO ten years ago.

227
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,240
He took each one of the victims
from their homes.

228
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,240
But CSI found no signs
of a break-in.

229
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,680
They didn't with Randall either.

230
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,760
He worked for an air-conditioning
maintenance crew,

231
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,880
that covered all three buildings.

232
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
He had keys?

233
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
He had keys.

234
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,720
This is Detective Gordon.

235
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,080
I need the employee list of every
maintenance and janitorial company,

236
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,640
with access
to the Hastings' building.

237
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,960
Yeah, I'll tell him.

238
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,400
They're ready for the autopsy.

239
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,600
- Mother.
- Away for so long,

240
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,280
and now he scratches at the door,
the filthy tomcat.

241
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,600
Hi, Mom. I'm alive.

242
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,720
Why you always think I'm running off
with some painted lady?

243
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
I don't even date.

244
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,200
Why you don't call your mother
in all this time?

245
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,400
I tell you why.

246
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,440
You got tangled
in some hussy's demon purse.

247
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,080
Mother, there was no hussy.

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,120
Only betrayal and savagery and...

249
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,560
All I wanted was a little respect.

250
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,200
And they hurt me so cruelly.

251
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,520
There was no other woman?

252
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,040
I have been to hell and back.
They tried to kill me.

253
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,360
The bullies again.

254
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,480
My poor, poor darling.

255
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,440
They only do these things
because they resent you.

256
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,240
Envy and spite...

257
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,040
that's all it is.

258
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,440
You watch, Ma.

259
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,280
I'm gonna be somebody in this town.

260
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,520
I always knew this.

261
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,560
The victim was asphyxiated,
likely with ether or chloroform.

262
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
Look under the scalp.

263
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Humor me.

264
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
At the base of the skull,

265
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,360
there'd be an incision
about an inch long, sewn closed.

266
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Wait a minute.

267
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
Yes.

268
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,760
How did I miss that?

269
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,720
An incision stitched closed
near the occipital.

270
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,920
Over a foreign object.

271
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,960
- What is it?
- It's a penny.

272
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
He's right.

273
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,960
- A penny?
- I know Milkie's MO.

274
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,880
No one could know that detail.

275
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,000
It isn't a copycat.

276
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
It can't be.

277
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,960
Ten years ago Randall Milkie
took an 1813 Liberty penny

278
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,440
just like this one,

279
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,800
and sewed it into the heads
of each of his victims.

280
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
Why?

281
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,520
How the hell do I know?

282
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,800
He bum-rushed me
wearing animal horns.

283
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,680
I shot him.
We didn't talk coin collecting.

284
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,760
You're sure no one else
could have found this out?

285
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,640
Milkie was the definition of a loner.

286
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,120
He didn't tell anybody.

287
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,040
We left it out of the file
intentionally.

288
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,240
- Suppressed evidence.
- We Easter-egged it.

289
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,960
We figured a killer like the Goat had
a good chance of drawing admirers.

290
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,440
Yeah, it's copycat porn.

291
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,800
We left out this one detail.

292
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,520
The coins. It never hit the papers.

293
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,080
How the hell did this copy-Goat
know about this?

294
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,920
Okay, so you hid it,

295
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
but the medical examiner,
he had to know.

296
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,520
Ed Hayes, yeah, sure.

297
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,080
But he died of cirrhosis.

298
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,800
- That just leaves me.
- And Dix.

299
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,320
Captain, please,
there's no reason...

300
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,600
Go talk to him.

301
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,160
Make sure he didn't tell anyone
about the coins.

302
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,960
Hell, see if he's got any ideas.

303
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,080
<i>I'm Lacey White, and this
is the Gotham Seven Goatwatch.</i>

304
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,040
<i>Tonight, Gotham's wealthiest
one percent rest fitfully,</i>

305
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,760
<i>under a copycat killer's
deadly shadow.</i>

306
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,160
<i>And if you happen to be</i>

307
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,320
<i>one of the city's
high-society silver spoons,</i>

308
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,120
<i>then you're probably headed
to the Swiss Alps right now</i>

309
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,320
<i>and away from...</i>

310
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,160
They've got them all running
like rabbits.

311
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,360
Yeah.

312
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,320
I don't know why he chose
an ungulate for his totem,

313
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,520
but he does know how to scare them.

314
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,240
You do realize
you happen to be one of them,

315
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
don't you, Master Bruce?

316
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,880
Yeah, a firstborn son of Gotham's
rich and powerful.

317
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,640
I don't know, maybe we should leave
town for a little bit.

318
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,240
Pop down to the lake house.
You like it there, don't you?

319
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,320
I'm not going anywhere.

320
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
I have work to do.

321
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,160
Besides, why would the Goat take me?

322
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,760
There's no one to take me from.

323
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,320
- Oh, my God.
- I'm improving your system.

324
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,440
Implementing a rhizomatic
cross index,

325
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,200
with your case files classified
by subject,

326
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,840
but arranged more like the way
a peat-moss organism grows.

327
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,200
You know, laterally.

328
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,960
- I had this entire room organized.
- Yes, but now it will be rhizomatic.

329
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
Lateral.

330
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,440
What did I ever do to you, Nygma?

331
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,040
What did I do that compels you
to come here

332
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,280
with your endless notes suggestions
and riddles?

333
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,440
My God, the riddles.

334
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,720
Are you trying to get me to quit?

335
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,240
- You can't want my job.
- No, no, no. I want you.

336
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,880
To keep your job and to have it here,
for working.

337
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
Okay.

338
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm getting a sense that
this was somehow inappropriate.

339
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,320
You are so odd.

340
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,400
I'll just take my nonhierarchical
data paradigms out of your hair...

341
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,720
and leave you to your work.

342
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,840
How long has it been
since you've seen this guy?

343
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,880
Look, Bullock, I know what happened.

344
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,960
- Anybody in your situation...
- Listen.

345
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,480
You think you can shrink my head,
Boy Scout?

346
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,640
Because you can't.

347
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,800
This is the black box, man.

348
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,440
And we don't open the black box,
ever.

349
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
Okay, fine.

350
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,880
Why don't you sit your ass down?
I'll be back in a few minutes.

351
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,120
We're both on this case.

352
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,600
- Dix.
- Hey.

353
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,440
What do we have here?

354
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,720
Harvey Bullock, boy detective.

355
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,960
Look at you up there, huh,
living the high life?

356
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,800
And me down here,
all broken up with a busted liver.

357
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,720
Don't put that on me, old man.

358
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,600
Your bum liver's between you
and the bottle.

359
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,800
I just busted up your gams
and put you in that chair.

360
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,160
Gotham's golden rule...

361
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,280
- No heroes, Bullock.
- No heroes.

362
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,520
Listen, Dix, we have to talk
about the case.

363
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
About the Goat.

364
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,440
I was wondering when you were going
come and ask for my help.

365
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,880
- I'm not asking for your help.
- That don't mean you don't need it.

366
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,920
Who's this? Your partner?

367
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,160
- James Gordon. Nice to meet you.
- Come on, Dix.

368
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,600
Did you ever tell anyone
about Randall Milkie?

369
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,760
The Liberty head pennies?

370
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,840
We said we weren't going to.
We sealed them.

371
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,040
I know we sealed them, you jackass.

372
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,560
I told you to seal them.

373
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,960
Okay, but this new killer's
doing the same thing.

374
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,320
He's stitching up coins
in the heads of his victims.

375
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,960
Any idea how he came up with that?

376
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,040
I didn't tell anybody.

377
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,640
Ed Hayes didn't tell nobody.

378
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,600
And you didn't tell nobody.

379
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,520
So, what the hell does that mean?

380
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
It means we were wrong about Milkie.

381
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,760
- He was not working alone.
- No.

382
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,120
You do not have
a copycat killer here.

383
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,880
You do not have a lone killer.

384
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,200
What you have...

385
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
is a conspiracy.

386
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,960
A conspiracy to hang rich kids off
local historical landmarks?

387
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,080
Yeah, right.

388
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,680
He always thinks
he's the smartest one in the room.

389
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,480
I know, right?

390
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
That's because I'm always
in a room full of idiots.

391
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
Watch out for him.

392
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,760
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

393
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,560
He's a loose cannon.

394
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,440
He thinks he's a white knight,
jumping into the breach,

395
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,440
like some idiot in the movies.

396
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,440
We talking about Bullock here?

397
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,480
We're talking about Bullock here.

398
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,960
- Harvey Bullock?
- Harvey Bullock.

399
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,600
Detective Bullock, do you want
to settle the bill for this month now

400
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,000
or should we send it to you?

401
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,600
You can just put it in the mail,
thanks.

402
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,000
Is he getting those magazines
I ordered?

403
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,200
Those are awful magazines, detective.

404
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,840
- But he's getting them?
- Yes, he is.

405
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Good.

406
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,320
Thank you.

407
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,240
No, Mom, I'm just grabbing
a few things. Yes.

408
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
Yes, I know.

409
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,120
I'll be at the marina at 9.00.

410
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Okay.

411
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,000
- Here you are.
- Thank you, Anita.

412
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,280
Will you put some snack snuff
together, please?

413
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
Miss Ember?

414
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,600
Anita, have you seen
the tops to my yellow silk...

415
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Anita?

416
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,120
Ember Copley was supposed
to meet her parents

417
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,840
tonight at 9.00 at the marina.

418
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,960
When she didn't show, they came back,
found the maid out cold, Ember gone.

419
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,400
- You think it's our guy?
- It's our guy.

420
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,280
He slips in, chloroforms the maid,
grabs Ember.

421
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,560
No sign of B and E,
nothing, like a ghost.

422
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,720
Like he had keys.

423
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,000
Randall Milkie had a ritual.

424
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,000
Dress the victims, kill them,
do his coin trick.

425
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,360
Whole thing took about eight hours.

426
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,280
If our copy-Goat's
doing the same thing,

427
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
we're running out of time.

428
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,640
I pulled the employee list
from the agencies

429
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,400
that do maintenance
on Ember Copley's building.

430
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,840
Looking for an employee that had
access to both victims' apartments.

431
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,800
That's a hell of a lot of people.

432
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,520
<i>Yeah, but our guy's been real busy.</i>

433
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,480
He had to have called in sick
the last couple days.

434
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,720
Get Nygma in there.

435
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,200
He's freaky good with puzzles.

436
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
<i>You got it.</i>

437
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,960
- Renee, we have to talk.
- What are you doing here?

438
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,080
Look, I know you think
he's done terrible things,

439
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,360
but I also know you care
about the truth.

440
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,240
You shouldn't be here.
Barbara, you shouldn't be seen here.

441
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,880
Damn it, Renee,
will you listen to me?

442
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,800
Look, I'll work with you, okay?

443
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,760
I will tell you whatever I know,
whatever I can find out.

444
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,600
I need you to keep an open mind,
okay?

445
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,800
It's too late for that.

446
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,480
Whatever's happening,
you've got it wrong, Renee.

447
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,080
He can't tell me, I know that,
but it isn't what you think.

448
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,840
He's trying to protect me.

449
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,280
He won't tell me who's out there,
who he's afraid of.

450
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,840
He's right not to.

451
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,160
- Wait, why?
- Because it'll get you killed.

452
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,920
Okay? You understand?

453
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,360
What he knows, who he knows,
will kill you.

454
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,680
We got a judge issuing
a warrant tonight.

455
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,840
Barbara, you know how much
I care about you.

456
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,280
When Gordon gets arrested,
you have to get out of here.

457
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,280
If Jim gets arrested,

458
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,120
then this is exactly
where I have to be, by his side.

459
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,000
Please, just leave.

460
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,120
Get out of Gotham
just till this is over.

461
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,160
And don't come to me again.

462
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,080
Okay, so four guys have called
in sick since last week.

463
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,040
The two suspects from
the outer boroughs are cleared,

464
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,600
another is out of state,

465
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,760
but apparently,
it's unconfirmed, so...

466
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,360
- So that leaves one last guy.
- Raymond Earl.

467
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,000
Shift supervisor says
he's been squatting in a place,

468
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,120
near Cannery Park somewhere
around the 1100 block.

469
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,600
- That's him.
- You sure?

470
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,760
Yeah, I'm sure.

471
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,080
I'm 100 percent sure.

472
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,920
Déjà voodoo all day long.

473
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,920
This is where we got Randall Milkie
ten years ago.

474
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,440
This is where Dix fell.

475
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
Bullock.

476
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,000
Gotta go in. Come on.

477
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,840
Yeah. Yeah.

478
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,720
We're going to put you to sleep
for good now.

479
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,400
You're lucky to be the sacrifice.

480
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
Go get her.

481
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,440
It's okay. You're safe.

482
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
You all right?

483
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
Okay.

484
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,280
You'll never stop the Goat.

485
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,000
- I will always come back.
- Quit saying that.

486
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,880
Raymond Earl, you're under arrest.

487
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
Not bad.

488
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,040
All right.

489
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
All right.

490
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,080
Your suit is ready.

491
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,560
I steamed it nice.

492
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,640
Thanks, Mom.

493
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,040
I'm worried for you.

494
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,080
So anxious you look.

495
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,720
These moves you make,
they're safe, yes?

496
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,280
- You're not doing anything illegal?
- No, Mom, don't worry.

497
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,320
- It's just business.
- Well, business is all very fine.

498
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,120
But always remember,
you can trust no one.

499
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,840
No one but your mother.

500
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,680
I know. I know.

501
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,640
But you know what?

502
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,760
I think I finally found somebody
I can trust.

503
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,080
- A policeman.
- Police?

504
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,080
- The police are liars.
- Not this one, Mom.

505
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,240
He's a real friend.

506
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,280
He'll help me come out
right in the end.

507
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,280
Raymond Earl, 33 years old.

508
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,360
Janitor in the city.

509
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,000
Works with an agency that services
the buildings of both victims.

510
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,320
And he's not talking.

511
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
History of mental illness,
misdemeanor arrest

512
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,840
for lewd and lascivious,
public disturbance...

513
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,880
Thank you, Jesus. You got him.

514
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,080
Good work, detectives.

515
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,800
I got a lot of phone calls to make.

516
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,520
Bullock, look happier.

517
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,680
What?

518
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,320
Randall Milkie worked
for a maintenance company

519
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,600
that serviced the buildings
of his victims.

520
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,840
Same as Raymond here.

521
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,880
Milkie was mentally ill.

522
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,600
No violent crimes in his history.

523
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,680
Same as him.

524
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,000
Ten years apart, they never meet,

525
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,960
and one day,
suddenly out of the blue,

526
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,680
they both decide to become the Goat?

527
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
It's like...

528
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,400
It's like something found them,
changed them.

529
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,560
Are you talking about Dix
and his conspiracy theory?

530
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,600
No, no. It just doesn't add up.

531
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,160
How'd he know about the coin?

532
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,280
I know that I'm missing something,
and if we keep missing it,

533
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,480
I'm afraid we're never gonna
stop this.

534
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,720
Okay. We go back to Milkie's files,

535
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,240
we look for possible accomplices,
connections.

536
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,320
Tomorrow, tomorrow.

537
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,240
I just... I need to think.

538
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,760
Why don't you get some rest?

539
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Yeah.

540
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
Good night.

541
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,080
Good night, Jim.

542
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,520
No.

543
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,880
No.

544
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,720
No. No.

545
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,120
Oh, no.

546
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,440
No. No.

547
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,280
No. No.

548
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,280
Holy Ghost on a bicycle.

549
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,800
Barbara?

550
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,440
Jim, look, I don't know everything,
but I know enough.

551
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,520
You have to listen to me now.

552
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,160
- Baby, I can barely stand.
- Montoya has a witness.

553
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,120
- What?
- They believe you killed,

554
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,400
this Cobblepot person.

555
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,520
- I didn't.
- It doesn't matter anymore.

556
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,080
They've got a warrant
for your arrest.

557
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,960
What aren't you telling me?

558
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,160
For weeks now, it's like
you've been a different person.

559
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,200
Something happened not long after you
started the job, something...

560
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,000
Something you don't feel right about.

561
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,240
Somehow they've cornered me.

562
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,000
- Tied my hands.
- Come with me now.

563
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,960
I don't care what I leave behind
as long as we leave it together.

564
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,760
If they take you away, Jim,
I'm scared I'll lose you.

565
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,560
- Barbara...
- Please.

566
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,080
I can't run.

567
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
Can't run.

568
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
James Gordon,

569
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,880
you're under arrest for the murder
of Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot.

570
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,120
You have the right to remain silent.

571
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,480
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

572
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,600
You're drifting down and away,
deeper...

573
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,400
- I got it.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

574
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,920
- It's Detective Bullock, isn't it?
- Yeah.

575
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,040
Did you wanna interview Mr. Hastings?

576
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,400
Actually, your secretary told me
I might be able to find you here.

577
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,440
I was hoping to pick your brain
about the case.

578
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,320
I'll just be a minute. It's okay.

579
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,960
I didn't realize this before.

580
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,080
You're a hypnotist, right?

581
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,760
- A hypnotherapist.
- Oh, therapist.

582
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,080
It's a funny word, "therapist."

583
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,680
It can either mean "therapist"
or "the rapist" if...

584
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,880
So you do pro bono work

585
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,400
at an outpatient clinic
or a couple of them?

586
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,920
I do. I try to give back.

587
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,120
Yeah, you've been giving back
for a while.

588
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,400
Twelve years now.

589
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
That's good.

590
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,080
To be honest, I wanted to talk to you
about one of your pro bono patients.

591
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,280
Raymond Earl.

592
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,960
He's a person of interest
in our investigation.

593
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,400
Our records indicate you've seen him
at least a few times, right?

594
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,480
Sounds familiar.

595
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,040
Last year, maybe?

596
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,520
And Mr. Hastings, Amanda's father,
we know he's your patient.

597
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
When we were here yesterday,

598
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,880
he was doing something
really curious.

599
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,000
He kept clenching his fist,
over and over.

600
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,960
- Yes, he does that.
- Yeah.

601
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,120
See, I was reading about that,

602
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,000
and it said that if a patient
has a compulsion,

603
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,360
like a bad idea or an impulse,

604
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,120
that the hypnotist
can put the poor sap under,

605
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,440
and introduce a physical movement,
like clenching your fist.

606
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,960
So instead of doing what the
compulsion wants the person to do,

607
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,080
they just, clench their fist.

608
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,800
That's how it works. Pretty much.

609
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,560
So Mr. Hastings,
when he's in a room full of people,

610
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,280
and he wants to start screaming
his head off, I don't know,

611
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,760
instead of doing that, he just...

612
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,840
Yeah. Okay.

613
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,720
What about Raymond Earl?

614
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,040
Why does he clench his fist?

615
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,440
And what about Randall Milkie?

616
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,160
See, I know you treated him
over ten years ago,

617
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,640
and I want you to follow me,
because this part gets weird.

618
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,760
See, I think a hypnotist completely
turned both those men upside down,

619
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,960
until their own identity
was the bad idea,

620
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,640
and then it wasn't even them
clenching their fists anymore.

621
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,360
It was the Spirit of the Goat.

622
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,320
I underestimated you.

623
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,920
I really did.

624
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,640
So I'm right.

625
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,680
Yes. I'm right.

626
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,760
So you trawled
all the outpatient clinics,

627
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,160
so you could find a suitable
borderline case like Randall Milkie,

628
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,960
and then you hypnotize
the poor bastard

629
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,120
until he doesn't even know who he is.

630
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,000
And then I tell him who he is.

631
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,560
That's pretty good intellection,
detective.

632
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,240
Why?

633
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,000
Why hypnotize a janitor,

634
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,840
and turn him into the Goat?

635
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,960
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

636
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,480
It isn't an act of murder or madness.
It's an act of therapy.

637
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,800
- Therapy? For who?
- For Gotham.

638
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,720
Excuse me?

639
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,120
This city used to have hope.

640
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,600
And they gunned it down
in the streets,

641
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,400
the rich, the powerful.

642
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,440
Their greed is pathological,

643
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,320
an id run rampant,
eating Gotham alive.

644
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,960
So your one percent solution
is to kill the city's rich kids?

645
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,240
Negative reinforcement.

646
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,600
To believe that the Goat is real,
that it wouldn't tolerate this?

647
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,520
Gotham wanted that,
no matter how painful it was.

648
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,720
It's true what they say.

649
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,440
You can't really hypnotize somebody
to do something,

650
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,760
that deep down
they don't already want to do.

651
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,760
And deep down
we all wanna eat the rich.

652
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,720
Tell me.

653
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,960
You are 100 percent nuthouse crazy,
lady.

654
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,520
- Dr. Marks, is everything okay?
- No, it's not.

655
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,160
Dr. Marks, you're under arrest for
conspiracy to commit murder coercion,

656
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,760
and a few things we'll probably
have to name after you.

657
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,560
Well, I do have another one for you.

658
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,000
Robert, the golden temple is open.

659
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,440
Now, kill this man.

660
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
No, Robert...

661
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,440
Heel, Mr. Hastings! Heel!

662
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
Freeze, lady!

663
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,800
One more time, take me through
the part where you drove

664
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,440
to the nice part of town,
and shot the doctor lady?

665
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,920
We caught the other half
of the killer.

666
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,840
Dr. Marks was the Spirit of the Goat.

667
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,320
Okay, see,
that's the part that I don't...

668
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,240
We're on the same side.
You understand?

669
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,120
We're fighting the same war,
and damn it, I'm getting somewhere.

670
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,080
Getting into a six-by-eight
at Blackgate Pen,

671
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,200
that's what you're getting.

672
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,440
What is this?

673
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,400
MCU's taking Detective James Gordon
in custody.

674
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,800
- What?
- Your boy here

675
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,040
murdered Oswald Cobblepot
and dumped him in the river.

676
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,160
- That's a damn lie.
- He's right. It was a lie.

677
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,760
I didn't shoot Oswald Cobblepot.

678
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,000
I lied.

679
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,600
- I didn't shoot him, Bullock.
- Of course you didn't, partner.

680
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,800
No, I mean it.

681
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,080
Harvey Bullock, you're under arrest.

682
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,680
- For what?
- Accomplice in the murder

683
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,200
of Oswald Cobblepot.

684
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,120
Our witness places you at the scene.

685
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,800
You think you can walk in here
and take my people like that?

686
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,680
We're not here to take down
the G.C.P.D., we just want these two.

687
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,400
Well, they're G.C.P.D.,
so the MCU's got a problem.

688
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,320
Yeah, you got a problem.
You got a real problem, you...

689
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
Holy crap.

690
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Hello.

691
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,760
I am Oswald Cobblepot.

692
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,640
- You son of a bitch.
- Harvey.

693
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,920
You son of a bitch!
