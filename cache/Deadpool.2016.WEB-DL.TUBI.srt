Nothing warms my heart more than a change of someone else's.

835
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,906
You finally hit "fuck it."

836
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,642
Just promise you'll do right by me.

837
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:20,711
So I can do right by someone else.

838
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,613
Of course.

839
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,515
And please don't make the super-suit green.

840
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,084
Or animated.

This place seems sanitary.

845
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,343
My first request is warmer hands.

846

Oh! And, Jesus, a warmer table.

847
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,017
We should really come up with a safe word, fellas.

848

I'm thinking "pork and beans."

(GROANS) Easy.

Aren't you a little strong for a lady?

Are you here for the turndown service, or what?

We have another talker.

I'm just excited about my first day at superhero camp.

I manage this workshop.

Ah, my welcome speech used to be full of euphemisms like...

865
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,701
"This may hurt a little."

866
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,770
"This may cause you some discomfort."

867

But I've grown blunt.

868

This workshop is not a government-led program.

It's a private institution that turns reclamation projects like yourself...

into men of extraordinary abilities.

871

Wrong. (GROANS)

I'm injecting you with a serum...

874

that activates any mutant genes lurking in your DNA.

875
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:20,331

I was a patient here once myself, you know.

The treatment affects everyone differently.

881
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:41,452
It made Angel inhumanly strong.

882
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:46,056
In my case, it enhanced my reflexes.

883
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:49,059
Also scorched my nerve endings, so I no longer feel pain.

884
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:54,698
And, in fact, I no longer feel anything.

You have something in your teeth.

Hey, is Ajax your actual name?

895
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,795
Because it sounds suspiciously made up.

lower the oxygen concentration in the air...

You don't need to be a superhero to get the girl.

1821
01:40:32,526 --> 01:40:35,796
The right girl will bring out the hero in you.

1822
01:40:35,829 --> 01:40:39,433
Now, let's finish this epic wide shot. Pull out.

1823
01:40:39,466 --> 01:40:41,135
There we go, that looks nice.

1824
01:40:41,168 --> 01:40:42,269
That's gonna be about the only thing

1825
01:40:42,302 --> 01:40:43,570
that's pulling out tonight.

1826
01:40:43,604 --> 01:40:46,774
Who doesn't love a happy ending, huh?

1827
01:40:46,807 --> 01:40:48,475
'Til next time, this is

1828
01:40:48,509 --> 01:40:50,677
your friendly neighborhood pool guy singin'...

1829
01:40:50,711 --> 01:40:53,180
♪ I'm never gonna dance again

1830
01:40:53,213 --> 01:40:56,617
♪ The way I danced with you

1831
01:46:52,038 --> 01:46:55,041
Captioned by Deluxe

1832
01:47:06,586 --> 01:47:08,088
You're still here?

1833
01:47:10,757 --> 01:47:13,794
It's over. Go home.

1834
01:47:15,562 --> 01:47:17,998
Oh, you're expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2.

1835
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:20,834
Well, we don't have that kind of money.

1836
01:47:20,867 --> 01:47:23,870
What are you expecting? Sam Jackson to show up?

1837
01:47:23,904 --> 01:47:26,673
With an eye patch and a saucy little leather number?

1838
01:47:26,706 --> 01:47:28,208
Go. Go.

1839
01:47:33,613 --> 01:47:35,215
Oh.

1840
01:47:35,248 --> 01:47:37,117
But I can tell you one thing, and it's a bit of a secret.

1841
01:47:37,150 --> 01:47:40,253
For the sequel, we're gonna have Cable.

1842
01:47:40,287 --> 01:47:42,823
Amazing character. Bionic arm, time travel.

1843
01:47:42,856 --> 01:47:43,990
We have no idea who we're gonna cast yet,

1844
01:47:44,024 --> 01:47:45,258
but it could be anybody.

1845
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:46,760
Just need a big guy with a flat top.

1846
01:47:46,793 --> 01:47:48,562
Could be Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren...

1847
01:47:48,595 --> 01:47:50,997
Keira Knightley. She's got range. Who knows.

1848
01:47:51,031 --> 01:47:52,699
Anyway, big secret. Shh...

1849
01:47:52,732 --> 01:47:54,601
Oh, and don't leave your garbage all lying around.

1850
01:47:54,634 --> 01:47:56,970
It's a total dick move.

1851
01:47:57,938 --> 01:47:59,005
Go.

1852
01:48:01,274 --> 01:48:03,076
