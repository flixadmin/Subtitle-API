1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:02,646
<i>Previously on Gotham...</i>

2
00:00:02,857 --> 00:00:04,691
I need to siphon his strength

3
00:00:04,725 --> 00:00:06,393
so when the time is right,

4
00:00:06,414 --> 00:00:08,072
<i>taking over his organization will be</i>

5
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:10,148
<i>like slipping on a glove.</i>

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,553
<i>The point wasn't to
steal that money, Butch.</i>

7
00:00:12,617 --> 00:00:14,235
It was to hurt Falcone.

8
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:16,536
<i>- What's her name?
- Selina Kyle.</i>

9
00:00:16,664 --> 00:00:19,139
<i>- So, she saw everything?
- Yes.</i>

10
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:21,408
Her being here will put
Master Bruce in great danger.

11
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:23,009
She's also the best chance we have

12
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:24,477
of finding who killed my parents.

13
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:27,347
You are gonna keep working for Fish.

14
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:29,649
You are gonna tell me

15
00:00:29,684 --> 00:00:32,586
every little thing that she says.

16
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,260
Lovecraft, I have an eyewitness
who can tie you to the crime.

17
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:37,824
You and all the others involved.

18
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:40,594
So, tell me, Dent, who did I kill?

19
00:00:40,628 --> 00:00:41,862
Thomas and Martha Wayne.

20
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:54,674
You lost, miss?

21
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:56,343
This is Wayne Manor?

22
00:00:56,377 --> 00:00:58,845
Yeah, but not sure you should be here.

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,882
Point you back to the road if you're lost.
No, thanks.

24
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:04,396
I am where I need to be.

25
00:01:08,823 --> 00:01:11,424
Shh...

26
00:01:17,298 --> 00:01:18,632
Open him.

27
00:01:51,265 --> 00:01:53,366
Keep it tight here.

28
00:02:03,177 --> 00:02:04,678
Better?

29
00:02:06,214 --> 00:02:08,215
Better.

30
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:12,686
If you want to test yourself,

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,921
you should come with me
to the Midtown Bridge.

32
00:02:14,956 --> 00:02:16,189
You've climbed it?

33
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:17,290
Yeah, to the top.

34
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:18,825
Kids go up there to make out.

35
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,860
All the time.

36
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:21,628
I could take you, if you want.

37
00:02:21,662 --> 00:02:23,029
Okay.

38
00:02:23,064 --> 00:02:24,464
I'd like that.

39
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:27,934
Let me ask you a question.

40
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:32,506
What's up with all the weird
homework about your mom and dad?

41
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,342
I'm trying to understand why it happened.

42
00:02:35,376 --> 00:02:36,943
There's no why.

43
00:02:36,978 --> 00:02:38,545
Bad stuff happens.

44
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:40,855
You-you got to get over it.

45
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:42,949
Maybe you're right.

46
00:02:42,984 --> 00:02:44,584
Of course I'm right.

47
00:02:46,187 --> 00:02:47,954
You want to kiss me?

48
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:50,557
No, thank you.

49
00:02:52,593 --> 00:02:53,827
No?

50
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:55,495
I would like to,

51
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,697
but I can't help feeling
you have an ulterior motive.

52
00:02:57,732 --> 00:02:59,699
I don't imagine you consider me

53
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:02,202
a suitable romantic partner, so
why would you want to kiss me?

54
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:03,236
I don't know.

55
00:03:03,237 --> 00:03:06,473
You think too much, kid.

56
00:03:06,507 --> 00:03:08,175
I'm just trying to be nice.

57
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:12,345
No offense, you don't
strike me as a nice person.

58
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,580
What do you mean?

59
00:03:13,614 --> 00:03:15,682
I'm nice.

60
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:18,084
I don't mean you're not a good
person, but you're not nice.

61
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:21,321
You don't care much for other people.

62
00:03:21,355 --> 00:03:23,457
Screw you, orphan.

63
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:26,660
Climb the damn bridge on your own.

64
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:34,146
Yes, hello, miss. How can I help?

65
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,537
Oh, dear.

66
00:03:37,572 --> 00:03:40,073
My car, it went off the road.

67
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:41,575
Please...

68
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:44,544
Please come in. Come in at once.

69
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,380
If you could call an ambulance.

70
00:03:47,415 --> 00:03:49,783
Where exactly are you hurt?

71
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:51,952
Alfred.

72
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,354
Is everything all right?

73
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:55,756
No, Master Bruce.

74
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,225
This lady's been involved
in a car accident.

75
00:04:00,428 --> 00:04:02,462
Run. Run!

76
00:04:19,747 --> 00:04:21,114
This better be a way out.

77
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,816
The old servant's hallway,
it's through the closet.

78
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,117
But I need to help Alfred!

79
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:25,285
There's no time!

80
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:06,126
Bruce, come on!

81
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
Alfred might be hurt.

82
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:08,161
I can't leave him.

83
00:05:18,673 --> 00:05:20,674
He told you to run.

84
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:23,643
Fine.

85
00:05:23,678 --> 00:05:26,213
Stay, but I'm out.

86
00:05:52,073 --> 00:05:54,408
Bruce!

87
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:02,516
Local PD is searching the woods,

88
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,384
but so far no sign of Bruce or Selina.

89
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:06,720
What can you tell me about this woman?

90
00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:09,089
Well, she was, uh, early 30s.

91
00:06:09,123 --> 00:06:10,757
A tasty fighter, actually.

92
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:12,859
Look, mate, it's just a scratch.

93
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:14,594
Shove off, will you?

94
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:16,496
I've got stuff to do.

95
00:06:16,531 --> 00:06:20,000
Look, we've got 50 police in the
woods, even more on the roads.

96
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:22,035
We need to focus on this
woman and her people.

97
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,503
What can you tell me about her?

98
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:25,372
They were trained killers.

99
00:06:25,406 --> 00:06:27,374
And your bloody little
girl brought them here.

100
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:28,608
We don't know that yet.

101
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:29,876
Jim.

102
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:32,512
You must be Alfred Pennyworth.

103
00:06:32,547 --> 00:06:34,081
Nice job out there.

104
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:35,615
Yeah, well, not nice enough, eh?

105
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,084
This was taken off the dead guy.

106
00:06:37,118 --> 00:06:39,186
Nothing else... no keys, no I.D., nada.

107
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,854
Now, I know this girl.

108
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:42,889
She was grabbed by the child snatchers.

109
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:44,791
And now she's getting attacked by assassins

110
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:46,860
at Wayne freaking Manor?!

111
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:49,062
What the hell's going on, compadre?

112
00:06:49,097 --> 00:06:50,097
What, you haven't told him?

113
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:52,065
Told me what?

114
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,568
Selina Kyle was in the alley the
night the Waynes were murdered.

115
00:06:54,602 --> 00:06:56,570
She saw the killer's face.

116
00:06:56,604 --> 00:06:58,972
Oh, for Pete's sake, don't do this to me.

117
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:01,441
Harvey Dent in the D.A.'s office
is investigating Dick Lovecraft.

118
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:04,144
He thinks that Lovecraft is
connected to the Wayne killings.

119
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:06,280
So, he leaked that we had a witness.

120
00:07:06,314 --> 00:07:08,382
He thought he could spook Lovecraft.

121
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,483
Get him to reveal himself.

122
00:07:09,517 --> 00:07:10,751
Wow, that's a hell of a plan.

123
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:12,119
How did it work out? Bravo!

124
00:07:12,153 --> 00:07:13,787
We thought she was safe.

125
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:15,455
We thought no one knew she was here.

126
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,824
Yeah, well, you were wrong,
weren't you, you plank?

127
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:20,294
How did they know?

128
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:22,396
Why didn't you tell me
about this foolishness?

129
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,431
Because you would have tried to stop me.

130
00:07:24,465 --> 00:07:25,899
Of course I would tried
to stop you, you putz!

131
00:07:25,934 --> 00:07:27,301
What the hell are you thinking?

132
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:29,503
The Wayne case is closed. It is closed!

133
00:07:29,537 --> 00:07:31,738
You know damn well it's not
closed! Don't tell me what I know!

134
00:07:31,773 --> 00:07:34,074
Will you shut up, the pair of ya!

135
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:36,576
You can argue later!

136
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:40,380
Right now, we need to find Master Bruce.

137
00:07:41,716 --> 00:07:42,816
All right.

138
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,151
If they don't come back soon,

139
00:07:44,185 --> 00:07:45,505
they would have headed to Gotham.

140
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,954
Selina feels safe there.

141
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:48,622
Good luck trying
to find her in the city.

142
00:07:48,656 --> 00:07:49,990
A street kid like that?

143
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:52,426
But you will help us find her, right?

144
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,927
Yeah, of course I will.

145
00:07:53,962 --> 00:07:55,929
Because I have to be crazy.

146
00:07:55,964 --> 00:07:58,165
Thank you. All right,

147
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,933
I'll focus on Lovecraft,
I'll find him, and if he is

148
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:02,102
behind this, I'll get him
to call off the contract.

149
00:08:02,136 --> 00:08:04,104
How you gonna do that? I don't
know, I'll think of something.

150
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:05,839
Run the streets, huh?

151
00:08:05,873 --> 00:08:08,642
Focus on your contacts. Go to work.

152
00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:10,477
I'm coming with you.

153
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:12,779
All right.

154
00:08:12,814 --> 00:08:14,381
You're pretty handy for a valet.

155
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:18,085
Butler, mate.

156
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:21,488
I'm the butler.

157
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:27,661
We need to call Alfred.

158
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:29,062
You see any phones?

159
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:32,900
No.

160
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:34,635
Perhaps we should go back to my house.

161
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,503
If the police are there,
we'll know it's safe.

162
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:38,672
Yeah, right.

163
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:41,186
The police will make it safe?

164
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:46,079
We have to contact the
police at some point.

165
00:08:46,114 --> 00:08:48,081
Someone tried to kill you.

166
00:08:48,116 --> 00:08:50,083
Me?

167
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:52,719
Nobody knew I was there.

168
00:08:52,754 --> 00:08:55,088
It's your house; Someone wants to kill you.

169
00:08:55,123 --> 00:08:58,091
Duh.

170
00:08:58,126 --> 00:09:00,093
Why would anyone want to kill me?

171
00:09:00,128 --> 00:09:03,096
Must be all that lame
detective work you're doing.

172
00:09:03,131 --> 00:09:05,365
Paid off good, huh?

173
00:09:06,868 --> 00:09:08,669
Cheer up.

174
00:09:08,703 --> 00:09:10,504
We're cool.

175
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:11,738
We lost them.

176
00:09:11,773 --> 00:09:14,174
I'm worried about Alfred.

177
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:15,776
Relax.

178
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,378
Once I got you safely hidden in the city,

179
00:09:18,413 --> 00:09:20,781
I'll find you a phone.

180
00:09:20,815 --> 00:09:23,350
Thank you.

181
00:09:23,384 --> 00:09:25,352
I appreciate your help.

182
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:27,354
Hey...

183
00:09:27,388 --> 00:09:29,323
just trying to be nice.

184
00:09:58,382 --> 00:10:00,774
How did Maroni know where my money was?

185
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,409
Wha...

186
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:06,046
Well, that's a very good question.

187
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,483
Not to criticize, but you
could have just called me.

188
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:14,421
I'm going to ask you once more.

189
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:18,492
How did Maroni know where I
kept my money? No one knew.

190
00:10:18,526 --> 00:10:22,062
The robbery at the armory.

191
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:24,064
That wasn't Maroni.

192
00:10:24,098 --> 00:10:25,766
I thought we were friends.

193
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,467
We had an understanding.

194
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:31,438
You tell me every move Maroni makes.

195
00:10:31,472 --> 00:10:33,573
What happened?

196
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:35,342
When did you turn on me?

197
00:10:35,376 --> 00:10:37,511
Never, Don Falcone.

198
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:39,146
I swear, never.

199
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,116
Maroni had nothing to
do with the armory job.

200
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:44,651
I would know.

201
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,153
I would have told you.

202
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,421
Who was it if not Maroni?

203
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:49,656
And how did they know about my money?

204
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:57,998
Thank you, Liza.

205
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,266
Won't be long.

206
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,301
I'll come back.

207
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,906
I asked you a question.

208
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,145
Oh, you have a mole, obviously.

209
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,648
Which is not Maroni's forte, is it?

210
00:11:14,682 --> 00:11:16,616
No, this is someone else.

211
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:17,884
Someone artful.

212
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,020
Someone close to you.

213
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,689
I know who you're going to name.

214
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,684
But your hatred of Fish makes me doubt

215
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:26,126
anything you say against her.

216
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,562
With respect...

217
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:31,965
I don't understand why you
still tolerate her existence.

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,569
She has proved her
disloyalty a hundred times.

219
00:11:35,603 --> 00:11:37,170
She wants your head.

220
00:11:37,205 --> 00:11:40,007
Like half the people who work for me.

221
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,521
Fish makes me a lot of money.

222
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:44,077
I can handle Fish Mooney,

223
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:46,179
or whatever son of a bitch did this to me.

224
00:11:46,214 --> 00:11:49,082
Tell me how to find the mole.

225
00:11:49,117 --> 00:11:52,319
You leave that to me, Don Falcone.

226
00:11:52,353 --> 00:11:53,587
Dirty work.

227
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:55,689
I'll find your mole for you.

228
00:11:55,723 --> 00:11:58,091
Trust me...

229
00:11:58,126 --> 00:11:59,926
he'll belong to Fish.

230
00:12:02,397 --> 00:12:04,298
Bring me proof.

231
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:11,738
I don't get it.

232
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,340
You, Gabe? Not get it?

233
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,443
<i>Quelle suprise.</i>

234
00:12:16,477 --> 00:12:18,912
What, pray, don't you get?

235
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:22,215
Why not just tell Falcone the truth?

236
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,685
It was that Liza girl that betrayed him.

237
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:27,421
Timing, Gabriel.

238
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,356
Timing is everything.

239
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,925
And Liza is a time bomb.

240
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,627
Just...

241
00:12:33,661 --> 00:12:36,096
wait a while.

242
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,498
Then watch and learn.

243
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,936
Stay there in case he shows.

244
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,871
Lovecraft isn't at home.
Housekeeper hasn't seen him

245
00:12:44,906 --> 00:12:46,873
since yesterday. Allen says he didn't

246
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:48,642
come into his office. He
and Montoya are watching it.

247
00:12:48,676 --> 00:12:50,377
How did the killers know
where to find my witness?

248
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:52,379
Let's keep calm here. It's a win.

249
00:12:52,413 --> 00:12:54,314
We've made Lovecraft panic.

250
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:55,983
This is a panic move. A win?!

251
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:57,417
There's two children out there with

252
00:12:57,452 --> 00:12:59,386
professional assassins coming after them.

253
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,954
Bruce and Selina could end up dead.

254
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,589
We're gonna get Lovecraft to call them off.

255
00:13:02,624 --> 00:13:05,158
How did they know?

256
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:07,394
I never told you her name,

257
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:08,996
let alone where she was hiding,

258
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,131
so you couldn't have... I should say not.

259
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,834
And you never mentioned my name

260
00:13:13,868 --> 00:13:15,135
to anyone, right?

261
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,503
No, we agreed.

262
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:17,938
I didn't mention any names out loud.

263
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:20,641
No names "out loud"?

264
00:13:22,477 --> 00:13:23,777
What about whispering?

265
00:13:23,811 --> 00:13:25,312
Don't hold out on me.

266
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,980
I'll know.

267
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,851
For deep background, I leaked your name

268
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:31,919
to a couple of select sources.

269
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:33,153
I had to, for credibility!

270
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,488
You're the Wayne murders cop.

271
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,523
Damn it! That's how they got to her.

272
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:39,626
I'm surprised it took
them this long to find her.

273
00:13:39,661 --> 00:13:41,128
This is on you, Dent! Whoa.

274
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:42,296
I'll stipulate mea culpa.

275
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,964
Kick my ass, be my guest.

276
00:13:43,998 --> 00:13:45,833
But let's find Lovecraft first

277
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,935
and get him to call off the killers.

278
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:50,938
He's not at home, he's not at his office.

279
00:13:50,972 --> 00:13:52,272
He could've left Gotham.

280
00:13:52,307 --> 00:13:53,841
Someone could be hiding him. Lovecraft...

281
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,109
has got a couple of condos

282
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:58,345
that he keeps under his mistress's name.

283
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,215
One up in Stevensburgh and one, uh, uptown.

284
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:03,884
I'll take the one uptown.

285
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:06,587
If anything's happened to these kids...

286
00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:16,463
We know you ran with a girl

287
00:14:16,498 --> 00:14:17,831
called Cat.

288
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:19,233
She's in serious danger.

289
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:20,634
Who isn't, right?

290
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:22,035
Crazy world.

291
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,505
How much?

292
00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:31,111
There's $100.

293
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,883
All right, listen.

294
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,917
I don't know where Cat lives, all right?

295
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,353
She's... private

296
00:14:39,387 --> 00:14:41,488
about stuff like that.

297
00:14:41,523 --> 00:14:43,083
But... I heard that she got a new fence,

298
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,191
'cause her old one got popped.

299
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:45,592
He'd know where to find her.

300
00:14:45,627 --> 00:14:46,860
Who's the fence?

301
00:14:46,895 --> 00:14:48,495
I don't know.

302
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,164
But I know who would know.

303
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:52,433
Oh, yeah? Who's that?!

304
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,371
Damn it, Alfred, save your cheese!

305
00:14:57,405 --> 00:14:58,939
I can beat the truth out of this kid

306
00:14:58,973 --> 00:15:00,240
with a roll of quarters!

307
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,942
Yo, ask Fish Mooney.

308
00:15:01,976 --> 00:15:03,444
She runs

309
00:15:03,478 --> 00:15:04,978
all the fences.

310
00:15:16,157 --> 00:15:17,858
Forgive me for shocking you,

311
00:15:17,892 --> 00:15:21,195
but let me give you some context here.

312
00:15:21,229 --> 00:15:23,230
I loved Bannion.

313
00:15:23,264 --> 00:15:25,365
We came up together.

314
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,103
But he was supposed to guard
the armory, and he didn't.

315
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,872
And maybe, just maybe,

316
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:34,208
he looked the other way.

317
00:15:34,242 --> 00:15:35,976
I don't know.

318
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,580
So what do I do?

319
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:40,881
Let it lie?

320
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:42,116
Boss, we understand...

321
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,383
Whoever else was involved

322
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:46,487
will very soon wish

323
00:15:46,521 --> 00:15:49,590
they could die quickly, like Bannion.

324
00:15:49,624 --> 00:15:51,158
In the meantime,

325
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:55,729
all of us must do what's
right for the family.

326
00:15:55,764 --> 00:15:58,799
Each of your tariffs will increase 25%

327
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,235
until we've built the reserves again.

328
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,637
No disrespect, that's high.

329
00:16:05,974 --> 00:16:07,441
A little bit.

330
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:09,475
What do you think, Fish? Am I being fair?

331
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,080
We're family.

332
00:16:13,114 --> 00:16:15,949
We sink or swim together.

333
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:17,985
You could all learn from Fish.

334
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,920
She trusts me.

335
00:16:19,954 --> 00:16:22,156
Trust me, and I'll trust you.

336
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,158
It goes both ways.

337
00:16:25,994 --> 00:16:27,227
Let's eat.

338
00:16:42,177 --> 00:16:44,011
<i>There's a phone!</i>

339
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,046
Come on!

340
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:50,684
I don't... I don't carry coins.

341
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,286
Do you have any coins?

342
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,520
Nope.

343
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,622
Not a dime.

344
00:16:55,657 --> 00:16:56,990
Why does Alfred matter
so much to you anyway?

345
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:58,025
He's just your butler.

346
00:16:58,026 --> 00:16:59,760
He's my family.

347
00:17:10,105 --> 00:17:12,206
Good luck, kid. See you around maybe.

348
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,374
What?

349
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:14,642
Wait! Look...

350
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:16,877
those bad guys were there for me.

351
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,712
Not you.

352
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,681
You have nothing to worry about.

353
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:21,915
Go home.

354
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,250
But you said...

355
00:17:23,284 --> 00:17:25,204
I was just trying to freak you out.

356
00:17:25,954 --> 00:17:27,087
I was playing with you.

357
00:17:27,122 --> 00:17:29,990
You were playing with me?

358
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:31,659
That's kind of cruel, isn't it?

359
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:32,693
Yeah.

360
00:17:32,694 --> 00:17:33,894
No, look,

361
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,362
you're right about me.

362
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:36,597
I'm not nice.

363
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:38,766
Not like you.

364
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,234
You got a nice way about you.

365
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,670
"A nice way"? Yeah. That's why

366
00:17:42,704 --> 00:17:44,505
I said that thing about
you being the target,

367
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:47,808
so, you know, we could
hang out a while longer.

368
00:17:51,046 --> 00:17:53,580
I see.

369
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,349
It's very convoluted reasoning.

370
00:17:55,383 --> 00:17:57,751
Whatever.

371
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,520
Anyhow, it's been cool.

372
00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:01,622
I'm gonna disappear. But you can't do that!

373
00:18:01,656 --> 00:18:03,223
I wasn't asking. You can't disappear!

374
00:18:03,258 --> 00:18:04,618
You have to come back home with me.

375
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,894
When Detective Gordon finds the man

376
00:18:06,928 --> 00:18:09,063
who killed my parents, you have to testify.

377
00:18:09,097 --> 00:18:12,666
You really think that
was ever going to happen?

378
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:16,136
Grow up, B.

379
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,376
No, don't! You won't make it!

380
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:13,947
Help.

381
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,533
You're crazy.

382
00:19:19,568 --> 00:19:20,801
Please don't run off again.

383
00:19:20,835 --> 00:19:21,969
I'm out of breath.

384
00:19:22,003 --> 00:19:25,105
Okay, kiddo.

385
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,507
You earned it.

386
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,475
You want to hang with me, that's cool,

387
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,977
but my world, my rules.

388
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:31,245
You do what I say.

389
00:19:32,314 --> 00:19:34,181
Yes, ma'am.

390
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:45,670
Why can't I call Alfred

391
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:47,371
or Detective Gordon to
let them know I'm okay?

392
00:19:47,406 --> 00:19:48,639
Because we're disappearing.

393
00:19:48,674 --> 00:19:51,075
You got to be like smoke.

394
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:55,525
Smoke doesn't make phone calls.

395
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:05,556
What is this place? The Flea.

396
00:20:05,591 --> 00:20:07,024
It's like the mall for street kids,

397
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:08,326
without the crappy music.

398
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,840
We'll be safe here till dark.

399
00:20:17,603 --> 00:20:19,503
Falcone's making me nervous.

400
00:20:19,538 --> 00:20:21,839
If he suspects it was
us who blew up his money,

401
00:20:21,874 --> 00:20:23,608
why hasn't he made a move?

402
00:20:23,642 --> 00:20:25,409
'Cause he can't be sure.

403
00:20:25,444 --> 00:20:28,045
There are ten other people
who could have done this.

404
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,081
So what now?

405
00:20:30,115 --> 00:20:32,049
You're going to stick to the plan.

406
00:20:32,084 --> 00:20:34,018
You're gonna reach out
to Saviano and Turski.

407
00:20:34,052 --> 00:20:35,586
They are both very angry

408
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:37,288
that their taxes have been raised,

409
00:20:37,322 --> 00:20:39,957
and they're worried about
ending up like Bannion.

410
00:20:39,992 --> 00:20:42,293
They're ready. The old man

411
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:43,861
is herding his sheep toward me.

412
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:45,563
You got it, boss.

413
00:20:45,597 --> 00:20:48,633
All right.

414
00:20:55,908 --> 00:20:57,875
Hello, gentlemen.

415
00:21:00,078 --> 00:21:02,046
Busy day, Harvey. Come back next year.

416
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,548
Hand to God, Butch,

417
00:21:03,582 --> 00:21:06,250
I'll be quicker than a
sailor on shore leave.

418
00:21:06,285 --> 00:21:07,652
Thief we're tracking down.

419
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:09,287
Look familiar? Goes by "Cat."

420
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:10,421
Nope.

421
00:21:10,455 --> 00:21:11,756
Maybe Fish knows her.

422
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,157
Fish knows everyone.

423
00:21:13,192 --> 00:21:14,292
Fish is busy.

424
00:21:14,326 --> 00:21:15,326
She works with one of

425
00:21:15,327 --> 00:21:16,407
your fences, a new guy.

426
00:21:16,428 --> 00:21:17,962
What's a fence?

427
00:21:17,996 --> 00:21:19,897
Come on, Butch. Be nice.

428
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:21,399
This is important.

429
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:22,433
Where's Fish?

430
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:25,069
I told you, she's busy.

431
00:21:25,103 --> 00:21:26,504
I once knew a fella

432
00:21:26,538 --> 00:21:27,805
called Butch.

433
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,608
Yeah, he was a Whitechapel lad.

434
00:21:30,642 --> 00:21:33,244
Now, we called him Butch,
you see, 'cause he wasn't.

435
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:35,179
It was a wind-up.

436
00:21:35,214 --> 00:21:37,014
It was like a joke name.

437
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:39,089
In fact, he was a horrible little toe rag.

438
00:21:39,117 --> 00:21:40,418
What?

439
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:42,353
I can't tell. Are-are you...
are you threatening me?

440
00:21:42,387 --> 00:21:44,867
Is he threatening me?

441
00:21:45,891 --> 00:21:47,825
Yeah?

442
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,360
You can't...

443
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:50,828
Now...

444
00:21:50,863 --> 00:21:53,498
where is this Fish?

445
00:21:54,466 --> 00:21:55,666
Right here.

446
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,605
So... what's the fuss?

447
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:03,174
They're just fooling around.

448
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,210
We're looking for this girl,

449
00:22:06,245 --> 00:22:09,881
a street thief, goes by Cat,
works with one of your fences.

450
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:12,683
Looks familiar. What's the urgency?

451
00:22:12,718 --> 00:22:14,619
Professional killers are looking for her.

452
00:22:14,653 --> 00:22:16,387
Professionals, huh?

453
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:18,890
This wouldn't be the Lovecraft
witness, now would it?

454
00:22:18,924 --> 00:22:20,558
How'd you know?

455
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:22,126
Streets talk.

456
00:22:22,161 --> 00:22:24,328
Using her to scare Lovecraft.

457
00:22:24,363 --> 00:22:26,130
She saw the Waynes' killer,

458
00:22:26,165 --> 00:22:27,565
supposedly.

459
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,599
Yeah. Mm...

460
00:22:29,902 --> 00:22:32,003
And you're here because you want me

461
00:22:32,037 --> 00:22:34,572
to help you find her, don't you?

462
00:22:34,606 --> 00:22:35,873
Yes.

463
00:22:35,908 --> 00:22:37,408
Harvey...

464
00:22:38,944 --> 00:22:41,045
Why in the world

465
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,980
would I help you find her,

466
00:22:43,015 --> 00:22:44,816
of all people?

467
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,852
She has Bruce Wayne with her, miss.

468
00:22:47,886 --> 00:22:49,554
Really?

469
00:22:49,588 --> 00:22:51,823
Yes, miss.

470
00:22:51,857 --> 00:22:55,093
I'm Alfred Pennyworth. I'm
the boy's legal guardian.

471
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:57,495
Very pleased to meet you. Likewise.

472
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:58,896
Miss Mooney, we need your help.

473
00:22:58,931 --> 00:22:59,931
Well, you see, Alfred,

474
00:22:59,965 --> 00:23:01,599
I would love to help you,

475
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:04,235
but it would infringe
upon my personal interests.

476
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:06,237
And why would I do that?

477
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:10,775
You have a very eloquent... gaze,

478
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:12,510
if I may say so, Miss Mooney.

479
00:23:12,544 --> 00:23:16,447
And I can see that you're
not a woman that would

480
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:21,619
let petty self-interest outweigh... honor.

481
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:23,821
And compassion.

482
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:30,428
I'll make some calls.

483
00:23:32,097 --> 00:23:34,665
But remember this kindness.

484
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:44,308
Much better.

485
00:23:44,343 --> 00:23:47,045
Really?

486
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,546
I'm not sure.

487
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,981
You look badass.

488
00:23:50,015 --> 00:23:51,616
No lie.

489
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,152
Hey, Cat.

490
00:23:54,186 --> 00:23:55,887
Ivy...

491
00:23:55,921 --> 00:23:57,588
what are you doing here?

492
00:23:57,623 --> 00:23:59,791
What have you been up to? I thought...

493
00:23:59,825 --> 00:24:01,626
Yeah, Juvie caught me.

494
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,960
I got adopted upstate.

495
00:24:02,995 --> 00:24:03,995
Didn't take?

496
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:05,430
Good people... they wanted me

497
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:07,465
to cut my hair, dress nice.

498
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:09,233
I know you.

499
00:24:09,268 --> 00:24:11,402
You're Mario Pepper's daughter.

500
00:24:11,437 --> 00:24:13,204
Yes. Who are you?

501
00:24:14,707 --> 00:24:15,940
I'm Bruce Wayne.

502
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:18,910
Yes, you are.

503
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,278
Billionaire Bruce Wayne.

504
00:24:20,312 --> 00:24:22,280
Stay cool now, Ivy.

505
00:24:22,314 --> 00:24:24,282
I am cool. Why are you telling me that?

506
00:24:24,316 --> 00:24:25,416
Why are you telling me what to do?

507
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:27,085
I'm not. I'm just saying,

508
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:28,786
I don't want you to get mad at him.

509
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:30,188
He's a friend.

510
00:24:30,222 --> 00:24:31,302
Why would I get mad at him?

511
00:24:31,323 --> 00:24:32,323
It's not his fault, is it?

512
00:24:32,358 --> 00:24:34,525
Did you kill my father?

513
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,094
Do you make my mother cut her wrists?

514
00:24:36,128 --> 00:24:37,595
No.

515
00:24:37,629 --> 00:24:39,697
Somebody did... somebody did,

516
00:24:39,732 --> 00:24:40,999
but not him.

517
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:43,001
How you doing? You doing okay?

518
00:24:43,035 --> 00:24:45,703
I'm okay. And you?

519
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:47,939
I'm doing great. How do I look?

520
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:51,175
You look good.

521
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,343
Have you seen Clyde the fence around?

522
00:24:52,378 --> 00:24:53,645
Yeah, he's working

523
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,813
out of the Factory on the Narrows.

524
00:24:55,848 --> 00:24:56,948
He's cute, isn't he?

525
00:24:56,982 --> 00:24:58,883
Yes, he is. Uh, thanks, Ivy.

526
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:01,786
Good to see you. Uh, we
got to go run and see Clyde.

527
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,689
Oh. Okay, fine. Bye, then.

528
00:25:04,723 --> 00:25:06,391
Keep moving.

529
00:25:06,425 --> 00:25:08,359
She's just a little girl.

530
00:25:08,394 --> 00:25:09,961
Why are you so scared of her?

531
00:25:09,995 --> 00:25:12,475
Because she's scary. Don't look back.

532
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:40,425
GCPD!

533
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:42,093
Drop it.

534
00:25:44,229 --> 00:25:46,097
Kick it over.

535
00:25:51,103 --> 00:25:54,272
You're under arrest.
Conspiracy to commit murder.

536
00:25:54,306 --> 00:25:55,940
Murder? Me, murder?

537
00:25:55,975 --> 00:25:58,009
Look, what are you talking about?

538
00:25:58,043 --> 00:26:00,044
You put a hit out on Selina Kyle.

539
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,713
No, not me.

540
00:26:01,747 --> 00:26:04,215
The same people that came
after her came after me, too.

541
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,384
Th-They attacked me on the street.

542
00:26:06,418 --> 00:26:07,719
Why do you think I'm hiding in here?

543
00:26:07,753 --> 00:26:09,120
Why would they come after you?

544
00:26:09,154 --> 00:26:10,154
Why do they ever come?

545
00:26:10,155 --> 00:26:11,589
Because I know too much.

546
00:26:11,624 --> 00:26:14,459
Cut the crap. Who are you so scared of?

547
00:26:14,493 --> 00:26:16,027
You have no idea, do you?

548
00:26:16,061 --> 00:26:17,595
You think I'm the big wheel.

549
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,197
When it comes to the crunch, kid,

550
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:22,300
I'm nobody, just like you.

551
00:26:22,334 --> 00:26:24,102
A-And the people

552
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:26,070
who really, truly run this city,

553
00:26:26,105 --> 00:26:27,972
they're watching you huff and
puff and run around crusading,

554
00:26:28,007 --> 00:26:29,474
and they are laughing at you.

555
00:26:29,508 --> 00:26:30,808
You're so deep in the maze,

556
00:26:30,843 --> 00:26:32,577
you can't see over the wall.

557
00:26:32,611 --> 00:26:34,445
Tell me something I don't know.

558
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,981
My briefcase, under the bed. Files.

559
00:26:37,016 --> 00:26:39,117
Go.

560
00:26:39,151 --> 00:26:42,954
Right before the Waynes got killed,

561
00:26:42,988 --> 00:26:45,490
there was a run on Wayne Enterprises stock.

562
00:26:45,524 --> 00:26:47,792
Like somebody knew something
bad was gonna happen.

563
00:26:47,826 --> 00:26:49,994
So I figured I deserved a cut.

564
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:51,896
So I started digging.

565
00:27:07,346 --> 00:27:09,614
I've come for that man.

566
00:27:09,648 --> 00:27:12,016
You need not get hurt.

567
00:27:52,324 --> 00:27:56,227
Mm... that was nice.

568
00:27:56,262 --> 00:27:58,663
Let's do it again sometime.

569
00:28:18,685 --> 00:28:20,753
Yeah?

570
00:28:20,788 --> 00:28:22,522
Fish got a lead on the kids,

571
00:28:22,556 --> 00:28:24,757
at a place on the Narrows
called The Factory.

572
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:26,826
Word is, Cat used a fence named Clyde.

573
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,095
He hangs there. We're on our way now.

574
00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:31,864
Alfred, let's go.

575
00:28:31,899 --> 00:28:33,800
Fish, thank you.

576
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:35,435
You owe me.

577
00:28:35,469 --> 00:28:38,004
Who don't I owe?

578
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,574
Mr. Lovecraft?

579
00:29:03,097 --> 00:29:05,064
No, no, no, no, no.

580
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:06,799
This is Detective Gordon.

581
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:09,602
Badge number 23-16-11.

582
00:29:09,637 --> 00:29:12,739
Reporting body at 1257 Antioch.

583
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:26,619
Cat! My baby!

584
00:29:26,654 --> 00:29:29,355
Hey, Clyde. Well...

585
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,823
what have you got for me?

586
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,161
Hey! Shh!

587
00:29:35,195 --> 00:29:37,297
Wow.

588
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:39,499
Sweet swag.

589
00:29:39,533 --> 00:29:41,034
Not your usual junk.

590
00:29:41,068 --> 00:29:42,735
Moving on up.

591
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:47,373
Where'd you get this?

592
00:29:47,408 --> 00:29:48,975
You want a story or the swag?

593
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:50,543
How much?

594
00:29:50,577 --> 00:29:51,778
Thousand bucks.

595
00:29:53,714 --> 00:29:56,683
Please. Give me a break.

596
00:29:56,717 --> 00:29:58,637
That's rock-bottom, you know it is.

597
00:30:00,487 --> 00:30:01,788
Fifty bucks.

598
00:30:01,822 --> 00:30:02,822
Fifty?

599
00:30:02,823 --> 00:30:04,557
This pen is real gold,

600
00:30:04,591 --> 00:30:05,992
and that's an antique jade netsuke.

601
00:30:06,026 --> 00:30:08,328
It's worth $2,000 on its own.

602
00:30:08,362 --> 00:30:12,999
And who is this
well-spoken little... dude?

603
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:14,300
Never mind who he is.

604
00:30:14,335 --> 00:30:17,337
Look, 500 is rock-bottom.

605
00:30:17,371 --> 00:30:19,038
Why are you wasting my time?

606
00:30:19,073 --> 00:30:21,908
Relax.

607
00:30:21,942 --> 00:30:25,111
I'm sure we can... make a deal.

608
00:30:28,182 --> 00:30:30,817
No, thanks. We'll go elsewhere.

609
00:30:30,851 --> 00:30:34,220
Cool down, Cat.

610
00:30:35,956 --> 00:30:38,992
Or we'll poke your
little friend's eyes out.

611
00:30:39,026 --> 00:30:40,760
That's it.

612
00:30:40,794 --> 00:30:43,496
Relax.

613
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:47,166
I've got some friends coming over

614
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:50,603
who would just love to meet you.

615
00:32:04,945 --> 00:32:06,346
It's all there.

616
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,014
Don't look so anxious.

617
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:11,351
Yeah, well, um... you
guys are kind of sporty.

618
00:32:11,385 --> 00:32:12,418
Where is she?

619
00:32:12,453 --> 00:32:14,821
She's upstairs.

620
00:32:14,855 --> 00:32:16,222
She better be.

621
00:32:27,535 --> 00:32:29,369
Find me something heavy.

622
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:52,528
Am I the only one in this damn
town who waits for backup?!

623
00:34:14,117 --> 00:34:15,718
Bruce!

624
00:34:19,356 --> 00:34:21,056
Follow!

625
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:36,172
Where's Alfred?

626
00:34:36,206 --> 00:34:37,506
He's in there.

627
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:39,308
Go!

628
00:35:07,204 --> 00:35:08,604
Down!

629
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,795
Where's your girlfriend?

630
00:35:37,701 --> 00:35:39,101
I have no idea.

631
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,736
Don't make me hurt you.

632
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,405
You're not on the contract.

633
00:35:44,908 --> 00:35:47,410
She's gone.

634
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,017
Some advice, kid:

635
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:58,254
Don't ever mistake bravery for good sense.

636
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:11,300
Alfred.

637
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:16,572
Fancy seeing you here.

638
00:36:16,606 --> 00:36:18,474
You all right?

639
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:20,543
I'm fine.

640
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:22,578
How are you?

641
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,488
You really scared me, Master Bruce.

642
00:36:33,957 --> 00:36:36,926
If you die...

643
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,995
who employs butlers anymore?

644
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,548
Oh, thank God.

645
00:37:08,528 --> 00:37:13,031
Lovecraft was a beloved
pillar of this community.

646
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:15,501
A dedicated servant of Gotham.

647
00:37:15,535 --> 00:37:18,237
So, what do I tell the media, huh?

648
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:19,738
Hmm?!

649
00:37:19,772 --> 00:37:21,240
Any ideas?

650
00:37:21,274 --> 00:37:22,875
He was a crook.

651
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,676
We nearly had him.

652
00:37:24,711 --> 00:37:26,712
And he was killed by whoever
he would have implicated

653
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:28,514
if he had lived to testify.

654
00:37:28,548 --> 00:37:30,182
Say that.

655
00:37:30,216 --> 00:37:33,352
Forgive me if I can't
get behind your approach.

656
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:34,453
It was your gun.

657
00:37:34,487 --> 00:37:36,054
I didn't kill him.

658
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:38,089
On balance, I believe you... on balance.

659
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:41,126
But suicide is much cleaner...

660
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:42,594
It wasn't suicide, it was murder!

661
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:43,929
It was suicide!

662
00:37:43,963 --> 00:37:45,464
He went mad

663
00:37:45,498 --> 00:37:46,598
under your relentless questioning,

664
00:37:46,633 --> 00:37:48,133
overpowered you

665
00:37:48,168 --> 00:37:50,369
and killed himself with your gun.

666
00:37:50,403 --> 00:37:52,571
And don't tell me otherwise.

667
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:57,843
What do you say, counselor?

668
00:38:02,582 --> 00:38:04,550
I'm at your disposal, Mayor James.

669
00:38:04,584 --> 00:38:07,152
I'm sorry if we've caused you any disquiet.

670
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:09,822
"Disquiet."

671
00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:12,057
You arrogant clowns.

672
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:16,962
You're hacking away at the
very foundations of this city.

673
00:38:16,996 --> 00:38:19,631
Trying to take me down!

674
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:21,667
Should have the both
of you stuffed in a sack

675
00:38:21,701 --> 00:38:23,335
and thrown in the river.

676
00:38:25,338 --> 00:38:28,073
But I can't do that.

677
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:30,409
Two scapegoats would look like panic.

678
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:32,778
But one of you is going
down, mark my words.

679
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:34,146
Sir, that's not right.

680
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,348
Hush.

681
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:38,117
It's not you, Dent.

682
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:41,787
Obviously, it's Mr. Gordon.

683
00:38:41,821 --> 00:38:43,021
Sir, I protest.

684
00:38:43,056 --> 00:38:44,423
But not too much.

685
00:38:44,457 --> 00:38:46,937
You see, Counselor Dent

686
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,995
knows how to walk the line.

687
00:38:51,865 --> 00:38:53,332
He knows where the edge is.

688
00:38:55,235 --> 00:38:56,869
You, Mr. Gordon,

689
00:38:56,903 --> 00:38:59,638
do not know where the edge is.

690
00:39:06,646 --> 00:39:08,380
Mayor James.

691
00:39:11,251 --> 00:39:13,585
Kiss my ass.

692
00:39:20,427 --> 00:39:25,397
Dick Lovecraft's suicide is
a terrible, terrible tragedy.

693
00:39:25,432 --> 00:39:27,866
Fighting the trumped-up charges

694
00:39:27,901 --> 00:39:31,570
of an overzealous police
officer was too much for him.

695
00:39:33,173 --> 00:39:36,308
You have my word, Dick.

696
00:39:36,342 --> 00:39:38,343
This officer is being dealt with.

697
00:39:40,213 --> 00:39:42,247
Arkham Asylum?

698
00:39:42,282 --> 00:39:44,316
A security guard for nut-jobs?

699
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,018
Criminal nut-jobs, yeah.

700
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:48,020
Are you taking the assignment?

701
00:39:48,054 --> 00:39:49,521
It's that or quit.

702
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:50,656
So quit.

703
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,391
That's what they want me to do.

704
00:39:52,425 --> 00:39:55,694
Damn, Jim.

705
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:57,229
Whoever your next partner is,

706
00:39:57,263 --> 00:39:59,698
he or she will be a lot easier than me.

707
00:40:01,234 --> 00:40:03,035
Ed.

708
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:05,738
Detective Gordon, I hear you've
been thrown out in disgrace.

709
00:40:05,772 --> 00:40:06,772
Is this true?

710
00:40:06,773 --> 00:40:08,006
Yeah, it is.

711
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:10,376
I'm gonna write a letter to the boss.

712
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,077
You do that.

713
00:40:12,112 --> 00:40:13,912
Which boss should I write to?

714
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:16,882
Forget it, Ed.

715
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,884
That's the breaks, huh?

716
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:19,918
You take care.

717
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:28,894
Maybe you should take him with you.

718
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,629
You'd miss him if he was gone.

719
00:40:30,664 --> 00:40:32,898
No, I wouldn't.

720
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:34,767
Let me buy you a drink sometime.

721
00:40:37,804 --> 00:40:39,138
Soon.

722
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:02,261
Your security still sucks.

723
00:41:05,031 --> 00:41:07,132
No one's hunting for me.

724
00:41:09,169 --> 00:41:12,137
I didn't expect to see you again.

725
00:41:12,172 --> 00:41:14,673
Never said good-bye.

726
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:17,076
No, we didn't.

727
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,445
Didn't want to be rude.

728
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:23,115
It-it's good to see you.

729
00:41:23,149 --> 00:41:24,883
Here.

730
00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:44,837
Thank you, but you could keep this.

731
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:46,372
You need it more than I do.

732
00:41:46,406 --> 00:41:50,175
Nah, let's keep things honest between us.

733
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,678
I'm keeping this one anyway.

734
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:12,231
Having a little chat, Master Bruce?

735
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:16,335
Thinking out loud.

736
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:18,170
Right.

737
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:19,405
Right.

738
00:42:19,439 --> 00:42:21,674
Of course you were.

739
00:42:28,214 --> 00:42:30,716
Shall I take that for you?

740
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:41,327
The old house seems very quiet...

741
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:42,828
without her, doesn't it?

742
00:42:42,862 --> 00:42:45,264
Yes, it does.
