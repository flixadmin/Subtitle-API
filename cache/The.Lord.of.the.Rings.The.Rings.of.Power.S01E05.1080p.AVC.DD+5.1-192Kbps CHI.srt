Durin was right.

528
00:34:46,616 --> 00:34:48,950

I promised Durin never
to reveal his people's secrets.

532
00:34:57,991 --> 00:35:00,866
And what if keeping
your promise to his people

533
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:04,450
meant ensuring the doom of your own?

534
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:42,825
We first took notice of it
just prior to Galadriel's return.

535
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:44,700
We hoped that by sending her away,

536
00:35:44,783 --> 00:35:48,491
and so bringing an end
to the last vestiges of war,

537
00:35:48,575 --> 00:35:50,783
we might arrest the decay.

538
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:54,700
But despite our every effort,

539
00:35:54,783 --> 00:35:57,700
our decline has only quickened.

540
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:01,908
The blight upon this tree
is but an outer manifestation

541
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:03,533
of an inner reality.

542
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:06,533
That the light of the Eldar,

543
00:36:06,616 --> 00:36:10,033
our light, is fading.

544

Precious few.

546
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:22,700
I ask again, and for the last time,

547
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,700
did the Dwarves find the ore or not?

548
00:36:32,283 --> 00:36:35,450
I swore an oath to Durin.

549
00:36:38,116 --> 00:36:42,116
To some, that may now hold little weight.

550
00:36:45,491 --> 00:36:47,075
But in my esteem,

551
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,658
it is by such things
our very souls are bound.

552
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:56,783
I do not intend to let mine slip away
on the basis of mere hope.

553
00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:02,450
Hope is never mere, Elrond...

554
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,450
even when it is meager.

555
00:37:06,616 --> 00:37:08,991
When all other senses sleep,

556
00:37:09,075 --> 00:37:13,366
the eye of hope is first to awaken,
last to shut.

557
00:37:15,491 --> 00:37:18,950
If the Elves abandon Middle-earth now,

558
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:24,408
the armies of darkness will march
over the face of the earth.

559
00:37:24,491 --> 00:37:25,741
It will be the end,

560

not just of our people, but all peoples.

561
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:34,533
If the hope of preventing
that is not reason enough
