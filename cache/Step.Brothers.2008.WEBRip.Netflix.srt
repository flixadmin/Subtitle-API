1
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,782
Hey, Brennan.

2
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,120
Mom, I'm watching the thing
with the lady.

3
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,205
I'm leaving. Okay?
I'll be home around 11.

4
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,958
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, Brennan.

5
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:27,379
Let's slowly get those hips up.
Good. Now, hold it right here. Great.

6
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,052
Dale.

7
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,221
Dale, I'm leaving for the conference.

8
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,808
-You leave me money for pizza, Dad?
-Yeah, there's $20 on the hall table.

9
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,227
Do not order pay-per-view, buddy.

10
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,063
-But what if I want wings?
-You don't need wings.

11
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,565
That's not enough, Dad!

12
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,358
The RTI cochlear implant...

13
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,069
...is the state-of-the-art
implantable hearing device...

14
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:55,490
...due to its input processing of sound
via the speech processor.

15
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,410
But the most exciting
new development...

16
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,078
...is the external processor...

17
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,497
...which fits directly over the ear...

18
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:06,793
...which eliminates the need to put
your face between those breasts.

19
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:13,925
I'm sorry. I'm just-- I'm so lost.
And this never happens to me.

20
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,514
My name is Robert, and I play
racquetball. I collect coins.

21
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,433
Sweet Jesus! I love Korean food.

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,436
I am Nancy Huff. I know
how to make tandoori chicken...

23
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,688
...I contribute to NPR
every single year...

24
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,857
...and I love the movies
of Rob Reiner.

25
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,109
Pilates changed my life.

26
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,446
I have a boat, and I wanna retire
and sail around the world.

27
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,240
-I love the sea!
-And I drive a Mercedes...

28
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,285
...and I have a 40-year-old son, Dale,
who still lives at home.

29
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,622
-What did you just say?
-I knew I shouldn't have told you that.

30
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,666
I have a 39-year-old son
named Brennan...

31
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,418
...who still lives at home with me.

32
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,972
I would like to thank all of you...

33
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,352
...for being here with us
on this fantastic, wonderful day.

34
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,689
And I would like to raise my glass.

35
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,818
Dale and I wanna welcome you
to our home with open arms.

36
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,656
-Get a room, Dad.
-Oh, for chri-- Dale!

37
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,327
Well, as you all know, my youngest
son, Derek, couldn't be here...

38
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,830
...because of an important
fishing trip.

39
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:30,335
But my other son, Brennan, was going
to be moving into his own place...

40
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:33,588
...but he was recently let go
from his job at PetSmart...

41
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,551
...so he is gonna be living with us.

42
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,887
I wasn't fired from my job,
I was laid off!

43
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,181
But you wouldn't
know the difference.

44
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:47,894
I didn't want salmon!
I said it four times.

45
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,024
This wedding is horseshit.

46
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,365
Somebody's awfully quiet
back there.

47
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,535
I'm not gonna call him Dad.

48
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,871
Brennan, you're 39 years old.

49
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,039
I would not expect you
to call him Dad.

50
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:12,878
Well, I'm not going to, ever.
Even if there's a fire.

51
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,548
Robert better not get in my face...

52
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,384
...because I'll drop
that motherfucker.

53
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:20,886
Jesus, Brennan.

54
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:25,265
I'm just saying, I think
you gotta think about your options.

55
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,310
I know that you are
technically married now...

56
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:32,147
...but that does not mean
that they have to live here.

57
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:37,527
Dale, I think it's time for a change
for both of us.

58
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,406
Dad, we're men, okay?

59
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,075
That means a few things.

60
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,913
We like to shit with the door open.
We talk about pussy.

61
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,458
We go on riverboat-gambling trips.
We make our own beef jerky.

62
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,920
That's what we do.
And now that is all wrecked.

63
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,757
We literally have never done
any of those things.

64
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,134
Where did he go to medical school?

65
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,845
He went to Northwestern
and Johns Hopkins.

66
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,432
-Is that good enough for you?
-No, it's not.

67
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,436
Well, Brennan, those are
very prestigious schools.

68
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,356
I smoked pot with Johnny Hopkins.

69
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,108
You don't know anyone
named Johnny Hopkins.

70
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,237
It was Johnny Hopkins
and Sloan Kettering...

71
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,240
...and they were
blazing that shit up every day.

72
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,785
All right, here's a scenario
for you, Dad.

73
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,287
Suppose Nancy sees me
coming out of the shower...

74
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,374
...and decides to come on to me.
I'm looking good.

75
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,751
I've got a luscious V of hair...

76
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,296
...going from my chest pubes
down to my ball-fro.

77
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,216
And she takes one look at me,
and she goes:

78
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,801
"Oh, my God.

79
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:47,138
I've had the old bull,
now I want the young calf."

80
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,892
-And she grabs me by the wiener.
-Shut the fuck up!

81
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,824
-Come on, Brennan.
-I'm fine here.

82
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,662
-There you are.
-Hi.

83
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,665
Oh, you look so cute
in your moving clothes.

84
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,500
-How was it?
-It was easy.

85
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,502
The movers did everything.

86
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,007
Where's Brennan?

87
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,384
He's still in the car.

88
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,053
It was kind of a rough drive.

89
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,347
Hey, Robert,
what's all the commotion?

90
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,225
-Hey, Don.
-Is that your wife, Nancy?

91
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,811
-Right here, Don.
-Can I come over this afternoon...

92
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,855
-...and touch your face?
-Sure.

93
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,189
Thanks. Good luck, guys.

94
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,482
We'll see you, Don.

95
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,444
Let's go, Cinnamon.
Heel, Cinnamon.

96
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,363
Heel! Cinnamon!

97
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,533
Cinnamon!

98
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,285
Hi, Dale.

99
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,204
Hey, Nancy. Could you make me
a grilled-cheese sandwich?

100
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,873
-Sure.
-No.

101
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,209
Dale just ate. He's testing you to see
how much he can get away with.

102
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,128
-I see.
-I'm hungry.

103
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,880
Look in your right hand.

104
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,382
-I sure don't mind a bit. I really don't.
-No, no.

105
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,718
No, no. He's fine.

106
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,035
Hey.

107
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:33,828
Hey.

108
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,580
I'm Brennan.

109
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,457
I'm Dale.

110
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,918
But you have to call me Dragon.

111
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,630
You have to call me Nighthawk.

112
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:04,985
Brennan.

113
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,488
Please don't do that.

114
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,374
Now, that's enough ketchup.
Come on. Dale.

115
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,627
-I like it.
-That's enough.

116
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,672
So, what have you been
working on recently, Dale?

117
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,173
Well...

118
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,135
...I manage a baseball team.

119
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:34,305
-Little League?
-Fantasy league.

120
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,524
Take a picture. It'll last longer.

121
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,652
Why don't you stop
being so confrontational, Dale?

122
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,487
I'm not the one staring at me.

123
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,698
So, Brennan, how about you?

124
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:55,744
I know you used to
work at PetSmart.

125
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,164
-That's right, Mr. Doback.
-Call me Robert.

126
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,709
-That's right, Robin.
-Robert.

127
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,335
Robin.

128
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:09,799
Actually, Brennan
is a really talented person.

129
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,093
He's a very gifted singer.

130
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,263
-I'm really, really good.
-How good?

131
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,851
I've been called
the songbird of my generation...

132
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,145
...by people who've heard me.

133
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,354
That good.

134
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,940
The only trick is
is that Brennan's very...

135
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:31,362
...particular about
who he sings in front of, so....

136
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,075
I'm his mom, for example,
I've only heard him sing twice.

137
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,786
That's funny that you say that,
because I can sing too.

138
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,662
In fact, I'll sing right now.

139
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,957
If you wanna get down
On these hairy balls

140
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,460
-Hey!
-Why don't you jump right in?

141
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,462
It's a crotch party right up in here

142
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,839
-Stop it!
-Why don't you lick on this big joint?

143
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,759
Stop it, Dale! Stop it! Stop it!

144
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,052
That's cute.

145
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,221
I remember when I had my first beer.

146
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,723
That's so funny,
the last time I heard that...

147
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,892
...I laughed so hard
I fell off my dinosaur.

148
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,895
Stop right now. All right?
Let's just back off.

149
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,565
All right. Brennan, it's okay.
It's okay.

150
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,442
Hey, hey.

151
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,528
-Great, Dale.
-He said a mean thing first.

152
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,405
All right, just--
Look, you know what--? Hey, guys.

153
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,617
Okay, sleeping arrangements.
It's gonna be different...

154
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,412
...but because Dale refuses
to give up his office drum set...

155
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,959
...that means that, Brennan, you and
Dale are gonna have to share a room.

156
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,087
-But it's just temporary.
-Mom, we didn't talk about this.

157
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:32,757
Well, it's gonna be
an exciting adventure.

158
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:36,761
You wanna show him the room, Dale?
Show him where he can put his stuff?

159
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,432
-That's nice, thank you.
-Good night, Nancy.

160
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,354
Hey, listen, I like to have
a lot of fresh fruit around...

161
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,399
...and chocolate chips
in my pancakes. Okay?

162
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,818
-Write it so you don't forget.
-Show him the room.

163
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,612
She's Mom now, so....

164
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,781
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night, Brennan.

165
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:01,578
-Good night, Mr. Doback.
-Good night, Brennan.

166
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,714
So just a few basic rules
about the house.

167
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,799
If there's any foods that you like...

168
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:18,469
...I suggest you put your name
on them, or they will be thrown out.

169
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,180
By me.

170
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,017
House was built in 1825
by General Custer.

171
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,394
I wanna show you this room.

172
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,646
Hold up.

173
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,357
-You see this room?
-Yeah.

174
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,401
Okay, here's the deal.

175
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,739
This is my office
and my beat laboratory.

176
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,407
Okay?

177
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,659
And this is the one rule of the house:

178
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:45,413
Don't ever, ever, ever...

179
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,124
...touch my drum set.

180
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,168
-You understand?
-Don't go in there and--

181
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,420
-No touching!
-All right!

182
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,881
There. I was at about six there.

183
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,008
You don't wanna see me go to 10.

184
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,636
Get your shit.
We're going to my room.

185
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:08,895
Honey?

186
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,524
I just found a chain of islands
that we can sail to after New Zealand.

187
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,109
That's wonderful.

188
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,864
You know,
I've been meaning to ask you....

189
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:28,331
Why is it that Dale never left?

190
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,294
Well, Dale has always
coasted off my accomplishments.

191
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,505
I mean, he left college
his junior year...

192
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,299
...because he said he wanted
to join the family business.

193
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:42,553
-But you're a medical doctor.
-Believe me, I've told him that.

194
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,932
But he just always says,
"It's all about who you know."

195
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,559
I don't know where
he got this sense of entitlement.

196
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,896
Maybe it was his mother passing.
What about Brennan?

197
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,564
From what you've told me...

198
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,150
...his younger brother Derek's
been quite successful.

199
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,737
Well, certainly when his father
and I split, that was difficult for him.

200
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:05,410
And this one time, when Brennan
was 17 and Derek was 14...

201
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,496
...and Brennan decided
to enter a talent show.

202
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,501
He sang a song
from an old pirate musical.

203
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:18,589
But Derek got his football buddies
to replace the choir and sing:

204
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,633
"Brennan has a mangina."

205
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,262
Brennan has a mangina
Brennan has a mangina

206
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:30,977
Finally, the audience and even some
of the nastier parents started singing:

207
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,811
"Brennan has a mangina."

208
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:37,275
And I have to admit, for a little while,
I sort of joined in as well.

209
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:41,571
From that day on,
Brennan never sang again.

210
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:45,658
Derek went on to win the contest
by lip-synching "Ice Ice Baby."

211
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,041
-Oh, that's a great song.
-It is.

212
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:59,881
-Hey, you awake?
-Yeah.

213
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:07,805
I just want you to know I hate you.
So does my dad.

214
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,184
Well, that's fine.

215
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,187
Because guess what.

216
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,522
I hate you too.

217
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,068
And this house sucks ass.

218
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,320
Well, the only reason
you're living here...

219
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:26,115
...is because me and my dad decided
that your mom was really hot...

220
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,868
...and maybe we should just
both bang her.

221
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,329
And we'll put up with the retard
in the meantime.

222
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,290
-Who's the retard?
-You.

223
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,210
-Hey, y'all don't say that.
-Shut up.

224
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,504
You'll wake up my dad
and get me grounded.

225
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,547
Just shut up.

226
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,634
You and your mom are hillbillies.

227
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:49,680
-This is a house of learned doctors.
-You're not a doctor.

228
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,600
You're a big, fat, curly-headed fuck.

229
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,020
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

230
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,189
-I'm a curly-headed fuck?
-Yeah.

231
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,982
You better not go to sleep.

232
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,861
As soon as your eyes shut, I'm gonna
punch you square in the face.

233
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,364
I hope you stay still
when you sleep...

234
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,617
...because I'm putting a rat trap
between your legs.

235
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:14,038
I'm gonna take a pillowcase
and fill it full of bars of soap...

236
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,706
...and beat the shit out of you.

237
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,046
I want you out of my fucking house.

238
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:25,258
No way, kemosabe.

239
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,010
This is my house now.

240
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,723
How do you like The Gilded Lady?

241
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,934
I wish we could retire right now.

242
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,061
Won't be long.

243
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,907
Oh, God! It's cold!

244
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,786
Hey! Is anyone listening? Help!

245
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,668
Fuck you, Dale! Fuck you!

246
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,629
--obviously you guys are hot.
You know?

247
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,798
Just revealed her cover.
I was like, "Wow, this is hot."

248
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,968
A little girl-on-girl.
A little heaven, a little hell.

249
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,224
-Hey.
-Hey.

250
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,604
-Why you so sweaty?
-I was watching Cops.

251
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,148
Not supposed to have
your feet on the couch.

252
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,840
Hey, man.

253
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,842
Did you touch my drum set?

254
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,222
-Nope.
-It's just weird...

255
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,851
...because seems like someone
definitely touched my drum set.

256
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,063
Yeah, that is weird.
Because I didn't touch them.

257
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,775
-Hey! Did you touch my drum set?
-Hey, knock it off!

258
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:51,737
I know you touched my drumstick,
because the left one has a chip in it.

259
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,407
You fucking crazy, man?

260
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:58,494
You sound insane, do you realize
that? You should be medicated.

261
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,122
Fuck you, Brennan.
I know you touched my drum set.

262
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,040
I wanna hear that
dirty mouth admit it.

263
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,085
You get out of my face,
or I'm gonna roundhouse your ass.

264
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,754
You swear on your mom's life
that you didn't touch it!

265
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,964
I don't swear to shit!

266
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,383
That's because you fucking
touched my drum set...

267
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,594
...because I know
Cops doesn't start till 4.

268
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,808
-Where are you going?
-I'm going upstairs.

269
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:24,729
Because I'm gonna put my nut sack
on your drum set. Okay?

270
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,107
Don't you do that.
I am warning you right now:

271
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:32,903
If you touch my drums, I will
stab you in the neck with a knife!

272
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:37,408
If you even go in the room,
I will go ape-shit, you hear me?

273
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,243
Don't wanna miss a spot.

274
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,621
John Bonham's playing
"Moby Dick" for real!

275
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,332
I swear to God. I swear to God! No!

276
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:54,925
I warned you.

277
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,429
There's one rule in the house,
and you broke it!

278
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,191
I didn't touch your damn drum set!

279
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,279
I'm pre-diabetic!

280
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:24,163
You fucking fucker! I'm gonna
rub my balls on your mom's face!

281
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,291
Come back here!

282
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,758
I'll kill you! You son of a bitch!

283
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,302
Your drum set's a whore!

284
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,638
I teabagged your fucking drum set!

285
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:44,350
Well, my drum set's a guy,
so that makes you gay, you fucker!

286
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,977
I'll kill you!

287
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,397
-The story has a....
-Excuse me.

288
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,982
Dr. Doback, the phone's for you.
I think it's urgent.

289
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,192
Hello?

290
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,695
Robert, they're like animals!
I can't stop them!

291
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,322
Stop screaming. Please.
I'm on my way.

292
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,658
There seems to be some
savage fight going on...

293
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,035
...between my son and stepson,
so I--

294
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,748
Rape! Rape! Rape!

295
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:12,795
What's going on?

296
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,214
Robert! They won't-- They won't--

297
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,383
-Stop it! Stop it!
-Dale, what--?

298
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,510
-Stay out of it, Dad!
-Stop it!

299
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,521
What the fucking fuck?

300
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,736
Someone got some air. Snap.

301
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,113
-I still hate you.
-Still hate you.

302
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,365
Such power. It's raw power.

303
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,325
What are you doing?
It's Shark Week.

304
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,618
Okay, here's the deal:

305
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:48,497
Number one, you will fix
the fucking drywall now.

306
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,001
Number two, you have one month to
find jobs or you're out on your asses.

307
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,879
I will arrange interviews for Monday,
and you will go!

308
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,841
Dad, why are you talking
to me like this? I'm your son.

309
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,551
I'm not buying that crap anymore.

310
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:04,555
Today I saw my own son
use a bicycle as a weapon.

311
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,433
You yelled "rape"
at the top of your lungs.

312
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,937
Mom, I honestly thought
I was gonna be raped for a second.

313
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,607
He had the craziest look in his eyes.

314
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,276
And at one point he said,
"Let's get it on."

315
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,488
That was about the fighting.
I'm so not a raper.

316
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,448
I didn't touch your drum set, okay?

317
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:27,745
I witnessed with my eyes
your testicles touching my drum set.

318
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,456
All right, that's it! That's it!

319
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,625
You two guys leave me no choice.

320
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,418
No television for a week.

321
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,711
-What?!
-What?!

322
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,005
-We are so serious, guys.
-You're fucking high!

323
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,423
Are you out of your mind?

324
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,426
This goes in Robert's wall safe
and it's gonna stay there.

325
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,428
-No!
-Okay.

326
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:48,265
-This house is a fucking prison!
-On planet Bullshit!

327
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,644
In the galaxy of
This Sucks Camel Dicks!

328
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,261
Hi! Aunt Carol. Aunt Carol.

329
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,599
-Hey.
-You can't catch me.

330
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,689
I gotcha.

331
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,399
I gotcha.

332
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,031
Aunt Carol's on fire!

333
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,800
I don't know where you learned it.

334
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,720
-Well, there's lots more where that--
-My God.

335
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,389
-Oh, no. What happened?
-What the--?

336
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,434
Oh, my God.

337
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,688
Maybe Dale left the back door open
and raccoons got in.

338
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,232
Nancy? Is this your purse
in the freezer?

339
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,235
Yes. It's Brennan.

340
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,906
He sleepwalks and he always
puts my purse in the freezer.

341
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,699
Dale sleepwalks too.

342
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,368
-Are you kidding me?
-I'm not. Look in the oven.

343
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,623
-What's in the--? Couch pillows?
-Couch pillows.

344
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,249
Yeah, Dale.

345
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,377
Come on.

346
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,421
-It's okay.
-It's really hard.

347
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,798
It's gonna be fine.

348
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,469
They're gonna get jobs,
they'll be gone in a month. A month.

349
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,226
Guys.

350
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,398
-Guys. Guys!
-I'll kill you, Leonard Nimoy.

351
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,609
The clown has no penis.

352
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,320
What kind of dreams
are you guys having?

353
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,072
Hey, it's 12:30.

354
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,991
Brennan, your brother's
coming today, so get up.

355
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,493
-Today?
-Yep.

356
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,955
-Shit.
-What's your problem?

357
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,916
My little brother's even
a bigger asshole than you are.

358
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,961
All right, let's really nail it this time.
Here we go.

359
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:26,590
A one, a two, a one, two, three, four.

360
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:49,279
All right, Tommy, you're the oldest.
I'm counting on you. Come on.

361
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:04,294
Nice vibrato, buddy.
All right, all right, Alice, let's go.

362
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,924
Flat. It's so flat.

363
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,969
I can't even-- You don't even
look good while you're singing.

364
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,887
The worst thing I've ever heard.

365
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,182
This is $1200 a week for
voice lessons, and this is what I get?

366
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,143
Okay, I'm gonna save it
with this solo.

367
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,646
I'm Derek

368
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:27,443
And I can sing high like this

369
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,321
And I can sing high

370
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,659
Jesus!

371
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,510
We were so sad you guys
couldn't come to the wedding.

372
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,345
-But we completely understand.
-Yeah.

373
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,431
You were busy fishing
with Mark Cuban.

374
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,600
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Well, not just the Cubes...

375
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:03,145
...but we had Chris Daughtry,
Jeff Probst, super-chef Bobby Flay.

376
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,397
It was insane.
I mean, it was almost too much.

377
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,899
My God, that's impressive.

378
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,401
Yeah, we were down in the Gulf,
fishing bonito.

379
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,529
Robert, have you ever been down
to the Gulf on the bonito run?

380
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,531
Always wanted to.
I hear it's amazing.

381
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,201
-It is. It's gorgeous.
-Are bonito fish big?

382
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,703
What?

383
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,872
Don't interrupt
when he's telling a story.

384
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,541
-It's fine, Robert.
-I was asking about the story.

385
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,711
-What's this guy's deal?
-I don't know, son. It's okay.

386
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:31,465
Well, Dale, they are
what's called a trophy fish.

387
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:35,302
So, yeah, they're pretty big.

388
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:36,929
I'm sorry.

389
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,058
Anyway....

390
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,436
Oh, God, I'm sorry,
I forget where my story was going.

391
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,813
Damn it, Dale.

392
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,231
-No--
-Robert.

393
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,565
-What?
-What? I asked him.

394
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,443
No, he can join in, Robert.
It's really okay.

395
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,487
Well, I asked him twice
not to interrupt.

396
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:57,449
Gang, don't be mad at Dale for ruining
the story. And possibly the evening.

397
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,743
It's totally fine.
I have a lot more stories.

398
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,247
-Derek, that you do. That you do.
-Yeah.

399
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:07,000
-Guilty as charged with the stories.
-Oh, God, you're impressive.

400
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,920
Come on. I love talking to you.

401
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,799
From across the room,
I feel like we have a thing.

402
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:18,095
You and me, man. You're my
new stepdad. You're unbelievable.

403
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:22,349
-I never heard that laugh before.
-Dad, why are you acting so weird?

404
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,935
Oh, hey, by the way, guys,
where's my bro, Brennan?

405
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:37,614
You're right about your brother.
Total dick.

406
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,283
Told you.

407
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,076
You know what? I still hate you...

408
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,954
...but you got a pretty awesome
collection of nudie mags.

409
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,623
Yeah, I got them
from the '70s, '80s and '90s.

410
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,127
It's like masturbating
in a time machine.

411
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,298
Anyway, so I figure by the summer
of 2010, we can probably set sail.

412
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,342
But I think about it
every day of my life.

413
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,803
Let me ask you this, Bob,
why wait two years?

414
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,055
-Well, I gotta make more money.
-Okay, look.

415
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,473
I hear you, believe me.

416
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,476
But what if I were to tell you
that I could sell this house...

417
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,395
...for 30 percent above market?

418
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:12,065
-That'd be great. Could you do it?
-Yeah. In a heartbeat, Robby.

419
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,527
Look, I got my real-estate license
a few years back for shits and gigs.

420
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,362
I'd do it for four-fifths commish...

421
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,823
...because you know what really
gets my dick hard?

422
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,241
Helping out my friends.

423
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,244
That'd be fantastic.
That'd be fanta-- Oh, my God.

424
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,747
-No, it would be kick-ass, bro.
-Oh, man.

425
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,540
Right there.

426
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,668
What about Dale and Brennan?

427
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,879
Because they haven't
even gotten jobs yet.

428
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,506
God, change the record.

429
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,467
Sweet!

430
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,263
Robert. Don't talk to me like that
in front of my son.

431
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,767
Oh, come on. We're talking about
our dream, the boat. Come on.

432
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:50,812
Yeah, it's our dream, but I think it
all needs to be done in good time.

433
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,524
I'm just saying give it some thought,
okay? That's it. That's all I'm saying.

434
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,861
Holy shit, triplets.

435
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,697
It's true, three's company.

436
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,866
-It shows tons of bush.
-Hey, hey, careful.

437
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,202
Careful with that. You're crinkling.

438
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,413
That's a collector's item.
It's worth a lot of money.

439
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,873
What's up, faggots?

440
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,210
What's up, man? What, you're not
gonna come down, say hi to me?

441
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:14,419
Hi, Derek.

442
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,506
Whoa, calm down, man.
I'm just joking.

443
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,634
You guys, I really like
your guys' setup up here.

444
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,386
What is your problem, man?

445
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,973
My problem? I don't know.
I don't have a problem, Dale.

446
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,392
Actually, I have the opposite
of a problem:

447
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,061
I made over 550 K last year.
How much did you make?

448
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,730
-It's not about money.
-No, it's not about money.

449
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,983
Well, for me,
it's a little bit about money...

450
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,235
...and I made
that much money last year.

451
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:39,861
I am the VP of the biggest...

452
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:43,740
...executive-helicopter-leasing
company on the Western Seaboard.

453
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,827
Okay? I haven't had a carb
since 2004.

454
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:50,289
Check these out. See these?
See these boys?

455
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,790
This is what I live with.

456
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,459
Every day I lather this up
with Kiehl's in the shower.

457
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,296
You wanna touch this shit?
You wanna touch these bad boys?

458
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,673
Sorry, not gonna happen.

459
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,258
Is there something you want?

460
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,176
I promised Mom I'd offer you a job.

461
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,263
I told her it'd count as her
Christmas present, so....

462
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,307
No. I'm never gonna work for you.

463
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,641
Fine. I don't care.

464
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,270
The truth is I just smoked a J
out in my car a few minutes ago...

465
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,397
...so feeling a little spacey.

466
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,607
Know what I'm say--?
What's up with you, man?

467
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:19,901
What you looking at, kemosabe?

468
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,403
You--

469
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,072
You wanna punch me right now.

470
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,451
You wanna punch me right now,
but you won't.

471
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,536
You wanna punch me too?

472
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:32,456
You guys both look like you might
wanna hit me in the face.

473
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,791
You do, I can tell.
Well, why don't you do it?

474
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,543
Why don't you punch me
in the face?

475
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,337
Punch me in the fucking face!

476
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,637
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, my shoulder!

477
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,056
That was awesome.

478
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,224
Mom! Mom!

479
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,769
Derek, know what's always good
for shoulder pain?

480
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,229
-What?
-If you lick my butthole.

481
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,190
Snap!

482
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,485
-Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Bobby.
-Sure.

483
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,988
Aside from that retard trying to punch
me, it was a pretty good evening.

484
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:08,575
-It was our pleasure, son.
-Why are you calling him that?

485
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:09,993
Oh, don't, don't.

486
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,954
Bye, kids. I'll check out that stock
you recommended, Tommy.

487
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,164
Excuse me.

488
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:17,793
-Hi. I'm Alice, I'm Derek's wife.
-Hi.

489
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,421
Is it true you struck Derek in the face
and he fell from the tree house?

490
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,090
Yeah. He asked me to.

491
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,550
Oh, that's the most amazing thing
I've ever heard.

492
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,344
I want you to know that tonight...

493
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:31,014
...I am gonna pleasure myself to
the image of you doing that to Derek.

494
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,808
You know what I mean?

495
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,601
Masturbate.

496
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,436
I am.

497
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,271
Oh, Dale.

498
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,357
You are something.

499
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,443
You are something.

500
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,154
You're something too.

501
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,866
I wanna roll you into a little ball
and shove you up my vagina.

502
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,746
You could just live there.
It's warm and it's cozy.

503
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,039
In your vagina?

504
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:59,626
I wanna walk around with you
in there and just know that...

505
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,295
...whenever I feel a little tickle
or scratch...

506
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,799
...that it's just your hair
up my vagina.

507
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,051
Please, just do it for me.

508
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,719
What's happening?

509
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,682
Kiss me.

510
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,230
I know. I know. It's too much.

511
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,774
It's too much.

512
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,488
I hate my life, Dale.

513
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:32,117
Dale, I hate my life!
I have nobody to talk to.

514
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,244
-Well, you seemed okay at the di--
-Please.

515
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,329
Alice! Honey, come on!

516
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,125
Dane Cook, pay-per-view,
20 minutes. Let's go!

517
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,670
Coming, honey!
I'm just talking to Dale.

518
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:46,381
This is so stupid.

519
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,800
Call me.

520
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,220
-I love you.
-Okay.

521
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,812
-Hey. What'd she want?
-What?

522
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:04,733
Nothing. Who's--? Who?

523
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:06,776
Alice.

524
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:10,947
We were just talking. Not--
It was not about sex or anything.

525
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,326
I can't believe you hit Derek.

526
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,120
I know. Did you see
the expression on his face?

527
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:20,207
-That was cool.
-Listen.

528
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:23,376
I know that we started out as foe.

529
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,296
But after that courageous act...

530
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:29,549
...that you showed me
against the one they call Derek...

531
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:34,471
...maybe someday
we could become friends.

532
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:38,975
Friends who ride majestic,
translucent steeds...

533
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,312
...shooting flaming arrows
across the Bridge of Hemdale.

534
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:46,483
I would follow you into the mists
of Avalon, if that's what you mean.

535
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,986
Do you wanna see something cool
that only three people have seen?

536
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,451
Okay, open your eyes.

537
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,163
See that black smudge
right there on the blade?

538
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,165
-Yeah.
-Look at it closely.

539
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,793
-Pretty recognizable signature.
-No.

540
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,379
Randy Jackson from American Idol.

541
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:10,715
Why do you have Randy Jackson's
autograph on a martial-arts weapon?

542
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,343
I bumped into him
and all I had was this sword...

543
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,263
...and you're not gonna not get
Randy Jackson's autograph.

544
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,848
I would've done
the exact same thing.

545
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,936
Now, do you wanna see
something really cool?

546
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,230
-Of course.
-Turn off the lights.

547
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:31,027
Industrial-strength
night-vision goggles.

548
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,862
Holy Santa Claus shit.

549
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,116
Can you imagine if we had these
when we were 12?

550
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:38,535
Even better.
We got them when we're 40.

551
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:43,206
You know what's amazing? They're
not that noticeable on your face.

552
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,125
-Right?
-Yeah.

553
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,754
I can't believe I've been living here
for two weeks...

554
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,756
...and I'm walking
around this place...

555
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,551
...thinking I've got a huge doucher
for a stepbrother.

556
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,053
Secretly, you're not a doucher.

557
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,055
Let's play a game, all right?

558
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,891
On the count of three,
name your favorite dinosaur.

559
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,437
Don't even think about it, just name it.
Ready? One, two, three.

560
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,105
-Velociraptor.
-Velociraptor.

561
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,775
Favorite non-pornographic magazine
to masturbate to.

562
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,278
-Good Housekeeping.
-Good Housekeeping.

563
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,281
If you were a chick, who's
the one guy you'd sleep with?

564
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:17,866
-John Stamos.
-John Stamos.

565
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,327
-What?
-Did we just become best friends?

566
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,911
Yep.

567
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,164
Do you wanna go do karate
in the garage?

568
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,749
Yup!

569
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,936
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

570
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,027
I think they're starting to
like each other.

571
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,613
I got a really bad feeling about this.

572
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,783
-Sword fight!
-I know.

573
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,159
Sword fight!

574
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,333
-Exactly the same!
-I know! That's so weird.

575
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,046
Now you're in trouble.

576
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:16,341
-Come on!
-No!

577
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,802
They're betting against you,
but you can do it!

578
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,471
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

579
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,349
Is this a bad time?

580
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,892
What the hell's going on?

581
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,978
Ma, Mr. Doback, okay,
Dale and I were just--

582
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,980
Please, stop calling me Mr. Doback.

583
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,482
Sorry. Okay.

584
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:35,276
Mom, Doback...

585
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:38,154
...we think it would be very prudent--

586
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,824
-Can we turn our beds into bunk beds?
-Yes.

587
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,826
Why are you guys so sweaty?

588
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,870
We've already figured out how.
The beds match up perfectly.

589
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,290
It would give us so much extra space
in our room to do activities.

590
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,500
Please say yes.

591
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,961
You don't need our permission
to build bunk beds.

592
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,338
You're adults.
You can do what you want.

593
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,590
So...?

594
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,052
I'm not making myself clear.

595
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,763
I don't give a fuck.

596
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,349
Now, you both have
several interviews tomorrow.

597
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:10,019
I would think you'd be focused
on that and not building bunk beds.

598
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,774
-So...?
-So...?

599
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:19,195
-We can? No?
-Yes. Yes, you can make bunk beds.

600
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,614
-I knew it.
-Okay. You are not gonna regret this.

601
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,575
We'll get so much more
activities done.

602
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:26,703
This is the funnest night ever!

603
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,206
This is so scary.

604
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,753
-How you doing over there?
-Really good.

605
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,212
Okay.

606
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,423
Does your son know anything
about carpentry?

607
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,176
No, not a th-- Did I hear a drill?

608
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,012
-Dale! Dale, no power tools!
-Power tools.

609
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,347
-What?
-No power tools!

610
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:50,185
-No, I forgot, I have to brush my teeth.
-That is not your toothbrush.

611
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,854
Oh, okay. Well, I'm all done anyway.

612
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,355
-We did it.
-We did it!

613
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,607
It looks amazing!

614
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,860
Look at that! That looks like
what you'd buy from a store!

615
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,696
-Should've been a bunk bed all along.
-Look at this space.

616
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,741
-We could do aerobics in here.
-So many activities!

617
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,951
-Do step class.
-It's making my head spin...

618
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,412
-...how many activities we can do.
-Play Army men.

619
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:10,872
-Yeah.
-Come on.

620
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,296
Hey, I never asked you.
Do you like guacamole?

621
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,759
Oh, Brennan! Oh, God!

622
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:25,094
Brennan! Brennan!

623
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,806
Dad. Nancy. It's bad.

624
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,099
It's so bad.
There's blood everywhere.

625
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,895
The bunk beds were a terrible idea.
Why'd you let us do that?

626
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,313
It's so bad!

627
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,773
How would you describe that?

628
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,487
-It's not so bad.
-Right. See?

629
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,365
Put your beds back.

630
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,659
Rumpus time is over.

631
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,954
You got a big day tomorrow.
You need your eight hours.

632
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:57,710
And although she was 88 years old,
she never stopped believing.

633
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,629
It's 8:20 in the a.m.

634
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,632
Coming up next, a recent study
by the American Council....

635
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,801
Look at her. She's hot.

636
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:09,222
Okay, guys, this is it.
Good luck. Don't be late.

637
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,975
Dad, I need to borrow
some clothes for the interview...

638
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,977
...since I don't have
any fancy clothes.

639
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,438
You go in my closet, take whatever
you need. You guys gotta look sharp.

640
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,607
This is the most important
day of our lives.

641
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,234
-Okay.
-No pressure, no pressure.

642
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,610
-All right? Relax.
-Okay.

643
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:23,862
I gotta go. I gotta go.

644
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,030
This is your day.
Remember that. You own it.

645
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,074
-This is your one day!
-All right.

646
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:32,328
Mr. Huff, Mr. Jeener
is ready for your interview.

647
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,664
Actually, we'll be
interviewing as a team.

648
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,083
We're here to fuck shit up.

649
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,339
Move it!

650
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,224
Hey!

651
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,894
Well, Brennan, you certainly
have had a lot of jobs.

652
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,437
I'm a bit of a spark plug.

653
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:00,106
And, Human Resources lady,
when I think--

654
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:03,192
-You know, it's-- Actually, it's Pam.
-I'm sorry.

655
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,279
-Well, Pan....
-No, my name is Pam.

656
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:10,533
-Are you saying Pan or Pam?
-I'm saying Pam.

657
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,037
Yeah, I'm sorry, who is this
gentleman sitting behind you?

658
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,165
Hello, Ms. Lady. I'm Dale.
I'm Brennan's stepbrother...

659
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:20,793
...and I think I might be able to help
with the Pan-Pam dilemma.

660
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,879
-Yeah, that'd be great.
-Pam.

661
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,714
-Pan.
-Pam.

662
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,883
-Pand. There's a D on the end.
-With an M.

663
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:32,555
-There's no D. It's Pam.
-It's like "comb," except P-A-N-M.

664
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,433
-N-N. There's two N's.
-Two M's. That was the confusion.

665
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,935
No, there's just one M.

666
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,145
What do you say we interview you?

667
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:42,482
All right. Yes, that's a
sometimes-useful exercise.

668
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,025
Please put your hand down.

669
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,401
Go ahead.

670
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,905
How much money do you make
a year before taxes?

671
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,783
Okay, I'm actually not comfortable
answering that.

672
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,577
-Come on!
-We're doing the interview, not you.

673
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:58,498
Here's a shot out of a cannon:
Oprah, Barbara Walters, your wife.

674
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,917
You gotta fuck one,
marry one, kill one. Go!

675
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,710
I think we're done here. Thank you.

676
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,754
First of all,
I needed someone to work--

677
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,673
Wait, shut your mouth.
Shut your mouth.

678
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,132
I think we've had enough--

679
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,343
-Shush up for one second.
-Shut your mouth.

680
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,429
-Wait, shut your mouth.
-I'm sorry, what did you just say?

681
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,140
-You're just coming off stupid.
-I'm coming off stupid?

682
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:20,103
You're wearing tuxedos to a job that
requires you to clean bathrooms.

683
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,982
-Please leave this office, we're done.
-Do we get any sort of souvenir?

684
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,775
Get out of my office!

685
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:29,654
I'm looking to hire guys I don't mind
hanging out with for 12 hours a day.

686
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,280
You guys seem like cool guys.

687
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,450
Got hair similar to mine,
you wear tuxedos to the interview.

688
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,452
That's funny, it's ironic. I get that.

689
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:40,289
Underplaying the whole formality of it.
I think that's funny as hell.

690
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:43,292
So let's do this, you know?
You guys are hired. You're in.

691
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,170
Unless you're the weirdest guys ever
and I don't see it.

692
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,839
Great.

693
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,859
-Was that a fart?
-I don't know.

694
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,902
I can taste it.

695
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,195
On my tongue.

696
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,823
Okay, I'll be honest with you.
I did fart.

697
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,993
Is that onion? Onion and--
Onion and ketchup.

698
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,997
-It stinks. And this is a small room.
-Shit.

699
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,499
Okay, now the tuxedos
seem kind of fucked up.

700
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:28,463
God. We were so close.

701
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,924
So, what do we do for jobs?
Is your dad really gonna kick us out?

702
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:36,220
Listen, don't worry about my dad.

703
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,057
Got him sewn up.

704
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,393
We've gotta start thinking bigger,
though, Brennan.

705
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,688
Listen, what are you really good at?

706
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:48,524
Singing. I'm a world-class singer.

707
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,402
See? Right there,
that's an amazing skill.

708
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,029
Now, what am I good at?

709
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:56,032
I can shred on the drums
and I'm a marketing wiz.

710
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:58,034
Put all that together,
what do you get?

711
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,538
-I don't know, a band?
-No, that's been done before.

712
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:07,877
Even better: we are gonna start an
international entertainment company.

713
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:10,213
The biggest and the best.

714
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,716
And we're gonna call it
Prestige Worldwide.

715
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,718
That sounds so cool.

716
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:20,139
I feel like a lightning bolt
hit the tip of my penis.

717
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,725
Yeah. Yeah.

718
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,895
We're brothers. This is why we met.

719
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:28,064
-To form this alliance, right?
-Right?

720
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:30,733
That's why our parents met,
so this idea could happen.

721
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,736
-Okay, what do we do?
-We get to work.

722
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:37,240
And we hit the beat laboratory
right now. Let's go.

723
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,950
-What?
-Wait.

724
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,618
What time is it?

725
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,286
-4:30.
-4:30.

726
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,372
4:32.

727
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,336
-I can't go down Whitworth right now.
-Okay.

728
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,421
We should go this way.

729
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,716
-What's up?
-Chris Gardocki.

730
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,176
-What?
-He gets in my face...

731
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,679
...and I just don't wanna
deal with the hassle now.

732
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:02,640
-Are you this scared?
-Can we please go the long way?

733
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,935
-Down Cutler?
-Yeah.

734
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,854
But that's 45 minutes.

735
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,772
You're gonna shame me
into doing this.

736
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:12,441
-You sound stupid.
-You'll be sorry. Okay, I'm stupid.

737
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,735
Oh, man.

738
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,156
Oh, God, there they are.

739
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:21,617
Oh, my God, is that Dale Doback?

740
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,328
-Let's make him lick dog shit.
-Yeah.

741
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:29,333
Hey, fag-stick. Long time, no see.

742
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,128
Is that your boyfriend?
Is that your butt buddy?

743
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,714
Look, Mr. Gardocki,
just leave me alone, will you?

744
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,674
Shut your mouth, esé.

745
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:40,011
You guys just go back and have fun
on your jungle gym, okay?

746
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,388
Does butt buddy have a name?

747
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:46,475
If you're referring to me as
butt buddy, yes, I do have a name.

748
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:47,977
It's Brennan Huff.

749
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:51,314
If you don't come over here
and lick that white dog shit...

750
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,690
...I'm gonna plow into your nose
with my fist.

751
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:57,737
-I'm not licking any white dog shit.
-I'll lick the shit if you leave us alone.

752
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:01,073
Dale, you're not licking
dog shit, okay? They're kids.

753
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,492
-Brennan, it's just dog shit.
-It's ridiculous!

754
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:07,663
-Hello, how are--?
-Oh, God!

755
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,583
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

756
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,753
Get them!

757
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:29,060
So maybe you don't
go down that way anymore.

758
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,103
Maybe you go the long way home.

759
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,190
That's what we talked about.
We'll take the long way home.

760
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:37,109
You know in that one scene
in The Wizard of Oz...

761
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,112
...when the flying monkeys
pull apart the Scarecrow?

762
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,323
That's what it was like.

763
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,992
-It's okay, it's okay.
-I'm so sorry.

764
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,787
Is my dad mad about
the stuff that happened?

765
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:50,539
Robert was very upset, yes.

766
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,417
He knows that you interviewed
as a team.

767
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,127
And he heard about the fart.

768
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,213
-Oh, he did?
-Yeah.

769
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,131
You just couldn't hold it, or you--?

770
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,218
-No. I thought it was gonna be silent.
-It was not silent.

771
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:05,054
Just kept going, and it made a sound.
It was embarrassing.

772
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,264
It got louder.

773
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,308
So listen, Bobby,
I'll get those keys made tomorrow...

774
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:12,979
-...and then we'll start setting up times.
-Thank you.

775
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,690
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi.

776
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,066
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

777
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:19,443
-Always nice to see you.
-You too.

778
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:30,162
Hey, guys.

779
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,415
Looks like your
free ride's over, huh?

780
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,417
Have fun living on the streets.

781
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:37,503
Okay, cool. Good chatting, you guys.
Bye, Mom.

782
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,921
-Bye.
-See you, buddy.

783
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,385
What was he doing here?

784
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,387
We're putting the house
on the market.

785
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,099
-Where are we moving?
-Is the house haunted?

786
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,935
Nancy and I are retiring...

787
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:55,855
...and sailing around the world
on my boat.

788
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:58,316
We are living the dream.

789
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,775
Well, what about us?

790
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:06,198
I'm sorry. Robert-- We thought that...

791
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:10,161
...you should take responsibility
for your own lives.

792
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,537
This is the exciting part:

793
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:14,040
We're going to put enough
money in your accounts...

794
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,167
...for a security deposit
on an apartment.

795
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:17,626
What's this all about?

796
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:22,298
More than just money, we're gonna get
you another kind of support as well.

797
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:25,301
You're both gonna see therapists.
Nancy thinks it'll help.

798
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:29,221
-Guys, that's nonnegotiable.
-Hold on. We're not going on the boat...

799
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:32,725
...Derek's selling the house,
we have to go to therapy?

800
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,852
-What the fuck happened?
-Hey!

801
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,148
Look, I know this seems
really, really sudden...

802
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,650
...and just sort of unfair
and cruel and--

803
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,904
-But it's nonnegotiable.
-But it's nonnegotiable.

804
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,490
I got a bellyful
of white dog crap in me...

805
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,575
...and now you lay this shit on me?

806
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:52,703
You're adults. It's time
you started acting like adults.

807
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,915
-Mom.
-I'm not backing down, Brennan.

808
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:57,500
Don't even try.

809
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,753
I know it seems hard,
but it's the best thing for both of you.

810
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,546
We do it because we love you.

811
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:06,425
Dad, I'm doing this because
I love you: fuck you.

812
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,594
-Anything else?
-No.

813
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:11,180
Bon voyage! Have a great time!

814
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,100
Hey, what's up, Derek?

815
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,309
Yeah.

816
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:16,769
-Know what?
-Look what I got.

817
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:20,189
I'm sitting here thinking we finally got
a family together here...

818
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:23,859
...and now it's about to be taken away
because they think we're losers.

819
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:28,239
-Because they don't understand us?
-Yeah.

820
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:31,908
They don't get that this lifestyle
is a choice.

821
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:35,204
And all they think about
is that stupid boat.

822
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:38,749
I swear, I'm so pissed off
at my mom.

823
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:42,420
As soon as she is of age,
I'm putting her in a home.

824
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:45,339
We have got to get
Prestige Worldwide going.

825
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,550
It's the thing that's
gonna save this family.

826
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,553
I was thinking we should
have a investor presentation...

827
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,971
...like on The Apprentice.

828
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:54,306
We gotta start
with some capital somewhere.

829
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,392
Here's the thing, though:

830
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,728
If we're gonna start
a huge multinational corporation...

831
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,439
...I have to hear you sing.

832
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,316
Can't you just trust that
I'm a really, really good singer?

833
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:08,112
Just one song, so I know
what your voice sounds like.

834
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,406
Yeah, yeah. I'll just do it.

835
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:14,743
No big deal. I'll just dive into it
and just start singing.

836
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:21,834
Jesus, my heart is beating
so fast right now.

837
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:24,753
Okay, just do it. Just do it.

838
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,962
Just--

839
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:16,514
You know, I don't know.

840
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,975
I didn't sing too loud, because I don't
wanna wake up Robert and Nancy.

841
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:23,562
My throat's sore. I've had
a sore throat for a month and a half.

842
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:26,565
And this is not an acoustic
environment that's suitable...

843
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,817
...to request this from me.

844
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:32,238
You gotta know,
I'm not just some guy.

845
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:35,908
Brennan, that is
the voice of an angel.

846
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,329
Brennan, I can't even make
eye contact with you right now.

847
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:43,249
Your voice is like a combination
of Fergie and Jesus.

848
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,292
Why can't you do that
in front of people?

849
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,294
Are you messing with me right now?

850
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,381
It's me, Dale.

851
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:52,675
You're good.

852
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,719
-I know.
-This is gonna sound weird...

853
00:50:55,886 --> 00:51:01,016
...but for a second, I think
you took on the shape of a unicorn.

854
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:05,020
I felt like I was hovering
above my own body...

855
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,772
...watching myself sing.

856
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:08,691
Now, let's move on
to other business.

857
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:12,361
First thing tomorrow, we gotta get
cracking on this investor presentation.

858
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:15,489
And guess what else.
This just came to me.

859
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:19,075
-We're making a music video.
-Yeah!

860
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,078
What do we do about Derek
and the house?

861
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,874
Don't worry about him.

862
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:37,845
Oh, it's a great "nabe."

863
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,888
Frank Gifford
used to live down the block.

864
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:43,225
-The Giff?
-Yeah, the Giff. Right down the block.

865
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:45,936
I'm getting
a really good feeling about this.

866
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,146
I am so glad.

867
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:49,982
You get us that 10-year
interest-only loan, we got a deal.

868
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:53,152
Hey, fuckers!
Welcome to the neighborhood!

869
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:57,113
-My name is Craig.
-The neighbor is a Nazi?

870
00:51:57,281 --> 00:52:01,160
You guys ever need fertilizer,
I've got a lot of it. Close to 80 tons.

871
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:05,247
Hey, folks! How you doing?
You're gonna love this neighborhood.

872
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:07,082
Every single house here recycles.

873
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,168
-Okay, we're done here.
-Yeah, okay.

874
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:12,296
Hey, Derek, sprechen sie dick.

875
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:15,090
Dale, I don't know how much
you know about therapy...

876
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:18,427
...but it usually starts by you
telling me something about yourself.

877
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,055
I work at a college as a janitor...

878
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,849
...even though I'm smarter
than most of the people there.

879
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:26,935
Sometimes I see an equation
written on a blackboard...

880
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:30,105
...like half an equation,
and I'll just figure it out.

881
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,608
-Is this Good Will Hunting?
-No.

882
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:35,778
It sounds a lot like the plot
of Good Will Hunting.

883
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:39,657
Yeah. Anyway.
My best friend is Ben Affleck....

884
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,951
So I thought we'd begin
talking about your parents' divorce.

885
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,286
Okay.

886
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:46,455
How old were you
when they got divorced?

887
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:48,791
-Fifteen.
-That's a hard age.

888
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:51,877
-Yes. Yeah.
-Do you wanna talk...

889
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:54,170
-...about some of those feelings?
-I love you.

890
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:57,800
-Obviously, you don't know me.
-I love you so much.

891
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:01,345
Thank you. And I will take that
as a feeling that you have...

892
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:03,889
...of comfortability with me.

893
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,724
It's more than comfortability.

894
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:09,103
-I mean, I fucking love you.
-Okay. I th--

895
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,146
I'm just thinking
about our life together.

896
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,691
I feel like I'm walking on a cloud.

897
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,984
My penis is tingling right now.

898
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:19,863
-That is so off-putting.
-You're not feeling this?

899
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:23,992
In no way, shape or form do I feel
any feelings of intimacy towards you...

900
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,161
...in any way whatsoever.

901
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,163
You got a really dope
front lawn here.

902
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,249
You and your homeboys
can play on that.

903
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:32,376
-You can just say "It looks good."
-Yeah.

904
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,585
No, that's how I talk.

905
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:37,089
Oh, you got a really fresh
entryway here. Pretty awesome.

906
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:39,925
--show you the front of the house,
which is actual--

907
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:44,179
Will you vultures please give us some
privacy? He just died last night.

908
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,848
What is going on here?

909
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:48,350
It was the asbestos in here,
that's what did it!

910
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:49,977
I've seen too many dead bodies.

911
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,521
-I can't be in here. I can't.
-No, no, no.

912
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:58,485
-Not bad.
-Eat shit, Derek.

913
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:02,281
-Awesome B-day party, broheisens.
-You the man, Derek.

914
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,825
Okay, who's this from? TJ?

915
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,952
Where are
the rest of my gifts, dude?

916
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,954
Totally joking around, TJ.

917
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:10,372
All right.

918
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:14,918
Oh, yes! Yes! Callaway 3-wood.

919
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,378
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

920
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,297
Yeah.

921
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:21,049
-Bomb it down the fairway, bitches!
-That's right.

922
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:26,305
Hi, my name is Jim.
Wanna suck my dick for money?

923
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:29,099
-It's just me. Hi.
-Oh, my God.

924
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:31,560
What are you doing?
This is the men's bathroom.

925
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:33,562
Happy anniversary.

926
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:36,064
-It's our second date.
-What?

927
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:40,194
Listen, I'm sick of being
all coy and bashful, Dale. Okay?

928
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,238
-We're in the bathroom.
-This'll just take a minute.

929
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:46,658
There's really little you can
do about it. Let me just hop on.

930
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,204
It's all slippery.

931
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,206
Oh, my God!

932
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,422
It's getting tingly.
Something's gonna happen, Alice!

933
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,724
Oh, we just had sex.

934
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:14,269
-Just the way I imagined it.
-I like you.

935
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,438
I love you.

936
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:18,774
-Stay golden, Ponyboy. I gotta pee.
-Okay.

937
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,945
Oh, my God.

938
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,197
You're incredible.

939
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:27,783
Say hello to my little friend.

940
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:32,328
-Just kidding. It's from Scarface.
-Scarface.

941
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,666
Shut the fuck up!

942
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,544
-Sweet-ass gift, Teej.
-Yeah, not bad.

943
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:40,462
-I got it all mapped out.
-Okay.

944
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:43,966
-I'm following your lead, though.
-I'll get all eyes on us.

945
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,467
-Okay.
-Just like we planned.

946
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,761
And then we'll drop the hammer.

947
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,765
Everyone, if I could have
your attention, please.

948
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,309
For those of you
who don't know me...

949
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:57,396
-...my name's Dale Doback.
-Check. Check.

950
00:55:57,563 --> 00:56:00,274
Probably wondering
why we gathered you here tonight...

951
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,234
...besides Derek's birthday.

952
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:05,821
We got a special surprise for you,
Derek, and everybody here--

953
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:07,072
-Check, check.
-Check.

954
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,199
-Dale. No, please.
-Don't interrupt them.

955
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:11,367
-I'm begging you.
-You wanna shut this down?

956
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,495
-Just hold on.
-Derek, for your birthday...

957
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,080
...we thought we'd roll out...

958
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:17,457
...a once-in-a-lifetime
business opportunity.

959
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:18,750
Happy birthday, Derek.

960
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:20,544
Music.

961
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:29,219
Prestige Worldwide,
wide, wide, wide.

962
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,680
Prestige Worldwide.

963
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:34,641
-The first word in entertainment.
-First word.

964
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,852
-Management.
-Financial portfolios.

965
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:38,854
-Insurance.
-Computers.

966
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:42,357
-Black leather gloves.
-Research and development.

967
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:45,485
Putting in the man-hours to study
the science of what you need.

968
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,655
Last week we put Liquid Paper
on a bee...

969
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,115
...and it died.

970
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:51,658
-Security.
-Security.

971
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,076
-And--
-And.

972
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,997
-Possibly you.
-Possibly you.

973
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,292
-Oh, this is classic. This is--
-We'd like to present...

974
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:04,713
...the world premiere of Prestige
Worldwide's first music video...

975
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,051
...by our first act, Huff and Doback.

976
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:12,220
-Roll it.
-Roll it.

977
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:16,516
Pay close attention, Dad.
It's gonna look familiar.

978
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,603
-This is-- This is perfect.
-Is that my boat?

979
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,064
Yes, it is.

980
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:23,815
What are you doing on my boat?

981
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,485
The Niña, the Pinta
The Santa María

982
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:29,196
I'll do you in the bottom
While you're drinking sangria

983
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,782
Nachos and Lemonheads
On my dad's boat

984
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,992
You won't go down
'Cause my dick can float

985
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,745
We sail around the world
And go port to port

986
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:39,498
Every time I come
I produce a quart

987
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:41,959
That is offensive. Brennan, Dale.

988
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,586
I gotta have me my boats and ho's

989
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:46,922
Deadliest Catch without the crabs

990
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:49,716
We're almost out of gas
Call the Arabs

991
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,135
Pull up the anchor
'Cause we're leaving dry land

992
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,805
Get below deck
With a dick in your hand

993
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:57,224
Boats and ho's
Boats and ho's

994
00:57:57,391 --> 00:58:00,185
I gotta have me my boats and ho's

995
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:02,562
Are you ready for some
world-class vocalization?

996
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,398
-Get a partner.
-Wait a minute.

997
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,192
-Who's steering the boat?
-Dad, please shut up.

998
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,610
Please shut up!

999
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,163
Yeah!

1000
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:27,254
So...

1001
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,673
...big question is:

1002
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:33,719
Aside from the damage to the boat,
which we will fix...

1003
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,638
...what'd you think
of the presentation?

1004
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:42,894
Brennan, I think that what you did
to Robert's boat was horrid.

1005
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,397
Having said that,
I think that both of you boys...

1006
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:49,026
...showed a lot of enthusiasm
and inventiveness.

1007
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,278
Yes. Thank you.

1008
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,572
You gotta be kidding me.

1009
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:57,075
They destroyed our dream
and you're calling it inventive.

1010
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,828
-No, no, no. I didn't mean it like that.
-Yes, you did.

1011
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,246
Come on, you did.

1012
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:05,000
It's gonna be four years, at least,
before we can sail anywhere.

1013
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:08,545
-And you could care less, admit it.
-I will not admit that...

1014
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:11,131
-...because it is not true.
-Oh, yeah.

1015
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:14,342
But, you know,
I do think that you could show...

1016
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:18,597
...a little bit more attentiveness
to your son and your stepson...

1017
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:20,432
...who obviously need you.

1018
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:21,850
It's true, Dr. Doback.

1019
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:24,895
You've been very cold
and unsupportive of our dreams.

1020
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,855
You wrecked my fucking boat,
you goon!

1021
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:29,107
Don't speak to my son like that.

1022
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,818
Your son's costing me $80,000.

1023
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:35,197
We could bicker about this all night,
but what's done is done, Dad.

1024
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,200
-Are you guys gonna invest or not?
-That's it! That's it!

1025
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:40,160
-What are you doing?
-Grab the wheel!

1026
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,746
I can't believe
you're being so stingy.

1027
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:45,415
-Robert, come down.
-It's a simple business decision.

1028
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,250
You jackaloons!

1029
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,879
You're failures! Failures!

1030
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:53,882
And you're embarrassing yourself,
you geriatric fuck!

1031
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,509
-Brennan.
-Two things:

1032
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:58,470
You keep your liver-spotted hands
off my beautiful mother.

1033
00:59:58,637 --> 00:59:59,721
She's a saint!

1034
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:03,433
Then you sit down and you write Dale
and Brennan a check for $10,000.

1035
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,643
Oh, stop it.

1036
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:08,688
Or I'm gonna shove one of those fake
hearing devices so far up your ass...

1037
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,607
-Brennan!
-...you can hear the sound...

1038
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:13,610
...of your small intestine
as it produces shit!

1039
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,071
-All right, here we go.
-Oh, my Lord.

1040
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:19,282
Somebody should've done this
a long time ago, and I'm gonna do it.

1041
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,909
-What are you doing?
-Robert.

1042
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,911
There are consequences
for your actions.

1043
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:25,789
-No! Robert!
-Dad!

1044
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:28,083
-This is not the answer.
-You're next, mister.

1045
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,376
-You understand me?
-Yes.

1046
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:32,587
-Certain behaviors...
-Let go of me.

1047
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:36,007
-...will not be tolerated!
-My ass is on fire!

1048
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:50,730
Wow, the tree looks great, Nancy.
Really tasteful.

1049
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:54,442
Thank you, Dale. That's a very nice
sweater you're wearing.

1050
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:58,196
It was my mom's.
I took the shoulder pads out.

1051
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,157
Oh, and, Brennan? Denise called...

1052
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,993
...and she said she can't go out
with you on New Year's Eve...

1053
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,037
...because she's not your girlfriend,
she's your therapist.

1054
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,539
-Is that what she said?
-Yeah.

1055
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:08,790
She's a rascal.

1056
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,293
Hey, Dad, Nancy?

1057
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:16,506
Would it be cool if Brennan and I
opened just one present each...

1058
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,842
...since it's Christmas Eve?

1059
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,887
I'm gonna go down to the
Cheesecake Factory, have a drink.

1060
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:27,642
But it's Christmas Eve.

1061
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:29,603
Merry Christmas.

1062
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,189
-Yes.
-Yeah.

1063
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,566
I had my eye on one.

1064
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:36,902
I hope it's what I think it is.

1065
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,279
Oh, my God. Hulk Hands!

1066
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,947
Wait, Dale got Hulk Hands?

1067
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,497
Well, you reek of Scotch
and cheesecake.

1068
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:51,958
You know...

1069
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:57,505
...tonight at the Cheesecake Factory
was the happiest I've been in months.

1070
01:01:57,923 --> 01:02:01,343
-Well, then I feel very sorry for you.
-Well, just....

1071
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:05,430
Nancy, I don't know if I can ever
forgive them for wrecking my boat.

1072
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:08,308
-Why are you giving up?
-I'm not giving up. I'm not.

1073
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:12,479
-You are. You're giving up on our boys.
-But they're 40.

1074
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:15,607
I don't care how old they are.
They're still our children.

1075
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:18,860
Well, sometime it's got to matter
how old they are.

1076
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:21,738
That's all we do, is--
Oh, sweet Jesus.

1077
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:25,492
Oh, it--
You know, they'll go back to bed.

1078
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:28,078
See? They're sleepwalking.

1079
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,247
No. No.

1080
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,666
See, back to bed.

1081
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,084
They'll be fine.

1082
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:36,962
Just nonsense.
I'm gonna wake them up.

1083
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:40,590
-No. Why would you do such a thing?
-Well, because it's--

1084
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:43,176
-Never, ever wake up a sleepwalker.
-See, that's it.

1085
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:44,803
-We can't ever do anything.
-No.

1086
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,430
But they could do real harm
to themselves or others.

1087
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,183
-Oh, the Christmas presents.
-No, guys-- No, no, don't--

1088
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:52,727
-No. But--
-I think we should take control.

1089
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:56,106
-It's always about them.
-How do you propose to do that?

1090
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:58,441
-Oh, Jesus.
-Whatever you do, don't wake them.

1091
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,653
They might do real harm
to themselves or others.

1092
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,656
-Not everybody does know that.
-Oh, the Christmas tree!

1093
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:07,993
Oh, not the-- No, don't--
All right, that's it!

1094
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,828
-I'm waking them up!
-No! No!

1095
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:11,621
-Don't wake them up!
-That's a myth!

1096
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,290
-Wake up, both of you.
-Don't.

1097
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,961
I told you! I told you!

1098
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:21,256
Stop it! Don't hurt him!

1099
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:36,813
--grant me this one,
because I was pretty wasted.

1100
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,107
So I put my lips
around that breathalyzer...

1101
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:41,568
...and I saw those numerals pop up:

1102
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:46,531
0.079.

1103
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:51,077
So I started going to Chad
Michael Murray's Christmas party.

1104
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,330
I think that was the year.
And just driving--

1105
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:57,083
I have to interrupt you. Robert, while
the children are in the living room...

1106
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,128
...I think this would be a good time
to make our announcement.

1107
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:03,214
-What's going on?
-It's over.

1108
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,718
I'm gonna be moving in
with my friend Jack Handle...

1109
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:09,387
...and Nancy found a townhouse
in the city.

1110
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,265
What is this? What's happening?

1111
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:15,852
What Robert is trying to say
is that we are getting a divorce.

1112
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,938
-Don't do this.
-No. No!

1113
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,815
-I could've called this one.
-No.

1114
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,817
-Yeah.
-Is it our fault?

1115
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:25,028
-Is it because we were bad?
-No. No.

1116
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:28,198
The main thing that
Robert and I talked about...

1117
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:30,950
...is that we did not want you two
to blame yourselves.

1118
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:34,496
-What can we do to fix it?
-Dale, honey, are you okay?

1119
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:37,540
-Why are you calling him "honey"?
-I cannot stress this enough:

1120
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:41,336
-It is not your fault.
-Whose fault is it?

1121
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:43,880
-Fuck it, I wanna fucking know!
-Let's cut the shit.

1122
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:47,675
-It is directly your fault.
-Robert.

1123
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:49,302
You destroyed my boat.

1124
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:51,012
You beat me up in your sleep...

1125
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:55,225
...and worst of all, you made
Nancy and I resent each other.

1126
01:04:55,392 --> 01:05:00,105
-It is absolutely 150 percent your fault!
-Of course it's their fault.

1127
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,691
They're the world's biggest dickheads,
and they're living in your house.

1128
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:06,403
-Shut up, Derek.
-I'm sorry, but that--

1129
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:10,782
Please don't cry like that.
Please don't, Brennan.

1130
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:18,665
-Mommy!
-Dale!

1131
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,709
I told you that they would feel
completely to blame.

1132
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:25,630
-Oh, let's grow up.
-I think I'm going to throw up.

1133
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:28,216
-I think I'm gonna throw up...
-Don't throw up.

1134
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:31,261
...all the nice dinner that I had.
I'm gonna throw it up.

1135
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:34,722
-You're not gonna throw up.
-He's gonna throw up.

1136
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,601
-Come on.
-My God, he threw up. Oh, this is ugly.

1137
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,854
-Hey, guys. Guys.
-This is not nice!

1138
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,982
-All right, dipshits. Right here.
-Stop it, Derek.

1139
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:49,362
-One, two, three....
-I don't want my picture taken now.

1140
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:58,580
Good luck, and remember, I need you
out of this house by tomorrow.

1141
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,915
No exceptions.

1142
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:12,343
If there's anything you need,
anything that you boys need...

1143
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:15,221
...you just give me a call. Okay?
It's all right.

1144
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:25,106
Hey. Are you awake?

1145
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,108
Yeah.

1146
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:33,323
I can't believe we actually
have to move out of this house.

1147
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,326
I know. I feel bad.

1148
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:39,120
Hey, you know,
we don't have to whisper anymore.

1149
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:40,663
Mom and Dad aren't here.

1150
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,874
Yeah, but can we keep
doing it, though?

1151
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:45,210
It helps me pretend that they are.

1152
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:48,213
You must feel just terrible.

1153
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:52,133
-I mean, I know I feel bad.
-Yeah.

1154
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,636
But I can't imagine how you feel...

1155
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:57,722
...after my dad looked
right at you and said...

1156
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:00,350
...it's all your fault
that they broke up.

1157
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:04,395
That's funny, because my mom said:

1158
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,981
"If that curly-headed fuck Dale
wasn't here...

1159
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,609
...everything would be perfect."

1160
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:13,655
-You take that back.
-No way. It's your fault.

1161
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,823
You know what your problem is?

1162
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,743
You live in a fantasy land.
You refuse to get a job...

1163
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:21,621
...and you don't know what it's like
to work for something.

1164
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:25,375
You don't take responsibility for
your actions. This is all your fault!

1165
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:28,628
Well, you're a mama's boy
who's too chicken to sing in public!

1166
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:31,965
Yeah, that's right.

1167
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,425
Run away, little boy,
because you know it's true.

1168
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,177
Just avoid everything.

1169
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:39,180
What are you doing?

1170
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:42,976
-Dale broke up Mom and Dad
-Motherfucker!

1171
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:46,938
Dale broke up Mom and Dad
Dale broke up Mom and Dad

1172
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:48,982
-Dale broke up Mom and--
-Brennan!

1173
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:57,949
Get up, Brennan,
I know you're faking. Get up!

1174
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,909
Get up!

1175
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:07,208
Brennan?

1176
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:10,712
It's just like Cold Case Files.
It's just like Cold Case Files.

1177
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:12,755
It's just like Cold Case Files.

1178
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:15,425
People die every day.

1179
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,929
Give him a proper burial
in an unmarked grave....

1180
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:26,561
-Brennan! You're alive! Oh, my God.
-I know.

1181
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:28,062
I'm alive.

1182
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:34,319
-You were dead. I saw you die!
-I was faking.

1183
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:36,946
I used ninja focus
to slow my heart rate down.

1184
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:40,199
-What are you doing?
-I'm burying you.

1185
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:43,828
-I'm alive. Brennan, I'm alive.
-You're waking the neighbors!

1186
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:46,289
-Shut up!
-No. No.

1187
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:50,376
-Now I'm gonna play your drum set.
-Help me.

1188
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:53,338
Close your eyes.
Let the dirt just shower over you.

1189
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:56,591
This is your fault.

1190
01:08:57,175 --> 01:09:01,679
Oh, I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna sleep good tonight.

1191
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:06,976
-Don't you touch my drums!
-Zombie!

1192
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:10,313
Zombie! Zombie!

1193
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:13,149
Get off me, zombie.

1194
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,319
Get off.

1195
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:29,999
I'm late for school.

1196
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:33,711
I will kiss you right on the mouth,
Kenny Rogers.

1197
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:37,256
-Just get off me.
-Hey.

1198
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:42,345
So I guess it's really over.

1199
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:45,390
I'd say you trying to bury me alive
pretty much did it.

1200
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,809
You know what I just realized?

1201
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:50,144
You've been the one
dragging me down.

1202
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:53,398
Now I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna
get a job and an apartment...

1203
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:56,526
...and then I'm gonna get Mom
and Dr. Doback back together.

1204
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:59,445
I'm gonna be the hero,
and you can suck on it.

1205
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:05,576
My life was perfect
before you came here.

1206
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:09,789
Me and my dad had a perfect setup,
and you wrecked it.

1207
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:14,669
Hey.

1208
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,755
We're no longer brothers.

1209
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:21,926
We never were.
We were stepbrothers.

1210
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:37,400
-That was one of your best.
-These balls fucking suck.

1211
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:39,694
All right.

1212
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,363
Well, well, well,
look who's here, boys.

1213
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:45,491
Can you give me a job, please?

1214
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:49,871
TJ, get an office pool going.

1215
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:52,999
Give Ken-Doll Crotch here
two weeks, tops.

1216
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,960
Dr. Angel Face,
I just wanted to say thank you...

1217
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:59,839
...for meeting me
on such short notice.

1218
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:02,341
-Don't call me Angel Face.
-I apologize.

1219
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:07,180
I'm very alone right now, and the thing
I wanna ask you to help me--

1220
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,433
To show me how I can be
a grownup.

1221
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,643
Do I carry my
high-school diploma around?

1222
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,228
What do you do with your hair?

1223
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,522
What happens if there's
inclement weather?

1224
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:18,357
Where do you--?
What do you wear?

1225
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:20,318
Can you wash clothes
in the dishwasher?

1226
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:23,446
I notice that there's a long gap
in your job history...

1227
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:27,408
...and it said for 22 years...

1228
01:11:27,575 --> 01:11:30,703
...you went Kerouac
on everyone's ass?

1229
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,122
I'm gonna be honest with you.
I really need a job.

1230
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:36,459
And I will take any position,
as long as it doesn't involve...

1231
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:40,671
...having sex with old ladies
for money or bear traps.

1232
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:43,424
-Those are my two bugaboos.
-All right, got it.

1233
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:46,344
There's a catering business,
there's a temp job open.

1234
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:48,971
And you get to play with fire.

1235
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,629
What do you want?
This is my online-poker time.

1236
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,090
I'm ready to take on
the Catalina Wine Mixer.

1237
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:08,175
Slow down there, Speed Racer.

1238
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:10,678
I know what it entails,
and I'm ready to nail it.

1239
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:13,389
I want it, okay?
I want the Catalina Wine Mixer.

1240
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,349
-Yo, yo.
-Hey, D-man.

1241
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,184
-You tell him what's up?
-I sure did.

1242
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,895
-Hey.
-Hey.

1243
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,522
Your brother wants a shot
at the Catalina Wine Mixer.

1244
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:22,857
I'm ready, walking tall.

1245
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:24,734
You're ready to run with the bulls?

1246
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:28,821
I've been earning and burning,
snapping necks and cashing checks.

1247
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,908
Screw it, let's let him do it.
It's a win-win for me...

1248
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,327
-...because if you fuck up, Brennan...
-Yeah?

1249
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:38,664
...I get to fire your ass. But if you pull
it off, I look like a genius to the board.

1250
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:41,000
-Okay?
-I get it.

1251
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:42,460
Brennan, here's the thing.

1252
01:13:42,627 --> 01:13:45,463
It's the Catalina fucking
Wine Mixer, okay?

1253
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:47,798
Are you saying "pow"?
What are you saying?

1254
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:51,719
It's the biggest helicopter-leasing
event in the Western Hemisphere...

1255
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:53,930
...since 1997.

1256
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,058
-Why does he keep doing that?
-I have to sell or lease...

1257
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:59,352
...at least 80 choppers
to make my nut.

1258
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:04,190
And you mess with my nut, Brennan,
Randy here is gonna eat your dick.

1259
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:06,859
Like Kobayashi.

1260
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:09,737
I've seen him do it.

1261
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:11,364
You've seen him eat a penis?

1262
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:14,408
It was in international waters,
so they couldn't prosecute him.

1263
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:17,078
I tell you now, I'll nail it.
I'll pull it off, okay?

1264
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:19,246
Wait a second,
why do you want this so bad?

1265
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:21,916
Trying to get Mom and Dad
back together or something?

1266
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:23,292
-Why do I want this?
-Yeah.

1267
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:28,339
Because I wanna make bank, bro.
I wanna get ass.

1268
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:30,257
And I wanna drive a Range Rover.

1269
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:31,926
Okay, well, you better, Brennan.

1270
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:34,178
This is the fucking
Catalina Wine Mixer.

1271
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,573
Nancy. Hi.

1272
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:58,244
Hi. What are you doing here?

1273
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:00,329
Well, Dale's working the function.

1274
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:03,374
Guys, this is supposed to be jicama,
not bok choy.

1275
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:04,583
Sorry, folks.

1276
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,337
And I got an invitation from Brennan.

1277
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:11,632
Can you believe
Brennan put all this together?

1278
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,971
And now here we all are in Catalina.

1279
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:20,808
-It's funny, huh?
-Yeah, it's funny.

1280
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:23,310
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Hey.

1281
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:26,605
Not bad. You're nailing it.

1282
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,983
-Thanks, Randy. That means a lot.
-Yeah.

1283
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,359
I don't know what it is...

1284
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:33,362
...but I wanna deliver one of these
right in your suck hole.

1285
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,657
-Is there anything I can do?
-No. Not really. It's your face.

1286
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:39,368
Again, you're doing great, man.
The Catalina Wine Mixer.

1287
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,454
We're all having a great time,
having fun.

1288
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,165
You pulled it off.
But if you don't change your face...

1289
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:46,459
-...I'm gonna change it for you.
-Okay. Okay.

1290
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,753
All I can do is take that in,
consider it...

1291
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:52,173
...and I'll just do my best version
of whatever I think that would be.

1292
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:55,134
I don't even hear you,
your face is driving me nuts.

1293
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,344
-Thanks again, though.
-Oh, tits. Hold on.

1294
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:01,182
Hey. Hello, Catalina Wine Mixer.

1295
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:03,851
How are you? We are Uptown Girl.

1296
01:16:04,018 --> 01:16:07,855
We are California's pre-eminent
1980s Billy Joel cover band.

1297
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:09,774
"Piano Man"!

1298
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,859
What did I just say, man?

1299
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:13,819
All right, we don't play that...

1300
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,530
...so let's keep it in the '80s
and let's keep it fun.

1301
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:17,823
You having a good time?

1302
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,367
I hope you are,
because sometimes life can be tough.

1303
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:25,581
And I know that sometimes
it's hard to "Keeping the Faith."

1304
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:37,927
You guys seem to be hitting it off.

1305
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:39,386
Oh, honey.

1306
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:41,472
Oh, my God,
this is the greatest party.

1307
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:42,848
-Hello, Robert.
-Way to go.

1308
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:45,559
-Brennan, this is fantastic.
-Way to go.

1309
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:47,478
So impressed.

1310
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:49,688
-Hi, Dad. Hi, Nancy.
-Hi, Dale.

1311
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,565
-Hey, Brennan.
-It's good to see you.

1312
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:53,901
Thanks for hiring
our catering company.

1313
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:56,946
Easy decision. You guys have
a outstanding track record.

1314
01:16:57,571 --> 01:17:00,282
-Just like old times, huh?
-Right, it really is.

1315
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,326
You still have your
night-vision goggles?

1316
01:17:02,493 --> 01:17:06,413
No, no. No, I had to sell those
to pay for car insurance.

1317
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:08,916
How about you?
You still breaking boards...

1318
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:11,085
...or kicking holes in pumpkins
or anything?

1319
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:12,837
No.

1320
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:16,757
But I did start taking baby aspirin
to reduce my risk for heart attack.

1321
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:19,760
That makes sense.
Gotta keep an eye on it, you know.

1322
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:22,930
-Knock off the sweets.
-Thank you.

1323
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:30,271
It's a truly funny observation.

1324
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:31,647
Yeah.

1325
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:34,316
Dale, the empanadas
are starting to sweat.

1326
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,652
Okay. I better run.

1327
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:38,696
-It's good to see you, Brennan.
-You too.

1328
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:41,991
-Take care, be well. Take care, Dad.
-Okay, buddy.

1329
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:44,577
-It's great to talk to him.
-Yeah.

1330
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:46,453
I gotta go too.

1331
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,790
We should do this again.
I think it was very constructive.

1332
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:56,338
-Maybe grab a bite to eat?
-Sure.

1333
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,299
-Go to Outback Steakhouse.
-Okay.

1334
01:17:58,465 --> 01:18:00,134
I've grown very fond of that place.

1335
01:18:01,552 --> 01:18:03,470
Thank you for coming.

1336
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:05,389
Great to see you.

1337
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:09,310
It was very nice to see you, Robert.

1338
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:15,274
I think Brennan organized this
whole thing to get us back together.

1339
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:21,864
You have to excuse me.
I think that I just might cry.

1340
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:25,618
It's the funniest thing. Bye-bye.

1341
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,999
"Start the Fire," buddy!

1342
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:35,753
Come on, man. Play something
from The Stranger!

1343
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:38,756
We strictly do '80s Joel music, sir.

1344
01:18:42,009 --> 01:18:44,011
'80s Billy Joel doo-wop sucks!

1345
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:46,722
Hey, listen, motherfucker,
we only sing '80s Joel!

1346
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,683
So take your skank hooker wife
and get the fuck out of here!

1347
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:52,686
Shit.

1348
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:54,897
-What's wrong?
-All right. "What's wrong?"

1349
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:57,274
Get him out of here.
Get his ass out of here!

1350
01:18:57,524 --> 01:18:58,734
Hey.

1351
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:02,529
Hey, great job, fuck face. You just
busted my nut. This party's shot.

1352
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:05,241
Just relax. I didn't realize
he would say these things.

1353
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:07,201
You know what?
You cost me money.

1354
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:09,870
So this isn't even
a judgment call, man.

1355
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:12,915
-You're Audi 5000, my friend.
-Derek, can't we talk about this?

1356
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:14,250
No.

1357
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,210
-Hey.
-Shit.

1358
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:19,213
-Is everything okay?
-No. He just fired me.

1359
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:20,631
What happened to the music?

1360
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:23,550
The band left. The guy freaked out.

1361
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:24,885
Derek fired me.

1362
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:27,346
-It's no big deal.
-Robert, you don't get it.

1363
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:29,056
It's the Catalina Wine Mixer!

1364
01:19:29,223 --> 01:19:31,475
People have killed
to be in the position I'm in.

1365
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:33,894
-He's right. It's a big deal.
-Here's a thought:

1366
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:36,647
I see an empty stage.

1367
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:39,566
I see drums, I see a drummer.

1368
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:42,111
I see a microphone,
and I see a singer.

1369
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:43,737
-Dad, come on.
-What?

1370
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:45,823
-We gave that stuff up.
-We don't do that.

1371
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:48,450
Listen to me.
Dale, look, when I was a kid...

1372
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:51,745
...when I was a little boy,
I always wanted to be a dinosaur.

1373
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:54,665
I wanted to be a Tyrannosaurus rex
more than anything.

1374
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:57,793
I made my arms short
and I roamed the backyard...

1375
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:01,588
...and I chased the neighborhood cats,
and I growled and I roared.

1376
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:03,590
Everybody knew me
and was afraid of me.

1377
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,259
And then one day, my dad said:

1378
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:09,305
"Bobby, you're 17. It's time
to throw childish things aside."

1379
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,556
And I said, "Okay, Pop."

1380
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:14,685
But he didn't really say that, he said,
"Stop being a dinosaur and get a job."

1381
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:18,230
But, you know, I thought to myself,
"I'll go to medical school...

1382
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:21,608
...I'll practice for a little while,
and then I'll come back to it."

1383
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,694
-Dad--
-How is that a skill?

1384
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:25,446
But I forgot how to do it.

1385
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:26,822
You're human.

1386
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:29,199
-You could never be a dinosaur.
-Yeah.

1387
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:32,953
Hey, I lost it.

1388
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,122
-Dad, what's the point?
-Yeah.

1389
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:38,083
The point is
don't lose your dinosaur.

1390
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:41,378
Yeah. You know, I hated
the way you guys were before.

1391
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:42,796
I mean, I hated you.

1392
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:47,718
But it just kills me to see you
so crushed and normal.

1393
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:49,720
Listen to me, don't listen to me...

1394
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:53,140
...Prestige Worldwide,
that's what you gotta do.

1395
01:20:53,307 --> 01:20:56,602
-You're saying we should go for it.
-That's what I'm saying.

1396
01:20:57,311 --> 01:20:58,979
What do you think, Brennan?

1397
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:01,607
I'm so scared right now.
I'm gonna do what's sensible:

1398
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,359
I'm gonna file for unemployment...

1399
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:06,320
...and I'm gonna try to get a job
at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

1400
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:09,323
Because they got
a excellent corporate structure...

1401
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:12,493
...and they give you the tools
to be your own boss.

1402
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:14,536
My dad's right.

1403
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:16,246
This isn't me.

1404
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:19,583
I'm fucking miserable.
I had to get up at 10:00 this morning.

1405
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:23,587
And even though
I just got a tidal wave of nerves...

1406
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:25,464
...I'm going up on that stage...

1407
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:28,175
...and I'm gonna make beautiful music
for a sad world.

1408
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:30,677
-Dale....
-That's the boy I know.

1409
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:32,930
This crowd's gonna eat him alive.

1410
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,683
Wait, what's he doing up there?

1411
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:39,228
Somebody get him
off the fucking stage!

1412
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:41,522
Hi. How you doing?

1413
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:45,025
My name's Dale Doback,
and I hope you like to kick it.

1414
01:21:45,192 --> 01:21:46,944
Oh, go get them, Dale!

1415
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:49,446
Boats and ho's

1416
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:51,490
Get off the stage, you dick!

1417
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:53,409
Stop yelling at him.

1418
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:57,162
-Terrible!
-Terrible.

1419
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:58,705
He's a human being.

1420
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:03,210
Dale has a mangina
Dale has a mangina

1421
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:04,503
No.

1422
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,797
Gotta have me my boats and ho's

1423
01:22:06,964 --> 01:22:09,341
He's up there alone, Brennan.
He's up there alone.

1424
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:13,887
Gotta have me my boats and ho's

1425
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:15,889
-You suck!
-What are you doing, Brennan?

1426
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:17,141
Gotta have me my....

1427
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:19,560
Brennan, no!

1428
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:22,229
-What did you do?
-Oh, Jesus, Nancy.

1429
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:24,815
I couldn't stand to see him like that.
I miss my son.

1430
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:29,486
All right. Let me go for a few bars.
Come in soft, but then finish strong.

1431
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:31,613
-Okay. Hey, Brennan?
-Yeah.

1432
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,867
-Thanks for coming up.
-You got it, Dragon.

1433
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:36,869
We got a little change coming up.

1434
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:39,413
It's my main man Brennan.

1435
01:23:35,802 --> 01:23:37,137
Boats and ho's

1436
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:57,157
Boats and ho's

1437
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:47,791
-You did it, Derek.
-I made a kite fly.

1438
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:51,461
Brennan, you're the best
big brother ever!

1439
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:03,807
--floor mats. The ones that match
the seats, and I kind of wanted--

1440
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:06,435
I traveled 500 miles
to give you my seed.

1441
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:08,812
Lumberjack!

1442
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:51,438
Rock the fuck
out of those drums, Dale!

1443
01:25:51,605 --> 01:25:52,898
I'm sorry.

1444
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:36,983
-We're Prestige Worldwide!
-Prestige Worldwide!

1445
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:41,154
-Fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.
-It's the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.

1446
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:44,199
It's the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.

1447
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:45,909
Brennan, that was sublime.

1448
01:26:46,076 --> 01:26:48,370
Amazing.
We are so proud of you both.

1449
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,080
-Thank you.
-Incredible.

1450
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:51,415
-Thank you so much.
-Hey.

1451
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:55,502
So I made my quota.
Yeah, we sold a shit-ton of copters.

1452
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:57,754
-That's so good.
-Yeah.

1453
01:26:57,921 --> 01:27:01,383
Look, I'm not great at
this Hallmark stuff...

1454
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,885
...but, Brennan,
when I look at you now...

1455
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,471
...I don't wanna kick you
in the head quite as much.

1456
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:09,266
Thanks, man.

1457
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:10,976
-That was beautiful.
-That was nice.

1458
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:12,519
Yeah.

1459
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:15,689
-What do we do now?
-We could hug.

1460
01:27:15,856 --> 01:27:17,941
Yeah, you'd like that, faggot.
Sorry. I'm--

1461
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:22,279
Okay.

1462
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:36,877
-It's okay.
-Okay.

1463
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:53,727
-That's what we've been looking for.
-That's the ticket.

1464
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:55,395
It's fantastic.

1465
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:59,024
We've never done anything like that,
so you can't expect it to be perfect.

1466
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:00,233
It was good.

1467
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,152
-Felt good.
-Gotten close to a hug.

1468
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:06,531
-Hello, Brennan. Hi.
-Denise. Hey.

1469
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:09,451
Robert, Mom, Derek,
this is my girlfriend, Denise.

1470
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:12,746
-Hi. How are you?
-Actually, I'm his therapist.

1471
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:15,916
-We are in absolutely no way dating.
-Right.

1472
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:19,920
Brennan told me he was going to
hurl his body off a helicopter...

1473
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:22,255
...into shark-infested waters...

1474
01:28:22,422 --> 01:28:24,841
...so I had a legal obligation
to be here.

1475
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:26,176
I get it.

1476
01:28:26,343 --> 01:28:30,305
Don't wanna appear too eager,
and that is a good strategy too.

1477
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:32,516
You are an enabler.
You think you're helping...

1478
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:34,518
-...but you're not.
-And you are a keeper.

1479
01:28:34,684 --> 01:28:36,478
What'd you think?

1480
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:41,775
Brennan, I thought
you were incredibly brave.

1481
01:28:41,942 --> 01:28:42,984
And I mean that...

1482
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:46,446
...in strictly the most clinical
and professional sense possible...

1483
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:50,075
...with no emotional,
intimate, sexual...

1484
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:52,869
...or any other undertones
that you could possibly infer.

1485
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:55,789
God, you're gonna make me cry.

1486
01:28:56,373 --> 01:28:59,960
What poem is that from?
Is that James Joyce?

1487
01:29:00,126 --> 01:29:01,795
Alice...

1488
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:04,798
-...I like making sex with you.
-Yeah.

1489
01:29:04,965 --> 01:29:08,718
I do. But you're also married.

1490
01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:10,804
It's over.

1491
01:29:11,805 --> 01:29:13,181
This is crazy. I'm a mother.

1492
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:16,059
I have two children,
I have a husband, a beautiful home.

1493
01:29:16,226 --> 01:29:19,354
-I can't be fucking around with you.
-It was fun. It was fun, right?

1494
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:22,816
-It was fun while it lasted.
-I'm glad. All right, well, good luck.

1495
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:28,864
-No.
-Oh, my God, Dale!

1496
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:32,033
-Please don't leave me.
-Oh, my God. Look at that whale.

1497
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,743
Where?

1498
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:38,290
Dale!

1499
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:45,463
So I was with Seal...

1500
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:49,092
...and we were just taking a chopper
up to Everest base camp...

1501
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:51,428
-...and the plot to my Sherpa--
-Derek. Derek.

1502
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:54,431
-Sorry. Okay.
-Remember, we talked about this.

1503
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:57,517
Dale, Brennan.
Tell me about the karaoke business.

1504
01:29:57,851 --> 01:30:00,687
Really great, Dad.
Yeah. We call it Karaoke 'n' Roll.

1505
01:30:01,395 --> 01:30:04,441
We got six bars, three restaurants,
and two more wanna sign up.

1506
01:30:04,608 --> 01:30:06,610
-So it's booming.
-Fantastic.

1507
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:08,528
Most karaoke it's,
"Open to everyone.

1508
01:30:08,695 --> 01:30:10,906
-Hey, just get up and have fun."
-Not you guys.

1509
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,407
If you can't sing, just sit down.
That's our motto.

1510
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:16,202
-It's the big leagues.
-You guys are doing so great.

1511
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:20,414
Guys, I have a little Christmas
surprise for Dale and Brennan.

1512
01:30:21,415 --> 01:30:22,959
-You wanna see it?
-Yes!

1513
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:25,545
-You bet!
-Let's go look at it! Come on.

1514
01:30:25,712 --> 01:30:27,297
-Don't peek.
-I smell cookies.

1515
01:30:27,464 --> 01:30:29,341
Be patient. No, no. No, no.

1516
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:33,553
-Just a piñata, isn't it?
-Be patient. Be patient.

1517
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,597
-Be patient.
-Did you get me a tiger, Dad?

1518
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:36,848
Okay, open your eyes.

1519
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:38,266
Merry Christmas.

1520
01:30:38,432 --> 01:30:40,101
Holy shit!

1521
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,772
Dad, I can't believe
you put the boat in the tree!

1522
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:45,065
This is amazing!

1523
01:30:46,232 --> 01:30:49,569
-It's The Gilded Lady. She lives!
-I can't believe it.

1524
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:53,865
-How'd you get it up here?
-Oh, Robert, it's so great.

1525
01:30:54,366 --> 01:30:56,242
-Pirate hats!
-Pirate hats!

1526
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:01,331
-Hustlers!
-Hustlers!

1527
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:03,708
Dad, that was so thoughtful!

1528
01:31:05,835 --> 01:31:08,546
-Crossbows!
-Crossbows!

1529
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:11,633
You guys finally came to your senses
and got us something cool.

1530
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:14,260
You both know this is
completely fucked up, right?

1531
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:15,929
-Yeah.
-Of course.

1532
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:20,058
But Brennan sure can wear the shit
out of that pirate hat.

1533
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:23,103
-Chewbacca masks!
-Chewbacca masks!

1534
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:29,818
It's okay that mine's
not movie-quality.

1535
01:31:55,885 --> 01:31:59,305
But he's like, "No, because you drove
my car last week, so I can't get it."

1536
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:03,476
So I'm like "You're gonna buy it for me
or I'm gonna sock you in the mouth."

1537
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:13,945
Oh, shit.

1538
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:23,413
Well, if it isn't Dale Doback
and his little butt buddy.

1539
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,623
Sticks and stones
may break my bones...

1540
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:29,294
...but I'm gonna kick you repeatedly
in the balls, Gardocki!

1541
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:31,838
Let's get them!

1542
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:22,596
The cops'll be here soon.

1543
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:26,017
I guess this is what it feels like
to be grown up.

1544
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:27,685
Hey.

1545
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:29,938
Can I ask you something?

1546
01:33:30,105 --> 01:33:31,564
Yeah, of course.

1547
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:33,483
You know back when
you first moved in?

1548
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:34,692
Yeah.

1549
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:37,445
-Did you touch my drum set?
-No, I didn't.

1550
01:33:37,611 --> 01:33:39,739
No, really, I won't get mad.
I just wanna know.

1551
01:33:39,906 --> 01:33:41,825
No, I know.
You said you wouldn't get mad.

1552
01:33:41,991 --> 01:33:44,702
I'm saying I didn't do it.
I didn't do it, I never did it.

1553
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:46,704
-Then I owe you an apology.
-No.

1554
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:48,498
No, you don't, at all. No.

1555
01:33:48,665 --> 01:33:51,126
Why wouldn't you take an apology
if you didn't do it?

1556
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:54,129
Just because I'm cool.
It doesn't matter.

1557
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:36,267
You got my passport.

1558
01:37:37,393 --> 01:37:38,436
I'm good.

1559
01:37:42,231 --> 01:37:45,193
Don't worry, not gonna be late.
Don't worry.
