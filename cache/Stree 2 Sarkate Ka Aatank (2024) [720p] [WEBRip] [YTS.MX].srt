00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:08,051
Attention everyone!

4
00:06:08,926 --> 00:06:14,385
The Mahapooja
festivities begin today.

5
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,510
The veneration of the Mahapooja

6
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:20,676
will be carried out by female devotees,

7
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,301
as it was done last time.

8
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,635
And the men are requested

9
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,343
to use a rattle

10
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:30,510
to entertain themselves
as well as the children.

11
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:36,760
All the women are requested

12
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,885
to wear red saris

13
00:06:39,968 --> 00:06:42,343
and assemble in the temple courtyard.

14
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:47,760
"She'd visit during the grand
veneration festivities, it's true,"

15
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:49,301
"Go for it, DJ!"

16
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:56,176
"She'd visit during the grand
veneration festivities, it's true,"

17
00:06:56,676 --> 00:07:00,843
"Yeah, she'd visit during the grand
veneration festivities, it's true,"

18
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:05,968
"In the lonely streets,"

19
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:10,301
"In the lonely streets,"

20
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:13,760
"She'd call out to men from behind."

21
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:18,051
"Yeah, she'd visit during the grand
veneration festivities, it's true,"

22
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:23,718
"With her voice so mesmerizing,
she'd steal their hearts,"

23
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:26,718
"Yeah, she'd visit during the grand
veneration festivities, it's true,"

24
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:27,968
"And, and, and..."

25
00:07:28,051 --> 00:07:32,718
"And if anyone dared
to turn around and look,"

26
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:35,010
"She would strip him bare,"

27
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:36,926
- Oh no!
- Oh God! - What are you saying?

28
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,635
"She would strip him bare,
And take him away fast."

29
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,718
"She'd visit during the grand
veneration festivities, it's true,"

30
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:50,718
"So in Chanderi,
the men used to not step out of the house,"

31
00:07:50,801 --> 00:07:52,176
"English lyrics, huh?"

32
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,760
"Brother Rudra!"

33
00:07:53,843 --> 00:07:59,093
"And those who went out,
they dressed in a sari and blouse."

34
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:04,885
"It was hard to get rid of Stree,"

35
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:09,843
"That's why everyone
wrote outside their homes -"

36
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:12,510
"O Stree, come tomorrow,"

37
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:16,093
"O Stree, come tomorrow,"

38
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,968
"O Stree, come tomorrow,"

39
00:08:20,051 --> 00:08:21,260
"No, don't come today,"

40
00:08:21,343 --> 00:08:24,093
"O Stree, come tomorrow,"

41
00:08:24,926 --> 00:08:28,343
"Then came the protector of Chanderi,
mighty and bold,"

42
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:31,843
"He risked it all, made his move,"

43
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:35,010
"He looked into Stree's eyes,
with affection so true,"

44
00:08:35,093 --> 00:08:35,926
"With love..."

45
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,843
"Stree's strength was in her braid,"

46
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:39,843
In her braid!

47
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:42,510
And the protector chopped it off too,"

48
00:08:42,593 --> 00:08:43,426
"Chopped off!"

49
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,926
"He chopped off that braid
and saved all the men,"

50
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,718
"And gave Stree - "

51
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:53,093
"The love and respect she deserved."

52
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,218
"The love and respect she deserved."

53
00:08:57,926 --> 00:09:00,010
"The love and respect she deserved."

54
00:09:01,301 --> 00:09:04,051
"The love and respect she deserved."

55
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,510
Brother Rudra?

56
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:16,093
Looks like someone had a little
too much to drink last night, hmm?

57
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:17,510
Barfing and all?

58
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:20,218
Knowledge.

59
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:22,093
Just getting some knowledge out
of my system.

60
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:25,055
You know, when you've got too much knowledge it overflows,
you've got to find a way to let it all out.

61
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:26,468
What brings you here?

62
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:28,051
Oh, I just came by to drop off
this old letter for you.

63
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:29,551
I found it
when I was cleaning up the place.

64
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,968
Wow, that's pretty quick service, Postman.

65
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:32,010
A letter that was received
during the Pooja,

66
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:33,801
is being delivered during
the Mahapooja?

67
00:09:33,968 --> 00:09:34,885
Who sent it?

68
00:09:34,968 --> 00:09:37,260
I was kind of curious myself about
who would bother sending you a letter--

69
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:40,093
- Hmm, maybe it's a love letter?
- Why do you say that?

70
00:09:40,176 --> 00:09:43,676
Well, look at it! It's got all these drawings
of red flowers and vines on it.

71
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,968
And there's some writing in Urdu, too.

72
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:47,093
You can't read Urdu, huh?

73
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:48,676
Unknowledgeable man.

74
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:53,801
Private and confidential.

75
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,676
For Mr. Rudra's eyes only.

76
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:57,260
Sounds like it's from Shama.

77
00:09:57,343 --> 00:09:59,885
Come on, open it up, let's take a look!

78
00:10:00,843 --> 00:10:01,968
Why don't you read it?

79
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:03,301
Nah, I can't read Urdu.

80
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:05,468
You shouldn't be reading
other people's love letters anyway.

81
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:06,760
Don't get so excited.

82
00:10:07,135 --> 00:10:08,926
Still delivering letters
in the digital age of emails!

83
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,055
You're going to be out
of a job before you know it, buddy.

84
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:11,260
Better get moving.

85
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,010
That's the trouble with small towns,

86
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:17,013
everyone's nosy and wants
to read everyone else's mail.

87
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:18,260
Trollers.

88
00:10:21,135 --> 00:10:22,218
Huh?

89
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:33,343
Vicky?

90
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,093
Hi.

91
00:10:39,343 --> 00:10:40,343
Vicky!

92
00:10:40,635 --> 00:10:41,843
Hi!

93
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,801
You? Is that really you?

94
00:10:47,885 --> 00:10:49,051
Yep, it's me.

95
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,801
I thought you were just...

96
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:54,051
It's been so long.

97
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:55,926
I've missed you.

98
00:10:56,218 --> 00:10:58,760
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

99
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,093
Right, right, right!

100
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:03,885
You...

101
00:11:06,843 --> 00:11:08,801
You are still wearing the same old dress.

102
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:09,926
Yes.

103
00:11:10,468 --> 00:11:12,051
No worries,
I can make you a new one.

104
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,510
In just 31 minutes flat.

105
00:11:13,926 --> 00:11:15,551
But my measurements have changed.

106
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,301
You can take them again if you want.

107
00:11:19,843 --> 00:11:21,051
Perfect.

108
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:25,885
Nah, I always mess it up
when it comes to you.

109
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:28,218
Alright, then just do it without
a measuring tape.

110
00:11:28,718 --> 00:11:30,176
- Can I really do that?
- Go for it.

111
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,885
Okay, I'll give that a shot then.

112
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:57,676
Did you have a little shot
of rum before coming here?

113
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,301
I've never seen you...

114
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,093
Can you see me now?

115
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:05,010
Or do you need another smack
to wake you up?

116
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:09,760
Getting a little handsy there
to take my measurements, huh?

117
00:12:09,843 --> 00:12:11,760
You're trying to stitch me
a new blouse?

118
00:12:12,343 --> 00:12:14,343
You would've kissed me
if I hadn't stopped you.

119
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:16,843
Well, I...

120
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:18,343
What's going on here, Vicky?

121
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:21,968
- So I...
- Oh Chanderi's Forlorn Lover!

122
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:25,051
Keep daydreaming like this
and you'll be curing your own nightfall problems!

123
00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:27,968
You dress up and sit here waiting for her,

124
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:29,510
but she's not coming back.

125
00:12:29,593 --> 00:12:32,218
That unfaithful woman
was just an illusion.

126
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:34,551
- Alright, that's enough, Brother Rudra.
- Yeah, enough already.

127
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:36,055
She vanished into thin air
from a moving bus!

128
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:38,301
I'm telling you, I won't tolerate
you saying a single bad word about her.

129
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,885
Anyway, what brings you here this morning?

130
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:42,926
Why am I here?

131
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,176
Oh right, to show you this.

132
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:47,010
Take a look.

133
00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:50,718
- Chanderi Puran?
- Yep,

134
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,218
some torn pages from the Chanderi Puran.

135
00:12:54,801 --> 00:12:56,926
Someone sent them to me
in the mail a couple of months ago.

136
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,843
The postman just delivered them today.

137
00:12:59,968 --> 00:13:01,718
Stree was a prostitute.

138
00:13:01,801 --> 00:13:03,051
She had a lover.

139
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:05,385
We already knew that part.

140
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:06,885
But we didn't know this.

141
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,801
The letter also included something else.

142
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,176
He is coming back.

143
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,301
Yes.

144
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,885
Who is coming back?

145
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:15,260
That's the million-dollar question,
isn't it?

146
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:17,218
We don't know who exactly is coming back.

147
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,135
- He is coming back?
- We have no idea

148
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:21,885
who tore these pages,

149
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,218
why they did it,

150
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,676
or why they are sending them to me now.

151
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,010
There has to be some secret
agenda behind this.

152
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:31,593
Maybe someone's trying to warn us.

153
00:13:32,176 --> 00:13:33,843
- Brother Rudra?
- Hmm?

154
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:36,093
This chapter is done, okay?

155
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,010
You need to find something better
to do with your time.

156
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:41,926
And do me a favor - brush
your teeth in the mornings.

157
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:43,926
Don't come here smelling like that.

158
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:48,135
He is coming back.

159
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:52,260
Listen, son,

160
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:54,635
have you ever thought about your future?

161
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:57,801
The girls here have become quite modern.

162
00:13:57,885 --> 00:14:00,926
One by one, they're leaving town
and moving to the big cities.

163
00:14:01,593 --> 00:14:02,885
I know, Daddy.

164
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,718
They are doing it for their own good.
So what am I supposed to do?

165
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:09,468
What if there isn't
a single girl left for you?

166
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:11,926
If there aren't any left, then so be it.

167
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:12,843
It doesn't make a difference to me.

168
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:14,055
What are you saying?

169
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:15,635
Of course, it makes a difference to you.

170
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,260
Stop! Listen up.

171
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:21,551
It should make a difference to you!

172
00:14:22,176 --> 00:14:22,968
Have a seat.

173
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:24,843
- I'm running late, Daddy.
- I told you to sit down.

174
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:33,968
Remember I told you a young person's body

175
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:36,260
bustles with vitality?

176
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:38,218
Yeah, like a tank full of energy
or something.

177
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:39,426
Exactly!

178
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:44,843
It's craving to come out, right?

179
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,010
Yeah,
but you taught me to be self-reliant.

180
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:51,343
There's a limit to that as well.

181
00:14:51,926 --> 00:14:53,885
Just get to the point.

182
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:58,218
A virgin oil is healthy,

183
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,385
but a virgin man is not.

184
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,801
You're being too cool about this, Daddy.

185
00:15:01,885 --> 00:15:03,593
- I'm leaving, I'm late.
- Just hear me out.

186
00:15:05,635 --> 00:15:09,051
Do you want to get married or not?

187
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:10,551
I don't want to. So?

188
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:16,260
Then there's only one option left.

189
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:17,510
What?

190
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:21,760
Take this.

191
00:15:23,343 --> 00:15:25,051
Go and do it.

192
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:26,385
Go and do what?

193
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:27,510
Friendship.

194
00:15:28,968 --> 00:15:30,385
- Daddy!
- Yes!

195
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,510
You never know,
perhaps that will bring about a change?

196
00:15:33,593 --> 00:15:35,218
You are committing a sin here.

197
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:36,843
I'm fasting,

198
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:39,343
and you're sitting here
saying these wrong things to me.

199
00:15:39,426 --> 00:15:40,426
There's nothing wrong with it.

200
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,135
- But I'm not like that.
- But...

201
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,843
You keep enjoying your unhealthy habits
in your virgin oil.

202
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:44,885
Hey!

203
00:15:45,468 --> 00:15:46,385
Hey!

204
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:47,760
Look, I know you won't go
for the friendship thing.

205
00:15:47,843 --> 00:15:49,218
So, I'll just keep the cash.

206
00:15:49,301 --> 00:15:50,801
Say thanks to Uncle.

207
00:15:52,593 --> 00:15:53,551
Want a burger?

208
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:54,843
Sure.

209
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:57,635
Nah, I'm fasting.

210
00:15:58,468 --> 00:16:00,510
It's the girls who fast for the boys,
not the other way around!

211
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:01,885
He's fasting, he says!

212
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:03,843
You used to fast until just
a few months ago.

213
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:05,343
I didn't fast for Chitti,

214
00:16:05,426 --> 00:16:06,676
I did it to stay slim and trim.

215
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:08,468
- I see.
- Considering your situation,

216
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,635
I'd suggest you do
the Akshay Ekadashi fast.

217
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,551
Why?

218
00:16:12,635 --> 00:16:16,801
To get freedom from that unrequited
love you have for that witch.

219
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:19,385
Like hell, he's in love!

220
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:22,426
- What?
- That so-called girlfriend of yours,

221
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,343
the one you've bought 40 teddy bears
for in the last four months -

222
00:16:24,426 --> 00:16:25,260
you used my money for that.

223
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,385
- I'm not giving them back.
- Give them back.

224
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:27,013
Nope, not happening.

225
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:27,926
- Give them back.
- I won't.

226
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,260
Give me my money back!

227
00:16:29,426 --> 00:16:30,218
This money is mine.

228
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:31,801
It was your money, but now it's mine.

229
00:16:31,885 --> 00:16:32,843
- I won't give it back.
- Give them back. Hurry up.

230
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,260
Vicky, please.

231
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:36,635
First ask nicely, with some love.

232
00:16:41,426 --> 00:16:42,843
Vicky, please.

233
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:44,635
Is this what you call love?

234
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,593
Hmm.

235
00:16:45,676 --> 00:16:46,760
Forget it.

236
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:49,385
You should beg for it.
That suits you better.

237
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,260
Vicky, pleaseeeee!

238
00:16:53,343 --> 00:16:54,760
I need to buy a gift for Chitti.

239
00:16:54,843 --> 00:16:57,593
- Pleaseeeee!
- Okay, okay, okay.

240
00:16:57,968 --> 00:16:59,135
Alright, alright.

241
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,676
But first, promise
you'll never call her a witch again.

242
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:05,510
I won't, I promise.

243
00:17:06,176 --> 00:17:07,218
Apologize.

244
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:08,093
Sorry.

245
00:17:08,176 --> 00:17:09,426
Apologize to her.

246
00:17:09,843 --> 00:17:10,635
She's here?

247
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,301
Say it from the bottom of your heart,
and she'll hear you.

248
00:17:14,385 --> 00:17:15,426
Okay.

249
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,593
Sorry, witch, I didn't...

250
00:17:18,676 --> 00:17:21,468
Sorry, plain simple sorry.

251
00:17:22,135 --> 00:17:23,135
Thank you.

252
00:17:23,218 --> 00:17:25,343
Now I can get her
a teddy bear this month too.

253
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:31,801
Hey, your little Miss Katrina is here.

254
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:37,635
Bits!

255
00:17:37,843 --> 00:17:38,760
Burger?

256
00:17:38,843 --> 00:17:40,301
- Ugh.
- Ew, man.

257
00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:42,260
- No.
- You'll start bloating up again.

258
00:17:42,343 --> 00:17:43,385
Your tummy will stick out,

259
00:17:43,468 --> 00:17:46,051
and you'll make me stand
in front of you in all the pictures.

260
00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:48,385
Nah, Bits.
The frontal is not my best angle.

261
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,343
No, I wasn't having it.
Brother Vicky was having it.

262
00:17:50,426 --> 00:17:52,260
Remember, I'm doing "intimate" fasting?

263
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:53,426
Hey Vicky!

264
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,176
Yes, it's mine.

265
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,551
How is it going?

266
00:17:56,801 --> 00:17:57,843
Where have you been these days?

267
00:17:57,926 --> 00:17:59,635
Why don't you go come for a jog anymore?

268
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:03,551
Because he's still stuck
in his unrequited love.

269
00:18:03,635 --> 00:18:05,301
Oh no.

270
00:18:06,176 --> 00:18:09,218
Come on, Vicky,
forget about her already.

271
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:10,426
You can have anyone you want.

272
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,010
What?

273
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:15,676
Trust me, you're so handsome and talented.

274
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:17,676
- Aw, come on now...
- Leave Chanderi.

275
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:19,260
Get out of this place.

276
00:18:19,343 --> 00:18:20,551
- Remember my friends...
- Yeah.

277
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:22,385
Shardha, Nikku, and Gauri?

278
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,426
They left the town without
even telling anyone.

279
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,426
Okay.

280
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,510
- You should leave too.
- Leave.

281
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:28,260
You are right.

282
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:31,843
I think you should leave too.

283
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:34,385
What or who do you have here anyway?

284
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:35,551
I'm here!

285
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,510
Ready-made, top-to-toe.

286
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:39,885
And I take such good care of her.

287
00:18:40,135 --> 00:18:41,760
I've brought you your protein shake too.

288
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,426
You can have it.

289
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,635
It's Monday today.

290
00:18:44,926 --> 00:18:46,926
We have to do that tonight, right?

291
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,135
Yes, we do.

292
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,510
- Okay, I'm running late, so...
- Okay.

293
00:18:51,426 --> 00:18:52,510
Bye, Vicky.

294
00:18:52,593 --> 00:18:54,135
- Bye.
- Come for a jog, okay?

295
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:56,260
- Bye, Bits.
- Bye.

296
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,343
Bits.

297
00:18:57,426 --> 00:18:58,968
Short for Bittu.

298
00:18:59,343 --> 00:19:01,051
Thank goodness your name isn't Tittu.

299
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:08,593
"Come down, Come down."

300
00:19:11,635 --> 00:19:13,510
"Come down, Come down."

301
00:19:16,426 --> 00:19:18,301
"Come down, Come down."

302
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:23,260
"Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love..."

303
00:19:23,343 --> 00:19:24,510
"Give it to me, give it to me."

304
00:19:24,593 --> 00:19:30,468
Soft Chitti, warm Chitti,
little ball of fur.

305
00:19:31,135 --> 00:19:36,343
Happy Chitti, sleepy Chitti,
purr purr purr.

306
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,843
- Bits, sing it nicely.
- Yes?

307
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:41,676
Nicely? Okay.

308
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,260
Soft Chitti,

309
00:19:45,343 --> 00:19:47,510
Warm Chitti,

310
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:50,343
Little ball of fur.

311
00:19:50,926 --> 00:19:52,510
Happy Chitti,

312
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:54,343
Sleepy Chitti,

313
00:19:54,468 --> 00:19:56,968
Purr purr purr.

314
00:19:57,468 --> 00:19:58,885
Looks like you're not in the mood for it.

315
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,468
- Nah, I am.
- Nah, it's cool.

316
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:02,051
I'll call Prathamesh.

317
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:03,343
Why would you call him?

318
00:20:03,426 --> 00:20:04,343
He puts me to sleep so nicely.

319
00:20:04,426 --> 00:20:07,010
No need, I'll put you to sleep.
Don't do that.

320
00:20:07,218 --> 00:20:08,510
Alright, I'll sing, I'll sing it well.

321
00:20:10,635 --> 00:20:12,301
Soft Chitti,

322
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:13,635
Warm Chitti,

323
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,510
Little ball of fur.

324
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:20,551
"Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love..."

325
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:25,010
"Give it to me, give it to me.
Give it! Give it! Give it!"

326
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:26,301
Happy Chitti,

327
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:27,760
Sleepy Chitti,

328
00:20:28,968 --> 00:20:30,135
Purr...

329
00:20:31,593 --> 00:20:32,885
Purr...

330
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:42,760
"Come down, Come down."

331
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:51,843
Someone's looking a bit tired, huh?

332
00:20:52,593 --> 00:20:54,635
If you hadn't told me to
"come down, come down",

333
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,260
I wouldn't have come down.

334
00:20:56,343 --> 00:20:57,385
- Really?
- Yeah.

335
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,176
No need to brag.

336
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,551
I know you sang her a lullaby.

337
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,468
She has trouble sleeping.

338
00:21:02,635 --> 00:21:05,551
She can't fall asleep until
I sing her a lullaby.

339
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:09,260
I'm telling you this
because we're friends.

340
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,260
Our body bustles with vitality.

341
00:21:15,426 --> 00:21:16,760
Did you see someone out there?

342
00:21:17,301 --> 00:21:19,218
Let's get going
before someone overhears us.

343
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:20,301
Start the engine!

344
00:22:30,343 --> 00:22:32,093
No!

345
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:35,968
Mummy! Please! Momma!

346
00:22:38,385 --> 00:22:39,885
- Chitti!
- Chitti!

347
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:43,176
Upstairs! I heard her scream upstairs!

348
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,968
- Uncle, we should go upstairs and check on Chitti.
- What happened?

349
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:45,926
What's this commotion about?

350
00:22:47,385 --> 00:22:49,218
- What was that?
- Chitti!

351
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:51,760
Chitti!

352
00:22:53,218 --> 00:22:54,468
Chitti!

353
00:22:54,926 --> 00:22:56,135
Where is Chitti?

354
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:58,510
- Chitti!
- Chitti!

355
00:22:58,593 --> 00:23:00,093
- Where is Chitti!
- Chitti!

356
00:23:00,843 --> 00:23:01,843
What the hell just happened?

357
00:23:01,926 --> 00:23:02,926
Chitti!

358
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,426
The car's trashed too.

359
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,051
- Come on!
- Let's go!

360
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,551
What happened?

361
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:11,176
- That's Bittu!
- Come on, let's go guys.

362
00:23:11,385 --> 00:23:12,468
Who did this?

363
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:13,551
Did anyone see anything?

364
00:23:13,635 --> 00:23:15,426
Did she run off to Delhi?

365
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,760
She didn't need to break
the wall for that.

366
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:17,676
She could've just taken the bus.

367
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:19,593
I've got a bad feeling about this, Vicky.

368
00:23:19,843 --> 00:23:21,385
What happened, Bittu?

369
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:22,926
Did you see anything?

370
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,968
- Let's go downstairs and look for her.
- Yeah. Let's go.

371
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:27,096
O dear lord, I earnestly pray,
please keep the evil away.

372
00:23:27,176 --> 00:23:28,301
Chitti!

373
00:23:28,843 --> 00:23:30,260
- Chitti!
- Hello, Aunty.

374
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:31,593
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

375
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,593
- Chitti's missing.
- Chitti's missing.

376
00:23:34,176 --> 00:23:35,510
- Chitti!
- Chitti!

377
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,385
- Chitti!
- Chitti!

378
00:23:37,676 --> 00:23:39,010
- Chitti!
- Chitti!

379
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:40,551
Brother Rudra?

380
00:23:40,635 --> 00:23:42,051
- Come here.
- Let's go, let's go.

381
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:43,760
- Brother Rudra?
- What are you doing here?

382
00:23:44,218 --> 00:23:45,301
Look at this.

383
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:47,260
It's a huge footprint.

384
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,843
Looks like a Dinosaur's.

385
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:52,343
So a dinosaur kidnapped Chitti?

386
00:23:52,468 --> 00:23:53,676
Come on,

387
00:23:54,551 --> 00:23:57,926
how can a Jurassic creature be
in a place without even a jogger's park?

388
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,218
- You are right. But then...?
- Whose footprint is this?

389
00:24:01,301 --> 00:24:02,635
It...

390
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,385
It belongs to a demon.

391
00:24:06,468 --> 00:24:07,760
A demon?

392
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:10,093
Monster! Ogre! Beast!

393
00:24:11,135 --> 00:24:14,885
Bakasura, Banasura,
Bhasmasur, Narakasura, Talasur...

394
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:18,093
You can find books
on these legendary beings at my store,

395
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,926
with a 5% discount.

396
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,926
Brother Rudra,
can you promote your store later?

397
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,093
First, let's figure
out where Chitti went!

398
00:24:25,176 --> 00:24:26,718
She didn't go anywhere.

399
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,468
He took her.

400
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:31,885
Who?

401
00:24:32,385 --> 00:24:33,468
A headless guy.

402
00:24:35,135 --> 00:24:36,301
He had no head.

403
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,135
I saw him.

404
00:24:39,885 --> 00:24:41,055
He went this way.

405
00:24:41,135 --> 00:24:42,260
Where? Here?

406
00:24:43,135 --> 00:24:44,135
This way?

407
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,135
He took her through the wall.

408
00:24:49,593 --> 00:24:51,135
Shut up, pothead.

409
00:24:51,676 --> 00:24:53,135
Enough of this nonsense.

410
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,051
Don't believe a word this pothead says,

411
00:24:56,135 --> 00:24:57,718
just keep looking for the girl.

412
00:24:57,801 --> 00:24:59,801
I'm sure she's at her friend's place.

413
00:25:01,051 --> 00:25:03,718
Chitti's ice cream printed sock!

414
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:08,051
Chitti!

415
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,055
Chitti!

416
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,843
Why are you yelling
her name like that, huh?

417
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:13,926
Chitti is my love.

418
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,301
If it had been my turn
to help her sleep today,

419
00:25:21,385 --> 00:25:23,343
then I would have saved her.

420
00:26:23,343 --> 00:26:26,426
Vicky...

421
00:26:29,176 --> 00:26:30,426
Ms. Stree?

422
00:26:31,926 --> 00:26:33,801
Ms. Stree? It's me, Vicky.

423
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:38,426
I thought you'd left for good,
but looks like you are back.

424
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,385
Vicky...

425
00:26:41,926 --> 00:26:43,385
Ms. Stree, we...

426
00:26:44,051 --> 00:26:46,593
we're on the same team now, aren't we?

427
00:26:47,426 --> 00:26:49,093
We are friends now.

428
00:26:49,426 --> 00:26:52,010
Sorry about cutting your braid.

429
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,593
Massage your head with warm oil
and it'll grow back in no time.

430
00:26:58,801 --> 00:27:00,551
Ms. Stree, I'm going to turn around now.

431
00:27:00,968 --> 00:27:03,051
Don't take off my clothes, please.

432
00:27:04,176 --> 00:27:05,551
We're friends, remember?

433
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:08,135
Friends.

434
00:27:21,135 --> 00:27:22,760
Ms. Stree?

435
00:27:38,093 --> 00:27:39,801
What's wrong?

436
00:27:40,676 --> 00:27:44,676
Brother Rudra, why did you ditch
that footprint thing and follow me here?

437
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,093
It's me, not your brother Rudra.

438
00:27:49,343 --> 00:27:50,885
You didn't have your daily dose
of rum earlier or what?

439
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:52,010
Vicky, it's me.

440
00:27:52,093 --> 00:27:53,135
Wait a second.

441
00:27:54,218 --> 00:27:55,301
Bittu?

442
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,010
Daddy?

443
00:27:59,676 --> 00:28:00,718
Badri?

444
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:04,426
Whoever you are, just give me
a whack and get this over with.

445
00:28:04,843 --> 00:28:06,218
Wake me up.
Go on, slap me.

446
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,676
Hit me.

447
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,093
Huh?

448
00:28:15,176 --> 00:28:16,176
You...?

449
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:18,760
You...

450
00:28:18,885 --> 00:28:20,135
You're really back!

451
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:21,468
You're really back!

452
00:28:21,593 --> 00:28:22,551
You're really back!

453
00:28:22,718 --> 00:28:23,760
You're back!

454
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,426
You're back!

455
00:28:27,926 --> 00:28:31,301
You're back! You're back! You're back!

456
00:28:33,135 --> 00:28:34,968
I thought about you
from the bottom of my heart.

457
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:36,801
But you took your sweet time to return.

458
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,426
You know the names
they call you behind your back?

459
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,593
What?

460
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,343
They call you an illusion,
a witch, an ogress

461
00:28:44,426 --> 00:28:46,051
and say you're an unfaithful lover
who rejected my love,

462
00:28:46,135 --> 00:28:47,385
and now I'll seek my revenge.

463
00:28:47,718 --> 00:28:49,093
That's not all.

464
00:28:49,176 --> 00:28:50,926
You know what they say about me?

465
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,093
They call me Chanderi's Forlorn Lover,
the Ruined Lover Boy,

466
00:28:53,176 --> 00:28:55,385
Weirdo Vicky, Roadside Romeo,
Love Me No More,

467
00:28:55,468 --> 00:28:58,010
Crazy in Love,
the Latest Loser, Crazy Lover,

468
00:28:58,093 --> 00:28:59,676
the Heartbroken Prince
with unrequited love,

469
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,260
Kabir Singh, the Dry Virgin.

470
00:29:05,135 --> 00:29:06,510
You haven't changed a bit, have you?

471
00:29:06,593 --> 00:29:08,551
And you're still the same too.

472
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,135
Speaking of change,

473
00:29:12,426 --> 00:29:14,301
did you change the bus back then?

474
00:29:15,093 --> 00:29:16,718
The conductor said
you just disappeared from the bus, so...

475
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:18,301
- Everyone has been...
- Can we discuss this stuff later, Vicky?

476
00:29:18,385 --> 00:29:20,760
First,
I need to tell you something important,

477
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:22,885
that's why I got you here alone.

478
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:24,218
Alright, tell me.

479
00:29:24,301 --> 00:29:26,718
I know who took that girl.

480
00:29:28,426 --> 00:29:29,510
Which girl?

481
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:31,510
Chitti?

482
00:29:31,593 --> 00:29:33,051
Not just Chitti,

483
00:29:33,135 --> 00:29:36,551
I know who took all the girls.

484
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:38,301
Who?

485
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:42,510
The one who killed that prostitute
and turned her into Stree.

486
00:29:44,218 --> 00:29:46,343
That's why
he only came back after Stree left.

487
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:48,343
He laid low until now.

488
00:29:50,843 --> 00:29:52,135
Who is that little girl?

489
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,051
Chitti disappeared.

490
00:29:59,135 --> 00:30:00,468
Then Vicky went missing too.

491
00:30:04,343 --> 00:30:05,968
I'll be damned.

492
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:07,301
Brother Rudra,

493
00:30:08,135 --> 00:30:10,135
what if they ran away together?

494
00:30:10,468 --> 00:30:12,093
Never doubt a friend.

495
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:13,885
But look at the timing.

496
00:30:15,593 --> 00:30:17,218
Brother Rudra,
where's the Chithi?

497
00:30:17,801 --> 00:30:19,385
Huh? Chitti is here?

498
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:21,218
No, Chitti's not here.

499
00:30:21,343 --> 00:30:22,218
You had it.

500
00:30:22,343 --> 00:30:23,551
I had Chitti with me?

501
00:30:23,635 --> 00:30:25,010
Yeah, remember you brought
it up to the rooftop.

502
00:30:25,093 --> 00:30:25,926
The rooftop?

503
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,176
Yeah, he brought it there,

504
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,218
opened it, showed it to me,

505
00:30:28,343 --> 00:30:29,385
- and then took it with him.
- What?

506
00:30:29,468 --> 00:30:30,968
Oh, I see.
He's talking about the Chithi.

507
00:30:31,051 --> 00:30:32,176
I'm talking about Chitti too.

508
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,385
And I'm talking about the Chithi.

509
00:30:33,468 --> 00:30:34,885
- No, no...
- Why are you talking about Chitti?

510
00:30:34,968 --> 00:30:35,968
Why wouldn't I talk about the Chithi?

511
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:36,926
Do you have some copyright
over it or what?

512
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,426
Chitti belongs to me,
so of course I'll talk about her.

513
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,510
He's talking about the Chithi.

514
00:30:39,593 --> 00:30:40,426
That's what I'm saying!

515
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,385
- Chitti is mine, why won't I talk about her?
- How can that Chithi belong to you?

516
00:30:42,468 --> 00:30:44,885
- It belongs to him, he has it.
- How can Chitti belong to you?

517
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,385
He's talking about the Chithi!

518
00:30:46,843 --> 00:30:48,510
Chithi - the letter!

519
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:51,260
"You've got mail!"

520
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,218
Letter, mail, correspondence, missive.

521
00:30:53,593 --> 00:30:56,218
And you're talking about
"I'm your fair lady, get me bangles baby!"

522
00:30:56,343 --> 00:30:57,051
Oh, I see.

523
00:30:57,131 --> 00:30:59,176
T-T-I and T-H-I

524
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,926
- Okay, got it.
- Got it.

525
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,135
I had it. I had received it.

526
00:31:02,218 --> 00:31:03,013
- T-T-I and T-H-I
- I see.

527
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:04,135
- Give me a second.
- Okay.

528
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,426
What did you think?

529
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,885
I thought that...

530
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,010
I'm not interested in singing lullabies
to your step-girlfriend.

531
00:31:11,093 --> 00:31:12,055
She's not my step-girlfriend!

532
00:31:12,135 --> 00:31:14,055
I just got too emotional, man!

533
00:31:14,135 --> 00:31:16,093
Alright, don't cry. Don't cry.

534
00:31:17,468 --> 00:31:19,010
This is the Chithi, the letter.

535
00:31:19,093 --> 00:31:21,843
We wouldn't have an issue if you were
more familiar with the Hindi alphabets.

536
00:31:21,968 --> 00:31:25,135
It contains the secret
that will tell us who took Chitti.

537
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:26,468
Then read it quickly.

538
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,510
- May I?
- Brother Rudra,

539
00:31:27,593 --> 00:31:29,093
see what's written in it.

540
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,093
Stree's murderers -

541
00:31:33,843 --> 00:31:36,218
Chandarbhan and the sinful
village council members.

542
00:31:36,843 --> 00:31:38,968
Chandarbhan was the village chief
of Chanderi.

543
00:31:39,051 --> 00:31:41,718
Powerful as a bull, tall as a camel,

544
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:43,260
and proud like Ravana.

545
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,885
He was a womanizer and a drunk.

546
00:31:46,551 --> 00:31:49,010
Though I'd say drinking
isn't always a bad thing.

547
00:31:49,218 --> 00:31:52,260
Some drink to drown their sorrows,
others to forget about ex-lovers.

548
00:31:52,385 --> 00:31:54,885
As long as it's in moderation...

549
00:31:54,968 --> 00:31:56,093
Brother Rudra,
could you please continue reading?

550
00:31:56,176 --> 00:31:57,218
Yes, of course.

551
00:31:57,593 --> 00:31:59,426
Dushashana was his ideal.

552
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:02,010
Disrobing women was his hobby for real.

553
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:06,468
For them, women's duty was to clean up,
keep the family fed,

554
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:09,426
And warm their beds whenever they said.

555
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:13,718
Chandarbhan and his friends loved
to watch a prostitute dance.

556
00:32:13,885 --> 00:32:17,010
When that prostitute tried to tie a knot,

557
00:32:18,093 --> 00:32:22,635
these sinners
first slit her lover's throat

558
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,968
and then right in front
of their little girl,

559
00:32:27,385 --> 00:32:29,593
they burnt both of them at one spot.

560
00:32:30,843 --> 00:32:34,385
Then that prostitute came back as Stree,
no wonder,

561
00:32:36,176 --> 00:32:39,885
and she beheaded Chandarbhan
and his friends

562
00:32:39,968 --> 00:32:42,551
and buried them six feet under.

563
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:45,468
Those headless bodies

564
00:32:46,301 --> 00:32:49,093
still lay buried somewhere.

565
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,093
Oh damn!

566
00:32:52,718 --> 00:32:54,510
Remember the wall at Chitti's place?

567
00:32:55,093 --> 00:32:56,093
Didn't have a head.

568
00:32:56,173 --> 00:32:58,135
Even the pothead said...

569
00:33:00,051 --> 00:33:02,593
What else does it say, Brother Rudra?
Please read.

570
00:33:03,093 --> 00:33:04,468
Give me a minute.

571
00:33:04,926 --> 00:33:07,051
Those headless bodies
still lay buried somewhere,

572
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:09,426
but nobody knows exactly where.

573
00:33:10,093 --> 00:33:15,426
Men used to spend their days eating
carom seeds and lazing around in bed.

574
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,593
- Carom seeds?
- They considered massages

575
00:33:16,718 --> 00:33:19,635
as exercise and pigeons
cradling as an art.

576
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,885
Carom seeds, massages, pigeons?

577
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:24,385
Looks like the author lost his mind.

578
00:33:24,885 --> 00:33:27,968
The author is trying
to say that after Stree left,

579
00:33:28,051 --> 00:33:29,968
that headless monster returned
and started taking those girls away.

580
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,010
Yes.

581
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:34,760
And we all thought our innocent girls
were just skipping town.

582
00:33:35,218 --> 00:33:37,760
You have become quite sharp in my company.

583
00:33:37,968 --> 00:33:39,218
- Thank you.
- Hold on a minute.

584
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:41,010
How do you know that?

585
00:33:44,843 --> 00:33:45,926
Well...

586
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,218
Well, she told me.

587
00:33:48,676 --> 00:33:50,218
Vicky, please.

588
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:52,426
She is back, I swear.

589
00:33:52,593 --> 00:33:55,010
Brother Rudra, he's daydreaming again.

590
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:57,093
- I'm not daydreaming, dummy.
- Really?

591
00:33:57,218 --> 00:34:02,218
If she in fact told you that,
then ask her where he took my Chitti!

592
00:34:04,468 --> 00:34:06,718
In all the excitement,
I forgot to ask her that.

593
00:34:07,843 --> 00:34:11,468
But I'll ask her next time I meet her.

594
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,760
There's nothing to be excited
about in that.

595
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,885
No, in fact, I'm sad.

596
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,093
Chitti...

597
00:34:24,468 --> 00:34:26,426
"You call for me,"

598
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,551
"And I'll come without a care,"

599
00:34:28,635 --> 00:34:32,760
"I won't be late, I swear,"

600
00:34:33,968 --> 00:34:35,926
You made this in just one day?

601
00:34:36,301 --> 00:34:38,260
Not a whole day - just a few hours,
actually.

602
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,801
You are an amazing artist.

603
00:34:41,968 --> 00:34:43,135
Thank you.

604
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:47,301
"I'll stop breathing,"

605
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:51,093
"But my word I'll keep,"

606
00:34:56,551 --> 00:35:04,801
"I was, I am,
and yours I'll always be,"

607
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:14,135
"I was, I am,
and yours I'll always be,"

608
00:35:14,801 --> 00:35:22,885
Even ages seem like moments,
o' my love so true,"

609
00:35:23,176 --> 00:35:31,843
"This is how special your love is
for me and you,"

610
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:40,176
"I was, I am,
and yours I'll always be,"

611
00:35:41,885 --> 00:35:43,801
"You promised long ago, "

612
00:35:44,093 --> 00:35:46,096
"And now you've returned,"

613
00:35:46,176 --> 00:35:49,763
"I'm grateful you're here
for my heart has yearned,"

614
00:35:49,843 --> 00:35:51,551
"You're welcome,"

615
00:35:51,635 --> 00:35:53,676
"You're always welcome here,"

616
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,510
"Come and promise
you'll never again disappear,"

617
00:36:03,218 --> 00:36:11,093
"It is true love,
that never ends, trust me"

618
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:20,093
"I was, I am,
and yours I'll always be,"

619
00:36:21,051 --> 00:36:23,551
"You promised long ago, "

620
00:36:23,635 --> 00:36:25,760
"And now you've returned,"

621
00:36:25,843 --> 00:36:29,055
"I'm grateful you're here
for my heart has yearned,"

622
00:36:29,135 --> 00:36:31,051
"You're welcome,"

623
00:36:31,135 --> 00:36:33,176
"You're always welcome here,"

624
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:38,135
"Come and promise
you'll never again disappear,"

625
00:36:57,843 --> 00:36:58,760
- Vicky!
- She bit me!

626
00:36:58,843 --> 00:36:59,385
Hurry up!

627
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:01,010
- She bit me!
- Vicky!

628
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,051
- Vicky! Vicky!
- My finger!

629
00:37:03,135 --> 00:37:04,385
What happened, Vicky?

630
00:37:04,468 --> 00:37:05,510
What's wrong?

631
00:37:05,593 --> 00:37:07,010
- Love bite.
- Love bite!

632
00:37:07,093 --> 00:37:08,718
Brother Rudra!
Where are you going? Come here.

633
00:37:08,798 --> 00:37:10,593
- Love bite! Love bite!
- What is it?

634
00:37:10,676 --> 00:37:11,885
- Love bite!
- Where is it?

635
00:37:11,968 --> 00:37:13,093
Love bite!

636
00:37:13,173 --> 00:37:14,176
A love bite on a finger?

637
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,801
Where's the love bite?

638
00:37:18,843 --> 00:37:19,968
What?

639
00:37:23,051 --> 00:37:26,135
Well, I got a little carried away so...

640
00:37:26,343 --> 00:37:27,718
She bit me.

641
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:29,135
Who?

642
00:37:29,385 --> 00:37:31,718
My girl.

643
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:33,676
Sounds like a repeat performance.

644
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,926
- No! I swear on Daddy!
- Then what?

645
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,676
Candles were burning everywhere,
flowers were raining down.

646
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,510
I was flying around like Superman.

647
00:37:43,593 --> 00:37:46,218
Okay, so then where did the flowers
and candles go?

648
00:37:48,635 --> 00:37:49,885
Where are the candles?

649
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:54,718
Looks like she packed everything up
and left, huh?

650
00:37:56,135 --> 00:38:00,051
I'm sure you must have asked her
where that monster took Chitti, right?

651
00:38:01,593 --> 00:38:03,010
So where did he take her?

652
00:38:05,385 --> 00:38:06,676
Vicky,

653
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,096
honestly, stop daydreaming.

654
00:38:09,176 --> 00:38:11,135
This is no fantasy. It's true.

655
00:38:11,635 --> 00:38:12,926
It's true love.

656
00:38:13,135 --> 00:38:15,051
And where can we find
this true love of yours?

657
00:38:15,676 --> 00:38:16,801
Bittu,

658
00:38:17,176 --> 00:38:19,135
there's a realm beyond right and wrong.

659
00:38:19,885 --> 00:38:21,301
That's where you'll find her.

660
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,051
There's an asylum just
a few blocks from that realm.

661
00:38:25,343 --> 00:38:27,051
That's where we'll find you
in a couple of days!

662
00:38:27,135 --> 00:38:28,343
Idiot!

663
00:38:28,468 --> 00:38:29,676
Hey!

664
00:38:30,051 --> 00:38:31,301
Bittu...

665
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,760
Vicky.

666
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:34,010
Right.

667
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,760
Vicky,

668
00:38:36,885 --> 00:38:41,051
I say this because I'm older and wiser.

669
00:38:42,051 --> 00:38:45,385
What you saw and felt

670
00:38:46,135 --> 00:38:47,385
was just an illusion.

671
00:38:48,135 --> 00:38:49,343
It's not real.

672
00:38:50,135 --> 00:38:52,885
How many more whacks will it take
for you to get that?

673
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:01,218
Vicky,
we're counting on you

674
00:39:02,218 --> 00:39:04,260
to help us find Chitti.

675
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:05,260
Come on!

676
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,676
Bittu?

677
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,051
- No, please don't cry.
- Let me go, Vicky.

678
00:39:09,135 --> 00:39:11,135
If you have so much faith in me,
I won't let you down.

679
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:12,801
I'm Vicky, after all.

680
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,718
I've found a way to get Chitti back
from that headless monster.

681
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,135
What's the plan?

682
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,885
To defeat this headless monster,

683
00:39:26,218 --> 00:39:28,051
we'll have to call Stree back.

684
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,301
Have you lost your mind?

685
00:39:33,385 --> 00:39:35,135
"We'll have to call Stree back," he says.

686
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,635
Chanderi got rid
of Stree with great difficulty.

687
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,301
All her power was in her braid
that you had cut off.

688
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,051
So what's the point of calling her then?

689
00:39:43,343 --> 00:39:44,718
Stree can't help us.

690
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,135
She can.

691
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:49,926
Because she is Stree.

692
00:39:50,843 --> 00:39:53,926
Even without her braid, she's powerful.

693
00:39:55,051 --> 00:39:57,801
She doesn't need the braid to be strong.

694
00:40:00,801 --> 00:40:02,010
So then...

695
00:40:06,468 --> 00:40:08,843
But how will we call her back?

696
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:12,051
We know someone
who can lead us to Stree.

697
00:40:16,926 --> 00:40:18,176
Anybody home?

698
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,760
What are you staring at?

699
00:40:35,843 --> 00:40:37,718
Jana! Jana! Jana!

700
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:38,968
I missed you guys so much!

701
00:40:39,051 --> 00:40:40,635
Cut the drama.

702
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:42,051
We called you so many times.

703
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:43,096
Sorry, guys.

704
00:40:43,176 --> 00:40:44,593
I used to have seizures.

705
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:45,968
People thought I was cursed.

706
00:40:46,051 --> 00:40:47,301
So Mom sent me here

707
00:40:47,385 --> 00:40:48,801
and made me delete all contacts.

708
00:40:48,885 --> 00:40:51,135
She made me block your numbers too.

709
00:40:51,218 --> 00:40:53,385
You forget your friends for a woman?

710
00:40:53,676 --> 00:40:55,010
She's my mother, dude.

711
00:40:55,385 --> 00:40:56,426
Sorry.

712
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,760
Jana...

713
00:40:57,843 --> 00:40:59,843
It's time to be a good friend to us now.

714
00:41:00,218 --> 00:41:01,176
Okay?

715
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,260
Only you can find her now.

716
00:41:03,593 --> 00:41:04,843
Who?

717
00:41:06,718 --> 00:41:07,843
Her!

718
00:41:08,593 --> 00:41:10,343
Her effect still lingers inside you,
correct?

719
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,010
You still get seizures, right?

720
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,260
Yes?

721
00:41:13,343 --> 00:41:14,551
Yes.

722
00:41:16,135 --> 00:41:17,801
- Did you hear that?
- What sound?

723
00:41:17,885 --> 00:41:19,301
- Did you hear that?
- No.

724
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:20,301
- Are you lying to us?
- No.

725
00:41:20,385 --> 00:41:22,801
- Are you enjoying in private?
- No, man.

726
00:41:22,885 --> 00:41:25,680
- Who is it?
- A special friend, huh? Friendship?

727
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
- No...
- Introduce us, too.

728
00:41:27,843 --> 00:41:29,385
Vicky, please. Vicky, please.

729
00:41:29,468 --> 00:41:30,096
No, dude.

730
00:41:30,176 --> 00:41:32,593
- Tinted room!
- Hear me out...

731
00:41:32,676 --> 00:41:34,718
- Vicky! Here's his lady...
- Hear me out... Don't go in there!

732
00:41:34,801 --> 00:41:36,051
- Your special friend, huh?
- Don't go in there!

733
00:41:36,135 --> 00:41:38,593
- It's my uncle's room. Listen...
- Your special friend!

734
00:41:47,551 --> 00:41:48,843
Bhask--

735
00:41:54,593 --> 00:41:55,968
I told you not to go in there.

736
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,135
He took off.

737
00:41:57,218 --> 00:41:58,385
Why don't you ever listen to me?

738
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:01,176
- You used to be such a scaredy-cat.
- Yes.

739
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,218
How did you end up with
a dangerous dog like that as a pet?

740
00:42:03,635 --> 00:42:04,801
Change, Vicky.

741
00:42:05,051 --> 00:42:06,760
Change is the only constant in this world.

742
00:42:06,843 --> 00:42:08,093
I'm not the same old Jana you knew.

743
00:42:08,176 --> 00:42:10,468
- I'm a changed guy now. For real.
- Don't get all Einstein on us, dude.

744
00:42:11,093 --> 00:42:12,968
Let's talk about why we're here.

745
00:42:13,051 --> 00:42:14,176
What did you want to discuss?

746
00:42:14,718 --> 00:42:15,885
- Well, you see...
- Listen, Jana,

747
00:42:16,135 --> 00:42:17,551
you need to come back to Chanderi with us.

748
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:18,760
Why?

749
00:42:19,051 --> 00:42:20,260
We need to find Stree.

750
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:23,843
Has he lost it?

751
00:42:23,926 --> 00:42:25,135
Nah, I have not.

752
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,260
You should do it for Chanderi.

753
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:27,718
Who in their right mind
would jump into a deadly well?

754
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:28,760
You got to come with us!
Let's get going.

755
00:42:28,843 --> 00:42:30,176
I need to study for the IAS exam,
got to take care of him.

756
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,676
- To hell with your studies and your dog!
- Did you hear that?

757
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,593
- Bittu! Jana!
- What?

758
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:34,676
- He's just blowing smoke.
- Yeah, he talks without thinking. Idiot.

759
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,176
- No, we don't need to find Stree.
- Then?

760
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,468
You have a part to play in Stree's play.

761
00:42:39,593 --> 00:42:40,801
- Which play?
- Which play?

762
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:43,968
The one Brother Rudra's putting on?

763
00:42:44,051 --> 00:42:45,885
- The one where Jana has to be in?
- Yup,

764
00:42:45,968 --> 00:42:48,301
you got to be in Brother Rudra's play.

765
00:42:48,385 --> 00:42:49,676
- Yes.
- Yes.

766
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,468
- You have an important role in it.
- Yes

767
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,926
- "A special experience."
- Wow.

768
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,135
- For real?
- Yup.

769
00:42:54,926 --> 00:42:56,135
When do I start packing my bags?

770
00:42:56,343 --> 00:42:57,301
Let's go right now.

771
00:42:57,385 --> 00:43:01,593
"You made a promise but it was a lie,"

772
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,593
It's in the back. Check there.

773
00:43:04,885 --> 00:43:08,885
"You made a promise but it was a lie,"

774
00:43:08,968 --> 00:43:11,218
- "I waited all night in the fields"
- What's up?

775
00:43:11,301 --> 00:43:13,176
"but you never came by."

776
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,760
"I waited all night in the fields
but you never came by."

777
00:43:16,843 --> 00:43:20,510
"I waited all night in the fields
but you never came by."

778
00:43:20,593 --> 00:43:24,968
"I waited all night in the fields
but you never came by."

779
00:43:31,426 --> 00:43:33,551
- Mummy!
- Jana!

780
00:43:33,635 --> 00:43:37,135
- Jana's back! You look great.
- That's enough.

781
00:43:37,843 --> 00:43:39,760
- How have you been?
- I'm doing alright.

782
00:43:39,968 --> 00:43:41,926
- Why'd you come back from Delhi?
- Because of Vicky and Bittu.

783
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,385
- Vicky and Bittu?
- Greetings, Aunty.

784
00:43:43,468 --> 00:43:45,135
- Greetings, Aunty.
- Greetings, Bittu!

785
00:43:45,218 --> 00:43:48,885
"With no blanket to warm me
in the middle of the night,"

786
00:43:48,968 --> 00:43:52,760
"With no blanket to warm me
in the middle of the night,"

787
00:43:52,843 --> 00:43:56,551
"You said you'd be there
but you never came by."

788
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:59,718
"I waited all night in the fields
but you never came by."

789
00:43:59,801 --> 00:44:03,718
Oh, Jana,
I'm so glad to see you back here.

790
00:44:04,176 --> 00:44:06,051
You still look the same,

791
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,843
like a little cricket.

792
00:44:07,926 --> 00:44:09,218
Thank you, Brother Rudra.

793
00:44:09,635 --> 00:44:10,968
- Cricket!
- Cricket!

794
00:44:11,051 --> 00:44:12,676
Come on, have a seat.

795
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,551
No, not here, go sit over there.

796
00:44:16,843 --> 00:44:19,593
Alright, tell me when do I get
my big moment in the play?

797
00:44:19,843 --> 00:44:20,843
What play?

798
00:44:21,343 --> 00:44:22,385
Your play.

799
00:44:22,468 --> 00:44:23,510
My play?

800
00:44:23,676 --> 00:44:26,676
Actually, we brought you here
for an important job.

801
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,676
What important job?

802
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,968
Look,

803
00:44:29,426 --> 00:44:30,801
there's no need to be scared.

804
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:33,426
Chanderi's in trouble again.

805
00:44:33,718 --> 00:44:36,718
A dangerous and powerful headless monster

806
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,301
has kidnapped Bittu's step-girlfriend.

807
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:40,676
No way.

808
00:44:41,468 --> 00:44:42,510
Impossible.

809
00:44:42,593 --> 00:44:43,426
Unbelievable.

810
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:46,010
I couldn't believe it
at first either, Jana.

811
00:44:46,135 --> 00:44:47,343
But it's the truth.

812
00:44:47,426 --> 00:44:48,885
I can accept a headless monster,

813
00:44:49,385 --> 00:44:51,426
but how am I supposed to believe
that Bittu has a girlfriend?

814
00:44:51,551 --> 00:44:52,593
It's a miracle.

815
00:44:52,676 --> 00:44:55,843
Miracles do happen in this world.

816
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:57,843
Did they even do the "friendship"?

817
00:44:57,968 --> 00:44:59,510
He goes for "friendship",

818
00:44:59,801 --> 00:45:01,426
but just sings her lullabies and leaves.

819
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:03,385
I'd love to hear that lullaby.

820
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:07,010
Soft Chitti, warm Chitti,
little ball of fur.

821
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,593
- Someone stop him.
- Forget about it. Stop.

822
00:45:09,718 --> 00:45:11,343
The point is,

823
00:45:11,801 --> 00:45:14,885
that this dangerous headless monster
took his girlfriend.

824
00:45:14,968 --> 00:45:15,926
Yes.

825
00:45:16,051 --> 00:45:19,801
We need Stree's help to get her back.

826
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,426
And Stree is like a sister to you.

827
00:45:22,718 --> 00:45:25,093
So you'll help us find her.

828
00:45:26,635 --> 00:45:27,718
- No way! Absolutely not!
- We love you.

829
00:45:27,801 --> 00:45:29,135
- Jana!
- I'm not going to help find anyone!

830
00:45:29,218 --> 00:45:29,843
- Jana!
- Jana!

831
00:45:29,926 --> 00:45:31,301
No, Brother Rudra, you don't get it.

832
00:45:31,385 --> 00:45:32,718
I have to study for the IAS exams.

833
00:45:32,801 --> 00:45:34,051
- I'm heading back to Delhi.
- Jana!

834
00:45:34,135 --> 00:45:35,468
- Jana!
- Yes?

835
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:36,885
Look me in the eyes.

836
00:45:37,093 --> 00:45:38,718
- Can you see the truth in them?
- Nah.

837
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:41,218
Come on, Jana, you can see the truth.

838
00:45:41,426 --> 00:45:42,635
Okay, maybe a little bit.

839
00:45:42,801 --> 00:45:44,135
You don't have to do much.

840
00:45:44,635 --> 00:45:46,096
Disha Batani. That's it.

841
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:47,718
Who is she now?

842
00:45:47,926 --> 00:45:48,718
Who's who?

843
00:45:48,801 --> 00:45:50,718
- You just mentioned her.
- Hey! Step side! Move it!

844
00:45:51,593 --> 00:45:53,885
You need to guide us
in the right direction.

845
00:45:54,343 --> 00:45:55,301
No, no, no.

846
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:58,468
Jana, Stree's effect still lingers in you.

847
00:45:58,676 --> 00:46:00,926
Just tell us where to find her
and we'll handle the rest.

848
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:02,426
She'll end up handling all of us instead.

849
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:03,676
There's nothing to be afraid of.

850
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,301
Have I ever let anything
bad happen to you?

851
00:46:06,385 --> 00:46:08,385
You put a frog in my pants
when we were in 5th grade.

852
00:46:08,468 --> 00:46:09,343
Have you forgotten that?

853
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:10,385
After that?

854
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:11,096
In 10th grade,

855
00:46:11,176 --> 00:46:12,926
you guys locked me
in the ladies' room and ran off.

856
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:13,718
After that?

857
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:16,176
You had me hang upside down
in college to steal a kite.

858
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,385
Where the heck was that kite anyway?

859
00:46:17,926 --> 00:46:18,760
- After that?
- After that?

860
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:19,718
After that?

861
00:46:19,885 --> 00:46:20,843
After that?

862
00:46:20,926 --> 00:46:21,718
Nothing.

863
00:46:21,801 --> 00:46:23,301
You didn't do anything else after that.

864
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,426
We always step out at night.

865
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:33,510
And I have to lie to my mom.

866
00:46:33,593 --> 00:46:34,551
So what? We are friends, right?

867
00:46:34,635 --> 00:46:36,968
By the way Vicky, you didn't have to lie,
you know?

868
00:46:37,048 --> 00:46:38,135
You committed a sin.

869
00:46:40,802 --> 00:46:42,385
Slow down, Brother Rudra.

870
00:46:50,926 --> 00:46:51,801
Ugh,

871
00:46:53,926 --> 00:46:56,010
and now we're back
at this inauspicious place again.

872
00:46:59,968 --> 00:47:02,051
You know what, why don't we just come
back here in the morning instead?

873
00:47:02,135 --> 00:47:03,343
- Nah,
- Let's go.

874
00:47:03,426 --> 00:47:05,051
Stree's a nocturnal creature.

875
00:47:05,135 --> 00:47:06,551
She's only going to come out at night.

876
00:47:06,635 --> 00:47:07,885
- Okay.
- Brother Rudra, can I say something?

877
00:47:07,968 --> 00:47:10,676
Come on, Jana,
you've got to save your sister-in-law.

878
00:47:10,968 --> 00:47:12,426
Why do I have to be the one
to do this, though?

879
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:13,051
She is your younger sister-in-law
after all!

880
00:47:13,135 --> 00:47:14,051
Because there's literally
no one else who can, that's why.

881
00:47:14,135 --> 00:47:15,135
- Alright, let's go.
- Where are we going?

882
00:47:15,218 --> 00:47:16,176
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

883
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,760
Why do I have to lead the way?

884
00:47:18,718 --> 00:47:19,843
- Just go on, lead the way.
- What?

885
00:47:19,926 --> 00:47:20,760
- I said, lead the way.
- Why should I have to lead the way?

886
00:47:20,843 --> 00:47:23,010
Just go on, get moving.
Go, call your sister. Call her.

887
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,385
- How do I call her?
- Call her.

888
00:47:26,801 --> 00:47:27,968
Hey Sister?

889
00:47:29,718 --> 00:47:30,843
Stree, my darling sister?

890
00:47:31,135 --> 00:47:32,010
Hello?

891
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,385
Look who's here, Sister.

892
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:35,676
Call her nicely!

893
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,010
Yes, call her.

894
00:47:37,551 --> 00:47:39,510
"Sister, my darling sister!"

895
00:47:39,593 --> 00:47:41,635
"Sister! My sweet-sweet sister!"

896
00:47:42,968 --> 00:47:43,968
Sister...?

897
00:47:44,051 --> 00:47:45,635
Nah, she ain't coming.

898
00:47:46,426 --> 00:47:48,343
She's not going to show up like this.

899
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:50,676
Stree only comes when men are all alone.

900
00:47:53,843 --> 00:47:55,968
Bittu? Brother Rudra?
Can you two come over here for a second?

901
00:47:56,051 --> 00:47:57,510
- Come on.
- No.

902
00:47:57,968 --> 00:47:59,635
- This is an adult conversation.
- Okay, you got to step back for this one.

903
00:47:59,718 --> 00:48:00,718
- Okay.
- But I'm an adult too, you know!

904
00:48:00,801 --> 00:48:02,385
We'll fill you in on it later.

905
00:48:05,135 --> 00:48:06,635
He's absolutely right.

906
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:09,801
We have to leave him alone if we want Stree
to actually show up and kidnap him.

907
00:48:09,885 --> 00:48:11,176
But what if he scares himself to death?

908
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,676
Nah, he'll be fine.

909
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,051
He's right.

910
00:48:14,176 --> 00:48:15,635
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

911
00:48:16,926 --> 00:48:18,385
So, what were you all talking about, huh?

912
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:19,843
Hey, check it out! A rainbow!

913
00:48:19,926 --> 00:48:21,301
- Where?
- Oh, look at that leaf, it's so green!

914
00:48:21,385 --> 00:48:22,510
Where's the rainbow?

915
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,718
No, there's no rainbow here, silly.

916
00:48:30,176 --> 00:48:31,301
Vicky!

917
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:34,343
Seriously,
this isn't the time for hide-and-seek!

918
00:48:34,593 --> 00:48:35,760
Vicky didn't come with us?

919
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,010
Vicky didn't come with us?

920
00:48:37,635 --> 00:48:38,718
Go check and see where he is.

921
00:48:38,885 --> 00:48:40,426
- Vicky?
- You go check on him.

922
00:48:42,051 --> 00:48:43,343
Bittu?

923
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,426
You have the torch. You go check on him.

924
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,885
But I have really bad eyesight, you know.

925
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,718
- You have bad eyesight?
- Yeah.

926
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,343
- Okay, we'll do it together then.
- Sounds good.

927
00:48:57,926 --> 00:48:59,843
Hey, what was that noise?

928
00:49:00,301 --> 00:49:01,468
What noise?

929
00:49:01,676 --> 00:49:03,096
The noise you just made.

930
00:49:03,176 --> 00:49:04,718
No, I didn't.

931
00:49:04,843 --> 00:49:06,385
Where'd that come from?

932
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,301
I heard it too.

933
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,593
Bloody rascals! Left me stranded!

934
00:49:12,676 --> 00:49:15,676
Lied to me about the rainbow!

935
00:49:25,135 --> 00:49:27,510
Vicky! Vicky! Vicky!

936
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,926
Jana!

937
00:49:34,426 --> 00:49:35,635
- Jana!
- Jana!

938
00:49:35,718 --> 00:49:37,051
- Jana!
- Jana!

939
00:49:37,135 --> 00:49:38,301
- Jana!
- Jana!

940
00:49:38,385 --> 00:49:39,635
Hair! Hair! Hair!

941
00:49:39,718 --> 00:49:41,385
- Hair?
- Hair! It touched me.

942
00:49:41,676 --> 00:49:42,718
Wait a second,

943
00:49:43,051 --> 00:49:44,510
you said there was
a rainbow out there, right?

944
00:49:44,593 --> 00:49:45,843
Where exactly was it?

945
00:49:46,385 --> 00:49:47,551
There was one out there, right?

946
00:49:47,635 --> 00:49:48,635
Whose bright idea was it, anyway?

947
00:49:48,718 --> 00:49:50,010
- Bittu?
- Nah, it was all Vicky's idea.

948
00:49:50,135 --> 00:49:51,510
Brother Rudra, I told you this plan
of yours is not looking too good.

949
00:49:51,593 --> 00:49:52,926
Honestly, I didn't expect this from you,
Brother Rudra.

950
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:55,468
Alright, I'll apologize on his behalf.

951
00:49:55,801 --> 00:49:57,135
Listen up, guys,

952
00:49:57,593 --> 00:49:58,885
I know where we can find Ms. Stree.

953
00:49:58,968 --> 00:50:00,176
Then why didn't you tell us sooner?

954
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:02,051
- I just got the script.
- Okay.

955
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,718
There's a spot around here with
a bunch of statues.

956
00:50:05,801 --> 00:50:07,096
- Okay.
- We have to find that place.

957
00:50:07,176 --> 00:50:07,885
Okay.

958
00:50:07,968 --> 00:50:09,051
But not alone.

959
00:50:09,135 --> 00:50:11,010
- But we stick together, right?
- No splitting up.

960
00:50:11,135 --> 00:50:11,885
Form a square.

961
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:13,010
- Form a square.
- Do I have to turn around?

962
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,676
Let's have each other's backs,
and form a square.

963
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,760
- Just like we used to do when we were kids.
- I know, I know.

964
00:50:17,051 --> 00:50:18,593
- Which way do we have to go? That way?
- No!

965
00:50:18,676 --> 00:50:20,760
- Move anti-clockwise.
- Move anti-clockwise.

966
00:50:20,843 --> 00:50:22,510
- Vicky, give us some direction.
- That way.

967
00:50:22,593 --> 00:50:23,760
- Okay.
- That way. Okay.

968
00:50:23,843 --> 00:50:24,885
Easy, Brother Rudra.

969
00:50:24,968 --> 00:50:25,926
Don't rush it.

970
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:27,468
Slow down, I'm an old man!

971
00:50:27,551 --> 00:50:29,635
- You're not that old!
- O' Stree...

972
00:50:30,593 --> 00:50:31,760
Ms. Stree,

973
00:50:34,051 --> 00:50:36,135
I've got some friends here with me.

974
00:50:36,676 --> 00:50:37,760
I am Vicky.

975
00:50:38,551 --> 00:50:40,343
We'd like to have a word with you.

976
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:45,593
Ms. Stree?

977
00:50:47,301 --> 00:50:48,426
Over here.

978
00:50:49,135 --> 00:50:50,926
- Come stand over here.
- Okay.

979
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:53,176
And she'll call you from behind.

980
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:54,885
- Why are we doing this again?
- Oh,

981
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:58,426
I remember seeing this statue
in the Chanderi Puran.

982
00:50:59,051 --> 00:51:01,385
Did you find out
who sent you those torn pages?

983
00:51:01,635 --> 00:51:02,760
It must've been Mr. Shastri, right?

984
00:51:02,843 --> 00:51:05,426
Mr. Shastri passed away ages ago.

985
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,010
- Huh?
- Oh no.

986
00:51:08,343 --> 00:51:09,426
Jana,

987
00:51:09,843 --> 00:51:11,135
you need to think about Stree--

988
00:51:11,343 --> 00:51:12,135
Huh?

989
00:51:12,676 --> 00:51:13,843
- Jana!
- Jana!

990
00:51:15,551 --> 00:51:16,926
Look, over there! Over there!

991
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:28,843
Oh no!

992
00:51:28,926 --> 00:51:29,843
- Jana!
- Jana!

993
00:51:29,926 --> 00:51:30,760
- Jana!
- Jana!

994
00:51:30,843 --> 00:51:32,218
How did he get stuck up there?

995
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:34,010
Jana! Come on down, Jana!

996
00:51:34,135 --> 00:51:35,426
- Jana!
- Jana!

997
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,426
- Get down from there!
- He's passed out!

998
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,885
- Huh? Looks like he's got cataract!
- He's unconscious, look at him!

999
00:51:41,385 --> 00:51:42,926
- Stree must've hung him up there.
- Oh no.

1000
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:45,718
We're sorry, Ms. Stree.

1001
00:51:45,968 --> 00:51:47,010
Please forgive us.

1002
00:51:47,135 --> 00:51:49,468
- We apologize.
- Please let our friend go.

1003
00:51:49,551 --> 00:51:51,135
- Okay.
- Ms. Stree, please!

1004
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,635
Jana!

1005
00:51:52,718 --> 00:51:53,843
- Jana!
- Jana!

1006
00:51:54,051 --> 00:51:55,343
- Open your eyes, Jana.
- Jana!

1007
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:56,676
Hey Jana...

1008
00:51:56,885 --> 00:51:57,843
Jana?

1009
00:51:58,051 --> 00:52:00,051
Jana? Jana? Wake up. Get up.

1010
00:52:00,176 --> 00:52:01,385
- Jana?
- Jana?

1011
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:02,926
- Say something.
- Jana?

1012
00:52:03,176 --> 00:52:04,010
Wake up, Jana!

1013
00:52:04,135 --> 00:52:05,718
Brother Rudra, please do something.

1014
00:52:06,343 --> 00:52:07,760
Jana...

1015
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,968
Say something, Jana.

1016
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,135
- He's gone.
- Huh?

1017
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:15,135
He's gone.

1018
00:52:15,885 --> 00:52:17,096
Have you lost your mind?

1019
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:18,343
He's not gone!

1020
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,096
Jana!

1021
00:52:19,176 --> 00:52:20,343
Get up, Jana!

1022
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:21,551
Come on, Jana, get up!

1023
00:52:21,718 --> 00:52:23,135
Open your eyes, Jana! Jana!

1024
00:52:23,385 --> 00:52:26,135
You don't have to find Stree, Jana!
Come on, get up, Jana!

1025
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,801
Come on, get up, Jana! Please, Jana!

1026
00:52:29,135 --> 00:52:33,510
We'll plan a trip to Goa,
we'll go to Goa together...

1027
00:52:33,593 --> 00:52:35,051
Jana...

1028
00:52:35,801 --> 00:52:36,718
Jana...

1029
00:52:36,926 --> 00:52:38,676
Jana, get up!

1030
00:52:40,176 --> 00:52:41,718
Jana...

1031
00:52:42,176 --> 00:52:44,301
Come on, Jana!

1032
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,926
Jana, get up!

1033
00:52:46,135 --> 00:52:47,343
Jana! Wake up!

1034
00:52:47,426 --> 00:52:50,718
He's not going to wake up.

1035
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:52,426
- Jana...
- Jana...

1036
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,010
Jana...

1037
00:53:19,301 --> 00:53:20,593
Run!

1038
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,510
Run!

1039
00:53:25,176 --> 00:53:26,468
This way, Jana! This way!

1040
00:53:26,551 --> 00:53:29,051
This way! We need to go this way!

1041
00:53:29,135 --> 00:53:30,593
Jana is alive!

1042
00:53:33,385 --> 00:53:36,676
Jana! Jana! Jana! Jana!

1043
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,676
You are alive! You are alive!
You are alive, Jana!

1044
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,593
- He is safe!
- We thought you were dead!

1045
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,385
I even gave you a French kiss.

1046
00:53:43,468 --> 00:53:44,426
Thank goodness!

1047
00:53:44,593 --> 00:53:46,343
- We don't have time for this, let's go!
- What for?

1048
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:47,760
- He's coming!
- Who?

1049
00:53:47,843 --> 00:53:49,176
HE!!!!

1050
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:50,551
RUN!!!

1051
00:53:50,635 --> 00:53:52,385
- Run!
- Hurry up! Start the bike.

1052
00:53:52,468 --> 00:53:53,343
Hurry up, guys!

1053
00:53:53,426 --> 00:53:55,426
- Come on, Brother Rudra!
- Let's go, guys! Hurry up!

1054
00:53:55,718 --> 00:53:57,635
- Quick, Bittu!
- Yeah, yeah.

1055
00:53:57,718 --> 00:53:59,801
- What's wrong?
- I think we're running out of gas!

1056
00:54:00,718 --> 00:54:01,635
How much did you buy?

1057
00:54:01,718 --> 00:54:02,718
Worth 50 bucks.

1058
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:04,843
That's hardly enough for a burp!

1059
00:54:04,926 --> 00:54:06,051
You cheapskate!

1060
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:08,426
It's not his fault, Vicky!

1061
00:54:08,551 --> 00:54:09,635
It's his dad's fault.

1062
00:54:09,718 --> 00:54:10,718
Don't drag my dad into this.

1063
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:12,718
So what do you want us to do?
Drag your bike in this situation!

1064
00:54:13,093 --> 00:54:14,843
- Jana, start pushing.
- Push it.

1065
00:54:15,343 --> 00:54:16,676
Yeah, push it.

1066
00:54:16,843 --> 00:54:17,968
Let's go, guys.

1067
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:19,843
- Jana...
- Hurry up! Hurry up!

1068
00:54:19,926 --> 00:54:21,843
Let's go, let's go.

1069
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,885
Go, go, go. Hurry up.

1070
00:54:24,968 --> 00:54:27,468
Did you actually see something out there,
or are you just messing with me for kicks and giggles?

1071
00:54:56,718 --> 00:54:58,593
Trust me,
there was definitely someone out there.

1072
00:54:58,676 --> 00:54:59,635
Let's just head back home quickly.

1073
00:54:59,718 --> 00:55:01,051
- Let's go.
- Not home, the fair.

1074
00:55:01,135 --> 00:55:02,343
Let's head to the fair instead.

1075
00:55:02,801 --> 00:55:04,051
Step on it, Bittu! What's wrong?

1076
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:06,051
What the heck
is that thing behind us, Vicky?

1077
00:55:06,426 --> 00:55:07,551
Look back there.

1078
00:55:07,635 --> 00:55:08,551
What?

1079
00:55:11,593 --> 00:55:12,926
What is?

1080
00:55:25,718 --> 00:55:27,801
VICKY!

1081
00:55:27,885 --> 00:55:29,718
Jana! Jana! Behind you!

1082
00:55:29,801 --> 00:55:31,176
What?

1083
00:55:33,968 --> 00:55:36,551
Ouch! He bit me!

1084
00:55:36,635 --> 00:55:37,885
I can't balance.

1085
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:40,010
I'm about to die and you're worried
about the stupid balance!

1086
00:55:40,093 --> 00:55:41,343
We're going to fall!

1087
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:47,301
Let me go! Shoo, let me go!

1088
00:55:48,968 --> 00:55:51,051
Jana, use your elbow!
Hit him with your elbow!

1089
00:55:51,135 --> 00:55:52,843
Mummy! Help me!

1090
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,468
Mummy! Brother Rudra!

1091
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:55,885
- Here, take this.
- Brother Rudra!

1092
00:55:56,135 --> 00:55:57,510
This is no time to be drinking!

1093
00:55:57,593 --> 00:55:58,635
Throw it at him!

1094
00:55:58,718 --> 00:55:59,968
- Okay, fine.
- Throw it at him!

1095
00:56:00,051 --> 00:56:01,718
I'll throw it at him.

1096
00:56:02,718 --> 00:56:05,301
Take that, you monster!

1097
00:56:05,385 --> 00:56:06,885
- What do I do now?
- Burn him!

1098
00:56:06,968 --> 00:56:08,135
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Burn him!

1099
00:56:08,218 --> 00:56:09,885
Dear Lord, I earnestly pray,
please keep all the evil away!

1100
00:56:09,968 --> 00:56:11,051
Burn him!

1101
00:56:12,593 --> 00:56:13,551
Fire!

1102
00:56:13,968 --> 00:56:15,301
Brother Rudra! We did it!

1103
00:56:15,385 --> 00:56:16,968
Vicky! Bittu! Look out!

1104
00:56:17,551 --> 00:56:18,718
What's he doing?

1105
00:56:18,801 --> 00:56:20,135
NOOO!

1106
00:56:21,718 --> 00:56:23,635
Someone's head is stuck in the wheel!

1107
00:56:24,426 --> 00:56:25,676
Stop, Brother Rudra! Wait up!

1108
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,096
Run, Vicky! Run!

1109
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:30,343
- It's on fire! It's on fire! It's on fire!
- Vicky, don't look behind!

1110
00:56:30,426 --> 00:56:33,885
Run, my brother!
Stop the bike! Stop the bike!

1111
00:56:33,968 --> 00:56:37,013
Stop, stop, stop,
where are you going?

1112
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:40,635
- Go, go, go!
- Don't look behind.

1113
00:56:47,343 --> 00:56:48,676
Hurry up.

1114
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,426
This way.

1115
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:51,010
- Turn right.
- Yes, turn right.

1116
00:57:05,301 --> 00:57:06,096
I'm sorry!

1117
00:57:06,176 --> 00:57:07,218
- I'm sorry!
- Jana!

1118
00:57:07,301 --> 00:57:08,468
- I'm sorry!
- Jana!

1119
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:10,135
Stree, my sister, I'm sorry.

1120
00:57:10,676 --> 00:57:13,096
I'm sorry I came back.
I shouldn't have come back.

1121
00:57:13,176 --> 00:57:15,635
I shouldn't have come back.
I shouldn't have come back.

1122
00:57:15,718 --> 00:57:16,718
I'm such an idiot.

1123
00:57:16,801 --> 00:57:18,468
I'm a fool.

1124
00:57:18,676 --> 00:57:19,968
- I'm so stupid.
- No.

1125
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:21,676
No, I'm the stupid one. I'm so stupid.

1126
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,135
Why do I always get myself into trouble?

1127
00:57:23,301 --> 00:57:25,676
First the Stree, then the wolf,
and now the head.

1128
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,718
What wolf?

1129
00:57:26,801 --> 00:57:28,635
You came back for your sister-in-law.
You came back to save her.

1130
00:57:28,718 --> 00:57:29,801
Who Sister-in-law? Whose Sister-in-law?

1131
00:57:29,885 --> 00:57:31,968
- To hell with this sister-in-law!
- No, no, no.

1132
00:57:32,051 --> 00:57:33,343
A sister-in-law should be treated
just like a mother.

1133
00:57:33,426 --> 00:57:34,801
- No, I have only one mother.
- Relax.

1134
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:36,593
- Relax.
- Everything's going to be fine, Jana.

1135
00:57:37,426 --> 00:57:38,551
There's nothing to be afraid of, okay?

1136
00:57:38,635 --> 00:57:40,760
- No one is going to trouble you, Jana, okay?
- No way.

1137
00:57:42,301 --> 00:57:43,426
We're not going to take you anywhere.

1138
00:57:44,676 --> 00:57:45,676
What?

1139
00:57:45,801 --> 00:57:47,301
- What's wrong?
- What's going on?

1140
00:57:47,385 --> 00:57:48,176
He's coming back.

1141
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,010
Who?

1142
00:57:49,135 --> 00:57:49,926
HIM!

1143
00:58:06,926 --> 00:58:08,468
I told you--

1144
00:58:11,593 --> 00:58:12,801
Vicky?

1145
00:58:13,551 --> 00:58:14,968
Vicky? Vicky!

1146
00:58:16,718 --> 00:58:18,135
You guys left me and ran away again!

1147
00:58:21,801 --> 00:58:23,426
What do we do now?

1148
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:26,093
What?

1149
00:58:43,093 --> 00:58:44,676
- How do we get home?
- What?

1150
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,885
How do we get home?!

1151
00:58:45,968 --> 00:58:47,176
- Don't shout!
- Don't yell!

1152
00:58:48,635 --> 00:58:50,260
- Let's use the elephant.
- Huh?

1153
00:58:50,551 --> 00:58:51,843
We'll use this elephant.

1154
00:59:00,635 --> 00:59:02,510
Wrong way.

1155
00:59:03,635 --> 00:59:05,135
- Right.
- No, go left!

1156
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:07,010
Keep it down.

1157
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,468
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Keep it down.

1158
00:59:08,593 --> 00:59:10,385
- What are you doing?
- What happened?

1159
00:59:10,468 --> 00:59:11,843
We have to go left.

1160
00:59:12,093 --> 00:59:13,385
Our left or your left?

1161
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:20,426
Turn that off.

1162
00:59:27,676 --> 00:59:28,968
Stop that.

1163
00:59:29,051 --> 00:59:30,093
Go.

1164
00:59:36,051 --> 00:59:37,093
Go.

1165
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:39,676
Go see what that is.

1166
00:59:48,926 --> 00:59:51,010
- What happened?
- What is it?

1167
00:59:51,176 --> 00:59:53,926
It's the...

1168
00:59:54,676 --> 00:59:57,093
Vicky... check it out.

1169
00:59:58,135 --> 01:00:00,843
I'll check it out! I'll go check it out!

1170
01:00:08,218 --> 01:00:09,135
Nobody is here.

1171
01:00:09,218 --> 01:00:10,676
He was just standing right there!
I swear on my mom!

1172
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,510
- He's there!
- Scaring us for no reason...

1173
01:00:21,135 --> 01:00:22,982
Bow down! Bow down! Bow down!

1174
01:00:33,176 --> 01:00:34,510
Vicky!

1175
01:00:34,593 --> 01:00:36,676
Brother Rudra, he has Vicky!

1176
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:37,760
He picked him up like a ragdoll!

1177
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:39,468
- Hold him.
- Let's get him down.

1178
01:00:39,635 --> 01:00:42,301
- Glory to the Goddess!
- Pull him down. Pull him down.

1179
01:02:24,551 --> 01:02:26,138
No, no, no Vicky! Don't go out there!

1180
01:02:26,218 --> 01:02:28,343
- Don't go out there! No, no, no Vicky!
- Where did he go?

1181
01:02:29,593 --> 01:02:30,968
Where did he go?

1182
01:02:31,343 --> 01:02:32,593
Has he left?

1183
01:02:33,593 --> 01:02:35,010
Vicky! Vicky!

1184
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:36,551
Jana...

1185
01:02:37,426 --> 01:02:38,635
Take it easy, take it easy.

1186
01:02:38,718 --> 01:02:41,135
- Come on, get up.
- He left.

1187
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:44,343
Are you hurt?

1188
01:02:45,135 --> 01:02:47,093
- Greetings. Are you okay?
- Thank you for saving us.

1189
01:03:01,468 --> 01:03:03,635
OH NOOO!!

1190
01:03:03,718 --> 01:03:05,135
Mummy!

1191
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,343
Mummy!!!!

1192
01:03:07,051 --> 01:03:08,135
Are you okay?

1193
01:03:12,135 --> 01:03:13,926
Mummy!

1194
01:03:51,058 --> 01:03:52,183
He totally smashed it.

1195
01:03:52,852 --> 01:03:54,308
What's that thing exactly?

1196
01:03:55,183 --> 01:03:56,433
A Deadly Corpse.

1197
01:03:57,141 --> 01:03:58,433
A Messenger of Death.

1198
01:03:59,391 --> 01:04:00,475
And you, ma'am,

1199
01:04:01,225 --> 01:04:06,725
really gave the headless monster a run for his money
with this magical braid of yours.

1200
01:04:07,183 --> 01:04:08,100
Nice work.

1201
01:04:09,558 --> 01:04:12,933
Is this braid hers?

1202
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,558
- That...?
- Yes,

1203
01:04:15,766 --> 01:04:17,141
this is Stree's braid

1204
01:04:18,225 --> 01:04:21,016
- that I've been using to boost my powers.
- Oh!

1205
01:04:22,266 --> 01:04:25,808
That's how you were able to twirl
it like helicopter blades last night.

1206
01:04:27,058 --> 01:04:29,475
But seriously, Sister,
thanks for last night.

1207
01:04:29,683 --> 01:04:30,558
What?

1208
01:04:30,641 --> 01:04:32,016
- Thank you, Sister.
- Sister?

1209
01:04:32,141 --> 01:04:33,058
Yeah.

1210
01:04:33,141 --> 01:04:34,808
Now that she saved your life,
she's your sister, huh?

1211
01:04:35,266 --> 01:04:37,183
He calls you a witch behind your back.

1212
01:04:38,225 --> 01:04:40,141
And this guy addressing you as 'ma'am'

1213
01:04:40,766 --> 01:04:42,683
calls you an illusion,
an unfaithful lover, and whatnot.

1214
01:04:42,766 --> 01:04:43,225
He says that.

1215
01:04:43,308 --> 01:04:44,641
My apologies, ma'am.

1216
01:04:44,725 --> 01:04:46,145
You just disappeared from the bus.

1217
01:04:46,225 --> 01:04:49,516
We hadn't heard anything about you
for so long, that's why...

1218
01:04:49,725 --> 01:04:51,225
I went to study.

1219
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:53,475
Hear that? She went to study.

1220
01:04:53,558 --> 01:04:55,100
To study black magic.

1221
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:56,933
To study Black Magic.

1222
01:04:57,225 --> 01:05:00,433
Why'd you get mixed up in Black Magic
and the Red Book stuff?

1223
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,641
That doesn't fit your personality at all.

1224
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:08,808
Anyway, it's time to settle down in life.

1225
01:05:08,891 --> 01:05:11,183
Vicky, now's not the time
to think about all that.

1226
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:13,975
We need to focus on this headless monster.

1227
01:05:14,058 --> 01:05:16,100
- We have to figure out how to stop him.
- Yes, you're right.

1228
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:17,683
Only you can stop him.

1229
01:05:18,183 --> 01:05:20,808
You've even taken a course on black magic.

1230
01:05:21,058 --> 01:05:23,141
And with your magical braid...

1231
01:05:24,391 --> 01:05:28,100
No, my powers are nothing compared to his.

1232
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:29,850
Last night, you saw how

1233
01:05:29,933 --> 01:05:32,891
he picked me up like a ragdoll
and threw me away.

1234
01:05:33,683 --> 01:05:37,641
His powers are at their peak
during the Mahapooja festivities.

1235
01:05:38,016 --> 01:05:41,808
We'll have to stop him
before the very last day, or else...

1236
01:05:42,184 --> 01:05:43,266
Or else what?

1237
01:05:43,975 --> 01:05:45,308
We'll be facing a disaster.

1238
01:05:49,641 --> 01:05:51,100
Argh, you deserve hell
for what you did!

1239
01:05:51,183 --> 01:05:52,391
What kind of friends are you?

1240
01:05:52,475 --> 01:05:53,725
What's wrong? What happened?

1241
01:05:53,808 --> 01:05:55,100
Vicky,

1242
01:05:55,725 --> 01:05:57,308
my brother,
I haven't slept since last night.

1243
01:05:57,433 --> 01:05:59,558
- Why?
- As soon as I shut my eyelids,

1244
01:05:59,641 --> 01:06:01,100
I see images from that place.

1245
01:06:01,183 --> 01:06:02,516
Which place?

1246
01:06:02,683 --> 01:06:03,850
That place? What place?

1247
01:06:03,933 --> 01:06:05,266
- THAT place!
- Where?

1248
01:06:05,433 --> 01:06:06,433
- That place!
- What happened?

1249
01:06:06,516 --> 01:06:07,516
Where?

1250
01:06:07,808 --> 01:06:09,100
- What happened?
- Nah, he means the place you know.

1251
01:06:09,183 --> 01:06:10,683
He just came back from Delhi,
didn't he, Aunty?

1252
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:12,103
So he is having visions of that place.

1253
01:06:12,183 --> 01:06:14,103
The Red Fort, Ring Road, GB Road...

1254
01:06:14,183 --> 01:06:16,433
If that's the only stuff he's seeing,
Why is he so paranoid?

1255
01:06:16,516 --> 01:06:18,725
- He didn't sleep a wink last night.
- What's making you lose it, man?

1256
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,100
Can you help me get some shut-eye?

1257
01:06:20,183 --> 01:06:21,145
Why would she help you sleep?
Don't make me whack you.

1258
01:06:21,225 --> 01:06:23,850
- What the hell is going on with my son?
- Listen, listen, listen!

1259
01:06:24,058 --> 01:06:26,308
Have you got any castor oil on hand?

1260
01:06:26,391 --> 01:06:27,850
Just grab it and dab some on his eyes.

1261
01:06:27,933 --> 01:06:30,016
- That will make his vision go away.
- Mummy!

1262
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,103
- But...
- You're doomed, all of you!

1263
01:06:32,183 --> 01:06:33,850
- I mean...
- What kind of friends are you?

1264
01:06:33,933 --> 01:06:36,183
My son was a model student,
studying in Delhi.

1265
01:06:36,266 --> 01:06:37,766
- He would have become an IAS officer!
- Aunty...

1266
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:39,100
- But you dragged him here
- Aunty...

1267
01:06:39,183 --> 01:06:41,641
and who knows where you took
him that he is so scared.

1268
01:06:41,725 --> 01:06:42,683
He was up all night.

1269
01:06:47,475 --> 01:06:49,475
- What the heck?
- Give us two minutes, Aunty. Calm down.

1270
01:06:50,391 --> 01:06:52,016
Take a seat.

1271
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:53,516
Sit here.

1272
01:06:53,891 --> 01:06:54,850
Sit.

1273
01:07:13,266 --> 01:07:14,225
Thank you.

1274
01:07:16,183 --> 01:07:17,266
Now tell us,

1275
01:07:18,391 --> 01:07:19,433
what did you see?

1276
01:07:22,475 --> 01:07:23,475
I saw the place

1277
01:07:25,308 --> 01:07:27,141
that the headless monster came from.

1278
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:31,516
What's out there?

1279
01:07:32,183 --> 01:07:34,183
It was a very scary place, Brother.

1280
01:07:35,183 --> 01:07:38,850
That day, I didn't actually die.

1281
01:07:39,183 --> 01:07:40,350
I ended up going there.

1282
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:42,891
It was just darkness all around.

1283
01:07:43,266 --> 01:07:44,891
There weren't any leaves
on the trees at all.

1284
01:07:44,975 --> 01:07:46,433
Everything looked all dried up
and withered.

1285
01:07:47,391 --> 01:07:49,183
And the rocks were hanging upside down.

1286
01:07:50,558 --> 01:07:52,225
And there was lava, lots of lava.

1287
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,891
Excuse me, Sister? I'm Jana.

1288
01:07:59,433 --> 01:08:00,475
Chitti!

1289
01:08:01,475 --> 01:08:02,558
Chitti!

1290
01:08:04,933 --> 01:08:06,766
Who shaved your head?

1291
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:09,058
Chitti's bald!

1292
01:08:09,266 --> 01:08:10,433
Bald?

1293
01:08:10,975 --> 01:08:12,891
They shaved her head, man!

1294
01:08:13,225 --> 01:08:17,016
Aw, my Chitti had such amazing silky hair.

1295
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:21,103
I just got her this fancy shampoo
worth 2500 bucks, what a waste!

1296
01:08:21,183 --> 01:08:24,103
Why'd you have to buy her such
an expensive shampoo anyway?

1297
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:25,933
Come on, Brother Rudra,
love is love, you know.

1298
01:08:26,225 --> 01:08:30,891
I can't even imagine
how Chitti must look without hair, it's crazy.

1299
01:08:31,183 --> 01:08:32,725
Stop crying, you big baby.

1300
01:08:33,225 --> 01:08:35,141
You're Bittu, not Sneha Kakkar, alright?

1301
01:08:35,975 --> 01:08:38,891
What's his problem with my Chitti,
huh Vicky?

1302
01:08:39,016 --> 01:08:41,183
- What's his issue with her?
- It's not just Chitti,

1303
01:08:41,933 --> 01:08:44,266
he's got issues with all the modern girls

1304
01:08:44,391 --> 01:08:46,183
whose thoughts are liberal.

1305
01:08:46,266 --> 01:08:47,725
Hmm.

1306
01:08:48,183 --> 01:08:51,183
Most of the girls
who went missing from our town

1307
01:08:51,683 --> 01:08:54,016
were quite modern, you know.

1308
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,058
Correct.

1309
01:08:55,141 --> 01:08:56,266
Yeah.

1310
01:08:56,641 --> 01:08:58,266
Pooja, Poonam, Radhika.

1311
01:08:58,891 --> 01:09:00,975
They had a different way of thinking.

1312
01:09:01,808 --> 01:09:04,725
- Kavita was a taekwondo champion, right?
- Yes.

1313
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:07,558
Nikki used to go to work.

1314
01:09:07,683 --> 01:09:08,766
Yeah.

1315
01:09:08,933 --> 01:09:11,183
And Vidhi had a love marriage
with a guy from another caste.

1316
01:09:11,266 --> 01:09:12,350
- Intercaste marriage, huh?
- Yes.

1317
01:09:12,433 --> 01:09:15,100
- Oh.
- Chitti was like them too,

1318
01:09:15,225 --> 01:09:16,725
she had so many dreams.

1319
01:09:16,808 --> 01:09:18,558
Not "had", she still HAS dreams.

1320
01:09:18,725 --> 01:09:21,225
Remember, he said he saw them alive?

1321
01:09:21,308 --> 01:09:22,766
They're bald, but they're alive.

1322
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:24,183
- Yes, Brother.
- Thank God.

1323
01:09:24,266 --> 01:09:25,766
If I close my eyes,

1324
01:09:25,933 --> 01:09:26,891
I'll see them again,

1325
01:09:27,016 --> 01:09:28,225
but I won't do that.

1326
01:09:28,433 --> 01:09:29,766
Perfect.

1327
01:09:30,016 --> 01:09:34,183
Alright, then from today,
you're our Sanjay for that hellish place.

1328
01:09:34,266 --> 01:09:35,475
Sanjay Dutt, you mean?

1329
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:37,558
- Hey, Sanju!
- Sanju!

1330
01:09:38,933 --> 01:09:40,808
Were you really trying for the IAS, huh?

1331
01:09:40,891 --> 01:09:42,100
I've been at it for two years.

1332
01:09:42,183 --> 01:09:43,100
That's another issue, I guess,
that I can't seem to clear it.

1333
01:09:43,183 --> 01:09:45,183
No, I mean the Sanjay
from the Mahabharata,

1334
01:09:45,516 --> 01:09:47,891
the one who helped
Dhritarashtra see the war

1335
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:49,225
through his divine vision!

1336
01:09:49,308 --> 01:09:51,975
Nah, I don't want to show
anyone any divine vision.

1337
01:09:52,058 --> 01:09:53,183
I just want to sleep.

1338
01:09:53,308 --> 01:09:54,350
Please, help me out.

1339
01:09:54,433 --> 01:09:56,725
This is no time to sleep, Jana.

1340
01:09:57,183 --> 01:09:59,683
It's time to wake up, got it?

1341
01:10:00,475 --> 01:10:02,183
And Brother Rudra,
it's time to wake everyone up as well.

1342
01:10:03,225 --> 01:10:05,350
When we used to write "O Stree,
come tomorrow" on the wall,

1343
01:10:05,516 --> 01:10:06,683
she would never show up.

1344
01:10:06,850 --> 01:10:09,308
Should we try "O Purush,
come tomorrow" now?

1345
01:10:09,641 --> 01:10:13,225
Sister, Stree read it
because she's a woman.

1346
01:10:13,891 --> 01:10:15,933
Do men ever read instructions?

1347
01:10:16,016 --> 01:10:19,103
They pee exactly
where it's explicitly written not to pee.

1348
01:10:19,183 --> 01:10:21,725
But this man is after
the modern girls, right?

1349
01:10:21,808 --> 01:10:23,725
And we're just very simple people.

1350
01:10:23,808 --> 01:10:25,100
Do you watch TV?

1351
01:10:25,183 --> 01:10:26,266
- Yes.
- Listen to music?

1352
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:27,808
- Yes.
- Are you on social media?

1353
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:29,145
- Yeah.
- Do you use WhatsApp?

1354
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,850
- Post your pics online?
- Yes.

1355
01:10:30,933 --> 01:10:32,808
Well, you're all on the list then.

1356
01:10:33,141 --> 01:10:34,433
But why's he even here, huh?

1357
01:10:34,516 --> 01:10:36,475
To pay his taxes.

1358
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:38,058
- What?
- Yes.

1359
01:10:38,475 --> 01:10:41,433
He is a departed ancestor of Chanderi.

1360
01:10:41,516 --> 01:10:45,016
He is back to reestablish his reign.

1361
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:45,600
Oh, I see.

1362
01:10:45,683 --> 01:10:47,266
We call upon the Ancestor of Chanderi!

1363
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:49,808
We call upon the powerful Headless!

1364
01:10:50,016 --> 01:10:51,850
We are here to pay homage to you.

1365
01:10:51,933 --> 01:10:56,145
Please come accept the water
we offer you

1366
01:10:56,225 --> 01:10:57,808
and forgive us.

1367
01:10:57,891 --> 01:11:01,348
And free this town from your wrath.

1368
01:11:02,933 --> 01:11:05,100
Brother Vicky,
its neckline's a bit too low, fix it up.

1369
01:11:05,225 --> 01:11:06,103
How's this?

1370
01:11:06,183 --> 01:11:07,183
Nah, higher.

1371
01:11:07,891 --> 01:11:08,475
Better?

1372
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,266
Will do.

1373
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:11,308
- Hey! This is a limit.
- We can fight about it later.

1374
01:11:11,391 --> 01:11:13,725
- What's up, Sushma?
- The back's too deep,

1375
01:11:13,808 --> 01:11:17,100
add some extra cloth there,
in the sleeves and waist.

1376
01:11:17,183 --> 01:11:19,350
But I made this Kareena Kapoor
style blouse just for you!

1377
01:11:19,433 --> 01:11:20,266
Like the one from "Bole Chudiyan".

1378
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:22,475
Fashion's not more important than my life.

1379
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,808
Cover up all the exposed areas quickly.

1380
01:11:23,891 --> 01:11:25,100
Like how Nirupa Roy wears them?

1381
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,391
Same to same.

1382
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,225
And I also have...

1383
01:11:28,308 --> 01:11:29,516
Yes--

1384
01:11:30,016 --> 01:11:31,100
Sister?

1385
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:32,433
Come with me.

1386
01:11:32,641 --> 01:11:34,391
Greetings, Sister.

1387
01:11:34,475 --> 01:11:36,475
To hell with your greetings.
Get up.

1388
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,808
I don't do this stuff.

1389
01:11:37,891 --> 01:11:39,266
I have never done "friendship".

1390
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:40,475
Who'd do "friendship" with you anyway?

1391
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,683
- Get up.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

1392
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:44,100
- Come with me without a fuss.
- Sister!

1393
01:11:44,183 --> 01:11:45,308
- Get him on the scooter.
- Where? Huh?

1394
01:11:45,391 --> 01:11:46,891
- Get him on the scooter, quick!
- On this.

1395
01:11:47,183 --> 01:11:48,933
I feel sandwiched. Can I drive it?

1396
01:11:50,141 --> 01:11:52,350
Look at him, having a blast.

1397
01:11:53,391 --> 01:11:55,183
Let him have his fun.

1398
01:11:55,433 --> 01:11:57,141
When else is he going to get
to have a good time, huh?

1399
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:00,975
Why are you dragging me into
these sketchy-looking ruins?

1400
01:12:01,058 --> 01:12:02,145
Just come with me,
I'll explain everything.

1401
01:12:02,225 --> 01:12:03,975
Wait a second, is this where you live?

1402
01:12:04,183 --> 01:12:06,141
Let's talk outside, Sister. Please...

1403
01:12:06,225 --> 01:12:07,433
- Come on.
- Sister--

1404
01:12:20,808 --> 01:12:22,016
Aunt Suneeta?

1405
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,350
Sister-in-law Anju? Neelam?

1406
01:12:24,016 --> 01:12:25,100
What's going on?

1407
01:12:25,266 --> 01:12:26,350
Why did you call me here?

1408
01:12:26,433 --> 01:12:28,891
Because you messed up our lives.

1409
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:29,641
Who? Me?

1410
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:30,933
- Yes.
- Yes, you.

1411
01:12:31,058 --> 01:12:32,266
What did I do?

1412
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:34,266
I was just altering some clothes.

1413
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,808
Why did you have to make
Stree leave Chanderi?

1414
01:12:37,891 --> 01:12:38,891
Oh, that!

1415
01:12:39,141 --> 01:12:40,225
Well,

1416
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,266
Ms. Stree would've kidnapped everyone,

1417
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:44,391
- so I was trying to save everyone's life.
- Not everyone,

1418
01:12:44,641 --> 01:12:46,391
just the men.

1419
01:12:46,475 --> 01:12:47,350
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1420
01:12:47,433 --> 01:12:50,308
All the men were like tamed cats,

1421
01:12:50,891 --> 01:12:53,141
and we women had so much freedom.

1422
01:12:53,225 --> 01:12:54,975
Then you made Stree leave

1423
01:12:55,058 --> 01:12:57,475
and that headless jerk took her place.

1424
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,850
Sorry, but I didn't know
he'd show up after Stree left.

1425
01:13:00,975 --> 01:13:02,891
It's his own deal,
I can't do anything about it.

1426
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:05,103
Look, you have to fight
that headless monster

1427
01:13:05,183 --> 01:13:07,016
and get our freedom back.

1428
01:13:07,141 --> 01:13:08,308
- Yeah, you're right.
- You'll have to do it.

1429
01:13:08,391 --> 01:13:09,475
- Who? Me?
- Yes, you.

1430
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,058
You have to get rid
of that monster for us.

1431
01:13:11,808 --> 01:13:13,103
Have you been hitting the weed or what?

1432
01:13:13,183 --> 01:13:14,225
- Huh?
- Hey!

1433
01:13:14,433 --> 01:13:15,850
Have you even seen him?

1434
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:17,850
You can't even see him
unless you crane your neck.

1435
01:13:18,641 --> 01:13:19,725
You know how massive he is?

1436
01:13:19,808 --> 01:13:20,308
How huge?

1437
01:13:20,391 --> 01:13:21,600
Do you have any idea how huge he is?

1438
01:13:21,683 --> 01:13:22,433
How huge?

1439
01:13:22,516 --> 01:13:24,433
Imagine Aamir Khan standing
on top of Mr. Bachchan,

1440
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:26,266
he'd only reach that monster's waist.

1441
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:28,266
- Oh God.
- Oh no.

1442
01:13:28,391 --> 01:13:30,183
And he's got no head attached.

1443
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:32,183
He just holds it in his hand.

1444
01:13:34,308 --> 01:13:36,391
And it keeps yelling all day.

1445
01:13:37,808 --> 01:13:40,516
How am I supposed to fight him
with this weak body of mine?

1446
01:13:41,433 --> 01:13:44,850
He'll crush me like a bug and eat me.

1447
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:46,975
Then you'll be looking for Vicky forever.

1448
01:13:47,475 --> 01:13:49,266
Just get someone else
to do the alterations.

1449
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,808
Vicky, my son,

1450
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:02,058
just like you made Stree leave,

1451
01:14:02,433 --> 01:14:05,891
you have to get rid
of this headless monster too.

1452
01:14:06,058 --> 01:14:07,058
Aunty...

1453
01:14:07,141 --> 01:14:08,641
We're counting on you.

1454
01:14:09,016 --> 01:14:10,516
- Please, don't beg.
- Only you can save us from him, son.

1455
01:14:10,641 --> 01:14:11,641
- Yes, Brother Vicky.
- Yes.

1456
01:14:11,725 --> 01:14:13,391
Long live Brother Vicky!

1457
01:14:13,641 --> 01:14:15,225
Long live Brother Vicky!

1458
01:14:15,308 --> 01:14:17,100
Long live the protector of Chanderi!

1459
01:14:17,183 --> 01:14:18,641
Long live the protector of Chanderi!

1460
01:14:18,766 --> 01:14:20,600
Long live the protector of Chanderi!

1461
01:14:20,683 --> 01:14:22,183
- Long live Brother Vicky!
- Hey! No!

1462
01:14:22,266 --> 01:14:23,850
Long live Brother Vicky!

1463
01:14:23,933 --> 01:14:25,933
Long live the protector of Chanderi!

1464
01:14:28,016 --> 01:14:30,850
Long live Brother Vicky!

1465
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:34,850
Long live Brother Vicky!

1466
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,391
I think the women are right on this one,
Vicky.

1467
01:14:37,475 --> 01:14:38,225
It's time for you to do or die.

1468
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:39,725
You want me dead or what?

1469
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:40,725
Vicky,

1470
01:14:42,808 --> 01:14:45,350
you should think about fighting
that monster instead of running away.

1471
01:14:45,433 --> 01:14:46,391
Huh?

1472
01:14:46,725 --> 01:14:47,683
Fight him?

1473
01:14:48,141 --> 01:14:50,683
Come on, how can I fight him?

1474
01:14:51,225 --> 01:14:53,391
Even you couldn't fight him
with that braid thing.

1475
01:14:54,016 --> 01:14:56,016
You forget what Mr. Shastri said?

1476
01:14:57,016 --> 01:14:59,308
In his eyes, love shines.

1477
01:15:00,391 --> 01:15:01,725
Right.

1478
01:15:02,308 --> 01:15:04,183
A true artist defined.

1479
01:15:04,975 --> 01:15:06,183
Vicky,

1480
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:08,308
you're the protector of this town.

1481
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,225
Bingo! She's right.

1482
01:15:12,433 --> 01:15:15,183
Every superhero has special powers.

1483
01:15:15,266 --> 01:15:17,058
Like Arjuna never missed his mark.

1484
01:15:17,225 --> 01:15:19,308
Like Bheem had his insane strength.

1485
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:24,141
Your strength is in your eyes,
the love in them.

1486
01:15:29,808 --> 01:15:31,266
Trust yourself.

1487
01:15:32,016 --> 01:15:34,016
If you could stop Stree,

1488
01:15:34,266 --> 01:15:36,266
you can beat this headless monster as well.

1489
01:15:36,516 --> 01:15:38,516
Look him in the eyes

1490
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,183
and stab him
with this dagger right in the chest.

1491
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:44,225
- That's it?
- That's it.

1492
01:15:47,058 --> 01:15:48,308
No way, no way!

1493
01:15:48,433 --> 01:15:49,850
How can I beat him?

1494
01:15:50,141 --> 01:15:52,516
What's wrong with these women?
Who do they think I am?

1495
01:15:52,641 --> 01:15:54,766
I'm just a tailor, not some superhero.

1496
01:15:54,891 --> 01:15:56,225
I've seen him.

1497
01:15:56,641 --> 01:15:57,850
- I can't do it.
- You can do it.

1498
01:15:57,933 --> 01:15:59,391
- No way, no way.
- You can do it, Vicky. You can.

1499
01:15:59,475 --> 01:16:00,391
She's right.

1500
01:16:00,475 --> 01:16:03,141
Only you can save Chanderi, Vicky.

1501
01:16:03,266 --> 01:16:04,350
- But...
- Yes.

1502
01:16:05,058 --> 01:16:06,058
You know,

1503
01:16:06,141 --> 01:16:08,850
I haven't slept well
since Chitti disappeared.

1504
01:16:10,141 --> 01:16:11,350
You can do it.

1505
01:16:15,516 --> 01:16:16,391
Nah.

1506
01:16:17,433 --> 01:16:18,475
Vicky...

1507
01:16:30,933 --> 01:16:32,350
But how do we get this headless
monster to show up?

1508
01:16:32,641 --> 01:16:34,600
Well, he was a womanizer.

1509
01:16:34,891 --> 01:16:36,766
He likes booze and dance shows.

1510
01:16:36,933 --> 01:16:39,225
So, we'll organize a dance show.

1511
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:40,516
But the problem is,

1512
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:43,391
who would agree to dance there?

1513
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:45,225
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's a huge issue.

1514
01:16:45,641 --> 01:16:46,725
No local girl would dare dance there.

1515
01:16:46,808 --> 01:16:47,891
They are all terrified.

1516
01:16:48,933 --> 01:16:50,225
I know a dancer.

1517
01:16:50,475 --> 01:16:51,975
She's not from Chanderi, an outsider.

1518
01:16:52,058 --> 01:16:55,391
Not her. Someone else.

1519
01:16:56,225 --> 01:16:57,225
- Who?
- But...

1520
01:16:57,308 --> 01:16:59,808
why would an outsider
risk her life for us?

1521
01:16:59,891 --> 01:17:00,808
Not for you.

1522
01:17:00,891 --> 01:17:01,600
Then?

1523
01:17:01,683 --> 01:17:02,641
For me.

1524
01:17:03,225 --> 01:17:04,516
- For you?!
- For you?!

1525
01:17:06,058 --> 01:17:07,225
For me.

1526
01:17:07,308 --> 01:17:10,183
- "Love is crazy and wonderful at the same time."
- Stop, stop, stop.

1527
01:17:10,266 --> 01:17:11,266
Perfect.

1528
01:17:12,016 --> 01:17:13,391
Come with me. Don't be scared.

1529
01:17:13,475 --> 01:17:16,225
Who's this dancer
that Brother Rudra knows, huh?

1530
01:17:16,891 --> 01:17:18,225
I would like to meet your boss.

1531
01:17:18,308 --> 01:17:19,600
And who do we have here?

1532
01:17:20,141 --> 01:17:21,266
He doesn't like to brag about himself.

1533
01:17:23,141 --> 01:17:26,058
Tell my flame her moth seeks her.

1534
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:28,266
Wait here.

1535
01:17:30,475 --> 01:17:31,975
- Brother Rudra?
- Hmm?

1536
01:17:32,183 --> 01:17:33,766
You dyed your beard, I see.

1537
01:17:34,225 --> 01:17:35,600
And you put on some fancy
'David-On' perfume too.

1538
01:17:35,683 --> 01:17:36,683
Nice.

1539
01:17:39,725 --> 01:17:43,266
"The flame tells the moth,"

1540
01:17:43,391 --> 01:17:47,103
"Go away, please,"

1541
01:17:47,183 --> 01:17:50,725
"You'll burn like me,"

1542
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:54,145
"Don't come here, please."

1543
01:17:54,225 --> 01:18:01,683
He doesn't listen for he desires to burn.

1544
01:18:02,308 --> 01:18:04,641
Aw, you haven't changed a bit,

1545
01:18:05,391 --> 01:18:07,141
my innocent prince.

1546
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,975
The same goes for you,

1547
01:18:10,308 --> 01:18:12,225
my beauty queen.

1548
01:18:12,933 --> 01:18:14,475
What have you been up to, Rudra?

1549
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,850
Well, you loved books

1550
01:18:16,975 --> 01:18:19,641
so I decided
to surround myself with books.

1551
01:18:20,266 --> 01:18:21,975
So, what are you now a junk collector?

1552
01:18:22,391 --> 01:18:23,725
Books and emotions
both have the same fate

1553
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:27,016
for those who don't know
their true worth consider it junk.

1554
01:18:27,225 --> 01:18:28,391
Jana? Bittu?

1555
01:18:28,475 --> 01:18:29,433
Go.

1556
01:18:29,891 --> 01:18:31,141
- Where?
- Where?

1557
01:18:31,308 --> 01:18:32,850
To jump into the well
and drown in shame.

1558
01:18:33,391 --> 01:18:34,516
Let's go.

1559
01:18:35,225 --> 01:18:37,141
I am here to ask for a favor, Shama.

1560
01:18:37,641 --> 01:18:40,058
You can ask for my life.

1561
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:48,183
I want you to do a dance performance
in Chanderi, please.

1562
01:18:48,266 --> 01:18:50,183
So, you are indeed here
to ask for my life.

1563
01:18:50,433 --> 01:18:52,100
You have my word, Shama,

1564
01:18:53,016 --> 01:18:54,975
no harm will come to you.

1565
01:18:56,141 --> 01:18:58,308
Ms. Shama, please?

1566
01:19:01,808 --> 01:19:03,100
Do this for me?

1567
01:19:05,266 --> 01:19:06,391
Fine.

1568
01:19:07,891 --> 01:19:10,391
Gone are the days when the moth
would die for the flame,

1569
01:19:11,141 --> 01:19:13,350
This flame will put her life at risk

1570
01:19:13,641 --> 01:19:15,516
for the moth today and change the game.

1571
01:19:17,183 --> 01:19:18,975
- Amazing.
- Well said.

1572
01:19:19,475 --> 01:19:21,391
Go tell everyone in Chanderi.

1573
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,641
Won't you come along?

1574
01:19:22,725 --> 01:19:25,183
No, I'll come with her.

1575
01:19:25,308 --> 01:19:27,641
- This is not right, Brother Rudra.
- Okay, perfect.

1576
01:19:27,725 --> 01:19:28,641
- Let's go.
- But...

1577
01:19:28,725 --> 01:19:30,100
Thank you.

1578
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:36,016
"Just marvel from afar,
for you can't touch this star."

1579
01:19:36,766 --> 01:19:39,891
"For you can't touch this star."

1580
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:41,350
She has come for real.

1581
01:19:43,016 --> 01:19:44,266
My Shama.

1582
01:19:51,433 --> 01:19:59,433
"Give your arms a rest, my love."

1583
01:19:59,725 --> 01:20:08,016
"Give your arms a rest, my love."

1584
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:16,103
"Behold this beauty with your
eyes tonight requests your dove."

1585
01:20:16,183 --> 01:20:25,016
"Behold this beauty with your
eyes tonight requests your dove."

1586
01:20:25,183 --> 01:20:29,975
"Take my life if you so desire,
my darling."

1587
01:20:30,183 --> 01:20:34,145
"For my ruin is certain tonight,
my sweetheart."

1588
01:20:34,225 --> 01:20:38,266
"Take my life if you so desire,
my darling."

1589
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:42,475
"For my ruin is certain tonight,
my sweetheart."

1590
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:46,433
Vicky, where is she?

1591
01:20:46,516 --> 01:20:48,475
She must be stuck somewhere,
that poor thing.

1592
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,850
Damn it.

1593
01:20:55,308 --> 01:21:03,850
"My darling,
try to see the delicacy of the scene."

1594
01:21:03,975 --> 01:21:11,850
"You cannot purchase
a lady's consent I mean."

1595
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:20,225
"You cannot purchase
a lady's consent I mean."

1596
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:23,183
"Don't feel so proud,"

1597
01:21:23,308 --> 01:21:28,600
"My love,"

1598
01:21:29,475 --> 01:21:31,183
See if you can figure out
if that headless monster is around.

1599
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:32,725
I'm not sure if I can manage that,
to be honest.

1600
01:21:32,891 --> 01:21:35,725
- Give it a try, at least give it a shot.
- Alright, I'll give it a go.

1601
01:21:46,891 --> 01:21:49,145
"--eyes tonight requests your dove."

1602
01:21:49,225 --> 01:21:51,433
Brother Rudra,
he's somewhere nearby. He's close by.

1603
01:21:51,516 --> 01:21:55,641
"Take my life if you so desire,
my darling."

1604
01:21:55,725 --> 01:21:56,433
Vicky!

1605
01:21:56,516 --> 01:22:00,145
"For my ruin is certain tonight,
my sweetheart."

1606
01:22:00,225 --> 01:22:04,225
"Take my life if you so desire,
my darling."

1607
01:22:04,308 --> 01:22:05,891
"For my ruin is--"

1608
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:07,725
What happened?

1609
01:22:09,225 --> 01:22:10,225
Why's the power out?

1610
01:22:10,308 --> 01:22:12,225
Vicky! Bittu!

1611
01:22:12,516 --> 01:22:13,850
Brother Rudra! What do we do?

1612
01:22:13,933 --> 01:22:14,891
Quick, hide Ms. Shama!

1613
01:22:14,975 --> 01:22:15,475
Okay.

1614
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,183
Surround her. Surround her.

1615
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,058
Surround her, hurry!

1616
01:22:22,516 --> 01:22:23,433
Hey!

1617
01:22:23,516 --> 01:22:25,683
- He's here. He's here.
- Hide.

1618
01:22:50,391 --> 01:22:51,103
Bittu?

1619
01:22:51,183 --> 01:22:52,100
Yeah?

1620
01:22:52,225 --> 01:22:53,641
Make sure Ms. Shama stays protected,
alright?

1621
01:22:54,516 --> 01:22:55,308
Okay.

1622
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:58,058
Be careful, Vicky.

1623
01:23:02,516 --> 01:23:03,600
Vicky...

1624
01:23:05,183 --> 01:23:06,641
Vicky's going over there.
He's walking towards him.

1625
01:23:06,725 --> 01:23:08,058
He'll be fine.

1626
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:10,058
He's the protector of this town.

1627
01:23:10,183 --> 01:23:11,558
Vicky, my friend...

1628
01:23:12,016 --> 01:23:13,058
Daddy...

1629
01:23:14,891 --> 01:23:16,683
'Look him in the eyes'

1630
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:19,100
'and stab him
with this dagger right in the chest.'

1631
01:23:19,266 --> 01:23:20,266
Where are you?

1632
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,183
We'll have to do something,
Brother Rudra.

1633
01:23:22,266 --> 01:23:23,683
There's nothing we can do.

1634
01:23:23,766 --> 01:23:25,683
Whatever needs to be done,
Vicky will take care of it.

1635
01:23:25,766 --> 01:23:26,808
Vicky...

1636
01:23:31,391 --> 01:23:32,225
Where...

1637
01:23:32,683 --> 01:23:33,975
where's your head?

1638
01:23:34,933 --> 01:23:37,183
You were supposed to look into my eyes.

1639
01:23:38,058 --> 01:23:38,975
You should leave.

1640
01:23:39,433 --> 01:23:40,975
I'll kill you.

1641
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:42,350
You need to leave.

1642
01:23:44,433 --> 01:23:46,058
I'll really kill you.

1643
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:47,766
I'm the protector of Chanderi.

1644
01:23:49,141 --> 01:23:50,516
You...

1645
01:23:52,516 --> 01:23:55,225
Brother Rudra, Vicky...!
Brother Rudra, let me go!

1646
01:24:25,225 --> 01:24:27,391
No, no, no!

1647
01:24:28,850 --> 01:24:31,270
Help!

1648
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:32,641
Momma!

1649
01:24:32,725 --> 01:24:34,433
Help!

1650
01:24:35,266 --> 01:24:36,975
Help!

1651
01:24:46,391 --> 01:24:48,183
Let me go.

1652
01:24:53,641 --> 01:24:56,058
I have no reason to live anymore.
He took Shama away.

1653
01:24:56,141 --> 01:24:57,641
Don't say that, Brother Rudra.

1654
01:24:58,683 --> 01:25:00,100
Oh God!

1655
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:01,475
No!

1656
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,475
Brother Rudra!

1657
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,058
- Go.
- Are you okay?

1658
01:25:07,016 --> 01:25:07,808
Vicky...?

1659
01:25:07,891 --> 01:25:08,808
Vicky...?

1660
01:25:09,225 --> 01:25:10,641
Get up, get up.

1661
01:25:12,225 --> 01:25:13,475
What's wrong with you?

1662
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:14,725
What's wrong?

1663
01:25:16,933 --> 01:25:18,350
I...I don't know.

1664
01:25:19,016 --> 01:25:20,600
I was about to stab him
with the dagger...

1665
01:25:20,683 --> 01:25:21,145
Okay.

1666
01:25:21,225 --> 01:25:22,641
Then he brought his head forward

1667
01:25:22,975 --> 01:25:24,225
and everything got foggy.

1668
01:25:24,308 --> 01:25:25,891
I know, I saw.

1669
01:25:26,808 --> 01:25:28,350
Bittu? Where's Bittu?

1670
01:25:50,975 --> 01:25:51,933
- Bittu!
- Bittu!

1671
01:25:52,016 --> 01:25:53,266
Why aren't you answering our calls?

1672
01:25:54,183 --> 01:25:55,641
What are you doing here?

1673
01:25:55,975 --> 01:25:57,433
I've had a realization
and my eyes have been opened.

1674
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,516
No, your eyes have changed.

1675
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:02,225
You should change too.

1676
01:26:02,308 --> 01:26:03,145
Or else...

1677
01:26:03,225 --> 01:26:04,103
Or else what?

1678
01:26:04,183 --> 01:26:05,308
What will you do?

1679
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:07,808
Or you'll get beaten up
just like this drum.

1680
01:26:09,933 --> 01:26:12,266
That headless monster seems
to have them under his control.

1681
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:13,308
Yes.

1682
01:26:15,016 --> 01:26:16,933
No, your eyes seem to be fine.

1683
01:26:20,558 --> 01:26:22,350
He has divine powers.

1684
01:26:22,933 --> 01:26:24,433
Opposing him

1685
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,975
is like trying to throw sand over the sun.

1686
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:31,058
That poor guy lost his head.

1687
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,433
He lost his head.

1688
01:26:34,141 --> 01:26:38,266
Yet he's protecting our culture.

1689
01:26:39,475 --> 01:26:41,808
The headless man is here!

1690
01:26:41,891 --> 01:26:44,308
The headless man is here!

1691
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:48,975
All the females should stay home.

1692
01:26:49,058 --> 01:26:52,225
The headless man can show up
anywhere anytime.

1693
01:26:52,725 --> 01:26:55,808
All the females should stay home.

1694
01:26:55,891 --> 01:26:59,141
The headless man can show up
anywhere anytime.

1695
01:26:59,683 --> 01:27:01,058
Vicky...

1696
01:27:01,558 --> 01:27:02,766
You?

1697
01:27:03,558 --> 01:27:05,558
Are you okay?

1698
01:27:06,725 --> 01:27:08,058
Where have you been all this time?

1699
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:10,058
Where did you disappear
to at the last moment?

1700
01:27:10,766 --> 01:27:13,433
That monster has like over
a hundred men acting just like him.

1701
01:27:13,725 --> 01:27:15,308
And he took Ms. Shama with him too.

1702
01:27:15,516 --> 01:27:16,725
Now you show up here.

1703
01:27:17,516 --> 01:27:18,391
Where were you?

1704
01:27:18,475 --> 01:27:19,725
Why didn't you come there?

1705
01:27:20,141 --> 01:27:24,183
I... I was trying to get
to where that headless monster came from.

1706
01:27:25,266 --> 01:27:26,183
Why?

1707
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:30,933
I thought I'd try and free
all the girls while he was busy here.

1708
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:33,516
But I couldn't get in there.

1709
01:27:35,598 --> 01:27:36,932
You are lying, aren't you?

1710
01:27:37,682 --> 01:27:39,015
Trust me.

1711
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:41,182
How do I trust you?

1712
01:27:41,473 --> 01:27:42,848
I really don't know much about you.

1713
01:27:42,932 --> 01:27:44,598
I don't even know your name
or where you live.

1714
01:27:44,682 --> 01:27:46,307
You just come and go as you please.

1715
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:48,307
I have no idea about your family
or what they do.

1716
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:49,932
Are you a mountain person
or a beach person?

1717
01:27:50,057 --> 01:27:51,682
Vegetarian or non-vegetarian?
What's your past?

1718
01:27:51,765 --> 01:27:53,723
Why did you take Stree's braid?
Why did you disappear from the bus?

1719
01:27:53,807 --> 01:27:55,098
I'm clueless about all of it.

1720
01:27:55,598 --> 01:27:57,182
But you seem to know everything about me.

1721
01:27:57,557 --> 01:27:59,098
You know I'm Vicky, I live with my dad,

1722
01:27:59,182 --> 01:28:01,265
I don't have a mom,
I'm a ladies tailor and I studied home science.

1723
01:28:01,348 --> 01:28:03,057
I love the mountains and I love you--

1724
01:28:06,223 --> 01:28:07,265
I am a crazy fool.

1725
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:10,765
Look, Vicky,
I want to tell you everything about myself.

1726
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:13,265
I've tried many times but couldn't.

1727
01:28:13,348 --> 01:28:14,723
Now is your chance, so tell me.

1728
01:28:15,348 --> 01:28:16,682
There's no better time than right now.

1729
01:28:16,765 --> 01:28:18,140
I'm all ears.

1730
01:28:19,015 --> 01:28:20,682
You won't be able to hear it.

1731
01:28:21,765 --> 01:28:23,932
Whatever relationship we have,

1732
01:28:24,515 --> 01:28:27,098
it'll end the day I tell you the truth.

1733
01:28:29,682 --> 01:28:30,890
Relationship?

1734
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:33,390
What relationship do we even have, anyway?

1735
01:28:34,223 --> 01:28:38,307
It's like a firefly and light,

1736
01:28:38,848 --> 01:28:40,390
a flower and dew,

1737
01:28:40,515 --> 01:28:42,182
a deer and musk -

1738
01:28:42,765 --> 01:28:44,848
a bond between souls.

1739
01:28:47,307 --> 01:28:49,473
It's beyond your understanding.

1740
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:52,682
It's beyond time itself.

1741
01:28:53,765 --> 01:28:55,265
Woah, beyond time?

1742
01:28:57,057 --> 01:28:58,307
Vicky...

1743
01:28:59,765 --> 01:29:00,723
Vicky!

1744
01:29:01,515 --> 01:29:02,932
- What is it?
- Come down, quick!

1745
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:05,140
Coming!

1746
01:29:05,348 --> 01:29:06,848
- I'll die. I'll die.
- What are you doing?

1747
01:29:06,932 --> 01:29:08,598
- Take care of yourself...
- What is it? What's wrong?

1748
01:29:09,057 --> 01:29:10,515
- What happened?
- Look at his condition.

1749
01:29:10,723 --> 01:29:11,723
You...

1750
01:29:12,265 --> 01:29:13,182
You decided to show up today?

1751
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:14,682
- Where have you been, Sister?
- Jana...

1752
01:29:14,765 --> 01:29:16,348
- Do you know what happened yesterday?
- Jana...

1753
01:29:16,932 --> 01:29:18,515
We had a heart-to-heart chat.

1754
01:29:18,598 --> 01:29:19,598
It's not her fault.

1755
01:29:19,682 --> 01:29:20,390
Brother Rudra, what's wrong?

1756
01:29:20,473 --> 01:29:21,723
Are you having a stroke?

1757
01:29:21,807 --> 01:29:23,182
- No... no.
- Are you feeling okay?

1758
01:29:23,307 --> 01:29:24,848
- What happened?
- I'm disturbed,

1759
01:29:25,015 --> 01:29:26,473
really disturbed.

1760
01:29:27,265 --> 01:29:30,182
There's like a volcano
of emotions inside me.

1761
01:29:30,265 --> 01:29:31,890
I feel so guilty and ashamed.

1762
01:29:32,265 --> 01:29:33,223
Shama...

1763
01:29:34,057 --> 01:29:34,723
No.

1764
01:29:35,432 --> 01:29:37,307
I had promised her

1765
01:29:37,515 --> 01:29:39,223
no harm would come to her.

1766
01:29:40,057 --> 01:29:41,807
- And I'll keep that promise.
- Okay.

1767
01:29:42,723 --> 01:29:44,932
Even if the moth has
to sacrifice himself today,

1768
01:29:45,598 --> 01:29:48,015
he will reignite the flame.

1769
01:29:48,098 --> 01:29:50,390
- Don't say that.
- Don't get all dramatic on us, Brother Rudra.

1770
01:29:50,515 --> 01:29:52,098
Show him what you came here for.

1771
01:29:52,182 --> 01:29:53,848
What? I had come to show him my pain.

1772
01:29:53,932 --> 01:29:55,765
Did you forget about that document?
He's impossible.

1773
01:29:55,848 --> 01:29:56,682
- What is this?
- This...

1774
01:29:56,890 --> 01:29:59,932
I got a link that might help us solve
the headless monster's puzzle.

1775
01:30:00,057 --> 01:30:00,932
Have a look at this.

1776
01:30:01,098 --> 01:30:03,515
The person who sent the warning

1777
01:30:03,723 --> 01:30:08,182
knew the monster would
show up after Stree left.

1778
01:30:08,307 --> 01:30:12,473
He might have more information
on that headless monster.

1779
01:30:12,557 --> 01:30:14,682
He might also know

1780
01:30:14,765 --> 01:30:17,182
how to get to where the monster lives.

1781
01:30:17,265 --> 01:30:19,807
Well, whatever you need to find out,
you better hurry.

1782
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:22,223
Otherwise, this monster's going
to set Chanderi back 200 years.

1783
01:30:22,307 --> 01:30:23,640
Brother Rudra, I asked you

1784
01:30:23,807 --> 01:30:25,182
to find out who sent that letter.

1785
01:30:25,265 --> 01:30:29,140
I couldn't find that out,
but I found out where it was from.

1786
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:31,557
Look at this stamp.

1787
01:30:32,432 --> 01:30:33,682
- Give them the...
- Here.

1788
01:30:34,848 --> 01:30:37,348
- Men--
- Mental Asylum, Bhopal.

1789
01:30:37,557 --> 01:30:39,143
Give me your hair!

1790
01:30:39,223 --> 01:30:40,807
Give it to me! Give it to me!

1791
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:43,307
Baldy is pulling my hair!

1792
01:30:43,390 --> 01:30:45,098
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1793
01:30:45,182 --> 01:30:46,390
Give me your hair!

1794
01:30:50,932 --> 01:30:53,057
Chanderi?
Is anyone from Chanderi out here?

1795
01:30:53,557 --> 01:30:54,640
No, nothing.

1796
01:30:55,598 --> 01:30:57,515
Is anyone from Chanderi out here?

1797
01:30:59,140 --> 01:30:59,848
Protect your hair.

1798
01:30:59,932 --> 01:31:00,807
Anyone?

1799
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:02,932
Is anyone from Chanderi out here?

1800
01:31:03,098 --> 01:31:04,223
He is coming.

1801
01:31:04,307 --> 01:31:05,723
- He is coming?
- He is coming.

1802
01:31:05,807 --> 01:31:11,140
Stand up, show respect and be alert.

1803
01:31:12,515 --> 01:31:14,765
King of kings,

1804
01:31:15,265 --> 01:31:17,598
Emperor of emperors,

1805
01:31:17,807 --> 01:31:21,515
The defender and decider of the faith,

1806
01:31:21,765 --> 01:31:26,182
King of India the Great,
Get locked up before it's too late,

1807
01:31:26,432 --> 01:31:29,182
Husband to Mumtaz Mahal,

1808
01:31:29,807 --> 01:31:32,348
Builder of the Taj Mahal,

1809
01:31:32,515 --> 01:31:34,640
For now and forever

1810
01:31:35,057 --> 01:31:39,057
Shah Jahan is blessing us
with his presence!

1811
01:31:39,682 --> 01:31:41,265
Let's get started.

1812
01:31:43,307 --> 01:31:44,307
Hey!

1813
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:46,515
He's from Udaybhan's family.

1814
01:31:47,307 --> 01:31:48,473
Look at him.

1815
01:31:48,807 --> 01:31:49,723
Minister!

1816
01:31:49,848 --> 01:31:50,765
Your Highness.

1817
01:31:51,223 --> 01:31:53,307
What's the update
on Taj Mahal's construction?

1818
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:55,390
There's a shortage of marbles,
Your Highness.

1819
01:31:55,515 --> 01:31:56,932
You need to hurry.

1820
01:31:57,348 --> 01:32:01,515
My wife's soul will keep "roaming"
till we don't finish its construction.

1821
01:32:01,723 --> 01:32:02,932
Astrologer,

1822
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:07,015
tell me - whose body does
my wife's soul possess these days?

1823
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:11,682
In him, Your Highness.

1824
01:32:11,765 --> 01:32:13,390
- What are you doing, Brother Rudra?
- Her soul is in him.

1825
01:32:13,515 --> 01:32:15,473
- Vicky?
- Yes, it's in him.

1826
01:32:15,557 --> 01:32:16,223
Come on.

1827
01:32:16,307 --> 01:32:17,557
No, it's not.

1828
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:18,765
It's not.

1829
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:22,140
What is he looking at?

1830
01:32:23,473 --> 01:32:24,598
Mumtaz,

1831
01:32:25,348 --> 01:32:28,807
couldn't you find anyone better
than this mushroom of a person?

1832
01:32:29,390 --> 01:32:31,057
What's wrong with your taste?

1833
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:32,390
Well, I had COVID, you know.

1834
01:32:32,473 --> 01:32:33,682
Good Lord!

1835
01:32:34,598 --> 01:32:35,932
Come here, I'll give you the vaccine!

1836
01:32:36,057 --> 01:32:37,102
- What will you give me?
- Go.

1837
01:32:37,182 --> 01:32:38,348
- Go, go, go.
- Go on.

1838
01:32:38,432 --> 01:32:39,390
Come here.

1839
01:32:39,515 --> 01:32:41,848
Not there, sit on my lap.
That's where you'll get it.

1840
01:32:41,932 --> 01:32:43,682
- He's going to give me a vaccine.
- Just take it, man.

1841
01:32:43,765 --> 01:32:44,932
How are you, my Momo?

1842
01:32:45,057 --> 01:32:45,807
Momo?

1843
01:32:45,890 --> 01:32:48,182
I guess that's Mumtaz's pet name.

1844
01:32:48,348 --> 01:32:50,223
Tell me,
where did you go leaving me all alone?

1845
01:32:50,307 --> 01:32:51,223
Chanderi.

1846
01:32:51,307 --> 01:32:53,390
She went to Chanderi,
I mean, I went to Chanderi.

1847
01:32:53,515 --> 01:32:55,598
That place is in big trouble.

1848
01:32:55,682 --> 01:32:58,890
The headless monster
has started causing havoc then?

1849
01:33:01,557 --> 01:33:02,932
You knew about it?

1850
01:33:06,473 --> 01:33:07,598
Dismissed!

1851
01:33:10,890 --> 01:33:12,307
Dismissed!

1852
01:33:14,557 --> 01:33:16,682
Leave.
Please leave.

1853
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:18,223
Everyone, please leave.

1854
01:33:18,515 --> 01:33:19,348
Yes.

1855
01:33:19,473 --> 01:33:20,557
Let's go.

1856
01:33:20,807 --> 01:33:22,098
Where are you going, Momo?

1857
01:33:22,265 --> 01:33:23,265
You stay here.

1858
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:24,723
Don't you dare!

1859
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:27,098
Don't you dare call me Momo
or kiss me anywhere!

1860
01:33:27,182 --> 01:33:29,723
You wretched woman!

1861
01:33:33,473 --> 01:33:35,848
Calm down, Your Highness.
Calm down.

1862
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:38,057
I'm just saying

1863
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:40,932
the Iss Mahal will cost a fortune.

1864
01:33:41,348 --> 01:33:44,640
Why not build a public toilet instead?

1865
01:33:44,723 --> 01:33:46,848
A public toilet made of marble?
That's just weird.

1866
01:33:46,932 --> 01:33:49,182
People will come and pee
all over our symbol of love.

1867
01:33:49,262 --> 01:33:50,682
Ugh, gross.

1868
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:53,307
Do you love me, my dear?

1869
01:33:54,598 --> 01:33:55,807
Yes, I do.

1870
01:33:55,890 --> 01:33:57,307
Then tell me,

1871
01:33:57,432 --> 01:34:00,140
what do you know
about that headless monster?

1872
01:34:06,682 --> 01:34:08,682
That headless monster
is an ancestor of mine.

1873
01:34:10,557 --> 01:34:12,765
I have his foul blood in my veins.

1874
01:34:12,848 --> 01:34:16,682
That's why you tore those pages
from the Chanderi Puran.

1875
01:34:16,765 --> 01:34:20,390
But I sent them back with a warning.

1876
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:22,473
- He will come back.
- Yes.

1877
01:34:23,307 --> 01:34:24,765
He will come back.

1878
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:26,723
But you didn't tell us

1879
01:34:27,015 --> 01:34:29,557
how to deal with this monster
when he comes back.

1880
01:34:30,182 --> 01:34:32,473
You just left us to fend for ourselves
with just a warning.

1881
01:34:33,098 --> 01:34:34,348
Your Highness,

1882
01:34:35,182 --> 01:34:36,932
you gave us the warning,
didn't you? So tell us,

1883
01:34:37,598 --> 01:34:39,807
how can we defeat this headless monster.

1884
01:34:40,932 --> 01:34:44,890
My Queen, I would've gone myself,

1885
01:34:45,765 --> 01:34:47,473
to defeat him but

1886
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:50,640
I keep slipping off elephants these days

1887
01:34:51,223 --> 01:34:52,807
because of balancing issues.

1888
01:34:52,890 --> 01:34:54,265
Listen,

1889
01:34:54,682 --> 01:34:57,265
that monster has kidnapped girls
from our town,

1890
01:34:57,682 --> 01:34:59,932
including Chitti and our Shama.

1891
01:35:00,057 --> 01:35:01,390
Hey... She's mine.

1892
01:35:01,515 --> 01:35:03,682
- My Shama.
- Yeah, yeah, his Shama.

1893
01:35:03,765 --> 01:35:06,182
He kidnapped her right
in front of everyone.

1894
01:35:06,598 --> 01:35:09,057
He's even messed with the minds
of every single man in Chanderi.

1895
01:35:09,265 --> 01:35:10,682
They've all gone completely bonkers.

1896
01:35:11,723 --> 01:35:13,807
If you know anything that can help us,
please tell us.

1897
01:35:14,890 --> 01:35:16,723
Otherwise, our whole town
of Chanderi is doomed.

1898
01:35:18,557 --> 01:35:20,140
Please, my darling.

1899
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:22,682
You have to help us,
for the sake of our love!

1900
01:35:26,182 --> 01:35:29,390
In a realm that dwells
in the shadows of the town.

1901
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:32,348
He can be dealt with only
in his home ground.

1902
01:35:32,432 --> 01:35:36,307
Neither by a human nor an animal,
it can be reached.

1903
01:35:36,598 --> 01:35:38,723
Neither by a man nor a woman
it can be breached,

1904
01:35:38,890 --> 01:35:41,890
To enter in you have
to be an equal part of each.

1905
01:35:42,182 --> 01:35:44,515
But he won't stop nor will his havoc

1906
01:35:44,723 --> 01:35:46,807
Until he does not get what he wants -

1907
01:35:47,223 --> 01:35:50,390
A sacrifice!

1908
01:35:50,515 --> 01:35:51,682
Sacrifice who?

1909
01:35:51,807 --> 01:35:53,052
Sacrifice a female.

1910
01:35:53,432 --> 01:35:55,057
Sacrifice Stree!

1911
01:35:57,057 --> 01:35:58,223
Sacrifice a female.

1912
01:35:59,182 --> 01:36:01,473
But if Ms. Stree's not there,
then who's he going sacrifice?

1913
01:36:01,557 --> 01:36:02,682
He's got a whole bunch
of females with him -

1914
01:36:02,765 --> 01:36:04,307
He's got my Shama, Chitti,
and other females too.

1915
01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:05,765
- Oh shit!
- Oh no!

1916
01:36:06,182 --> 01:36:07,932
Today's the last day
of the Mahapooja festivities.

1917
01:36:08,098 --> 01:36:10,515
If we don't do something today,
he's going sacrifice all those women.

1918
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:13,765
We have to find a way to get into
his house, no matter what it takes.

1919
01:36:14,348 --> 01:36:16,223
So what do we know about
this headless monster?

1920
01:36:16,598 --> 01:36:18,182
That it doesn't have a head.

1921
01:36:18,390 --> 01:36:19,473
Nice work.

1922
01:36:19,807 --> 01:36:21,765
Let's make him an IAS officer right away!

1923
01:36:21,848 --> 01:36:23,390
- Thank you, Brother Rudra.
- Shut up.

1924
01:36:24,682 --> 01:36:26,057
What a useless person.

1925
01:36:26,723 --> 01:36:28,598
He can influence people.

1926
01:36:28,682 --> 01:36:30,682
He's changed everyone's minds.
He has influenced them.

1927
01:36:30,807 --> 01:36:31,765
What do you mean?

1928
01:36:31,848 --> 01:36:34,098
So this headless monster
is basically an influencer.

1929
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:36,682
He wants to grow his followers.

1930
01:36:36,890 --> 01:36:39,015
His powers are in his body,

1931
01:36:39,265 --> 01:36:41,307
but it's controlled by the head.

1932
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:43,807
So if we separate the head from the body,

1933
01:36:43,890 --> 01:36:44,932
the head will be left helpless.

1934
01:36:45,057 --> 01:36:47,223
Then we can quietly go

1935
01:36:47,682 --> 01:36:48,932
and chop it off.

1936
01:36:49,057 --> 01:36:50,932
No, not we, Brother, you have to do it.

1937
01:36:51,057 --> 01:36:52,307
You're the protector of this town.

1938
01:36:52,723 --> 01:36:53,432
Yes, right.

1939
01:36:53,515 --> 01:36:57,640
But that's only possible if we reach
the hellish place where he lives.

1940
01:36:57,765 --> 01:36:59,307
And nobody can go there.

1941
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:01,057
Neither humans nor animals.

1942
01:37:01,682 --> 01:37:03,682
Hey, I've got another idea!

1943
01:37:03,765 --> 01:37:04,348
Plan B.

1944
01:37:04,432 --> 01:37:05,473
We haven't even made Plan A yet
and you're already onto Plan B?

1945
01:37:05,557 --> 01:37:06,557
No, Vicky, what I meant was...

1946
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:08,265
- Stop.
- Stop it.

1947
01:37:08,515 --> 01:37:10,557
Remember what he said.

1948
01:37:10,723 --> 01:37:12,807
Neither by a man nor a woman
can it be breached,

1949
01:37:12,890 --> 01:37:15,682
To enter, you have to have
equal parts of each.

1950
01:37:16,057 --> 01:37:17,390
Neither by a man nor a woman
can it be breached,

1951
01:37:17,473 --> 01:37:18,932
To enter,
you have to have equal parts of each.

1952
01:37:19,848 --> 01:37:20,932
Hey...

1953
01:37:21,348 --> 01:37:22,223
You have to have equal parts of each.

1954
01:37:22,307 --> 01:37:23,473
Let's send Jana then.

1955
01:37:23,807 --> 01:37:25,015
What do you mean, Vicky?

1956
01:37:25,098 --> 01:37:26,307
Are you saying I'm half man
and half woman?

1957
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:27,932
- Is that what you're trying to say?
- No, no, no,

1958
01:37:28,057 --> 01:37:29,390
I've seen Jana when he was a kid.

1959
01:37:29,473 --> 01:37:30,265
What did you see?

1960
01:37:30,348 --> 01:37:31,265
What did you see, Brother Rudra?

1961
01:37:31,348 --> 01:37:32,473
I have a lot of respect for you.

1962
01:37:32,557 --> 01:37:33,890
That's no way to talk to me.

1963
01:37:34,015 --> 01:37:35,265
I came all the way
from Delhi just for you guys.

1964
01:37:35,348 --> 01:37:36,515
I even died for three minutes.

1965
01:37:36,598 --> 01:37:38,143
That loafer kept calling me Momo,

1966
01:37:38,223 --> 01:37:39,057
but you didn't stop him.

1967
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:40,182
- Jana!
- Sister, did you hear what he's saying?

1968
01:37:40,265 --> 01:37:40,848
What?

1969
01:37:40,932 --> 01:37:42,598
You still have Stree's
lingering effect in you.

1970
01:37:42,723 --> 01:37:44,182
So you have a small
Feminine part inside you. That's why...

1971
01:37:44,265 --> 01:37:45,682
You're saying I have female
parts inside me!

1972
01:37:45,765 --> 01:37:47,723
Why don't you just say
you want me to die?!

1973
01:37:47,807 --> 01:37:48,723
SILENCE!

1974
01:37:49,893 --> 01:37:51,723
Half man, half woman,

1975
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:54,723
I think he was talking
about Ardhanarishvara.

1976
01:37:56,057 --> 01:37:56,973
I see.

1977
01:37:57,057 --> 01:37:58,473
Oh, Ardhanarishvara,

1978
01:37:59,057 --> 01:38:00,848
the union of Lord Shiva and Shakti.

1979
01:38:01,057 --> 01:38:05,515
Neither a female nor a male can break
the reign of the headless monster.

1980
01:38:05,682 --> 01:38:08,598
For that, a man and a woman
will have to become one.

1981
01:38:08,682 --> 01:38:09,598
But how?

1982
01:38:09,682 --> 01:38:10,932
Leave that to me.

1983
01:38:11,057 --> 01:38:13,682
You just think about cutting off his head.

1984
01:38:14,515 --> 01:38:16,348
In one strike.

1985
01:38:16,848 --> 01:38:18,140
One strike?

1986
01:38:45,682 --> 01:38:48,182
May I have your kind attention, please!

1987
01:38:48,348 --> 01:38:51,515
The upcoming Mahapooja's veneration

1988
01:38:51,598 --> 01:38:56,640
will be conducted solely by men.

1989
01:39:00,807 --> 01:39:06,057
Women are kindly requested
to remain at home for this event.

1990
01:39:18,765 --> 01:39:19,640
Perfect.

1991
01:39:19,723 --> 01:39:21,515
Now you look like a real prince indeed.

1992
01:39:32,015 --> 01:39:33,265
Vicky?

1993
01:39:36,182 --> 01:39:37,848
Where are you all going,
leaving me by myself?

1994
01:39:38,515 --> 01:39:40,098
You came here to save those girls,
didn't you?

1995
01:39:40,473 --> 01:39:41,765
- You won't be able to save them.
- Hey...

1996
01:39:41,890 --> 01:39:43,015
It's just not possible.

1997
01:39:44,015 --> 01:39:45,557
- Go on.
- Go.

1998
01:39:45,723 --> 01:39:46,890
Watch your step.

1999
01:39:47,265 --> 01:39:49,098
Hey Bittu...

2000
01:39:49,182 --> 01:39:51,015
- Cut it out, Bittu.
- Hey!

2001
01:39:51,098 --> 01:39:52,348
- No.
- Walk properly.

2002
01:39:52,473 --> 01:39:53,848
Why did we even bring him along?

2003
01:39:53,973 --> 01:39:57,015
Remember we had brought you
along even when you were growling?

2004
01:39:57,098 --> 01:39:58,432
- Yeah.
- He's our friend.

2005
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:00,890
And anyway,
we need one of his men with us.

2006
01:40:00,973 --> 01:40:01,890
Why is that?

2007
01:40:02,015 --> 01:40:03,473
What if we need to give
and take something?

2008
01:40:03,557 --> 01:40:04,640
- Yes.
- Give and take what?

2009
01:40:04,848 --> 01:40:06,140
And Jana,

2010
01:40:06,515 --> 01:40:09,182
if we take too long to get back then...

2011
01:40:09,848 --> 01:40:10,932
Then what? Kill him?

2012
01:40:11,015 --> 01:40:12,102
No, no, no!

2013
01:40:12,182 --> 01:40:14,102
Just handle it as you see fit.

2014
01:40:14,182 --> 01:40:16,723
- Okay, fine.
- You'll die! You'll die!

2015
01:40:16,807 --> 01:40:19,890
Brother Rudra, make him on the bed.
Just make him sit there.

2016
01:40:19,973 --> 01:40:21,473
You've lost all your manners, Bittu.

2017
01:40:21,932 --> 01:40:23,890
- What are you going to do, huh?
- Quiet.

2018
01:40:24,265 --> 01:40:26,057
Don't worry about him, Vicky.

2019
01:40:26,223 --> 01:40:28,140
Brother, when you go in,

2020
01:40:28,265 --> 01:40:30,182
no matter what happens,
don't be scared.

2021
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:32,140
I've got your back.

2022
01:40:32,307 --> 01:40:33,640
And I've got a Plan B.

2023
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:35,348
Spell out B for me, will you?

2024
01:40:35,848 --> 01:40:36,682
B?

2025
01:40:36,765 --> 01:40:37,890
- Yeah, B...
- B...

2026
01:40:38,890 --> 01:40:40,223
- Vicky!
- Yeah?

2027
01:40:41,182 --> 01:40:42,640
- We need to hurry.
- Right.

2028
01:40:42,723 --> 01:40:44,182
I'm ready. I'm ready.
Brother Rudra...

2029
01:40:44,265 --> 01:40:45,473
- Here.
- Yes.

2030
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:47,348
Go and be victorious.

2031
01:40:47,432 --> 01:40:49,348
Be the force with you.

2032
01:40:50,557 --> 01:40:53,098
Just let Shama know
I came here with you.

2033
01:40:53,182 --> 01:40:54,390
- Yeah, I'll let her know. I'll let her know.
- Vicky...

2034
01:40:54,473 --> 01:40:55,265
Vicky...

2035
01:40:56,223 --> 01:40:58,098
- Stop.
- Okay, now tell me what we need to do.

2036
01:40:59,057 --> 01:41:01,182
We have to go through this wall.

2037
01:41:02,098 --> 01:41:03,265
- This wall?
- Hmm.

2038
01:41:04,473 --> 01:41:06,557
But we didn't bring a drill with us.

2039
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:08,640
- So how are we going get through it?
- We'll manage.

2040
01:41:09,223 --> 01:41:11,348
We'll have to become one
to cross that wall.

2041
01:41:11,807 --> 01:41:12,807
- Huh?
- Yes.

2042
01:41:14,265 --> 01:41:15,807
Here? In front of everyone?

2043
01:41:16,890 --> 01:41:17,723
Yes.

2044
01:41:18,223 --> 01:41:19,265
Let's go.

2045
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,140
Okay, okay, okay.

2046
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:25,473
What does she mean by "become one"?

2047
01:41:25,557 --> 01:41:26,473
Well...

2048
01:41:26,598 --> 01:41:27,557
I got it. I got it.

2049
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:28,765
Can you guys...

2050
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:30,265
Come here, Vicky.

2051
01:41:31,515 --> 01:41:33,057
Yes, I'm ready.

2052
01:41:36,807 --> 01:41:38,057
Hey, you can't watch.

2053
01:41:39,515 --> 01:41:40,348
I'm ready.

2054
01:41:40,473 --> 01:41:41,598
Get closer.

2055
01:41:45,557 --> 01:41:46,557
Even closer.

2056
01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:47,890
Even closer?

2057
01:41:50,682 --> 01:41:51,807
Closer.

2058
01:42:18,432 --> 01:42:21,223
She possessed him!
She has taken over my brother's body!

2059
01:42:22,598 --> 01:42:24,557
Mystical powers! Mystical powers!

2060
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,390
She has taken over Vicky's body!

2061
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,390
She is taking my brother away,
Brother Rudra!

2062
01:42:28,473 --> 01:42:30,223
She is taking my brother through
the wall, Brother Rudra!

2063
01:42:30,307 --> 01:42:32,640
- Mystical powers!
- Vicky!

2064
01:42:37,015 --> 01:42:38,140
Brother Rudra?

2065
01:42:41,307 --> 01:42:42,765
Where did he go, Brother Rudra?

2066
01:42:42,848 --> 01:42:45,390
She has mystical powers.
Did you break your nose?

2067
01:42:48,723 --> 01:42:50,057
Hello?

2068
01:42:51,473 --> 01:42:53,140
Are you really inside me?

2069
01:42:56,223 --> 01:42:57,640
This is the first time

2070
01:42:57,807 --> 01:43:00,098
I've had such close contact with someone.

2071
01:43:26,223 --> 01:43:27,143
What were you doing?

2072
01:43:27,223 --> 01:43:28,307
I was just...

2073
01:43:30,182 --> 01:43:31,390
Nothing.

2074
01:43:32,307 --> 01:43:33,390
Sorry.

2075
01:43:35,182 --> 01:43:36,890
But how did you even
pull off this miracle?

2076
01:43:37,223 --> 01:43:38,307
You entered my body,

2077
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:40,143
then we crossed the wall,
and now you stepped out.

2078
01:43:40,223 --> 01:43:41,307
Shh, Vicky.

2079
01:43:47,515 --> 01:43:49,640
Don't worry, I'm here with you.

2080
01:43:52,348 --> 01:43:54,140
It's so dark in here.

2081
01:43:56,557 --> 01:43:58,140
Let's wait right here. He'll come.

2082
01:43:58,682 --> 01:43:59,682
Let's go.

2083
01:44:12,390 --> 01:44:15,390
Oh, damn! What is this place?

2084
01:44:17,223 --> 01:44:19,640
I'm sure no one in the Chanderi Tourist Department
knows about this place.

2085
01:44:20,015 --> 01:44:21,807
It could really boost tourism
in Chanderi--

2086
01:44:31,765 --> 01:44:32,973
Did you see that?

2087
01:44:34,098 --> 01:44:37,015
It's... molten lava.

2088
01:44:53,182 --> 01:44:54,182
Over there.

2089
01:44:55,598 --> 01:44:57,557
Aren't those the missing girls
from Chanderi?

2090
01:44:58,515 --> 01:44:59,765
Go...

2091
01:45:00,890 --> 01:45:02,223
and save those women.

2092
01:45:03,432 --> 01:45:04,432
Okay.

2093
01:45:04,973 --> 01:45:06,557
Come on, let's go save them.

2094
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:07,890
Not me.

2095
01:45:09,098 --> 01:45:10,015
Just you.

2096
01:45:13,182 --> 01:45:14,557
And why not you?

2097
01:45:15,598 --> 01:45:17,807
Vicky, the headless monster
doesn't want to sacrifice those girls.

2098
01:45:18,682 --> 01:45:19,723
He wants to sacrifice me.

2099
01:45:19,807 --> 01:45:20,807
What?

2100
01:45:21,223 --> 01:45:22,390
He wants to sacrifice you?

2101
01:45:23,182 --> 01:45:24,432
No,

2102
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:27,598
that headless monster wants
Ms. Stree's sacrifice, not yours.

2103
01:45:27,682 --> 01:45:29,390
For him, I'm Stree,

2104
01:45:29,807 --> 01:45:31,890
because I have her braid.

2105
01:45:34,765 --> 01:45:37,432
Then let's chop that braid off
and give it to him.

2106
01:45:38,182 --> 01:45:41,890
Let's deal with this headless
monster first, otherwise.

2107
01:45:42,265 --> 01:45:44,015
Like hell, he wants to sacrifice you!
Hey, headless monster!

2108
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:46,890
No one can do anything.
He's very powerful.

2109
01:45:47,348 --> 01:45:49,265
This is the only way to stop him.

2110
01:45:49,557 --> 01:45:50,890
This is why I came here.

2111
01:45:51,807 --> 01:45:54,723
And your purpose
is much greater than this.

2112
01:45:54,848 --> 01:45:56,973
You still don't know the powers you have.

2113
01:45:57,098 --> 01:45:58,557
I don't want any powers.

2114
01:45:58,682 --> 01:46:00,015
I WANT YOU!

2115
01:46:01,015 --> 01:46:03,348
I'm not going to leave you.
I won't let you sacrifice yourself.

2116
01:46:03,432 --> 01:46:04,390
I'm not going anywhere.

2117
01:46:04,473 --> 01:46:05,473
Vicky,

2118
01:46:06,182 --> 01:46:07,598
you're a protector.

2119
01:46:07,723 --> 01:46:10,102
Don't be so selfish when it comes to love.

2120
01:46:10,182 --> 01:46:12,390
- Go. We don't have much time.
- Yes, I am selfish.

2121
01:46:12,473 --> 01:46:13,598
I'm selfish.

2122
01:46:14,182 --> 01:46:15,723
I'm not going to let you go.

2123
01:46:15,973 --> 01:46:17,723
I... I'm going to sit right here.

2124
01:46:18,182 --> 01:46:20,057
Let him come, I'll handle him.

2125
01:46:21,390 --> 01:46:22,890
I won't let you sacrifice yourself.

2126
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,807
I'm not leaving.

2127
01:46:28,973 --> 01:46:30,390
I'm not going anywhere.

2128
01:46:30,765 --> 01:46:31,890
I'm not leaving.

2129
01:46:33,598 --> 01:46:34,890
Vicky, please?

2130
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:36,973
For my sake?

2131
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:40,598
This is cheating.

2132
01:46:42,765 --> 01:46:44,102
She is going to sacrifice herself.

2133
01:46:44,182 --> 01:46:46,060
- Who?!
- The one who says Vicky please.

2134
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:47,182
She left my brother.

2135
01:46:58,098 --> 01:46:58,765
VICKY!

2136
01:46:58,848 --> 01:47:00,765
No, I'm alright. I'm alright!

2137
01:47:01,348 --> 01:47:03,390
I'm alright!

2138
01:47:03,557 --> 01:47:04,682
Be careful.

2139
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:07,765
My vision's all blurry from the tears.

2140
01:47:22,682 --> 01:47:24,390
I'm okay...

2141
01:47:29,765 --> 01:47:31,265
Daddy...

2142
01:47:31,557 --> 01:47:32,848
Daddy...

2143
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:35,557
WATCH OUT, VICKY!

2144
01:47:35,807 --> 01:47:37,598
- What happened?!
- He made it. He's safe.

2145
01:47:37,682 --> 01:47:38,390
What happened?

2146
01:47:38,473 --> 01:47:40,348
He was about to fall into the lava,
but he got through it.

2147
01:47:51,189 --> 01:47:52,307
Let's go.

2148
01:47:53,598 --> 01:47:54,765
Let's go, hurry up.

2149
01:48:08,098 --> 01:48:09,140
Ms. Shama?

2150
01:48:10,098 --> 01:48:11,182
Hey, Ms. Shama?

2151
01:48:11,557 --> 01:48:13,432
Ms. Shama, it's me, Vicky.

2152
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:15,890
Remember,
I danced with you the other day?

2153
01:48:16,807 --> 01:48:20,890
"Behold this beauty
with your eyes tonight, my dove."

2154
01:48:21,723 --> 01:48:22,932
Is Shama alright?

2155
01:48:23,015 --> 01:48:25,015
Yeah, she's fine.
She's just a little bald, that's it.

2156
01:48:25,098 --> 01:48:25,932
She's not hurt, is she?

2157
01:48:26,015 --> 01:48:27,807
Brother Rudra,
you don't want me to see anything else?

2158
01:48:28,182 --> 01:48:29,015
Do you really just want me
to keep looking at Shama?

2159
01:48:29,098 --> 01:48:31,140
- No, no, look at everything happening out there.
- Okay.

2160
01:48:46,765 --> 01:48:48,223
Chitti!

2161
01:48:48,723 --> 01:48:49,932
Chitti, it's me, Vicky.

2162
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:51,140
Come on, let's go.

2163
01:48:56,848 --> 01:48:59,973
Soft Chitti, warm Chitti,
little ball of fur.

2164
01:49:00,098 --> 01:49:01,682
Happy Chitti, something Chitti,

2165
01:49:01,765 --> 01:49:03,140
Burr, burr, burr...

2166
01:49:11,890 --> 01:49:13,098
Statue over!

2167
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:30,932
Hey! What's going on?

2168
01:49:31,515 --> 01:49:32,973
Hey, these girls--

2169
01:49:50,932 --> 01:49:53,890
You freaky head!

2170
01:50:30,098 --> 01:50:31,682
We did it! We won!

2171
01:50:32,098 --> 01:50:34,848
Just wait and watch,
he is going to destroy them.

2172
01:50:34,973 --> 01:50:35,723
- Shut it.
- Shut up.

2173
01:50:35,807 --> 01:50:37,015
You enemy.

2174
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:40,432
You okay?

2175
01:50:40,557 --> 01:50:41,682
- Okay?
- Yes.

2176
01:50:41,932 --> 01:50:42,765
Okay?

2177
01:50:43,098 --> 01:50:46,098
You want me to give you mouth-to-mouth?

2178
01:50:46,348 --> 01:50:47,848
Why did you come here?

2179
01:50:48,973 --> 01:50:50,682
No point sacrificing yourself.

2180
01:50:51,265 --> 01:50:53,307
Your Bluetooth's hooked up to those girls.

2181
01:50:53,848 --> 01:50:56,348
They would have died too
if you'd done that.

2182
01:50:57,265 --> 01:51:01,140
That's why I chopped
that head off in one go.

2183
01:51:02,015 --> 01:51:03,307
You should've seen it!

2184
01:51:03,973 --> 01:51:05,140
You missed it.

2185
01:51:07,307 --> 01:51:08,515
What?

2186
01:51:09,557 --> 01:51:10,723
Huh?!

2187
01:51:37,516 --> 01:51:40,848
I may be wearing a skirt,
but I'm no girl, you creepy head!

2188
01:51:48,848 --> 01:51:51,890
Glory to the Goddess!

2189
01:51:58,098 --> 01:52:00,182
YES!!!

2190
01:52:15,098 --> 01:52:16,723
Oh no, Brother Rudra!

2191
01:52:17,057 --> 01:52:19,515
The heads just keep multiplying
when you chop them off.

2192
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:25,973
Keep that braid swirling.

2193
01:52:26,098 --> 01:52:27,182
Keep it swirling.

2194
01:52:27,682 --> 01:52:29,932
Looks like the braid
and dagger don't work on them.

2195
01:52:30,015 --> 01:52:32,390
Huh? So what do we do now?

2196
01:52:34,557 --> 01:52:35,723
Look over there.

2197
01:52:36,015 --> 01:52:37,102
A sword?

2198
01:52:37,182 --> 01:52:38,640
Who left a sword here?

2199
01:52:38,723 --> 01:52:39,473
Hey!

2200
01:52:39,557 --> 01:52:41,682
Looks like it's the one Stree used
to behead him.

2201
01:52:42,265 --> 01:52:44,223
Then maybe that's what will kill him.

2202
01:52:44,307 --> 01:52:45,307
- Yeah?
- Yes.

2203
01:52:45,390 --> 01:52:47,057
Go get it.

2204
01:52:47,307 --> 01:52:48,765
Okay, okay, okay.

2205
01:52:59,182 --> 01:53:00,473
Hey freaky head!

2206
01:53:03,307 --> 01:53:05,182
If you want to live,

2207
01:53:05,265 --> 01:53:06,515
let the girl go.

2208
01:53:06,598 --> 01:53:09,265
Vicky, they're already dead!

2209
01:53:09,598 --> 01:53:12,223
Yeah, I mean let the girl go!

2210
01:53:12,723 --> 01:53:14,515
If you think you're man enough,

2211
01:53:14,932 --> 01:53:16,348
come fight me.

2212
01:53:28,223 --> 01:53:29,223
Huh?

2213
01:53:30,515 --> 01:53:31,640
Damn it!

2214
01:53:34,015 --> 01:53:35,890
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on out or else!

2215
01:53:35,973 --> 01:53:37,557
Shame on you, man!

2216
01:53:37,807 --> 01:53:39,307
Time out! Time out! I'm taking it out.

2217
01:53:39,390 --> 01:53:41,057
Give me a minute, give me a minute.

2218
01:53:41,140 --> 01:53:42,390
From deep down, Vicky.

2219
01:53:42,473 --> 01:53:43,057
What?

2220
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:45,432
Put your whole heart
into trying to pull it out!

2221
01:53:46,348 --> 01:53:52,015
"From the bottom of your heart,
I want you to come on out."

2222
01:53:52,098 --> 01:53:54,182
Don't sing the song! Put your heart into
it and try to get it out!

2223
01:53:54,265 --> 01:53:55,765
I tried! I just can't get it out!

2224
01:53:58,807 --> 01:53:59,973
Wait a second.

2225
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:06,557
Daddy! Daddy!

2226
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:10,182
I was just joking when I challenged you!
I was just kidding!

2227
01:54:19,432 --> 01:54:20,848
VICKY!

2228
01:54:36,348 --> 01:54:38,807
We have to do something or he'll kill them!
Please, Brother Rudra!

2229
01:55:48,515 --> 01:55:50,807
I told you I have a Plan B!

2230
01:56:00,932 --> 01:56:02,515
Very good, Bhasky! Very good!

2231
01:56:30,807 --> 01:56:31,640
Are you okay?

2232
01:56:31,723 --> 01:56:33,057
- Yeah?
- Yes.

2233
01:56:33,765 --> 01:56:35,140
Did... did you see that?

2234
01:56:35,515 --> 01:56:37,223
Where the heck did
that shape-shifting dog come from?

2235
01:56:37,307 --> 01:56:38,807
He's not a shape-shifting dog,

2236
01:56:38,890 --> 01:56:39,890
he's a wolf.

2237
01:56:40,390 --> 01:56:41,432
A wolf?!

2238
01:59:14,932 --> 01:59:18,973
MOTHER!!!!

2239
02:00:31,473 --> 02:00:33,848
- What's happening?!
- It's the epic battle, Brother Rudra!

2240
02:00:33,932 --> 02:00:35,557
THE EPIC BATTLE!

2241
02:00:47,094 --> 02:00:49,057
We're going to win!
We will win!

2242
02:01:00,390 --> 02:01:02,015
Yes!

2243
02:01:09,515 --> 02:01:10,723
No, don't.

2244
02:01:13,140 --> 02:01:15,098
If the Stree chapter ends,
so does the world.

2245
02:01:15,515 --> 02:01:18,182
No.
It's not over till it's over, Vicky.

2246
02:01:18,473 --> 02:01:20,432
You're the only one
who can pull that sword out.

2247
02:01:20,515 --> 02:01:22,098
- Just you.
- No.

2248
02:01:22,182 --> 02:01:23,182
No, I can't do it.

2249
02:01:23,265 --> 02:01:24,723
You have to recognize your powers.

2250
02:01:24,807 --> 02:01:27,515
Recognize the honesty
and simplicity in your heart.

2251
02:01:27,640 --> 02:01:28,890
That's your power.

2252
02:01:28,973 --> 02:01:30,223
Put your heart into trying
to pull it out, Vicky!

2253
02:01:30,307 --> 02:01:31,723
Go, give it a shot.

2254
02:01:32,098 --> 02:01:33,307
GO!

2255
02:01:52,765 --> 02:01:54,098
Hey!

2256
02:02:58,890 --> 02:03:00,473
Ms. Stree!!!

2257
02:05:03,648 --> 02:05:05,060
We won!

2258
02:05:05,140 --> 02:05:07,015
We did it! She took him down!
She slayed him!

2259
02:05:31,015 --> 02:05:33,640
It's me, Vicky.

2260
02:06:10,515 --> 02:06:12,015
Go, Mother.

2261
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:45,807
Bittu!

2262
02:06:45,932 --> 02:06:48,432
Oh, Bittu is fine!
You are back to your usual self, Bittu!

2263
02:06:48,515 --> 02:06:50,223
Thanks to you, Bittu is back!

2264
02:06:50,307 --> 02:06:52,223
You know, I jumped

2265
02:06:52,307 --> 02:06:53,598
- and chopped his head off in one go.
- Yes, we saw that.

2266
02:06:53,682 --> 02:06:55,848
- And then, Ms. Stree grabbed him by his head
- Yes.

2267
02:06:55,932 --> 02:06:57,890
and tossed him into the lava,
just like that.

2268
02:06:58,932 --> 02:07:01,307
We were all there watching it happen.

2269
02:07:01,473 --> 02:07:03,473
Tell me something,
when will Shama be back from there?

2270
02:07:03,557 --> 02:07:05,432
And what about Chitti? Where's Chitti?

2271
02:07:05,515 --> 02:07:06,890
Aw, my dear lover boys...

2272
02:07:06,973 --> 02:07:09,557
Look, there they come -
Shama, Chitti, and all the other women.

2273
02:07:31,182 --> 02:07:33,890
"Through your deeds,
righteousness is shown,"

2274
02:07:33,973 --> 02:07:36,848
"With discipline, courage is known,"

2275
02:07:36,932 --> 02:07:40,473
"In success or failure, stay the same,
with a balanced heart and steady aim."

2276
02:08:06,057 --> 02:08:07,223
Yes,

2277
02:08:07,807 --> 02:08:09,307
I'm Stree's daughter.

2278
02:08:10,348 --> 02:08:12,182
But she wanted to kill you.

2279
02:08:12,348 --> 02:08:14,432
She doesn't recognize me
in this form.

2280
02:08:15,973 --> 02:08:18,390
In her eyes,
her daughter is still the little girl

2281
02:08:19,182 --> 02:08:21,348
who was crying as she was killed.

2282
02:08:23,182 --> 02:08:24,307
When she was killed?

2283
02:08:25,348 --> 02:08:27,182
But that was like forever ago.

2284
02:08:27,265 --> 02:08:28,640
It's part of our scriptures.

2285
02:08:28,973 --> 02:08:29,973
Vicky...

2286
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:33,265
Vicky, all I ever wanted was to help

2287
02:08:33,890 --> 02:08:35,640
my mother's soul find salvation.

2288
02:08:35,723 --> 02:08:37,432
And you were the only one
who could make that happen.

2289
02:08:37,765 --> 02:08:40,973
That's why I reached out to you
and befriended you.

2290
02:08:43,390 --> 02:08:46,348
From helping Stree find salvation
to slaying that headless monster -

2291
02:08:46,890 --> 02:08:48,473
it all happened because of you.

2292
02:08:49,182 --> 02:08:50,307
Because of me?

2293
02:08:52,432 --> 02:08:53,890
I don't get it.

2294
02:08:54,973 --> 02:08:56,140
You...

2295
02:08:57,348 --> 02:08:59,557
Why didn't you tell me
about all this earlier?

2296
02:09:01,348 --> 02:09:02,973
How could I have, Vicky?

2297
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:05,182
How could I tell you that I...?

2298
02:09:05,973 --> 02:09:06,973
That you...?

2299
02:09:08,515 --> 02:09:10,932
That I am what everyone thinks I am.

2300
02:09:11,223 --> 02:09:12,348
What do you mean?

2301
02:09:13,390 --> 02:09:14,432
An illusion,

2302
02:09:15,348 --> 02:09:16,432
a shadow.

2303
02:09:18,182 --> 02:09:19,265
You...

2304
02:09:20,015 --> 02:09:21,348
You are a ghost?

2305
02:09:22,932 --> 02:09:25,807
But aren't you way too pretty
to be a ghost?

2306
02:09:26,973 --> 02:09:29,390
And your feet too...

2307
02:09:32,932 --> 02:09:36,348
So everything we had was all just a lie?

2308
02:09:39,348 --> 02:09:40,890
No, it wasn't a lie.

2309
02:09:42,057 --> 02:09:44,348
It's a relationship,
that will always remain.

2310
02:09:46,015 --> 02:09:48,265
It's a bond
that one soul shares with another.

2311
02:09:50,057 --> 02:09:51,182
Soul...

2312
02:09:55,348 --> 02:09:56,682
Please, don't leave.

2313
02:09:57,182 --> 02:09:59,098
I'll adjust to the fact
that you're a ghost.

2314
02:09:59,182 --> 02:10:00,557
Dad will understand too.

2315
02:10:00,765 --> 02:10:01,682
He...

2316
02:10:02,390 --> 02:10:04,348
Please, don't go.

2317
02:10:05,890 --> 02:10:07,223
I have to go.

2318
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:10,682
I don't even know your name.

2319
02:10:17,182 --> 02:10:18,223
Huh?

2320
02:10:19,807 --> 02:10:20,973
Seriously?

2321
02:10:21,890 --> 02:10:23,223
Yes.

2322
02:10:23,515 --> 02:10:24,765
Oh, it's nice.

2323
02:10:25,098 --> 02:10:26,598
We'll cross paths again, Vicky.

2324
02:10:27,765 --> 02:10:29,098
Remember,

2325
02:10:29,682 --> 02:10:31,307
we are already one.

2326
02:10:33,682 --> 02:10:37,723
I am wherever you are.

2327
02:10:45,390 --> 02:10:46,807
Take care.

2328
02:10:47,807 --> 02:10:51,265
And make sure to eat on time...
whatever it is you guys eat.

2329
02:11:03,390 --> 02:11:04,557
Huh?

2330
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:06,223
Oh shit!

2331
02:11:07,307 --> 02:11:08,557
She's gone!

2332
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,890
Hey...

2333
02:11:38,515 --> 02:11:39,515
Vicky...

2334
02:11:39,598 --> 02:11:40,807
Sorry, we're late.

2335
02:11:40,890 --> 02:11:42,102
Sorry, Brother. Really sorry.

2336
02:11:42,182 --> 02:11:43,098
Where is she?

2337
02:11:43,182 --> 02:11:45,848
- She's gone.
- Huh?

2338
02:11:45,932 --> 02:11:48,223
Oh no, I didn't even get to say goodbye.

2339
02:11:48,307 --> 02:11:49,473
Gone again?

2340
02:11:49,890 --> 02:11:51,515
Did you at least ask
for her name this time?

2341
02:11:52,057 --> 02:11:53,223
Yes.

2342
02:11:53,307 --> 02:11:54,807
So what did she say it was?

2343
02:11:58,307 --> 02:12:00,765
- What?
- He's trying to remember.

2344
02:12:01,432 --> 02:12:03,307
Tell us, Vicky. Come on, spill it.

2345
02:12:06,682 --> 02:12:07,932
What happened, Vicky?

2346
02:12:08,307 --> 02:12:10,098
He knows but he's not telling us.

2347
02:12:24,265 --> 02:12:25,848
Bhasky!

2348
02:12:27,432 --> 02:12:28,598
Janardhan!

2349
02:12:28,682 --> 02:12:29,307
Where are you?

2350
02:12:29,390 --> 02:12:30,223
JD!

2351
02:12:30,307 --> 02:12:31,390
JD!

2352
02:12:32,098 --> 02:12:33,682
- Where were you?
- Where were you hiding?

2353
02:12:33,765 --> 02:12:35,015
Here, try these on.

2354
02:12:35,182 --> 02:12:36,307
Ugh, gross.

2355
02:12:38,182 --> 02:12:39,682
Whose raggedy clothes did you steal?

2356
02:12:39,765 --> 02:12:40,682
These are mine.

2357
02:12:40,765 --> 02:12:41,890
You'll look good in them.

2358
02:12:41,973 --> 02:12:44,307
You wear Munni's underwear?!
You pervert!

2359
02:12:46,682 --> 02:12:47,890
And what the heck was that, man?

2360
02:12:48,015 --> 02:12:49,473
How did that creature
even end up in Chanderi?

2361
02:12:49,598 --> 02:12:51,015
It's a long story,

2362
02:12:51,098 --> 02:12:52,723
I'll tell you later.
Let's go home now.

2363
02:12:52,807 --> 02:12:54,265
I'll pack and then
we'll hit the road to Delhi.

2364
02:12:54,348 --> 02:12:56,265
- Brother, you rock my clothes.
- You can't go to Delhi.

2365
02:12:56,348 --> 02:12:57,390
Why not?

2366
02:12:58,515 --> 02:12:59,765
It's dangerous out there.

2367
02:12:59,848 --> 02:13:00,807
Why, because of the pollution?

2368
02:13:00,890 --> 02:13:02,598
Something much worse.

2369
02:13:03,182 --> 02:13:08,682
He sinks his fangs into this vein
and sucks the blood out.

2370
02:13:09,140 --> 02:13:10,765
Look JD, I'm a wolf,

2371
02:13:10,848 --> 02:13:12,348
I can handle myself in any situation.

2372
02:13:12,432 --> 02:13:14,060
But if he gets you...

2373
02:13:14,140 --> 02:13:16,265
He'll slurp up my blood like a soda.

2374
02:13:16,348 --> 02:13:17,223
Hundred percent.

2375
02:13:17,307 --> 02:13:18,682
You are right.

2376
02:13:18,765 --> 02:13:21,140
You should go to Delhi
and give me a buzz if you need anything.

2377
02:13:21,223 --> 02:13:22,432
I need you.
I really need you for something.

2378
02:13:22,515 --> 02:13:24,223
I'm always there for you, bro. Always.

2379
02:13:24,557 --> 02:13:28,765
You know that chick with the big eyes
and the long braid?

2380
02:13:29,057 --> 02:13:31,140
Set me up with her.

2381
02:13:31,223 --> 02:13:33,723
Hey, my friend already has
a thing with her.

2382
02:13:33,932 --> 02:13:35,348
The one in the frock?

2383
02:13:35,432 --> 02:13:37,223
I bet she would ditch him for me.

2384
02:13:37,307 --> 02:13:39,473
Bhasky, you're a wolf,

2385
02:13:39,682 --> 02:13:40,932
but don't act like a creepy animal.

2386
02:13:41,057 --> 02:13:42,515
Okay, what about just an intro?

2387
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:44,682
She is powerful, and so am I.

2388
02:13:44,890 --> 02:13:47,473
Together, we'd be a power couple.

2389
02:13:47,598 --> 02:13:49,598
Blegh! Let me go, you rascal.
You've changed, Bhasky.

2390
02:13:49,682 --> 02:13:51,390
At least tell me where she lives,
what she's into,

2391
02:13:51,473 --> 02:13:53,015
- what she eats, and what she's looking for.
- Disgusting.

2392
02:13:53,098 --> 02:13:53,973
Let me at least make a move.

2393
02:13:54,057 --> 02:13:55,598
Your buddy won't be able to handle her.

2394
02:13:55,682 --> 02:13:56,432
Come on man, you're a wolf!

2395
02:13:56,515 --> 02:13:57,640
- Stop behaving like a dirty rabbit!
- Trust me, he won't be able to handle her.

2396
02:13:57,723 --> 02:14:00,432
- I want her! I really want her!
- She is not going to come back.

2397
02:14:00,765 --> 02:14:01,932
She was unfaithful.

2398
02:14:02,015 --> 02:14:03,973
She was an illusion.

2399
02:14:04,390 --> 02:14:08,723
"You made a promise but it was a lie,"

2400
02:14:12,015 --> 02:14:16,057
"You made a promise but it was a lie,"

2401
02:14:16,140 --> 02:14:20,015
"You made a promise but it was a lie,"

2402
02:14:20,098 --> 02:14:23,890
"I waited all night in the fields
but you never came by."

2403
02:14:24,015 --> 02:14:27,557
"I waited all night in the fields
but you never came by."

2404
02:14:27,640 --> 02:14:31,682
"I waited all night in the fields
but you never came by."

2405
02:14:39,307 --> 02:14:43,348
"With no blanket to warm me
in the middle of the night,"

2406
02:14:43,432 --> 02:14:47,265
"With no blanket to warm me
in the middle of the night,"

2407
02:14:47,348 --> 02:14:50,973
"You said you'd be there
but you never came by."

2408
02:14:51,057 --> 02:14:54,848
"You said you'd be there
but you never came by."

2409
02:14:54,973 --> 02:14:58,973
"I waited all night in the fields
but you never came by."

2410
02:15:07,598 --> 02:15:11,432
"All dressed up
I was ready to leave that day,"

2411
02:15:11,515 --> 02:15:15,182
"But my mother glared and made me stay."

2412
02:15:19,265 --> 02:15:23,143
"She questioned,
"Where are you going, you little brat?"

2413
02:15:23,223 --> 02:15:26,307
"Maidens don't roam fields
and that's a fact!"

2414
02:15:26,390 --> 02:15:30,765
"She said boys who ask girls to meet
in the fields,"

2415
02:15:34,098 --> 02:15:38,057
"She said boys who ask girls to meet
in the fields,"

2416
02:15:38,140 --> 02:15:41,973
"They never marry those girls
and their love never seals."

2417
02:15:49,807 --> 02:15:53,432
"I spent the night in the fields waiting,
but you never came by,"

2418
02:15:53,557 --> 02:15:57,390
"I spent the night in the fields waiting,
but you never came by,"

2419
02:15:57,515 --> 02:16:02,015
"My youth is fading fast while
waiting here for you,"

2420
02:16:03,015 --> 02:16:05,932
No, my dear, in love.
Yes.

2421
02:16:09,140 --> 02:16:13,057
"My youth is fading fast while
waiting here for you,"

2422
02:16:13,140 --> 02:16:16,932
"I never wooed another girl
for I thought I had you."

2423
02:16:17,140 --> 02:16:20,807
"I never wooed another girl
for I thought I had you."

2424
02:16:20,890 --> 02:16:24,682
"I never wooed another girl
for I thought I had you."

2425
02:16:25,140 --> 02:16:28,223
You've said it three times already,
now move on.

2426
02:16:28,307 --> 02:16:32,057
"I spent the night in the fields waiting
but you never came by."

2427
02:16:32,140 --> 02:16:35,890
"I spent the night in the fields waiting
but you never came by."

2428
02:16:35,973 --> 02:16:39,807
"You said you'd be there
but you never came by."

2429
02:16:39,890 --> 02:16:43,765
"I spent the night in the fields waiting
but you never came by."
