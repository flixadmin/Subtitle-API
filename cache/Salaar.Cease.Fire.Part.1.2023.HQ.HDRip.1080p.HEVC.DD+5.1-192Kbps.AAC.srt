
1
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
In a far-off place,

2
00:00:39,575 --> 00:00:41,616
amidst vengeance and enmity...

3
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,908
flourished an inseparable friendship.

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,825
Who is it?
Who?

5
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:50,700
Hey, Deva!
Forget it.

6
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:53,116
- Listen to me.
- Tell Me.

7
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,741
Who is it?

8
00:00:58,116 --> 00:00:59,116
Deva!

9
00:01:04,283 --> 00:01:06,491
- Why did you touch him?
- Deva, don't!

10
00:01:07,283 --> 00:01:08,283
Oh...

11
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:10,950
I thought you were bringing a huge army.

12
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,116
But you got only him?

13
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:18,533
Just because you are born to my father

14
00:01:18,616 --> 00:01:20,456
you won't get the right
to wear that nose ring.

15
00:01:20,575 --> 00:01:21,950
You have to earn it.

16
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,366
Just tell me how.

17
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:38,575
Do you see that wrestler?

18
00:01:38,825 --> 00:01:40,450
He is my champion.

19
00:01:40,825 --> 00:01:43,200
He has not yet known what defeat is.

20
00:01:43,283 --> 00:01:44,658
Any challenger here?

21
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:47,241
There is no man here?

22
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,616
Make him fall to the ground.

23
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,980
I will give back your nose ring.

24
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:52,633
How is that even possible?
How can he make him fall to the ground?

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,575
Answer me, anybody here?

26
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:57,075
Absolutely no pressure.

27
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,283
The nose ring will remain
with me.

28
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,366
If you don't have the courage, back off...

29
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:03,491
...step-brother.

30
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,075
Rudra, you are making a mistake.

31
00:02:06,741 --> 00:02:08,825
You know me very well.

32
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:11,366
But, you don't know about him.

33
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:16,048
He will hit him so hard
that he would fly.

34
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:20,658
Before he finishes him off,
give back my nose ring.

35
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,950
If there is anyone, come forward.

36
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:27,241
He?

37
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:29,075
What will he do?

38
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:31,366
Tell me!

39
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:33,366
Come on!

40
00:02:34,075 --> 00:02:35,950
Is there no man here?

41
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,200
What is he even capable of?

42
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,575
At least, there is one man here.

43
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,033
Get lost!

44
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,700
Hey, Deva!

45
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:01,075
I told you to get lost!

46
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:11,616
Deva!

47
00:03:16,408 --> 00:03:17,866
He is going to die.

48
00:03:25,908 --> 00:03:27,200
Deva!

49
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:53,825
Deva!

50
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:55,366
Don't!

51
00:04:12,366 --> 00:04:13,366
Deva?

52
00:04:14,408 --> 00:04:15,408
Deva, open your eyes!

53
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:17,408
Deva, open your eyes!
Deva!

54
00:04:18,283 --> 00:04:19,283
Deva!

55
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,491
Deva, open your eyes!

56
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:25,658
Did he fall to the ground?

57
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:57,075
Give it back!

58
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:02,408
Give it to me.

59
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:11,783
If you touch his nose ring again

60
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:17,616
It won't be an electric wire
in my hands.

61
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,325
It will be an electric pole.

62
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,700
Let's go!

63
00:05:43,783 --> 00:05:45,741
In a far-off place

64
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:49,241
those who lose the battle

65
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,491
used to lose everything.

66
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,700
I want her.

67
00:06:19,741 --> 00:06:20,991
I will go first.

68
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:22,515
- I will show you. I...
- I want her.

69
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:56,658
Hey!

70
00:06:57,408 --> 00:06:59,033
If you try to touch his mother...

71
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:00,658
I will kill you all.

72
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:02,200
Go away from here!

73
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:10,950
Sir, don't stand in our way.

74
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,116
This is your father's order.

75
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,283
Nobody can disobey him.

76
00:07:15,991 --> 00:07:17,283
It should be done.

77
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,741
If you leave now, I will give you

78
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,616
my territory in return.

79
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,533
Varadha, think again.

80
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:48,075
I will give you Bharghat.

81
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,283
Bharghat is mine!

82
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,283
Bharghat is mine!
Bharghat...

83
00:08:08,408 --> 00:08:09,950
Out of all our territories

84
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:11,908
this is the biggest.

85
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,380
That is exactly why
I gave it to him, Baba.

86
00:08:14,616 --> 00:08:16,741
Bharghat is mine!

87
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:21,075
No one outside of here
should know about this.

88
00:08:21,575 --> 00:08:22,908
Get lost now!

89
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:26,491
Hey, let's go.

90
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,200
Bharghat belongs to me!

91
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:43,366
Deva.

92
00:08:46,616 --> 00:08:47,866
I am here for you.

93
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,200
Don't worry.

94
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:53,491
You shouldn't stay here anymore.

95
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,450
You must leave immediately.

96
00:08:56,825 --> 00:08:58,950
In that far-off place

97
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:01,450
even those close friends

98
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,116
had to part ways.

99
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:06,366
Hey, make it quick.

100
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:10,408
Promise me

101
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,700
that you will never
come back to this place.

102
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:20,325
You should forget whatever happened here.

103
00:09:23,325 --> 00:09:24,325
Promise me.

104
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:33,950
Deva!

105
00:09:41,825 --> 00:09:43,741
I am ready to be the hunted

106
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:46,075
or the hunter for you.

107
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:51,241
Only for you.

108
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:54,200
Whenever you call me

109
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:57,283
I will come back to this place.

110
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,283
I don't know if you remember.

111
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:13,533
The story I told you when
you were a kid.

112
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:15,616
A sultan of the Persian empire

113
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:21,325
wouldn't deploy his formidable
army no matter how big the problem is.

114
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:23,783
Instead, he would go to only one man.

115
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:28,200
He, who fulfills whatever
the Sultan wished for

116
00:10:28,283 --> 00:10:31,741
and destroys the Sultan's opponents.

117
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:37,200
That man was called...

118
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,325
I know, Baba.

119
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:47,991
Salaar!

120
00:11:19,283 --> 00:11:20,408
He will come back.

121
00:11:22,408 --> 00:11:23,450
My Salaar!

122
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:26,533
The sun sewed a wing

123
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:29,200
And winked his eyes with love

124
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:35,283
Has the beautiful twilight cloud come?

125
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:41,283
Have the rain cloud
poured down jasmine flowers?

126
00:11:41,616 --> 00:11:44,116
You are the one
who was born in the sky

127
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:47,366
My lucky star, be my precious gold

128
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:53,241
on this earth.

129
00:11:53,325 --> 00:11:59,033
Be a song, my beloved,
who touched my heart

130
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:19,991
One will hold the bow

131
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,991
And the other will be the arrow.

132
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,325
One is a roar and the other
is the turbulent sea.

133
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,158
Together they make deluge.

134
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:32,200
One is bravery
and the other a trident.

135
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:35,200
The new day will be a day of battle.

136
00:12:35,283 --> 00:12:40,700
Now it will be a love that
where blessing merges with letters.

137
00:12:41,283 --> 00:12:44,783
May it flourish a hundred years.

138
00:13:51,283 --> 00:13:52,967
Please come with me.
I'll show you the stock.

139
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:53,991
Okay.

140
00:13:55,408 --> 00:13:57,075
- Hello!
- Bilal!

141
00:13:57,158 --> 00:13:58,616
My daughter is on her way to India.

142
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,658
Have you gone crazy?

143
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:03,283
- Why did you let her?
- Do you think I did?

144
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:05,075
She came there on her own.

145
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,241
If they come to know
anything about her...

146
00:14:07,408 --> 00:14:08,325
No need for any doubt.

147
00:14:08,408 --> 00:14:09,967
They have been searching
for the past seven years.

148
00:14:09,991 --> 00:14:11,366
They would've known by now.

149
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:12,866
Radha Rama...

150
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:16,158
She is not a harmless soul

151
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:17,658
sitting quietly in a corner.

152
00:14:17,783 --> 00:14:20,741
You have no idea
how powerful she is today.

153
00:14:22,616 --> 00:14:25,200
After all, even Radha Rama's maid,
Obulamma

154
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:27,908
can decide the fate
of elections in certain constituencies.

155
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,283
Mother!

156
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,741
Speak.

157
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:32,950
We have finally found.

158
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:34,533
Not him.
We found his daughter.

159
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:35,825
Hey!

160
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:45,491
Krishnakanth had created eight fake
passports for himself and his daughter.

161
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:48,426
And one of these passports has been used
to book a ticket from the US to India.

162
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,842
Tomorrow at 6 o'clock in the morning...

163
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:52,825
she will land at Lal Bahadur Shastry
International Airport, Babatpur.

164
00:14:54,408 --> 00:14:57,908
Apart from this, she has
two notorious henchmen.

165
00:14:58,075 --> 00:14:59,075
Vedha...

166
00:14:59,116 --> 00:15:00,996
Krishnakanth's daughter
is coming to India, sir.

167
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:03,700
Krishnakanth's daughter?

168
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,950
Hazare.

169
00:15:07,075 --> 00:15:08,158
Tell me, Obulamma.

170
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,450
Krishnakanth's daughter
has come here.

171
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:14,366
I want her at any cost!

172
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,241
- Jessy!
- Sir?

173
00:15:17,325 --> 00:15:19,200
I have a lot
of election works here.

174
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:21,116
Leave for Babatpur immediately.

175
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Okay, sir.

176
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,700
For what you did to them seven years ago,

177
00:15:25,783 --> 00:15:27,700
they will pay back
using your daughter.

178
00:15:27,866 --> 00:15:29,366
Please do something, Bilal.

179
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,533
But what can I do?

180
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,158
Only you know his whereabouts.

181
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,700
So?

182
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,116
You remember the promise, Bilal?

183
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,325
Brother, show us the goods.

184
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:50,616
Get out!
All of you, out!

185
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,866
Get out!
All of you, out!

186
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:22,658
The time has come to fulfill your promise.

187
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:24,700
I know you won't come,
no matter what I say.

188
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,408
I am sending someone to you.

189
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:29,450
Whatever you decide, do it.

190
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:52,366
Three cars have been arranged...

191
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:55,116
...at the airport parking.

192
00:16:57,991 --> 00:16:59,991
In the street next to the airport...

193
00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:02,408
There are two cars and a tempo traveler.

194
00:17:08,116 --> 00:17:09,116
Come on!

195
00:17:39,783 --> 00:17:40,866
What is going on?

196
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:46,658
- Hey...
- Hey...

197
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:47,741
- Come.
- Who are you?

198
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:56,033
Hey! No, no... No!

199
00:17:57,283 --> 00:17:58,283
Come on, quick!

200
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:01,283
Go, go!

201
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:19,533
Hey, go!
Chase them!

202
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:02,158
Hey, hey!

203
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:03,950
What the hell is happening?

204
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:05,533
Why are they attacking me?

205
00:19:05,783 --> 00:19:08,450
There must be some sort of a mistake.
D-Did you see them, they...

206
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:11,294
They just shot that guy in the middle
of the road in broad daylight...

207
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:12,491
Speak.

208
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:16,450
Listen to me carefully, Aadhya.

209
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:18,908
- Dad! Dad...
- The guy who is with you.

210
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,033
Do as he says.

211
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:22,075
I will get you out of there
very soon.

212
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,116
Don't call me under any circumstances.

213
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
No... Dad...

214
00:19:25,575 --> 00:19:26,616
Listen to me, Dad.

215
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,033
No, no... no...

216
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:29,616
We... we need to call the cops!

217
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:31,491
We need to call the cops, please.

218
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,820
- You don't have to...
- Hey!

219
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:35,700
You shouldn't have come to India.
But you did!

220
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:37,658
You have no idea
what is happening here.

221
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:39,325
No need to understand also

222
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:40,700
and we don't have time for that.

223
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:42,033
In this situation

224
00:19:42,158 --> 00:19:44,116
there's only one person in
all of India

225
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:47,116
who can protect you.

226
00:19:47,575 --> 00:19:48,616
Mother!

227
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:12,491
She doesn't easily trust
or accept any outsider.

228
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:14,866
You will have to convince her.

229
00:20:15,325 --> 00:20:16,616
For whatever reason,

230
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,866
she should never get to know who you are.

231
00:20:19,283 --> 00:20:20,366
Good evening, Teacher.

232
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,950
This is Diya from Vijayawada.
She knows our language.

233
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:25,366
A distant relative of our bank manager,
Mr Ajay Kumar.

234
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,467
She wants to teach English
to the kids in our school.

235
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:28,991
That post is vacant anyway.

236
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:31,115
Let's employ her.
She will stay in your guest house.

237
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,325
Uh... only if you agree.

238
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:35,408
What is your qualification?

239
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:36,616
Uh... English Literature.

240
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:38,950
Her AADHAAR Card...

241
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:39,866
Voter ID...

242
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,325
Class X, intermediate
and degree certificates...

243
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,741
I have verified them all, Teacher.
You can check them too.

244
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,491
Where did you work before this?

245
00:20:46,658 --> 00:20:47,825
Siddhartha Convent.

246
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:51,700
Who is going to teach the kids?
You?

247
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:52,783
Or she?

248
00:20:56,491 --> 00:20:57,825
Where did you work before?

249
00:20:58,116 --> 00:20:59,283
Siddhartha Convent.

250
00:20:59,366 --> 00:21:00,283
Why did you quit?

251
00:21:00,366 --> 00:21:01,200
Actually...

252
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:04,044
You are highly educated.
Why do you want to work in a place like this?

253
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:04,950
That's what I...

254
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:06,884
Mr Sarpanch,
I don't think she is up to the task.

255
00:21:06,908 --> 00:21:08,616
Send her away and
find someone else.

256
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:20,575
When we reach a new place,
we like it

257
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:22,033
not because of that place.

258
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:23,825
It's because of the people there.

259
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,950
I have roamed several places
and finally come here.

260
00:21:28,158 --> 00:21:30,950
Like how you are apprehensive
of trusting an outsider...

261
00:21:31,866 --> 00:21:33,908
I am very apprehensive as well.

262
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Let us both take a chance.

263
00:21:37,866 --> 00:21:39,116
If it doesn't work out...

264
00:21:40,658 --> 00:21:41,700
I will leave.

265
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,033
You can stay in the out house.

266
00:21:49,116 --> 00:21:52,325
Not I, the children here
must like your teaching.

267
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:54,033
You have three days.

268
00:21:54,241 --> 00:21:57,450
If the children don't like you,
you must leave on the fourth day.

269
00:21:58,616 --> 00:21:59,950
Hey, get up!

270
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:04,616
If you don't bring your parents tomorrow,
or don't turn up at school,

271
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,450
you will know who I am.

272
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,908
Leave!

273
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:10,991
Why did you lie?

274
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,658
Who lied?

275
00:22:12,741 --> 00:22:13,741
Hey, get going.

276
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:20,741
Children are like molten iron.

277
00:22:23,283 --> 00:22:24,950
If we mold them well,

278
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,658
they become lamps that spread light.

279
00:22:35,575 --> 00:22:37,575
If we don't,

280
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:45,783
they become blood-shedding...

281
00:22:54,158 --> 00:22:55,700
...weapons.

282
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:32,658
Get freshened up and come.

283
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:36,158
I will get you some food.

284
00:23:51,616 --> 00:23:52,866
I did as you instructed.

285
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,825
She has agreed.
Please let me go.

286
00:23:56,283 --> 00:23:57,491
Hey, Sarpanch!

287
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:09,825
- Jessy?
- Sir, that girl is missing.

288
00:24:18,325 --> 00:24:20,283
She hasn't been eating
since yesterday, Madam.

289
00:24:22,158 --> 00:24:23,366
He should be killed.

290
00:24:23,825 --> 00:24:24,825
He should be killed.

291
00:24:25,741 --> 00:24:27,533
For the past seven years

292
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:31,283
you have been sitting
like this in darkness,

293
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,200
on the bare floor,

294
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:37,366
in the burning smoke.

295
00:24:42,158 --> 00:24:48,325
I know for a fact that no hunger matches
the hunger for vengeance.

296
00:24:49,158 --> 00:24:51,866
Krishnakanth couldn't be traced.

297
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:55,825
Even though his daughter came here,

298
00:24:56,158 --> 00:24:59,116
our men failed to catch her.

299
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:04,783
But no matter where she is, I'll find her
and make her kneel in front of you.

300
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:09,325
Even to exact your revenge,

301
00:25:09,825 --> 00:25:12,700
you need to stay alive.

302
00:25:43,158 --> 00:25:45,741
Our time has come.

303
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,408
Our time has come.

304
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:10,325
More than finding her, their plan

305
00:26:10,408 --> 00:26:12,700
would be to make sure
she doesn't leave India.

306
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:14,533
File a case against the girl.

307
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:15,491
- It won't happen again.
- Case?

308
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,075
- Charge her with murder.
- Murder?

309
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,158
- Whose murder should I mention?
- Please, sir!

310
00:26:26,575 --> 00:26:27,616
Do your job.

311
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:32,866
They will file a case against her and
inform the Embassy and police stations.

312
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:34,450
You got to take a look at this.

313
00:26:34,783 --> 00:26:36,908
Aadhya Krishnakanth, 28 years old...

314
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:40,325
US National, murdered Jessy Bhagga.
Varanasi outskirts.

315
00:26:40,408 --> 00:26:41,491
- Hey...
- Brother?

316
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:44,533
Send our men in all directions.

317
00:26:44,616 --> 00:26:47,741
Bus stations, railway stations, ports,
airports, highways, borders...

318
00:26:47,991 --> 00:26:49,575
Their men will be everywhere.

319
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:53,033
- There should not be any mistake.
- Okay, boss.

320
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,950
They can come here any time.

321
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:56,325
They are searching for this car.

322
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:57,533
Dismantle it immediately.

323
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,950
Could you find where the vehicle
with that girl went?

324
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:07,521
Found it on a CCTV footage, sir.

325
00:27:09,491 --> 00:27:12,783
They left that van at a warehouse
and went out in a black SUV.

326
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,450
Obulamma has already
instructed Hazare to find that girl.

327
00:27:18,116 --> 00:27:19,476
Why are we also searching for her?

328
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:21,325
We are not looking for the girl.

329
00:27:21,866 --> 00:27:23,741
We are looking for Krishnakanth.

330
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:27,575
For the past seven years,
we have been searching for him.

331
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:32,491
We searched every nook
and corner of the country.

332
00:27:33,408 --> 00:27:36,616
We have access to every single
CCTV camera in the country.

333
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:39,908
But not a single CCTV could capture him.

334
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,325
We don't know where he is.

335
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,116
Then what is the relation
between the girl and him?

336
00:27:45,575 --> 00:27:46,700
There is a relation!

337
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,366
Wherever she is...

338
00:27:49,741 --> 00:27:51,200
he is bound to be there.

339
00:27:52,866 --> 00:27:54,700
Find that vehicle first.

340
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:10,991
Hello!

341
00:28:11,158 --> 00:28:12,991
Can anybody hear me?

342
00:28:13,116 --> 00:28:16,075
- Good morning, Teacher.
- Good morning, Teacher.

343
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:18,950
Ma'am.

344
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:22,366
Though we locked her in,
the English teacher came out.

345
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,866
Someone locked the door from outside.

346
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:26,092
- That's why I am late...
- Chandru.

347
00:28:26,116 --> 00:28:26,950
Yes, Ma'am.

348
00:28:27,033 --> 00:28:30,325
Take this teacher to her classroom
and explain the syllabus to her.

349
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:32,325
- Let's go.
- Good morning, Teacher.

350
00:28:32,741 --> 00:28:35,450
Hitler has left.

351
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:40,825
Take the syllabus.

352
00:28:40,908 --> 00:28:43,200
Take children.
Take class.

353
00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:44,491
And take care.

354
00:28:44,575 --> 00:28:46,283
Okay, you all just look here.

355
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,325
Come on.

356
00:28:57,991 --> 00:28:59,075
Hey, come here.

357
00:29:13,783 --> 00:29:16,241
When the children have no interest,
why are you forcing them?

358
00:29:16,325 --> 00:29:19,075
I won't send him to school from tomorrow.
Do whatever you want.

359
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,658
I will burn you all to ashes.

360
00:29:23,575 --> 00:29:26,950
What you did is a mistake.
Do you want them to become like you?

361
00:29:27,658 --> 00:29:30,075
Hey! All of you are
attending school from tomorrow.

362
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,450
Understand?

363
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:36,450
She sounds crazy, doesn't she?

364
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,420
Even I used to think
about her the same way.

365
00:29:38,741 --> 00:29:40,950
Most of those who live here
work in that coal mine.

366
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:44,158
Even small children work there
for daily wages.

367
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,884
Four years ago, Teacher
came to this place.

368
00:29:45,908 --> 00:29:49,616
She literally begged everyone
and got this school reopened.

369
00:29:49,783 --> 00:29:52,616
Since then, she has been educating
the children in this school.

370
00:29:55,741 --> 00:29:57,866
Now let's meet another person.

371
00:30:05,533 --> 00:30:08,616
Though Teacher is like this,
her son is entirely different.

372
00:30:11,616 --> 00:30:13,700
Hey, you! Are you blind?
Can't you see?

373
00:30:13,908 --> 00:30:15,533
But it was your mistake.

374
00:30:15,783 --> 00:30:17,033
No problem, Uncle.

375
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:18,033
Sorry, brother.

376
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,283
I will move back.

377
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:21,491
Though he looks tall and imposing,

378
00:30:21,575 --> 00:30:24,783
he doesn't even retaliate
when someone behaves rudely with him.

379
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:27,033
He doesn't mingle with anyone
or talk to anyone.

380
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,316
Neither does he get angry
despite eating so much chilli.

381
00:30:30,658 --> 00:30:32,366
But when he is with kids...

382
00:30:32,491 --> 00:30:33,783
he becomes one of them.

383
00:30:34,908 --> 00:30:36,033
What is this suspense?

384
00:30:36,116 --> 00:30:37,996
Should we wait for you so long
every single day?

385
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:41,908
Hey, like a batsman sent to bowl,
they gave me all sorts of assembling work.

386
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:43,751
Had they asked me
to disassemble something...

387
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,991
I would've done it in a single strike.

388
00:30:46,158 --> 00:30:47,825
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

389
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,116
Sixer!

390
00:30:53,283 --> 00:30:54,533
Salute!

391
00:30:57,908 --> 00:31:00,908
He hit a sixer against your bowling
and you are saluting him?

392
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,783
You are always playing with us.
Don't you have friends of your own?

393
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:08,200
Hey, pass me the ball.

394
00:31:54,158 --> 00:31:55,866
How many times should I tell you?

395
00:32:00,075 --> 00:32:01,700
You should be home by 6 in the evening.

396
00:32:01,825 --> 00:32:03,366
I told you once and isn't that enough?

397
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,533
Do I need to tell you this every day?

398
00:32:07,908 --> 00:32:09,658
If you repeat this...

399
00:32:11,075 --> 00:32:13,075
I won't be late from tomorrow, Mom.

400
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:06,908
Excuse me.

401
00:33:09,491 --> 00:33:12,366
Bilal said I can leave today.

402
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:15,075
Just one more day.

403
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,533
Should eliminate!

404
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:41,408
Should eliminate!

405
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,450
Should eliminate!

406
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:53,908
Stop!
Enough!

407
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:55,700
Stop... Just stop it!

408
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,366
Nobody can teach any of you.

409
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,575
Why?
Why are you doing this to me?

410
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,408
Very bad.
It's impossible to teach you.

411
00:34:02,616 --> 00:34:03,616
So bad!

412
00:34:04,991 --> 00:34:07,866
- Good morning, Teacher.
- Good morning, Teacher.

413
00:34:09,075 --> 00:34:10,075
Please, sit down.

414
00:34:10,741 --> 00:34:12,325
Your teacher seems tired.

415
00:34:12,491 --> 00:34:13,991
She cannot teach today.

416
00:34:14,075 --> 00:34:16,283
She will go to the market
and buy lights.

417
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:24,283
One run.

418
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:25,700
Where is the ball?

419
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:26,908
Look there.

420
00:34:43,075 --> 00:34:44,075
Hey!

421
00:34:44,158 --> 00:34:46,450
When did you start
playing cricket without me?

422
00:34:46,991 --> 00:34:48,071
Why don't you come to play?

423
00:34:48,116 --> 00:34:49,158
I will come tomorrow. Go.

424
00:34:49,283 --> 00:34:51,033
Hey, let's go.
Got the ball!

425
00:34:55,741 --> 00:34:57,658
You asked me to tell you if she goes out.

426
00:34:57,741 --> 00:35:00,283
Hitler has sent the English teacher
to the market.

427
00:35:02,866 --> 00:35:04,158
Hello, hello!
Madam!

428
00:35:05,116 --> 00:35:07,592
You brought everything for double
the price and where are you going?

429
00:35:07,616 --> 00:35:09,325
You are my property.

430
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:11,116
I am your owner.

431
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,491
Hey, you got a nice property, man.

432
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,575
Hey, leave her alone.

433
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,075
Hey! The hero is here.

434
00:35:23,908 --> 00:35:28,283
He is going to beat us all
and take her away.

435
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,616
Come on.

436
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,700
Hit me, come on, hit me.

437
00:35:33,825 --> 00:35:35,408
Hit me!

438
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:38,075
Hey, hit me!

439
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:40,366
My face is broken.

440
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:46,283
He thinks that he is a great hero.

441
00:36:06,825 --> 00:36:09,575
Hey, it's the cops!
Let's go.

442
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,283
The vehicle was last seen
near Navada toll in Bihar.

443
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,970
We don't know where
it went from there.

444
00:36:38,741 --> 00:36:40,700
Where could it have gone?

445
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,908
Send her photo to all our men.

446
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:45,438
I will send it immediately, sir.

447
00:36:46,616 --> 00:36:49,158
What is taking Hazare so long?

448
00:36:49,366 --> 00:36:52,950
Is he not capable of nabbing
even a girl?

449
00:36:53,116 --> 00:36:54,325
Madam, it's Nayak!

450
00:36:56,116 --> 00:36:56,991
What is it, Nayak?

451
00:36:57,075 --> 00:36:57,908
Obulamma...

452
00:36:57,991 --> 00:37:00,134
The consignment you were asking
about has arrived at Kandla Port.

453
00:37:00,158 --> 00:37:01,798
Tell me when the delivery should be made.

454
00:37:01,991 --> 00:37:05,283
Didn't I ask you to deliver it to Nepal?

455
00:37:05,741 --> 00:37:07,991
Don't call me again.

456
00:37:08,408 --> 00:37:09,408
Whatever comes up,

457
00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:11,366
Vedha will take care of it.

458
00:37:18,158 --> 00:37:19,075
That's it?

459
00:37:19,158 --> 00:37:21,741
Only these many?
They didn't even bring weapons with them.

460
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,866
That one man is enough.

461
00:37:26,616 --> 00:37:27,658
Hey, Nayak!

462
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:28,866
How are you?

463
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,551
It's a hundred million dollar consignment.

464
00:37:30,575 --> 00:37:31,450
A small one.

465
00:37:31,575 --> 00:37:34,241
But if you deliver this properly,
you will get many more big deals.

466
00:37:34,616 --> 00:37:36,700
You are the right guy for this job.

467
00:37:38,783 --> 00:37:40,366
Nepal!

468
00:37:41,658 --> 00:37:42,658
Fine.

469
00:37:43,075 --> 00:37:44,991
Then I will go and roam around Nepal.

470
00:37:48,116 --> 00:37:49,783
He doesn't even look interested.

471
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:51,033
Hey.

472
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,408
Don't disturb me until we reach Nepal.

473
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:54,950
Don't worry.

474
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:57,511
No one will stop the consignment
once he stamps that seal on it.

475
00:38:01,325 --> 00:38:03,408
Will he even be able
to get out of the port?

476
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:22,325
This is how you flush
a hundred million dollars down the toilet!

477
00:38:26,991 --> 00:38:28,325
Sir!

478
00:38:28,491 --> 00:38:30,033
The cops have surrounded us!

479
00:38:31,116 --> 00:38:32,116
Open it!

480
00:38:42,825 --> 00:38:43,950
Hey, close the door!

481
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:45,200
Close the door!

482
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,783
Hey, open the gate.

483
00:38:48,991 --> 00:38:49,991
Open it!

484
00:38:53,658 --> 00:38:54,783
What is it?

485
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:55,950
Nothing, sir.

486
00:38:59,408 --> 00:39:02,116
We got information about this
cocaine consignment one month ago.

487
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:04,283
Why did we let them go, sir?

488
00:39:07,408 --> 00:39:08,991
Did you see the seal?

489
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,825
Do you know where it came from?

490
00:39:15,283 --> 00:39:19,950
Before you could think of even saying
the name of the place, they will kill you.

491
00:39:22,658 --> 00:39:23,741
The seal?

492
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:25,241
Who stopped it?

493
00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:29,033
Call all the control rooms and tell them
that nobody should stop the seal.

494
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:30,491
What are you saying, sir?

495
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,783
The seal?

496
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,033
I shall inform right away.

497
00:39:36,116 --> 00:39:37,700
Inform everywhere immediately.

498
00:39:37,783 --> 00:39:38,783
Yes, sir.

499
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,325
I have heard about that place as a child.

500
00:39:43,116 --> 00:39:45,658
That some tribes rule the place.

501
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,283
That they have built huge
walls barring outsiders

502
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:53,658
and they have a strong army
and the most advanced weapons.

503
00:39:55,908 --> 00:39:58,491
But isn't that an urban legend?

504
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:04,241
I don't know if that place exists or not

505
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:15,866
but it true that I got scared
when I heard about it.

506
00:40:20,116 --> 00:40:21,200
I told you.

507
00:40:21,908 --> 00:40:23,325
There is nobody in India

508
00:40:23,991 --> 00:40:25,408
who can stop that seal.

509
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,533
Cutout...

510
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:36,450
Cutout...

511
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:37,950
Hey, I am painting.
Be careful.

512
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:40,533
Hey! Stop that.
It's my birthday today. Go!

513
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,075
Don't you know that you must
wish me exactly at midnight?

514
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,533
Sorry, Pari. I forgot about it.
Happy birthday.

515
00:40:47,658 --> 00:40:49,009
Okay, fine. Come.
Let's cut the cake.

516
00:40:49,033 --> 00:40:50,450
Come on!

517
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:52,467
- Let's cut the cake.
- It's your birthday. You should cut it.

518
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,450
No, you should cut the cake.

519
00:40:54,533 --> 00:40:55,717
- Hey, come on.
- No. It's your birthday...

520
00:40:55,741 --> 00:40:57,533
Hey, come on.
I am getting angry.

521
00:40:57,616 --> 00:40:59,366
- Come on, come.
- Hey!

522
00:41:04,741 --> 00:41:06,533
Hey! Move out, quick!

523
00:41:12,075 --> 00:41:13,075
Hey!

524
00:41:35,033 --> 00:41:36,200
That thing...

525
00:41:37,741 --> 00:41:39,200
Give it to me.

526
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,491
Just a small knife!

527
00:42:19,366 --> 00:42:20,783
That too a plastic knife.

528
00:42:30,075 --> 00:42:31,075
Vijay...

529
00:42:31,366 --> 00:42:32,366
Yes, Teacher?

530
00:42:32,866 --> 00:42:34,700
You remember the song I taught you?

531
00:42:34,991 --> 00:42:36,158
Yes, Teacher.

532
00:42:37,075 --> 00:42:38,075
Sing it.

533
00:42:39,741 --> 00:42:44,866
In every story it's the demon
Who unleashes violence

534
00:42:45,533 --> 00:42:50,783
And to oppress that demon
Rises a king...

535
00:42:51,158 --> 00:42:56,408
In his quest to quell the enemy
The king has embraced savagery

536
00:42:56,741 --> 00:43:02,075
He has made violence
A habit and forgotten how to smile

537
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:07,408
He slayed the monster,
Fighting resolutely

538
00:43:07,575 --> 00:43:12,991
Filled with ire, he has turned into
A monster himself

539
00:43:13,075 --> 00:43:18,575
If one has your courage
he will definitely succeed

540
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:24,616
Remember, oh skilled warrior,
Forgive and live on this land

541
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:30,116
Enough of anger
Now sing a song of love

542
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:35,241
Stop a war with a smile
And no more war and pain

543
00:43:35,658 --> 00:43:41,450
Climb up that rock
with the truth

544
00:43:41,616 --> 00:43:46,783
Your name is etched
all over that rock

545
00:43:47,116 --> 00:43:52,325
Whatever written over it

546
00:43:52,866 --> 00:43:57,866
Was erased in heavy rain

547
00:44:30,408 --> 00:44:31,908
Chandru, Chandru!

548
00:44:32,325 --> 00:44:33,366
Where did he go?

549
00:44:33,533 --> 00:44:35,575
He has to take
lunchbox to the coal mine.

550
00:44:35,658 --> 00:44:36,908
I shall take it.

551
00:44:38,908 --> 00:44:40,950
Let me be useful at least for this.

552
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:56,741
This girl?

553
00:44:58,366 --> 00:44:59,950
Sir, this girl is right here.

554
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:01,783
She is here in Tinsukia.

555
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,950
- What happened?
- We found the girl.

556
00:45:04,116 --> 00:45:06,325
She is in Tinsukia, Assam.

557
00:45:06,491 --> 00:45:07,325
Tinsukia?

558
00:45:07,408 --> 00:45:08,688
It is near the borders of Burma.

559
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:10,533
There is a coal mine on the outskirts.

560
00:45:10,658 --> 00:45:13,258
Majority of the people working
there have migrated from our place.

561
00:45:14,616 --> 00:45:16,325
Are there any CCTVs there?

562
00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:18,733
It's a very remote place, sir.

563
00:45:18,783 --> 00:45:20,463
They don't even have
banks or post offices.

564
00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:22,533
Then...

565
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,866
They must be there.

566
00:45:25,908 --> 00:45:28,366
- Sir?
- Leave for Tinsukia immediately.

567
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:29,450
Come on, guys.

568
00:45:30,283 --> 00:45:32,116
Who are you sending there?

569
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,200
I'm sending Selfie.

570
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:39,325
Sir.

571
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:41,616
Keep sending photographs from Tinsukia.

572
00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:42,908
Okay, sir.

573
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:44,158
Let's go.

574
00:45:47,366 --> 00:45:50,283
Oh, no!
This girl is good for nothing.

575
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:06,741
Actually, I was...

576
00:46:07,616 --> 00:46:08,658
I know.

577
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,116
There is only one more day, right?

578
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,866
- Hey, baby...
- Hey!

579
00:46:19,325 --> 00:46:20,325
Smile!

580
00:46:21,491 --> 00:46:23,200
Wow!
Amazing!

581
00:46:27,991 --> 00:46:29,075
Come.
Let's go.

582
00:46:29,408 --> 00:46:30,408
Hey!

583
00:46:37,158 --> 00:46:38,616
Help!

584
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,450
Is he her savior?

585
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,241
She must have mistaken him
for someone else.

586
00:46:50,616 --> 00:46:52,116
He is not capable of doing that.

587
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:10,325
My goodness! I don't know from
where the Sarpanch got this girl.

588
00:47:10,408 --> 00:47:11,801
She is absolutely good for nothing.

589
00:47:11,825 --> 00:47:13,491
She took one box and forgot the other.

590
00:47:13,575 --> 00:47:15,741
She never does anything right.
Where is she?

591
00:47:21,866 --> 00:47:22,866
Hey, hey!

592
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:25,325
Where are you dragging her?
Let her go!

593
00:47:25,408 --> 00:47:26,533
I'm talking to you.

594
00:47:28,991 --> 00:47:30,283
Why are you guys not helping?

595
00:47:30,366 --> 00:47:31,408
Go, save the girl.

596
00:47:35,658 --> 00:47:37,033
There are so many men here!

597
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,825
Can't any of you save her?

598
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:43,075
Oh, no!
Look, can no one save her?

599
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:45,825
Oh, no!
Anyone?

600
00:47:46,116 --> 00:47:48,158
Please, someone help her!

601
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:50,950
No one will stop them and no one can.

602
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,630
There is only one person
who can stop them.

603
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,075
And that's you.

604
00:48:02,408 --> 00:48:03,866
Oh, no!
So many...

605
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:05,491
There are so many men out here.

606
00:48:05,575 --> 00:48:06,950
Is no one capable?

607
00:48:07,033 --> 00:48:08,259
Your son is here as well, right?

608
00:48:08,283 --> 00:48:09,825
Why don't you ask him?
Isn't he a man?

609
00:48:14,408 --> 00:48:15,450
Oh, damn!

610
00:48:16,658 --> 00:48:18,158
We have left him behind.

611
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:20,950
Cut his head off and bring it to me.

612
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:33,200
The ash formed on the burning coal
needs to be blown away

613
00:48:34,741 --> 00:48:36,783
so that the heat inside can be felt.

614
00:48:44,116 --> 00:48:46,241
Hey, they are going to kill our cutout.

615
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:13,491
What can the poor guy do?

616
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,991
He is like an old rusty
vehicle that would never start.

617
00:49:26,575 --> 00:49:30,200
It was me who bound you
not to raise your hands on anyone.

618
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,741
Now, I set you free
from any bounds whatsoever.

619
00:49:44,491 --> 00:49:45,616
Deva!

620
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:51,116
Stop them!

621
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,450
You can even plead with them.

622
00:50:03,616 --> 00:50:05,908
Or make them bleed.

623
00:51:41,491 --> 00:51:43,533
Just one strike!

624
00:53:28,366 --> 00:53:29,741
Now your face is broken.

625
00:55:00,533 --> 00:55:02,933
Go upstairs and pack everything.
You need to go today itself.

626
00:55:13,575 --> 00:55:15,200
I am responsible for all of this.

627
00:55:15,366 --> 00:55:18,450
I had convinced Deva
that she would be safe here.

628
00:55:18,533 --> 00:55:20,658
I don't care about that.

629
00:55:21,491 --> 00:55:25,366
Right now, all that matters to me
are my son and I, nothing else.

630
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:28,866
Neither do I have the leisure
to think about anyone else's problems.

631
00:55:29,825 --> 00:55:32,491
Village after village, town after town,
city after city.

632
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:36,075
We were moving from one place to another.

633
00:55:36,783 --> 00:55:38,825
I thought we would find peace here.

634
00:55:39,991 --> 00:55:41,700
But now we have to get going again!

635
00:55:42,491 --> 00:55:44,033
Where should I go from here?

636
00:55:44,616 --> 00:55:47,033
Tell me, speak up.

637
00:55:48,616 --> 00:55:51,033
Because of you,
my son had to... again...

638
00:55:58,325 --> 00:56:00,366
Take that girl and go away, Bilal.

639
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:13,741
This is my mother.

640
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:19,366
I came to India for this.

641
00:56:20,158 --> 00:56:23,950
My mom always wanted to come to India.

642
00:56:24,116 --> 00:56:25,950
But my dad would never allow her.

643
00:56:27,366 --> 00:56:29,408
At least I have to fulfill
my mother's wish

644
00:56:30,283 --> 00:56:32,575
of scattering her ashes here.

645
00:56:34,616 --> 00:56:36,491
I know I have asked
you a lot, but...

646
00:56:38,866 --> 00:56:41,575
Can you do this
one last thing for me? Please...

647
00:56:49,491 --> 00:56:51,950
The children didn't like you, nor did I.

648
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,825
Take her away, Bilal.

649
00:57:14,241 --> 00:57:15,366
Obulamma.

650
00:57:15,991 --> 00:57:17,075
That girl...

651
00:57:20,075 --> 00:57:23,575
They are not capable of it.

652
00:57:31,825 --> 00:57:32,658
Hello.

653
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:34,301
There is a change
in the delivery point.

654
00:57:35,533 --> 00:57:38,741
There is a check post near Budherabad,
under the control of the local Maoists.

655
00:57:38,908 --> 00:57:40,741
They are our men.

656
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:43,575
Cross the check post and you
will reach the borders of Burma.

657
00:57:43,825 --> 00:57:45,283
Deliver it there.

658
00:57:45,741 --> 00:57:48,700
Along with that consignment,
you need to bring a girl as well.

659
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,200
Where is that girl now?

660
00:57:50,408 --> 00:57:53,658
On the way to that check post, you
will find a small town named Tinsukia.

661
00:57:55,366 --> 00:57:57,283
You should bring that girl from there.

662
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:03,033
It seems like we are lucky today.

663
00:58:04,866 --> 00:58:06,033
Turn the vehicle.

664
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:13,866
The delivery point has been changed.

665
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:16,825
Let's go there.

666
00:58:16,908 --> 00:58:17,825
Hey!

667
00:58:17,908 --> 00:58:19,825
Let's go to the Burma border.
Come on, let's go.

668
00:58:22,991 --> 00:58:24,051
Once you cross the border...

669
00:58:24,075 --> 00:58:25,616
It's okay, Deva.
I will take care.

670
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:32,533
Deva.

671
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,241
Let's get going.

672
00:58:47,033 --> 00:58:51,366
Should eliminate!

673
00:58:51,783 --> 00:58:53,450
Krishnakanth!

674
00:58:53,866 --> 00:58:55,700
It's been so long since I saw you.

675
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:57,366
How are you?

676
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:58,866
It's me that you want, right?

677
00:58:58,950 --> 00:58:59,950
I am here.

678
00:59:00,033 --> 00:59:02,866
Kill me if you want
but please spare my daughter.

679
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,700
- Seal...
- Okay, sir!

680
00:59:44,158 --> 00:59:45,158
Hey!

681
00:59:45,283 --> 00:59:48,408
Stamp the seal on the girl
and then put her in the truck.

682
00:59:56,991 --> 00:59:59,450
The girl must be already in the truck.

683
00:59:59,741 --> 01:00:01,450
and been stamped with the seal.

684
01:00:02,033 --> 01:00:04,450
They would be bringing her here.

685
01:00:12,616 --> 01:00:14,616
You will be killed anyway.

686
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:19,533
You must watch your daughter
die with your own eyes.

687
01:00:25,241 --> 01:00:27,825
She is not capable for this.
Find someone else.

688
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,200
Give me!

689
01:00:33,325 --> 01:00:35,908
The children didn't like you, nor did I.

690
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,366
Once we reach Burma, we
won't be able to escape.

691
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,741
Answer some of my questions first.

692
01:01:09,616 --> 01:01:11,533
Who are the people who want to kill me?

693
01:01:12,783 --> 01:01:14,158
What did my dad do to them?

694
01:01:15,616 --> 01:01:17,825
Why did they bring me to you?

695
01:01:18,533 --> 01:01:21,700
Why did his mother react
so much, over a plastic knife?

696
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:25,283
Why doesn't he cross
the boundaries set by her?

697
01:01:26,033 --> 01:01:27,408
And what is this?

698
01:02:01,866 --> 01:02:03,408
Hold somewhere tightly.

699
01:02:04,366 --> 01:02:05,366
What?

700
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:12,283
Obulamma.

701
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:17,575
If you know with whom
my daughter was all these days,

702
01:02:17,658 --> 01:02:19,116
you will release her.

703
01:02:37,366 --> 01:02:39,241
Hold there tightly.

704
01:03:59,075 --> 01:04:00,533
He stopped.

705
01:04:01,158 --> 01:04:02,366
He stopped the truck.

706
01:04:03,408 --> 01:04:04,825
He stopped the truck?

707
01:04:05,366 --> 01:04:06,533
Who the heck is he?

708
01:04:06,616 --> 01:04:08,825
You should have killed him on the spot.

709
01:04:18,408 --> 01:04:20,075
It's he.

710
01:04:20,575 --> 01:04:21,783
Devaratha!

711
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:53,658
Nobody can stop him.

712
01:05:26,991 --> 01:05:27,991
Hey.

713
01:05:44,908 --> 01:05:48,116
You can stop a river with a dam, but

714
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:56,200
how can you stop a mighty ocean?

715
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:12,450
I never told this even you, Obulamma.

716
01:06:12,658 --> 01:06:15,200
If I had, you would not have allowed me.

717
01:06:15,616 --> 01:06:18,241
Thanks to your daughter, I found him.

718
01:06:18,866 --> 01:06:21,825
Now he should be killed.

719
01:06:22,116 --> 01:06:25,241
But no one can do anything to him.

720
01:06:40,658 --> 01:06:43,908
That's why I put them
in that vehicle with seal

721
01:06:43,991 --> 01:06:46,783
and made Devaratha
stop that truck.

722
01:06:51,283 --> 01:06:52,950
The people who came to kill you...

723
01:06:53,033 --> 01:06:54,033
Your father...

724
01:06:54,116 --> 01:06:55,741
He, his mother...

725
01:06:56,075 --> 01:06:56,908
Me...

726
01:06:57,033 --> 01:06:59,200
And the seal.
All have only one thing in common.

727
01:07:00,033 --> 01:07:01,116
Khansaar.

728
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:12,116
Don't you know what happens
if someone stops that seal?

729
01:07:12,533 --> 01:07:16,658
Don't you know whose seal that is?

730
01:07:22,491 --> 01:07:23,908
Someone has stopped the seal.

731
01:07:25,825 --> 01:07:27,033
For the first time ever.

732
01:07:28,325 --> 01:07:30,450
- And the one who stopped it is...
- I know.

733
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,408
Varadha...

734
01:07:41,658 --> 01:07:43,741
Varadha Rajamannaar!

735
01:07:56,991 --> 01:08:00,033
No one other than him can stop it.

736
01:08:07,158 --> 01:08:08,158
Deva.

737
01:08:11,908 --> 01:08:14,033
Khansaar changed
the fate of a lot of people.

738
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,033
But, what changed
the fate of Khansaar was

739
01:08:16,366 --> 01:08:17,991
when two best friends

740
01:08:21,825 --> 01:08:23,991
became arch-rivals.

741
01:08:41,491 --> 01:08:43,450
My plan was amazing, wasn't it?

742
01:08:43,908 --> 01:08:47,491
Now a war will happen
between the two of them.

743
01:08:47,866 --> 01:08:50,075
And only one will survive.

744
01:08:54,658 --> 01:08:57,325
You said no one can stop that seal!

745
01:08:57,866 --> 01:08:59,783
The Salaar of Khansaar!

746
01:09:02,283 --> 01:09:04,158
No one can stop that seal.

747
01:09:04,325 --> 01:09:06,741
The Salaar to Varadha Rajamannaar.

748
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,825
But he is the one who created that seal!

749
01:09:13,575 --> 01:09:17,491
Salaar Devaratha Raisaar!

750
01:09:44,491 --> 01:09:45,866
What will happen now?

751
01:09:50,908 --> 01:09:52,825
It's the rule he set.

752
01:09:54,408 --> 01:09:55,991
Whoever breaks it must die!

753
01:09:56,075 --> 01:09:57,616
Up...
Up...

754
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:01,200
I am here for you.

755
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:03,200
That is the rule.

756
01:10:10,866 --> 01:10:13,200
Some stories are frightening to listen to.

757
01:10:17,825 --> 01:10:20,158
Some stories are frightening to watch.

758
01:10:25,533 --> 01:10:27,200
Some stories are frightening

759
01:10:28,283 --> 01:10:29,783
to even think of.

760
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,408
Do you want to listen to his story?

761
01:10:59,325 --> 01:11:01,658
This story began a thousand years ago.

762
01:11:02,575 --> 01:11:06,825
Dacoits more savage than Mahmud Ghazni
and Genghis Khan lived back then.

763
01:11:09,366 --> 01:11:11,616
They would not just loot the villages

764
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,825
but would burn them to ashes.

765
01:11:15,158 --> 01:11:18,158
They took all that they looted,
back to Khansaar.

766
01:11:20,033 --> 01:11:21,033
Khansaar!

767
01:11:21,658 --> 01:11:24,366
A forest situated between
mountains and the ocean.

768
01:11:24,616 --> 01:11:27,325
There were three tribes
among those dacoits.

769
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:29,366
The Mannaar tribe.

770
01:11:30,366 --> 01:11:31,616
The Shouryaanga tribe.

771
01:11:33,616 --> 01:11:34,950
And the Ghaniyaar tribe.

772
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:39,283
The three tribes flourished and prospered
unchallenged for hundreds of years.

773
01:11:39,366 --> 01:11:42,116
They turned that forest
into a formidable fortress.

774
01:11:44,408 --> 01:11:45,408
Fire!

775
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:48,325
The British who could
reigned over the entire world

776
01:11:48,866 --> 01:11:51,325
could occupy the whole of India but...

777
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:53,491
in Khansaar...

778
01:11:53,741 --> 01:11:55,616
they couldn't even set foot.

779
01:11:58,991 --> 01:12:03,325
Every time the British attempted to do
so, they ended up losing their own army.

780
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:13,741
After Independence, the newly
formed nation had a huge issue.

781
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:16,116
What should be done about Khansaar?

782
01:12:17,241 --> 01:12:20,575
The then leader of the three
tribes, Shiva Mannaar went to Delhi.

783
01:12:20,783 --> 01:12:23,575
He erased Khansaar from India's map.

784
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:27,408
He warned that the Constitution of India
won't be applicable to Khansaar

785
01:12:27,491 --> 01:12:31,408
but every rule set by Khansaar
would be applicable to India.

786
01:12:33,908 --> 01:12:36,283
Money generated through all
the illegal activities in India

787
01:12:36,366 --> 01:12:38,783
like smuggling, gambling,
money laundering, drugs,

788
01:12:38,866 --> 01:12:40,450
land petroleum, fake currency

789
01:12:40,533 --> 01:12:44,241
and arms deal, were dealt by the agents

790
01:12:44,325 --> 01:12:46,408
as per the percentage fixed by Khansaar.

791
01:12:46,908 --> 01:12:49,092
To prevent the law and order
from interfering with their activity,

792
01:12:49,116 --> 01:12:51,075
they began to dictate politics.

793
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:53,116
Fear...

794
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:56,158
Because of this weapon they had created,

795
01:12:56,241 --> 01:12:58,075
no one dared to confront them.

796
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:04,908
People feared to even say
the name "Khansaar".

797
01:13:07,658 --> 01:13:09,741
They turned this business
into a most profitable one

798
01:13:09,825 --> 01:13:12,075
by investing in the emotion of fear.

799
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:15,366
Fully aware of the violent nature
of the tribes,

800
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:18,825
Shivmannaar decided bring Khansaar, which
was progressing to affluence,

801
01:13:18,908 --> 01:13:20,450
under a common law.

802
01:13:22,325 --> 01:13:25,366
Drafting a set of rules to be
strictly adhered to by everyone,

803
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:27,866
and named that book "Constitution".

804
01:13:28,783 --> 01:13:30,241
And according to Constitution

805
01:13:30,491 --> 01:13:32,700
he divided Khansaar into 101 parts

806
01:13:33,033 --> 01:13:35,533
and appointed leaders for each part.

807
01:13:35,658 --> 01:13:38,825
He crafted a bracelet
as a symbol of their authority.

808
01:13:39,325 --> 01:13:41,991
He then divided the leaders
into three major groups.

809
01:13:42,241 --> 01:13:45,575
He named sixty-one leaders with only
one vote each as "Governors"

810
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:49,075
and eight leaders with at least
three votes each as "Lords".

811
01:13:52,033 --> 01:13:54,325
And with 15 votes for himself,

812
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:57,366
Shivmannaar pronounced himself
as the King of Khansaar.

813
01:14:01,033 --> 01:14:02,991
One day, Shivmannaar died.

814
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:09,575
As per the agreement between
the three tribes,

815
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:10,991
after Shivmannaar's death,

816
01:14:11,075 --> 01:14:14,616
Dhaara, leader of Shouryaanga tribe,
was supposed to become the king.

817
01:14:16,283 --> 01:14:20,908
But, Rajamannaar did not to give
his father's throne to anyone else.

818
01:14:22,033 --> 01:14:24,366
How dare they want to have my throne!

819
01:14:25,741 --> 01:14:28,866
Not a single soul from
Shouryaanga tribe should be spared.

820
01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:32,533
Can we confront them?

821
01:14:32,616 --> 01:14:35,575
There is only one way to eliminate them.

822
01:14:38,616 --> 01:14:40,866
Men, women, elderly and children...

823
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:43,825
Kill all of them while
they are asleep.

824
01:14:46,116 --> 01:14:48,075
If even one life is spared,

825
01:14:48,616 --> 01:14:51,033
the Shouryaangas' vengeance
will be unimaginable.

826
01:15:00,741 --> 01:15:02,575
Why are you...

827
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:28,158
Thus, the Shouryaanga tribe
was completely eliminated.

828
01:15:30,616 --> 01:15:33,866
Fearing another massacre,
everyone else bowed to Rajamannar.

829
01:15:34,866 --> 01:15:37,408
He built a huge fort around Khansaar,

830
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,491
deployed a strong army,

831
01:15:40,575 --> 01:15:42,741
and made Khansaar
a formidable force.

832
01:15:52,033 --> 01:15:54,783
Rajamannaar, along with 61 Governors,

833
01:15:55,575 --> 01:15:57,783
gave five out of eight Lord positions

834
01:15:57,866 --> 01:16:00,158
to the Ghaniyaar tribe.

835
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:03,450
Vaali.

836
01:16:04,658 --> 01:16:05,658
Gurung.

837
01:16:06,491 --> 01:16:07,491
Cheeka.

838
01:16:09,408 --> 01:16:10,408
Ranga.

839
01:16:11,991 --> 01:16:12,991
And Naarang.

840
01:16:14,325 --> 01:16:17,575
He gave the remaining three
Lord positions to his family members.

841
01:16:17,741 --> 01:16:20,741
Om, Rajamannaar's
first wife's elder brother.

842
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:24,450
Bhaarava, Rajamannaar's son-in-law.

843
01:16:25,741 --> 01:16:29,158
Rudra, Rajamannaar's son
by his first wife.

844
01:16:30,283 --> 01:16:31,283
Radha Rama.

845
01:16:31,866 --> 01:16:33,950
Rajamannaar's daughter
by his first wife.

846
01:16:34,283 --> 01:16:37,866
Rajamannaar's honor and pride.

847
01:16:38,533 --> 01:16:41,908
Though there were a lot of differences
among the Lords and Governors

848
01:16:42,325 --> 01:16:45,241
nobody dared to go
against Rajamannaar's will.

849
01:16:47,866 --> 01:16:51,283
These people, who were synonymous
for violence for over a 1,000 years

850
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:53,575
lived a peaceful life for 25 years

851
01:16:53,825 --> 01:16:54,825
until that day.

852
01:16:56,575 --> 01:16:58,241
Father, is it true?

853
01:16:58,533 --> 01:17:00,241
Are you going out of Khansaar?

854
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,491
I will go instead, if necessary.

855
01:17:03,158 --> 01:17:06,325
Temples were built to propagate religion.

856
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:13,783
Kingdoms are ruled to propagate legacy.

857
01:17:15,241 --> 01:17:18,950
Khansaar is built
to propagate only one thing...

858
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:21,700
Fear.

859
01:17:22,825 --> 01:17:25,241
I have maintained it until now.

860
01:17:25,325 --> 01:17:27,866
No one should cross that line of fear.

861
01:17:28,033 --> 01:17:29,991
Who is crossing that line now?

862
01:17:31,033 --> 01:17:33,241
I am going out
of Khansaar to find that out.

863
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:37,533
Rama, until I come back, I am
leaving Khansaar under your watch.

864
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:41,116
And I am sure that
you will take care of it well.

865
01:17:42,075 --> 01:17:43,075
Okay, Father.

866
01:17:48,783 --> 01:17:49,783
My King.

867
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:53,241
I know that nobody will
disobey your decisions.

868
01:17:53,658 --> 01:17:56,783
But, as your son-in-law,
I would like to ask you something.

869
01:17:57,241 --> 01:17:59,075
Can't you forgive him at least now?

870
01:17:59,158 --> 01:18:02,033
- Whom?
- Your son.

871
01:18:03,825 --> 01:18:04,825
Varadha.

872
01:18:04,908 --> 01:18:07,658
Did you give up your bracelet so easily?

873
01:18:10,283 --> 01:18:11,658
Why did you do that?

874
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:17,575
He threw away the honor I gave him.

875
01:18:18,658 --> 01:18:20,950
He lost his right to be my son.

876
01:18:21,033 --> 01:18:22,700
But, he was just a ten-year-old.

877
01:18:22,783 --> 01:18:24,575
Why are you justifying him?

878
01:18:26,575 --> 01:18:30,658
Because no one else has the courage
to stand in front of you and say this.

879
01:18:30,825 --> 01:18:35,950
Because, even now, you leave a chair
vacant for Varadha on your dining table.

880
01:18:37,116 --> 01:18:41,075
Whenever I see your father Shivmannaar,

881
01:18:41,241 --> 01:18:43,616
he reminds me of
Varadha... because of that!

882
01:18:43,908 --> 01:18:46,575
He is also your blood, my King.

883
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:51,616
He also deserves the authority
which Rudra has got.

884
01:18:54,616 --> 01:18:58,283
For the past 30 years,
I have been sitting on this throne

885
01:18:58,366 --> 01:19:02,325
and taking decisions only for Khansaar.

886
01:19:03,783 --> 01:19:08,241
For the first time,
I am making a decision for myself.

887
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:13,866
All I want is one of your chairs.

888
01:19:17,158 --> 01:19:19,366
You are the only one who would give me

889
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:21,866
anything I ask for,
without any conditions.

890
01:19:22,325 --> 01:19:24,158
Hence, I am asking you...

891
01:19:24,783 --> 01:19:25,908
Ranga!

892
01:19:29,783 --> 01:19:36,491
I wish to see my son, Varadha Rajamannaar,
as a Lord while I am still alive.

893
01:19:40,825 --> 01:19:41,658
Varadha...

894
01:19:41,741 --> 01:19:43,866
The son of Rajamannaar's second wife.

895
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:46,616
As he had given up his bracelet
when he was a child,

896
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,408
he couldn't become a Lord.

897
01:19:48,491 --> 01:19:50,866
Though he was demoted as a Governor,

898
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:54,450
he always lived
with the confidence of a Lord.

899
01:19:55,825 --> 01:19:57,408
Will you give it to me, Ranga?

900
01:20:02,366 --> 01:20:04,075
You shouldn't request, my King.

901
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,283
You should only command.

902
01:20:08,491 --> 01:20:12,658
I am going out of Khansaar
on a very important errand.

903
01:20:13,366 --> 01:20:17,783
Once I come back, all the formalities
for making Varadha Rajamannaar a Lord

904
01:20:17,908 --> 01:20:19,825
should be done by you, Bali.

905
01:20:19,908 --> 01:20:20,908
Yes, my King!

906
01:20:51,283 --> 01:20:55,866
Do you know why he asked
for your chair out of all of us, Ranga?

907
01:20:57,408 --> 01:20:58,908
I am sure you know it.

908
01:21:04,366 --> 01:21:07,658
Your father picked up the bracelet
he threw on the ground

909
01:21:07,783 --> 01:21:09,991
and became a Lord

910
01:21:10,575 --> 01:21:16,450
He did not earn it. It was thrown at him
like a piece of bone to a stray dog.

911
01:21:16,533 --> 01:21:18,700
But my dad had genuinely won that day!

912
01:21:18,783 --> 01:21:21,533
Had he asked for my life,
I would have willingly given.

913
01:21:21,866 --> 01:21:23,575
How can I give away my chair?

914
01:21:24,033 --> 01:21:25,075
Give it up.

915
01:21:26,825 --> 01:21:28,408
Will you give it up...

916
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:29,950
Ranga?

917
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,991
King Rajamannaar's orders

918
01:21:33,825 --> 01:21:35,325
cannot be defied.

919
01:21:35,866 --> 01:21:39,450
There is another order
more powerful than Rajamannaar's orders.

920
01:21:40,075 --> 01:21:41,616
Khansaar Constitution.

921
01:21:42,658 --> 01:21:45,700
And in that book, there
is a very important rule.

922
01:21:46,491 --> 01:21:48,366
"The strongest shall prevail.

923
01:21:48,991 --> 01:21:50,366
"The strongest shall...

924
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:52,866
rule."

925
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,033
Ranga, yours is a new vengeance.

926
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:59,950
But Rudra's vengeance started
from the time Varadha was born.

927
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:03,866
You might be wondering why I'm showing
so much concern for you.

928
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,880
Today he asked you to give away
your chair.

929
01:22:05,908 --> 01:22:07,408
Tomorrow it could be my turn.

930
01:22:07,491 --> 01:22:10,075
But that is not what
the Constitution says.

931
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:13,283
I may beat you.
Then you beat me.

932
01:22:14,575 --> 01:22:15,575
Let us fight.

933
01:22:17,033 --> 01:22:19,200
The strongest shall have the country.

934
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,450
The strongest shall have

935
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:23,866
the chair.

936
01:22:26,116 --> 01:22:28,116
Is Rudra off to kill Varadha?

937
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:29,575
I can't believe this.

938
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:33,200
Rudra has sent for Pandit.

939
01:22:33,283 --> 01:22:34,283
Pandit?

940
01:22:44,366 --> 01:22:46,033
When Rajamannaar returns

941
01:22:46,991 --> 01:22:48,658
Varadha will be made a Lord.

942
01:22:49,616 --> 01:22:52,450
Our Brother is a Lord now!

943
01:22:52,533 --> 01:22:54,950
But by the time Rajamannaar returns,

944
01:22:55,283 --> 01:22:56,991
what if Varadha is not alive?

945
01:23:08,116 --> 01:23:10,116
The strongest shall have the country.

946
01:23:12,491 --> 01:23:14,866
The strongest shall have the chair.

947
01:23:46,325 --> 01:23:47,325
Ranga...

948
01:23:48,741 --> 01:23:50,575
You want to slit his throat.

949
01:23:51,075 --> 01:23:54,366
But I want the Mannaar authority
that he has.

950
01:24:12,616 --> 01:24:14,283
The Constitution!

951
01:24:21,991 --> 01:24:23,491
Rudra, it's the Constitution!

952
01:24:24,241 --> 01:24:25,491
No one should disobey it.

953
01:24:35,658 --> 01:24:37,200
Who?
Who stopped me?

954
01:24:38,408 --> 01:24:40,116
Who stopped me?

955
01:24:41,158 --> 01:24:42,408
Hey!

956
01:24:48,033 --> 01:24:51,366
At the court of our King Rajamannaar,

957
01:24:52,116 --> 01:24:54,408
in his presence or absence,

958
01:24:54,658 --> 01:24:57,450
no one shall raise
their voice or run their mouth.

959
01:24:59,075 --> 01:25:00,575
It was me who stopped you.

960
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:03,575
How can you to take that decision?

961
01:25:04,616 --> 01:25:09,116
Because I am representing the King now,
and that's why all of you are still alive.

962
01:25:09,616 --> 01:25:11,741
If it was the King,

963
01:25:12,533 --> 01:25:16,158
all of you would have been
beheaded by now.

964
01:25:16,991 --> 01:25:18,033
Bali!

965
01:25:18,158 --> 01:25:19,200
Madam!

966
01:25:19,533 --> 01:25:23,450
In order to stop any sort of violence

967
01:25:23,533 --> 01:25:27,991
between the Lords and
the Governors of Khansaar,

968
01:25:28,325 --> 01:25:30,575
I am imposing a ceasefire.

969
01:25:31,325 --> 01:25:33,658
On the orders of the acting King,

970
01:25:33,825 --> 01:25:37,366
a ceasefire is imposed
in Khansaar from today!

971
01:25:42,658 --> 01:25:43,866
The Constitution.

972
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:50,783
All stand equal before
the Khansaar Constitution.

973
01:25:51,991 --> 01:25:55,658
The book has given all of us
the authority to defy

974
01:25:55,741 --> 01:25:58,283
even our king at any circumstances.

975
01:26:00,491 --> 01:26:02,658
I, Rudra Rajamannaar,

976
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:08,200
in the rank of a Lord, propose
a voting to lift the imposed ceasefire!

977
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:19,366
As per the Khansaar Constitution,

978
01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:23,616
after nine days, a voting will be
held in Kotagada to decide

979
01:26:23,741 --> 01:26:29,158
whether the ceasefire should be
withdrawn or sustained.

980
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:37,116
No one waited
until the voting day.

981
01:26:37,366 --> 01:26:39,866
Right from the Lords to the Governors,

982
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:44,033
everyone began to deploy
the most merciless and powerful armies.

983
01:27:05,783 --> 01:27:07,408
Rudra brought Pandit along.

984
01:27:07,658 --> 01:27:09,450
Naarang assembled Russian soldiers.

985
01:27:09,908 --> 01:27:11,991
Gurung assembled the Serbians.

986
01:27:12,283 --> 01:27:15,700
Even the Governors
gathered at least 50 suicide killers.

987
01:27:15,825 --> 01:27:18,116
Today, there were about
700 new entries at the gate.

988
01:27:18,325 --> 01:27:20,866
Not sure how many more armies
might enter Khansaar.

989
01:27:27,991 --> 01:27:30,533
Do you know how intimidating
each one of them are?

990
01:27:34,658 --> 01:27:36,575
And the kind of weapons
they carry...

991
01:27:42,450 --> 01:27:43,533
You tell me.

992
01:27:45,158 --> 01:27:46,825
Which army are we bringing?

993
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:49,450
Tell me.

994
01:27:50,825 --> 01:27:52,908
Where is our army?

995
01:27:56,408 --> 01:27:58,075
Brother, tell me please.

996
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:02,241
Where is our army?

997
01:28:20,325 --> 01:28:22,408
We also set out to bring an army.

998
01:28:36,033 --> 01:28:39,366
In just one jeep and
with only one vacant seat.

999
01:28:43,908 --> 01:28:49,158
Even I was curious to see the army
that was supposed to fit in that seat.

1000
01:29:18,533 --> 01:29:19,741
Hey, Deva!

1001
01:29:19,908 --> 01:29:22,450
Varadha, my dad will skin me alive
if I go out now.

1002
01:29:22,533 --> 01:29:23,908
I am not coming.
You can leave.

1003
01:29:23,991 --> 01:29:25,950
- Hey...
- I said I can't.

1004
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:32,866
Deva...

1005
01:29:35,991 --> 01:29:37,116
Do you remember me?

1006
01:29:40,866 --> 01:29:42,408
Only your voice has changed.

1007
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:45,116
Not the way you call me.

1008
01:29:46,658 --> 01:29:50,158
Other than my mother,

1009
01:29:50,325 --> 01:29:53,241
only one person calls me Deva.

1010
01:29:55,825 --> 01:29:57,825
Varadha Rajamannaar.

1011
01:30:35,158 --> 01:30:36,325
How are you, mother?

1012
01:30:41,366 --> 01:30:42,366
I am starving.

1013
01:30:43,741 --> 01:30:45,158
Cook something for me.

1014
01:30:46,450 --> 01:30:48,700
It's been so long since I ate your food.

1015
01:31:04,783 --> 01:31:05,783
Hey...

1016
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,950
I told you to leave.
Why are you still here?

1017
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,200
Hey... Where is your nose ring?

1018
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:23,116
It's... You...

1019
01:31:30,741 --> 01:31:31,908
Who took it?

1020
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,616
Let me tell my mother.
I will come.

1021
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:39,616
Varadha wanted
to take Deva with him at any cost.

1022
01:31:41,325 --> 01:31:44,158
But Deva's mother had
decided not to send him along.

1023
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,200
Mother!

1024
01:31:59,825 --> 01:32:01,783
- I think Varadha needs me...
- But...

1025
01:32:23,825 --> 01:32:24,825
Go with him...

1026
01:32:25,075 --> 01:32:26,241
Let's go get it.

1027
01:33:32,908 --> 01:33:34,908
- Sir...
- Need to make an entry.

1028
01:33:43,616 --> 01:33:46,866
- Rani... Rani...
- Surabhi!

1029
01:33:47,158 --> 01:33:50,241
Don't cry!
Don't cry, dear!

1030
01:33:50,325 --> 01:33:51,616
Please, let her go.

1031
01:33:51,783 --> 01:33:53,408
She will never come back.

1032
01:33:55,075 --> 01:33:56,241
How many persons, sir?

1033
01:33:57,158 --> 01:33:58,283
Only one.

1034
01:34:05,991 --> 01:34:07,741
Isn't there anyone else, sir?

1035
01:34:07,866 --> 01:34:09,200
I won't need anyone else.

1036
01:34:16,741 --> 01:34:17,741
Surabhi!

1037
01:34:18,533 --> 01:34:19,575
What is his name?

1038
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:20,616
Devaratha.

1039
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:21,533
Which tribe?

1040
01:34:21,616 --> 01:34:22,908
He is an outsider.

1041
01:34:24,616 --> 01:34:25,700
Take his prints.

1042
01:34:26,075 --> 01:34:29,116
I am praying to our Goddess to save us.

1043
01:34:30,033 --> 01:34:34,991
Dear, no matter how much we pray,
no God would set foot on this sinful land.

1044
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:38,033
How many times should I tell you?

1045
01:34:50,366 --> 01:34:52,991
He got scared just by looking
at the entrance gate.

1046
01:34:54,241 --> 01:34:55,533
Be careful, sir.

1047
01:34:55,616 --> 01:34:57,741
Whoever steps inside

1048
01:34:57,825 --> 01:34:59,408
never comes out.

1049
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:07,283
Dear, whom are you praying to?

1050
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:15,116
Huge walls are built out of fear.

1051
01:35:16,491 --> 01:35:18,408
Not out of fear of those going out...

1052
01:35:18,491 --> 01:35:20,283
You said God won't come to save us.

1053
01:35:20,366 --> 01:35:22,575
So, I am praying
in the opposite direction.

1054
01:35:23,866 --> 01:35:26,325
...but out of fear of those coming in.

1055
01:35:29,075 --> 01:35:31,783
Let's see if at least the demon
comes to our rescue.

1056
01:35:32,116 --> 01:35:35,950
After 25 years, in order to
keep the promise he had made...

1057
01:35:36,283 --> 01:35:38,658
he came back
to the land of his birth.

1058
01:37:05,575 --> 01:37:07,075
- Baba, this is...
- I know.

1059
01:37:11,950 --> 01:37:14,908
Don't look around.
No one else will be coming.

1060
01:37:15,866 --> 01:37:16,866
Of course, I know.

1061
01:37:20,991 --> 01:37:23,671
Varadha has made an entry
in the register for his army at the gates.

1062
01:37:23,991 --> 01:37:27,033
Only one entry must
has been made at the gate.

1063
01:37:27,866 --> 01:37:29,241
Only one?

1064
01:37:34,658 --> 01:37:36,325
You brought only one man?

1065
01:37:36,616 --> 01:37:39,700
We needed a whole army,
and you brought just one?

1066
01:37:39,783 --> 01:37:41,616
- Him, of all people?
- I forgot to ask.

1067
01:37:41,783 --> 01:37:43,943
Did you make all the arrangements
for Deva's stay here?

1068
01:37:44,533 --> 01:37:45,616
Yes, I did.

1069
01:37:49,116 --> 01:37:50,325
Have you forgotten?

1070
01:37:51,241 --> 01:37:55,700
It's because of that one decision
you made for him 25 years ago

1071
01:37:57,491 --> 01:37:59,616
our lives are so miserable even today.

1072
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:04,616
And yet you have brought him back.

1073
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:06,741
- Have food.
- You be quiet, Baba.

1074
01:38:08,991 --> 01:38:11,158
- Even now he could...
- Rinda!

1075
01:38:11,783 --> 01:38:14,366
Tell Satthi that the curry
is not spicy enough.

1076
01:38:14,533 --> 01:38:15,658
Deva won't like it.

1077
01:38:15,741 --> 01:38:18,158
Tell him to add some chilli
before you serve him.

1078
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:23,366
Everyone in Khansaar

1079
01:38:23,575 --> 01:38:29,283
desperately wants to hack us to pieces.

1080
01:38:31,241 --> 01:38:32,741
Do you know that?

1081
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:46,700
Father, why are you in a hurry
to take such a decision?

1082
01:38:47,241 --> 01:38:49,991
I want you to sit on that chair
while I am still alive

1083
01:38:50,158 --> 01:38:51,878
and fulfill my wish
of seeing you as a Lord.

1084
01:38:51,950 --> 01:38:53,366
- But, Dad...
- Hey...

1085
01:38:53,866 --> 01:38:56,866
Until now, I have fulfilled all
your wishes even before you asked.

1086
01:38:57,450 --> 01:38:59,408
Just fulfill this one wish of mine.

1087
01:39:01,825 --> 01:39:02,825
Vishnu!

1088
01:39:04,241 --> 01:39:06,825
Rudra Mannaar has sent you a message.

1089
01:39:06,991 --> 01:39:07,991
Lord Rudra?

1090
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,241
I will do anything for him.
What is it?

1091
01:39:10,825 --> 01:39:13,741
He asked you to give Varadha
sleepless nights.

1092
01:39:17,450 --> 01:39:19,408
Baba, we are going out.

1093
01:39:19,950 --> 01:39:21,325
Please call Deva as well...

1094
01:39:21,408 --> 01:39:23,616
There's so many of us.
Why do we need him?

1095
01:39:23,991 --> 01:39:24,991
Hey... Come.

1096
01:39:30,908 --> 01:39:31,908
Go, get him.

1097
01:39:32,158 --> 01:39:33,866
I will hit you!

1098
01:39:34,033 --> 01:39:35,075
Go!

1099
01:39:42,158 --> 01:39:43,158
Lord!

1100
01:39:43,825 --> 01:39:46,033
Why are you walking, my Lord?

1101
01:39:46,658 --> 01:39:48,158
Hey, hold an umbrella for him.

1102
01:39:49,658 --> 01:39:50,866
Where is the umbrella?

1103
01:39:59,158 --> 01:40:01,325
I know our present condition very well.

1104
01:40:02,283 --> 01:40:04,950
I also know that we have
only enemies around us.

1105
01:40:05,158 --> 01:40:06,158
Hey...

1106
01:40:09,575 --> 01:40:10,575
What is it?

1107
01:40:11,783 --> 01:40:13,950
More than the fear of getting killed,

1108
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:18,491
I dread the humiliation
that we are yet to suffer.

1109
01:40:21,908 --> 01:40:22,908
Who is that?

1110
01:40:30,366 --> 01:40:34,366
All of them are desperately
waiting to chop your head off.

1111
01:40:34,741 --> 01:40:38,283
I feel like chopping off your head

1112
01:40:38,366 --> 01:40:41,408
right now, right here.

1113
01:40:42,158 --> 01:40:44,033
If we want to stay alive here...

1114
01:40:44,408 --> 01:40:47,241
however large an army we get,
it won't be enough.

1115
01:40:47,825 --> 01:40:51,366
In Khansaar, nothing can be
calculated using a calculator.

1116
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:07,200
That's why I brought a maniac
who is totally unpredictable.

1117
01:41:13,616 --> 01:41:15,241
But, what is he going to do?

1118
01:41:17,866 --> 01:41:18,991
Hold the gun tight.

1119
01:41:19,241 --> 01:41:21,866
Keep your body upright
while pulling the trigger.

1120
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:23,741
Safety...

1121
01:41:24,450 --> 01:41:26,658
you can fire after unlocking
the safety lock.

1122
01:41:26,825 --> 01:41:31,283
A mechanic only knows how to use
a spanner and a wrench.

1123
01:41:31,408 --> 01:41:33,450
What is the use of giving him a gun?

1124
01:42:25,783 --> 01:42:26,908
That's it, right?

1125
01:42:41,033 --> 01:42:42,075
Let's go.

1126
01:42:44,783 --> 01:42:46,033
Why are you here, my Lord?

1127
01:42:47,033 --> 01:42:50,325
Hey, I don't see any vacant tables?

1128
01:42:50,658 --> 01:42:52,450
I will get the tables ready
at once, my Lord.

1129
01:42:56,116 --> 01:42:59,450
At times, I feel it's better
that he doesn't do anything.

1130
01:43:06,366 --> 01:43:09,616
Fold your hands, all of you!
Don't you know the procedure?

1131
01:43:18,491 --> 01:43:19,491
Mother...

1132
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:27,450
Where are you going?

1133
01:43:27,533 --> 01:43:29,366
We have some other work, let's go.

1134
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:31,283
- Hey, there...
- Come on, come...

1135
01:43:31,616 --> 01:43:32,616
Ganga...

1136
01:43:41,616 --> 01:43:43,783
Rudra on one hand and Ranga on the other.

1137
01:43:43,866 --> 01:43:46,866
Now, my son Vishnu
as well is troubling you.

1138
01:43:46,950 --> 01:43:49,825
It's sad to see Rajamannaar's son
going through all these.

1139
01:43:49,908 --> 01:43:50,908
Do one thing.

1140
01:43:51,575 --> 01:43:54,158
Chop your head off
and place it at my feet.

1141
01:44:06,241 --> 01:44:07,325
It's my mistake.

1142
01:44:08,408 --> 01:44:09,491
I didn't notice.

1143
01:44:30,991 --> 01:44:32,533
How long would you tolerate this?

1144
01:44:34,991 --> 01:44:37,200
Even I don't know how long

1145
01:44:39,158 --> 01:44:40,575
I can hold him back.

1146
01:44:52,658 --> 01:44:53,866
Hey, leave me.

1147
01:44:54,783 --> 01:44:58,033
Khansaar's king,
Rajamannaar's son...

1148
01:44:58,158 --> 01:44:59,783
Varadha Rajamannaar!

1149
01:45:00,241 --> 01:45:01,950
See my plight now!

1150
01:45:06,158 --> 01:45:09,075
I have absolutely no value here.

1151
01:45:09,158 --> 01:45:10,491
What are you saying?

1152
01:45:10,575 --> 01:45:13,700
- Baba.
- Didn't you hear that?

1153
01:45:13,908 --> 01:45:17,158
Deva!
Please sit down... please...

1154
01:45:19,325 --> 01:45:23,616
None of my people are happy
that I brought you here.

1155
01:45:27,991 --> 01:45:29,908
They are just not saying it out loud.

1156
01:45:30,825 --> 01:45:32,950
But I'm sure they are cursing me.

1157
01:45:34,075 --> 01:45:38,408
Nobody even bothered to
ask me why I brought you here.

1158
01:45:39,366 --> 01:45:43,200
- You won't ask me.
- Brother, you've had enough.

1159
01:45:43,325 --> 01:45:44,325
Let's go.

1160
01:45:45,241 --> 01:45:49,575
Hey... come here, my dearest brother...

1161
01:45:49,658 --> 01:45:53,116
Brother!
Let me go, brother.

1162
01:45:55,366 --> 01:45:57,658
Hey, you guys bring him home.

1163
01:45:57,825 --> 01:45:59,158
Baachi!

1164
01:46:04,491 --> 01:46:06,366
I am really scared, my friend.

1165
01:46:09,741 --> 01:46:12,283
Not that something will happen to me.

1166
01:46:13,283 --> 01:46:17,575
Not that the little honor
I have left will be taken away.

1167
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:24,950
I am only worried
about my younger brother.

1168
01:46:27,158 --> 01:46:29,408
You must make sure
nothing happens to him.

1169
01:46:32,616 --> 01:46:33,616
Hey...

1170
01:46:36,658 --> 01:46:38,075
You must look after him.

1171
01:46:40,033 --> 01:46:41,575
You must take care of him...

1172
01:46:44,450 --> 01:46:45,450
Move your hand.

1173
01:46:47,075 --> 01:46:50,408
You must take care of him.

1174
01:46:51,616 --> 01:46:53,491
When I am gone...

1175
01:46:54,575 --> 01:46:55,575
he...

1176
01:46:56,575 --> 01:46:57,575
Deva!

1177
01:47:07,491 --> 01:47:09,950
You have six hands and yet...

1178
01:47:10,366 --> 01:47:12,616
Not one is extended to help

1179
01:47:18,283 --> 01:47:20,866
We are in deep anguish

1180
01:47:21,033 --> 01:47:24,908
And you are nowhere to be seen

1181
01:47:29,158 --> 01:47:31,825
Why do you harbor anger

1182
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:34,366
Against the fragile

1183
01:47:40,033 --> 01:47:42,866
To hail you with raised arms

1184
01:47:42,950 --> 01:47:45,575
There is no strength left

1185
01:47:50,991 --> 01:47:56,283
Even with ceaseless worship,
We remain untouched by mercy

1186
01:47:56,408 --> 01:47:59,700
We called you again and again

1187
01:48:01,325 --> 01:48:04,033
Yet hope has faded away

1188
01:48:38,783 --> 01:48:42,991
Along with Rudra, Ranga and Bhaarava,
another ten Governors have teamed up.

1189
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:47,116
They will try to influence
the others to take their side.

1190
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:50,075
Rudra, whatever you say,
we won't go against our King.

1191
01:48:50,158 --> 01:48:51,158
Good.

1192
01:48:51,575 --> 01:48:55,033
When I become the king, I will
tell everyone around me

1193
01:48:55,158 --> 01:48:58,658
that there lived a very
loyal man like you.

1194
01:48:59,783 --> 01:49:00,783
But, my Lord...

1195
01:49:00,908 --> 01:49:02,950
You cannot win without the Ghaniyaars.

1196
01:49:03,033 --> 01:49:04,866
And no Ghaniyaar
will go against Naarang.

1197
01:49:05,033 --> 01:49:06,033
Naarang!

1198
01:49:06,075 --> 01:49:09,241
What if Ranga tries to influence
some of the Ghaniyaars?

1199
01:49:09,325 --> 01:49:11,616
If any one of us goes against our king,

1200
01:49:11,866 --> 01:49:14,241
I will kill him
with my own hands, my Lord.

1201
01:49:21,408 --> 01:49:23,991
- Do you have children?
- What?

1202
01:49:26,408 --> 01:49:27,700
Children.

1203
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:31,700
Boy.

1204
01:49:36,158 --> 01:49:37,158
Girl?

1205
01:49:41,408 --> 01:49:43,450
Girl...

1206
01:49:50,908 --> 01:49:51,908
Hey, Pandit!

1207
01:49:52,325 --> 01:49:53,783
He is wearing the bracelet.

1208
01:49:54,325 --> 01:49:55,325
Not now.

1209
01:49:56,241 --> 01:49:58,408
Just be patient for four more days.

1210
01:50:03,616 --> 01:50:04,908
Girl.

1211
01:50:11,658 --> 01:50:13,241
I also have a wish.

1212
01:50:13,366 --> 01:50:14,616
What is it, Naarang?

1213
01:50:14,991 --> 01:50:17,658
A wish to be a father
like our King Rajamannaar.

1214
01:50:21,825 --> 01:50:23,575
They are here again!

1215
01:50:23,658 --> 01:50:24,658
Mother...

1216
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:26,075
After the ceasefire voting

1217
01:50:26,450 --> 01:50:28,908
I wish to see my son in my chair.

1218
01:50:32,033 --> 01:50:36,616
As soon as the ceasefire voting gets
over, your son will become a Lord, Uncle.

1219
01:50:45,950 --> 01:50:48,866
Brother, Vishnu asked us
to go to Mahara.

1220
01:50:50,366 --> 01:50:51,491
This bloody...

1221
01:50:53,325 --> 01:50:54,366
- Hey!
- Sir?

1222
01:50:54,783 --> 01:50:57,741
Under no circumstances should
Deva know where we are going.

1223
01:51:00,450 --> 01:51:02,116
Even if he comes,
what can he do?

1224
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:03,908
Hey, tell him.

1225
01:51:04,033 --> 01:51:05,533
Deva shouldn't come there.

1226
01:51:06,408 --> 01:51:08,783
Hey, where is Devaratha?

1227
01:51:09,616 --> 01:51:11,616
Damn!
How can I make him understand?

1228
01:51:13,866 --> 01:51:15,366
Where is he?

1229
01:51:15,950 --> 01:51:17,408
It's useless to ask him.

1230
01:51:27,908 --> 01:51:29,866
Vishnu had a procedure there.

1231
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:32,491
First, he flies the kite high.

1232
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:43,200
Hey, stop right there.

1233
01:51:46,033 --> 01:51:47,908
Then he cuts the string himself.

1234
01:52:20,658 --> 01:52:21,908
Whichever house

1235
01:52:22,533 --> 01:52:24,741
the kite lands on...

1236
01:52:28,116 --> 01:52:31,908
He takes one girl from that house.

1237
01:52:32,866 --> 01:52:34,033
Oh, God! No!

1238
01:52:38,616 --> 01:52:39,616
Oh, no!

1239
01:52:43,783 --> 01:52:45,866
Oh, yeah... we got our chick.

1240
01:52:48,616 --> 01:52:50,033
No... I'll go.

1241
01:52:50,408 --> 01:52:52,616
You must take care
of our mother and Surabhi.

1242
01:52:53,491 --> 01:52:54,991
You are so young.

1243
01:52:55,116 --> 01:52:57,366
I am the elder one.
Listen to me.

1244
01:52:57,450 --> 01:52:58,866
This is on me.

1245
01:52:58,991 --> 01:53:00,866
No, no.
I will go.

1246
01:53:01,033 --> 01:53:02,533
Oh, no!

1247
01:53:02,783 --> 01:53:04,991
It doesn't matter if you go or she.

1248
01:53:05,075 --> 01:53:07,908
It doesn't matter who goes.
It's the same for me.

1249
01:53:07,991 --> 01:53:13,075
O Goddess!
Save us, please!

1250
01:53:15,658 --> 01:53:18,950
Oh, no!

1251
01:53:27,950 --> 01:53:28,950
Surabhi!

1252
01:53:30,241 --> 01:53:32,450
I don't know which girl is coming.

1253
01:53:33,825 --> 01:53:35,866
I cannot bear the suspense.

1254
01:53:39,741 --> 01:53:41,061
- Surabhi...
- What are you doing?

1255
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:44,533
- Surabhi... Surabhi...
- Don't go!

1256
01:54:28,616 --> 01:54:30,658
Hey, who called him here?

1257
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:33,158
Hey!

1258
01:54:33,366 --> 01:54:34,658
Follow the procedure.

1259
01:54:34,783 --> 01:54:36,450
Stand with your hands folded.

1260
01:54:51,408 --> 01:54:52,991
Good.

1261
01:54:58,950 --> 01:55:02,741
Sir! Please spare her!

1262
01:55:03,033 --> 01:55:04,616
Sir! Please spare her!

1263
01:55:04,741 --> 01:55:06,325
- Be quiet!
- Sir, sir...

1264
01:55:08,241 --> 01:55:09,116
Look at me!

1265
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:10,741
She is just a kid.

1266
01:55:16,908 --> 01:55:20,408
Where did you all go today,
leaving me behind?

1267
01:55:20,533 --> 01:55:22,658
That territory is called Mahara.

1268
01:55:23,825 --> 01:55:26,616
I beg you, my Lord.
Leave her.

1269
01:55:28,450 --> 01:55:29,908
It's like a poultry farm.

1270
01:55:31,741 --> 01:55:35,325
That scoundrel Vishnu
chooses a hen every day

1271
01:55:36,366 --> 01:55:37,366
and kills it.

1272
01:55:39,866 --> 01:55:42,200
Please spare her, sir!

1273
01:55:44,116 --> 01:55:45,408
Let's take her home.

1274
01:55:45,491 --> 01:55:46,825
Hey, I don't have the patience.

1275
01:55:47,783 --> 01:55:49,408
Leave her alone.

1276
01:55:49,533 --> 01:55:51,283
Give us two minutes, dear Lord.

1277
01:55:51,366 --> 01:55:53,241
I will get her ready like a lady.

1278
01:55:59,450 --> 01:56:01,908
- But, instead of the hens, it's...
- Baba.

1279
01:56:02,033 --> 01:56:04,700
We have other important things to do.
Let's go.

1280
01:56:20,950 --> 01:56:25,408
O Goddess Kaliyamma!

1281
01:57:12,950 --> 01:57:15,325
Your rituals are wrong.

1282
01:57:19,283 --> 01:57:21,950
If you want to please the Goddess...

1283
01:57:25,241 --> 01:57:27,283
go to the animal market first.

1284
01:57:31,908 --> 01:57:36,616
From the herd, select a nice and
healthy ram with strong twisted horns.

1285
01:57:40,033 --> 01:57:41,991
Hey, stop it!

1286
01:57:42,991 --> 01:57:43,991
Dear Lord!

1287
01:57:44,241 --> 01:57:46,908
Hold it by the horns and drag it down.

1288
01:57:47,783 --> 01:57:51,200
Garland it, apply turmeric
and vermilion on its face.

1289
01:57:51,366 --> 01:57:53,866
Then, sharpen the knife.

1290
01:57:53,991 --> 01:57:56,950
Hey, I am warning you!
I won't tell you again.

1291
01:57:57,408 --> 01:58:00,033
Sprinkle holy water on its face.

1292
01:58:01,033 --> 01:58:02,033
Mutthu!

1293
01:58:02,866 --> 01:58:06,616
As soon as it shakes its head...

1294
01:58:12,450 --> 01:58:14,075
Shall I complete the ritual now?

1295
01:59:09,366 --> 01:59:10,616
Hey, kill him!

1296
01:59:36,491 --> 01:59:37,491
Hey!

1297
02:00:14,741 --> 02:00:16,158
Look at what he is doing, Brother!

1298
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:17,700
Come on, fast!

1299
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:42,200
Go!

1300
02:00:58,450 --> 02:00:59,575
Surabhi!

1301
02:00:59,783 --> 02:01:01,366
Goddess Kaliyamma didn't come.

1302
02:01:02,075 --> 02:01:03,075
Instead...

1303
02:01:04,116 --> 02:01:05,616
she has sent her son for us.

1304
02:02:35,575 --> 02:02:38,200
Brother, he will kill Vishnu.

1305
02:02:39,783 --> 02:02:42,450
If he dies, you know
what our plight will be, right?

1306
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:46,366
Varadha!
Stop him right now!

1307
02:02:51,033 --> 02:02:53,866
I know him since childhood.

1308
02:02:55,700 --> 02:02:56,783
He won't stop.

1309
02:02:57,575 --> 02:03:00,033
Until he stops breathing...

1310
02:03:05,491 --> 02:03:06,491
He won't stop.

1311
02:03:25,658 --> 02:03:27,033
Are you going to kill me?

1312
02:03:27,158 --> 02:03:28,616
Do you know who my father is?

1313
02:03:32,408 --> 02:03:33,408
Baba!

1314
02:03:33,783 --> 02:03:35,158
Stop him, Baba.

1315
02:03:39,075 --> 02:03:40,241
I will kill you!

1316
02:03:41,700 --> 02:03:44,616
Kill that scoundrel!

1317
02:04:15,783 --> 02:04:17,325
Just two minutes...

1318
02:04:17,783 --> 02:04:19,866
I will get him ready like a Lord.

1319
02:04:47,866 --> 02:04:48,866
Hey!

1320
02:05:52,366 --> 02:05:55,991
I am just checking
if you are real or not, son.

1321
02:06:27,950 --> 02:06:29,241
Vishnu has been killed.

1322
02:06:36,741 --> 02:06:37,825
Was it him?

1323
02:06:48,366 --> 02:06:50,408
Why did Deva react so violently

1324
02:06:50,491 --> 02:06:52,700
for that poor girl he didn't even know?

1325
02:06:52,825 --> 02:06:54,741
I don't understand it even today.

1326
02:06:55,741 --> 02:06:56,825
I understand!

1327
02:06:58,366 --> 02:07:00,575
In every girl who is in distress,

1328
02:07:02,033 --> 02:07:03,491
he sees his mother.

1329
02:07:08,950 --> 02:07:10,491
How dare he touch the child!

1330
02:07:12,283 --> 02:07:13,575
That too a girl child!

1331
02:07:20,283 --> 02:07:21,616
Sorry.

1332
02:07:26,908 --> 02:07:28,325
What he did that day

1333
02:07:28,575 --> 02:07:29,825
affected not only me

1334
02:07:29,950 --> 02:07:31,450
but the entire Khansaar.

1335
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:34,616
This shouldn't be happening.

1336
02:07:34,741 --> 02:07:36,408
Especially during the ceasefire.

1337
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:39,616
This is going to impact
the upcoming voting.

1338
02:07:39,825 --> 02:07:42,741
Ceasefire was enforced to stop
Varadha from getting killed.

1339
02:07:42,825 --> 02:07:44,491
How could he go and do this?

1340
02:07:44,575 --> 02:07:46,200
Varadha didn't kill him.

1341
02:07:46,283 --> 02:07:47,616
The new guy did.

1342
02:07:51,325 --> 02:07:52,783
What do we do?

1343
02:07:52,866 --> 02:07:55,700
Now he is under the control
of the Mannar army.

1344
02:07:55,950 --> 02:07:59,825
But we cannot take
any decision about this right now.

1345
02:08:00,325 --> 02:08:03,366
The decision will be made
by Naarang at Velamgadi.

1346
02:08:03,658 --> 02:08:06,408
He will surely not spare Varadha.

1347
02:08:06,533 --> 02:08:09,908
Rudra!

1348
02:08:11,325 --> 02:08:15,075
I heard that Varadha would be
handed over to Naarang at Velamgadi.

1349
02:08:15,283 --> 02:08:19,325
Is he going to kill him?
But it's my prerogative to kill him.

1350
02:08:20,991 --> 02:08:23,325
Since it was the new guy
who flouted the rules,

1351
02:08:23,408 --> 02:08:27,825
you must convince Naarang
to punish the culprit.

1352
02:08:27,991 --> 02:08:31,408
If Varadha dies, I will be happy.

1353
02:08:31,616 --> 02:08:34,491
But I must follow my dad,
the King's command.

1354
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:37,408
Uncle, I will speak to Naarang.

1355
02:08:37,658 --> 02:08:39,200
Please go to Varadha.

1356
02:08:41,283 --> 02:08:42,741
Rudra...

1357
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:48,033
I haven't asked you
for anything since childhood.

1358
02:08:48,700 --> 02:08:53,075
Do something, please.

1359
02:08:53,825 --> 02:08:56,200
I want Varadha.

1360
02:08:59,783 --> 02:09:01,658
Tomorrow at Velamgadi...

1361
02:09:01,991 --> 02:09:04,908
Naarang is going to pronounce the verdict.

1362
02:09:05,158 --> 02:09:08,075
All arrangements have been made.

1363
02:09:08,283 --> 02:09:09,283
What does it mean?

1364
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:12,116
If you want to come out,

1365
02:09:12,408 --> 02:09:14,658
don't open your mouth there.

1366
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:17,366
What does it mean?

1367
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:35,116
I know this is not
the right time to say this.

1368
02:09:35,533 --> 02:09:39,741
You have all the rights to do whatever
you want with the one who killed your son.

1369
02:09:39,908 --> 02:09:41,616
Varadha didn't kill your son.

1370
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:45,116
The one who killed him is the new guy.

1371
02:09:45,241 --> 02:09:46,783
Remember that!

1372
02:09:47,825 --> 02:09:49,783
My Lord...

1373
02:09:59,908 --> 02:10:05,616
If the ceasefire has to be lifted,

1374
02:10:08,116 --> 02:10:10,283
Varadha must be killed.

1375
02:10:20,116 --> 02:10:23,741
It's true that Varadha
didn't kill your son.

1376
02:10:23,991 --> 02:10:24,991
But...

1377
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:29,033
when your son Vishnu
was mercilessly murdered

1378
02:10:30,450 --> 02:10:32,991
he stood there without doing anything.

1379
02:10:55,741 --> 02:10:58,075
The verdict at Velamgadi today

1380
02:10:58,241 --> 02:10:59,950
has nothing to do with Kotagada.

1381
02:11:00,033 --> 02:11:02,616
Whatever happens there, no one
should lift a finger.

1382
02:11:02,741 --> 02:11:05,158
All of you remove cartridges
from guns.

1383
02:11:05,241 --> 02:11:08,075
Until I say, nobody should use weapons.

1384
02:11:08,908 --> 02:11:11,783
Somebody's head will roll today.

1385
02:11:12,075 --> 02:11:14,158
As soon as it happens,
inform me.

1386
02:11:17,116 --> 02:11:19,116
I will take care of everything there.

1387
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:21,325
You just need to remain silent.

1388
02:11:22,991 --> 02:11:24,033
Understand?

1389
02:12:00,741 --> 02:12:02,991
Isn't he the one who killed Vishnu?

1390
02:12:04,908 --> 02:12:06,741
I heard he killed as many as 25.

1391
02:12:35,533 --> 02:12:38,991
Will he chop his head
or Varadha's head today?

1392
02:13:11,325 --> 02:13:13,408
He is drawing sword!

1393
02:13:39,491 --> 02:13:41,741
He is going towards Varadha, bro!

1394
02:13:49,325 --> 02:13:50,325
Hey!

1395
02:13:50,741 --> 02:13:53,533
He is going to kill your rooster.

1396
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:02,700
Deva...

1397
02:14:03,616 --> 02:14:04,658
Deva!

1398
02:14:05,408 --> 02:14:06,950
It was me who killed your son.

1399
02:14:07,033 --> 02:14:09,491
Do whatever you want with me.
Don't touch Varadha.

1400
02:14:11,116 --> 02:14:12,991
- Varadha is innocent.
- Deva, wait.

1401
02:14:13,241 --> 02:14:14,325
You can punish me.

1402
02:14:14,700 --> 02:14:15,991
Give me any punishment.

1403
02:14:22,491 --> 02:14:23,491
I...

1404
02:14:23,825 --> 02:14:25,366
I am begging you.

1405
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:28,283
Please spare Varadha.

1406
02:14:31,116 --> 02:14:32,116
Deva!

1407
02:14:33,491 --> 02:14:34,783
Deva! Listen to me.

1408
02:14:35,158 --> 02:14:36,408
Stop right there.

1409
02:14:40,158 --> 02:14:41,158
I am the one

1410
02:14:41,991 --> 02:14:43,908
who killed your son Vishnu.

1411
02:14:46,408 --> 02:14:47,408
Hey...

1412
02:14:47,783 --> 02:14:48,825
Kill me.

1413
02:14:49,116 --> 02:14:50,491
But...

1414
02:14:50,741 --> 02:14:53,116
Please don't touch Varadha.

1415
02:15:10,241 --> 02:15:11,908
Hey, bring him aside.

1416
02:15:14,116 --> 02:15:15,741
Hey, move aside.

1417
02:15:21,908 --> 02:15:22,908
Sir...

1418
02:15:23,033 --> 02:15:24,283
He didn't do anything.

1419
02:15:24,408 --> 02:15:25,741
It was for me.

1420
02:15:28,075 --> 02:15:29,075
Kill me, sir.

1421
02:16:13,991 --> 02:16:15,111
I told you to spare Varadha!

1422
02:16:16,616 --> 02:16:18,366
Didn't I tell you not to touch my Varadha?

1423
02:16:20,116 --> 02:16:21,366
What are you looking at?

1424
02:16:21,575 --> 02:16:22,741
Finish then off!

1425
02:16:22,825 --> 02:16:24,200
Load your guns!

1426
02:16:25,325 --> 02:16:26,783
No one should touch him.

1427
02:16:29,533 --> 02:16:30,533
Please!

1428
02:16:34,241 --> 02:16:35,325
I...

1429
02:16:36,450 --> 02:16:37,658
kindly...

1430
02:16:40,033 --> 02:16:41,075
...request!

1431
02:17:14,700 --> 02:17:15,991
Is it Varadha's head?

1432
02:17:17,908 --> 02:17:19,075
Or the new guy's?

1433
02:17:19,283 --> 02:17:21,616
The new guy decapitated Naarang, Rudra.

1434
02:17:37,825 --> 02:17:39,991
You muted me in Khansaar.

1435
02:17:41,158 --> 02:17:45,200
But he decapitated
two people at high volume.

1436
02:17:45,616 --> 02:17:47,450
Maybe he doesn't know the rules...

1437
02:17:47,825 --> 02:17:50,200
What if he knows them
but didn't follow them?

1438
02:17:59,325 --> 02:18:00,491
Of course!

1439
02:18:01,575 --> 02:18:03,616
Varadha said it correctly...

1440
02:18:03,741 --> 02:18:05,950
Seriously, he got himself a maniac.

1441
02:18:10,283 --> 02:18:13,491
Before Devaratha came
here, we were on a frying pan,

1442
02:18:14,533 --> 02:18:16,325
getting our lives fried
and burnt.

1443
02:18:18,325 --> 02:18:19,533
He killed his son

1444
02:18:21,033 --> 02:18:22,658
and threw us into the fire.

1445
02:18:23,075 --> 02:18:25,366
I wish they spare at least our bones.

1446
02:18:26,158 --> 02:18:27,158
But no.

1447
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:30,325
He has killed his son.

1448
02:18:31,908 --> 02:18:35,325
Ask me where he is going to
send us from this fire.

1449
02:18:36,491 --> 02:18:37,491
That's a suspense.

1450
02:18:38,533 --> 02:18:39,533
What?

1451
02:18:43,950 --> 02:18:46,658
Brother... brother... brother...

1452
02:18:47,491 --> 02:18:50,158
You gave him a pet name when he was young.

1453
02:18:50,241 --> 02:18:51,575
What was that?

1454
02:18:51,658 --> 02:18:53,991
I forgot! I forgot! I forgot!

1455
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:55,450
Can you remind me?

1456
02:18:55,616 --> 02:18:59,533
You gave him a name with a lot of pride!

1457
02:18:59,700 --> 02:19:01,325
What was it?
Tell me.

1458
02:19:01,616 --> 02:19:03,408
Tell me, brother.
Tell me, tell me...

1459
02:19:03,491 --> 02:19:04,491
Tell me!

1460
02:19:08,950 --> 02:19:09,950
Hey!

1461
02:19:10,450 --> 02:19:12,616
Hey, brother! Hey, brother!
Tell me!

1462
02:19:12,908 --> 02:19:14,616
- Hey...
- Hey, sit down!

1463
02:19:20,991 --> 02:19:22,575
I warned him not to touch you.

1464
02:19:23,575 --> 02:19:24,575
Didn't I?

1465
02:19:25,616 --> 02:19:26,950
You heard me, right?

1466
02:19:29,158 --> 02:19:30,700
How could he touch you!

1467
02:19:32,533 --> 02:19:34,033
No one should touch you!

1468
02:19:48,533 --> 02:19:49,741
Sorry.

1469
02:19:55,241 --> 02:19:57,075
I should be saying sorry.

1470
02:19:58,158 --> 02:19:59,450
It was all my fault.

1471
02:20:04,450 --> 02:20:06,075
No matter what happened here,

1472
02:20:06,158 --> 02:20:07,533
many times I stopped myself

1473
02:20:07,658 --> 02:20:09,783
from getting you involved in all these.

1474
02:20:11,825 --> 02:20:13,116
But I couldn't anymore.

1475
02:20:13,908 --> 02:20:18,075
I knew this is how it would end
once you come here.

1476
02:20:19,908 --> 02:20:22,950
You would have done great
anywhere but here.

1477
02:20:23,533 --> 02:20:24,783
Despite knowing that...

1478
02:20:26,908 --> 02:20:27,950
Sorry.

1479
02:20:50,658 --> 02:20:53,491
What could be more important
to dad than this?

1480
02:20:54,158 --> 02:20:57,450
He doesn't answer my calls at all.

1481
02:20:58,200 --> 02:21:00,825
Uncle, did you hear anything
about him?

1482
02:21:02,408 --> 02:21:05,075
If he doesn't turn up,
we will lose for sure.

1483
02:21:05,366 --> 02:21:07,241
There are 101 votes in total.

1484
02:21:07,491 --> 02:21:09,325
Since Naarang and Vishnu are dead,

1485
02:21:09,450 --> 02:21:12,033
they will invalidate their four votes.

1486
02:21:12,283 --> 02:21:13,783
97 votes remain.

1487
02:21:13,866 --> 02:21:18,158
With nine votes of Bhaarava,
Ranga and you, our votes would be 24.

1488
02:21:18,575 --> 02:21:21,950
We cannot trust the remaining voters.

1489
02:21:22,033 --> 02:21:24,825
Zorani, Acharya, Mishra,
Akram Pasha, Shukla...

1490
02:21:24,908 --> 02:21:26,408
I will bring all of them here.

1491
02:21:26,491 --> 02:21:28,950
You must hand over Varadha
to me after voting.

1492
02:21:29,825 --> 02:21:31,575
What are you going to do with him?

1493
02:21:37,366 --> 02:21:41,033
What is our vote count
including all of them?

1494
02:21:42,033 --> 02:21:43,700
Including the King...

1495
02:21:43,783 --> 02:21:44,783
Forty eight.

1496
02:21:44,950 --> 02:21:46,700
Forty eight.

1497
02:21:53,408 --> 02:21:56,366
I will show you
what I am going to do with Varadha.

1498
02:21:56,450 --> 02:21:58,491
I will give drugs to all prisoners

1499
02:21:58,575 --> 02:22:00,158
and turn them into beasts.

1500
02:22:00,241 --> 02:22:02,408
Upon seeing red,
they would become violent.

1501
02:22:02,491 --> 02:22:04,408
Do you know what they would do then?

1502
02:22:04,491 --> 02:22:05,991
Hey, get up!

1503
02:22:15,783 --> 02:22:19,033
I will send a hundred such men
to Varadha.

1504
02:22:29,116 --> 02:22:31,366
Let's assume that the King would be back.

1505
02:22:31,491 --> 02:22:35,200
We need Varadha's vote also.

1506
02:22:41,116 --> 02:22:44,700
Right from childhood I know
that you are my father's blood.

1507
02:22:44,783 --> 02:22:47,033
I have despised you ever since.

1508
02:22:47,116 --> 02:22:49,908
If these bars were not here,

1509
02:22:49,991 --> 02:22:52,241
you would have known
how deeply I hate you.

1510
02:22:52,450 --> 02:22:55,283
King Rajamannaar won't turn up
for the voting tomorrow.

1511
02:22:55,533 --> 02:22:58,158
Everything will go as I expected.

1512
02:22:58,283 --> 02:23:01,200
Take this as an advice or a warning.

1513
02:23:01,658 --> 02:23:03,991
If you vote to lift the ceasefire

1514
02:23:04,075 --> 02:23:05,616
I will kill you!

1515
02:23:06,366 --> 02:23:11,116
A man goes to any extent
to achieve something he loves.

1516
02:23:11,366 --> 02:23:15,616
But to destroy something he hates...
he goes even beyond that.

1517
02:23:15,991 --> 02:23:20,366
I hated you even before
my younger brother did.

1518
02:23:29,158 --> 02:23:32,616
King Rajamannaar is coming
to Kotagada tomorrow.

1519
02:23:33,533 --> 02:23:38,158
If you vote for lifting the ceasefire
and disrespect him,

1520
02:23:38,241 --> 02:23:44,158
I will definitely divert all my hatred
towards the one you love the most.

1521
02:23:44,241 --> 02:23:45,325
Badri!

1522
02:23:45,700 --> 02:23:46,741
Madam!

1523
02:23:46,908 --> 02:23:49,366
If things don't go as I say tomorrow,

1524
02:23:49,450 --> 02:23:54,741
drag his brother out and behead him
once the voting is over.

1525
02:24:02,325 --> 02:24:05,366
If it's my father's blood that
runs through your veins,

1526
02:24:06,033 --> 02:24:07,866
you will make the right decision.

1527
02:24:25,658 --> 02:24:28,283
Bhaarava, I am very scared.

1528
02:24:28,950 --> 02:24:30,870
Do you think today's voting
will go as we expect?

1529
02:24:32,991 --> 02:24:34,116
It has to.

1530
02:24:34,366 --> 02:24:36,200
And it will!

1531
02:24:36,825 --> 02:24:39,450
Finally, it's our time.

1532
02:24:55,825 --> 02:24:59,116
Hear... hear... hear!

1533
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:03,325
The voting process regarding
the ceasefire declared nine days ago

1534
02:25:03,450 --> 02:25:06,241
is about to begin at Kotagada today.

1535
02:25:06,366 --> 02:25:11,241
To make a decision on this, first
the Governors, followed by the Lords,

1536
02:25:11,325 --> 02:25:15,241
and finally the King
shall use their voting right.

1537
02:25:15,450 --> 02:25:17,741
Those who want the ceasefire to end

1538
02:25:17,866 --> 02:25:20,866
shall place their bracelets
on the left plate of the scale.

1539
02:25:21,116 --> 02:25:23,241
Those who want the ceasefire to continue

1540
02:25:23,408 --> 02:25:26,866
shall place their bracelets on
the right plate of the scale.

1541
02:25:28,700 --> 02:25:30,741
As Varadha Rajamannaar is
an offender,

1542
02:25:30,825 --> 02:25:36,450
he can use his right to vote
only if there is a tie.

1543
02:25:40,325 --> 02:25:41,991
The voting shall begin now.

1544
02:25:42,116 --> 02:25:46,200
The voting should end before
the given time.

1545
02:25:46,408 --> 02:25:48,408
Governor number 1!

1546
02:25:51,741 --> 02:25:53,283
Governor number 10.

1547
02:25:53,575 --> 02:25:55,575
Governor number 41.

1548
02:25:56,033 --> 02:25:58,450
Governor number 6!

1549
02:25:58,575 --> 02:26:01,783
Governor number 26.37.

1550
02:26:01,908 --> 02:26:03,783
Governor number 32.

1551
02:26:03,866 --> 02:26:05,116
Four!

1552
02:26:05,241 --> 02:26:07,741
Governor number 14!
5!

1553
02:26:07,866 --> 02:26:10,325
Governor number 2! 60!

1554
02:26:10,450 --> 02:26:12,450
Governor number 50! 3!

1555
02:26:12,575 --> 02:26:14,241
Governor 22!

1556
02:26:19,700 --> 02:26:21,908
I checked flight arrivals to Khansaar.

1557
02:26:21,991 --> 02:26:24,533
There is no information
about the King's arrival.

1558
02:26:25,741 --> 02:26:28,241
Now the Lords will cast their votes.

1559
02:26:43,658 --> 02:26:45,866
Only the King's fifteen votes are left.

1560
02:26:45,991 --> 02:26:49,033
If he doesn't turn up
before the time runs out,

1561
02:26:49,158 --> 02:26:51,866
the bracelets already used
for voting will be counted

1562
02:26:51,950 --> 02:26:55,325
and the verdict on
ceasefire will be announced.

1563
02:27:15,366 --> 02:27:17,616
Shivmannaar's son!

1564
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:30,200
Khansaar's King, Rajamannaar
returns to his court!

1565
02:27:51,825 --> 02:27:55,408
Since it's a tie
with 48 votes on each side,

1566
02:27:55,616 --> 02:27:59,283
the verdict shall be based
on Varadha Rajamannaar's vote.

1567
02:28:00,991 --> 02:28:03,991
Make your disgrace complete now.

1568
02:28:15,366 --> 02:28:18,450
We don't know in whose favor
the voting will end.

1569
02:28:19,491 --> 02:28:22,991
But we can decide for which side
you are going to vote.

1570
02:28:28,616 --> 02:28:30,866
It doesn't matter what they think.

1571
02:28:31,616 --> 02:28:34,908
What decision are you
going to make?

1572
02:28:35,908 --> 02:28:36,991
Tell me.

1573
02:28:39,491 --> 02:28:42,616
For a hunter, the greatest pain
is not missing a prey,

1574
02:28:44,950 --> 02:28:48,825
but being not allowed to hunt.

1575
02:28:52,533 --> 02:28:54,241
Is allowing enough?

1576
02:28:59,450 --> 02:29:00,616
It's enough.

1577
02:29:03,533 --> 02:29:05,908
In that case,
declare the hunting season open!

1578
02:29:06,783 --> 02:29:10,283
I was waiting for you say it.

1579
02:29:11,241 --> 02:29:13,325
Khansaar must burn red!

1580
02:29:16,991 --> 02:29:18,908
Either with burning embers

1581
02:29:20,366 --> 02:29:23,991
or with their blood.

1582
02:29:25,866 --> 02:29:28,783
More than the redness of raging fire,

1583
02:29:29,700 --> 02:29:33,200
the crimson color of flowing blood
is always beautiful.

1584
02:30:01,783 --> 02:30:02,783
Thank you.

1585
02:30:03,825 --> 02:30:05,283
With your advice,

1586
02:30:06,116 --> 02:30:08,158
I have taken the right decision.

1587
02:30:09,116 --> 02:30:11,450
I too have...

1588
02:30:14,075 --> 02:30:16,408
the Mannaar blood
flowing through my veins.

1589
02:30:20,116 --> 02:30:23,200
Today, from 12:01 at night onwards,

1590
02:30:23,325 --> 02:30:28,075
based on the result of the votes,
the ceasefire has been lifted!

1591
02:30:39,741 --> 02:30:41,491
Now the rooster is yours.

1592
02:30:51,408 --> 02:30:52,991
They lifted the ceasefire?

1593
02:30:54,783 --> 02:30:56,408
Against them?

1594
02:30:57,700 --> 02:30:58,700
I mean how?

1595
02:31:00,158 --> 02:31:05,450
But the most important problem
was how to survive the night.

1596
02:31:15,950 --> 02:31:19,533
Oh, are you saying that your people
are in trouble because of us?

1597
02:31:21,908 --> 02:31:23,366
Varadha voted in their favor.

1598
02:31:23,450 --> 02:31:25,075
All must be chopped to pieces.

1599
02:31:25,158 --> 02:31:26,200
Get everyone out.

1600
02:31:47,616 --> 02:31:49,700
Finish off his younger brother first.

1601
02:31:53,366 --> 02:31:54,991
Sharpen the knife.

1602
02:31:59,116 --> 02:32:00,116
Come.

1603
02:32:09,450 --> 02:32:12,658
Do you like to watch tigers hunting?
I do not like it at all.

1604
02:32:12,866 --> 02:32:15,200
It's very boring.
I don't like it.

1605
02:32:15,283 --> 02:32:19,783
More than tigers, I like to watch
how wild dogs hunt.

1606
02:32:20,325 --> 02:32:21,783
It skins its prey
and eats the flesh

1607
02:32:21,866 --> 02:32:23,325
while it is still alive.

1608
02:32:26,783 --> 02:32:29,491
I wanted to kill you myself.

1609
02:32:29,575 --> 02:32:31,700
But I have no capacity for such violence.

1610
02:32:31,866 --> 02:32:34,658
That's why I have raised
some wild dogs.

1611
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:39,200
I gave them all kinds of drugs
and made them rabid.

1612
02:32:39,366 --> 02:32:44,950
When they tear up your body,
and scatter the pieces.

1613
02:32:45,033 --> 02:32:47,158
I would relish that sight!

1614
02:32:54,116 --> 02:32:56,241
Now, we have a hope to live.

1615
02:32:58,658 --> 02:32:59,783
After a long time...

1616
02:33:00,491 --> 02:33:02,283
we have started worshiping again.

1617
02:33:21,116 --> 02:33:22,116
Don't be scared.

1618
02:33:24,825 --> 02:33:26,241
Nothing will happen to them.

1619
02:33:52,741 --> 02:33:53,783
Hey.

1620
02:33:56,033 --> 02:33:58,741
You won't even cut the skin
if you whet it like that.

1621
02:34:00,325 --> 02:34:02,575
Slant it and whet.

1622
02:34:07,283 --> 02:34:08,950
It must cut through his bones!

1623
02:34:17,991 --> 02:34:20,491
You want me to give you a tattoo now?

1624
02:34:21,991 --> 02:34:25,116
Can't you see death waiting

1625
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:29,075
all around for you, sir?

1626
02:34:31,491 --> 02:34:33,533
Do you see it too?

1627
02:34:52,075 --> 02:34:54,450
What do you want me to tattoo?

1628
02:35:00,908 --> 02:35:03,158
Whatever you see in my eyes.

1629
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:53,491
It's done, sir.

1630
02:36:41,366 --> 02:36:43,491
Where are they all going?

1631
02:36:44,241 --> 02:36:46,533
They must have found
something redder, sir.

1632
02:36:56,241 --> 02:37:00,241
Have you ever seen
the one who hunts the hunters?

1633
02:37:03,033 --> 02:37:04,033
You can see him now.

1634
02:37:07,575 --> 02:37:09,991
Your grim reaper is here.

1635
02:37:11,783 --> 02:37:15,908
You gave them drugs and made them mad.

1636
02:37:28,825 --> 02:37:31,908
But he was born mad.

1637
02:37:46,116 --> 02:37:48,033
Release the remaining dogs!

1638
02:37:52,116 --> 02:37:53,825
Why are you so late?

1639
02:37:55,116 --> 02:37:56,741
The tattoo took some time.

1640
02:38:00,075 --> 02:38:01,700
You are tired with so few men?

1641
02:38:01,783 --> 02:38:03,950
Hey, if I had a sword

1642
02:38:04,033 --> 02:38:06,366
I too would have performed
just like you did.

1643
02:38:09,408 --> 02:38:10,908
Here, take the bigger one.

1644
02:38:31,616 --> 02:38:34,158
Why didn't you come
back here for 25 years?

1645
02:38:37,575 --> 02:38:42,366
Why didn't you call me
back here for 25 years?

1646
02:38:45,825 --> 02:38:46,825
I should have.

1647
02:39:05,116 --> 02:39:06,116
What happened?

1648
02:39:06,575 --> 02:39:07,825
Don't you know how to whistle?

1649
02:39:14,575 --> 02:39:17,033
Do you have admirers there?

1650
02:39:17,908 --> 02:39:18,908
Of course.

1651
02:39:19,825 --> 02:39:20,991
More than you.

1652
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:26,241
But they are girlfriends.

1653
02:39:27,575 --> 02:39:29,033
I have some too.

1654
02:40:17,075 --> 02:40:19,700
But I got more applause than you.

1655
02:40:40,575 --> 02:40:44,616
The problems started when you
wanted to make Varadha a Lord.

1656
02:40:45,825 --> 02:40:47,575
We are all violent men.

1657
02:41:00,700 --> 02:41:02,950
Violence is in our blood.

1658
02:41:14,658 --> 02:41:15,741
I have been suppressing

1659
02:41:15,825 --> 02:41:17,408
that 1000-years-old violent nature

1660
02:41:17,491 --> 02:41:18,533
for the past 25 years.

1661
02:41:18,866 --> 02:41:20,950
I have a childhood story.

1662
02:41:22,241 --> 02:41:24,741
This was bound to happen some day.

1663
02:41:24,825 --> 02:41:28,408
The ceasefire was only an excuse
to fight amongst themselves.

1664
02:41:28,866 --> 02:41:32,741
I would stand on the terrace
every day looking at the entire Khansaar

1665
02:41:33,283 --> 02:41:36,825
and dream that one day
all this would be mine.

1666
02:41:37,991 --> 02:41:42,575
Enough fighting for bracelets
and breadcrumbs.

1667
02:41:44,741 --> 02:41:47,491
I want all that is

1668
02:41:49,075 --> 02:41:50,533
in front of my eyes.

1669
02:41:51,325 --> 02:41:55,825
Everyone is after my throne.

1670
02:42:10,950 --> 02:42:13,575
That is exactly why
they are joining hands.

1671
02:42:14,033 --> 02:42:15,825
The first to join hands

1672
02:42:16,033 --> 02:42:17,575
were our own people.

1673
02:42:34,616 --> 02:42:37,616
Did you think I would kill you, Uncle?

1674
02:42:38,075 --> 02:42:41,450
How can I kill my own blood?

1675
02:42:42,158 --> 02:42:44,866
If you and I stand together

1676
02:42:45,075 --> 02:42:51,325
we can bring every territory in Khansaar
under Mannaar rule.

1677
02:42:52,075 --> 02:42:53,825
What do you say, Uncle?

1678
02:42:58,158 --> 02:42:59,325
What makes you think

1679
02:42:59,408 --> 02:43:02,033
that uncle and Rudra have joined
hands against you?

1680
02:43:03,116 --> 02:43:05,616
Why do you think Rudra invited Pandit?

1681
02:43:06,575 --> 02:43:09,158
I know exactly what Pandit is capable of.

1682
02:43:09,950 --> 02:43:11,450
Secondly...

1683
02:43:11,950 --> 02:43:16,908
I went out of Khansaar because I
came to know about a huge weapons deal.

1684
02:43:16,991 --> 02:43:19,783
The order was placed from Khansaar.

1685
02:43:20,408 --> 02:43:21,408
Who?

1686
02:43:25,658 --> 02:43:26,700
Vaali.

1687
02:43:27,825 --> 02:43:30,575
Do you know why Rajamannaar
obliterated an entire tribe

1688
02:43:30,741 --> 02:43:33,283
but spared us, the Ghaniyaars?

1689
02:43:34,616 --> 02:43:36,366
Because we have no unity.

1690
02:43:38,366 --> 02:43:41,283
What happened to them should
never happen to us.

1691
02:43:47,908 --> 02:43:50,491
Khansaar is breaking
into pieces now.

1692
02:43:51,783 --> 02:43:53,658
If we stand united,

1693
02:43:55,575 --> 02:43:58,325
the whole of Khansaar will be ours.

1694
02:44:06,616 --> 02:44:07,616
Thiru...

1695
02:44:09,075 --> 02:44:10,325
Thirdly...

1696
02:44:11,991 --> 02:44:14,241
More terrible than these two.

1697
02:44:14,741 --> 02:44:18,908
The sin I committed 25 years ago
has come back to hunt me down.

1698
02:44:19,533 --> 02:44:20,533
Tell me.

1699
02:44:21,533 --> 02:44:22,533
Where are they?

1700
02:44:25,033 --> 02:44:26,533
Where is Bhaarava?

1701
02:44:27,908 --> 02:44:29,116
Bhaarava?

1702
02:44:31,575 --> 02:44:34,991
Your husband does not belong
to Mannaar tribe as you believe.

1703
02:44:35,616 --> 02:44:36,616
Then?

1704
02:44:39,533 --> 02:44:42,825
Do you know why I built
such huge walls around Khansaar?

1705
02:44:42,991 --> 02:44:46,991
Do you know why I hold the most powerful
weapons and maintain the biggest army?

1706
02:44:48,283 --> 02:44:52,116
Because I always have this fear
that at least one of them is still alive.

1707
02:44:52,575 --> 02:44:53,575
Who?

1708
02:44:58,533 --> 02:44:59,741
The Shouryaangas.

1709
02:45:09,866 --> 02:45:11,866
Bhaarava is a Shouryaanga?

1710
02:45:28,116 --> 02:45:30,658
Do you know how did we hid

1711
02:45:30,783 --> 02:45:33,450
our elderly, women
and children that day?

1712
02:45:53,366 --> 02:45:56,533
Wait, wait...

1713
02:45:57,241 --> 02:45:58,241
What?

1714
02:45:59,616 --> 02:46:01,075
Shouryaanga army was waiting

1715
02:46:01,158 --> 02:46:02,616
for the past 25 years,

1716
02:46:02,700 --> 02:46:04,908
all the while, causing internal conflicts

1717
02:46:04,991 --> 02:46:06,408
in Khansaar to weaken it.

1718
02:46:09,825 --> 02:46:12,783
We still feel the pain.

1719
02:46:16,741 --> 02:46:21,700
We have been living in hiding.

1720
02:46:21,908 --> 02:46:24,033
We have changed our names.

1721
02:46:24,283 --> 02:46:27,366
We have changed our identity.

1722
02:46:27,783 --> 02:46:30,075
All for this day.

1723
02:46:32,075 --> 02:46:33,533
When will you forgive him?

1724
02:46:33,616 --> 02:46:35,491
- Who?
- Your son.

1725
02:46:35,658 --> 02:46:38,408
If you don't eliminate
your enemies by tonight

1726
02:46:38,491 --> 02:46:39,491
The Constitution.

1727
02:46:39,575 --> 02:46:43,408
Naarang must defy Rajamannaar.
He must kill Varadha.

1728
02:46:46,116 --> 02:46:51,283
You beheaded our deity!

1729
02:46:55,366 --> 02:46:59,408
To burn you alive
along with your throne...

1730
02:46:59,533 --> 02:47:03,783
each one of the Shouryaangas
are eagerly waiting here.

1731
02:47:10,741 --> 02:47:12,825
Except one.

1732
02:47:19,950 --> 02:47:20,950
You...

1733
02:47:22,491 --> 02:47:25,158
remember Dhaara?

1734
02:47:31,575 --> 02:47:33,408
Our leader.

1735
02:47:35,991 --> 02:47:37,658
But you killed him.

1736
02:47:40,408 --> 02:47:41,533
But...

1737
02:47:43,991 --> 02:47:47,533
His son is still alive!

1738
02:47:51,366 --> 02:47:56,450
That night, your son Varadha rescued
Dhaara's son

1739
02:47:56,616 --> 02:47:58,158
and sent him out of Khansaar.

1740
02:47:58,241 --> 02:48:00,241
Leave immediately from here.

1741
02:48:00,450 --> 02:48:03,075
Did you just threw away your bracelet?

1742
02:48:03,241 --> 02:48:04,783
Why did you do that?

1743
02:48:06,158 --> 02:48:11,200
We have been looking
for him all these years.

1744
02:48:12,991 --> 02:48:15,950
But he has returned by himself.

1745
02:48:17,450 --> 02:48:19,330
Varadha has got
his army registered at the gate.

1746
02:48:21,366 --> 02:48:28,241
You all saw what he did
right after he set foot in Khansaar.

1747
02:48:30,033 --> 02:48:31,533
Vishnu was killed.

1748
02:48:31,783 --> 02:48:32,783
Was it him?

1749
02:48:35,741 --> 02:48:38,033
Our leader!

1750
02:48:55,991 --> 02:48:58,200
I will get our army ready, Father.

1751
02:48:59,658 --> 02:49:00,658
He is a...

1752
02:49:00,991 --> 02:49:01,991
Shouryaanga?

1753
02:49:02,116 --> 02:49:04,075
Wait, wait... wait...

1754
02:49:05,366 --> 02:49:07,616
I need a drink.
Do you have?

1755
02:49:14,450 --> 02:49:16,866
Inform our Mannaar army
to stay on high alert

1756
02:49:16,950 --> 02:49:19,741
not just at the Khansaar gates,
but throughout the city!

1757
02:49:25,033 --> 02:49:26,033
Whoa!

1758
02:49:34,950 --> 02:49:39,533
On one hand, all of Khansaar
is ready to go to war for the throne.

1759
02:49:47,450 --> 02:49:50,200
On the other,
thousands of Shouryaangas are ready

1760
02:49:50,283 --> 02:49:52,075
to burn the chair down.

1761
02:49:54,825 --> 02:49:58,575
But Deva had promised
the same throne to Varadha.

1762
02:50:03,533 --> 02:50:04,658
But...

1763
02:50:05,241 --> 02:50:08,866
The right to sit on that throne
belongs to...

1764
02:50:20,408 --> 02:50:21,491
Deva.

1765
02:50:32,033 --> 02:50:33,241
Does Deva know about this?

1766
02:50:43,408 --> 02:50:44,408
What if he finds out?

1767
02:50:50,241 --> 02:50:53,200
No one should survive.

1768
02:51:06,575 --> 02:51:10,158
You asked me about the name
I gave him as a child...

1769
02:51:20,075 --> 02:51:21,950
Salaar.
