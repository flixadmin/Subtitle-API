All right. Well, there's gotta be
some kind of workaround, right?

165
00:09:29,915 --> 00:09:33,017
It's a technical problem.
You guys are technical guys.

166

You know, be creative.
Put your heads together.

167

168

169

you keep an open mind.

174
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:12,354
All I can say
to recommend this one

175
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:14,657
is we're talking about
an owner here who is--

176
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:17,459
how should I put it--
highly amenable.

177

Okay. I get it. Just say no,

All right.
So I'll start.

179

No way we're cooking in here.

180
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:32,072
No space,
nowhere for the smell to go.

181

a quarter of a mile away.

185
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:42,082
The hammer comes down,

186
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:44,319
it's gonna be

00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:49,423

188

189
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:53,360

<i>[Walt] The house is infested.</i>

192
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:15,981
Termites,
cockroaches, whatever.

193
00:11:16,016 --> 00:11:19,719
Homeowners hire
a pest control company.

194
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:22,587
Truck rolls up,
homeowners leave.

195
00:11:22,622 --> 00:11:24,756
The crew tents the house.

196
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,392
They bomb the place
with poison.

197
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:29,795
The house stays like that
for days.

198
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:31,963
No one looks twice
at a tented house.

199
00:11:31,997 --> 00:11:34,599
Now, maybe there's a strange
smell coming out of it.

200
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:36,434
Does someone think
to investigate? No.

201
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:39,937
Anyone go inside?
Hell, no.

202
00:11:43,074 --> 00:11:45,275
And that's where we'll cook.

203

They tent, what,
three, four houses a week?

204
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:53,282
So we pick the one
that's best for us--

205
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:55,585
enough floor space,
easy access.

206
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:57,253
Once the tent is up,

207
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:59,188
we go in, we cook a batch,

208
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:02,691
we bomb the place, and leave.

209
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:05,962
So we gotta move
in and out for every cook?

210
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:09,899
Set up the lab, cook,
and then take everything down?

211
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:13,035
It's challenging but doable.

The pest control operation

I mean, they're licensed,

Yeah. I mean, hey,

They don't boost anything
while they're on the job.

226
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:47,568
They copy the keys, locate
the valuables and alarms,

227
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:50,003
and they sell that information
to other crews.

Or, after a decent interval,

that-- that chicken man.

481
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:21,581
As far as I'm concerned,
too little too late.

482
00:29:21,615 --> 00:29:24,017
If it were me,
I'd tell them all to go to hell.

483

Do I sound bitter?

484
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:28,754
But it's--
it's what he wants, right?

485
00:29:28,788 --> 00:29:30,722
Yeah, it's doing him good.

486
00:29:30,757 --> 00:29:34,293
I mean, his PT
is going gangbusters.

487
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:36,228
He's hardly using
his cane at all.

488
00:29:36,263 --> 00:29:39,398
And thank you for that, really.

489
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:41,867
I mean, God knows where he'd be

490
00:29:41,901 --> 00:29:44,770
if we had to go through
his health plan.

491
00:29:44,804 --> 00:29:46,772
I'm just glad
he's feeling better.

492
00:29:46,806 --> 00:29:48,774
So, speaking of which,

493
00:29:48,808 --> 00:29:50,508
we have another
big event coming up.

494
00:29:50,543 --> 00:29:53,511
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do?

495
00:29:53,546 --> 00:29:55,513
Walt's birthday.

496
00:29:55,548 --> 00:29:58,115
Whatever you need, I'm here.

497
00:29:58,149 --> 00:30:00,785
Mm, yeah. I, um...

498
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:03,187
I don't think we're gonna
do anything this year.

499
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:04,688
What are you talking about?

500
00:30:04,722 --> 00:30:07,357
Of course we're
gonna do something.

501
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:10,961
Skyler, he was diagnosed
around his birthday, right?

502
00:30:10,995 --> 00:30:12,629
I...

503
00:30:12,663 --> 00:30:14,631
So it's been a whole year.

504
00:30:14,665 --> 00:30:17,067
Listen, I've had
my problems with Walt.

505
00:30:17,102 --> 00:30:19,502
Why he wouldn't come to the house
when we were all practically beg--

506
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:21,571
Whatever.
Water under the bridge.

507
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:24,207
But at this point, every
year is precious. We are--

508
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:25,841
What are you doing?

509
00:30:27,978 --> 00:30:29,678
You don't smoke.

510
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:30,713
You haven't smoked
since college.

511
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:32,582
You can't be serious!

512
00:30:32,616 --> 00:30:35,383
With the baby and Walt?

513
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:37,419
Skyler, you're not smoking
around the baby, are you?

514
00:30:37,453 --> 00:30:39,087
And you can't smoke here.

515
00:30:39,122 --> 00:30:41,977
There's gotta be some rule
or regulation, I'm sure.

516
00:30:42,104 --> 00:30:44,741
You can't force your
employees to breathe--

517
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,428
I know for a fact
that that is illegal.

518
00:30:46,462 --> 00:30:48,497
Marie, shut up.

519
00:30:48,531 --> 00:30:50,164
What?

520
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:52,533
I'm sorry. Please don't
speak to me like that.

That comes to 49.27.

00:31:38,322 --> 00:31:40,389

537
00:31:40,424 --> 00:31:43,659
That is an excellent yield.

Hey Marie.

543
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:30,770
How you doing?

544
00:32:34,775 --> 00:32:36,242
Where is Skyler?

545
00:32:36,277 --> 00:32:37,810
In the bedroom.
She's resting.

546
00:32:39,112 --> 00:32:41,446

what does that mean?

what else to call it.

But I've never seen her
like that, ever.

00:32:50,223 --> 00:32:53,826
Well, what did she say
when she was yelling?

551
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,894
Nothing.

552
00:32:54,928 --> 00:32:59,630
She just yelled, "Shut up, shut up,"
over and over again.

It's not a regular thing.

Oh, I just wish
I had gotten your message.

Please, God, tell me
the cancer isn't back.

No. It's not the cancer.

Well, something happened.

565
00:33:37,534 --> 00:33:43,339
I don't mean to point the finger,
but this didn't just come out of nowhere.

566
00:33:43,373 --> 00:33:45,606
It's time to tell me
the truth, Walt. All of it.

The accident?

572
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,192

Um...

A couple weeks back,

576
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:14,568
Ted took a fall--
a bad one.

577
00:34:14,602 --> 00:34:16,636
He gave himself a concussion,

578
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:19,272
and, uh, fractured
a couple vertebrae.

579

He's still in the hospital.

He may never walk again.

I-- I didn't--

happened, and she got...

00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,100
After the dealers
got their cut,

644
00:38:58,134 --> 00:39:04,039
we should be looking
at 1,379,560.

645
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,540
Mike, you're short.

646
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:08,977
You're almost 300,000 short.

647
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:10,646
You're forgetting
about the mules.

648
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,313
They get a flat 20%.

649
00:39:12,348 --> 00:39:13,981
- The what?
- The drivers.

650
00:39:14,016 --> 00:39:17,352
They're the ones that take the
product from us to the dealers.

651
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,024
And so, transportation
is worth 20%?

652
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:25,193
They are taking a risk.

653
00:39:26,595 --> 00:39:31,031
$275,000 worth of risk?

654
00:39:31,065 --> 00:39:34,201
Wow.

655
00:39:34,235 --> 00:39:36,470
What did Gus pay his mules?

656
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:39,306
Gustavo Fring didn't use mules.

657
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,807
He didn't need them.

658
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:43,677
He spent 20 years
building his own distribution.

659
00:39:43,711 --> 00:39:47,393
He had 16 refrigerator trucks
running his product.

660
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:49,266
And you know
where they are now?

661
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:51,684
Government impound.

662
00:39:51,718 --> 00:39:54,687
You don't like paying 20%?
Maybe you shouldn't have killed the guy.

663
00:39:54,721 --> 00:39:55,921
Hey, hey, hey.

664
00:39:55,955 --> 00:39:58,257
There's still over
a million bucks here, all right?

665
00:39:58,292 --> 00:40:00,025
That's for one cook.

666
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,860
And since you're putting on
the green eyeshade,

667
00:40:02,895 --> 00:40:04,862
my supplier and I
came to an agreement.

668
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:07,098
The methylamine
was free this time.

669
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:08,600
But brace yourself,

670
00:40:08,634 --> 00:40:11,469
because the next barrel
is gonna cost big.

671
00:40:12,938 --> 00:40:16,074
Can we continue, or you got
anymore burning questions?

672
00:40:18,076 --> 00:40:19,577
[No audible dialogue]

673
00:40:19,611 --> 00:40:21,078
Okay, kid.

674
00:40:21,112 --> 00:40:24,748
You fronted us 120,000
to get us going.

675
00:40:24,782 --> 00:40:31,888
So that's 40,000
from him and me.

676
00:40:31,923 --> 00:40:34,156
Yes. Thank you, Jesse.

677
00:40:34,191 --> 00:40:35,425
Okay.

678
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:39,962
Now, Ira gets 110,000
for our piece of the business

679
00:40:39,996 --> 00:40:42,632
and 25,000 per cook.

680
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:44,701
That is 45,000...

681
00:40:45,703 --> 00:40:48,003
from each of us.

682
00:40:53,175 --> 00:40:56,778
Ira's guys get
10,000 each per cook.

683
00:41:02,785 --> 00:41:06,454
Goodman's cut--
18,000 from each.

Legacy cost--

685
00:41:17,132 --> 00:41:19,433
$351,000.

686
00:41:19,468 --> 00:41:21,368
That's 117,000 each.

687
00:41:21,402 --> 00:41:22,835
"Legacy cost"?

688
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,971
I got nine guys.

689
00:41:25,005 --> 00:41:27,974
You don't know them, but they were
part of the previous operation,

690
00:41:28,008 --> 00:41:29,376
and they know a lot.

691
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,278
And right now,
some of them are in jail

692
00:41:31,312 --> 00:41:33,146
and more will be soon.

693
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,415
The feds Rico-ed
their hazard pay,

694
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:38,617
so <i>we</i> are gonna make 'em whole.

696
00:41:41,655 --> 00:41:43,622
What is this "we"?

697
00:41:43,657 --> 00:41:45,991
These were Gus's employees,
not ours.

698
00:41:46,025 --> 00:41:48,260
They might have been
Gus's employees,

but they're my guys.

700
00:41:50,463 --> 00:41:54,460
So what are they doing
to further our interests?

701
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:57,714
The cops are looking
at them very closely.

702
00:41:57,749 --> 00:42:01,039
We don't want them
furthering our interests.

703
00:42:01,073 --> 00:42:05,143
So we are paying them, why?

704
00:42:05,178 --> 00:42:09,313
Because it's what you do.

705
00:42:09,347 --> 00:42:11,182
Ohh.

706
00:42:11,216 --> 00:42:13,617
It's what you do.

One hand washes the other.
It's as simple as that.

Huh.

It sounds like
a simple shakedown,

simple as that.

714

We're paying for their silence.

715
00:42:31,368 --> 00:42:33,269
That's blackmail.

How are you feeling
about the money?

You're looking at it wrong.

752
00:44:56,939 --> 00:44:58,573
When we worked for Gus,

753
00:44:58,607 --> 00:45:00,875
we were cooking
200 pounds a week.

754
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:03,410
This last batch was great,

755
00:45:03,445 --> 00:45:05,812
but we didn't even
crack 50 pounds.

756
00:45:05,847 --> 00:45:09,415
We maybe cleared less money, but
we got a bigger piece of the pie.

757
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:13,286
It's like you said,
now we're owners,

Yeah. All this time

I was sure that
Gus did what he did

763
00:45:31,371 --> 00:45:33,372
to send me a message.

764
00:45:35,509 --> 00:45:38,643
Maybe there's another reason.

766
00:45:43,081 --> 00:45:46,116
Victor trying to cook
that batch on his own?

that weren't his to take?
