1
00:01:56,074 --> 00:02:01,204
May the Warrior grant him courage
and protect him in these perilous times.

2
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:05,708
May the Smith grant him strength
that he might bear this heavy burden.

3
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:10,088
And may the Crone,
she that knows the fate of all men,

4
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,799
show him the path he must walk

5
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,969
and guide him through
the dark places that lie ahead.

6
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:21,182
In the light of the Seven, I now proclaim
Tommen of the House Baratheon

7
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:25,728
First of His Name,
King of the Andals and the First Men

8
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,106
and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

9
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:35,822
-Long may he reign!
-Long may he reign!

10
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,457
Happy day.

11
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,270
Your Grace.

12
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,982
Your Grace.

13
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,593
-Your Grace.
-Your Grace.

14
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,567
Your Grace.

15
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,405
There he is.

16
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,118
-Long may he reign.
-Long may he reign.

17
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,500
He sits the throne like he was born to it.

18
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,003
Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?

19
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,673
No, he wasn't.

20
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,597
You still mourn for Joffrey?

21
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,810
-He was my husband. My king.
-He would have been your nightmare.

22
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:37,151
-Your Grace, I feel--
-You knew exactly what he was.

23
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,529
I did, too.

24
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,825
You never love anything in the world
the way you love your first child.

25
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,912
Doesn't matter what they do.

26
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,418
And what he did, it shocked me.

27
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,173
-Do you think I'm easily shocked?
-No.

28
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,760
The things he did shocked me.

29
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,227
He's only a boy.

30
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,189
A good boy. A decent boy.
He always has been.

31
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,818
Who was the last decent king, I wonder?

32
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,946
He could be the first man
who sits on that throne in 50 years

33
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,448
to actually deserve it.

34
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,827
It would be some consolation, wouldn't it?

35
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,872
For all the horror that put him there.

36
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,587
He will need help…

37
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,507
if he's going to rule well.

38
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,051
He has you.

39
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,386
A mother is not enough.

40
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,808
You're still interested
in being queen, I take it?

41
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,687
After all that's happened?

42
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,651
It sounds strange, I know, but I am--

43
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:05,073
I haven't even given any thought to it,
what comes next.

44
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,492
It would be a great honor, of course.

45
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,204
But I will have to speak
to my father about it.

46
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,833
Yes, speak to your father.

47
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,753
I'll speak to mine.

48
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,428
We may be faced with an alarming number
of weddings soon.

49
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,890
I won't even know what to call you.

50
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,267
Sister?

51
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,729
Or Mother?

52
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,569
King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.

53
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,240
Murdered at his own wedding.

54
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,701
And we have taken
the Meereenese navy, Your Grace.

55
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,537
The Second Sons
took the Meereenese navy.

56
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,749
-Who told you to take the navy?
-No one.

57
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:01,170
-So why did you do it?
-I heard you liked ships.

58
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,719
-How many ships?
-Ninety-three, Your Grace.

59
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,179
How many men can they carry?

60
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,890
Ninety-three hundred,
not counting sailors.

61
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,642
Would that be enough
to take King's Landing?

62
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,853
The Lannisters have more.

63
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,105
They've been fighting
Joffrey's wars for years.

64
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,608
They're tired, dispersed.
And now their king is dead.

65
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,988
Eight thousand Unsullied,
2,000 Second Sons,

66
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,826
sailing into Blackwater Bay
and storming the gates without warning.

67
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,999
It's hard to say. It could be enough.

68
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,419
But we're not fighting
to make you queen of King's Landing.

69
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,213
Ten thousand men can't conquer Westeros.

70
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,884
The old houses will flock to our queen
when she crosses the Narrow Sea.

71
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,636
The old houses will flock
to whichever side they think will win,

72
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,929
as they always have.

73
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,350
There's other news.

74
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,519
From Yunkai.

75
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,315
Without the Unsullied
to enforce your rule,

76
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,193
the Wise Masters
have retaken control of the city.

77
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,237
They've reenslaved
the freedmen who stayed behind

78
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,072
and sworn to take revenge against you.

79
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,492
And in Astapor,

80
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,579
the council you installed
to rule over the city

81
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,540
has been overthrown
by a butcher named Cleon

82
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,793
who's declared himself
"His Imperial Majesty."

83
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:26,422
Please leave me.

84
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,763
Not you, Jorah.

85
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:51,072
It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay
isn't going quite as planned.

86
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,827
You could sail for Westeros
and leave it all behind.

87
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,247
A boy sits on the Iron Throne.

88
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,291
A boy many believe
to be a bastard with no right to it.

89
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,211
They've never been more vulnerable.

90
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,506
You counseled me against rashness
once in Qarth.

91
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,591
I didn't listen.

92
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,261
That all worked out well.

93
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,481
How can I rule seven kingdoms
if I can't control Slaver's Bay?

94
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,277
Why should anyone trust me?

95
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,196
Why should anyone follow me?

96
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,741
You're a Targaryen.
You're the Mother of Dragons.

97
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,745
I need to be more than that.

98
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:51,257
I will not let those I have freed
slide back into chains.

99
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,761
-I will not sail for Westeros.
-What, then?

100
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,932
I will do what queens do.

101
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,229
I will rule.

102
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,641
Pull up your hood.

103
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,021
A memorable shade.

104
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,107
But how would they know?

105
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,444
You know what kind of stories
poor men enjoy the most?

106
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,405
Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.

107
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:05,664
-Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
-The mountains are impassable.

108
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,126
If you want to get to the Eyrie,
you need to go through the Bloody Gate.

109
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,172
It doesn't matter how large your army is,

110
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,591
if you attack this gate,
you do it on this road,

111
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,678
three men abreast
and get slaughtered like goats.

112
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,432
The first Lords of the Vale
didn't have much,

113
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,644
but they had these mountains
and they knew how to use them.

114
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,188
And the fortress they built here
has never been overcome.

115
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,607
Not once in 1,000 years.

116
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:38,197
Know your strengths, use them wisely,
and one man can be worth 10,000.

117
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:48,833
-Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
-Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.

118
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:56,966
-Stand to.
-Stand to!

119
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,885
Welcome back, Lord Baelish.

120
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,501
Uncle Petyr!

121
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,255
My lord.

122
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,809
I have brought you a gift.

123
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,025
-Lord Baelish.
-My lady.

124
00:12:56,358 --> 00:13:00,279
-Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.
-A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.

125
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,407
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.

126
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:07,077
-My name is Al--
-Do take down that hood, child.

127
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,705
Don't you think I know who you are?

128
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:14,251
You think I'd let my intended
leave the Eyrie on urgent business

129
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,712
without knowing what that business was?

130
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,218
I let him go
so he could bring you here to me.

131
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,057
My flesh and blood.

132
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,686
It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.

133
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,688
You mustn't call me that
in front of anyone else.

134
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,566
-Of course. I understand.
-No one can know you're here.

135
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,568
It would put us
in a very precarious position.

136
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,364
-I would never say a thing.
-The Lannisters want to destroy us.

137
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,576
They've been trying for years.
Now they know what it feels like.

138
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:51,580
Mummy said they killed your mother
and they chopped off your brother's head.

139
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,544
They did, and my father's.

140
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,338
They killed my father, too, with poison.

141
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,551
I wanted to make
the little Lannister baby man fly,

142
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,179
-but Mother said I couldn't.
-Make him fly?

143
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,765
Through the Moon Door.

144
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,941
And on top of everything else,
they made you marry that filthy troll?

145
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,861
They did. They made us both.
Lord Tyrion didn't want to.

146
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,824
I don't believe that for a moment.
Did he force himself on you?

147
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:33,455
-No. We never--
-Good. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa.

148
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,541
But you're not to call her Sansa
in front of anyone

149
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,710
but Uncle Petyr and myself.
Do you understand?

150
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,337
Sansa, this is my son Robin.

151
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,007
It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.

152
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,844
Robin, show Sansa to her chamber.
Take the back stairs.

153
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,933
Go. We'll speak soon.

154
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,611
What took you so long?

155
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,530
Arranging for the ascension
of King Tommen I,

156
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:10,117
extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.

157
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,163
She's here. We've spent more than enough
time on her for one evening.

158
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,835
-Let's get married tonight.
-Ought we not…

159
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,964
inform the Lords of the Vale
about the ceremony?

160
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,343
There's only one Lord of the Vale.
The others can all hang.

161
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,220
Lurking and simpering
on the stairs like buzzards

162
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,432
the moment my husband died,
trying to get their claws in me.

163
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:37,102
-I do think that we could wait until--
-I'm done waiting, Petyr.

164
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,938
We had our wedding night many years ago.

165
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,817
-Don't you remember?
-Like it was yesterday.

166
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:48,238
What wife would do for you
the things I've done for you?

167
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,159
What wife would trust you
the way I've trusted you?

168
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,206
When you gave me those drops
and told me to pour them into Jon's wine,

169
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,832
my husband's wine.

170
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:04,546
When you told me to write a letter to Cat
telling her it was the Lannisters--

171
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,560
The deed is done.

172
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,813
Faded into nothing.

173
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,024
Only speaking of it can make it real.

174
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,571
Tonight it is, then.

175
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,036
Let me bathe and dress for the occasion.

176
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,164
Once I'm presentable,
I'll call on the septon immediately.

177
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,840
I'm warning you.

178
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,511
I'm going to scream
when my husband makes love to me.

179
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,931
I'm going to scream so loud,

180
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:58,642
they'll hear me
clear across the Narrow Sea.

181
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,879
When will the wedding take place,
in your mind?

182
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,672
As soon as decency permits.

183
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,760
After we'νe allowed Tommen
the appropriate time to mourn his brother

184
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,554
and Margaery to mourn her husband.

185
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,598
-A fortnight?
-That seems reasonable.

186
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,226
No jugglers, no jousting dwarves,

187
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,271
no 77 course meals.

188
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,567
And your wedding to Loras?

189
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,320
Shortly after Tommen's.

190
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,614
-Shortly?
-A fortnight.

191
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,825
I know you don't like them.

192
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,036
I didn't like your husband.

193
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,540
Used to pat me on the back a lot.
I didn't trust him.

194
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,709
We had that in common.

195
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,129
You don't need to make formal alliances
with people you trust.

196
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,673
Then whom can we trust?

197
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,302
Ourselves alone.

198
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:22,518
The Tyrells are our only true rivals

199
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:27,481
in terms of resources
and we need them on our side.

200
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,234
Robert wasn't particularly rich.

201
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,820
Robert had me funding him.

202
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,782
Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.

203
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,785
I suppose that explains
why we did so well in the last one.

204
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:44,206
Do you know how much gold was mined
in the Westerlands this past year?

205
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,959
-Haven't a clue.
-Go on, your best guess.

206
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:52,089
-Pounds, tons, ounces?
-Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.

207
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:57,177
-That can't be.
-Our last working mine ran dry

208
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,262
three years ago.

209
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,889
Then how do we pay for anything?

210
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:05,686
The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos
a tremendous amount of money.

211
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:06,728
How much?

212
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,107
A tremendous amount.

213
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,654
There must be someone at the Iron Bank
you can speak to,

214
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,657
-come to some arrangement.
-The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.

215
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,284
There is no someone.

216
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,911
Someone does work there.
It is comprised of people.

217
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,247
And a temple is comprised of stones.

218
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,916
One stone crumbles
and another takes its place.

219
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,713
And the temple holds its form
for 1,000 years or more.

220
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,133
That's what the Iron Bank is, a temple.

221
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,511
We all live in its shadow
and almost none of us know it.

222
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,390
You can't run from them.
You can't cheat them.

223
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,934
You can't sway them with excuses.

224
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,479
If you owe them money
and you don't want to crumble yourself,

225
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,565
you pay it back.

226
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,736
Vesting the Tyrells in the crown
will help a great deal in this respect.

227
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,531
It's for the good of the family,
I understand that.

228
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,953
I'm not sure my brothers do.

229
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,045
I know you're building
a strong case against Tyrion.

230
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,505
And as a mother, that is your right.

231
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:20,093
But as a judge,
I cannot discuss the trial with you.

232
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,095
I respect that.

233
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,934
We don't need to discuss it.

234
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,940
The Lannister legacy
is the only thing that matters.

235
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,443
You've started wars
to protect this family.

236
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,448
Turned your back on Jaime
for refusing to contribute to its future.

237
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:47,245
What does Tyrion deserve
for lighting that future on fire?

238
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,632
Joffrey.

239
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,218
Cersei.

240
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,095
Walder Frey.

241
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,472
Meryn Trant.

242
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,474
Tywin Lannister.

243
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,185
The Red Woman.

244
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,313
Beric Dondarrion.

245
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,066
Thoros of Myr.

246
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,237
Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.

247
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,197
Would you shut up?

248
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,200
I can't sleep until I say the names.

249
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,288
The names of every fucking person
in Westeros?

250
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,541
Only the ones I'm going to kill.

251
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,753
Hate's as good a thing as any
to keep a person going.

252
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,422
Better than most.

253
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,467
We come across my brother,

254
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,138
maybe we can both
cross a name off our list.

255
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,852
If he were here right now,
what would you do?

256
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,572
I'd tell him to shut the fuck up
so I can get some sleep.

257
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:12,330
Go on, get it over with,
your list of doomed men.

258
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,126
I'm almost done.

259
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,795
Only one name left.

260
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,590
Go on.

261
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,558
The Hound.

262
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,275
Thank you.

263
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,110
Your mother always had a sweet tooth,
you know.

264
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,820
-Really?
-Oh, yes.

265
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,240
At suppertime,
she would go straight for honey cakes,

266
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,035
candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet.

267
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:54,498
Eventually, your grandfather had
to assign a septa to watch her at meals.

268
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,917
Cat was the firstborn daughter after all.

269
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,002
It was important that she remain desirable

270
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,004
so Father could arrange
a good match for her

271
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,632
and she was starting to get fat.

272
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,718
My mother, fat?

273
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,016
She never let me have my pudding
until I'd finished all my proper food.

274
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,311
This is before she married your father
and moved to the North.

275
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,773
By the time you were born,
your father's austerity had become hers.

276
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,359
Marriage changes people.

277
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:29,241
I didn't mean for you to stop.
Go on, enjoy them.

278
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,582
-How do you like them?
-They're delicious.

279
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,505
Where did you get the lemons?
You can't grow them up here.

280
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,756
Oh, gods, no.

281
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:48,135
Petyr had three crates brought
all the way from King's Landing.

282
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,555
-He knew you liked lemon cakes.
-He's so kind.

283
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,723
He really cares for you.

284
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:58,895
Think where you'd be without him.
In their clutches and tried for murder.

285
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:04,985
-Yes. I'm very lucky.
-He feels responsible for you.

286
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,237
-I know he does. I'm so grateful.
-Why?

287
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,907
Why does he feel responsible for you?

288
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,037
Well, I'm half Tully.
He loved your family so much.

289
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,247
-Loved your mother.
-No.

290
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,623
That's what you wanted to say.

291
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,375
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.
He's married to you.

292
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,502
Your mother never loved him. Never.

293
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,589
Cat always went straight
for the sweetest thing.

294
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,300
The most obvious thing.
Your Uncle Brandon.

295
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:31,595
Your handsome, arrogant,
cruel Uncle Brandon.

296
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:35,682
He almost killed Petyr in a duel.
And your mother loved him anyway.

297
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:39,936
And now Petyr is risking his life
to save you,

298
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,939
the daughter of a woman
who didn't love him

299
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,275
no more than those whores in his brothels.

300
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,612
-Has he told you about them?
-No.

301
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,531
He hasn't told you about the vile things
they do with their bodies?

302
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,825
The vile things they let him do
with their bodies?

303
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,286
-No, never.
-Are you pregnant?

304
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,373
What? No, I told you.
Lord Tyrion and I never--

305
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,000
I wasn't asking about Tyrion.

306
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,502
What have you let Petyr do
with your body?

307
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,380
-Aunt Lysa, no, I--
-Your young, pretty body.

308
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,091
-Nothing. I'm a virgin.
-Don't lie to me.

309
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,635
You're hurting me.

310
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,596
I'll know if you lie.

311
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,226
I'm a virgin, I swear it.
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.

312
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,269
All he says is that I'm stupid.

313
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,230
I'm a stupid little girl
with stupid dreams

314
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,315
who never learns and I'm a terrible liar,

315
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,609
so I should always tell the truth.
And I swear to you

316
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,028
that he has never touched me.
Not once, not ever.

317
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:38,370
It's all right. It will all be all right.
You'll be a widow soon.

318
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,830
They'll execute that dwarf
for murdering the king

319
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,832
and you'll be free to marry Robin.

320
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,085
You'll be the Lady of the Vale.

321
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,112
Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?

322
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,780
Yes, my lady, when I was young.

323
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,575
There wasn't much call for it
with Lord Tyrion, though.

324
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:22,247
-He preferred litters.
-Perhaps you should have stayed with him.

325
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,298
It's not going to be
a pleasant journey for you.

326
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,759
It could take weeks to get to the Wall,
depending on the weather.

327
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,344
That's a long way off.

328
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,222
Well, Lady Sansa's brother's
at Castle Black.

329
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,558
If I were her, that's where I'd go.

330
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:47,731
-Feel free to stop at any point.
-Never, my lady. I'm your squire.

331
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,108
I've made it this far in the world
without a squire.

332
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,528
-I don't see why I need one now.
-All knights have squires, my lady.

333
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:57,741
I'm not a knight. And I'm not a slaver,
either. I don't own you.

334
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:02,078
-I swore an oath, my lady.
-I am releasing you from that oath.

335
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,918
-That means you could leave.
-I know.

336
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,255
What do you think will happen
if you leave?

337
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,842
They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.

338
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,192
-The hell you doing?
-Practicing.

339
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,903
-What, ways to die?
-No one's going to kill me.

340
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,988
They will if you nance around like that.

341
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,282
That's no way to fight.

342
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,411
It's not fighting. It's water dancing.

343
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,121
Dancing?

344
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,540
Maybe you ought to put on a dress.

345
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:35,130
-Who taught you that shite?
-The greatest swordsman who ever lived.

346
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,344
Syrio Forel, the First Sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.

347
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,429
Braavos.

348
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,514
Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet.

349
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,434
-They all are.
-What do you know about anything?

350
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,769
I bet his hair is greasier
than Joffrey's cunt.

351
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,271
-It was not.
-Was?

352
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,480
-He dead?
-Yes.

353
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,940
-How?
-He was killed.

354
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,526
-Who by?
-Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn--

355
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,153
Meryn Trant?

356
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,406
The greatest swordsman who ever lived
killed by Meryn fucking Trant?

357
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,491
-He was outnumbered.
-Any boy whore with a sword

358
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,369
-could beat three Meryn Trants.
-Syrio didn't have a sword.

359
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,996
Or armor. Just a stick.

360
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,039
The greatest swordsman who ever lived
didn't have a sword?

361
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,879
All right. You have a sword.
Let's see what he taught you.

362
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,882
Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend.

363
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,801
Dead like all the rest of your friends.

364
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,816
Your friend's dead and Meryn Trant's not

365
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,862
'cause Trant had armor
and a big fucking sword.

366
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:15,647
-Your Grace.
-Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?

367
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:18,191
A poem, actually.

368
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,653
May I show you the gardens?

369
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,447
I couldn't very well refuse
a royal escort.

370
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,366
No, you couldn't.

371
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:33,206
-I didn't realize you were a poet.
-Not a very good one.

372
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:36,292
For your paramour?

373
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,421
-For one of my daughters.
-You have several, don't you?

374
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,383
-Eight.
-Eight?

375
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,804
-Eight daughters?
-The fifth is difficult.

376
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,890
I named her after my sister, Elia.

377
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,227
-Beautiful name.
-Yes.

378
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,230
But I can't say it without turning sad.

379
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:02,235
And after I turn sad, I grow angry.

380
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,821
Perhaps that's why she's difficult.

381
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,908
The gods love their stupid jokes,
don't they?

382
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,243
Which joke is that?

383
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,329
You're a prince of Dorne.

384
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,373
A legendary fighter.

385
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,167
A brilliant man
feared throughout Westeros.

386
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,878
But you could not save your sister.

387
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:26,551
I'm a Lannister. Queen for 19 years.
Daughter of the most powerful man alive.

388
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,262
But I could not save my son.

389
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,973
What good is power

390
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,684
if you cannot protect the ones you love?

391
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,938
-We can avenge them.
-Yes, we can avenge them.

392
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,359
You really believe
Tyrion murdered your son?

393
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,070
I know he did.

394
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,034
We will have a trial
and we will learn the truth.

395
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,453
We'll have a trial, anyway.

396
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,960
I haven't seen my daughter
in over a year.

397
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,046
The last time I saw her,

398
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,507
she was swimming with two
of my girls in the Water Gardens.

399
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:09,218
Laughing in the sun.

400
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,805
I want to believe that.

401
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,727
-I want to believe she's happy.
-You have my word.

402
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,522
We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.

403
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,985
Everywhere in the world,
they hurt little girls.

404
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,538
Would you bring her a gift from me?

405
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,084
I wasn't there for her name day.

406
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,127
I don't know when I'll see her again.

407
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:44,837
Anything at all.

408
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,927
The best shipwrights in King's Landing
have been working on it for months.

409
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,305
Myrcella loves the open water.

410
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,351
I will have it sailed down
to Sunspear for her.

411
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,105
Please tell her…

412
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:06,776
her mother misses her very much.

413
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,622
No, no, no.

414
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,792
Hells.

415
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,256
Gods.

416
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,010
Did you remove the skin?

417
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,933
-No, my lady.
-Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?

418
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,561
No, my lady.

419
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,897
Did you ever cook anything
for Lord Tyrion?

420
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,733
No, my lady.

421
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,652
That was the cooks.

422
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:10,965
-What are you doing?
-I'm helping you with your armor.

423
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:13,926
I've been removing my own armor
for quite some time, thank you very much.

424
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,155
What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?

425
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:38,117
I brought him his meals and cleared
his table when he was finished.

426
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,369
I kept his clothing and linens clean.

427
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,289
Carried his messages
and returned the replies.

428
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,001
Mostly I poured wine.

429
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,005
Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service,

430
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:53,883
did you ever do anything
remotely related to combat?

431
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,555
I killed a man.

432
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,560
Who?

433
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,980
A Kingsguard.

434
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:15,112
He tried to kill Lord Tyrion
at the Blackwater.

435
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,785
How did you kill a Kingsguard?

436
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,915
I pushed a spear
through the back of his head.

437
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:38,803
Bloody ridiculous.

438
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,059
Help me with these straps.

439
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,915
Hey. Hey, get up.

440
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,251
Get up.

441
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,011
That's it lad, put it inside.

442
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,013
Get the fire going again.
We're all freezing.

443
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,307
-Aye, they need it in there don't they.
-I promise I'll do it.

444
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,850
I've got to have a piss.

445
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,531
Now keep quiet.

446
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,824
You need water.

447
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,579
-It doesn't matter.
-Of course, it matters.

448
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,085
You mustn't let anything stop you.

449
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:37,964
They already have stopped me.

450
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,549
No.

451
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,221
You're not here.

452
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,562
You're far from here.

453
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,650
What does that mean?

454
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,408
At the hill.

455
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,953
A great weir wood tree.

456
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,707
You've seen it, too.

457
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,877
Meera and I, even Hodor,

458
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,339
we're only here to guide you.

459
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:25,970
He's waiting for you.

460
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,057
We have to find it.

461
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,477
You have to make it.

462
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,022
We will.

463
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,484
This… this isn't the end.

464
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,654
Not for you.

465
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,323
Not yet.

466
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,409
How…

467
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,120
will we know the end?

468
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,259
You'll know.

469
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,690
Brothers.

470
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,527
You do move quiet.

471
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,199
-How many?
-Eleνen men.

472
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,909
Most of them already drunk.

473
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,746
No guards posted. They don't seem
to have a care in the world.

474
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,915
We'll carve them up like walnut pie.

475
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,376
Karl was the top paid cutthroat
in Flea Bottom.

476
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,506
-I've seen what he can do with a knife.
-Have you seen what I can do with a knife?

477
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,092
Not yet.

478
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,429
There's a hut
on the west side of the keep.

479
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,765
-We should steer clear of it.
-Why?

480
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,518
They've got some hounds chained up inside.

481
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,230
Closer we can get without the dogs
sniffing us, the better.

482
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,108
New moon tonight.

483
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,363
Get some rest.

484
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,865
We move at sundown.

485
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,203
I've always liked a girl with curls.

486
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,080
A touch of class.

487
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,207
You take whatever's left.

488
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,629
Get her up.

489
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,467
Stop. Stop. What are you doing?

490
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:33,514
-Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
-Stop. Stop!

491
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,475
-Hodor. Hodor.
-Stop!

492
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,729
-Please.
-Hodor.

493
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,858
-Please, get off her!
-Hodor. Hodor.

494
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,360
Please! Please, leave her alone!

495
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,157
-Please, stop. Stop.
-Hey. Hey!

496
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,368
-What are you doing? Leave her alone!
-Hodor. Hodor.

497
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:55,828
No!

498
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,299
You've got pretty hair, don't you?

499
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,095
Now what is a pretty
little highborn girl like you

500
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,598
doing out here in the deep,
dark woods, eh?

501
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:21,187
You left your daddy's castle
looking for trouble, didn't you?

502
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,314
No dresses for you.

503
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,775
You like it rough, don't you?

504
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,529
You like it in the gutter, don't you?

505
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,490
If you let my sister go, I can help you.

506
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,412
-You can help me?
-I can.

507
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:42,541
And how you gonna do that?

508
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,840
I have the sight. I can see things.

509
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,802
-That's very helpful.
-Things that haven't happened yet.

510
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,725
What a fine thing.

511
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:04,855
A fine thing.

512
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,777
Have you seen what I'm gonna do
to your sister?

513
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:16,283
Have you seen what they're going to do
to your sister?

514
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:19,787
No.

515
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,792
Don't close your eyes.

516
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,508
I saw you die tonight.

517
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,346
I saw your body burn.

518
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,725
I saw the snow fall and bury your bones.

519
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:47,022
To arms!

520
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,692
They're here, the Night's Watch.

521
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,598
Rescue party is here, lads.

522
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,102
-Lady.
-Is Jon with you?

523
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,103
Aye.

524
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,480
I'll take you to him.

525
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,319
You're Brandon Stark?

526
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:40,659
Hodor.

527
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,662
The little crippled lord.
We're going for a ride, boy.

528
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,247
Jon! Jon!

529
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:46,874
-Keep talking...
-Leave him alone!

530
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,543
...and I'll cut your friends' throats.

531
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:52,546
-Starting with the idiot. Do you hear?
-Hodor. Hodor.

532
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:54,923
Do you hear?

533
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:08,979
Hodor! Hodor!

534
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,816
Hodor. Hodor.

535
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,652
Hodor. Hodor.

536
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,449
Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.

537
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:04,284
Hodor.

538
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,957
Hodor, get his knife. Cut me loose.

539
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:14,294
-Hodor, get his knife.
-Hodor.

540
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,381
Cut me loose, Hodor.

541
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,473
Jojen and Meera, free them.

542
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,267
Go!

543
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,355
Jon.

544
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,616
Jon!

545
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,662
If he sees you,
he won't let you go north.

546
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,582
-He's my brother.
-And wants to protect you.

547
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,834
He'll take you back to Castle Black.

548
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,045
You have to decide.

549
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,590
Do you want to find the three-eyed raven?

550
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,482
-Hodor.
-Hodor.

551
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,400
We need to free Summer.

552
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:20,986
And we need to go.

553
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,336
Lord Snow.

554
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,380
Are you bringing me back for trial?

555
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:44,593
We had a good thing here.

556
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:46,970
We were free men.

557
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,348
You'll never be free.

558
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,434
You'll never know what that's like.

559
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,541
You learn how to fight in a castle?

560
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,300
Some old man teach you how to stand,
how to parry?

561
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,181
How to fight with honor?

562
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,238
You know what's wrong with honor?

563
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,709
You.

564
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,117
Are you all right?

565
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,455
Come with me.

566
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,374
Come on.

567
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,060
We lost four brothers?

568
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:00,646
Five.

569
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,318
What the seven hells could do that
to a man?

570
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:10,781
I count ten dead mutineers.

571
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,909
Locke said there were 11 of them.

572
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:16,745
Where's Rast?

573
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,791
-Here's another.
-Jon.

574
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,422
Where in seven hells?

575
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,299
Come here.

576
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,100
I missed you, boy.

577
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,273
What should we do with this lot?

578
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,655
It's not safe for you here on your own.

579
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,951
Mance Rayder has an army heading this way
and there's worse out there than Mance.

580
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,165
Come with us to Castle Black.

581
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,710
We can find you work. Keep you safe.

582
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:52,841
Meaning all respect, Ser Crow,
Craster beat us and worse.

583
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:57,679
Your brother crows beat us and worse.
We'll find our own way.

584
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,723
You want to stay here?

585
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,058
In Craster's Keep?

586
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:10,567
Burn it to the ground
and all the dead with it.
