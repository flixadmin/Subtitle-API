00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,930
<i>This season on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

3
00:00:02,934 --> 00:00:03,934
I've assembled you all

4
00:00:03,938 --> 00:00:05,338
because I need your help.

5
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,739
<i>The future of the world
is in peril</i>

6
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,740
<i>because of Vandal Savage.</i>

7
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,176
<i>You've turned your back
on the very institution</i>

8
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,878
you were meant to serve.

9
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,810
<i>The Time Masters,
they refuse</i>

10
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,215
<i>to take action
against Savage</i>

11
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:18,217
because he didn't pose a threat
to the timeline.

12
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,186
The Oculus not only
gives us a window into time,

13
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,422
- but the ability to shape it.
- <i>If the Oculus</i>

14
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:24,924
<i>is what they're using
to control us,</i>

15
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:26,858
then we need to destroy it.

16
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,693
Shut it down!

17
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,296
There are no strings on me.

18
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,467
He traded his life for ours.
He was a hero.

19
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:38,036
<i>Unfortunately, Vandal Savage
has already succeeded</i>

20
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,272
<i>in murdering
Miranda and Jonas.</i>

21
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,307
<i>Savage still has
Carter and Kendra.</i>

22
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,742
This is a timeship.

23
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:45,477
A little gift
from our friends.

24
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,612
I no longer need
to rule the world.

25
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,614
I now have the ability
to change it.

26
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,763
What are we doing
back here?

27
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,933
Savage has a timeship,
courtesy of the Time Masters.

28
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,101
The timeline is unclear,
due to our destruction

29
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:13,672
of the Oculus, meaning
Savage is lost to history.

30
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,974
Which is why
I brought you all home.

31
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:18,410
- Mission's not over, man.
- Jax is right.

32
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,612
We've lost Savage before.
We'll find him again.

33
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,013
And then what?
We have no way

34
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,515
of killing Savage,
particularly now

35
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:24,947
that Kendra and Carter
are in his possession,

36
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,418
assuming that
they're still alive,

37
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,860
which is highly unlikely.

38
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,240
So that's it? We're...
we're just giving up?

39
00:01:30,244 --> 00:01:32,757
I'm on my way to the refuge to
retrieve our younger selves

40
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,793
and return them
to the timeline.

41
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,328
It will be as if
you never left.

42
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,596
What, you think
that we can just

43
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,631
return to our old lives,
and then pretend

44
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:42,200
like none of this
ever happened?

45
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,336
Mm, that might be
a tad difficult.

46
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:48,538
So I had to bring you back to
May 2016, not January 2016.

47
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,442
Great, so what you're saying
is for the last five months,

48
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,605
my mom probably thinks
that I'm dead.

49
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,848
- Thanks a lot, man.
<i>- Okay, wait, why?</i>

50
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,850
Why the change of plans, Rip?

51
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,287
If you're getting back
on that ship,

52
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,322
we get back on that ship.

53
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:07,692
In truth, I never left it.

54
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:13,665
I'm sorry for all
that I've asked of you,

55
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:17,969
and that it all
came to nothing.

56
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,671
I wish you all well.

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
I never liked that guy.

58
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:40,855
Hello?
Hello?

59
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,661
Dad.

60
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,564
Hey.

61
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,766
- Hi, Daddy.
- Baby.

62
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,502
- When'd you get back?
- I just got back.

63
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,764
I tried calling,
but nobody was answering.

64
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,873
I was at Laurel's,
but she wasn't there.

65
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,600
Where is everyone?

66
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,299
This, uh, Damien Darhk,
he's causing problems.

67
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,800
Well, good to know nothing's
changed in five months.

68
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,953
Dad?

69
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:09,187
What's wrong?

70
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,189
Is everything okay?

71
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,460
No, baby.

72
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,962
You're starting
to scare me.

73
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:26,404
Damien Darhk was in prison,
and he escaped,

74
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:30,375
and everyone tried to...

75
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,943
...stop him.

76
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,779
But your sister, honey,

77
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,115
she, um...

78
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,584
No, dad.
No.

79
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,987
- I'm sorry, baby.
- No, dad.

80
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,422
No.

81
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,692
I got you.

82
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,169
You idiot.
We're in the clear.

83
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,437
He was going after us.

84
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,339
On foot.
You shot him,

85
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,942
- and wasted ammo.
- Cops are coming.

86
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,245
You want to
yell at me some more,

87
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,246
or should we both
get out of here?

88
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,182
Neither.

89
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,488
Hey, Mick.

90
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,989
Oh, it... it's me.

91
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,925
It's Ray.

92
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,695
I-I thought
we should talk.

93
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,430
Drive.

94
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,468
Well you didn't
waste any time

95
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,936
getting back
to your old habits.

96
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,640
I like stealing stuff.
It makes me feel good.

97
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,975
Did you ever think
that maybe you weren't meant

98
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:40,178
to do this anymore?

99
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,715
What do you want, haircut?

100
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:48,053
To apologize, sort of.

101
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,622
For Snart.

102
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,457
I was the one who
was supposed to die,

103
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,293
- and I can't help feeling that...
- It wasn't your fault.

104
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,125
It was his.

105
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,166
Son of a bitch never did
anything without a plan.

106
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,634
Maybe you're right.

107
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,469
Maybe he wanted this.

108
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,471
What are you doing
with your hand?

109
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,541
Maybe he wanted us to,
you know,

110
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:12,210
be partners.

111
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,978
Think I'm going to be sick.

112
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,313
I think Snart knew.

113
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,215
He knew that
I'd keep an eye out for you,

114
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,484
and you'd keep
an eye out for me.

115
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,220
While doing what?

116
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,589
What we haven't
finished doing.

117
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:33,832
What was H.G. Wells'
childhood nickname?

118
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,234
- Bertie.
- Incredible.

119
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,436
You've gotten every answer
correct tonight.

120
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,739
Since when did you become
such a history buff?

121
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,775
I guess I developed
a passion for it recently.

122
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:47,278
During your sabbatical?

123
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,881
You hardly ever
talk about it.

124
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:53,384
Martin?

125
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,754
I know, I'm sorry.

126
00:05:55,756 --> 00:06:00,458
My sabbatical was, um...

127
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:06,064
I left some very important
work unfinished.

128
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,700
Ship's not
going to be here, Gray.

129
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,735
We saw it take off,
remember?

130
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:15,940
Yes, and in doing so,
it would have left...

131
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,742
quantum signature.

132
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,578
That's what I've been
trying to tell Mick.

133
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,814
Radio beacon.
Quantum entangler.

134
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,649
Boring.

135
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:27,652
When do we get
in contact with Hunter?

136
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,056
Ms. Lance,
are you all right?

137
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,893
How do we get the Waverider
back here?

138
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:41,666
- Hi, daddy, we miss you.
- And love you.

139
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,669
- And love you.
<i>- Captain,</i>

140
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,971
<i>I'm sorry to interrupt.</i>

141
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,840
Tell me
you've located Savage.

142
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:51,743
<i>No, but we have received
a transmission</i>

143
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,578
<i>from 2016 Star City.</i>

144
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:58,616
I don't understand.
This should have worked.

145
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,518
Did you account
for subspace interference?

146
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,287
It's the first thing
I thought of.

147
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,022
Did you adjust
for temporal polarity?

148
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,423
Oh, Raymond, you insult me.

149
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,525
Can you reach
the Waverider or not?

150
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,195
We're working on it.

151
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:13,965
Actually, guys,
I think it just worked.

152
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:31,883
I thought I made my intentions
perfectly clear.

153
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:35,653
And we wish to be
equally clear about ours.

154
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,355
- Do you mind?
- Just checking to see

155
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:38,557
if you're real this time.

156
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,518
You're not
ditching us again.

157
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:43,427
When the mission's over, then we
can all go our separate ways.

158
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,500
And this mission
is not over.

159
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,125
Yeah, just curious
how much headway you've had

160
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,033
tracking Savage
without all of us.

161
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,635
None.

162
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,937
But neither
have I got myself

163
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,839
into bar fights
in 1975 and the old west,

164
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,170
put dwarf star technology
into the hands of terrorists,

165
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,836
or got myself turned into
a scary bird monster.

166
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,805
We get your point.

167
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,314
Now get ours.

168
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,315
That ship's not taking off
without us.

169
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,818
You got that?

170
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,269
Halt!

171
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,770
Oh, please don't shoot!
Don't shoot.

172
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,454
What the hell are you doing
out here, lady?

173
00:08:28,456 --> 00:08:29,906
I was being held captive.

174
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,776
By Nazis?

175
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,278
No, worse.

176
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,179
- Your helmet.
- What about it?

177
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,113
I've seen it before.

178
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,679
Paper, do you have paper?
Something to write with.

179
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,687
Lady, I think
you're in shock.

180
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,021
Please!

181
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,423
Yeah.

182
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,129
So if it wasn't Nazis,
who were you running from?

183
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,464
I need your helmet.

184
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,466
Now!

185
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,787
I'm sorry, my love,

186
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:19,557
but this game
is not over yet.

187
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,638
Despite my wishes
to pursue Savage alone,

188
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,173
it seems that
you're all intent

189
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,135
on seeing this thing through
till the bitter...

190
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,273
Oh!
Speaking of bitter.

191
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,610
You knew.

192
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,514
You dropped us off
five months later

193
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,816
because you knew.

194
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:46,221
Knew what?

195
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,687
You knew that Laurel
was going to die,

196
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,523
and now you're going
to take me back,

197
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,593
and I'm going to
save my sister.

198
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,395
- I'm afraid that that...
- You should be afraid.

199
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,969
I can't allow you...

200
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,830
I don't care
about the timeline.

201
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,200
You're taking me back now.

202
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,509
Look, Sara,
I'm sure there's

203
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,740
a valid reason
why Rip didn't...

204
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,005
Stay out of this!

205
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,616
What the hell, Rip?

206
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,186
Mr. Rory, take Ms. Lance
to sleep it off.

207
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,955
Not to dismiss
what just happened,

208
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,057
but we do have to
find Savage,

209
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,059
assuming that Kendra and Carter
are still on his timeship.

210
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,961
He could...
be anywhere in time and space.

211
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,063
Oh, well that
narrows it down a lot.

212
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:40,138
Sorry.

213
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,670
Was this always over here?

214
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,974
No, it lives over...

215
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:47,177
- Did you put it there?
- Nah, man.

216
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,880
- Did you?
- Dude, it's just a helmet.

217
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,052
- Chronometric repositioning.
- What?

218
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,354
Temporal changes can,
on occasion,

219
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,089
reverberate
through the timeline,

220
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,223
physically moving an object

221
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,560
from one place to another.

222
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:12,997
- Gideon?
- <i>Yes, Captain.</i>

223
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,330
Plot a course
for Saint-Lô, France, 1944.

224
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,640
Why then?

225
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,305
Because that's where
Kendra is.

226
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,847
How is that possible?

227
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,782
She sent us
a message through time.

228
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,784
Go ahead, say it.

229
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,086
Astonishing.

230
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Oh.

231
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,696
I brought you some company.

232
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,699
Oh, he might be
a little disoriented,

233
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,102
after the way
he came out of stasis.

234
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:47,839
- I know you.
- Oh, you remember her?

235
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,108
Well, his mind
isn't fully gone.

236
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,510
Hey!
Stay away from him!

237
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:55,380
I'm going to kill you.

238
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,949
You've had 4,000 years
to do so,

239
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:01,552
with no success.

240
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,787
What are you doing?

241
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:05,023
Your blood is the key
to unlocking

242
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:07,125
the Thanagarian technology.

243
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:10,595
- Thanagarian?
- The alien species which gave

244
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,965
the three of us our powers.

245
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,767
<i>They sent three meteorites</i>

246
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:19,304
<i>containing technology
beyond human understanding.</i>

247
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,472
<i>When they are activated
by your blood,</i>

248
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,541
I will be able
to erase time itself,

249
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:26,077
and travel us back
to 1700 B.C.

250
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,046
- No. No!
- I will begin

251
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,782
my immortal life anew,
only this time

252
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:34,218
I won't be content to whisper in
the ears of powerful men.

253
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,422
This time I will be the one
with the power.

254
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,424
I will be a god.

255
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,970
Please try very hard
not to kill me.

256
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,674
Rip.

257
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:59,310
Please take me back.

258
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,979
I need your help.

259
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,947
I need to save my sister.

260
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,449
And you know that I would
do this for you, Sara,

261
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,952
but I just can't.

262
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:10,487
I've never asked you
for anything.

263
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,090
And you of all people
should understand.

264
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,693
You have tried everything.
We...

265
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,200
We have tried everything
to save your family.

266
00:13:17,237 --> 00:13:21,037
And I would not wish the pain
of that failure upon anyone.

267
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,301
I would rather live
with that pain than this.

268
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,036
And that's just the thing,
Sara.

269
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:28,038
Look, if you were able
to try to save Laurel,

270
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,541
then you wouldn't
be alive at all.

271
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,142
Then fine.
I don't care.

272
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,113
When we left,
when I recruited you,

273
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:37,515
we... we... we altered
the timeline.

274
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:40,151
Now had it remained the same,
then Damien Darhk would have...

275
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,886
He would have killed

276
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:45,890
not only you and...
and your sister,

277
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,860
but your father as well.

278
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:53,131
But, Rip, if... if we go back,

279
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,632
and we take the team...

280
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,534
the outcome would be
exactly the same.

281
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:58,196
You don't know that.

282
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,904
- I'm afraid that I do.
- No.

283
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,740
I...

284
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,841
There's got to be a way.

285
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,544
Rip, I have to be able
to do something.

286
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:09,213
I'm so sorry.

287
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,556
Look, I can't.

288
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,391
Can't do this
without my sister.

289
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,553
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

290
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:27,765
You are one of the strongest
people I have ever met, Sara.

291
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:33,836
Laurel... Laurel may be
beyond your saving,

292
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,840
but Kendra and Carter,

293
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,710
they might not be.

294
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:44,715
<i>Captain, we are prepared
to make the time jump to 1944.</i>

295
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,554
We're on our way, Gideon.

296
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,700
<i>We've arrived in Saint-Lô.</i>

297
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,969
<i>No sign of Kendra yet,
but I have located</i>

298
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,604
<i>Vandal Savage,
and he does not</i>

299
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,606
<i>seem to be alone.</i>

300
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,766
Aah!

301
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,440
Get them!

302
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,943
Aah!

303
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,479
Keep Savage
and our Nazi friends occupied.

304
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,281
Gideon has detected
a temporal signature

305
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,482
consistent with a timeship.

306
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,084
If Kendra and Carter
are alive,

307
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,186
<i>that is where
they're going to be.</i>

308
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,188
Yeah, I see it.

309
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,701
- Jax.
- You miss me?

310
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,674
Is he still nuts?

311
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:19,944
No, he's okay.

312
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,813
Take this to the ship.

313
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:36,894
What the hell was that?

314
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:39,564
<i>You transmuted the molecular
properties of the rifle.</i>

315
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,465
What does that even mean?

316
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,868
Okay, let's get out of here.

317
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:56,314
Kendra's down.

318
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,182
Rip, we're kind of
outnumbered here.

319
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,318
Fall back.
Staying here to fight Nazis

320
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,587
<i>is exacerbating the damage
that we have already</i>

321
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:03,889
done to the timeline.

322
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,224
- But Kendra...
<i>- is alive,</i>

323
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:07,491
thankfully,
and we will rescue her

324
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,560
in due course.

325
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,095
I hope.

326
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,975
- So this is a spaceship?
- It's a timeship,

327
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:26,677
but yes, it does also travel
through space.

328
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,779
You... you've seen it before,
Mr. Hall.

329
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:32,350
That used to be my name.
Carter Hall.

330
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,884
There really is rather a lot
to fill you in on,

331
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,953
and we really do not
have the time.

332
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:36,988
- What about...
- Kendra, yes,

333
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,155
we need your assistance

334
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,523
in locating her and Savage.

335
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,025
Perhaps we can start
with what Savage

336
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,127
was doing in 1944.

337
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:47,629
He said something about, um...
Thanagarian technology.

338
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,900
- Thanagarian...
- The Thanagarians

339
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,403
were a race
of extraterrestrials.

340
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,871
He also said
that this technology

341
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:56,574
was actually three meteors.

342
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,576
<i>Captain,
I have surveillance footage</i>

343
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,011
<i>which might be relevant.</i>

344
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:02,680
Thank you, Gideon.

345
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,349
I've seen that rock before.

346
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,318
Savage had one of those
in 1958.

347
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,487
He took our blood.
He said he would use it

348
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,489
in a ritual to erase time,

349
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:14,492
take the blood
back to 1700 B.C.

350
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,265
- What are you doing?
- Come on, man.

351
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,566
We got to try it again.

352
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,068
That thing that we did
in world war ii.

353
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,704
- It's called transmutation.
- Yeah.

354
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,072
It's a similar process
by which

355
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:30,841
our uniform materializes
when we merge,

356
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,276
but at the moment,
we need to focus

357
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,879
on figuring out
what Savage is planning.

358
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:38,416
Come on, just the once.

359
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:41,352
Is that Raymond and Kendra's
lucky vase?

360
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:44,255
I don't know, I just found
this junk lying around.

361
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,923
Oh, come on.
Don't you think that

362
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:47,391
turning something
into something else

363
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:50,294
might come in handy?

364
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,797
All right, one time only.

365
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,632
Okay, just the once.

366
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:01,072
All right.

367
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,544
You need to focus, Jefferson.

368
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:08,913
Why do you always say it
like I'm not focusing?

369
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,748
<i>Just do
what you did before.</i>

370
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,084
Ah, before we had a Nazi
trying to kill us.

371
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:15,252
This is just a vase.

372
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:25,329
Come on.

373
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,799
I never thought
I'd utter these words,

374
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,568
but I think we need a Nazi.

375
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,169
- Not funny.
- Look, the reason I keep

376
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,771
telling you to focus
is because

377
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,973
transmutation is a literal
function of mind over matter.

378
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:37,926
Dude, this sucks.

379
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,930
Why do I always got to
be in the driver's seat?

380
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,100
Oh, don't
despair, Jefferson.

381
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:43,147
This is only
our second attempt

382
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,582
at transmutation,
and, you know,

383
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:48,386
they always say,
"the third time's a charm".

384
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,489
What?

385
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:54,692
Third time.
Three rituals.

386
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,595
I-I think I know
what Savage is planning to do.

387
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,668
I figured out how Savage
plans to erase time.

388
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,538
I believe he intends to detonate
each of these meteors

389
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,440
in a different time period.

390
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,808
How can you
destroy the world

391
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,511
three times
in three different times?

392
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,946
You can't, it would create
a temporal paradox.

393
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,314
Which would result
in a timequake

394
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,876
that would return
the Earth to the point

395
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,045
of the first
chronothermic reaction,

396
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,053
ancient Egypt.

397
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,760
Okay, it's official.

398
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,689
This is the craziest
bad guy plan

399
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,291
in the history
of bad guy plans.

400
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,053
I don't think that sanity
is a yardstick

401
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,161
by which Vandal Savage can
be measured.

402
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,127
Okay, so which time periods
are we talking here?

403
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,799
You said Savage
was in possession

404
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:37,368
of one of these meteorites
in 1958.

405
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,303
That was a year
of a rare alignment,

406
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:40,971
with the Earth
and Thanagar.

407
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,674
Evidently he got hold of
a second meteorite in 1944.

408
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,643
Which would be
useless to him in a year

409
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,511
where Earth and Thanagar
weren't in alignment.

410
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:50,815
Now, if my math is correct,
and trust me, it is,

411
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:53,250
the next two years
that Earth and Thanagar

412
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:57,988
are in sync
are 1975 and 2021.

413
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,557
But Savage
still has to do this

414
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,659
in three different
time periods.

415
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:05,921
That's the beauty of
immortality, Jefferson: He can.

416
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:09,500
<i>He can literally be
in three places at once.</i>

417
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,686
- Can't be.
- Can.

418
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:31,922
Thanks to time travel,
and it's because of time travel

419
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,557
that I know you're here.

420
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,860
You're out here tonight,
because you have felt

421
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:38,529
an immanent presence of...

422
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,698
Something.

423
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,933
- A... a meteorite?
- And I'm going to give you

424
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:45,035
a use for it
which will give us the power

425
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,905
to rewrite destiny itself.

426
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,307
Change the course
of the entire world.

427
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,016
So if Savage plans on blowing
up the world three times,

428
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,226
- how do we stop him?
- We don't.

429
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:10,761
- We kill him.
- How?

430
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:12,196
We've always known
that only you

431
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:13,564
or Kendra could kill Savage

432
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,132
using items exposed,
as you were,

433
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,734
to the meteor's radiation.

434
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:18,202
Now,
the radiation works both ways.

435
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:20,137
It gave Savage
his immortality, but...

436
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,972
it also makes him
vulnerable.

437
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:23,774
And Savage
is about to unleash

438
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,809
the radiation
from three meteorites

439
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,379
in three different
time periods.

440
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:30,548
- Triple the exposure.
- Yes.

441
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:35,119
Which should be sufficient
to render Savage mortal.

442
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:37,655
And then all we got to do
is kill Savage three times.

443
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,256
Indeed.
Gideon can navigate

444
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:40,258
the Waverider,
and we can split

445
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:41,625
into teams of two.

446
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:44,662
One in 1958, one in 1975,

447
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:47,331
and one in 2021.

448
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:53,137
Open it.

449
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:55,839
Did you know that this is one of
the original meteorites

450
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,341
which fell upon
the middle kingdom?

451
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,611
Drawn from the ground
after a millennia,

452
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:03,613
straight into Nazi hands.

453
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,349
The object that has bound
the two of us together

454
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:07,451
for 4,000 years
has the power

455
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:11,422
to take us back
to where it all began.

456
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:15,084
But this time,
I will be the Pharaoh,

457
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:17,324
- and you...
- will hate you,

458
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,330
like I've always hated you.

459
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:24,968
Patience, Mr. Hall.

460
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:27,237
<i>All our teams need to act
simultaneously.</i>

461
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,012
I think that's a comet
or something.

462
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:38,514
It's a meteorite,
in point of fact.

463
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,684
I was drawn to it as well.

464
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,985
- When can I kill him?
- We have to wait

465
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:47,291
- for the meteor to go critical.
- When's that?

466
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:49,593
When he starts the ritual
in all three time periods.

467
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,565
Um, we got
a nuclear bomb, here.

468
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,800
Professor, Jax,
we need you.

469
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:02,339
Oh, man, I forgot how much
of a badass I was.

470
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:06,310
Look.

471
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:12,016
What do you mean
you don't have the money?

472
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:13,851
I was going to sell
a nuclear warhead

473
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:17,154
and pay you
out of the profit.

474
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:18,656
Things changed.
You expect me

475
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:20,391
to just hand
the meteor over for free?

476
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:37,675
No, I expected
to take it from you by force.

477
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:45,115
Ah.

478
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:59,563
Well...
I think that's our cue.

479
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:04,268
Really?
These guys again?

480
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:09,073
Now.

481
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:14,078
Keep them occupied.

482
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,145
You ready to show
these fools

483
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,280
what's really good?

484
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:18,482
You have no idea.

485
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:25,989
Glad we're past the point
of worrying about the timeline.

486
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,401
Carter!

487
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:41,071
Aah!

488
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:49,480
Ah.

489
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,153
Oh, you're too late.

490
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:59,490
Time master's never late.

491
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:14,938
Rip!

492
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,007
Aah!

493
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:28,545
You can't kill me.

494
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,214
I'm immortal.

495
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,549
Guess you haven't
heard the news.

496
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,121
Good-bye,
my love.

497
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:47,731
Aah!

498
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:53,070
Aah!
Oh!

499
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:55,105
Ah, you can feel it,
can't you?

500
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:56,640
Things are different
this time.

501
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:02,112
- You're mortal.
- But yet, my death

502
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:06,250
does not save the lives
of your family.

503
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:08,819
I may die, but you'll live

504
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:12,489
knowing that you failed
to save the lives of...

505
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:13,590
aah!

506
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,466
Never speak
their names again.

507
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:51,161
Do something, Robocop.

508
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:52,296
I'm on it.
Got a little trick

509
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:53,297
I've been working on.

510
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:05,342
Ooh.

511
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:07,110
<i>It's up to you now,
Jefferson.</i>

512
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,279
Gray, listen.
If we're going to do this,

513
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:10,881
we got to do it together.

514
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:12,449
It's going to take
the two of us, all right?

515
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:16,153
<i>- You're right.
- Okay.</i>

516
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:19,957
Come on, Gray!

517
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,068
Oh, man.
You got my boots wet.

518
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,302
<i>Jefferson, you did it!</i>

519
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,237
We did it, man.

520
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,974
Gideon,
take us back to Rip.

521
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,087
Damn it!

522
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:52,489
I wanted to be
the one to kill him.

523
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:54,091
Again, I mean.

524
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,328
Um...

525
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,397
I don't think
our problems are over yet.

526
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:08,338
I'm on it.

527
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,844
On what?

528
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:15,412
It's not working.

529
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:17,214
<i>The radiation buildup
is too progressive.</i>

530
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:18,849
I got this.

531
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,056
I don't understand.

532
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,424
I must be all out of power.

533
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,793
What happens if only one of
these goes off?

534
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:32,896
Uh...
Time will remain intact.

535
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:34,364
The world?

536
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:35,599
Not so much.

537
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,806
Okay, guys, let's fly
this thing out of here.

538
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:44,307
To where?
We would never

539
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,176
get it far enough away.

540
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,844
Maybe the Waverider can.

541
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,646
Rip, we need...

542
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,148
Rip?

543
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,451
Rip!
What are you doing?

544
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:05,221
I'm flying the Waverider
into the sun,

545
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,365
- with the meteor on board.
- <i>And you on it.</i>

546
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,972
I guess this is good-bye.

547
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:20,510
It's been a pleasure,
Captain.

548
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:22,245
Likewise, Dr. Palmer.

549
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:23,980
<i>But you brought us
all into this, man.</i>

550
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:26,750
Which is why I'm doing this
alone, Mr. Jackson.

551
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:29,319
I'll have no one else
die for my choices.

552
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,988
This isn't going
to bring Snart back.

553
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,891
I don't want to lose
another friend.

554
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,427
I appreciate that,
Mr. Rory.

555
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:42,766
<i>I must say, it's been an honor
to serve as your cap...</i>

556
00:32:19,303 --> 00:32:20,637
Rip.

557
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:25,976
Daddy?

558
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,895
Miranda.

559
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:38,014
I...

560
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,382
Where...

561
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,852
<i>I'm still here, Captain.</i>

562
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,387
I know you are, Gideon.

563
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,023
<i>May I share something
with you?</i>

564
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,992
<i>I'm not ready to die.</i>

565
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,763
Me neither.

566
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,198
Which reminds me...

567
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,833
Is our solar ray
still functional?

568
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,335
<i>In fact, it's operating</i>

569
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:01,104
<i>at an efficiency rate
of 12,000%.</i>

570
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:04,241
Transfer all available power
to the time drive.

571
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:05,875
Get ready
to eject the meteor,

572
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,878
and pray that we have enough
power for one

573
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,880
last jump.

574
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:15,585
What happens if only one of
these goes off?

575
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,021
Our time
will remain intact.

576
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:21,391
The world, not so much.

577
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,593
Okay, guys, let's fly
this thing out of here.

578
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:26,324
To where?
We'd never get it far enough away.

579
00:34:26,335 --> 00:34:28,265
Maybe the Waverider can.

580
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:30,167
Rip, we need...
where's Rip?

581
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,800
And the meteorite?

582
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,044
Will somebody please tell me
what just happened?

583
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,114
Rip?

584
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:46,750
Sorry if I gave you all
a fright.

585
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,218
What happened
to the meteor?

586
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,754
Uh, I flew it into
the heart of the sun.

587
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,790
Well, I angled the ship
to eject the meteorite

588
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,892
before impact,
and then, uh...

589
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:57,494
Time jumped away.

590
00:34:57,496 --> 00:34:59,729
- You could have been killed.
- Should have been.

591
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:02,132
You're a moron.

592
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:05,802
Now, who fancies
a return trip to 2016?

593
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:12,909
- I can't believe it's over.
- Well, for some of you, yes.

594
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:16,846
My journey, it seems,
is only just beginning.

595
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:20,116
How does that work?
Savage is three times dead.

596
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,285
The Time Masters are no longer
of growing concern,

597
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,654
due to our destruction
of the Oculus.

598
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:27,791
Someone needs to be responsible
for protecting the timeline.

599
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,959
Who better than
a former Time Master?

600
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,430
And any of you
who'd like to join me.

601
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:57,854
I should stay
and help you with Darhk.

602
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:01,991
And get justice for Laurel.

603
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,360
That's happening, honey,
with or with out you.

604
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,895
I promise.

605
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,163
Uh, listen,
I-i can't pretend

606
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,832
to understand this
time travel thing,

607
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:13,369
but it sounds important.

608
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,872
So is family.

609
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:30,787
I wasn't going to go
the first time.

610
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:33,556
Then Laurel convinced me.

611
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:41,397
And now I'm going
to do this for her.

612
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,735
Well, she'd be proud of you.

613
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:47,537
How do you know?

614
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,539
'Cause I am.

615
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:56,912
What German lone word
literally means

616
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,908
- "the desire to hike"?
- Wanderlust.

617
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,618
A word which could
also be used

618
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,821
to describe that look
in your eye.

619
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:07,323
- What look in my eye?
- Martin, we've been married

620
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,258
for 28 years,
and you're still

621
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,793
a lousy liar.

622
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,829
Now about
this new sabbatical.

623
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:17,331
I decided to decline
the invitation.

624
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:20,835
But... I think you should.

625
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,669
I-I think... I think
it's important...

626
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:23,934
Clarissa,
I'm not leaving you.

627
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:26,242
That's final.

628
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,178
- Hey, Gray.
- What are you...

629
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,180
I'm so glad
that you could make it, Jax.

630
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,448
What are you up to?

631
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,350
Well,
we had a nice, long talk

632
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,812
- this afternoon, didn't we?
- Yeah.

633
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,355
Oh, my god,
this is an intervention!

634
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,658
Yeah, you could
kind of call it that.

635
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,626
Listen, Gray,
you're meant for more

636
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:47,463
than sitting around answering
trivia questions about history.

637
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:50,366
Me, you, Firestorm.

638
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,702
We're made for
changing history.

639
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:55,004
- This is my life.
- And your life

640
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:58,274
will be waiting for you
when you get back.

641
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,942
You really want me
to do this?

642
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:03,846
I could never forgive myself
if I kept you from it,

643
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,849
my husband the superhero.

644
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:38,715
Why are you
looking at me like that?

645
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:40,249
Wasn't sure you'd make it.

646
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,685
You left me a message,
I came.

647
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,087
What of it?

648
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:47,657
I just wanted to talk.

649
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:53,663
You and I,
we've done a lot of thieving,

650
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,765
a lot of cool stuff,
a lot of fun.

651
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:01,070
Anyway, I, uh...

652
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,105
I just wanted to make sure

653
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:03,372
I said something important

654
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:07,376
that wasn't left unsaid.

655
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:10,413
Mick, I don't do
touchy-feely.

656
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:14,250
If you got something to say,
say it.

657
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:17,420
This wasn't a good idea.

658
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,895
You're the best guy
I ever knew.

659
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:27,130
You may not think
you're a hero,

660
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:31,267
but you're a hero to me.

661
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,440
You got that?

662
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:40,610
Yeah, I got it.

663
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:42,812
See you around.

664
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:00,163
You okay?

665
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:01,731
Fine.

666
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,900
- So did you tell him?
- That he killed himself

667
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,501
to save our destinies?

668
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:07,303
If it's any consolation,

669
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:08,504
I can always bring you back

670
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,274
to this particular time
and place.

671
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:15,478
I'm fine.
Just let it be.

672
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,459
A full compliment.

673
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:31,861
To be honest,
I had my doubts

674
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,129
that all of you
would be willing

675
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:35,464
to throw in with me
for a second go.

676
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:39,468
- Well, actually...
- we're not coming with you.

677
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,371
With Savage gone,
we want to start fresh,

678
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,472
see what happens.

679
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,642
I give it three months, tops.

680
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:49,344
Look, I just...

681
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:53,947
I want to say thank you.
To all of you.

682
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,212
- Ray, I...
- No.

683
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:58,688
This is...
it's meant to be.

684
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:01,891
I wish both of you
nothing but the best.

685
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:11,901
Be safe.

686
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:14,670
See you guys around.

687
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,181
Every time they do that,

688
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:28,818
I get hungry for chicken.

689
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,320
So, shall we?

690
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,462
- Is that...
- The Waverider.

691
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:42,465
Another Waverider?

692
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:46,068
Whatever it is,
it's not slowing down.

693
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,338
Get down!

694
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:54,577
What the hell's going on?

695
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:58,347
To be honest, Mr. Jackson,
I have absolutely no idea.

696
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,424
Is this 2016?

697
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:11,594
Is this may, 2016?

698
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:13,229
Yeah.

699
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:16,899
You're exactly where
you said you'd be.

700
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:21,103
Do not get on that ship.

701
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:24,240
If you do, you're all dead.

702
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:25,608
Says who?

703
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,877
Says you, Mr. Rory.

704
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,679
You sent me.

705
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:31,814
I'm sorry.

706
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:33,816
Who exactly are you?

707
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,388
My name is Rex Tyler.

708
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,890
I'm a member of the
Justice Society of America.

709
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:13,789
Greg, move your head.
