1
00:01:44,418 --> 00:01:47,854
<i>I wrote it all down:</i>
<i>4,200 square feet, four floors. Perfect.</i>

2
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:50,651
Courtyard in back,
south-facing garden. Perfect.

3
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:54,251
-Shouldn't we wait for the car service?
-No, we'll sit in traffic forever.

4
00:01:54,327 --> 00:01:56,795
-ls that the listing sheet?
-There isn't one.

5
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:59,622
l heard about it this morning.
lt'll be gone soon.

6
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:02,793
-How many more?
-None. You know the market is tight.

7
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:06,865
-Sarah, do you have to ride that here?
-Mom, we're in the street.

8
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:09,731
Evan!

9
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:16,073
One day you will learn
to respect people's time, Lydia.

10
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:20,719
You'll realize that the world does not stop
and start at your convenience.

11
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:22,081
l'm so sorry.

12
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:25,052
l'm meeting Arthur Digby Laurence
in 26 minutes...

13
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:28,752
...and if you think he's the kind of man
who tolerates tardiness...

14
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,729
...you are sadly mistaken.

15
00:02:30,897 --> 00:02:33,331
You're a saint to wait for us.

16
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:35,262
-Thank you.
-Hello.

17
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:41,431
lt's kind of between a townhouse
and a brownstone.

18
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:44,009
We call it a ''townstone.''

19
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:48,840
Built in 1879, this is the middle
of the house, the parlor floor.

20
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:53,110
Here is the living room.
Formal dining is in the back.

21
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:55,913
Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...

22
00:02:56,089 --> 00:03:00,025
...which was renovated in '94
with all the expected amenities.

23
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:01,555
Sarah.

24
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:05,526
There are two bedroom floors above.

25
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,469
My God, it's amazing.

26
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:11,868
Hey, kid. No scooter.

27
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:17,469
l don't have to tell you this amount
of living space is uncommon in Manhattan.

28
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:22,907
lt's got a yard. Sort of.

29
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:26,550
lt is in a bit of disarray, but then again,
21-foot lot, 53 deep.

30
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:29,583
lt allows for an expansive garden.

31
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,755
Working elevator.

32
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:36,059
The previous owner was disabled
the last years of his life.

33
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:37,787
Highly unusual, the elevator.

34
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:40,264
You will not find this
in 90 percent of brownstones.

35
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:44,599
Perhaps it's something of a fixer-upper,
but we anticipate enormous interest.

36
00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:47,934
lt's a very emotional property.

37
00:03:48,174 --> 00:03:50,506
Shall we have a look at the rest?

38
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:56,579
You should make an offer immediately.

39
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:58,080
Can l see it first?

40
00:03:58,251 --> 00:04:01,709
There is nothing like this
on the market right now.

41
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:04,279
You can't move from Greenwich
to the Upper West Side...

42
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:08,259
...and expect to still have a house, a yard
and a dog and cat, but here it is.

43
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:11,058
lt's got everything
you told me you wanted and more.

44
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:14,324
You'll have another family.
You could have two.

45
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:15,692
lt's a fortune.

46
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:19,034
Mom, it's not Barneys.
You don't have to pay the price on the tag.

47
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:26,238
He can afford it.

48
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:31,410
lt would be so lovely
if l could show the property before l leave.

49
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,053
Hardwood floors throughout,
as many as six working fireplaces.

50
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:44,628
This is the top floor. Two bedrooms.
One at either end.

51
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:46,689
They share one small bath.

52
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:49,530
Originally, this would have been
the servants' quarters.

53
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:52,231
The previous owner
kept a small nursing staff.

54
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,703
l don't know if you have live-in help.

55
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:57,572
No, it's just the two of us.

56
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:04,377
Third floor, spare bedroom, den,
or what have you.

57
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:06,984
Mr. Pearlstine used this as an office.

58
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:11,146
He's talking about Sidney Pearlstine,
the financier.

59
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:13,985
May l ask what you do, Mrs<i>....</i>

60
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:15,855
Altman.

61
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:18,520
Actually, l'm going back to school.
Columbia.

62
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:21,633
Her husband's in pharmaceuticals.

63
00:05:21,835 --> 00:05:25,498
l didn't realize
you were Stephan Altman's wife.

64
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:28,367
Yes, until recently.

65
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:30,836
Master bath.

66
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,371
Pearlstine's been in all the papers
since he died.

67
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:39,040
His kids are suing each other
over the estate.

68
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:41,153
He was a recluse. Rich, paranoid.

69
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:43,416
Now they can't find half his money.

70
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,391
l hardly see how gossip
is germane to showing the property.

71
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,792
Stop calling it ''the property.''
lt sounds ridiculous.

72
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:52,164
Walk-in closet.

73
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:58,397
Could the little one please stop that?

74
00:05:58,571 --> 00:06:01,096
Kid, no elevator!

75
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:05,000
And we emerge in the master suite.

76
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,717
That's strange.

77
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:15,947
What?

78
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:24,556
ls this room smaller than it should be?

79
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:26,724
You're the first person to notice.

80
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:31,494
On caravan, no one from our office
had the slightest idea.

81
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:45,347
lt's called a panic room.

82
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:47,181
-What?
-A safe room.

83
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:50,413
-A castle keep in medieval times.
-l've read about these.

84
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:52,752
They're in vogue in high-end construction.

85
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:55,460
One can't be too careful
about home invasion.

86
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:56,927
This is perfect.

87
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:59,294
The alarm goes off
in the middle of the night.

88
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:02,391
What will you do?
Call the police and wait till Tuesday?

89
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:06,132
Traipse downstairs in your underthings
to check it out? l think not.

90
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:10,302
Concrete walls. Buried phone line,
not connected to the house's main line.

91
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:14,142
Call the police, nobody can cut you off.
You have your own ventilation system.

92
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:18,446
A bank of surveillance monitors that covers
nearly every corner of the house.

93
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:20,749
This whole thing makes me nervous.

94
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,151
Why?

95
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:24,087
Ever read any Poe?

96
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:26,421
No, but l loved her last album.

97
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:30,919
What's to keep somebody
from prying open the door?

98
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:32,157
Steel.

99
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:34,858
Thick steel. Very thick steel.

100
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,526
Full battery backup,
so even if the power's out...

101
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:39,231
...it's still functional.

102
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:44,236
Oh, my god.
Old Sidney didn't miss a trick, did he?

103
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:45,470
Open it, please.

104
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:49,140
And with kids like he's apparently got,
no wonder he wanted a place to hide.

105
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:50,443
Please open the door.

106
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:52,075
That is highly inappropriate.

107
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:54,120
Open the door, please.

108
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:02,055
My room. Definitely my room.

109
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:03,789
This is really dangerous.

110
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,261
-That door is a hazard.
-Not at all.

111
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:12,764
Motion detector, like an elevator.

112
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,502
The door won't close if it's blocked.
There's another one at your ankles.

113
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:18,739
lt couldn't be safer.

114
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,356
l know they'll take asking price.

115
00:08:53,012 --> 00:08:55,947
lt's working. l hooked up the phone!

116
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:58,982
Good for you, Mom. Hooked up a phone.

117
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:00,812
579 what?

118
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:02,985
3000.

119
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:10,461
<i>Patsy's Pizza. Please hold.</i>

120
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:17,937
Hey. Enough.

121
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:27,677
Mind the pizza?

122
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:29,176
What do you mean?

123
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:33,651
Our first night.
l should've thought of something special.

124
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:35,218
l like pizza.

125
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:52,499
Fuck him.

126
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:56,069
Don't.

127
00:09:57,677 --> 00:09:59,338
Fuck her, too.

128
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,312
l agree.

129
00:10:02,682 --> 00:10:04,081
But don't.

130
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:27,035
Don't you think this place
has way too many stairs?

131
00:10:27,173 --> 00:10:28,970
You didn't carry anything up them.

132
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:31,533
You never asked
what l thought of this house.

133
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:33,772
l didn't want you to tell me you hated it.

134
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:37,179
-l liked our old house.
-Well, so did l.

135
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:39,642
You know what l was thinking?

136
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:43,382
l was thinking we could
stencil the whole bookcase.

137
00:10:43,556 --> 00:10:46,354
We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves.

138
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,354
Go ahead.

139
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,860
Oh, damn.

140
00:10:56,302 --> 00:10:59,169
l forgot to set up that tour
of your new school.

141
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:02,603
Dad already did it.
l'm going with him on Sunday.

142
00:11:03,142 --> 00:11:04,131
Oh, yeah?

143
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,671
So l'll take a cab and meet him there.

144
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:10,847
ls that what he said?

145
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:13,747
lsn't that what's so great
about Manhattan?

146
00:11:13,987 --> 00:11:15,955
You don't have to drive me everywhere?

147
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:18,448
l'll ride with you.

148
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:21,790
Why'd you bring me here
if l can't go anywhere on my own?

149
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:23,453
That's it. l quit.

150
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:27,397
l'm not fighting with you till tomorrow.

151
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:29,457
Come here.

152
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,095
lt's disgusting how much l love you.

153
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:34,864
Tell me about it.

154
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:43,349
-Mom?
-Yeah.

155
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:45,883
lt's too dark.

156
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:03,195
Better?

157
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,135
That's better.

158
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:36,050
''Bypass non-ready zone.''

159
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,854
''Bypass non-ready zone.''

160
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,660
''Shunt. Enter.''

161
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:59,740
''Bypass non-ready zone.''

162
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:01,412
''Shunt.''

163
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:04,548
''Enter zone number.''

164
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:08,016
''Shunt again.''

165
00:15:13,693 --> 00:15:17,220
ln the morning l got to figure out
how to turn this thing off.

166
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,836
Go, go back.

167
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:40,142
Do it.

168
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:18,790
Come on. Come on. Jesus fucking Christ.

169
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:20,562
Amateur.

170
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:28,705
We got a problem! We need to talk!

171
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:31,436
lt's about time. l'm freezing
my tits off out there.

172
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:38,315
-Who is that?
-This is Raoul.

173
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:39,882
Who the fuck is Raoul?

174
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,815
Raoul is okay. Raoul has experience.

175
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:45,286
-Where'd you get him?
-Through some people.

176
00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:47,018
Open the fucking door.

177
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:52,630
No shit.

178
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,696
What is this?

179
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:02,172
There's a girl on the top floor,
a woman on the third. They're asleep.

180
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:03,674
They're not supposed to be here.

181
00:21:03,742 --> 00:21:07,007
-This is your department, Junior!
-They are not supposed to be here!

182
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:09,070
Videotape. We're on videotape.

183
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:13,140
We've been on videotape since we got here
and the tapes are upstairs.

184
00:21:13,218 --> 00:21:14,776
-14-day escrow.
-You fucked me!

185
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:18,914
14-day escrow! That's almost 3 weeks!
They should not be in for another week!

186
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:23,560
Exactly how is 14 days three weeks?

187
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:26,462
Business days.
Escrow is always business days.

188
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:28,295
Five-day weeks always!

189
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:34,002
Right?

190
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:36,438
l'm out of here.

191
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:39,436
Just wait a minute. Wait a minute!

192
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:42,773
We can handle this.
Can we still handle this?

193
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:45,073
lt's just a woman and a kid?

194
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,414
-Unless Daddy comes home.
-He's not.

195
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:51,445
They're divorcing. Daddy's banging some
B model on the Upper East Side.

196
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:53,318
lt's just her and the kid!

197
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:55,353
Now, can we do this?

198
00:21:57,329 --> 00:21:58,557
Yeah, we can do it.

199
00:21:58,998 --> 00:22:01,660
Not with people here. And not with me.

200
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:09,130
-Wait! Twenty minutes!
-She'll call the police.

201
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,142
They'll be here before l unpack my bags.

202
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,270
So, we keep an eye on her.

203
00:22:14,847 --> 00:22:18,010
Raoul can totally administrate that part.

204
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,118
l don't want Raoul to administrate that!
He's not even supposed to be here!

205
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:26,982
Nobody gets hurt.

206
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:30,792
What about us? What if she has a gun?

207
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:35,126
Who are you?

208
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:37,832
l'm Raoul.

209
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:54,309
You know we can't do this without you!

210
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,215
This is still a good plan.

211
00:22:56,388 --> 00:23:00,552
Fuck that! This is a great plan.
lt's just got a slight twist.

212
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:01,923
Yeah.

213
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:04,128
Felony kidnapping. Thirty years.

214
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:09,096
You make a lot of promises, don't you?
You promise me, you promise your kids.

215
00:23:10,102 --> 00:23:11,160
No family.

216
00:23:12,337 --> 00:23:16,000
You're right. lt's all fucked up.
l fucked it up!

217
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:18,175
lt's not how it's supposed to be.

218
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:26,747
But the fact of the matter is
there's still $3,000,000 in this house...

219
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:30,983
...and no one but you and l
even knows it's here.

220
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:35,183
Hey, l want that money. l want it!

221
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:36,893
But you...

222
00:23:38,363 --> 00:23:40,354
...you need that money.

223
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,363
Or have you forgotten why you're here?

224
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:51,541
So let's quit dicking around, okay,
and get this over with.

225
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,715
Kill the phones.

226
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:43,104
Top floor, little girl. l've got the mother.
Give me that!

227
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:46,843
You stay here! Nobody gets past!

228
00:26:57,796 --> 00:26:59,058
Wake up! Sarah!

229
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:01,733
Get up!

230
00:27:07,906 --> 00:27:09,635
What did you do that for?

231
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:18,982
Where are you going?

232
00:27:28,794 --> 00:27:31,558
-What's going on?
-People. ln the house.

233
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:36,495
They're in the elevator, heading down.

234
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:56,844
Fuck! They're coming down to you!

235
00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:59,446
l told you. l don't hurt people.

236
00:28:02,227 --> 00:28:03,819
They're going downstairs.

237
00:28:06,264 --> 00:28:07,458
-That room.
-What?

238
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:09,056
The panic room.

239
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:11,735
No, press emergency stop.

240
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:17,401
Fuck!

241
00:28:20,912 --> 00:28:22,402
Coming back up!

242
00:28:33,992 --> 00:28:35,016
That's you.

243
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:39,330
Shit.

244
00:28:47,672 --> 00:28:48,900
Go!

245
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:51,207
Fuck!

246
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:54,837
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

247
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:57,872
Damn it! Mother--

248
00:29:00,585 --> 00:29:01,813
Shit!

249
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:15,128
That's seven years bad luck.

250
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:18,431
Shit.

251
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:35,085
Tell me they're not in there.

252
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:56,204
Oh, damn.

253
00:29:57,075 --> 00:29:59,873
-lt doesn't work?
-lt's a different phone line.

254
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:02,837
l never hooked it up.

255
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:09,013
Now what?

256
00:30:35,814 --> 00:30:37,475
l can't hear a thing.

257
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,181
What do you think they want?

258
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:42,149
l don't know. Rob us<i>....</i>

259
00:30:44,923 --> 00:30:46,390
l don't know.

260
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:48,058
What do we do?

261
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,318
We wait.

262
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:53,228
-What if they get in here?
-Well, they can't.

263
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,093
They can't get in. lt's not possible.

264
00:30:57,169 --> 00:30:58,830
Mom. l heard you.

265
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:04,937
-Do you feel okay?
-Yeah.

266
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,477
-You shaky?
-No.

267
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:08,035
-Chills?
-No.

268
00:31:11,082 --> 00:31:13,812
Please. Don't worry about me.

269
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:33,767
He's got kids. What do you think he'll do?

270
00:31:33,838 --> 00:31:36,705
Hang out while the cops waltz in?
Use your head.

271
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:38,102
Here he comes.

272
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:41,202
l locked the roof access.
She's not getting down from there.

273
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,248
-Good.
-She could be in there calling the cops.

274
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:46,511
Could she have hooked it up today?

275
00:31:46,585 --> 00:31:48,746
No. You don't just call up Bell Atlantic.

276
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,948
She would've had to do it through
Manhattan Security, my company.

277
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:54,685
l checked the paperwork
and the phone is not connected.

278
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,852
You see? She couldn't have.

279
00:31:57,596 --> 00:32:00,861
-l thought she wouldn't be here.
-He said she wouldn't.

280
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:03,867
Fuck you! And fuck you!
She is not supposed--

281
00:32:09,441 --> 00:32:10,601
Do it.

282
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:15,203
<i>Excuse me.</i>

283
00:32:17,315 --> 00:32:19,545
<i>The police are on their way.</i>

284
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,290
-She's lying.
-You're full of--

285
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,491
lt's not an intercom. lt's a PA system.

286
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:40,299
l know. l'm just scaring her.

287
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:42,837
<i>I suggest you leave before they get here.</i>

288
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:50,507
-What?
-He's saying that we don't have a phone.

289
00:32:50,582 --> 00:32:52,049
How could he know that?

290
00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:55,745
<i>Take what you want and get out!</i>

291
00:32:56,821 --> 00:32:58,789
lf only it were that easy.

292
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:04,118
Some paper. l need some paper.
Give me some paper.

293
00:33:04,195 --> 00:33:06,288
Hey, Zorro! You going to help us out?

294
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:07,922
You got a piece of paper?

295
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,764
-What is he doing?
-l don't know.

296
00:33:27,018 --> 00:33:29,350
''What we want is in that room''?

297
00:33:29,554 --> 00:33:31,579
They're coming in here, aren't they?

298
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:34,216
No, no. l told you. They can't get in here.

299
00:33:35,727 --> 00:33:37,661
<i>What do you know about this room?</i>

300
00:33:37,729 --> 00:33:39,492
What do we know about that room?

301
00:33:39,564 --> 00:33:41,964
-Let's not tell her anything.
-Just a few details.

302
00:33:57,549 --> 00:34:00,416
We're not coming out,
and we're not letting you in!

303
00:34:00,552 --> 00:34:02,452
<i>Get out of my house!</i>

304
00:34:02,921 --> 00:34:04,855
-Say ''fuck.''
-You fuck.

305
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:09,786
-Mom.
-What?

306
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:11,829
''Get the fuck out of my house.''

307
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,121
<i>Get the fuck out of my house!</i>

308
00:34:20,472 --> 00:34:22,099
Okay, l have an idea.

309
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:25,032
She's a woman. Women need security.

310
00:34:29,514 --> 00:34:31,072
She won't believe you.

311
00:34:31,316 --> 00:34:36,117
She needs to know she's dealing
with decent people and she can trust us.

312
00:34:43,228 --> 00:34:44,889
<i>Conversation's over!</i>

313
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:50,466
What? She's not coming down?

314
00:34:50,635 --> 00:34:54,036
Shut up.
Will you please shut up and let me think?

315
00:34:54,672 --> 00:34:56,299
Like that'll help you think.

316
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:58,774
You know what? Fine! You think!

317
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:01,004
-What if she did call the cops?
-She didn't.

318
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:03,240
She said it again, that she called the cops.

319
00:35:03,314 --> 00:35:05,805
lf cops were coming,
do you think l'd still be here?

320
00:35:05,884 --> 00:35:08,682
Okay, fine. Good, excellent.
We all believe you.

321
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,085
How do we get into that room?

322
00:35:17,562 --> 00:35:19,462
What is funny about this?

323
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:22,198
ls this shit funny to you?

324
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:25,602
l spent the last 12 years
building these rooms...

325
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,963
...to keep out people like us.

326
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:32,908
lt's all so ironic and amusing, okay?
Now, how do we get in?

327
00:35:34,512 --> 00:35:35,740
We can't.

328
00:35:36,748 --> 00:35:38,511
You can't get in the panic room.

329
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:42,280
That's the whole point.
We have to get her to come out.

330
00:35:42,821 --> 00:35:44,550
And why would she do that?

331
00:35:45,356 --> 00:35:46,721
l don't know.

332
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:50,892
But when she does,
she can't get out of this house.

333
00:35:51,963 --> 00:35:55,330
We keep her here,
we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...

334
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:58,559
...and l don't want any help
from Joe Pesci over here.

335
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,932
They want to hole up in this house? Fine.

336
00:36:02,207 --> 00:36:04,539
We make it impossible for them to leave.

337
00:36:07,312 --> 00:36:10,110
And why would they come out
in the first place?

338
00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:14,180
l'm working on that.

339
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,558
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

340
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,066
Small space?

341
00:36:29,734 --> 00:36:31,065
l'm okay.

342
00:36:32,604 --> 00:36:34,094
-You can't wig out.
-l know.

343
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:35,935
-l mean it.
-l won't.

344
00:36:38,776 --> 00:36:41,904
You know,
people never get buried alive anymore.

345
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:45,981
l guess it used to happen all the time.

346
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:48,282
Really?

347
00:36:48,486 --> 00:36:49,976
Yeah, l read that.

348
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:53,489
And when did this happen all the time?

349
00:36:55,927 --> 00:36:58,122
Twenty, thirty years ago.

350
00:37:01,165 --> 00:37:03,065
What are they doing now?

351
00:37:09,474 --> 00:37:11,101
l don't know.

352
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:13,397
They're locking us in.

353
00:38:52,677 --> 00:38:54,542
This is not happening.

354
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:06,613
Sarah, calm down.

355
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:12,093
You know what could happen
if you let yourself get worked up.

356
00:39:13,264 --> 00:39:14,561
Sarah!

357
00:39:44,295 --> 00:39:47,560
-What the hell are you doing?
-We're coming in from below.

358
00:39:47,765 --> 00:39:51,166
No, you're not. Even if you got through
the concrete, there's steel.

359
00:39:51,235 --> 00:39:53,032
You won't even make a dent.

360
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:55,169
We'll see.

361
00:39:56,507 --> 00:39:58,702
Hey. This is what l do.

362
00:39:58,943 --> 00:40:01,810
lf some idiot with a sledgehammer
could break in...

363
00:40:02,046 --> 00:40:05,038
...do you really think
that l would still have a job?

364
00:40:13,925 --> 00:40:15,756
Don't get that in your eye.

365
00:40:50,128 --> 00:40:51,425
Neighbor.

366
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:52,857
Help!

367
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:55,295
Please help us!

368
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,892
-Call the police!
-Do you hear us?

369
00:40:58,269 --> 00:40:59,361
Help us!

370
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:12,277
Help!

371
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:15,442
-Help us, please!
-Call the police!

372
00:41:59,363 --> 00:42:00,728
Shit!

373
00:42:27,825 --> 00:42:29,986
You guys just going to stand there?

374
00:42:30,461 --> 00:42:32,793
Why? What do you got, MacGyver?

375
00:43:07,665 --> 00:43:10,259
He can't get in here with a hammer,
can he?

376
00:43:16,674 --> 00:43:18,938
Could you be any louder?

377
00:43:29,253 --> 00:43:31,278
Give me a hand with those boxes.

378
00:43:33,457 --> 00:43:34,947
Listen, goddamn it!

379
00:43:35,293 --> 00:43:38,626
l'm in charge here.
Now, what the hell is going on?

380
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:47,938
-They're going to get in here.
-No, they can't get in here.

381
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:54,307
We're going to be fine. We'll be just fine.

382
00:45:00,578 --> 00:45:02,011
Oh, this is good.

383
00:45:03,748 --> 00:45:05,147
This could work.

384
00:45:05,383 --> 00:45:08,614
l was just thinking
that we should do something like this.

385
00:45:12,723 --> 00:45:15,658
-Open it.
-l just did.

386
00:45:15,726 --> 00:45:17,626
Open it some more.

387
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,628
We're just sending them a message.

388
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,392
They'll get the point.

389
00:46:02,206 --> 00:46:04,071
Honey, get down on the ground.

390
00:46:12,683 --> 00:46:16,050
Quit dicking around
and open this fucking thing up.

391
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,281
-Don't be stupid.
-Quiet!

392
00:46:18,355 --> 00:46:20,983
We're trying to scare them, not kill them.

393
00:46:28,032 --> 00:46:29,522
What is it?

394
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:31,259
lt's bad.

395
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:34,894
They're coughing.

396
00:46:35,206 --> 00:46:37,504
lf they're coughing, they're going to die!

397
00:46:37,575 --> 00:46:39,236
Nobody is going to die, man!

398
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,677
Will you please have the balls
to follow through with something?

399
00:46:57,928 --> 00:46:59,156
Mom.

400
00:47:03,534 --> 00:47:07,095
The worst that'll happen is they'll pass out.
They'll have a hangover.

401
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:10,402
How are we going to get in there
if they pass out, Junior?

402
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:14,272
Cut it back a little.

403
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:17,371
They won't pass out, numb-nuts.
They'll throw up first.

404
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:19,540
We can't get in if they're dead!

405
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:24,110
Stay on the ground and breathe.

406
00:47:30,895 --> 00:47:32,419
Turn it down.

407
00:47:33,097 --> 00:47:34,655
Turn it down! lt's too much!

408
00:47:34,732 --> 00:47:37,292
-Don't you start up with this shit.
-Keep it down!

409
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:49,641
l'm turning it down.

410
00:47:49,713 --> 00:47:52,238
-Keep his ass off of me.
-We're not killing anybody.

411
00:48:03,494 --> 00:48:05,826
-Tell him to turn it down!
-Turn the shit off.

412
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:08,193
-No.
-Turn it down.

413
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:21,901
-Mom?
-Just a second.

414
00:48:26,383 --> 00:48:27,645
Get under this.

415
00:48:29,353 --> 00:48:30,479
Oh, my god.

416
00:48:30,688 --> 00:48:33,418
-Fucking amateurs, man!
-lt's my fucking idea.

417
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:46,903
Shut the fuck up!
There are people trying to sleep over there.

418
00:49:11,495 --> 00:49:12,826
What is that?

419
00:49:14,365 --> 00:49:15,832
Turn the gas off.

420
00:49:24,975 --> 00:49:26,875
Turn the gas off right now.

421
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:51,866
Get back!

422
00:49:52,436 --> 00:49:53,664
Shit!

423
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,905
God!

424
00:49:57,975 --> 00:49:59,340
Get it off me!

425
00:50:05,716 --> 00:50:06,944
lt's okay.

426
00:50:09,586 --> 00:50:14,285
You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!
l'm coming in there!

427
00:50:15,326 --> 00:50:17,521
Calm the fuck down.

428
00:50:27,638 --> 00:50:29,629
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

429
00:50:31,141 --> 00:50:35,669
Promise me you'll never do
anything like that.

430
00:50:36,613 --> 00:50:37,875
l won't.

431
00:50:40,751 --> 00:50:44,243
They're moving.
At least they're still moving in there.

432
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,692
What?

433
00:50:58,335 --> 00:50:59,700
Talk to him.

434
00:51:02,706 --> 00:51:05,140
Please, man, give it a rest.

435
00:52:06,336 --> 00:52:08,566
-That Morse code?
-SOS.

436
00:52:08,806 --> 00:52:10,433
Where'd you learn that?

437
00:52:10,607 --> 00:52:11,972
<i>Titanic.</i>

438
00:52:23,287 --> 00:52:25,448
We got to talk. Downstairs.

439
00:52:31,528 --> 00:52:33,928
No, no, no. Not you.

440
00:52:40,404 --> 00:52:43,896
Come on, come on, come on.

441
00:52:45,209 --> 00:52:46,506
Get up.

442
00:52:47,611 --> 00:52:48,942
Come on.

443
00:52:58,088 --> 00:52:59,453
Wake up.

444
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:08,797
The first thing l'm going to do this morning
is call my plastic surgeon.

445
00:53:08,866 --> 00:53:13,894
There's been a change here.
$100,000 is not enough. Not for this shit.

446
00:53:15,138 --> 00:53:18,130
l want a third
of whatever's in that room up there.

447
00:53:22,279 --> 00:53:23,268
Fine!

448
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:27,714
Okay? Full share, one-third.
Congratulations.

449
00:53:28,285 --> 00:53:32,517
You bought a ski mask, made $1,000,000.
Your parents will be proud.

450
00:53:54,845 --> 00:53:56,142
Got him.

451
00:53:56,613 --> 00:54:00,606
Let me straighten out something else.
Get control of your goddamn expert.

452
00:54:00,817 --> 00:54:03,217
l'm not losing
my half of the money because--

453
00:54:03,287 --> 00:54:04,777
Slow down. Half?

454
00:54:04,855 --> 00:54:08,347
Did you sleep through grade school?
Five seconds ago, it was a third<i>....</i>

455
00:54:09,192 --> 00:54:10,523
Come on.

456
00:54:15,632 --> 00:54:17,896
l'm letting you know he's a problem.

457
00:54:18,101 --> 00:54:20,899
But this wasn't my idea,
so he's your problem.

458
00:54:21,004 --> 00:54:23,302
You're right. lt wasn't your idea!

459
00:54:23,373 --> 00:54:25,534
None of this was your idea!
lt was my idea!

460
00:54:29,012 --> 00:54:30,809
Come on, look over here.

461
00:54:43,293 --> 00:54:44,487
Yes.

462
00:54:45,295 --> 00:54:46,626
Yes, yes, yes.

463
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,566
Let's hope this guy's an ex-Boy Scout.

464
00:54:58,809 --> 00:55:00,572
-We're here!
-Help us!

465
00:55:00,644 --> 00:55:02,475
We're over here!

466
00:55:12,889 --> 00:55:14,186
Help!

467
00:55:14,257 --> 00:55:16,487
Open your window!

468
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,891
Help!

469
00:55:26,403 --> 00:55:28,735
We're never going to get out of here.

470
00:55:37,147 --> 00:55:40,480
l'm the loving grandson who put in
the time with the old man...

471
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:42,984
...every goddamn weekend for two years...

472
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,180
...talking to him, dressing him,
walking him, feeding him.

473
00:55:46,256 --> 00:55:47,723
Are you done?

474
00:55:47,824 --> 00:55:51,123
No. l'm the one the old man
finally told about the safe.

475
00:55:51,194 --> 00:55:55,096
l'm the one who found the guy who built it,
and l convinced him to break into it!

476
00:55:58,769 --> 00:56:00,066
Wait a minute.

477
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,439
-What?
-The bedroom's empty. Where are they?

478
00:56:08,612 --> 00:56:10,409
Two of them, on the stairs.

479
00:56:11,148 --> 00:56:12,740
Where's the third guy?

480
00:56:16,753 --> 00:56:18,778
l left my cell phone by the bed.

481
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,818
l earned that money.

482
00:56:25,128 --> 00:56:27,619
l will not let you jeopardize
my fucking plan...

483
00:56:27,698 --> 00:56:30,997
...because you have a problem
relating to others!

484
00:56:32,569 --> 00:56:33,831
Got it?

485
00:56:35,172 --> 00:56:37,333
lf l don't come back, close this door.

486
00:56:37,407 --> 00:56:39,238
Just do what l say.

487
00:56:41,545 --> 00:56:43,479
He touches me again, l'll shoot him.

488
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:44,605
Christ!

489
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:48,278
Wait!

490
00:56:51,722 --> 00:56:55,123
Any other schoolyard bullshit to settle,
or can we get back to work?

491
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:57,550
Don't take no tone with me, jerk-wad.

492
00:56:57,694 --> 00:57:00,595
l'll shove it up your ass and snap it off.

493
00:57:00,664 --> 00:57:04,122
You're a bus driver, Raoul.

494
00:57:04,501 --> 00:57:05,900
You live in Flatbush.

495
00:57:05,969 --> 00:57:08,836
Don't spout some Elmore Leonard
bullshit you just heard...

496
00:57:09,072 --> 00:57:10,903
...because l saw that movie, too.

497
00:57:11,308 --> 00:57:12,297
What is this?

498
00:57:14,544 --> 00:57:16,011
l got some news for you.

499
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:19,680
Go.

500
00:57:19,883 --> 00:57:21,373
Go!

501
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,149
Fuck!

502
00:59:13,196 --> 00:59:15,858
She got something. What did she get?

503
00:59:16,967 --> 00:59:17,956
No.

504
00:59:20,036 --> 00:59:21,264
Charger!

505
00:59:21,972 --> 00:59:24,133
She has a cell phone.

506
00:59:25,642 --> 00:59:26,631
No!

507
00:59:28,545 --> 00:59:29,944
All right, signal.

508
00:59:30,146 --> 00:59:32,842
Come on. Signal.

509
00:59:44,394 --> 00:59:47,830
l don't think they'll be talking
on no cell phone from in there.

510
00:59:48,899 --> 00:59:51,561
-Why not?
-You can't call out from in there.

511
00:59:54,471 --> 00:59:56,029
No signal.

512
01:00:05,582 --> 01:00:08,415
l didn't hook up this line,
but l hooked up the main line.

513
01:00:08,485 --> 01:00:11,045
lf we can find it, we can cut into it.

514
01:00:12,989 --> 01:00:17,824
l can't go to prison, man.
l'm not built for that shit.

515
01:00:29,072 --> 01:00:30,130
Be careful.

516
01:00:41,618 --> 01:00:42,949
Get the phone.

517
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,246
-lt doesn't come off.
-Rip it off!

518
01:00:56,733 --> 01:00:58,928
Screwdriver. Phillips.

519
01:01:06,409 --> 01:01:10,675
Junior, when l asked you to cut
the phone lines, did you cut the main line?

520
01:01:11,014 --> 01:01:14,245
Or did you just cut the cord on the phone
in the kitchen?

521
01:01:40,243 --> 01:01:41,175
Shit!

522
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,341
Strip this and expose the wires.

523
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:48,646
-What are we doing?
-l have no idea.

524
01:02:16,713 --> 01:02:19,375
-Okay, got it?
-Yeah. Here.

525
01:02:19,582 --> 01:02:20,708
Okay.

526
01:02:21,151 --> 01:02:22,778
Yellow, yellow.

527
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:38,122
Okay.

528
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:41,732
Dial tone.

529
01:02:50,747 --> 01:02:52,044
<i>91 1 emergency.</i>

530
01:02:52,282 --> 01:02:54,978
Yes, this is 38 West 94th Street--

531
01:02:55,051 --> 01:02:58,282
<i>-Please hold.</i>
-No, no. God.

532
01:03:03,893 --> 01:03:04,882
Call Dad.

533
01:03:09,966 --> 01:03:13,800
How do you live in New York
and not have a single Percocet?

534
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:19,302
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Stephan. Put Stephan on the line.

535
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:21,275
<i>-Who is this?</i>
-lt's Meg.

536
01:03:22,078 --> 01:03:23,739
<i>Do you know what time it is?</i>

537
01:03:24,147 --> 01:03:27,446
-Put him on the phone, bitch.
<i>-It's your fucking wife.</i>

538
01:03:31,387 --> 01:03:32,376
Move.

539
01:03:34,491 --> 01:03:36,857
<i>-Hello?</i>
-You've got to help us.

540
01:03:36,926 --> 01:03:37,984
Move!

541
01:03:38,161 --> 01:03:41,460
There are three men upstairs.
They broke in--

542
01:03:44,801 --> 01:03:45,790
What--

543
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:02,884
-He'll do something.
-No, he won't.

544
01:04:02,952 --> 01:04:04,510
He'll call the police.

545
01:04:04,721 --> 01:04:06,814
You don't know her. She won't let him.

546
01:04:07,023 --> 01:04:10,424
No. He knows that there's trouble.
He heard me.

547
01:04:11,227 --> 01:04:14,594
He's across the park. That's why
we got houses close to each other.

548
01:04:14,664 --> 01:04:17,155
Just in case we needed each other.
He'll help us.

549
01:04:17,233 --> 01:04:19,531
-He won't.
-Yes, he will!

550
01:04:25,508 --> 01:04:26,805
l'm sorry.

551
01:04:27,377 --> 01:04:29,242
No, l'm sorry.

552
01:04:30,413 --> 01:04:31,402
Why?

553
01:04:32,815 --> 01:04:34,806
l was trying not to tell you.

554
01:04:36,019 --> 01:04:37,008
What?

555
01:04:37,654 --> 01:04:39,622
l'm dizzy and hungry.

556
01:04:42,859 --> 01:04:46,124
All she's got is NyQuil and fucking Midol.

557
01:04:48,598 --> 01:04:51,066
Looks like that gas idea
didn't work so well.

558
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:53,167
Whose fault was that?

559
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:54,666
This is impossible.

560
01:04:54,871 --> 01:04:56,566
What's the plan now, hot rod?

561
01:04:56,639 --> 01:04:59,369
This is worse than impossible.
This is unpleasant.

562
01:05:01,444 --> 01:05:04,242
Here, drink this.
All right, drink lots of water.

563
01:05:04,914 --> 01:05:08,315
You dropped to the low 40s.
We have to get your blood-sugar up.

564
01:05:08,384 --> 01:05:09,908
Can you hear me okay?

565
01:05:09,986 --> 01:05:11,783
l'm just dizzy, not deaf.

566
01:05:12,689 --> 01:05:14,953
Great. Smart ass. That's excellent.

567
01:05:15,024 --> 01:05:19,324
Did you see anything in here?
Any candy bars or something sweet?

568
01:05:19,896 --> 01:05:21,124
Let's check it again.

569
01:05:21,197 --> 01:05:22,630
Mom, l did it.

570
01:05:22,966 --> 01:05:24,866
We got to stay calm, okay?

571
01:05:24,934 --> 01:05:28,165
lf we stay calm, everything will be fine.
All right? Stay calm.

572
01:05:28,238 --> 01:05:29,796
You're making me nervous.

573
01:05:30,073 --> 01:05:31,665
l'm sorry.

574
01:05:33,343 --> 01:05:34,867
What if l keep dropping?

575
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:38,977
You won't. l'll figure something out.

576
01:05:41,684 --> 01:05:43,276
You know, he's right.

577
01:05:44,187 --> 01:05:46,485
There's no way
we're getting into that room.

578
01:05:46,556 --> 01:05:48,148
What are you talking about?

579
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:52,392
l just got to be honest with myself here.

580
01:05:53,062 --> 01:05:54,825
l don't need to be involved...

581
01:05:54,897 --> 01:05:58,731
...with anything so harrowing
or perilous at this point in my life.

582
01:05:58,801 --> 01:06:01,702
-You're giving up?
-Hell, yes.

583
01:06:01,904 --> 01:06:05,601
l don't need the fucking aggravation.
l'll make an anonymous phone call.

584
01:06:05,675 --> 01:06:09,839
They'll find the floor safe. l'll inherit.

585
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,745
Stephen, Jeffrey, Catherine, David.

586
01:06:12,949 --> 01:06:16,407
Five grandkids, 60 percent inheritance tax.

587
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:20,683
Fuck, l'll still put away 8 or 900 grand
and keep my goddamn hair.

588
01:06:21,624 --> 01:06:24,650
Take it. Go out and get loaded.

589
01:06:25,461 --> 01:06:27,258
Wait a minute.

590
01:06:28,298 --> 01:06:30,459
Say what you just said again.

591
01:06:36,339 --> 01:06:39,137
Say that shit about the money
again, babycakes.

592
01:06:40,109 --> 01:06:43,704
When? Before?

593
01:06:44,013 --> 01:06:45,344
Yeah, before.

594
01:06:45,415 --> 01:06:49,112
Splitting the money in your head,
you said you'd put away 800 or 900 grand.

595
01:06:50,553 --> 01:06:52,180
What are you doing?

596
01:06:52,255 --> 01:06:56,282
That was after tax, which makes it more
than a million and a half gross.

597
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:00,051
So now you're a tax attorney.

598
01:07:02,765 --> 01:07:05,928
-l'm out of here.
-Wait a minute.

599
01:07:06,235 --> 01:07:10,638
There's sugar in everything.
Places you'd never expect. Like ketchup.

600
01:07:10,873 --> 01:07:12,340
Where else?

601
01:07:15,178 --> 01:07:16,907
Travel kit.

602
01:07:16,979 --> 01:07:19,777
Plus, you named eight people
you got to split it with...

603
01:07:19,849 --> 01:07:22,409
...so that's 10 or 12 million bucks
in the safe.

604
01:07:22,585 --> 01:07:25,748
A fuck-up like you has got to get less
than everybody else...

605
01:07:25,822 --> 01:07:27,847
...so now l don't know what to think.

606
01:07:28,224 --> 01:07:30,852
You're adding up money
you'll never touch, buddy.

607
01:07:31,894 --> 01:07:33,862
How much is in there?

608
01:07:35,998 --> 01:07:37,465
Mouthwash.

609
01:07:38,334 --> 01:07:39,301
Saccharin.

610
01:07:42,271 --> 01:07:44,899
Hey, l'm talking to you. Answer me.

611
01:07:45,341 --> 01:07:46,774
Fine. There's more.

612
01:07:47,577 --> 01:07:50,603
And when were you going to tell us
this minor economic detail?

613
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:53,114
lt doesn't matter now.
lt's totally fucking moot!

614
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:57,077
-Why are we having this conversation?
-What were you thinking?

615
01:07:57,153 --> 01:07:59,621
How did you expect to get away with this?

616
01:07:59,722 --> 01:08:01,815
Did you think that l'd open that safe...

617
01:08:01,891 --> 01:08:05,258
...and then me and Raoul would wait
while you picked out your share?

618
01:08:06,162 --> 01:08:08,027
What's the matter with you?

619
01:08:08,097 --> 01:08:11,157
You got us into this mess,
and you were going to fuck us?

620
01:08:11,234 --> 01:08:14,829
You got yourself into this.
You got the custody lawyers up your ass.

621
01:08:14,971 --> 01:08:17,701
Your eyes were huge
when l told you about the gig...

622
01:08:17,774 --> 01:08:19,241
...so don't play innocent.

623
01:08:19,809 --> 01:08:21,800
Things didn't work out.

624
01:08:23,246 --> 01:08:24,873
Play past it.

625
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:32,088
Mints? Sugar-free.

626
01:08:32,088 --> 01:08:32,816
Mints? Sugar-free.

627
01:08:32,922 --> 01:08:36,449
l'm opening that safe.
You leave, you get nothing.

628
01:08:36,526 --> 01:08:38,460
lt's looking doubtful there, big guy.

629
01:08:38,528 --> 01:08:42,362
l will split the money with Raoul.
But l don't ever want to see you again.

630
01:08:42,465 --> 01:08:46,196
Cops show up on my doorstep,
we will know who sent them...

631
01:08:46,436 --> 01:08:48,529
...and we will fucking find you.

632
01:08:53,009 --> 01:08:54,408
l'll see you, Burnham.

633
01:08:55,678 --> 01:08:56,906
Later, Raoul.

634
01:09:03,152 --> 01:09:04,380
Mom!

635
01:09:13,129 --> 01:09:16,462
Ride in a Town Car to 125th Street
a couple of times...

636
01:09:16,532 --> 01:09:18,727
...think you know all about it.

637
01:09:21,504 --> 01:09:23,768
You don't know nothing about me.

638
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:27,839
Sarah, listen to me:

639

You.

What did she say?

663
01:10:56,332 --> 01:10:58,391
Don't know. Cut off.

664
01:10:58,534 --> 01:11:01,230
-Phones are dead.
-Did you call anybody else?

665
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:06,565
Did you call the fucking cops, Stephan?

666
01:11:10,179 --> 01:11:11,077
No.

667
01:11:11,614 --> 01:11:13,309

You want me to just make something up?

Don't you look at me.

lt's not that l didn't try.

787
01:24:23,957 --> 01:24:27,654
Sometimes things, they don't work out
the way you want them to.

788
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:32,621
Done.

789

He had it all worked out.

791
01:24:39,839 --> 01:24:42,137
Nobody was supposed to even be here.

Oh, my god.

Can you move?

801

Not much. l think my arm is broken.

01:26:03,122 --> 01:26:04,453
Raise your arm.

Come on, raise your arm.

Come on. Try again.

806
01:26:31,117 --> 01:26:34,848
Meg, please don't do anything stupid.

807
01:26:37,557 --> 01:26:39,718
They're going to kill us.

808
01:26:39,792 --> 01:26:42,625
Just do everything they ask.
lt'll be okay that way.

809
01:26:42,895 --> 01:26:45,557
Stephan, they'll kill her.

810
01:26:59,212 --> 01:27:02,306
Holy shit. She called the goddamn cops.

811
01:27:02,482 --> 01:27:03,847
The police.

812
01:27:04,817 --> 01:27:06,216
You called the police?

813
01:27:06,285 --> 01:27:08,150
Of course, l called them.

814
01:27:08,688 --> 01:27:10,280
You scared the shit out of me.

815
01:27:10,356 --> 01:27:11,948
She killed the kid.

816
01:27:12,859 --> 01:27:15,191
She just killed her own kid.

817
01:27:16,195 --> 01:27:17,719
All right, take this.

818
01:27:18,798 --> 01:27:20,356
Don't say a word.

819
01:27:25,505 --> 01:27:27,530
No, her husband must have called them.

820
01:27:27,607 --> 01:27:30,440
Foreign son of a bitch. l told you!

821
01:27:31,611 --> 01:27:33,374
Where is she?

822
01:27:37,617 --> 01:27:38,584
There.

823
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:41,448
What the fuck's she doing?

824
01:27:58,071 --> 01:27:59,800
She's going to handle it.

825
01:28:03,743 --> 01:28:05,938

-You all right, ma'am?

827
01:28:16,322 --> 01:28:19,485
What are you<i>....</i> What time is it?

828
01:28:21,194 --> 01:28:22,855
lt's a little after 4:00 a.m.

829
01:28:23,262 --> 01:28:24,786
We got a call, ma'am.

830
01:28:25,965 --> 01:28:27,455
Somebody called you?

831
01:28:29,168 --> 01:28:30,465
Can we come in?

832
01:28:30,803 --> 01:28:32,168
What do you want?

833
01:28:32,238 --> 01:28:35,435
-We'd like to come in.
-No, you can't come in.

834
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:37,809
Ma'am, you sure you're all right?

835
01:28:38,578 --> 01:28:39,840
l'm fine.

836
01:28:41,114 --> 01:28:43,048
Ma'am, you don't look so good.

837
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:54,917
Well, you don't look so hot yourself,
Officer Keeney.

838
01:28:57,163 --> 01:28:59,154
Come on, l'm freezing out here.

839
01:29:02,034 --> 01:29:03,365
''There are three.''

840
01:29:04,837 --> 01:29:05,735
What?

841
01:29:06,706 --> 01:29:09,106
Your husband said you called for help.

842
01:29:09,475 --> 01:29:13,138
That you said, ''There are three''
right before you got cut off.

843
01:29:16,716 --> 01:29:18,377
Oh, that phone call.

844
01:29:18,718 --> 01:29:20,845
And your neighbors...

845
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:25,687
...called in about some loud shouts
or a loudspeaker of some kind?

846
01:29:28,528 --> 01:29:30,519
That was the TV. lt's off now.

847
01:29:31,831 --> 01:29:35,460
Can l just ask you one question?

848
01:29:36,402 --> 01:29:38,870
What was the end of that sentence?

849
01:29:41,808 --> 01:29:44,003
When you said, ''There are three''...

850
01:29:45,211 --> 01:29:46,735
...what was the rest?

851
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:52,339
Look<i>....</i>

852
01:29:56,088 --> 01:29:58,181
My husband and l just split up...

853
01:29:58,825 --> 01:30:02,261
...and it's my first night in a new house...

854
01:30:03,629 --> 01:30:05,824
...and l admit l was a little drunk.

855
01:30:07,133 --> 01:30:10,569
And the sentence,
if you insist on knowing...

856
01:30:11,804 --> 01:30:13,294
...was going to be:

857
01:30:15,508 --> 01:30:20,275
''There are three things that l'll do for you
if you come jump into bed with me.''

858
01:30:24,217 --> 01:30:29,120
Thank God l came to my senses
before l said all that, and l hung up...

859
01:30:29,755 --> 01:30:32,883
...so nobody would ever have to know
what l was thinking.

860
01:30:32,959 --> 01:30:34,449
Unless, of course...

861
01:30:34,694 --> 01:30:39,028
...two policemen came in the middle
of the night and interrogated me.

862
01:30:43,369 --> 01:30:45,098
So, Rick, you want to go?

863
01:30:45,671 --> 01:30:48,504
Or do you want her to tell you
which three things?

864
01:30:52,879 --> 01:30:53,971
All right.

865
01:30:54,213 --> 01:30:55,305
Ma'am...

866
01:30:58,818 --> 01:31:01,548
...if there's something you want
to say to us...

867
01:31:02,722 --> 01:31:06,317
...but maybe you can't say it right now...

868
01:31:08,895 --> 01:31:11,796
...you might want to make some kind
of a signal...

869
01:31:12,098 --> 01:31:15,295
...by blinking your eyes a few times.

870
01:31:16,903 --> 01:31:18,666
Something like that.

871
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:25,871
That's something you could do safely.

872
01:31:35,621 --> 01:31:36,610
Man...

873
01:31:37,790 --> 01:31:39,883
...you guys are good.

874
01:31:41,627 --> 01:31:45,324
You mean, like if there was somebody
in the house or something?

875
01:31:47,333 --> 01:31:49,801
They really train you guys.

876
01:31:53,739 --> 01:31:56,230
No, l'm fine. l'm fine. Cross my heart.

877
01:32:05,885 --> 01:32:08,046
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.

878
01:32:08,921 --> 01:32:10,183
'Night, ma'am.

879
01:32:24,203 --> 01:32:25,932
This kid has seen my face.

880
01:32:26,472 --> 01:32:28,770
Yeah, well, that's not my problem.

881
01:32:28,975 --> 01:32:31,967
Yeah, it is. You're here with me.

882
01:32:32,578 --> 01:32:34,239
You're on the hook, too.

883
01:32:35,081 --> 01:32:38,312
Do one. Same price for the rest.

884
01:32:41,387 --> 01:32:44,083
Stay the fuck away from me.

885
01:32:47,093 --> 01:32:49,084
You know how this is going to end.

886
01:34:05,104 --> 01:34:06,093
Goddamn!

887
01:34:43,008 --> 01:34:44,100
What's up?

888
01:34:57,690 --> 01:34:59,681
Why the hell didn't we do that?

889
01:35:05,498 --> 01:35:08,956
What's she doing?
What the fuck does she think she's doing?

890
01:35:09,034 --> 01:35:13,027
She's got your gun.
Who told you to bring a gun?

891
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:17,608
Just let me drill, man.

892

Because it's going to come to that.
