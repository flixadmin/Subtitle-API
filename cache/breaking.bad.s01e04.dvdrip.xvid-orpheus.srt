1
00:00:04,557 --> 00:00:05,830
Operation...

2
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:07,682
Icebreaker.

3
00:00:10,353 --> 00:00:13,094
How we liking that?
We never used that before, did we?

4
00:00:13,151 --> 00:00:15,178
- Isn't it the name of a breath mint?
- What?

5
00:00:15,206 --> 00:00:16,990
"Icebreakers", right? Breath mint?

6
00:00:17,093 --> 00:00:18,588
Nobody's gonna be
thinking that.

7
00:00:18,604 --> 00:00:21,410
They'll think about a big ass ship
in the North Pole, breaking ice.

8
00:00:21,537 --> 00:00:24,763
Says you. I'm gonna be thinking
"Operation Breath Mint."

9
00:00:24,905 --> 00:00:28,560
I'm thinking "Operation Breath Mint"
every time we're on a stakeout together.

10
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:31,498
Your breath could knock
a buzzard off a shit wagon.

11
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:32,875
All right.

12
00:00:32,913 --> 00:00:35,884
"Operation TBD."

13
00:00:36,273 --> 00:00:37,908
Thanks for nothing, Gomie.

14
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,764
Anyway.
Say hello to...

15
00:00:39,842 --> 00:00:43,348
Domingo Gallardo Molina,
AKA "Krazy 8."

16
00:00:44,436 --> 00:00:47,748
Smarter than your average cheese-eater.
I turned him out at the street-level,

17
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,722
but this dude's like
the Jeffersons: movin' on up.

18
00:00:50,728 --> 00:00:54,046
Every small-time dealers he'd throw at
us, he'd end up snaking their customers.

19
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:56,644
It turns out he's missing,
presumed dead.

20
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,987
Found his car
out in the boonies.

21
00:00:59,106 --> 00:01:03,077
Last guy he ratted out
was none other than his cousin,

22
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:05,388
Emilio Koyama.

23
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,791
You thinking the cousin
found out and took revenge?

24
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:10,397
Could be.
Turns out he's missing, too.

25
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:13,739
Normally, I'd say someone
did the world a favor.

26
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,160
But our snitch's car?

27
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:19,825
Turns out we find two grams of meth
in it, we take it to the lab.

28
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:23,325
They come back, they tell us it is
the purest they have ever seen.

29
00:01:23,327 --> 00:01:24,904
99.1%.

30
00:01:25,074 --> 00:01:28,283
Our chemist was blown away. He said
he couldn't do the same thing better.

31
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:31,303
Worse yet, it didn't come out of
some superlab in Mexico.

32
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:34,362
We're thinking this was cooked
right here, in the Land of Enchantment.

33
00:01:34,568 --> 00:01:38,113
Car was abandoned at
what appears to be a cook site.

34
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:41,071
This is the only other
thing left behind.

35
00:01:41,212 --> 00:01:44,481
We're sending it off to Quantico,
see if they can pull something off it.

36
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:48,767
Meantime, our guys swabbed the filter
element and found the same 99.1 meth.

37
00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:52,575
So be on notice.

38
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,496
We got new players in town.

39
00:01:56,726 --> 00:01:59,877
We don't know who they are,
where they come from...

40
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:03,147
but they possess an
extremely high skill-set.

41
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:04,805
Me personally?

42
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:09,462
I'm thinking Albuquerque just
might have a new kingpin.

43
00:02:44,155 --> 00:02:47,226
Jesus. Walt, you're burning
the shit out of them.

44
00:02:47,657 --> 00:02:48,852
Damn it.

45
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:51,770
Hey, Sky, you got
any more chicken?

46
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:54,608
Emeril here is gonna
need a fresh pack.

47
00:02:55,936 --> 00:02:57,416
All right,
looking good.

48
00:02:57,508 --> 00:03:00,256
Is this low-fat mayonnaise
in the cole slaw?

49
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:03,368
I don't know.
It's store-bought.

50
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:06,696
Hank, you need
another beer?

51
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:08,616
Does the Pope shit in his hat?

52
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:10,511
I don't think
that he does, Hank.

53
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,708
And I think everybody would like it
if you'd stop saying that.

54
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:16,663
- Marie, some more wine, maybe?
- I'm all right, thanks.

55
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,210
Hey, I want a beer.

56
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:21,393
Yeah. I want Shania Twain
to give me a tuggie.

57
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:23,712
Guess what?
That ain't happening, either.

58
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:26,035
- How about some more soda?
- Yeah, sure.

59
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,037
Honey, do you need anything?

60
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:31,219
- No, Walt. Thank you.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

61
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,243
What, are you kidding me?

62
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:56,704
You look like
a damn movie star, man.

63
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,498
Girls gotta be lining up
left and right.

64
00:03:59,952 --> 00:04:02,460
- Tell him how good-looking he is.
- He's adorable.

65
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,102
He don't wanna be friggin' adorable.
He wants to be hot.

66
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:08,018
You see what I'm talking about?
That's a female perspective.

67
00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:09,581
She supposed to say that.

68
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,412
Look, a guy doesn't have
to look like, uh...

69
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:15,554
Charlton Heston...
I'm talking "Moses" days...

70
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:17,648
to get a girl,
all right?

71
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,445
You just gotta have...

72
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:21,519
confidence.

73
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:24,805
Confidence and...
and persistence.

74
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,182
That's what I'm talking about.

75
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:30,002
I chased your Aunt Marie here
all over creation.

76
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:33,157
I kept bugging her for a date.
She kept saying no.

77
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,932
What, did I ask you
like 50 times?

78
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:38,069
It was before
they tightened the stalking laws.

79
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,622
Anyway, how about your dad here?

80
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:43,866
Right there's a good story, Walt.

81
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:45,414
Tell him how you met Skyler.

82
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:48,481
Mom was a waitress
in Los Alamos.

83
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:52,714
And Dad said
that thing to you...

84
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:55,500
Actually, your mother
wasn't a waitress.

85
00:04:56,093 --> 00:04:57,803
It was a summer job,

86
00:04:57,822 --> 00:05:00,449
and she was the hostess,

87
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:02,964
and she also worked
the cash register.

88
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:05,248
And I used to go
in there a lot

89
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:09,131
because it was close enough to the lab
where I could ride my bicycle.

90
00:05:10,965 --> 00:05:12,816
And once I noticed her...

91
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,150
it got to be so that
I would only go in

92
00:05:16,158 --> 00:05:18,152
when I knew she was working.

93
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:21,635
When it was slow,
she would lean against the counter,

94
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,108
doing her crossword puzzles,

95
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:26,447
but kind of hiding it, right,

96
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:28,880
pretending that
she was still working.

97
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,086
And once I caught on to that,

98
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:34,964
I would do crossword puzzles
while I ate my grilled cheese sandwich.

99
00:05:35,037 --> 00:05:37,405
It got so that
everyday at lunch,

100
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:41,356
we would both be doing
the New York Times crossword puzzle

101
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,444
ten feet from each other.

102
00:05:47,334 --> 00:05:48,574
Eventually,

103
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:51,617
I caught her
looking over at me.

104
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:56,226
So, I began saying,
"Excuse me.

105
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,249
"Fourteen across, seven-letter word
for whatchamacallit.

106
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:03,942
"May I ask what
you wrote down?"

107
00:06:06,984 --> 00:06:08,705
That got us talking.

108
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:12,786
Boy, I tell you, I was...
I was terrible at those puzzles.

109
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:17,199
I don't think that I finished
even one of them.

110
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:20,245
But your mother
would do them in ink.

111
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:22,451
Very smooth.

112
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:26,322
I'll bet you didn't think
your old man had it in him?

113
00:06:26,324 --> 00:06:28,668
But that's what I'm talking about.
That's persistence.

114
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:31,808
You see? Once you set
your cap for something,

115
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:34,741
or somebody,
you gotta just, you know...

116
00:06:37,656 --> 00:06:38,757
Skyler?

117
00:06:38,992 --> 00:06:41,272
Mom, are you all right?

118
00:06:43,655 --> 00:06:45,353
Shh, honey. It's okay.

119
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:47,613
What's the matter?

120
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,485
What is it?

121
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:55,311
Ask him.

122
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:07,704
What's she talking about?

123
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:13,646
Walt.

124
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:22,781
I have cancer.

125
00:07:27,931 --> 00:07:29,337
Lung cancer.

126
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,652
It's bad.

127
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,846
Ask him how long he's known.

128
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,403
I guess a month,
maybe, or...

129
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:10,261
For God sakes, Walt.

130
00:08:10,276 --> 00:08:13,337
We're just sitting out there having
a cookout like nothing's going on?

131
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:16,074
He made me promise
not to tell anybody.

132
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:18,985
Christ, these last 48 hours.

133
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,920
And it's the weekend,

134
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:24,731
so I couldn't even get
his doctor on the phone.

135
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:28,530
Buddy, why... I mean,
why wouldn't you want to tell anybody?

136
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:30,840
Don't you see?

137
00:08:31,273 --> 00:08:33,542
Everybody just wants
to help you.

138
00:08:33,998 --> 00:08:35,524
We're family.

139
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:38,240
We get through
these things together.

140
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,285
I mean, I don't get...
You know...

141
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:42,000
Lung cancer?

142
00:08:42,445 --> 00:08:44,434
How could that happen?
You don't smoke.

143
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,744
I'm thinking that
this goes back

144
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:49,243
20 years maybe
to the applications lab.

145
00:08:49,374 --> 00:08:51,653
All those chemicals
they had you working around?

146
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:53,877
We always took
the proper precautions.

147
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:57,739
One time you complained they didn't
give you the right kind of...

148
00:08:57,794 --> 00:09:01,064
I don't know, some kind
of ventilation hood or something.

149
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:03,923
- And then the headaches.
- Honey, it wasn't that.

150
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:06,782
How do they think they
can get away with this?

151
00:09:06,902 --> 00:09:08,822
We should hire a lawyer.

152
00:09:09,403 --> 00:09:11,742
First, let's deal with this.

153
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:16,190
Okay? So what's
the next step for Walt?

154
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:19,629
Certainly a second
opinion, right?

155
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:21,015
Right.

156
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:22,735
Right. Absolutely.

157
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,952
Okay. So first thing
tomorrow,

158
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:27,390
I talk to my radiologists,

159
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:30,347
we find you the best...

160
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:33,537
the oncology dream team.

161
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,257
I wanna go check
on Walt Jr.

162
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,074
I'm gonna see...

163
00:09:56,798 --> 00:09:59,948
if I can talk him into,
I don't know, joining us.

164
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,921
I really didn't mean for him
to find out that way.

165
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,631
Whatever happens...

166
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:19,923
I hope this goes
without saying, but...

167
00:10:20,061 --> 00:10:21,702
whatever happens...

168
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:25,236
I want you to know that...

169
00:10:26,532 --> 00:10:29,205
I'll always take care
of your family.

170
00:10:57,016 --> 00:10:59,352
Yo, check out
these fake Pop Tarts.

171
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:01,019
These are mad tight.

172
00:11:01,073 --> 00:11:03,748
- No, thanks, man. Pass.
- Your loss.

173
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:06,629
These are from Canada
or something. Imported.

174
00:11:06,942 --> 00:11:08,973
Yo, what happened
to your hallway, man?

175
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:11,835
- Did the ceiling fall down or...
- Oh, yeah...

176
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:15,734
I think the house
is just settling.

177
00:11:16,404 --> 00:11:18,631
It's been caving in
left and right.

178
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,393
Hit me in the eye.

179
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:21,963
It's bananas.

180
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,741
Yo, my pops could fix you up.
He's like a contractor or something.

181
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:28,819
Right on.
I should grab that number.

182
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:31,899
Say, Jesse.
You still cook a little crystal?

183
00:11:35,665 --> 00:11:37,072
Could be, yeah.

184
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:39,266
You know,
from time to time.

185
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:41,724
I heard you lost
your partner.

186
00:11:42,517 --> 00:11:43,565
Emilio.

187
00:11:45,394 --> 00:11:48,205
- Didn't he get locked up?
- No, man. He's out.

188
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:51,545
His cousin bailed him out.
He skipped town or something.

189
00:11:51,616 --> 00:11:53,726
I don't know about
any of that.

190
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,355
I've been kinda doing
my own thing these days.

191
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,109
But you maybe got
some crystal, man?

192
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:03,226
'Cause I could seriously go for a bowl.
You know? Take the edge off.

193
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:06,256
Hell, yeah.
Sunday night bowl, yo.

194
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:14,156
Maybe it just
so happens that...

195
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:17,673
I just recently cooked
the best batch ever.

196
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:23,714
Oh, yeah. Came up with
this whole new recipe.

197
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,748
It's more like a formula.

198
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:29,553
It's like way,
way more chemically...

199
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:32,905
You know, it's just the bomb.

200
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:36,226
But, you know, I don't know,

201
00:12:36,227 --> 00:12:39,599
I've been thinking lately
I'll just lay off of it for a while.

202
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,847
'Cause lately it's been
making me paranoid, so...

203
00:12:47,836 --> 00:12:50,913
You know, for, like...
like healthwise, just lay off.

204
00:12:51,095 --> 00:12:53,191
Yo, if you're not
into sharing, man,

205
00:12:53,196 --> 00:12:55,328
just tell us to piss off.
It's cool.

206
00:12:55,372 --> 00:12:57,025
We don't need no soap opera.

207
00:12:57,082 --> 00:12:58,428
Yeah, man.
Whatever.

208
00:12:58,474 --> 00:13:00,210
No, no.
It's all good.

209
00:13:00,216 --> 00:13:02,242
You know, I...
I'm just saying...

210
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,809
Hey, I got...
I got plenty of pot.

211
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:07,121
Yeah, I think
I'll bounce, man.

212
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,029
Yeah, sounds about right.

213
00:13:09,677 --> 00:13:10,833
Hey, yo, yo.

214
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:12,190
Hey, homes.

215
00:13:12,285 --> 00:13:13,634
I'm joking.

216
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,428
Okay, I'm totally
joking with you.

217
00:13:17,348 --> 00:13:19,220
You kidding?
Sit down.

218
00:13:26,628 --> 00:13:28,461
Best scante ever.

219
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,273
Grab that pipe.

220
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:48,557
Do you need
some help?

221
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,694
No, I'm fine, honey.

222
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:54,732
I'm fine. Just...

223
00:16:55,312 --> 00:16:56,484
Privacy.

224
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:57,823
Thanks.

225
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,782
I'm right outside
if you need me.

226
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,465
Yeah, anytime on Friday
is absolutely fine.

227
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:16,991
Thank you so much
for working us in.

228
00:17:19,614 --> 00:17:21,969
Can I just put that
on a credit card?

229
00:17:22,523 --> 00:17:23,484
Great.

230
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,575
Perfect.

231
00:17:24,781 --> 00:17:27,105
Okay, so we will see you

232
00:17:27,221 --> 00:17:29,556
at 10:45 on Friday morning.

233
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:32,136
Thank you so much.

234
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,557
Honey.

235
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:41,921
The best oncologist...

236
00:17:42,014 --> 00:17:43,895
I mean, not even
just in New Mexico,

237
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,945
but one of the top ten
in the entire nation...

238
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:50,129
His name is Dr. Delcavoli.

239
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:52,438
And we see him on Friday.

240
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:57,962
I mean, Marie really
came through for us.

241
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:00,112
She had her boss call and...

242
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:06,192
This is good.

243
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:09,162
From here on out,
things are gonna...

244
00:18:09,186 --> 00:18:11,622
What's that
we're putting on a credit card?

245
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,440
It's just a deposit
kind of thing.

246
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:18,473
- How much of a deposit?
- It's $5,000.

247
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,086
Five thousand?

248
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:30,425
And what's that?
Just to start?

249
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:32,719
Just to tell me
what I already know?

250
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,725
Walt, he's not
in our HMO, okay?

251
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,099
So be it.
We'll figure it out.

252
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:43,168
Come on. Don't get hung up
on money here.

253
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:45,579
We can always borrow
from Hank.

254
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:47,152
Absolutely not.

255
00:18:50,116 --> 00:18:51,271
No, I just...

256
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:53,326
We're not gonna do that.

257
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:56,347
Well, maybe we
can ask your mom.

258
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,804
Have you even
called her yet?

259
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,451
Regardless,
you're gonna have to tell her.

260
00:19:06,457 --> 00:19:08,847
- I'm willing to do it...
- I'll call.

261
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:15,790
I don't want us
thinking about money.

262
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:20,134
Money is not the issue here.
It's not.

263
00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:31,706
I'll take care of the deposit.

264
00:19:37,863 --> 00:19:40,137
I'll borrow it
from my pension.

265
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:18,540
What's up?

266
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:24,493
I thought I heard mice.

267
00:20:25,716 --> 00:20:27,538
That's all we need, huh?

268
00:20:29,485 --> 00:20:31,065
So, what's up, pal?

269
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,455
What the hell's
wrong with you?

270
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:37,779
What?

271
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:40,919
You're acting all...

272
00:20:44,724 --> 00:20:46,810
Why are you acting so...

273
00:20:47,183 --> 00:20:48,519
weird?

274
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:52,855
You're acting like
nothing is going on.

275
00:22:45,468 --> 00:22:46,617
Come on!

276
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:50,648
Am I gonna have to come down
there and whip your ass?

277
00:23:03,665 --> 00:23:07,231
And let me tell you something else.
I'm not doing this for charity, right?

278
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,951
I'm the best he's got in that office.
He knows it, I know it.

279
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:12,654
I expect to be paid
to a level comens...

280
00:23:13,555 --> 00:23:16,907
I said, "Dave, do you think
40 grand is a proper bonus?"

281
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:20,108
That's less than 10% of what
I booked for you guys this quarter.

282
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,498
I'm not going to sit here
and be disrespected.

283
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:24,608
Oh, he's shitin bricks.

284
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:26,240
Oh, you know he is.

285
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:28,771
Yeah, that man lives in fear.
I'll go across town.

286
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,414
Hell, I could go anywhere.

287
00:23:30,517 --> 00:23:33,962
Hoffman-Gordon-Bradley or Sorcher,
even Goldberg-Wayne.

288
00:23:34,008 --> 00:23:36,685
They'd make me a partner
just for walking in the damn door.

289
00:23:36,692 --> 00:23:38,684
That's how ecstatic
they'd be.

290
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:41,005
Hells, yes, brother-man!

291
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,104
Check this chick out.

292
00:23:45,718 --> 00:23:46,609
Who?

293
00:23:47,983 --> 00:23:49,647
Buddy, she's a cow.

294
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:51,819
Stacey's a cow.

295
00:23:52,523 --> 00:23:54,914
We're talking major
barnyard boo-hog.

296
00:23:55,242 --> 00:23:59,179
Roll her in flour and look for the wet
spot before you hit that, man. You know?

297
00:24:02,593 --> 00:24:03,454
Sir?

298
00:24:05,183 --> 00:24:06,191
Sir?

299
00:24:09,011 --> 00:24:10,534
Sorry. Hi.

300
00:24:11,557 --> 00:24:13,466
- What can I do for you?
- Which dude?

301
00:24:13,526 --> 00:24:15,611
The dude that looked
like a lizard?

302
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:18,958
I'm sorry.

303
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,320
I would like a cashier's check
in the full amount

304
00:24:23,614 --> 00:24:27,575
made out to Oncology Partners
of New Mexico, please.

305
00:24:28,818 --> 00:24:32,748
Oh, that's O-N-C-O-L-O-G-Y.

306
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:35,187
Yeah, you got it.

307
00:24:37,451 --> 00:24:39,553
I don't understand
why they're forcing you

308
00:24:39,556 --> 00:24:41,796
to choose between
the piccolo and the oboe.

309
00:24:41,835 --> 00:24:44,069
You show so much
promise with both.

310
00:24:44,128 --> 00:24:46,308
They can't have
any switching between woodwinds

311
00:24:46,323 --> 00:24:48,891
because no matter how divided up,
someone would be left out.

312
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:50,707
Well, rules are rules, I guess.

313
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:52,839
Sure, rules and rules.
I'm all for that.

314
00:24:52,863 --> 00:24:56,221
But I'm telling you,
you really shine on that oboe.

315
00:24:56,313 --> 00:24:58,810
You have real talent,
and I'm not just saying that.

316
00:24:58,926 --> 00:24:59,957
Thanks.

317
00:25:01,088 --> 00:25:04,757
What about Mr. Pemberton? Is he
giving you enough individual attention?

318
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:06,043
I'd have to say so.

319
00:25:06,077 --> 00:25:09,399
He tries to talk to each one of us
at least once during every practice.

320
00:25:09,402 --> 00:25:11,491
That's good.
Feedback's important.

321
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:13,238
It's key, I think.

322
00:25:14,184 --> 00:25:16,621
Hey, so how was
soccer practice?

323
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:23,145
I think that
was in our backyard.

324
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,502
Who's there?

325
00:25:39,302 --> 00:25:41,799
What the hell are you
doing out here?

326
00:25:44,886 --> 00:25:46,069
Hey, Dad.

327
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:48,890
Hey, Mom.

328
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:53,362
You got new patio furniture.

329
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:55,908
Right on!

330
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:00,820
My leg.

331
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,490
What do you think
it could be?

332
00:27:08,912 --> 00:27:10,975
God knows
I'm no expert.

333
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,486
I don't know.
Uppers, downers?

334
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:15,164
Your guess
is as good as mine.

335
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:18,240
I think we should check
his arms for needle marks.

336
00:27:22,234 --> 00:27:23,874
Do we let him stay?

337
00:27:24,545 --> 00:27:27,427
The Presbyterian Church
has those meetings.

338
00:27:27,797 --> 00:27:29,790
So maybe on condition,
you know?

339
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,749
If he agrees to attend?

340
00:27:32,704 --> 00:27:35,212
I just don't know
what to tell Jake.

341
00:27:44,646 --> 00:27:45,836
Good evening.

342
00:27:47,103 --> 00:27:48,674
Well, sleep well?

343
00:27:49,844 --> 00:27:52,534
What time's, uh...
What time is dinner?

344
00:27:54,268 --> 00:27:55,679
In about an hour.

345
00:27:59,586 --> 00:28:02,614
You know, I could wash
those clothes if you'd like.

346
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:04,752
They look a little lived in.

347
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:07,213
No, that's cool.

348
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:08,932
Maybe later.

349
00:28:14,105 --> 00:28:15,944
We are not doing this again.

350
00:28:16,002 --> 00:28:17,342
- Adam...
- No.

351
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:21,086
We said we'd lay down the law,
we lay down the law.

352
00:28:21,128 --> 00:28:23,713
We just have to be
consistent about it.

353
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:16,107
You're not taking the bus?

354
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:21,635
All right, well, listen.

355
00:29:22,434 --> 00:29:25,918
Give me maybe another 20 minutes
and we'll get out of here.

356
00:29:25,992 --> 00:29:27,222
All right.

357
00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:31,033
Yeah, good.

358
00:30:02,354 --> 00:30:05,893
You know,
I just think that...

359
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:12,182
things have a way
of working themselves out.

360
00:30:37,305 --> 00:30:39,166
When did you get this?

361
00:30:39,577 --> 00:30:41,895
Last May at
the year-end assembly.

362
00:30:42,005 --> 00:30:44,981
They gave me that one, too.
The one on the end.

363
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:49,411
Environmental
Consciousness Award.

364
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,647
What's that mean?
You, like, recycle cans and shit?

365
00:30:54,249 --> 00:30:56,945
I contacted the Albuquerque Journal
and asked what chemicals

366
00:30:56,947 --> 00:31:00,394
they use to bleach their paper. They
wound up writing an article about it.

367
00:31:00,466 --> 00:31:02,200
Right on, little bro!

368
00:31:02,412 --> 00:31:05,412
Making mad in-roads
with the business community.

369
00:31:05,482 --> 00:31:06,693
All right!

370
00:31:07,182 --> 00:31:08,788
Now, hey, remember,

371
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:12,320
not all learning
comes out of books.

372
00:31:16,644 --> 00:31:17,863
Look at you.

373
00:31:19,098 --> 00:31:21,487
We should hang out more often.

374
00:31:21,758 --> 00:31:23,353
You know, just...

375
00:31:23,665 --> 00:31:25,633
just kick back and chill.

376
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,806
I mean, if you ever,

377
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,408
like, I don't know,
need advice.

378
00:31:31,694 --> 00:31:35,173
Because, yo, I mean,
I've been through it all. For real.

379
00:31:38,654 --> 00:31:40,145
Hey, man, you...

380
00:31:40,684 --> 00:31:42,372
You play the flute?

381
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,615
It's a piccolo, actually.

382
00:31:44,626 --> 00:31:47,359
Dude, play some...
play some Jethro Tull.

383
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:51,279
Hey, guys.

384
00:31:51,287 --> 00:31:52,952
How we doing in here?

385
00:31:53,657 --> 00:31:54,759
We're good.

386
00:31:58,906 --> 00:32:00,189
Yeah. Fine, Mom.

387
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:01,982
Well, that's good.

388
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:04,039
That's... That's great.

389
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,848
What the hell?

390
00:32:14,445 --> 00:32:15,711
You see this?

391
00:32:16,732 --> 00:32:19,357
What, am I some criminal
or something?

392
00:32:19,767 --> 00:32:21,650
- Whatever.
- Whatever?

393
00:32:22,616 --> 00:32:24,759
What, you think that's okay?

394
00:32:25,134 --> 00:32:27,408
Like, "Oh, we can't
let that scumbag

395
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:30,011
"warp the mind of
our favorite son."

396
00:32:30,846 --> 00:32:32,400
I'm the favorite?

397
00:32:33,457 --> 00:32:34,699
Yeah, right.

398
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,380
You're practically
all they ever talk about.

399
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,769
Oh, snap.

400
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:20,238
Awesome.

401
00:34:55,145 --> 00:34:56,513
Yo, man, it's me.

402
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:59,502
Hey, listen.
You know, that product?

403
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:02,326
You got any more of that?

404
00:35:02,485 --> 00:35:04,870
Nah, man, okay?
I'm done giving out freebies.

405
00:35:04,874 --> 00:35:07,268
You want charity,
go ask the Salvation Army.

406
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:08,847
No, no charity.

407
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:11,763
I got this cousin,
he's got him some rich friends.

408
00:35:11,842 --> 00:35:14,633
These dudes are in town.
They're looking to par-tay.

409
00:35:14,807 --> 00:35:17,766
And your stuff is,
like, so sweet.

410
00:35:18,226 --> 00:35:19,822
So what do you say?

411
00:35:20,882 --> 00:35:22,928
You up for making
some fat stacks?

412
00:35:22,952 --> 00:35:25,580
Because they'll buy
everything you got.

413
00:35:44,873 --> 00:35:46,607
You can't be serious.

414
00:35:48,143 --> 00:35:49,934
What the hell
are you doing here?

415
00:35:49,968 --> 00:35:52,038
Yo, I waited till
the bowl buster left.

416
00:35:52,095 --> 00:35:54,064
I mean, no offense.

417
00:35:56,581 --> 00:35:57,784
Who sent you?

418
00:35:58,795 --> 00:36:01,297
You wearing a wire?
You setting me up?

419
00:36:02,518 --> 00:36:04,143
A wire?
You want a wire?

420
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,791
I got a wire.
Speak into the mic, bitch!

421
00:36:07,076 --> 00:36:09,735
What the hell's wrong
with you? A wire.

422
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,628
So who did you tell about...

423
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:19,212
- Nobody. What are you, nuts?
- Then why are you here?

424
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,681
I don't know.

425
00:36:23,295 --> 00:36:24,383
To, like...

426
00:36:24,846 --> 00:36:26,173
touch base.

427
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:28,381
Touch base?

428
00:36:29,469 --> 00:36:30,948
Yeah, you know...

429
00:36:31,631 --> 00:36:33,039
what you call...

430
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:34,982
a debrief?

431
00:36:35,503 --> 00:36:37,219
Maybe we could, like...

432
00:36:37,477 --> 00:36:39,440
I thought we could debrief.

433
00:36:39,543 --> 00:36:40,732
Debrief?

434
00:36:41,704 --> 00:36:42,860
Wow, that's...

435
00:36:43,444 --> 00:36:46,209
that's what you think we need,
to debrief?

436
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:52,580
Yeah, after what happened,
it just seems like the thing to do.

437
00:36:53,057 --> 00:36:55,110
Kind of, you know,
talk about it.

438
00:36:55,193 --> 00:36:57,923
We can't talk to anybody else.

439
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:02,196
Anyway, that,
and I wanted to...

440
00:37:02,547 --> 00:37:05,665
I wanted to tell you
how much everybody digs

441
00:37:06,344 --> 00:37:08,149
that meth we cooked.

442
00:37:08,278 --> 00:37:10,109
Everybody digs the meth...

443
00:37:10,614 --> 00:37:11,880
we cooked.

444
00:37:13,096 --> 00:37:14,636
Seriously, I got...

445
00:37:14,872 --> 00:37:18,319
dudes that would give
their left nut for a little more.

446
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,200
Great.

447
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:22,476
I'm just saying, if you ever...

448
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,441
saw your way clear to...

449
00:37:27,422 --> 00:37:29,063
You know, you and I...

450
00:37:29,888 --> 00:37:31,669
cooking a little more.

451
00:37:40,487 --> 00:37:42,267
Get the hell off my property.

452
00:37:42,289 --> 00:37:45,538
- What? I'm just saying.
- Go and don't come back.

453
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,834
Now!

454
00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:50,345
All right.

455
00:37:51,489 --> 00:37:52,781
You know what?

456
00:37:53,568 --> 00:37:54,863
Four grand.

457
00:37:56,331 --> 00:37:59,643
Your share
from selling that batch.

458
00:38:00,472 --> 00:38:02,183
That's why I'm here.

459
00:38:03,185 --> 00:38:04,755
Yeah, that's right.

460
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:06,881
I didn't smoke it all.

461
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:34,795
Non-small cell adenocarcinoma.

462
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,482
Stage 3a,

463
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:39,789
which means it's spread
from the lung to the lymph nodes.

464
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,359
There's no denying
it's very serious.

465
00:38:43,148 --> 00:38:44,470
But is it...

466
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,164
It is...

467
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,659
curable?

468
00:38:50,547 --> 00:38:52,697
I prefer the word "treatable."

469
00:38:53,587 --> 00:38:57,055
But the treatments we have at our
disposal can be very effective.

470
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:59,260
Without making any promises,
I can tell you that

471
00:38:59,263 --> 00:39:02,664
the specific course of radiation
and chemotherapy I'm going to suggest

472
00:39:02,712 --> 00:39:04,365
has been successful.

473
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:08,329
In certain cases, it prolonged patients'
lives and even resulted in remission.

474
00:39:10,764 --> 00:39:13,146
What about
the side effects?

475
00:39:13,355 --> 00:39:17,081
Well, they can be mild
to practically non-existent,

476
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,212
or they can be
pretty darn awful.

477
00:39:19,227 --> 00:39:21,031
It varies from patient to patient.

478
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:22,955
Typically, there's hair loss,

479
00:39:23,019 --> 00:39:26,857
which begins a couple of weeks
after the start of chemotherapy.

480
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:30,491
You may find yourself unusually
fatigued, not much energy.

481
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,382
You won't want
to get out of bed.

482
00:39:32,391 --> 00:39:36,281
You may lose weight due to reduced
appetite and certain intestinal issues.

483
00:39:36,596 --> 00:39:39,985
Muscle aches and pains,
gums get sore and bleed.

484
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:43,795
And, of course,
there's the possibility of nausea.

485
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:47,897
Although, we'll prescribe an anti-emetic
and try to counteract that.

486
00:39:48,003 --> 00:39:49,870
Possible kidney
or bladder irritation.

487
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:52,668
You may wind up with
increased bruising and bleeding.

488
00:39:52,709 --> 00:39:55,222
There may be sexual side effects.

489
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,964
Your skin may become
dry and irritated...

490
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,522
Got anything to say?

491
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,769
What do you know
about that?

492
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:41,578
- Nothing.
- That's not going to fly this time.

493
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:44,140
How many chances
have we given you?

494
00:40:44,707 --> 00:40:46,983
How many times
have we sat right here

495
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:49,243
and had the same conversation
over and over again

496
00:40:49,245 --> 00:40:52,043
where you look us in the eye
and you plead ignorance,

497
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:54,094
and you play
on our emotions,

498
00:40:54,126 --> 00:40:56,831
and you tell us anything
you think we want to hear

499
00:40:56,835 --> 00:40:59,690
just so we'll give you
another chance?

500
00:40:59,863 --> 00:41:03,528
And it makes us feel
like fools, every time.

501
00:41:08,245 --> 00:41:09,713
Enough, Jesse.

502
00:41:11,112 --> 00:41:12,204
Enough.

503
00:41:13,447 --> 00:41:16,259
We are not going
to have this in our house.

504
00:41:17,613 --> 00:41:19,369
We need you to leave.

505
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:01,619
Thanks for not telling on me.

506
00:42:06,472 --> 00:42:08,672
You think
I could have it back?

507
00:42:23,396 --> 00:42:25,184
It's skunk weed anyway.

508
00:42:49,728 --> 00:42:52,519
You know,
this is actually very hopeful.

509
00:42:59,074 --> 00:43:00,541
Did you hear me?

510
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:04,097
I said this is really
very, very hopeful.

511
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:12,607
Can I call them and tell them
you'll start next week?

512
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:30,288
I just think that we need to...

513
00:43:30,891 --> 00:43:33,028
discuss it a little more,
that's all.

514
00:43:33,036 --> 00:43:35,349
What is there to discuss?

515
00:43:35,419 --> 00:43:37,566
You're going to get
the best treatment

516
00:43:37,665 --> 00:43:39,377
and he's the best.

517
00:43:39,437 --> 00:43:41,349
Well, there's the money discussion.

518
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:44,792
$90,000 out of pocket.

519
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,187
- Maybe more.
- There's a way, Walt.

520
00:43:47,203 --> 00:43:50,878
There's financing,
there's installment plans.

521
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,100
I could always go back to work.

522
00:43:53,201 --> 00:43:55,277
Walt, there's always a way.

523
00:43:55,307 --> 00:43:56,354
All right.

524
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:59,517
Skyler, say that
there is a way.

525
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:02,504
And we spend
all that money, and...

526
00:44:14,775 --> 00:44:18,103
Am I supposed to leave you
with all that debt?

527
00:44:22,272 --> 00:44:24,937
I just don't want
emotions ruling us.

528
00:44:26,595 --> 00:44:29,175
Maybe treatment
isn't the way to go.

529
00:44:30,728 --> 00:44:34,009
Then why don't you just
fucking die already?

530
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,006
Just give up and die.

531
00:45:29,098 --> 00:45:30,832
Come on, move your ass.

532
00:45:34,144 --> 00:45:35,584
What do I care?

533
00:45:36,826 --> 00:45:40,013
Yeah, I'm not worried.
I have the best fucking attorney.

534
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:43,176
I would not want to be
on the other side of this one...

535
00:47:02,227 --> 00:47:03,593
What the hell?

536
00:47:10,448 --> 00:47:13,893
What are you doing?
Call somebody, call the fire people.

537
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:18,952
I don't believe it.
You know how much I paid for that?

538
00:47:23,765 --> 00:47:25,499
Why is it doing this?
