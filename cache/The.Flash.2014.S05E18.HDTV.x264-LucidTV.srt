1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,270
My name is Barry Allen and I
am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:04,275 --> 00:00:07,236
To the outside world I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist.

3
00:00:07,237 --> 00:00:10,199
But secretly with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,219
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,479
But when my daughter came
back from the future to help,

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,699
she changed the present.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,499
And now our world is more
dangerous than ever.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,879
And I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,450
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,579
Previously on "The Flash"...

11
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,359
Follow my instructions
and we'll defeat Cicada.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,886
Destroy his dagger and save your father.

13
00:00:32,887 --> 00:00:35,973
That is a new timeline
struggling to break through.

14
00:00:35,974 --> 00:00:39,142
Thawne, another Cicada showed up.

15
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,609
I used to think that keeping secrets

16
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,731
from people would protect
them, but you can't really

17
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:46,441
know someone with walls between you.

18
00:00:46,442 --> 00:00:48,679
Eobard Thawne, the Reverse Flash.

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,600
Your partner. Your secret.

20
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,220
Dad, I'm sorry I lied to you!

21
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,690
So am I.

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,789
Dad, please. I wanted to tell you.

23
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,029
Dad! I tried to tell you.
I'm sorry I lied to you!

24
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,399
- It's Nora, our daughter.
- She lied to us, Iris.

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,926
Since the first day she got here,

26
00:01:12,927 --> 00:01:14,553
about Thawne!

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,851
She knows what he did to us. To me.

28
00:01:20,852 --> 00:01:22,449
To my mother.

29
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,039
I can't believe a word she says.

30
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,605
- We don't know that.
- Yes, we do!

31
00:01:25,606 --> 00:01:27,889
We don't even know why
she's working with him.

32
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,903
Now the pressing question
is not why Nora is working

33
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,572
with the Reverse Flash.

34
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:37,529
Maybe I can talk to her and
shed some light on the matter.

35
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,980
I think you've shed enough light.

36
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,879
Why, are you upset at
me? What I should do?

37
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,269
I should just... I should
not have told you?

38
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,543
How long has it been
since you suspected her?

39
00:01:46,544 --> 00:01:47,711
Since I arrived.

40
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,899
Wow.

41
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,560
So you've been following
this trail all this time

42
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,175
and you didn't think to
tell us about it until now?

43
00:01:56,176 --> 00:01:57,779
I don't know where this trail leads.

44
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,149
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm not kidding you.

45
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,659
You don't come to a
conclusion without facts.

46
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,680
All the facts.

47
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,069
Shirley, I think, uh, maybe
you should just give us

48
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,080
all a minute here.

49
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:15,029
What, you're mad at me for doing what

50
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,448
a master detective does.

51
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:17,949
Figure out something that you cannot.

52
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,037
I give you that translation.
Your anger is misplaced.

53
00:02:21,038 --> 00:02:25,699
Look, whatever reason
Nora didn't tell us,

54
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,834
I don't think she did it maliciously.

55
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,160
Guys, even from here, I can
feel how upset she is.

56
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,099
All right, babe, you've been around Nora

57
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,210
for months.

58
00:02:35,218 --> 00:02:37,319
You never felt that she was
hiding something before.

59
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,499
No, never. Never.

60
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,799
Well, Thawne lied. He
was a master at it.

61
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,879
It stands to reason he
must have taught Nora some

62
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,829
- of his same tricks.
- Maybe.

63
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,939
Maybe not.

64
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,620
There's gotta be some
way to figure it out.

65
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:54,569
There is.

66
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,995
I'm guessing this has everything
from the day she arrived.

67
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:05,380
Maybe before.

68
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,729
Read it.

69
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,119
From the beginning.

- Synced & corrected by<font color="#E83286"> MementMori </font>-

71
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,809
- Please stand back from the perimeter.
- Excuse me. Sorry.

72
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,199
Uh, excuse me.

73
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,839
- Excuse me, pardon me.
- Incoming call from Mom.

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,180
Mom, come on.

75
00:03:29,188 --> 00:03:30,939
Ooh! I'm so sorry.

76
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,149
I just... I'm really late.

77
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,049
I'm... I'm really late
for an important date.

78
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,359
Not a date, date. Not
that I don't date, date.

79
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,249
I date, date. It's just,
I have a meeting.

80
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,449
I'm making myself later. Sorry.

81
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,959
Anyone seen CSI?

82
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,970
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

83
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,329
Where is West-Allen?

84
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,940
Ah, I'm so sorry, Detective
Curtis. I didn't mean to be late.

85
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,539
I tried to hail a hover-taxi, but
they kept passing me by and then

86
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,879
- I had to run all the way from...
- I really don't care

87
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,760
what your reason is
this time, West-Allen.

88
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,923
I just wanna find what meta did this.

89
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:58,769
Of course.

90
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,739
Chemical transport truck
on its way to Dayton Labs.

91
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,681
It was attacked earlier this morning.

92
00:04:03,682 --> 00:04:06,499
But that makes two labs

93
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,699
and another two transports this week.

94
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,119
And like the others, no one saw anyone.

95
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,720
God, there's residue everywhere.

96
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,029
- Benzene Methanol.
- That's what they stole.

97
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,179
What's that used for?

98
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,439
Anything from nanotech to treating lice.

99
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,119
- Halothane.
- Halothane?

100
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,332
- Wait a second.
- What?

101
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,279
This truck has an Affinity
4,000 security camera.

102
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,379
God, Lia's gonna be so jealous.

103
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,091
Whenever the 4,000's tampered with,

104
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:43,719
its failsafe releases a
incapacitating agent.

105
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,760
Halothane.

106
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,460
So you're saying whoever
did this picked the lock,

107
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,724
disabled the camera, and stole
might-be-lice medicine?

108
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:53,959
All before this incapacitating
agent could do its job?

109
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,260
And no one saw them.

110
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,359
How is that possible?

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,407
A speedster?

112
00:05:04,408 --> 00:05:06,769
Nora, labmate, friend of mine,

113
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,709
You didn't happen to pitch
your speedster theory

114
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,239
to Detective Curtis, did you?

115
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,792
It is not a theory, Lia. It
is the only explanation.

116
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,199
You know I'm equally a fan

117
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,671
of our fleet-footed super friends.

118
00:05:17,672 --> 00:05:19,130
I mean, honestly, if I could have ever

119
00:05:19,131 --> 00:05:21,758
met Jesse Quick, it's like,
hello, new best friend.

120
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,619
- No offense, um...
- Some taken.

121
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,859
Okay, but there hasn't been
a speedster in Central City

122
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,159
since that crisis piece
your mom wrote about, like,

123
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,226
decades ago.

124
00:05:31,227 --> 00:05:33,239
I mean, Flash, Kid Flash, Jay Garrick,

125
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,689
that... that weird purple
speedster that just

126
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,499
showed up one day.

127
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,939
They're all gone.

128
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,444
So what you're suggesting,
highly unlikely.

129
00:05:41,445 --> 00:05:42,739
Then we need to start believing

130
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,309
in the highly unlikely.

131
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,739
Alternatively, um, you could...

132
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,494
Dial back your obsessiveness.

133
00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:50,979
I'm not obsessive.

134
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,619
You never got to know your dad.

135
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,919
So you became a CSI just like him,

136
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,539
and it's why you keep
investigating the one case

137
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,859
Barry Allen never solved.

138
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,169
Cicada.

139
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,120
You call that obsessive.
I call that a hobby.

140
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,420
Right, your, um... your
classic everyday...

141
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,439
murder hobby.

142
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,569
It's like your mom says.

143
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,813
You're, uh... you're excessive.

144
00:06:16,814 --> 00:06:19,280
Do not quote my mother.

145
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,159
God, I wish CCPD would spring for one

146
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,169
of these Affinity cameras.

147
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,114
I mean, trillion FPS,
captures light in motion.

148
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:28,449
W-T-Shrap?

149
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,959
- That's lightning.
- The canister's gone.

150
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,629
White lightning. A speedster.

151
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,919
- Okay, maybe.
- No, not maybe.

152
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,251
It is! I knew it!

153
00:06:38,252 --> 00:06:39,878
Okay, fine, you're right. But...

154
00:06:40,963 --> 00:06:43,139
But what is a speedster
doing stealing chemicals?

155
00:06:45,676 --> 00:06:49,469
And Eobard Thawne, aka
the Reverse-Flash,

156
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,719
was finally defeated and incarcerated

157
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,679
and will remain in Iron Heights Prison

158
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,519
- for the rest of his days.
- I know.

159
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,020
Incoming call from Mom.

160
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,859
See? I knew it.

161
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,940
There was never a speedster
with white lightning.

162
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,739
All yours.

163
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,479
- Thanks.
- Thank you for visiting

164
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,469
the Flash Museum today.

165
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,539
The building will be
closing in five minutes.

166
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,409
All guests should make
their way to the exit now.

167
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,099
And Nora West-Allen, your mother called.

168
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,939
Please, for your sake and mine,

169
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,749
call her back.

170
00:07:29,845 --> 00:07:31,919
So embarrassing.

171
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,849
Mom, why are you calling Mr. Myles?

172
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,079
I tried you at your lab.
You weren't answering.

173
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,459
I left three messages. You
never returned any of them.

174
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,729
What else was I supposed to do?

175
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,357
Wait for me to call you back?

176
00:07:42,358 --> 00:07:43,629
Why isn't your holo on?

177
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,069
Uh, it doesn't work in the Flash Museum.

178
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,679
For the life of me,
I've never understood

179
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,819
your obsession with that place.

180
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,959
What are you even doing there?

181
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,339
Are you there alone?

182
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,702
It's fine, Mom. I'm researching a case.

183
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:55,869
- What kind of case?
- One that I can't talk about.

184
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,339
I'm your mother, Nora.

185
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,359
And I'm an employee of CCPD

186
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,889
who can't talk about open cases.

187
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,559
Mom, how many times do I
have to tell you this?

188
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,419
You were married to a CSI.

189
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,319
Yes, I was.

190
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,289
I'm sorry.

191
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,380
What were you calling about?

192
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,359
I thought my daughter might
want to know how I'm doing

193
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,760
in Coast City.

194
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,899
I almost finished my story.

195
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,729
I should be home in a few days.

196
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,799
Great.

197
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,499
Uh, Mom, I gotta go. It's work.

198
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,659
- Love you.
- Love you.

199
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,069
Hey.

200
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,539
Hey, meet me at Ollins Laboratory.

201
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,779
I sent the list of stolen chemicals
to an old teacher of mine

202
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,860
and I think he found something.

203
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,319
Appreciate the help, Dr. Bonwit,

204
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,579
- especially at this hour.
- Not a problem.

205
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,859
Ollins never lets me
leave this place anyway.

206
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,649
So Lia was telling me

207
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,659
you might know how these chemicals

208
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,820
- can be used together.
- Yes and no.

209
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,729
Took me a bit to see it,
but the only way they seem

210
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,594
to work together is if they're
built on a structure.

211
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:54,596
Like an extracellular matrix.

212
00:08:54,597 --> 00:08:57,849
But there are thousands of
extracellular matrices.

213
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,101
So until we know all the chemicals,

214
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:00,800
we won't know the end results.

215
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,430
Sorry I can't help more.

216
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:06,233
That's okay. Thanks, Dr. Bonwit.

217
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,679
Now what?

218
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,719
We can't just wait for
another lab to get hit.

219
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,784
Holy shrap!

220
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,000
Dr. Bonwit!

221
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,041
Oh, my God!

222
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:27,253
Yes, I am a god.

223
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,508
The god of speed.

224
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:33,343
Go, go, go, go, go!

225
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,935
Nora!

226
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,809
Nora!

227
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,120
Somebody help, please! Someone help!

228
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,719
Nora?

229
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,739
♪ Can't read my, can't read my ♪

230
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,359
- Nora?
- ♪ No, he can't read my poker face ♪

231
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,059
Oh, I knew an oldie would wake you up.

232
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,309
Okay, don't freak. Uh,
we're in a hospital.

233
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,219
Me for this burn and you
for a whole lot more.

234
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,330
- Dr. Bonwit?
- Uh, ICU.

235
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,540
But he's gonna pull through.

236
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,849
Um, but the speedster did get
away with a crazy amount

237
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,089
of Carbon Disulfide.

238
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,859
Don't worry about that right now.

239
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,419
How are you feeling?

240
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,725
I... I feel fine, actually.

241
00:10:22,726 --> 00:10:25,330
My fingers are a little
tingly but other than that,

242
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,259
I... I feel really good.
It's weird, right?

243
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,814
I'm just so glad you're okay.

244
00:10:29,815 --> 00:10:31,059
Your doctor said you got hit

245
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,579
with five billion joules of electricity.

246
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,240
Which means, um, I, uh...

247
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:39,849
I, uh, kind of called your
mom. Um, and she, uh...

248
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,371
She freaked more than
normal. Um, I had to.

249
00:10:43,372 --> 00:10:45,665
- You could have died.
- Lia, is she here?

250
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,319
She's on her way from Coast City.

251
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,590
Uh, and she is wearing her aggro pants.

252
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,930
I mean, she has called
me, like, 47 times.

253
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,959
You should have ignored her.
Just, I don't want her to worry.

254
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,199
I did.

255
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,699
Uh, which is why she
doesn't know about this.

256
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,879
The paramedics said that you
went into cardiac arrest

257
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,259
when you got here and so they had to use

258
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,919
the defib nodes to restart your heart,

259
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,390
and when they did, they found this.

260
00:11:05,394 --> 00:11:08,021
It was buried underneath the
scar under your right shoulder.

261
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:09,609
What is it?

262
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,659
They say it's a metal
scrap from the shelf

263
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,649
you got thrown into, but I don't know.

264
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,440
It looks kind of old
and... and pretty fried.

265
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,419
Okay, wait, but now that
we both know you're okay,

266
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,219
can we please talk about the
fact that you got struck

267
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,859
by lightning from a speedster?

268
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,959
So schway, right?

269
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,623
The only thing is no
one's gonna believe us.

270
00:11:26,624 --> 00:11:28,291
We both saw it. They're gonna have to.

271
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,330
Stay calm.

272
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,479
There has been an incident.
System check in progress.

273
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,354
What the hell?

274
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,040
Catch this.

275
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,401
I'm okay!

276
00:11:55,402 --> 00:11:57,679
You sure?

277
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,030
Yeah, dude. I'm a speedster.

278
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:04,170
All of my nerves are tingling
and my synapses must be

279
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:08,410
going crazy because my reaction
times are way off the charts.

280
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,043
What am I gonna do about my mom?

281
00:12:12,044 --> 00:12:15,672
She freaks out any time someone
even says the word meta.

282
00:12:15,673 --> 00:12:16,999
Okay, well, that's understandable.

283
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,419
I mean, her non-meta husband
died because of metas.

284
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,499
Yeah, but writing about the
Flash... the meta-human...

285
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,720
- made her career.
- So we can't tell her?

286
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:27,517
No, we can't tell anybody.

287
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:30,139
Not until we figure out
how I got these powers.

288
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,439
And I don't think it's a
coincidence that this happened

289
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,770
after my little run-in
with the god of speed guy.

290
00:12:35,776 --> 00:12:39,269
You mean when Godspeed hit
you with his lightning.

291
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,959
Which, according to the Flash Museum,

292
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,699
is exactly what happened to...

293
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,909
The Flash.

294
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,339
10-90 in progress.

295
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,579
Bank heist.

296
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,374
Huh.

297
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,879
No, no. You can't do that.
That is a bad idea.

298
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,439
That is like cut your own bangs bad.

299
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,859
I'm just gonna do a little run-by.

300
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,750
You are a CSI, not a superhero.

301
00:12:59,758 --> 00:13:01,859
Our jobs are the same as the cops.

302
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,845
We get the bad guys.

303
00:13:03,846 --> 00:13:07,974
All right. Go get 'em, Flash Woman.

304
00:13:07,975 --> 00:13:09,601
Lady Flash.

305
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:10,929
Hot Flash.

306
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,139
Not that one.

307
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,356
Okay, we're gonna workshop that later.

308
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:18,239
Until then, I have to
guard Central City.

309
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,700
Ah!

310
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:27,201
Stop or I'll fire!

311
00:13:28,662 --> 00:13:30,142
Keep your hands where I can see them!

312
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,628
Oh, um, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

313
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,220
Freeze!

314
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,580
Oh, uh...

315
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:49,599
What in the world?

316
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,679
Bug and Byte, you're under arrest!

317
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,609
- Go, go, go!
- Take them down!

318
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:00,079
You fried your gauntlet
and half the fleet.

319
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,379
It was only three cruisers.

320
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,759
Now Captain Frye's gonna
be on his warpath

321
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,490
which is gonna make
everybody's life miserable.

322
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:08,326
I'm sorry, Nora.

323
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:10,746
I know today didn't exactly go so great.

324
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:14,040
Both robbers got away because of me.

325
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,790
Cut yourself a slice of slack pie.

326
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:19,921
It was your first day. No one got hurt.

327
00:14:19,922 --> 00:14:21,550
And plus they found Bug
and Byte hunched over

328
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,590
with runner's cramps,
like, ten minutes later.

329
00:14:23,592 --> 00:14:25,919
But I still feel so bad.

330
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,220
You're looking at this all wrong.

331
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:30,264
Today was not Nora's big failure.

332
00:14:30,265 --> 00:14:34,279
Today was the Femme-Flash's big debut.

333
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,855
Naming superheroes is not easy.

334
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,170
Lia, you are the best
friend a shrappy speedster

335
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,200
could ever ask for.

336
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,199
But I think we both know
that CCPD isn't equipped

337
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,769
to stop this guy.

338
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,199
The only way we're
gonna catch him before

339
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,499
anyone else gets hurt
is if I start thinking

340
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,660
like a villainous speedster.

341
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:00,279
And how are you gonna do that?

342
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,507
I'm gonna go see one.

343
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,513
Reverse-Flash, huh?

344
00:15:10,514 --> 00:15:13,979
Well, officer, you're, like,
the second person in 15 years

345
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,529
who's come to visit this psychopath.

346
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,980
Not even a call.

347
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,699
Are you sure you want to
interview him by yourself?

348
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,277
I've been alone with criminals before.

349
00:15:32,202 --> 00:15:34,370
You have five minutes.

350
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,789
Eobard Thawne?

351
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,679
My name is Nora West-Allen,
and I'm a CSI tech

352
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,020
with the CCPD.

353
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:07,479
I wanted to ask you a few
questions, if I could.

354
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,169
Come closer.

355
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,839
Nora West-Allen.

356
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,080
Don't be afraid.

357
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,179
The dampening capabilities
of this cell can negate

358
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,949
the powers of 1,000 meta-humans.

359
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,639
The glass, the walls,
the ceiling, the floors

360
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,439
are all connected to a power
energizer that will zap

361
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,640
this place with 400 kilojoules instantly

362
00:16:40,645 --> 00:16:43,271
should the dampeners fail.

363
00:16:43,272 --> 00:16:45,429
Making the cell phase-proof.

364
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,469
I couldn't hurt you, Nora West-Allen.

365
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,109
Even if I wanted to.

366
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,914
What are your questions?

367
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,419
How did you end up in here?

368
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,719
Was there nobody at
CCPD that could answer

369
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,290
that question for you?

370
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:11,470
All the files pertaining
to the Reverse-Flash

371
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,960
have been cyber locked.

372
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:15,959
And there's almost nothing
about you in the Flash Museum.

373
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,769
Except for the date
of your imprisonment.

374
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,099
Really?

375
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,079
That's all there is in the Flash Museum?

376
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,390
That's interesting.

377
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:25,313
Will you tell me how you were defeated?

378
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:27,259
Why do you want to know that?

379
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,720
It'll help us with an investigation.

380
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,109
You need to work on your lying.

381
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,680
Nora.

382
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,749
Your shoes are new.

383
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,760
But your soles are worn.

384
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,665
You have singe marks on your sleeves

385
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,459
and singe marks on your pant legs,

386
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,059
but most of all, your cheeks are flushed

387
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,580
with windburn.

388
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,820
Oh, I know that windburn.

389
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,409
I can still feel it.

390
00:18:01,476 --> 00:18:03,179
You're a speedster.

391
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,152
Time's up.

392
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:14,404
Please, I need your help.

393
00:18:14,405 --> 00:18:15,989
Come on. Let's go.

394
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,449
Time to repent, Professor.

395
00:18:43,893 --> 00:18:46,389
Thawne figured out I had powers,

396
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,310
but he wouldn't tell me
anything about them.

397
00:18:50,942 --> 00:18:52,318
What?

398
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:56,059
And don't tell me it's nothing
'cause your whole face

399
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,120
says it's something.

400
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,620
You know this metal fragment

401
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,299
they found underneath your shoulder?

402
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,309
Yeah.

403
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,009
Well, something about it was bugging me,

404
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,664
so I did some digging.

405
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:08,639
It turns out it's not from that
shelf you got thrown into.

406
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,249
It's, uh... It's tech.

407
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,505
A chip made by S.T.A.R.
Labs 25 years ago.

408
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:17,092
Like a chip you would use
to find a lost animal?

409
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,139
It's to dampen your speed.

410
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,380
What?

411
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,939
You didn't get your powers

412
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,859
when Godspeed hit you
with his lightning.

413
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,895
It looks like you always had them.

414
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:32,023
I... I've always had powers?

415
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,509
Why do... Who would put a power
dampening chip inside of...

416
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,239
Your mom lied to you your whole life.

417
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,800
I mean, that's next-level aggro.

418
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,539
How could she keep something
like that from me?

419
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,920
I mean, what else has
she lied to me about?

420
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:55,755
I think you're gonna have to ask her.

421
00:19:55,756 --> 00:19:58,341
Oh, just the idea of that
makes my blood boil.

422
00:19:58,342 --> 00:19:59,634
That could be the macchiato.

423
00:19:59,635 --> 00:20:01,719
It's possible I might
have made that a triple.

424
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,182
At least I have one person in
my life I can still trust.

425
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,106
- A triple.
- That's been established.

426
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:16,290
No, no, no, not the coffee.
I mean, yes, the coffee.

427
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,219
But the chemicals that Godspeed stole.

428
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,139
Benzene Methanol is
unstable, and if you add

429
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,750
the Carbon Disulfide that
he stole from Ollins lab...

430
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,411
Kablooey. I remember that from
9th grade Analytical Chem.

431
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:28,690
And the only way to combine
all those chemicals together

432
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,739
is if you add some kind
of binding property.

433
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,759
Right, you'd need a
plus-one oxidation state,

434
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,470
like a... a Dioxygen Difluoride.

435
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,299
Yes, and somewhere that's
able to store that

436
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,969
and the only place in
Central City that can

437
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,339
is Stagg Industries.

438
00:20:45,264 --> 00:20:48,039
I cannot believe my first
time at Stagg Industries

439
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,739
is as a burglar.

440
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,020
Or are we vigilantes?

441
00:20:53,606 --> 00:20:55,249
Lia, I found it.

442
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,679
Unless your super speed
came with super biceps,

443
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,419
we are not getting this out of here.

444
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,743
That's mine.

445
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,330
Uh, okay. Try and get this open.

446
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:11,666
It'll evaporate in seconds.

447
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,079
If you want it,

448
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,140
you're gonna have to come
through me to get it.

449
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,000
Ah, you're a speedster like me.

450
00:21:19,006 --> 00:21:21,419
So you need it too.

451
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,820
Sorry.

452
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:42,659
No!

453
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,700
Lia! Lia!

454
00:21:52,707 --> 00:21:55,208
Lia!

455
00:21:55,209 --> 00:21:57,179
Lia!

456
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,921
The one person in the world
she thought she could trust

457
00:21:59,922 --> 00:22:01,631
died in her arms.

458
00:22:01,632 --> 00:22:03,717
Nora must have felt completely alone.

459
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,540
- But she wasn't.
- Yes, she was.

460
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,340
Because I wasn't honest with her.

461
00:22:09,348 --> 00:22:10,459
Iris...

462
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,559
After all I did, she
gave me a second chance.

463
00:22:14,186 --> 00:22:15,599
It's the least we can do for her.

464
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:28,742
Mom?

465
00:22:32,204 --> 00:22:34,622
Don't make me regret this.

466
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,820
What are you doing?

467
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,239
I'm giving our daughter the chance

468
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,400
to explain this for herself.

469
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,376
Nora.

470
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,959
I heard about... Lia.

471
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,459
Honey, I'm so sorry.

472
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,559
I know how it is to
lose someone you love.

473
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,779
If you don't wanna talk
about it right now,

474
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,779
that's okay.

475
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:43,099
Or maybe you just don't wanna
talk about it with me.

476
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:49,060
Nora, can I just make
sure that you're okay?

477
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,319
Nora, I went to the hospital
and they said that you left.

478
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,519
I guess lightning doesn't
hurt as much when you already

479
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,330
have it coursing through your veins.

480
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,378
Does this look familiar?

481
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,220
How about now?

482
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,540
- Nora...
- Lia found it before she died.

483
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,900
You put this inside of me, Mom.

484
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:19,602
To dampen my powers?

485
00:24:19,603 --> 00:24:21,479
You lied to me my whole life.

486
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,607
I know.

487
00:24:24,608 --> 00:24:27,110
Who else knows?

488
00:24:29,238 --> 00:24:30,988
Who else?

489
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,459
Everyone.

490
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,929
Everybody?

491
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:41,409
Everyone that I love has
been keeping this from me?

492
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,999
Why?

493
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,779
Because I told them to.

494
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,045
Why would you do that?

495
00:24:46,046 --> 00:24:47,779
Nora, I was trying to protect you.

496
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,919
- From what?
- From this city.

497
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,219
From... from meta-humans.
From... from yourself.

498
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,219
Wow.

499
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,100
- Nora, you don't understand.
- No, I don't understand.

500
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,519
How did I get my powers?

501
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,959
What do you have against speedsters?

502
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,560
Nora, I have already lost so much.

503
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:08,818
I can't risk losing you too.

504
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,823
Well, you just did.

505
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,469
I'm gonna miss Lia too.

506
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,079
West-Allen, we all know
how close you two were.

507
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,599
If you need some time off,
I'm sure Captain Frye...

508
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,719
We need to get the guy who did this.

509
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,980
Whatever it takes.

510
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,939
We ran the evidence
from the crime scene.

511
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,519
Turns out there was foreign
DNA in Lia's exit wound.

512
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,779
But we've used it to
positively ID this guy.

513
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:02,000
August Hart. Bio-hacker.

514
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,619
Mercury Labs intern,
and then grad school.

515
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,841
All yours.

516
00:26:13,842 --> 00:26:17,319
Says he was kicked out for
testing tachyon stimulants

517
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,499
on coma patients.

518
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,560
What the hell's a tachyon?

519
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,600
A particle that moves faster than light.

520
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,539
Well, an arrest warrant's
on its way now.

521
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,019
I promise you this guy's
gonna get what he deserves.

522
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,809
Yes, he will.

523
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,789
Did you know not all villains

524
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,719
had meta-human powers?

525
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,620
Some u...

526
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:45,660
- Make sure you get this.
- Everybody move!

527
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,899
Godspeed's lightning...

528
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,999
It turned blue, just like Zoom's.

529
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,939
Hey, wait a sec.

530
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,500
_

531
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,079
Although her body disintegrated,

532
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,309
authorities uncovered
evidence at Mercury Labs

533
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,290
of the illegal speed-enhancement drug,

534
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,659
Velocity-9.

535
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,159
This volatile stimulant gave
Trajectory incredible speed,

536
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,389
but at a deadly price.

537
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,819
That's it.

538
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,860
Benzene Methanol, Carbon Disulfide,

539
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,729
Dioxygen Difluoride.

540
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,969
The base for the extracellular
matrix for Velocity-9.

541
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:31,139
Only he's trying to make one
that will last forever.

542
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,760
How do I stop a speedster?

543
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,819
- You can't.
- Not alone.

544
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,439
But with you, I can.

545
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,220
No.

546
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,810
That plinth, it takes incoming calls

547
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,869
and from what I hear,
you have a few left.

548
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,919
You could walk me through it via comms.

549
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,269
No.

550
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,349
He has stolen enough chemicals to make

551
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,160
an extracellular matrix that
replicates speed powers.

552
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,260
I told you to leave.

553
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,549
The only thing that is
stopping him from becoming

554
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,159
a speedster permanently
is a stabilizing agent.

555
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,019
Once he gets that, he
will be unstoppable.

556
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,040
I told you to leave! Guard!

557
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,759
Please.

558
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,760
He killed my best friend in front of me.

559
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,840
She's gone because of him,

560
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,240
and you are the only
person that can stop it.

561
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,819
What the hell?

562
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,640
You need to leave now.

563
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,360
Nora.

564
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,439
Okay, I'm at the innovation lab at CCU.

565
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,420
- Are you there?
- Yes, I'm here.

566
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,959
Okay, are you sure this
is gonna short out

567
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,429
- the scanner circuits?
- Yes, I'm sure.

568
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:12,449
Vibrate your hands together.
Build an electric shock.

569
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,769
Okay.

570
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,800
Schway. It worked.

571
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,839
Now look for the brightest room.

572
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,149
The converter needs
constant fluorescent light.

573
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,119
Now locate the biometric converter.

574
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,940
It will be a kidney-shaped object

575
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,089
I think I found it.

576
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:43,129
No way for Godspeed to
stabilize his Velocity-9 now.

577
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,580
You don't learn, do you?

578
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,009
That's mine.

579
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,259
Come and get it.

580
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,019
It worked!

581
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,560
No.

582
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,819
He's got more V-9.

583
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,619
Nora, you need to get out of there now.

584
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,659
Right now!

585
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,049
I can't lose him!

586
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,719
Thawne!

587
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,119
Did you hear me? I
said I can't lose him!

588
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,139
All right, Nora, do you see any walls

589
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,199
near where you are, preferably concrete?

590
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,269
Why?

591
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,150
Because I want you to run into one.

592
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,519
Or rather, through one.

593
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,259
I can't run through a concrete wall!

594
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,269
Yes, you can.

595
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,139
If you vibrate at the
natural frequency of air,

596
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,929
your body... your cells will
be in such a state that they

597
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,770
will phase right through that wall.

598
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,569
I can't do this!

599
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,599
Nora, listen to me.

600
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,409
Listen to my voice.

601
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:01,170
Breathe.

602
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,839
Breathe.

603
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,749
Feel the wind on your face.

604
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,879
The ground beneath your feet.

605
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,749
And the lightning.

606
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,799
Its electricity surging
through your veins.

607
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,059
To your nerve endings from
the crown of your head

608
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,990
to the tips of your toes
like an electric shock

609
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,569
you never want to end.

610
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:28,550
You're part of something
greater now, Nora.

611
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,019
You are part of the Speed
Force and its power,

612
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,149
its power is yours to use. Now do it.

613
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,959
I can't.

614
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,100
I can't do it.

615
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,339
Then good-bye, Little Runner.

616
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,579
No, no. Uh, I'm sorry.

617
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,059
I trust you. Uh, what now?

618
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,959
Nora, you can't run forever.

619
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,269
You're gonna have to stop him.

620
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,029
Tell me what you see around you.

621
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,279
Um, uh, I'm on 5th and Park.

622
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,369
I see Choi Enterprises, Peercoin Bank,

623
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,379
and CC Citizen Media.

624
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,779
Media, the satellites.

625
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,099
Nora, we're gonna use the
satellites' electromagnetic

626
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,990
radiation to break the V-9 bonds.

627
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,959
Flood Godspeed with anti-endorphins.

628
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,779
Neutralizing the V-9 instantly.

629
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,139
Exactly, but here's the thing.

630
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,139
Those satellites recalibrate on the hour

631
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,339
emitting very short bursts
of microwave energy.

632
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,690
You're only gonna have a few
seconds to get Godspeed

633
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,549
in front of those bursts.
Do you understand?

634
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,889
So I just need him to follow
me into the building.

635
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,919
Not into the building. Up the building.

636
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,079
Uh, okay. I can do that.

637
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,269
Um, how fast do I have to
go to run up a building?

638
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,689
As fast as you can.

639
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:55,719
Here he comes.

640
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,759
Then run, Nora.

641
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,989
Run.

642
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:16,169
Wait for it, Nora. Wait.

643
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,139
And now!

644
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,239
Nora. Nora!

645
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,500
We did it!

646
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,079
We did it.

647
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,540
Yes, we did.

648
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,339
Well, we don't have to worry
about Godspeed anymore.

649
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,819
August Hart is in the custody of CCPD.

650
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,700
Bravo, Little Runner.

651
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,439
I still have a lot to learn, you know.

652
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:04,940
- You could train me.
- I can't train you, Nora.

653
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,909
There's just not enough time.

654
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:11,739
What... what are you talking about?

655
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,779
- You're...
- Nora.

656
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,460
My time on this earth
is coming to an end.

657
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:33,529
There's so much I wanted to ask you.

658
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,069
So much that I still don't know.

659
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,320
So much that my mom
has lied to me about.

660
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,120
You have no idea.

661
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,809
What do you know?

662
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,849
Thawne, please, you may
be the only person left

663
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,499
in my life who won't lie to me.

664
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,449
Nora,

665
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:59,340
how much do you really
know about the Flash?

666
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,839
Five, six, seven.

667
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,619
Holy shrap.

668
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,999
Good evening, Nora West-Allen.

669
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,199
Um, hi.

670
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,069
Uh...

671
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,460
You know who I am?

672
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,790
Of course. Nora West-Allen.

673
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,139
Daughter of Iris West and Barry Allen,

674
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,439
also known as the Flash.

675
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,149
Wh...

676
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,149
S... Did you...

677
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:52,519
Did you just say my father, Barry Allen,

678
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,380
was the Flash?

679
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,359
Would you like me to
play your video message,

680
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,629
Nora West-Allen?

681
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,540
My... My message?

682
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:04,299
Yes, from your father, Barry Allen.

683
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,620
Uh, y... yes.

684
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,909
Nora,

685
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,439
I don't have much time.

686
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,949
If you're watching this,
it means you're like me.

687
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,249
You have powers.

688
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,639
It also means I wasn't
there to help you learn

689
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,020
how to use them.

690
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:30,999
I wasn't there for a lot of things.

691
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,560
Remember, my sweet Nora,

692
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:40,399
always remember, I love you.

693
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,039
I always will.

694
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:59,479
I just wanted to see you, Dad.

695
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,129
Thawne...

696
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,080
showed me how.

697
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,080
And Cicada?

698
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,879
The one case we both couldn't solve.

699
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,979
It was my idea to come
here and make it right.

700
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,679
Okay.

701
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:28,019
Can I have a minute alone with Nora?

702
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,519
Of course.

703
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:47,169
How many times did you
go back to Thawne?

704
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,579
How many times?

705
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,180
After the night of the Enlightenment.

706
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,940
Five, uh, maybe six.

707
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,200
Even knowing he killed my mother?

708
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:02,979
- Dad...
- I understand...

709
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,160
coming back to meet me...

710
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,620
and the team.

711
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,479
I do.

712
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,139
I even understand going to Thawne...

713
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,909
to learn how to do it, but...

714
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,840
you kept going back.

715
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,249
Even after you knew what he did.

716
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:24,800
Even after he wasn't your
only option anymore.

717
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:29,040
And the worst part is, you
lied to us every time.

718
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,599
D-Dad, I...

719
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,399
I don't trust you, Nora.

720
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:37,849
I can't have anybody here with us

721
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:40,920
that I don't trust anymore.

722
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,389
W-what are you saying?

723
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:47,380
It's time for you to go home.

724
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,110
Dad, please don't do this!

725
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,460
I promise I will never see Thawne again!

726
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,710
Dad, don't do this!

727
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,609
Nora, if you try to run
back in time again,

728
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,279
I will feel it in the Speed Force.

729
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,980
I'll know.

730
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,679
Good-bye, Nora.

731
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,439
So she finally came clean.

732
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,160
Or did you figure it
out all by yourself?

733
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,040
One wasn't enough?

734
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:49,579
You had to try to take
my daughter from me too?

735
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,729
My daughter!

736
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,480
I knew you'd react like this.

737
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,999
You're always so emotional,

738
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,560
which is why I had her
keep all of this from you.

739
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,119
You can't blame the
Little Runner, Barry.

740
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,969
She just wanted to spend
some time with her dad.

741
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,060
Don't hold that against her.

742
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:15,240
Consider it a condemned
man's last request.

743
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,319
You always thought you were

744
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,399
so much smarter than us, Thawne.

745
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,579
But you lost.

746
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,659
And now you're finally gonna
get what you deserve.

747
