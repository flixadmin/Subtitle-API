1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:19,254 --> 00:00:22,090
This is one of the
largest and most mysterious plane crashes

3
00:00:22,299 --> 00:00:23,633
in Colombian history.

4
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:26,970
It may have been a bomb
that blew up a plane in Colombia today.

5
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:29,181
The Boeing 727 of Avianca Airlines...

6
00:00:34,853 --> 00:00:36,479
In his unsuccessful attempt

7
00:00:36,562 --> 00:00:39,732
to assassinate presidential candidate
César Gaviria,

8
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:42,902
Pablo Escobar murdered
107 innocent people.

9
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:47,657
The "Paisa Robin Hood"...
had become a terrorist.

10
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:52,162
But American intelligence authorities

11
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:55,915
say the drug bosses in Colombia
have to be considered prime suspects.

12
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:06,134
You know where Jaime is?

13
00:01:06,218 --> 00:01:09,262
No, sir.
I don't know where he is.

14
00:01:10,389 --> 00:01:12,015
He left home and hasn't returned.

15
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:15,435
- Have Pablo and his men come by here?
- No.

16
00:01:15,518 --> 00:01:17,812
- Your name is Natalie?
- Yes, sir.

17
00:01:17,896 --> 00:01:21,900
Natalie, your boyfriend, Jaime,
was he with Pablo's sicarios?

18
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:24,652
- No.
- Are you sure?

19
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:26,487
Yes, sir.

20
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:29,949
Well, then, why do you have
this picture of Pablo in your house?

21
00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:34,829
Nothing wrong with that.
Everyone in the comuna has one.

22
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,124
You think those thugs
are going to protect you?

23
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:42,754
You don't understand...
that you represent a big problem for them.

24
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:45,465
We can help you.

25
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:49,802
We can protect you.
But you have to tell us the truth.

26
00:01:59,104 --> 00:02:00,688
She's lying.

27
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:04,650
He's got this poor sucker to carry a bomb
without him even knowing it.

28
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:08,780
- Well, maybe he knew.
- I don't care if he knew or not.

29
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:10,865
It's time we put a bullet in Escobar.

30
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:17,997
I don't want
to leave, my love. I don't want to leave.

31
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:20,917
But I must, for all our safety.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,877
Did you do something wrong?

33
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:28,800
Your dad did nothing wrong.

34
00:02:31,636 --> 00:02:37,683
These are people who are jealous of us,
who are trying to take what we have.

35
00:02:38,518 --> 00:02:40,270
You have to be strong.

36
00:02:41,938 --> 00:02:44,524
I want you to be strong.

37
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:48,194
You have to be strong
and never show weakness.

38
00:02:48,278 --> 00:02:50,155
I promise I'll never be weak.

39
00:02:52,324 --> 00:02:54,742
And watch out for your sister.

40
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,460
I love you very much.

41
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:07,839
I love you all very much.

42
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:10,800
- Mama.
- Pablo?

43
00:03:10,883 --> 00:03:14,595
- Do not spoil this boy.
- But... what do you mean?

44
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:19,809
- Watch her.
- Just a few sweets and some pork rinds.

45
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:30,736
Be careful, son. Be careful.

46
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,918
- I love you.
- Me, too.

47
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,005
Take care.

48
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:52,592
And what about you?

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,720
Come on.
I'm going to take you with me.

50
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:59,432
I'm going to take you with me...
I'm going to take you with me.

51
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:15,865
Take care.

52
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,416
You think he did it?

53
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:26,543
Surely not.

54
00:04:28,878 --> 00:04:30,963
Blow up that plane?

55
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:35,968
Of course he did it, Hermilda.

56
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:38,012
But he had his reasons.

57
00:04:41,558 --> 00:04:46,145
We've got everyone looking
for Jaime's wife throughout the comunas.

58
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,483
I want you to find her and kill her.

59
00:04:51,484 --> 00:04:55,196
And kill any motherfucker that
can connect me with that fucking plane.

60
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:57,823
Yes, sir.

61
00:06:36,756 --> 00:06:39,925
The functions
of President of Colombia?

62
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:41,427
I swear.

63
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:47,808
The Avianca bombing created
a tidal wave of support for César Gaviria.

64
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,357
He became the 28th President of Colombia
by a landslide.

65
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:02,407
Well, César, congratulations.

66
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,283
Not César... I mean, Mr. President.

67
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:05,868
Salud.

68
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:07,203
- Salud.
- Salud.

69
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:08,454
Excuse us.

70
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,127
- As a former president to a new one...
- Mm-hm?

71
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:17,380
What advice would you give?

72
00:07:17,463 --> 00:07:23,135
Well... you'll be asked
to make many difficult decisions.

73
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:26,431
I would say one thing...
do what your wife says.

74
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:28,933
I always do.

75
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:38,443
Trust your instincts,
and be confident in your decisions.

76
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:39,902
Yes...

77
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:43,740
but that's easier said than done.

78
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:46,075
You'll never be able to please everyone,

79
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:48,661
so find the solution
that rings true in your heart.

80
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:49,912
Thank you.

81
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:52,665
Another thing I did want to tell you,
about the Americans...

82
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:54,709
What about the Americans?

83
00:07:55,794 --> 00:07:59,672
This will have to be off the record,
my dear.

84
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:03,635
I can't have my opinions
broadcast on your television show.

85
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:05,720
No, no, no. You have my word.

86
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:09,265
- The Americans...
- Yes?

87
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:11,684
Be careful.

88
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:15,896
We killed José Rodríguez
Gacha with a minimal loss of life.

89
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:20,568
Bringing Escobar to justice
is my number one priority.

90
00:08:20,652 --> 00:08:24,905
But we will do so
on our own terms and own resources.

91
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:26,658
We wanna help you catch Escobar.

92
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:30,745
I have enormous gratitude to you,
especially with Agent Murphy,

93
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:32,580
whose warnings kept me off that plane.

94
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,750
You, sir, yes. Unfortunately,
not the rest of the passengers.

95
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:40,087
The people in Colombia are horrified
about the bombing of Avianca's plane.

96
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:44,550
But they're also against
American soldiers on our soil

97
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:47,219
and spy planes intercepting calls, so...

98
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:50,389
America doesn't intercept
civilian phone calls. That's absurd.

99
00:08:50,473 --> 00:08:53,976
Presidente, you need
additional resources to get this man.

100
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,521
Well...

101
00:08:57,522 --> 00:09:00,232
your government's research says...

102
00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:06,739
660 tons of cocaine were consumed
in the United States last year.

103
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:13,078
Perhaps if your resources
were focused at home,

104
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:14,497
we'd all be better off.

105
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,251
Gaviria made good
on his promise to go after Escobar.

106
00:09:22,922 --> 00:09:26,885
Colonel Carrillo's Search Bloc
was set loose with a vengeance.

107
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,638
Carrillo mounted dozens of raids.

108
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:36,936
But with an army of informants,
Escobar somehow always got away.

109
00:09:38,563 --> 00:09:42,107
We sat on the sidelines,
hands tied by bureaucracy.

110
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:48,447
In response, Pablo took
his narco-terrorism to a whole new level

111
00:09:48,531 --> 00:09:52,493
with a bombing campaign that would
shake the country to its foundations.

112
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:58,332
In doing his best to avoid war,
that's exactly what Gaviria got.

113
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,878
And the toll on both sides
was devastating.

114
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:06,758
The thing about war is...
it's just bad for business.

115
00:10:08,092 --> 00:10:12,304
And when you got a bull's-eye
on your back... your rivals get bold.

116
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:17,184
- Pablo.
- What's up, Pacho?

117
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:18,728
That's right.

118
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:21,773
Pablo and the Medellín cartel
weren't the only game in town.

119
00:10:21,856 --> 00:10:23,566
Thank you.

120
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:28,571
This is Helmer "Pacho" Herrera, one
of the four leaders of the Cali cartel.

121
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:32,784
While Pablo left a trail of bodies
and chaos in his wake,

122
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:36,913
Cali made problems disappear with an army
of lawyers and a mountain of legal briefs.

123
00:10:38,247 --> 00:10:40,332
The Medellín cartel was Miami:

124
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:44,503
swimming pools, bikini girls...
tacky as a two-tone Cadillac.

125
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:47,506
The Cali cartel was New York:

126
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,468
elegant, smooth, subtle.

127
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:53,596
Where they could fuel
the 24-hour nightlife with cocaine,

128
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,142
and still make sure everybody showed up
for work on Wall Street the next morning.

129
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,562
At first, Medellín and Cali
worked side by side.

130
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,692
But in Colombia, when money's involved,
blood inevitably flows.

131
00:11:07,693 --> 00:11:10,863
There had been violence
between Medellín and Cali before.

132
00:11:10,947 --> 00:11:14,659
But right now, a war on two fronts
was not something Pablo could afford.

133
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:19,998
We have Miami...
and have left you alone in New York.

134
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,668
- Yes, for a price.
- Certainly.

135
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:29,173
Look, Pacho, we agreed that we would
share the Los Angeles territory...

136
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,843
and that hasn't been happening.

137
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:35,638
It seems you are not
holding up our agreement.

138
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:39,350
- How's that?
- Exactly what I'm saying, Pacho.

139
00:11:44,897 --> 00:11:46,398
Look, Pablo...

140
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:51,487
you know that our partners
sometimes operate independently.

141
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,740
If Mr. Galeano
and Mr. Moncada are correct,

142
00:11:54,824 --> 00:11:57,910
then you have my assurance
that it will be rectified.

143
00:11:58,036 --> 00:11:59,411
Thanks a lot, Pacho.

144
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,624
Disputes between us
cause needless bloodshed.

145
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:09,421
Then fix it. A war between our groups
is the last thing we need right now.

146
00:12:11,382 --> 00:12:13,634
It would seem you already have a war.

147
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:17,262
Maybe bombing that plane
was a step too far.

148
00:12:19,348 --> 00:12:20,892
Careful, Pacho.

149
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:22,768
Careful.
The only difference between us

150
00:12:22,852 --> 00:12:25,354
is our little misunderstanding
with the government.

151
00:12:25,437 --> 00:12:27,231
And that will be resolved soon.

152
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:29,400
Besides, that's the business,
for all of us.

153
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:31,360
- Yes, it's true for all of us.
- Mm-hm.

154
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:34,655
The only war we are really fighting
is the war against extradition.

155
00:12:34,864 --> 00:12:37,199
And the outcome of that
is something we're all interested in.

156
00:12:37,282 --> 00:12:40,619
It's true, Gustavo.
Gustavo is right.

157
00:12:40,703 --> 00:12:44,123
We have a common goal,
and that is to get rid of extradition.

158
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:48,711
The United States is big enough
for all of us to operate in.

159
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:53,799
Let's figure out Los Angeles
once you take care of your business here.

160
00:12:58,512 --> 00:12:59,805
You know what bothers me?

161
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,684
Your arrogance.

162
00:13:04,643 --> 00:13:06,979
Your attitude, your air of superiority.

163
00:13:08,773 --> 00:13:14,737
Careful, Pacho... that you don't
get yourself killed for that.

164
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:26,206
Thank you for coming.

165
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:45,810
- I'm gonna kill that homo bastard.
- Pablo, let me kill him.

166
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:47,145
Stop talking shit, Moncada.

167
00:13:47,352 --> 00:13:51,273
We'll kill that fag later.
Right now, we can't be out in the open.

168
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:55,069
If that son of a bitch
starts selling shit in Los Angeles,

169
00:13:55,153 --> 00:14:01,283
I'm personally gonna put a gun up his ass
and pull the trigger. I swear.

170
00:14:01,492 --> 00:14:03,911
That will make him fall in love with you.

171
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:09,500
We got Escobar's most trusted soldiers:

172
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,503
Poison, La Quica, Sure Shot, Blackie.

173
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:15,422
Cocky, careless motherfuckers.

174
00:14:15,506 --> 00:14:17,591
Now we're hearing about two new guys:

175
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,259
Fernando Galeano and Kiko Moncada,

176
00:14:19,343 --> 00:14:21,553
basically picking up
where Carlos Lehder left off.

177
00:14:21,637 --> 00:14:23,681
Kill the body, the head will die.

178
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:26,475
Without Colombian permission
to put assets in the air, we can't help.

179
00:14:26,684 --> 00:14:30,395
In terms of intercepts, yeah,
but what do you guys got on ground intel?

180
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:32,731
- You mean spies?
- Yes.

181
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:37,611
We don't have any narco assets.

182
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:40,698
Our human intelligence
is limited to communists.

183
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:45,327
Besides, Gaviria doesn't want you
chasing Escobar with CIA spies.

184
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:47,121
But you got satellites
in the sky, right?

185
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:51,000
Yes, but to use them in pursuit of narcos
would be a direct violation

186
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,794
- of the order of our host country.
- Man, you're CIA.

187
00:14:53,878 --> 00:14:55,337
You break rules all the time.

188
00:14:57,256 --> 00:15:01,844
These are aerial photographs of comunas
controlled by Escobar and his associates.

189
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:03,971
- We'll use them to track his men.
- These are aerials.

190
00:15:04,055 --> 00:15:08,017
- We can't track individuals with these.
- Take a look.

191
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,395
The Los Priscos gang controls El Poblado.

192
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:14,732
Here in Santa Cruz, we got the comuna
where they recruited the Avianca bomber.

193
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:18,027
And both places more densely packed
than a Marrakesh bazaar.

194
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,112
So let's take a tip from the Colombians.

195
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:24,075
You notice anything special about these?

196
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:28,370
Search Bloc follows vehicle traffic
in the comunas. You've got...

197
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:34,001
Japanese imports... four-by-fours.
Cars over 40 grand.

198
00:15:36,295 --> 00:15:38,130
Narcos are the only ones
who can afford these cars.

199
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,925
Whenever aerials see these cars,
we know sicarios are inside.

200
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:43,886
- That's right.
- We start tracking these rice rockets,

201
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:46,138
we might be able to get to Escobar.

202
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,194
I think it's up this way.

203
00:16:02,071 --> 00:16:03,572
I don't want to shoot her.

204
00:16:04,406 --> 00:16:07,159
Kill that cute girl?
And the baby, too?

205
00:16:07,243 --> 00:16:10,955
I don't know why the boss
wants us to kill that girl.

206
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:16,627
- What does she know about Avianca anyway?
- Just shut up and follow orders!

207
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:21,673
Does he think
putting a bomb on every corner

208
00:16:21,757 --> 00:16:23,301
is gonna get the police
to quit chasing him?

209
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:26,304
Gustavo, we need to get away,
out of this country.

210
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:32,517
And go where?

211
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:35,771
We'll be treated like criminals
wherever we go.

212
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:42,027
They'll kill him, and you know it.

213
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:45,156
I just hope he doesn't
take you down with him.

214
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:48,408
This isn't our war.

215
00:16:50,452 --> 00:16:53,831
This isn't war. It's negotiation.

216
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:02,047
Don't you understand
what an opportunity this is?

217
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:05,259
He's willing to consider
terms of surrender...

218
00:17:05,343 --> 00:17:07,886
Under what conditions?

219
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,139
My God, he just blew up a plane!

220
00:17:10,222 --> 00:17:12,557
Eduardo, calm down.
Let the man speak.

221
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:18,105
We can end this violence
with dignity. It's good for both sides...

222
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:21,317
Do you realize
how stupid you sound right now?

223
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,609
César, this is absurd.

224
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:24,528
- Eduardo, please...
- This is a farce.

225
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:25,946
Please.

226
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:30,659
Let me deal with this. Please.

227
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:32,995
Fine. Whatever you want.

228
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,585
We can at least begin a discussion, right?

229
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:43,505
Even though you never stated it,

230
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:47,759
surely you'd like
to see the bombings stop.

231
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:52,139
- Yes. Yes, I would.
- Exactly.

232
00:17:52,223 --> 00:17:55,559
So if we begin a dialogue,
they will cease.

233
00:17:55,642 --> 00:18:00,689
That affords us all some time,
including the Search Bloc.

234
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:03,150
Fernando...

235
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:08,822
you saw his money,
and it blinded you to his soul.

236
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:11,075
That son of a bitch has no soul.

237
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:18,623
If telling him we're negotiating

238
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:21,710
allows the bombs to stop
while we find him...

239
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:24,671
then be my guest.

240
00:18:29,718 --> 00:18:33,638
Thank you. Really, thank you.

241
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:25,107
Look, man,
Pablo's turned into a saint.

242
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,525
Of course.

243
00:19:26,608 --> 00:19:30,737
He sends people straight to heaven.

244
00:19:55,554 --> 00:19:59,057
She's not here.
She might have just left.

245
00:20:00,017 --> 00:20:02,102
Let's search the comuna.

246
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,814
Look, Poison, I'm telling you
Pablo is being paranoid.

247
00:20:05,897 --> 00:20:07,941
Careful what you say, son.

248
00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:11,611
One day,
he is going to ask me to kill you.

249
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:15,574
Would you do it?

250
00:20:15,657 --> 00:20:18,369
If he asks me... of course.

251
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,912
There is no way around it.

252
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:24,291
Wouldn't you?

253
00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:33,758
All right, all right,
let's just go find this girl.

254
00:20:33,842 --> 00:20:36,094
We'll look around
and see where she's hiding.

255
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,057
What's wrong?

256
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,559
Here you go.

257
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:44,102
It's OK, Natalie. Don't worry.

258
00:20:44,186 --> 00:20:49,024
Before you know it, we'll get you
some food. Right? Isn't that right?

259
00:20:49,107 --> 00:20:50,275
Thank you.

260
00:21:04,415 --> 00:21:06,458
What then, Fernando?

261
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:09,378
Has the Colombian government
offered a truce?

262
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:13,924
The government
hasn't been willing to offer anything

263
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:15,675
I would consider acceptable.

264
00:21:15,884 --> 00:21:17,469
What did they offer?

265
00:21:18,387 --> 00:21:21,348
They want you to admit...

266
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:24,726
that you're responsible for Avianca.

267
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:27,938
And of course, I told them that...
That we can't even...

268
00:21:28,146 --> 00:21:29,773
Is it that you're not negotiating a thing?

269
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:32,067
No, no, of course I'm negotiating...

270
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:36,280
Then why is Carrillo
stopping every car in the comunas

271
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:39,032
and killing my boys
with the help of the gringos?!

272
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:45,038
Why are the Americans helping them if we
are supposed to be negotiating, Fernando?

273
00:21:47,124 --> 00:21:52,129
Gaviria doesn't want the gringos to know
he's willing to negotiate with you.

274
00:21:54,756 --> 00:21:55,924
That's it.

275
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,765
Be very careful, Fernando.

276
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,354
Yes, Pablo.

277
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:13,733
Yes.

278
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,633
You've got to stop the bombing, Pablo.

279
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:44,181
I don't know what you're thinking anymore.

280
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:49,060
I think we should...

281
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:52,731
reorganize a bit...

282
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:00,364
and start sending our boys out to burn
some houses down and do some damage

283
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:03,367
to politicians and senators
all over the country.

284
00:23:03,575 --> 00:23:08,038
And to the soldiers and cops in our way,
the judges who annoy us

285
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:09,581
and the reporters that watch us,

286
00:23:09,665 --> 00:23:13,669
basically, we have to create a presence so
disruptive they'll want nothing but peace.

287
00:23:13,877 --> 00:23:17,047
That's the only way
we're going to get there.

288
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,719
Is that it? Is that what you want?
A civil war?

289
00:23:24,012 --> 00:23:27,057
- You've gone crazy, asshole.
- We have to fight, brother.

290
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:30,561
Let's put our hearts into this.

291
00:23:32,437 --> 00:23:35,273
And if we all must die, so be it.

292
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:39,570
Well, yes...

293
00:23:42,947 --> 00:23:45,534
The thing is,
I don't want to die yet, Pablo.

294
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,670
Nor do I.

295
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:02,050
But the bombs make the public want peace.

296
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:04,803
And that will influence the politicians.

297
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:20,193
You're the one who says the politicians
don't give a shit about the public.

298
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:25,741
If you want to influence politicians,
you'll have to narrow your focus.

299
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:27,826
You know what I mean?

300
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,246
Gustavo was right.

301
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:34,207
They needed a new strategy,

302
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:37,795
one that brought terror directly
to the people that mattered the most.

303
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:39,463
What about her?

304
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:41,799
No, she is way too much of a princess.

305
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,383
Surely we would have problems with her.

306
00:24:43,592 --> 00:24:45,469
My God, look at that face.

307
00:24:45,677 --> 00:24:49,473
The media is going to love that fox,
right?

308
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:52,517
Sure they will,
but so will our boys.

309
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:54,227
Just think what
they're gonna do to her.

310
00:24:55,312 --> 00:24:56,229
Well...

311
00:24:57,355 --> 00:24:59,941
I say let's start with her...

312
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:09,284
and this fag.

313
00:25:14,873 --> 00:25:16,124
Let's go!

314
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,629
And this cute couple.

315
00:25:24,048 --> 00:25:27,845
When you kill someone, you lose
all your leverage the moment they're dead.

316
00:25:28,804 --> 00:25:31,515
Now, you take someone's children
away from them,

317
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:33,684
you'd be amazed
what they'd do to get them back.

318
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:37,562
Family members of
the most influential people in the country

319
00:25:37,646 --> 00:25:41,441
have been kidnapped
on the very streets they call home.

320
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,361
What does Pablo Escobar want?

321
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:49,199
I'll see you tomorrow on the same channel
for a special report.

322
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:57,290
Is everything all right?

323
00:26:00,043 --> 00:26:02,379
All the victims are my friends.

324
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:20,188
Excuse me.

325
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:27,070
The kidnapping of Francisco Santos,

326
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:29,656
the editor in chief of the most important
newspaper in the nation,

327
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,701
is the latest and most shocking
in a string of kidnappings

328
00:26:32,784 --> 00:26:35,036
orchestrated by the Medellín cartel.

329
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,830
Reporting to you, I'm Valeria Velez.

330
00:26:37,706 --> 00:26:42,335
- All right.
- First on the scene, right? As always.

331
00:26:43,628 --> 00:26:47,632
Maybe if you actually
had to work for a living,

332
00:26:47,716 --> 00:26:50,301
you'd be hungry enough to get here first.

333
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,346
I found out from Santos' wife...

334
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,349
a half hour after
he didn't show up for dinner.

335
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:58,268
You?

336
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:00,353
Who tipped you off?

337
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:03,690
It's a pleasure to see you,
as always.

338
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:28,214
These are Pablo's conditions
for the release of the hostages.

339
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:32,218
You've read them,
you can see they're very reasonable.

340
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:33,720
"Very reasonable," he says.

341
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:37,766
You are definitely an imbecile, Fernando.

342
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:39,851
And I'm going to tell you something.

343
00:27:39,935 --> 00:27:44,147
You will get what you deserve very soon,
I assure you.

344
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:54,198
I'm also one of those hostages.

345
00:27:55,116 --> 00:28:01,623
I myself could be walking around calmly...
but like them, I am not free.

346
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:10,173
Escobar is asking us to surrender,
but that will never happen.

347
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:15,345
If he releases the hostages
and turns himself in,

348
00:28:15,428 --> 00:28:17,889
we will take this into account.

349
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:22,769
Gaviria isn't going to bend.

350
00:28:25,897 --> 00:28:27,941
Then I'm going to break him.

351
00:28:36,157 --> 00:28:38,201
You, get up from there.

352
00:28:47,168 --> 00:28:52,549
The body of Ofelia Hernandez was found
dumped next to the Presidential Palace.

353
00:28:53,341 --> 00:28:56,720
One must admire President Gaviria.
I'm sure it can't be easy for him

354
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:59,931
to stand by his decision
to not negotiate with Escobar.

355
00:29:00,015 --> 00:29:02,433
What's the plan?

356
00:29:05,186 --> 00:29:07,731
A few more hostages and they will give in.

357
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:12,777
Their time is running out.

358
00:29:12,861 --> 00:29:14,654
I'm talking about us.

359
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:18,867
What about us, Valeria?

360
00:29:23,914 --> 00:29:27,208
I don't have time
for that pussy shit right now.

361
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:35,216
Colombia's sweetheart.

362
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:38,636
You know the only reason
this hag has any fame

363
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,847
is because her father was president.

364
00:29:41,932 --> 00:29:44,308
I despise her.

365
00:29:45,852 --> 00:29:47,938
And why do you care so much?

366
00:29:50,481 --> 00:29:53,401
Your ratings are through the roof, right?

367
00:29:53,484 --> 00:29:55,653
Hers are higher.

368
00:30:25,642 --> 00:30:27,268
Open the door, quick!

369
00:30:29,312 --> 00:30:30,438
Move!

370
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,733
Let's go!

371
00:30:33,817 --> 00:30:34,943
Hurry up!

372
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:19,362
Where am I?

373
00:31:22,323 --> 00:31:23,449
Hello!

374
00:31:25,202 --> 00:31:26,703
Tell me where I am.

375
00:31:28,496 --> 00:31:30,623
Does my family know I'm alive?

376
00:31:30,707 --> 00:31:32,209
How would I know?

377
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:37,338
Who are you?

378
00:31:39,257 --> 00:31:41,384
You work for Escobar?

379
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:44,554
You can call me Gorilla.

380
00:31:47,265 --> 00:31:48,099
Gorilla.

381
00:31:50,185 --> 00:31:52,729
Very well... Gorilla.

382
00:31:54,064 --> 00:31:55,523
Where's my crew?

383
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,902
Did you bring them here as well?

384
00:32:00,945 --> 00:32:04,866
I'm here to guard you. That's it.

385
00:32:30,516 --> 00:32:32,685
Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me.

386
00:32:32,894 --> 00:32:36,731
We understand the frustration and pain
you must be feeling for your children,

387
00:32:36,814 --> 00:32:40,610
but believe me,
we are doing everything we can

388
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:42,904
to make sure your children get home soon.

389
00:32:42,987 --> 00:32:45,782
Our daughter was kidnapped
on her way to an interview.

390
00:32:45,865 --> 00:32:49,160
They killed the bodyguard.
No one is safe.

391
00:32:49,244 --> 00:32:54,457
As a former president, I understand
the terrible position you're in.

392
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,336
But we're here to find a solution.

393
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:01,339
I understand your frustration,
Dr. Turbay.

394
00:33:02,257 --> 00:33:08,179
But if we give in now, any criminal
can hold our government hostage.

395
00:33:08,263 --> 00:33:12,475
This isn't "any criminal."
This is the worst criminal in the world.

396
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:14,936
- And he is laughing at all of us.
- Mr. President,

397
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:20,399
you're proceeding as you must, but we must
act as the parents of our children.

398
00:33:20,483 --> 00:33:23,361
Let's pray you find a solution.

399
00:33:25,363 --> 00:33:28,532
A good president
can stand up to external pressure.

400
00:33:28,616 --> 00:33:31,452
It's the internal pressure
that can wear you down.

401
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:37,125
We knew the clock was ticking before
Gaviria had to cave in to Escobar...

402
00:33:38,168 --> 00:33:42,421
but hopefully not before
our unauthorized operation struck gold.

403
00:33:43,256 --> 00:33:47,344
Catching a top sicario could be the break
we needed in leading us to Pablo.

404
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:48,303
Here.

405
00:33:48,511 --> 00:33:52,265
We'd continue to join
in an "observational capacity."

406
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:54,017
Hands up!

407
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,268
Up!

408
00:33:55,352 --> 00:33:57,270
Why are you driving this car?

409
00:33:57,354 --> 00:34:00,982
I don't know. Someone paid me 50,000 pesos
to drive it around the city.

410
00:34:01,065 --> 00:34:03,776
The sicarios had figured out
we were tracking their rides.

411
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,322
So they traded down to junkers
to avoid our eye in the sky.

412
00:34:07,405 --> 00:34:10,449
But we weren't the only ones
that had Pablo in the gun sights.

413
00:34:10,533 --> 00:34:12,327
Pablo came to see me.

414
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,494
Why?

415
00:34:13,577 --> 00:34:16,039
He wants to settle
the dispute we have in the US.

416
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:17,540
The Los Angeles problems.

417
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:20,501
He has bigger issues
than that right now.

418
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:23,046
He'll make a deal with the government.

419
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:27,300
He's managed to secure
some very effective bargaining chips.

420
00:34:27,384 --> 00:34:30,261
Of course,
he'll look after you guys, right?

421
00:34:30,345 --> 00:34:33,806
We haven't talked to Pablo in weeks.
He's in hiding.

422
00:34:35,141 --> 00:34:37,894
Look at that.
What a beautiful animal, Jorge.

423
00:34:37,977 --> 00:34:39,020
You like it?

424
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,147
Yes, of course.

425
00:34:41,231 --> 00:34:45,026
I'm sure he'll look after you.
After all, you're partners.

426
00:34:45,235 --> 00:34:46,944
Yes, of course. Partners.

427
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:56,246
You could always have your sister
put in a good word with Gustavo.

428
00:34:56,329 --> 00:34:58,206
What do you mean?

429
00:34:59,123 --> 00:35:01,459
Oh, I'm sorry,
I thought you knew.

430
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:05,422
It could be gossip.
You know how people like to talk.

431
00:35:13,471 --> 00:35:16,015
You should eat,
because you're going to be here a while.

432
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:17,975
You're going to get very hungry.

433
00:35:19,102 --> 00:35:21,187
I don't feel well.

434
00:35:21,271 --> 00:35:24,941
What's wrong? Are you sick?

435
00:35:25,024 --> 00:35:27,026
I can get you some medicine.

436
00:35:28,569 --> 00:35:31,114
It's not that kind of illness.

437
00:35:32,323 --> 00:35:38,537
I want to congratulate you.
I know you're a very good reporter.

438
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,165
Thank you.

439
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:46,129
Gorilla, how long have you been
working for Escobar?

440
00:35:46,337 --> 00:35:49,924
Oh, it's been a while.

441
00:35:50,007 --> 00:35:53,386
So you know what's going on out there,
don't you?

442
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:58,141
The truth is, I don't go out,
so I have no idea what's happening.

443
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:02,853
What the fuck are you doing, Gorilla?
Why isn't she wearing the blindfold?

444
00:36:02,937 --> 00:36:04,272
I didn't know you were coming.

445
00:36:04,355 --> 00:36:07,566
Put it on, man!
We have to take her.

446
00:36:07,775 --> 00:36:08,818
Put that on.

447
00:36:09,986 --> 00:36:14,031
- Says who?
- Didn't I tell you to stay quiet?

448
00:36:14,115 --> 00:36:15,866
Just put it on.

449
00:36:29,713 --> 00:36:32,550
Pleasure to finally meet you,
Ms. Turbay.

450
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:35,678
Sit down, please.

451
00:37:08,044 --> 00:37:10,254
I suppose you want me to interview you?

452
00:37:11,381 --> 00:37:13,799
No, even better.

453
00:37:13,883 --> 00:37:16,511
I'm going to interview you.

454
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:21,098
So you can tell the world about
the humane treatment you've received here.

455
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:28,772
Don't you want your parents
to know you're well?

456
00:37:30,024 --> 00:37:31,817
That you're alive?

457
00:37:36,947 --> 00:37:40,368
I don't want to become
a piece of propaganda for you.

458
00:37:42,245 --> 00:37:43,704
Who do you think you are?

459
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:53,881
So what's necessary, miss,
to have your cooperation?

460
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:03,933
Let one of the hostages go.

461
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:11,023
You and I know that
I'm the one you really want.

462
00:38:24,995 --> 00:38:26,456
You see?

463
00:38:27,123 --> 00:38:30,793
Two reasonable people
coming to an agreement.

464
00:38:32,169 --> 00:38:37,716
Maybe we can convince President Gaviria
to do the same. Right?

465
00:38:41,638 --> 00:38:45,057
Mr. Escobar has shown
a willingness to negotiate.

466
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:49,604
This afternoon,
he let one of the hostages go.

467
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:51,772
President Gaviria...

468
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:57,487
I ask you to at least
consider discussions with Mr. Escobar.

469
00:39:02,866 --> 00:39:04,201
I don't understand.

470
00:39:04,285 --> 00:39:07,246
I thought you said he wouldn't bend,
but now he's let one go.

471
00:39:07,455 --> 00:39:09,582
Because he has your daughter.

472
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:12,502
And she's worth more to him
than the rest of them combined.

473
00:39:14,211 --> 00:39:18,382
If you knew all I know, you'd understand
it's nothing more than a stunt.

474
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:20,092
Give him what he wants.

475
00:39:20,176 --> 00:39:22,637
What he wants is an insult to us
and to this country.

476
00:39:22,845 --> 00:39:24,555
I don't care. I want my child!

477
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:27,141
What I believe
my wife is trying to say is,

478
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:31,061
we'd like you to make a deal with Escobar.

479
00:39:31,979 --> 00:39:35,441
If you refuse,
we'll have to take certain measures.

480
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:41,989
Financially, by robbing you of donors...
and politically,

481
00:39:42,072 --> 00:39:47,495
by robbing you of whatever support
your legislative agenda needs.

482
00:39:50,914 --> 00:39:52,082
Are you threatening me?

483
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,378
We all use the tools at our disposal.

484
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:59,674
You as a politician, me as a father.
I'm sorry.

485
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,426
Doctor...

486
00:40:03,678 --> 00:40:06,514
you told me to follow my instincts...

487
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:11,018
and they tell me
not to give in to this criminal.

488
00:40:11,227 --> 00:40:13,563
That was before they took my daughter.

489
00:40:58,899 --> 00:41:02,653
I came over as quickly as I could.
I was told you needed me urgently.

490
00:41:02,737 --> 00:41:04,113
What's up?

491
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:07,366
You OK?

492
00:41:11,621 --> 00:41:16,208
Tell Fernando...
I'm willing to open negotiations.

493
00:41:17,918 --> 00:41:21,046
We'll make a counter to Escobar's demands.

494
00:41:21,798 --> 00:41:23,800
I thought you weren't going to negotiate.

495
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,641
I have to stop this madness, Eduardo.

496
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:37,187
But God willing,
we can catch him first.

497
00:41:41,942 --> 00:41:45,154
Tell the Americans
they can put their planes in the air.

498
00:41:49,325 --> 00:41:51,201
And there it was.

499
00:41:51,285 --> 00:41:54,997
Negotiate with a terrorist while
trying to catch him at the same time.

500
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:01,587
Hammer, we have calls
originating in Comuna 3,

501
00:42:01,796 --> 00:42:05,048
Manrique, from known
sicario satellite phones.

502
00:42:05,132 --> 00:42:06,884
Do you have a location?

503
00:42:07,885 --> 00:42:09,178
What?

504
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:11,722
Yes, we're here in Campo Valdés.

505
00:42:13,015 --> 00:42:14,600
Campo Valdés.

506
00:42:14,684 --> 00:42:17,812
That's in the central eastern area,
bordered by the Comuna Popular.

507
00:42:17,895 --> 00:42:19,355
Roger that.

508
00:42:19,438 --> 00:42:20,815
Campo Valdés.

509
00:42:20,898 --> 00:42:23,818
Going into the comunas
without Colombian backup,

510
00:42:23,901 --> 00:42:26,195
that's about the most dangerous
thing you can do.

511
00:42:26,278 --> 00:42:29,156
We're gonna
score a quick goal and then come back out.

512
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:31,367
All right, all right. All right.

513
00:42:31,575 --> 00:42:34,161
That's how bad
we wanted to catch these guys.

514
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,373
Don't kill me, please!

515
00:42:37,456 --> 00:42:41,335
I swear I didn't hear anything!
I'm not going to say anything!

516
00:42:41,418 --> 00:42:43,713
Please, don't kill me.

517
00:42:43,796 --> 00:42:45,548
- I'm not...
- Hey! Hey!

518
00:42:45,756 --> 00:42:49,134
- Please, don't kill me!
- What?

519
00:42:49,218 --> 00:42:52,221
I'm begging you, please...

520
00:42:56,433 --> 00:43:01,522
You could have at least waited till
I got her off me. Look at me now! Huh?

521
00:43:01,605 --> 00:43:03,733
You got blood all over my new shoes.

522
00:43:03,816 --> 00:43:07,027
I don't give a shit about your shoes.
Stop bitching.

523
00:43:08,237 --> 00:43:09,530
I'm not.

524
00:43:10,865 --> 00:43:11,824
What about her?

525
00:43:18,414 --> 00:43:19,790
Put a bullet in her.

526
00:43:25,588 --> 00:43:27,965
What? The baby's not a witness, man.

527
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:30,217
I don't give a shit.

528
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,053
- Pablo told us to kill everyone.
- Yeah, but it's a baby.

529
00:43:33,136 --> 00:43:35,389
She won't say shit in court.

530
00:43:36,223 --> 00:43:38,935
If she grows up and talks?

531
00:43:39,017 --> 00:43:42,396
Really? Do you remember
what your mom told you when you were two?

532
00:43:42,605 --> 00:43:48,444
Why is it so fucking difficult
for you to follow Pablo's orders? Huh?

533
00:45:46,478 --> 00:45:48,772
Drop the gun.

534
00:45:49,565 --> 00:45:51,191
Now!

535
00:45:58,657 --> 00:46:01,451
You're under arrest,
you son of a bitch.

536
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,703
Let him go!

537
00:46:13,005 --> 00:46:14,006
Let him go!

538
00:46:14,214 --> 00:46:16,466
- Put the gun down.
- You put yours down.

539
00:46:17,718 --> 00:46:19,636
I don't want to have to kill you.

540
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:21,805
I will.

541
00:46:46,246 --> 00:46:48,290
Fuck.

542
00:46:57,424 --> 00:46:58,550
Fuck!

543
00:47:41,301 --> 00:47:42,719
Hey.

544
00:47:42,928 --> 00:47:45,764
Hey...

545
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:10,789
So those fags want to sit and negotiate.

546
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:13,792
Well...

547
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,880
we have to spend some time in jail, right?

548
00:48:17,963 --> 00:48:19,756
So what the fuck.

549
00:48:21,133 --> 00:48:23,760
You won, Pablo. They gave in.

550
00:48:23,844 --> 00:48:29,141
But that faggot president has yet
to accept our most important demand

551
00:48:29,225 --> 00:48:30,893
before we turn ourselves in.

552
00:48:31,685 --> 00:48:33,311
Which demand is that?

553
00:48:38,608 --> 00:48:40,652
It's been a while
since we've been up here, right?

554
00:48:40,736 --> 00:48:41,778
Yeah.

555
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:47,492
We used to come up here
with our girlfriends and smoke a joint.

556
00:48:49,745 --> 00:48:51,955
What does that have to do with anything?

557
00:48:57,753 --> 00:49:01,381
I know every centimeter
of these mountains.

558
00:49:03,008 --> 00:49:06,720
From here,
we can see anything coming.

559
00:49:06,803 --> 00:49:10,432
And we have enough space
to build whatever we want.

560
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:14,978
We're going to design it...

561
00:49:17,189 --> 00:49:19,108
we're going to build it...

562
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:24,362
and we will be protected
from all our enemies.

563
00:49:26,615 --> 00:49:30,160
- You want to build a jail?
- Not a jail, cousin.

564
00:49:32,246 --> 00:49:33,872
A castle.
