1
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,038
Grey worm: (Reading) "My name

2
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,166
"is grey worm.

3
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,211
"I come from

4
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,881
"the summer iiis."

5
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,841
Missandei: "Isles."

6
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,761
"Summer isles."

7
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,930
Grey worm: "Summer isles."

8
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,893
(Both speaking valyrian)

9
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,358
I am from an island called naath.

10
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:30,692
(Grey worm speaking valyrian)

11
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,321
When they took you?

12
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,157
When did they take me?

13
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,537
I was five years old.

14
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,581
You remember your home?

15
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,086
I remember
when they rowed us away from shore.

16
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,341
How white the beaches were.

17
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,428
How tall the trees.

18
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,475
And I remember my village burning.

19
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,854
Smoke rising into the sky.

20
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,322
Do you remember your home?

21
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,368
Unsumed.

22
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,787
Always unsullied.

23
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,082
Before unsullied, nothing.

24
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,959
That's not true.

25
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,797
Perhaps one day
you will return to the summer isles.

26
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,757
I don't want return.

27
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,468
(Speaking valyrian)

28
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,639
"Kill the masters."

29
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,766
Kill the masters.

30
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,770
Daenerys: How are the lessons coming?

31
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,940
Missandei: Very well, your grace.

32
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,026
Missandei is teacher good, my queen.

33
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,781
You'll have to continue later.

34
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,161
It's time.

35
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,654
(Grunting)

36
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,272
You heard her!

37
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,150
She said she came to free us!

38
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,402
You're a fool.

39
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,821
The masters are too strong.

40
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,531
She will protect us.

41
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,325
She defeated the masters' champion.

42
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,410
(Slaves murmuring)

43
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,664
She has a great army.

44
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,418
You want to live the rest of your days
in chains?

45
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,711
I want to live.

46
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,755
You saw what they did to those children.

47
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,259
What do you think they'll do to us?

48
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,220
I've been through two slave revolts, boy.

49
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,972
They always end the same way:

50
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,934
The masters in power and the slaves dead.

51
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,894
All men must die.

52
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,774
But I promise you,

53
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,988
a single day of freedom is worth
more than a lifetime in chains.

54
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,782
Who are you?

55
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,451
This one is called grey worm.

56
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,914
I was taken as a baby
by the masters of astapor,

57
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,667
raised and trained as unsullied.

58
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,212
Now I fight for Daenerys,

59
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,464
the mother of dragons

60
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,467
and breaker of chains.

61
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,595
You are unsullied?

62
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,307
They taught you how to fight
before you could walk.

63
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,310
We are not soldiers!

64
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,686
We have no training,

65
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,021
no weapons.

66
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,318
(Weapons clattering)

67
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,751
There are three slaves in
this city for every master.

68
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,005
No one can give you your freedom, brothers.

69
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,883
If you want it,

70
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,927
you must take it.

71
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,317
(All speaking valyrian)

72
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,998
(Footsteps approaching)

73
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,753
(Gasps)

74
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,342
(Slaves chanting in valyrian)

75
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,389
(Screaming)

76
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,143
Slaves: (Chanting) Mhysal

77
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,858
(chanting continues)

78
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,718
(Chanting continues)

79
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,893
Slaves: (Chanting) Mhysal

80
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,441
Daenerys: Remind me, ser jorah,

81
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:48,194
how many children
did the great masters nail to mileposts?

82
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,363
163, khaleesi.

83
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,324
That was it.

84
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,915
(Shouts in valyrian)

85
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,335
Barristan: Your grace, may I have a word?

86
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,468
The city is yours.

87
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,970
All these people,
they're your subjects now.

88
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,726
Sometimes it is better to
answer injustice with mercy.

89
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,813
I will answer injustice with justice.

90
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,029
(Master groaning)

91
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,910
(Screaming)

92
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,331
(Groans)

93
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,673
(Masters screaming)

94
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,969
(Screams echoing)

95
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,527
(Swords clan king)

96
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,699
(Panting)

97
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,975
(Groaning)

98
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,811
What the hell was that?

99
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:49,357
That was me knocking your arse
to the dirt with your own hand.

100
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:53,862
You're a rare talent.

101
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,781
When you're fighting cripples, anyway.

102
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,410
You learned to fight
like a good little boy.

103
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,746
I'll bet that thrust through the mad
king's back was pretty as a picture.

104
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,124
You want to fight pretty
or you want to win?

105
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,834
You talk to my brother this way?

106
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,460
All the time.

107
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,671
He got used to it.

108
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,796
Jaime: Do you think he did it?

109
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,187
Oh, he hated the little twat, sure.

110
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,271
But who didn't?

111
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,691
And poison's not his style.

112
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,611
Or murder.

113
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,449
You want to know for sure,
why don't you ask him?

114
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,101
You haven't been to see him yet, eh?

115
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,208
We're done for today.

116
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,537
Your brother ever tell you
how I came into his service?

117
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,342
You stood for him in
his trial by combat at the eyrie.

118
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:03,181
But only when lady arryn
demanded the trial take place that day.

119
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,642
You were his first choice.

120
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,061
He named you for his champion

121
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,564
because he knew you would ride
day and night to come fight for him.

122
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,943
You gonna fight for him now?

123
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,954
Jaime: To tell you the
truth, this isn't so bad.

124
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:29,207
Four walls. A pot to piss in.

125
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,462
I was chained to a wooden post
covered in my own shit for months.

126
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,009
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

127
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,511
Maybe a bit.

128
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,421
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.

129
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,018
It's complicated.

130
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,896
So how is our sister?

131
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,064
How do you think?

132
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,566
Her son died in her arms.

133
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,859
Herson?

134
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,578
- You know what's coming?
- Hmm.

135
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,415
My trial for regicide.

136
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,503
I know
the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty,

137
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,672
that one of my three judges

138
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,216
has wished me dead
more times than I can count.

139
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,427
And thatjudge is my father.

140
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,471
As for Cersei,

141
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,682
well, she's probably working on a way

142
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,976
to avoid a trial altogether
by having me killed.

143
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,229
She did ask.

144
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,316
So, should I turn around and close my eyes?

145
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:37,900
Depends.

146
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,861
Did you do it?

147
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,573
The kingslayer brothers. You like it?

148
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,783
I like it.

149
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,413
You're really asking if I killed your son?

150
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,875
Are you really asking
if I'd kill my brother?

151
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,297
How can I help you?

152
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,799
You could set me free.

153
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,927
You know I can't.

154
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,181
Then there's really nothing else to say.

155
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,683
What do you want me to do? Kill the guards?

156
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,647
Sneak you out of the city
in the back of a cart?

157
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,325
I'm the lord commander of the kingsguard.

158
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,897
Sorry, I'd forgotten.

159
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,024
I'd hate for you to do
something inappropriate.

160
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,442
Inappropriate?

161
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,528
You're accused of killing the king.
Freeing you is treason.

162
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,530
Except I didn't do it.

163
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,366
Which is why we're having a trial.

164
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,450
Oh!

165
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,035
A trial.

166
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,829
If the killer threw himself
before the iron throne,

167
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:36,042
confessed to his crimes,
and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt,

168
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,502
it wouldn't matter to Cersei.

169
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,463
She won't rest until my head's on a spike.

170
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,798
Not just yours.

171
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,968
She's offering a knighthood to
whomever finds sansa stark.

172
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,720
Sansa couldn't have done this.

173
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,306
She had more reason than
anyone in the seven kingdoms.

174
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,682
Do you think it's a coincidence

175
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,452
she disappeared the
same night Joffrey died?

176
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:54,644
No, but

177
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,106
sansa's not a killer.

178
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,318
Not yet, anyway.

179
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:03,945
(Wood creaking)

180
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,571
(Men shouting)

181
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,786
(Footsteps approaching)

182
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,084
Where are you taking me?

183
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,128
I'm getting married to your aunt lysa.

184
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,380
She's waiting for us at the eyrie.

185
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,298
You'll be safe there.

186
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,855
Did you kill Joffrey?

187
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,732
Did I kill Joffrey?

188
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,361
I've been in the vale for weeks.

189
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,696
I know it was you.

190
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,366
And who helped me with this conspiracy?

191
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,495
There was ser dontos.

192
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,581
You used him to get me
out of king's landing,

193
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,333
but you would never
trust him to kill the king.

194
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,877
Why not?

195
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,640
Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.

196
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,381
Then perhaps it was your husband.

197
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,969
How do you know?

198
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,554
I just do.

199
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,933
You're right.
He wasn't involved in Joffrey's death.

200
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,144
But you were.

201
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,940
Do you remember
that lovely necklace dontos gave you?

202
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:28,613
I don't suppose you noticed
that a stone was missing after the feast.

203
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:31,908
The poison.

204
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,953
I don't understand.

205
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,539
The lannisters gave you wealth, power.

206
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,416
Joffrey made you the lord of harrenhal.

207
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,711
A man with no motive
is a man no one suspects.

208
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,255
Always keep your foes confused.

209
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:50,009
If they don't know who
you are or what you want,

210
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,136
they can't know what you plan to do next.

211
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,475
I don't believe you.

212
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,686
If they catch you, they'll put your head

213
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,730
on a spike just like my father's.

214
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,900
You'd risk that just to confuse them?

215
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,988
So many men, they risk so little.

216
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,200
They spend their lives avoiding danger.

217
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,494
And then they die.

218
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,457
I'd risk everything to get what I want.

219
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,710
And what do you want?

220
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,218
Everything.

221
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,765
My friendship
with the lannisters was productive.

222
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,183
But Joffrey,

223
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,981
a vicious boy with a crown on his head,
is not a reliable ally.

224
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,233
And who could trust a friend like that?

225
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,527
Who could trust you?

226
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,281
I don't want friends like me.

227
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,658
My new friends are predictable.

228
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,243
Very reasonable people.

229
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,496
As for what happened to Joffrey,

230
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:04,333
that was something
my new friends wanted very badly.

231
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,877
Nothing like a thoughtful gift

232
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,171
to make a new friendship grow strong.

233
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,674
Margaery: I can't believe you're going.

234
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,427
Leaving me alone here with these people.

235
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,554
Olenna: The time has come, my dear.

236
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,473
There's nothing more tedious than a trial.

237
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,892
Except perhaps these gardens.

238
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,563
If I have to take one more leisurely stroll
through these gardens,

239
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,065
I'll fling myself from the cliffs.

240
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,442
(Margaery laughs)

241
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,125
Olenna: Have you been to see tommen yet?

242
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:37,283
Have they even agreed to the match?
No one tells me anything.

243
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:41,287
I wasn't originally meant to
marry your grandfather Luthor.

244
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,499
He was engaged to my sister,
your great-aunt viola.

245
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,378
I was to be given to
some Targaryen or other.

246
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,256
Marrying a Targaryen
was all the rage back then.

247
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,052
But the moment I saw my intended,

248
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,971
with his twitchy little ferret's face

249
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,224
and ludicrous silver hair,
I knew he wouldn't do.

250
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,606
So the evening
before Luthor was to propose to my sister,

251
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,484
I got lost on my way back
from my embroidery lesson

252
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,903
and happened upon his chamber.

253
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,196
(Laughs)

254
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,614
How absentminded of me.

255
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,199
Mmm-hmm.

256
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,661
The following morning,
Luthor never made it down the stairs

257
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:25,122
to propose to my sister
'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.

258
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,750
And once he could, the only thing he wanted

259
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,086
was what I'd given him the night before.

260
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,213
I was good.

261
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,715
I was very good.

262
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,303
You are even better.

263
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,222
But you need to act quickly.

264
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:45,226
Cersei may be vicious,
but she's not stupid.

265
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,354
She'll turn the boy against you
as soon as she can.

266
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,524
And by the time you're married,
it'll be too late.

267
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,109
Luckily for you, the queen regent

268
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,694
is rather distracted at the moment.

269
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,655
Mourning her dear departed boy.

270
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,784
Accusing her brother of his murder,
which he didn't commit.

271
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,369
He could have done.

272
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,204
But he didn't.

273
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,706
You don't know, grandmother.

274
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,249
But I do know.

275
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,628
You don't think
I'd let you marry that beast, do you?

276
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,756
What? I don't understand.

277
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,466
Shh.

278
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,928
Don't you worry yourself about all that.

279
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,349
You just do what needs to be done.

280
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,644
Jon: Bring it through!

281
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,272
(Swords clanging)

282
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,320
And again.

283
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,578
(Laughs)

284
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,288
Very nice. Good.

285
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,332
A lot of wildlings fight
with a weapon in each hand.

286
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,169
First thing you want to do

287
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,338
is disarm them to try and even the odds.

288
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,513
(Both grunting)

289
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,353
Let's see what you can do.

290
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,191
Olly, you just watch for now.

291
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:16,484
I can fight.

292
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,527
Have you ever held a sword before?

293
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,071
I was the best Archer in our Hamlet.

294
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,199
- (Men laughing)
- I was!

295
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,326
I believe you.

296
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,952
We'll go hunting for rabbits one day.

297
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,537
Right now, watch and learn.

298
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,500
You two.

299
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,128
Take it slow, try and disarm each other.

300
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,721
(Shouts)

301
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,934
(Groans)

302
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,615
You know how to fight.

303
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,242
You could have gone easier on him.

304
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,921
He wouldn't have learned anything that way.

305
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,247
Alliser: Lord snow.

306
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,500
What do you think you're doing?

307
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,919
Grenn and I were helping them.

308
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,754
Grenn's a ranger. You're a steward.

309
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,216
Maybe you forgot that while you
were off with your wildling bitch,

310
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,300
but I didn't.

311
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,428
Someone has to train them.

312
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,430
And that someone isn't you.

313
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,599
Go find a chamber pot to empty.

314
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,437
Go on. Do it.

315
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,440
You traitor's bastard.

316
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,192
Give me an excuse.

317
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,945
Mormont's not here to protect you now.

318
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,083
Get back to work.

319
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:57,751
Now!

320
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,046
I said now!

321
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:07,469
The bastard's well-liked. You're not.

322
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,389
You think I care if they
like me? We're at war.

323
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,141
For now.

324
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,602
But you can't be acting commander forever.

325
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:16,562
There will be a choosing.

326
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,230
The old maester will insist on it.

327
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:22,818
You might reconsider his request
to march on craster's.

328
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,906
Let the mutineers take care of snow.

329
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,993
Or you might be taking orders from him
the rest of your life.

330
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,135
A bastard, eh?

331
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,221
Took you for highborn.

332
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,058
My father was highborn.

333
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,769
My mother wasn't.

334
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,106
Name's Locke.

335
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,235
Jon snow.

336
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:09,823
You fight well.

337
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,700
What brought you up here?

338
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,369
A sense of duty.

339
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:16,121
I wanted to do my part
for the safety of the realm.

340
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,124
(Laughing)

341
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,503
I was a game warden in the stormlands.

342
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,005
Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids.

343
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,882
I was stupid enough to get caught.

344
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,051
Chose the wall over losing my hand.

345
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:32,596
Figured I wouldn't have to
suck up to any highborn cunts here.

346
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:34,431
Alliser: Come on, get on with it.

347
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,934
What are you waiting for? Summer?

348
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,060
Guess I was wrong.

349
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,191
(Knocking on door)

350
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,833
You sent for me, your grace?

351
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,043
Your grace.

352
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:04,795
How formal of you.

353
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:09,466
How many kingsguards
are posted outside tommen's door?

354
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,846
Ser boros is on duty tonight.
Tomorrow I believe...

355
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,139
So one?

356
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,393
You have one man guarding the future king?

357
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,687
I promise you tommen's safe.

358
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,855
We're protecting him.

359
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,108
The way you protected Joffrey?

360
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,862
Why did catelyn stark set you free?

361
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,196
What?

362
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,573
I've been wondering for months.

363
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:36,785
Ever since that great cow
brought you back to the capital.

364
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,996
Why did she set you free?

365
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,874
You know why. She'd hoped
I'd send her daughters back to her.

366
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,089
She hoped or did you promise?

367
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,799
I swore by all the gods

368
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,111
that if her daughters were alive,
I'd return them to her.

369
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:56,180
So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.

370
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,390
I wanted to get back to you.

371
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:00,833
Should I have told her to fuck off?

372
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,978
You didn't mean it, then?

373
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,898
You have no loyalty to catelyn stark?

374
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,691
Catelyn stark's dead.

375
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:10,255
So if I told you to leave the
capital right now and find sansa,

376
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,323
if I told you to find that
murderous little bitch

377
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,325
and bring me her head,

378
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,368
would you do it?

379
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,167
I know you went to see Tyrion.

380
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:31,465
That creature who murdered our son.

381
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,011
I had to see him.

382
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,513
I had to know for myself.

383
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,389
And?

384
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,769
He didn't do it, Cersei.

385
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,271
You've always pitied him.

386
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,525
Our poor little brother.

387
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:53,529
Abused by the world,
despised by his father and sister.

388
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,573
He'd kill us all if he could.

389
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,746
I want four men at tommen's door
day and night.

390
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,000
That will be all, lord commander.

391
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,968
(Door opens)

392
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,113
(Sighs)

393
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,284
(Door opens)

394
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,412
Ser pounce?

395
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,543
(Door creaks)

396
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,547
(Door closes)

397
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,553
Tommen: How did you
get past the kingsguard?

398
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,430
Kingsguard.

399
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,768
I don't think you're supposed to be here.

400
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,063
Mother doesn't allow me
to have visitors at night.

401
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,274
I'm not a visitor, your grace.

402
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,444
Word has it I'm to be your bride.

403
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,368
Did you know that people
in arranged marriages

404
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,288
often never meet until their wedding day?

405
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:32,544
Before we decide to
spend our lives together,

406
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,922
we ought to get to know one another.

407
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,506
Don't you think?

408
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,135
Yes.

409
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,671
But if my mother found out...

410
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,805
It can be our secret.

411
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,478
If we're going to be man and wife,

412
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,148
we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope.

413
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,903
So, your grace...

414
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,655
Yes?

415
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,033
Tell me a secret.

416
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,829
(Ser pounce meows)

417
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:08,997
(Margaery laughs)

418
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,584
Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?

419
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,711
That's ser pounce.

420
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,047
Very handsome.

421
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:20,717
Joffrey didn't like him.

422
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,220
He threatened to skin him alive

423
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,138
and mix his innards up in my food

424
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,848
so I wouldn't know I was eating him.

425
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,684
That's very cruel.

426
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,437
You don't strike me as cruel.

427
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:37,734
I don't think I am.

428
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,778
That's a relief.

429
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,030
Because you know
what happens when we marry?

430
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,491
We say our vows in
front of the high septon.

431
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,702
And after the ceremony, there's a feast.

432
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,704
When we marry, I become yours.

433
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,080
Forever.

434
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,835
It's getting late.

435
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,545
(Sighs)

436
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,130
I should go.

437
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,716
May I come and visit you again?

438
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:03,802
(Margaery chuckles)

439
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,263
All right, then.

440
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,352
Remember,

441
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,565
our little secret.

442
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,889
(Door closes)

443
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,770
Brienne: "Ser Jaime Lannister.

444
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:59,232
"Knighted and named to the kingsguard
in his 16th year.

445
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:03,445
"At the sack of king's landing,
murdered his king, aerys ii.

446
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,115
"Pardoned by Robert Baratheon.

447
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,035
"Thereafter known as the kingslayer."

448
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:13,497
It's the duty of the lord commander
to fill those pages.

449
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,294
And there's still room left on mine.

450
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:50,659
Valyrian steel.

451
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,827
Mmm.

452
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:55,831
It's yours.

453
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,833
I can't accept this.

454
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,559
It was reforged from ned stark's sword.

455
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,671
You'll use it to defend
ned stark's daughter.

456
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:05,799
You swore an oath

457
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,136
to return the stark girls to their mother.

458
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:11,096
Lady stark's dead.

459
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,514
Arya's probably dead, too,

460
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,851
but there's still a chance to
find sansa and get her somewhere safe.

461
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,854
I've got something else for you.

462
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,125
I hope I got your measurements right.

463
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,296
I'll find her.

464
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,383
For lady catelyn.

465
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:53,805
And for you.

466
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,064
I almost forgot.

467
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,401
I have one more gift.

468
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,324
Brienne: I don't need a squire.

469
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,825
Of course you do.

470
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,202
He'll slow me down.

471
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,536
My brother owes him a debt.

472
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,415
He's not safe here. You'll be
keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.

473
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,251
I won't slow you down, ser.

474
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:26,922
My lady.

475
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,299
I promise I'll serve you well.

476
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,594
See? He's a good lad. You'll get along.

477
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:40,185
Compliments of lord Tyrion.

478
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,103
His axe from the Blackwater.

479
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,319
What are you waiting for, a kiss?

480
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,615
Ready the lady's horse.

481
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:06,419
They say the best swords have names.
Any ideas?

482
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,302
Oath keeper.

483
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,649
Goodbye, brienne.

484
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,675
Podrick: Come on, move.

485
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,702
I should never have taken her away.

486
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,454
Jon: She wasn't safe here.

487
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,247
She's not safe out there.

488
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,540
I should have known.

489
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,602
You told us
there were wildlings south of the wall.

490
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,462
If they're raiding the smaller villages,
mole's town could be next.

491
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,213
Castle black could be next.

492
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,715
I should go back for gilly.

493
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,359
We have orders. No
one's to leave the castle.

494
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,969
I remember when you disobeyed orders
and rode south to help robb.

495
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,180
And I remember
who came after me and brought me home.

496
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,227
I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me.

497
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,649
When you told me about
bran going beyond the wall,

498
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,543
all I could think about was
getting my strength back

499
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,902
so I could go and find him.

500
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,781
I wish I could have convinced him
to come back with me.

501
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,077
I tried. Really, I did.

502
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,706
How fast could they travel?

503
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,460
A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge
by a simpleton?

504
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,003
I don't know.

505
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,839
They'd pass wildling villages.

506
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,801
They could try and find
shelter at one of them.

507
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,596
The wildlings have joined up with mance.

508
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,933
Every village or sheltered place
will be deserted.

509
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,271
Except...

510
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,944
Sam: Craster's?

511
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,112
- You think bran might have found...
- Locke: Snow.

512
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,867
I don't mean to interrupt.

513
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,537
Thorne wants to see you.

514
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,834
Your foray to craster's keep,

515
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,294
I'll sanction it.

516
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:57,215
But I won't order anyone to go with you.

517
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,801
Volunteers only.

518
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,262
Thank you, ser alliser.

519
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,767
(Indistinct conversations)

520
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,899
(Clears throat) Brothers.

521
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,152
(Conversations contin u e)

522
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,788
I'm going beyond the wall to craster's keep

523
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:31,958
to capture the mutineers holed up there

524
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,752
or kill them.

525
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,921
I'm asking for volunteers to come with me.

526
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:40,800
There's 60 miles of wilderness
between here and craster's,

527
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:44,179
and mance rayder has an army
bearing down on us,

528
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,597
but we have to do this.

529
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,975
Our survival may depend on us getting to

530
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,561
these mutineers before mance does.

531
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:55,774
They know the wall. They know our defences.

532
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,818
If mance learns what they know, we're lost.

533
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,448
But if that's not enough,

534
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,824
then consider this.

535
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,536
If the night's watch are truly brothers,

536
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,914
then lord commander mormont
was our father.

537
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,751
He lived and died for the watch

538
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,961
and he was betrayed by his own men.

539
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,671
Stabbed in the back by cowards.

540
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,632
He deserved far better.

541
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:24,344
All we can give him now is justice.

542
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,347
Who will join me?

543
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,239
(Exhales sharply)

544
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,691
I can't let a recruit
come north of the wall.

545
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,235
Then let me say my vows.

546
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,237
If it's a fight you're heading for,

547
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,281
then you need men who know how.

548
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,586
Thank you, brothers.

549
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,010
(Women whimpering)

550
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,804
Woman: No, don't.

551
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,973
Don't, please.

552
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,391
Woman 2: Please don't.

553
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,311
Ow! You're hurting me.

554
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:06,571
Karl Tanner from gin alley

555
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:13,077
drinking wine from the skull
of jeor fucking mormont.

556
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:23,046
Any command for us, lord commander?

557
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:25,173
What's that?

558
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,009
Fuck 'em till they're dead?

559
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:29,469
(Groans)

560
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,721
Did you hear that, boys?

561
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,348
Fuck 'em till they're dead.

562
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,106
Rast.

563
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,989
Go outside and feed the beast.

564
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,200
We should kill that thing.

565
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,913
You should shut your fucking hole,

566
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,165
ugly little cunt.

567
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:03,294
You look like a fucking ballsack. Ugly.

568
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,880
Look at your stupid cunt face.

569
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,759
I could piss in any gutter
and soak five of you.

570
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,639
Know how much they paid me to
kill a man in king's landing?

571
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,225
Seven silvers.

572
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:21,145
They told me a man's name
and that man never saw daylight again.

573
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:24,107
None of them cocksuckers got away from me.

574
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,655
Haven't lost a fight since I was nine.

575
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,158
Maybe it's time.

576
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,161
What do you think? Eh?

577
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,039
Maybe you're the man.

578
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,292
Eh, cunt?

579
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,256
I wouldn't stand a chance.

580
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,258
None of us would.

581
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,261
I was a fucking legend in gin alley.

582
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,681
A fucking legend!

583
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:00,476
I would take any knight, any time.

584
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:04,355
You fucking cunts in steel plate.
Fucking cowards.

585
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,362
(Baby cooing)

586
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:16,451
Women: A gift for the gods.

587
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,119
A gift for the gods.

588
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,620
What the fuck is that?

589
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,874
Craster's last child. A boy.

590
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,542
What am I supposed to do with him?

591
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,462
What did craster do?

592
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:30,423
Kill 'em before they could grow up
and do the same to him?

593
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,468
All right.

594
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,806
Don't need another mouth to feed.

595
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,641
Hand him over.

596
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,435
He didn't kill them.

597
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,561
He offered them.

598
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:44,687
To who?

599
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:45,813
To the gods.

600
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,067
The white walkers.

601
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,402
Women: (Chanting) A gift for the gods.

602
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,030
A gift for the gods.

603
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,574
A gift for the gods.

604
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:58,326
Shut up!

605
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,214
If it worked for him...

606
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,091
(Crying)

607
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:16,010
Let's give the walkers what they want.

608
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,600
(Baby continues crying)

609
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,686
Rast is headed that way.

610
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,333
(Baby fussing)

611
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:22,535
(Crying)

612
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,886
(Light growls)

613
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,852
(Growling)

614
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:54,775
Pink-eyed fuck.

615
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,072
You thirsty?

616
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,752
(Growls)

617
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:20,927
(Growls)

618
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,220
Fuck! (Groans)

619
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,141
(Crows cawing)

620
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:30,895
(Wind howling)

621
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,906
(Ice crackling)

622
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,120
(Barks)

623
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,210
(Baby crying in distance)

624
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,380
Hodor

625
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:04,845
Do you hear that?

626
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,187
Is that a baby?

627
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,731
It's coming.

628
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:17,400
I'm going out there.

629
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,652
No, we need to stay together.

630
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,529
I'm going.

631
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,757
(Baby crying)

632
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,890
(Ghost howling)

633
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:02,528
(Summer growls)

634
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,905
- (Gasps)
- Meera: Bran.

635
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,657
Hodor: Hodor.

636
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,510
- Bran, what happened?
- It's summer. He's hurt.

637
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,910
They've caught him in a trap.

638
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,454
Who?

639
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,914
I didn't see, but they
have my brother's wolf.

640
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,835
They have ghost.

641
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:24,842
Bran: They're night's watch.

642
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:26,761
Look.

643
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,388
Jon might be here.

644
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:32,850
If Jon was here,
why would they put his wolf in a cage?

645
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,227
(Woman whimpering)

646
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:37,605
- (Gasps)
- (Men shouting)

647
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,026
They might have been night's watch once,
not any more.

648
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,509
We're not safe here. We need to go.

649
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:44,945
Bran: No.

650
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,281
Bran, we need to go now.

651
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,949
I'm not leaving without summer.

652
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,730
Can you remember where the cage was?

653
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:00,044
The east side of the keep.

654
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,696
If I'm not back soon, we'll meet...

655
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,049
(Groans)

656
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,343
Hodor

657
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,229
(All shouting indistinctly)

658
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,191
Hodor

659
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,821
hodor

660
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,031
(groans)

661
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,451
Hodor

662
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:37,081
if I was your size,
I'd be king of the fucking world.

663
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,582
(Men laughing)

664
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,469
Help him up.

665
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,524
(Breathing heavily)

666
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,202
This is nice.

667
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:18,581
Fine leather.

668
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:22,168
You're no wildling.

669
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,962
Important. Highborn.

670
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,049
Who are you?

671
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:38,350
(Grunts)

672
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:40,227
You see, where I come from,

673
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:43,314
a commoner like me
slaps a little lord like you,

674
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,816
I'd lose me right hand.

675
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,487
But we're a long way from home, aren't we?

676
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,740
And then the two of you,

677
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:58,579
fancy-looking folks north of the wall
creeping through the woods.

678
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,249
Isn't that a bit odd?

679
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,671
I like your curly hair.

680
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:12,301
My mom had curls like that.

681
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:16,138
Beautiful brown curls.

682
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:20,351
Why'd you drag a crippled boy
all the way up here?

683
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:28,817
See, you haven't played this game before.

684
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,737
A highborn hostage,

685
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,615
that's valuable.

686
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,034
But three of them,

687
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,788
that's a lot of mouths to feed.

688
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,498
Rast: What the fuck's wrong with him?

689
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,958
Come here.

690
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,501
(Screams) No, please.

691
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,002
Please, let me help him.

692
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,212
Karl: Who are you?

693
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:49,505
Please.

694
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:50,673
Who are you?

695
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:55,052
I'm Brandon stark of winterfell.

696
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,762
(Jojen gagging)

697
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,639
It's Jon snow's brother.

698
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,103
It's meera. I'm right here.

699
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:08,774
And I thought
this was gonna be another boring day.

700
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,489
Meera: I'm right here.

701
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,950
(Wind howling)

702
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,986
(Ice crackling)

703
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,119
(Baby cooing)

704
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,087
(Baby crying)

705
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,291
(Cooing)

706
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,385
(Crackung)
