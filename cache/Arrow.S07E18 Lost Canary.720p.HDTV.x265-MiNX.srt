1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:01,250
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,175
We did it. The bombs are deactivated.

3
00:00:03,218 --> 00:00:04,674
The attack by the vigilantes has

4
00:00:04,698 --> 00:00:06,743
provided us an opportunity.

5
00:00:06,787 --> 00:00:08,785
- What is that?
- The tool that will allow us

6
00:00:08,786 --> 00:00:11,270
to eliminate all vigilantes for good.

7
00:00:11,313 --> 00:00:14,055
Gustavo Hernandez was found dead.

8
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,317
You think I did this.

9
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:16,928
I'm not exactly hearing a denial.

10
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:18,581
I have busted my ass,

11
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:21,952
but no matter what I do, you always
just see me as the Black Siren.

12
00:00:21,976 --> 00:00:23,606
District Attorney Laurel Lance.

13
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,937
New photos show her with Ricardo Diaz.

14
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,200
Could the city's highest prosecutor

15
00:00:28,243 --> 00:00:30,332
actually be a wanted criminal herself?

16
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:33,814
Looks like you've got a problem.

17
00:00:45,347 --> 00:00:46,696
You lost?

18
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,263
I'm here to see Shadow Thief.

19
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,179
She's busy,

20
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:54,008
but you can stay here with us.

21
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:55,662
- Hyah!
- Unh!

22
00:00:57,011 --> 00:00:58,665
I'll pass.

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,640
Where the hell is Shadow Thief?

24
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:20,643
Uh! Who are you?

25
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,998
I'm Black Siren.

26
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:33,559

27
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:44,319
Still kicking ass, I see.

28
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:46,669
I heard you were back in town.

29
00:01:46,713 --> 00:01:49,777
And I heard you traded in
your leather for a power suit.

30
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:51,873
Well, that suit didn't really fit.

31
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,919
Seems the entire city
has turned against you.

32
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:58,923
Just reminded me that there's
only one person I can trust...

33
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:00,490
myself.

34
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:02,492
It's too bad about Diaz.

35
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:04,059
What, that he didn't die sooner?

36
00:02:04,102 --> 00:02:05,974
I couldn't agree more,

37
00:02:06,017 --> 00:02:10,413
but at least he introduced
us before he did.

38
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:12,763
As much as I'm enjoying
this little reunion,

39
00:02:12,806 --> 00:02:14,634
why don't you tell me why you're here?

40
00:02:14,678 --> 00:02:16,245
I'm looking for a partner.

41
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:17,681
You got a job?

42
00:02:17,724 --> 00:02:19,030
Multiple...

43
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:25,515
And I need someone with your
particular set of skills.

44
00:02:29,823 --> 00:02:32,957
Ugh.

45
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:34,959
Who was that?

46
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:37,266
No one.

47
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:38,963
You still good with locks?

48
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:45,535
Hey, Laurel. It's me again.

49
00:02:45,578 --> 00:02:48,103
I just had a craving for French fries,

50
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:50,409
milk shakes, and really cold fruit.

51
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:52,455
Are you in?

52
00:02:52,498 --> 00:02:54,085
Look. I know this is
probably gonna get buried

53
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:56,520
between the many, many,
many, many messages

54
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:58,230
I have already left you, but
I'm just trying to make sure

55
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:02,813
you are OK, so if you
could call me back, please.

56
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:06,991
Still trying to get
in touch with Laurel?

57
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:09,298
Yeah. It's taking an alarming
"swingers" amount of time.

58
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:11,169
Not proud, and my go-to way to find her

59
00:03:11,213 --> 00:03:12,649
would be Archer, but that is taking

60
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,496
an annoyingly long time
to get back online, so...

61
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,827
She doesn't want to be found, Felicity.

62
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,351
Her whole life has been
flipped upside down.

63
00:03:19,395 --> 00:03:22,006
I know what that's like. Just...

64
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,575
Speaking of, are you
sure that you are OK

65
00:03:25,618 --> 00:03:27,316
now that you know
that your sister's evil

66
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:30,101
and tried to kill you?

67
00:03:30,145 --> 00:03:31,668
Too soon?

68
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,670
Need to focus on finding her

69
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,673
and the Ninth Circle and stopping
whatever they have planned.

70
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,328
Well, lucky for you, your
wife is incredibly resourceful.

71
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:41,025
So I made a cheat
sheet on your new lead.

72
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:42,916
Emiko's bullet led me to
Andrew Thornton's rifle,

73
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,768
which led me to 12
different shell companies,

74
00:03:44,811 --> 00:03:46,552
which led me to the buyer.

75
00:03:46,596 --> 00:03:48,704
And it's not weird that she
hasn't found the buyer herself

76
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,992
with the resources of the
Ninth Circle at her disposal?

77
00:03:51,035 --> 00:03:53,211
OK. Well, not to toot my own horn,

78
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:56,301
but Emiko is more of the "Karate
Kid", Hilary Swank version,

79
00:03:56,345 --> 00:04:01,828
and I am more of the "Mr.
Robot" version but prettier.

80
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:04,500
Have you considered that
Emiko probably made up

81
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:06,244
the whole "finding my
mother's killer" thing?

82
00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:10,185
I know that she's lied about
basically everything else,

83
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:11,751
but I... I just have a sixth sense

84
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:14,885
that she's not lying about this one,

85
00:04:14,928 --> 00:04:16,843
so if John and I can
find the killer first,

86
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:20,412
then we can leverage that
against Emiko and the Ninth Circle

87
00:04:20,456 --> 00:04:21,737
and stop whatever they have planned.

88
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,087
Well, I have a sense that a road trip

89
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:26,244
with John is exactly
what the doctor ordered.

90
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:27,680
Bring Rene with you for backup.

91
00:04:27,724 --> 00:04:32,381
Rene... ahem... has a
school thing with Zoe.

92
00:04:32,424 --> 00:04:33,904
Speaking of which, will you just...

93
00:04:33,947 --> 00:04:35,514
will you take it easy for me, please?

94
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:37,299
Oh, who? Me? Um, you know what?

95
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:38,662
I really wish I could, but I have

96
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:40,737
a really intense Netflix binge

97
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,347
that I have scheduled way back,

98
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:44,412
and I also am going to eat
everything in the fridge,

99
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:46,569
so it's gonna get pretty crazy in here.

100
00:04:46,612 --> 00:04:48,701
- Precious cargo.
- I know.

101
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:53,228
Disarmed.

102
00:04:57,275 --> 00:04:59,016
Is he still following us?

103
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,539
I don't see him.

104
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,411
I think we finally lost the son of a...

105
00:05:02,454 --> 00:05:04,239
Oh! Uh!

106
00:05:09,722 --> 00:05:11,637
Spoke too soon.

107
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:13,204
Over here. Hurry.

108
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,172
Zoe, Mia, come in.

109
00:05:24,215 --> 00:05:25,608
What's your ETA?

110
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:27,610
Trying to shake a bogey.

111
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:29,307
What's the status on Nest Two?

112
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:32,136
Gone. Galaxy One has
raided all of our safe houses.

113
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,007
Alpha base is our last secure location.

114
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:37,315
All surviving Canaries need
to rendezvous here immediately.

115
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,838
Be careful.

116
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:41,928
We need to take this guy out.

117
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:43,452
Dinah gave us an order.

118
00:05:43,495 --> 00:05:45,541
I don't work for Dinah.

119
00:05:54,898 --> 00:05:57,292
We're clear. Let's go.

120
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,083
What the hell are you doing?

121
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:07,780
Finishing this.

122
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:14,483
You'll get us both killed.

123
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,537
Former District Attorney Laurel Lance

124
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:27,713
is facing allegations of murder

125
00:06:27,757 --> 00:06:31,891
following the death of Halcone gang
member Gustavo Hernandez last week.

126
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,894
The SCPD has issued a
warrant for her arrest,

127
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:36,940
sparking a city-wide manhunt.

128
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:39,203
Anyone with information
on her whereabouts...

129
00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:41,181
A manhunt? Don't you think
that's a little harsh?

130
00:06:41,205 --> 00:06:43,164
- Laurel killed someone.
- Allegedly.

131
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:46,210
Her DNA and fingerprints
were found all over the scene.

132
00:06:46,254 --> 00:06:47,820
Laurel is smart. You really think that

133
00:06:47,864 --> 00:06:50,475
she'd leave evidence behind
if she really did kill the guy?

134
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,531
She had a pretty strong motive.

135
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:53,560
Hernandez's death was imperative
in her winning her case.

136
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:55,200
She hasn't killed anyone
since she's been the D.A.

137
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:56,401
Why would she start now?

138
00:06:56,854 --> 00:06:58,464
You've seen how hard she's worked,

139
00:06:58,508 --> 00:07:00,249
how much she's changed.

140
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:01,859
Except she obviously hasn't.

141
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:03,295
Look. I know she's your friend,

142
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,818
and for a while, I actually thought

143
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:06,361
the two of us were doing
good work together, too,

144
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,648
but the truth is Laurel is Black Siren.

145
00:07:08,692 --> 00:07:11,042
She is a ruthless murderer,
and we are all fooling

146
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:13,526
ourselves thinking she is anything
like the real Laurel Lance.

147
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,134
We should be helping
her, not hunting her.

148
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:17,614
Laurel is a criminal,

149
00:07:17,657 --> 00:07:19,746
and we are going to
bring her to justice,

150
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,097
something we should have
done a long time ago.

151
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:47,513
Pinky Santorini.

152
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:49,515
It's quite the operation
you've got here.

153
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:50,821
What are you talking about?

154
00:07:50,864 --> 00:07:53,041
I own a dry-cleaning business.

155
00:07:53,084 --> 00:07:55,826
Please. I haven't had
a problem in 22 years.

156
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:57,959
Well, it looks like
you have a problem now.

157
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,095
Thanks for playing.

158
00:08:13,322 --> 00:08:15,715
Time for our payday.

159
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,552
Feels good to be back.

160
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:35,925
Hey. Are you OK? Your message made it

161
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,999
sound like the bunker was on fire.

162
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:39,739
Laurel didn't kill Gustavo Hernandez.

163
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:41,454
- Emiko did.
- What are you talking about?

164
00:08:41,498 --> 00:08:43,906
This is his toxicology report.
There were traces of hydrogen cyanide

165
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:47,415
found in his blood, which is the
go-to poison of the Ninth Circle.

166
00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:49,161
The SCPD had no reason
to trace it back to them.

167
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:53,624
Emiko framed Laurel because Laurel
told Oliver her secret. Boom.

168
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,210
Well, it still doesn't change anything.

169
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,995
Of course it does. Did
you hear what I just said?

170
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:58,474
Even if Laurel didn't kill Hernandez,

171
00:08:58,498 --> 00:09:00,424
she's back to being Black Siren.

172
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:02,225
There was just a robbery
at Pinky's Dry cleaner.

173
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:05,718
- What'd they steal, bubbles?
- Pinky's is run by Walter Santorini.

174
00:09:05,738 --> 00:09:07,150
He's a money launderer for the mob.

175
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:08,797
- They took over 100 grand.
- Whoa.

176
00:09:08,825 --> 00:09:10,038
- Yeah.
- Maybe she needs the money

177
00:09:10,043 --> 00:09:11,334
because she's planning
on leaving town again.

178
00:09:11,358 --> 00:09:14,014
- She also now has a partner.
- Well, there has to be an explanation.

179
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:15,389
Santorini's actually part of a case

180
00:09:15,394 --> 00:09:17,537
Laurel and I had been working
for the last few months,

181
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,315
a case which is now nonexistent

182
00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:20,758
thanks to this last little stunt.

183
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:23,405
So she's using her D.A.
resources to identify targets.

184
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:24,688
That's clever.

185
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,490
Bad. Very bad.

186
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:30,718
OK. This is the
database of all the cases

187
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:33,000
currently being investigated by
the district attorney's office.

188
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,511
Please hold. Yeah. Looks like
Laurel's been accessing it

189
00:09:35,535 --> 00:09:37,149
through a series of
rerouted IP addresses.

190
00:09:37,173 --> 00:09:38,529
- Does that mean we can track her?
- I mean,

191
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:40,003
it means I could probably talk to her,

192
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:41,772
and then I can convince her

193
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:44,392
not to do this whole
Black Siren backslide

194
00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:46,488
- or whatever this is.
- Well, even if you could,

195
00:09:46,798 --> 00:09:48,853
damage is already done.

196
00:09:52,945 --> 00:09:55,557
It was a good chat. I
really love our chats.

197
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,133
Felicity tell you how she tracked
the rifle to this apartment?

198
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:10,404
Just call her a genius
and leave it at that.

199
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:13,450
- Gonna check upstairs.
- Copy that.

200
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,879
- Oliver, I found some...
- Nothing!

201
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:43,947
You.

202
00:10:44,072 --> 00:10:45,562
New outfit.

203
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:53,339
You think an arrow is gonna stop me?

204
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,214
I think a tranq arrow will.

205
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:06,458
- Do you know him?
- He's one of the Longbow Hunters.

206
00:11:06,503 --> 00:11:09,038
What are they doing mixed up
in Emiko's mother's murder?

207
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:11,022
That's a good question.

208
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,990
Don't hang up, and I mean that.

209
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,241
Literally, you will not
be able to exit my window.

210
00:11:30,302 --> 00:11:32,371
You really can't take a hint, can you?

211
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,911
Look. I know that Emiko
killed Gustavo Hernandez.

212
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:37,911
Ooh! Congratulations,
Detective Felicity.

213
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,722
It's only a matter of time
until Oliver stops her,

214
00:11:39,737 --> 00:11:41,646
so whatever bad and evil
plan that you have brewing,

215
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,918
it's not too late for you to
not go over to the dark side.

216
00:11:43,942 --> 00:11:45,718
Oliver's sister did me a favor

217
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:47,605
because I was really sick and tired

218
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,274
of pretending to be somebody I'm not.

219
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,925
- Plus, no one believed it anyway.
- I did.

220
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:53,848
Look. What happened to you wasn't fair.

221
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:55,781
You were accused of
murder, you lost your job,

222
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,254
Dinah didn't have your back.

223
00:11:57,286 --> 00:11:59,814
I get it. You got a
bucket load of bad news,

224
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:02,813
but you are not Black
Siren, not anymore.

225
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:04,894
It's funny. I used to believe that, too.

226
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:06,685
Think of all the good
you've done, Laurel.

227
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,301
- Think about honoring Quentin.
- Quentin is dead.

228
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:10,821
Nobody cares about Quentin.

229
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:14,172
- He only wanted his daughter back.
- That is not true.

230
00:12:14,297 --> 00:12:16,174
You've done a lot of good as the D.A.,

231
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:19,115
not to mention you were there
for me when I needed a friend.

232
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,731
I'm not willing to let you
just throw that all away

233
00:12:21,736 --> 00:12:22,971
and forget about it.

234
00:12:23,096 --> 00:12:25,374
Look. I'm really sorry if you thought

235
00:12:25,394 --> 00:12:26,881
we had a real friendship,

236
00:12:26,924 --> 00:12:28,801
but it was all just an act,

237
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:32,330
and don't you dare try and stop me.

238
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,021
Stopping those bombs prompted Galaxy One

239
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,635
to put their master plan in motion,

240
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,219
expanding Archer's
influence into Star City

241
00:12:42,225 --> 00:12:44,724
and making sure they take
out any and all opposition.

242
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:46,768
Starting with the Canaries.

243
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,889
How many have we lost?

244
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:52,123
I'm waiting on a body count

245
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,256
from Roy, William, and Connor,

246
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:57,609
but they've already confirmed
10 dead and 5 missing.

247
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:01,348
It's not your fault.

248
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:03,730
But it's my responsibility.

249
00:13:07,762 --> 00:13:10,975
Oh, thank goodness you two are safe.

250
00:13:13,287 --> 00:13:14,905
Yeah. Um,

251
00:13:15,644 --> 00:13:18,093
could have taken creepy
mask guy off the board

252
00:13:18,105 --> 00:13:20,369
except someone got in my way.

253
00:13:20,412 --> 00:13:22,240
Zoe made the right call.

254
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:24,079
We've lost enough
blood already as it is.

255
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:26,067
And until we know what
the hell is going on,

256
00:13:26,077 --> 00:13:29,025
- we need to lay low.
- And do what, nothing?

257
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,384
What we do is mourn our dead.

258
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:35,122
Then we figure out a plan that
won't cost us any more lives.

259
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,064
You're right.

260
00:13:37,456 --> 00:13:40,144
Galaxy One has us
out-manned and outgunned.

261
00:13:40,182 --> 00:13:41,916
We need to find another
way to even the odds.

262
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,862
Galaxy One just decimated
the entire Canary network.

263
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:47,202
You want to even the odds,

264
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:49,136
you get out there and
you fight the hell back.

265
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,666
If you don't, we're all dead.

266
00:14:04,694 --> 00:14:06,980
- Psst.
- Unh!

267
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:10,309
I really missed our girls' nights out.

268
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:12,970
- Me, too.
- Like taking candy.

269
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,166
From a filthy rich baby.

270
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:30,924
That's got to be $10
million worth of diamonds.

271
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,165
It's too bad it doesn't belong to you.

272
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,235
And what?

273
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,274
Are you gonna stop us?

274
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:40,213
Don't do this, Laurel.

275
00:14:40,284 --> 00:14:42,520
Oh, I thought you'd be happy.

276
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:44,844
You were right about me all along.

277
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:49,291
Oh, and it's too bad that you
don't have your cry anymore.

278
00:14:56,192 --> 00:14:58,357
But I still have mine.

279
00:14:58,367 --> 00:14:59,870
Phew. What an entrance.

280
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:01,432
Oh, and feel free to
tell Laurel's new friend

281
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:03,380
that it's a bad idea to
leave vault schematics

282
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:05,082
just hanging around her lair.

283
00:15:07,054 --> 00:15:08,435
What are you doing here?

284
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:10,069
Yeah. Same question.

285
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:12,377
Aren't you supposed to be on your
little spaceship or something?

286
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:14,592
I took a break to clean up your mess.

287
00:15:14,617 --> 00:15:16,596
What is this, some kind of intervention.

288
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:18,462
I know you're not my sister,

289
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,906
but in another world or another life,

290
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,464
you could have been,

291
00:15:22,995 --> 00:15:24,851
and my father believed in you.

292
00:15:24,852 --> 00:15:26,507
Well, he was wrong,

293
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:29,658
but you're right about one thing.

294
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:32,304
You're not my sister.

295
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:11,815
Stay the hell away from me.

296
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:21,247
You didn't go back to the bunker.

297
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,944
- We always go back to the bunker.
- I had work to do.

298
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:27,074
I know I should have
told you about Sara.

299
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,471
It would have been nice.
And what was that device?

300
00:16:29,502 --> 00:16:31,444
I modified O.G. Laurel's old collar.

301
00:16:31,469 --> 00:16:34,232
- Same tech, new look.
- It was impressive.

302
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:37,384
Felicity, we are the only team
sanctioned to work with SCPD.

303
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:40,278
Please remember it doesn't mean
any vigilante gets a free pass.

304
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:42,610
In my defense, if anyone's
gonna get through to Laurel,

305
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,216
it's her sister... well,
not her real sister,

306
00:16:45,256 --> 00:16:46,547
but the face of her sister...
you know what I mean.

307
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:48,023
You cannot seriously think

308
00:16:48,054 --> 00:16:50,215
she's still capable of
redemption after what we just saw.

309
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,753
That is harsh, especially
coming from the person

310
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,229
who wrongly accused her of murder.

311
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:55,246
So you're saying what
Laurel's doing is my fault?

312
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:57,985
Our fault. Maybe if we had been
a better support system to her.

313
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,610
Laurel did not become Black Siren

314
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:01,339
because we were bad friends, Felicity.

315
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:03,313
That is a choice she made on her own.

316
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:05,997
It is not some inevitable
consequence of something we did.

317
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:08,147
Everything that has happened
since she has been fired

318
00:17:08,172 --> 00:17:10,544
- is on her!
- I think you're being hard on her

319
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:11,604
because you feel guilty.

320
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:13,686
And I think you need
to drop the blinders.

321
00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:20,483
This is Laurel's new gal pal...

322
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:24,622
Aviva Metula, former Mossad
agent turned master thief.

323
00:17:24,642 --> 00:17:26,989
She now goes by the name Shadow Thief.

324
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,182
- Very on the nose.
- She used to work with Diaz,

325
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:31,166
which means she probably
used to work with Laurel.

326
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:33,131
It looks like Shadow
Thief has really leveled up

327
00:17:33,156 --> 00:17:34,958
her bad guy game since her Diaz days.

328
00:17:34,978 --> 00:17:36,279
There's no more petty heists.

329
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:38,550
It's only a matter of
time before she gets Laurel

330
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:40,503
mixed up in whatever
she came to town for.

331
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:43,306
- Then we better find them fast.
- OK.

332
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,505
Felicity must have figured out

333
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,301
I was using the D.A.
database to find our targets.

334
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:52,043
Which one was Felicity?

335
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,394
The chatty one.

336
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:55,609
Here.

337
00:17:56,312 --> 00:17:57,835
You need this.

338
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:01,573
Don't worry. There are plenty of jobs.

339
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:03,936
Not if she knows how I'm finding them.

340
00:18:03,951 --> 00:18:05,428
Maybe it's a good thing.

341
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:08,401
No offense, but your
jobs are small potatoes.

342
00:18:08,444 --> 00:18:11,431
- What do you mean?
- Let's just say that since our Diaz days

343
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:13,344
I've met some new friends,

344
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,666
some very powerful friends

345
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:18,839
who pay very well for
my destructive services.

346
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:21,180
- So you're a terrorist for hire?
- Heh heh.

347
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:24,955
I prefer mercenary with perks,

348
00:18:25,193 --> 00:18:27,211
and I could use someone like you.

349
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:28,795
I just want to make sure

350
00:18:28,871 --> 00:18:31,511
that you're the same ruthless
Black Siren I once knew.

351
00:18:31,554 --> 00:18:33,565
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

352
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:36,706
Good because if those women

353
00:18:36,752 --> 00:18:39,241
continue to be a problem for us...

354
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,173
You don't have to worry.

355
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:48,080
They get in our way again,
I'll kill them myself.

356
00:18:49,224 --> 00:18:51,722
Who hired you to kill Kazumi Adachi?

357
00:18:52,187 --> 00:18:53,867
Kazumi who?

358
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,278
Wrong answer.

359
00:18:57,099 --> 00:18:58,561
Doesn't matter to us.

360
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,261
How do you want this to go?

361
00:19:00,276 --> 00:19:02,861
You guys can chop off
all 10 of my fingers,

362
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:04,192
and it won't matter.

363
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:06,914
I have no idea who hired me.

364
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:09,250
They never contacted me directly.

365
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:10,749
Then how'd they offer you the job?

366
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:13,355
They directed me to
a drop-off location.

367
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:16,203
Once I got there, found a coin.

368
00:19:16,328 --> 00:19:17,847
Was it an Italian florin?

369
00:19:17,872 --> 00:19:21,163
No idea. All I know is that it was old.

370
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,480
There was a microchip inside,

371
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,516
instructions to get
my weapon, the target.

372
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:28,535
Once the job was completed,

373
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,904
they wired my payment from a
bank account in Switzerland.

374
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:36,037
A florin, Swiss bank account.

375
00:19:37,322 --> 00:19:38,789
John, this is Dante.

376
00:19:38,914 --> 00:19:42,225
So what now? You guys kill me?

377
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:45,701
Let's go. We got what we came for.

378
00:20:00,985 --> 00:20:02,483
Well,

379
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,196
I'm having déjà vu in
the best way possible.

380
00:20:06,854 --> 00:20:08,845
Did Dinah read you the Riot Act?

381
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:10,390
Nothing I can't handle.

382
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:12,459
You've come a long
way from the I.T. girl

383
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,195
secretly crushing on Oliver Queen.

384
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:15,445
Apparently, it wasn't much of a secret.

385
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,443
Everybody knew. Zero poker face,

386
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,516
and I always wondered, you
know, were you flirting with me

387
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:21,550
- all those times you said I was cute?
- Why?

388
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:24,379
- Were you into it?
- Of course. It's you.

389
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:27,991
- Oh, I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

390
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:30,050
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

391
00:20:30,101 --> 00:20:32,034
I just wish it had gone better.

392
00:20:32,054 --> 00:20:33,283
Look. Laurel will come around.

393
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,735
All we have to do is get her away

394
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:37,068
from her new BFF long enough
to knock some sense into her.

395
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:38,991
I mean, that is if you
don't have to go back

396
00:20:39,011 --> 00:20:40,680
for any timey-wimey shenanigans.

397
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,259
Well, every time I leave the ship,

398
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:44,662
it basically means the
inmates take over the asylum,

399
00:20:44,687 --> 00:20:46,109
but it's fine.

400
00:20:46,317 --> 00:20:48,624
Want to make sure that
my real sister's name

401
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,127
doesn't get dragged through the mud,

402
00:20:50,171 --> 00:20:52,033
and, by the way, why
are you so concerned

403
00:20:52,064 --> 00:20:53,146
with saving this Laurel?

404
00:20:53,156 --> 00:20:55,549
I mean, she's more like
our Laurel than you realize.

405
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:58,793
She helped Oliver get out
of prison the legal way,

406
00:20:58,813 --> 00:21:02,729
and she stopped me from
killing Ricardo Diaz.

407
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:05,435
Felicity Smoak is killing people now?

408
00:21:05,461 --> 00:21:06,690
I really have missed a lot.

409
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,921
The point is, is that
I didn't kill anyone

410
00:21:08,946 --> 00:21:10,861
because Laurel pulled
me back from the edge.

411
00:21:11,018 --> 00:21:12,429
That's what I want to do for her now,

412
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:14,022
you know, send her out a lifeline.

413
00:21:14,978 --> 00:21:18,591
Even if there was a way back
for Laurel, she has to want it.

414
00:21:18,616 --> 00:21:20,382
You can't force redemption on people.

415
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:22,296
Oh, that I know.

416
00:21:23,204 --> 00:21:25,138
Well, it's all theoretical
anyway since I have no idea

417
00:21:25,162 --> 00:21:27,351
where Shadow Thief or
Laurel are operating out of.

418
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:30,336
Hold that thought.
Dinah just got a location

419
00:21:30,361 --> 00:21:32,242
on Shadow Thief's secret hideout.

420
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:34,968
Turns out... of course, of course...

421
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,203
it's at a shady warehouse
in a shady part of town.

422
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:41,570
Is that where Laurel's been holing up?

423
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:43,742
- That's what Dinah thinks.
- _

424
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:45,464
Man, it is completely off the grid.

425
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,789
Dinah wants me to go with her
so she doesn't go in blind.

426
00:21:48,991 --> 00:21:50,688
So we don't go in blind.

427
00:21:50,713 --> 00:21:55,516
Um, no. Mmm. This is
more of a two-woman job.

428
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,046
Dinah wants to keep it above board.

429
00:21:57,071 --> 00:21:59,586
No. Got it. Not invited.

430
00:22:00,847 --> 00:22:02,484
- OK.
- OK.

431
00:22:03,897 --> 00:22:04,890
Call me.

432
00:22:06,682 --> 00:22:08,138
Not to belabor the point or anything,

433
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:09,705
but it would have been
really nice to have

434
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,445
White Canary here with us...
the flight. Heh!

435
00:22:11,469 --> 00:22:13,602
You know, since you're both
Canaries and everything.

436
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:15,125
- Can we talk about this later?
- Mm-hmm.

437
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,312
Who's here besides us?

438
00:22:16,337 --> 00:22:18,234
There's only two heat
signatures in the entire building

439
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:19,869
besides us, and...

440
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,788
they're right behind this door.

441
00:22:25,948 --> 00:22:27,994
It's got to be Shadow Thief and Laurel.

442
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:32,172
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

443
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:42,726
Where are they?

444
00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:45,939
- They played us.
- Fake heat signatures?

445
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:48,179
That is devious and impressive.

446
00:22:51,685 --> 00:22:53,077
Get down!

447
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,926
Are you OK?

448
00:22:59,297 --> 00:23:00,603
Laurel tried to kill us.

449
00:23:04,531 --> 00:23:06,141
It turns out we could have used some

450
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,428
White Canary backup after all.

451
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,629
- Well, you got it now.
- Sorry.

452
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,046
No worries.

453
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:12,195
Find anything at the lair?

454
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,656
No, not yet.

455
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:15,357
They were sloppy, though.

456
00:23:15,382 --> 00:23:16,707
Probably too fixated on killing us.

457
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:18,516
The tech that Shadow Thief left behind

458
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,255
will probably give us some
insight on how she operates.

459
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,456
With any luck, that's
how we'll find her.

460
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,617
I'm so sorry.

461
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,859
I really thought Laurel had changed.

462
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,531
Well, that's all right. We're just lucky

463
00:23:31,556 --> 00:23:33,167
she's rusty and messed up.

464
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:36,133
- Yeah.
- Or maybe it's not luck at all.

465
00:23:36,302 --> 00:23:39,392
I mean, Black Siren's a
lethal, unforgiving killer.

466
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,638
It's rare she fails, even rarer
she doesn't do the job herself.

467
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:48,506
I'm gonna get some air. Let me
know if you guys find anything.

468
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:55,459
You know, maybe if I could
have helped more or...

469
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:58,941
Felicity, you have to
stop blaming yourself.

470
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,588
Laurel had every opportunity
to make the right decision,

471
00:24:01,631 --> 00:24:02,742
and she didn't.

472
00:24:03,048 --> 00:24:04,655
Laurel has not changed.

473
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,293
She is the same monster
who killed Vinnie.

474
00:24:08,464 --> 00:24:12,851
What Laurel did is unforgivable,

475
00:24:14,383 --> 00:24:16,234
but she's just on this path,

476
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:18,234
and she doesn't know
how to get off of it.

477
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:19,501
Do you know how many
times in my life

478
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:20,766
I could have gone
down the same path,

479
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:23,019
including killing Laurel
last year, and I didn't?

480
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,008
Yeah, you didn't because you had us.

481
00:24:25,453 --> 00:24:27,241
I mean, when Oliver
brought you on the team,

482
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,273
you weren't exactly a Saint.

483
00:24:28,298 --> 00:24:30,508
I was protecting women who
couldn't protect themselves.

484
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:33,508
Yes, but even in your darkest of times,

485
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:35,404
even when you were
hell-bent on killing Laurel,

486
00:24:35,448 --> 00:24:36,726
we still had your back.

487
00:24:36,751 --> 00:24:38,218
I mean, we gave you a second chance,

488
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,359
and look where you are now.

489
00:24:39,384 --> 00:24:41,047
You're... you're captain of the SCPD,

490
00:24:41,072 --> 00:24:42,414
you're a deputized vigilante.

491
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,492
I mean, you couldn't
possibly have imagined

492
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:46,625
that this is where you
would have ended up.

493
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,783
No, that's true, but I...

494
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:52,015
I'm grateful for Oliver
and for the whole team,

495
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,868
but I don't think it
matters with Laurel.

496
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:56,367
I don't think she ever even
wanted that kind of support.

497
00:24:56,392 --> 00:24:58,655
Or maybe she wanted
it more than any of us

498
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,769
and didn't realize it until it was gone.

499
00:25:11,571 --> 00:25:13,442
I appreciate you wanting payback

500
00:25:13,486 --> 00:25:14,875
for what happened to the Canaries,

501
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:16,828
but not like this.

502
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,622
Mia, if you go out there on your own,

503
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,846
chances are you will
not make it back alive.

504
00:25:22,538 --> 00:25:25,280
Galaxy One found all of
your safe houses, Dinah.

505
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,729
They'll find this one, too.

506
00:25:26,754 --> 00:25:28,738
I'm not gonna sit
around and wait for them

507
00:25:28,762 --> 00:25:30,401
to massacre the rest of us.

508
00:25:31,939 --> 00:25:34,245
Believe me, there is nothing
I would love more than to see

509
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:36,726
those sons of bitches pay
for what they did to my girls.

510
00:25:36,751 --> 00:25:39,784
- So why don't you?
- Because I know I can't do it alone,

511
00:25:41,296 --> 00:25:44,502
- and neither can you.
- Then come with me.

512
00:25:44,952 --> 00:25:46,475
Instead of hiding in the shadows,

513
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,370
let's take this fight to Galaxy One,

514
00:25:48,395 --> 00:25:51,057
make them pay for blood with blood.

515
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,744
Sometimes, I don't know
who you sound more like...

516
00:25:54,991 --> 00:25:57,036
your mother or your father.

517
00:26:00,306 --> 00:26:02,331
Do you know why I started the Canaries,

518
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,346
what it represents?

519
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:09,768
This is more than just
some rebellion group.

520
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,502
It's a support system.

521
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,157
This is a way for women to know
we always have each other's backs

522
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,565
no matter what happens,

523
00:26:17,965 --> 00:26:20,141
whenever we need it most,

524
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:23,362
something I failed to
do for a friend once,

525
00:26:24,644 --> 00:26:26,099
but ever since that happened with her,

526
00:26:26,123 --> 00:26:27,777
I made a promise to myself that I

527
00:26:27,821 --> 00:26:30,331
would never make that mistake again.

528
00:26:31,408 --> 00:26:33,018
That's why we wear these.

529
00:26:34,505 --> 00:26:36,550
To honor that promise

530
00:26:36,743 --> 00:26:40,112
and the bravery and the sacrifice

531
00:26:40,877 --> 00:26:43,534
shared with these amazing women,

532
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:49,409
who somehow... no matter how many
times they get knocked down...

533
00:26:50,658 --> 00:26:53,182
they always find the strength

534
00:26:53,207 --> 00:26:56,940
to get back up and fight again...

535
00:26:58,591 --> 00:27:02,638
And that is exactly what the
surviving Canaries are going to do

536
00:27:02,682 --> 00:27:05,940
together but when the time is right.

537
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,065
It's too bad I'm not a Canary.

538
00:27:25,574 --> 00:27:29,487
Dante has been pulling the
strings this entire time.

539
00:27:30,378 --> 00:27:32,745
He orchestrates her mother's murder,

540
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:36,560
and he sends her down this path.

541
00:27:36,585 --> 00:27:38,979
Sounds like you're softening
up on your sister again.

542
00:27:39,022 --> 00:27:41,815
I just have a better understanding
of why she's done what she's done.

543
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:45,246
When Emiko realizes that Dante
has been manipulating her,

544
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:49,058
it will drive a wedge between
her and the Ninth Circle.

545
00:27:51,814 --> 00:27:53,947
That's how we stop them.

546
00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:00,780
_

547
00:28:02,132 --> 00:28:04,062
Thought I might find you here.

548
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,288
It's pretty brave of you,

549
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,139
sneaking up on me from behind.

550
00:28:09,164 --> 00:28:11,122
If you wanted to kill people,

551
00:28:11,185 --> 00:28:13,404
you wouldn't have gave
them that warning time

552
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:14,718
before the bomb went off.

553
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:18,668
I really miss him.

554
00:28:18,693 --> 00:28:20,477
It looks like you do, too.

555
00:28:20,502 --> 00:28:23,461
Is this you trying to
convince me that I've changed,

556
00:28:23,486 --> 00:28:25,148
that I'm more like your Laurel?

557
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:29,786
No. Nobody's as good as
the original Laurel Lance,

558
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:30,960
not even me.

559
00:28:34,687 --> 00:28:37,765
Look. I don't know what
you've heard about me,

560
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:41,103
but basically, I had an affair

561
00:28:41,128 --> 00:28:43,130
with my sister's boyfriend,

562
00:28:43,173 --> 00:28:46,530
I allowed my entire family
to think that I was dead,

563
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:49,427
and then I became a
league-trained assassin.

564
00:28:49,452 --> 00:28:51,628
Wow. That's impressive.

565
00:28:51,653 --> 00:28:54,090
My point is even someone with a past

566
00:28:54,115 --> 00:28:56,851
as checkered as mine can
still turn their life around,

567
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,288
- can be a hero.
- I was being a hero.

568
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:03,106
I was the D.A., I got
Oliver out of prison,

569
00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:04,872
and I was the only one who figured out

570
00:29:04,897 --> 00:29:07,117
that his little sister
was basically the devil,

571
00:29:07,405 --> 00:29:08,938
and they still turned on me.

572
00:29:08,982 --> 00:29:11,694
So, what, you think you deserve a medal

573
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:14,664
for trying to be good for 5 seconds?

574
00:29:14,727 --> 00:29:17,648
Redemption isn't a
destination. It's a journey.

575
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:22,735
I wasted years running away

576
00:29:22,778 --> 00:29:24,475
from all the bad things that I had done

577
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,046
because I didn't want to face
the pain that I had caused

578
00:29:27,373 --> 00:29:29,609
because I didn't want to be that person,

579
00:29:30,743 --> 00:29:36,966
and then I realized the only
way to stop being that person

580
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,968
was to come home and own up

581
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:40,970
to the things that I had done,

582
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:43,546
and, yeah, it was painful,

583
00:29:43,663 --> 00:29:46,143
and it took a really long time,

584
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,905
but it was the only way
to become someone else,

585
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:51,984
someone better than who I was.

586
00:29:54,244 --> 00:29:55,859
Well, that's great for you,

587
00:29:57,266 --> 00:29:59,702
but even if I wanted to change,

588
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,448
it's a little bit too late

589
00:30:02,473 --> 00:30:03,557
because this is who I am.

590
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:19,269
Heh. I was starting to
think you might not show.

591
00:30:19,313 --> 00:30:21,288
I had some business to take care of.

592
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,226
So what's this weapon
that we're stealing?

593
00:30:25,293 --> 00:30:29,340
Who cares? All that matters
is that we're getting paid.

594
00:30:31,071 --> 00:30:32,593
You ready?

595
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:35,203
Absolutely.

596
00:30:40,594 --> 00:30:42,117
Manpower seems thin.

597
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:43,728
I thought we'd run into some guards.

598
00:30:43,771 --> 00:30:45,632
Why, do you think we're hitting it now?

599
00:30:45,832 --> 00:30:47,660
I'm gonna check out the south wing.

600
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,233
- You.
- Don't look surprised.

601
00:31:11,277 --> 00:31:13,584
Your friend's suit is
basically a giant tracker.

602
00:31:13,627 --> 00:31:16,587
And we happen to know somebody
who's very good with a computer.

603
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,327
You brought your little friend with you.

604
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:19,851
How typical.

605
00:31:19,876 --> 00:31:21,443
It's not too late, Laurel.

606
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,671
Don't do this.

607
00:31:22,696 --> 00:31:26,180
Ohh. That song of yours
is getting a little old.

608
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:43,687
Laurel!

609
00:31:43,712 --> 00:31:45,804
Ugh. God. You're here, too?

610
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:50,031
Do you know what Shadow Thief is
planning to do with that device?

611
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:52,361
Yes. Sell it for a lot of money

612
00:31:52,386 --> 00:31:53,866
of which I get half.

613
00:31:53,891 --> 00:31:56,024
Who do you think she's gonna sell it to,

614
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:57,224
the girl scouts?

615
00:31:57,445 --> 00:31:59,300
That device is gonna
be used to kill people.

616
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:01,859
Well, that's not really
my concern now, is it?

617
00:32:02,136 --> 00:32:03,312
- Move.
- No.

618
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,925
Seriously? Felicity, don't you think

619
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,917
you're just a little
bit out of your element?

620
00:32:07,942 --> 00:32:11,163
That is correct. I know
that, but so are you.

621
00:32:11,206 --> 00:32:13,992
Oh, for the love of God,
would you give it up already?

622
00:32:14,035 --> 00:32:16,821
This is who I am! Do you not see that?

623
00:32:16,864 --> 00:32:19,693
Who I see is someone that I believe in

624
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:22,111
and someone that I really care about.

625
00:32:22,193 --> 00:32:24,064
Felicity, what are you doing?

626
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:26,613
Forget living up to Laurel's legacy,

627
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,734
and forget being who
Lance wanted you to be.

628
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:33,687
- What do you want?
- I want you to get out of my way.

629
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,146
I guess if you're OK with
that device killing people,

630
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,409
you may as well start with me.

631
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:48,617
- Me, too.
- And me.

632
00:33:01,256 --> 00:33:05,217
I changed my mind. The deal's off.

633
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,916
I kind of expected. Good
thing I had a backup plan.

634
00:33:12,485 --> 00:33:13,834
We have to get out of here.

635
00:33:13,885 --> 00:33:15,811
Look. Is the payload device big enough
to clear out the building?

636
00:33:15,836 --> 00:33:17,828
Yes, but the problem
is we're inside the building.

637
00:33:17,853 --> 00:33:19,000
That's exactly why they
won't be expecting it.

638
00:33:19,025 --> 00:33:20,562
How long do you need to arm it?

639
00:33:20,587 --> 00:33:22,429
90 seconds. But how
are we gonna get out?

640
00:33:22,454 --> 00:33:24,960
Birds fly, don't they?
Let's buy her some time.

641
00:33:24,985 --> 00:33:27,814
Uh... go. Go.

642
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:49,174
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...

643
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:01,378
Come on, come on, come
on, come on. Come on.

644
00:34:08,836 --> 00:34:11,012
- Ohh!
- It's time to go.

645
00:34:11,037 --> 00:34:12,386
Stay close.

646
00:34:22,622 --> 00:34:24,972
Overwatch, now!

647
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,880
Can we never do that again?

648
00:34:42,923 --> 00:34:45,578
- Is everybody OK?
- You came back for me.

649
00:34:45,622 --> 00:34:48,015
We're only as strong as we are together,

650
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:50,185
something I didn't
realize till just now.

651
00:34:51,018 --> 00:34:53,560
We are pretty bad-ass together.

652
00:34:53,585 --> 00:34:55,013
Yeah. Like a birds of justice.

653
00:34:55,038 --> 00:34:56,692
Something like that.

654
00:35:09,914 --> 00:35:12,787
To ladies taking down ladies.

655
00:35:12,842 --> 00:35:15,888
Heh. And to Laurel.

656
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:17,566
Thank you for the assist,

657
00:35:17,629 --> 00:35:21,328
and I am very, very
sorry that I doubted you.

658
00:35:21,372 --> 00:35:22,685
That means a lot.

659
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:28,267
- I just wish we got Shadow Thief.
- We'll get her next time.

660
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,251
So does this mean you're
not gonna arrest me?

661
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,253
I don't see why I would.

662
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,909
This new evidence proves
you didn't kill Hernandez,

663
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,669
and you went undercover to bring down

664
00:35:38,694 --> 00:35:40,304
the Shadow Thief,

665
00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:43,245
so I am as surprised as anyone.

666
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,451
Thank you.

667
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,428
Now that Laurel Lance,
upstanding citizen,

668
00:35:46,453 --> 00:35:47,846
is back,

669
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:50,662
everything can go back to normal.

670
00:35:50,706 --> 00:35:54,131
Actually, it can't.

671
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:55,787
Say what, now?

672
00:35:56,799 --> 00:35:59,349
I am so tired of running.

673
00:35:59,845 --> 00:36:01,760
It's time for me to go home now.

674
00:36:01,823 --> 00:36:03,832
Home? As in Earth-2 home?

675
00:36:03,857 --> 00:36:07,175
Yeah. Someone in similar shoes told me

676
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,022
if I wanted to be one of the good guys

677
00:36:09,047 --> 00:36:10,788
that I needed to right my wrongs,

678
00:36:10,832 --> 00:36:12,398
and the only way to do that is to go

679
00:36:12,423 --> 00:36:14,404
back to where it all started.

680
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,795
Yeah.

681
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,654
Oh. Well, uh...

682
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:22,694
I'll cheers to that.

683
00:36:22,738 --> 00:36:24,295
- Yeah.
- Ah-ah.

684
00:36:24,803 --> 00:36:27,525
Heh. I think I deserve two of these.

685
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:29,850
I mean, come on. I worked
really hard, so there.

686
00:36:29,893 --> 00:36:31,373
Cheers to me.

687
00:36:34,184 --> 00:36:36,881
Oh, no. It's the SCPD.

688
00:36:37,381 --> 00:36:39,338
OK. Apparently, criminals don't care

689
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,321
how badly I need a girls' night.

690
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,982
I have something for you.

691
00:36:44,532 --> 00:36:47,256
From one Canary to another,

692
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:49,928
Sara wanted you to have this.

693
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:53,134
I can adjust it for you.

694
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,523
Probably get your cry
back if you want it.

695
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,499
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

696
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:10,046
- Yes, you are welcome.
- Thank you.

697
00:37:10,214 --> 00:37:11,387
No sweat.

698
00:37:11,943 --> 00:37:13,765
Did it all the time when
my sister was pregnant.

699
00:37:13,789 --> 00:37:15,051
Oh. Way to bury the lede.

700
00:37:15,094 --> 00:37:16,661
That's how you knew I was pregnant.

701
00:37:16,686 --> 00:37:17,949
Mm-hmm.

702
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:19,616
I have something for you.

703
00:37:26,334 --> 00:37:28,499
It's Laurel's Black Canary costume.

704
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:31,241
Yeah. Yeah. I thought
you could use it here,

705
00:37:31,284 --> 00:37:35,967
but, you know, maybe
Earth-2 needs a Black Canary.

706
00:37:37,092 --> 00:37:39,398
You are still planning
on being good, right?

707
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,990
I'm planning to try, yeah.

708
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:42,339
Good.

709
00:37:46,596 --> 00:37:48,250
I just really hope one day I'm

710
00:37:48,275 --> 00:37:50,451
actually worthy of it.

711
00:37:55,152 --> 00:37:58,092
Welcome home, Ms. Smoak.

712
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:01,140
Oh, you're home.

713
00:38:01,184 --> 00:38:03,357
I missed you.

714
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,920
Did you get what you were looking for?

715
00:38:06,406 --> 00:38:09,322
Yup. I'm exhausted.

716
00:38:09,366 --> 00:38:12,804
Just want to sit on the couch

717
00:38:12,848 --> 00:38:16,503
and order some food,
and... I don't know...

718
00:38:16,565 --> 00:38:18,132
I'll have whatever you're craving, OK?

719
00:38:18,157 --> 00:38:19,217
I already ate

720
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:20,951
after I said good-bye to Laurel.

721
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:24,367
So you found Laurel,

722
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:26,949
but you said good-bye to her already?

723
00:38:26,992 --> 00:38:28,994
Well, yeah, after we stopped her

724
00:38:29,038 --> 00:38:30,517
from going on a killing spree.

725
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:32,780
- Hmm?
- Dinah and Sara and I.

726
00:38:32,842 --> 00:38:34,496
- Hmm?
- Yeah. That Sara,

727
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:37,586
and we did it, super-easy, you know.

728
00:38:37,611 --> 00:38:39,309
It was like "Charlie's Angels"

729
00:38:39,352 --> 00:38:40,721
without the feathered
hair and casual sexism.

730
00:38:40,763 --> 00:38:42,330
So that whole taking it easy thing?

731
00:38:42,355 --> 00:38:44,490
Well, you know I'm not good at that.

732
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,449
Well, I'm here now, so
I'll take care of you.

733
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:51,871
Well, you could start with a foot rub.

734
00:38:53,453 --> 00:38:55,029
Yeah.

735
00:38:55,552 --> 00:38:57,163
Ahh.

736
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:03,700
We keep this up, people
are gonna start asking

737
00:39:03,725 --> 00:39:06,029
why we keep hanging out in cemeteries.

738
00:39:08,803 --> 00:39:10,506
I was never very good at good-byes.

739
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:15,475
Quentin always saw the good in me

740
00:39:15,515 --> 00:39:17,560
when... when nobody else did.

741
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:21,829
I wish I could tell him
how much it meant to me.

742
00:39:21,854 --> 00:39:23,178
He knew.

743
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:27,349
He was the first person to make
me feel like I was never alone.

744
00:39:28,154 --> 00:39:32,985
You're not alone, not anymore.

745
00:40:02,305 --> 00:40:03,915
So much for plan "A".

746
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:20,431
Unh.

747
00:40:40,212 --> 00:40:41,735
Whoa.

748
00:40:42,867 --> 00:40:45,087
But I've seen you before.

749
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:47,865
The old Green Arrow documentary.

750
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:51,771
- You're...
- A friend of your parents.

751
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:55,532
You're lucky we got here when we did.

752
00:40:55,763 --> 00:40:59,293
Dinah sent you to watch my back.

753
00:40:59,513 --> 00:41:01,211
It's what Canaries do.

754
00:41:06,287 --> 00:41:08,071
Give this to Felicity.

755
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:13,115
You look so much like her,

756
00:41:13,158 --> 00:41:15,568
and you may not be a Canary,

757
00:41:16,205 --> 00:41:18,207
and you still have a long way to go

758
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,763
to prove that you're a hero.

759
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:22,809
Take it from someone who
knows how hard it can be,

760
00:41:23,056 --> 00:41:24,710
and don't screw it up.

761
00:41:36,459 --> 00:41:41,459
