1
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:09,946
Please verify that the P1 ATA removal on
replacement cap part 1 and 2 are complete.

2
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,576
DMA M1, M2, M3 and M4 are complete.

3
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:17,328
Okay. Copy that, Explorer.

4
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,748
Dr. Stone, Houston.

5
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,791
Medical is concerned about 
your ECG readings.

6
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:24,711
I'm fine, Houston.

7
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:28,798
Well, Medical doesn't agree, doc. 
Are you feeling nauseous?

8
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:32,677
Not any more than usual, Houston.
Diagnostics are green.

9
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:36,264
Link to communications card
ready for data reception.

10
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:41,060
If this works, when we touch down tomorrow,
I'm buying all you guys a round of drinks.

11
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:42,604
That's a date, doctor.

12
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:46,483
Just remember,
Houston's partial to margaritas.

13
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:49,903
Booting comms card now.

14
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:51,780
Please confirm link.

15
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:55,533
That's a negative, 
we're not seeing any data.

16
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:58,536
Stand by, Houston,
I'm gonna reboot the comms card.

17
00:01:58,787 --> 00:01:59,746
Standing by.

18
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:02,832
Houston,
I have a bad feeling about this mission.

19
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:04,584
Please expand.

20
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:06,628
Okay, let me tell you a story.

21
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:10,215
It was '96. I'd been up here for 42 days.

22
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:13,051
Every time I passed over Texas,
I looked down,

23
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:17,305
knowing that Mrs. Kowalski
was looking up, thinking of me.

24
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,225
Six weeks I'm blowing kisses at that woman.

25
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:23,937
Then we land at Edwards and I find out
that she's run off with this lawyer.

26
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:26,064
So I packed my car, and I headed to-

27
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:28,983
Tijuana. You've told this story, Kowalski.

28
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:33,112
As Houston recalls,
she, uh, took off in your '74 GTO.

29
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:36,699
Engineering requests fuel status on 
the jetpack prototype.

30
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,495
Five hours off the reservation
and I show 30 percent drain.

31
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,579
Give my compliments to Engineering.

32
00:02:42,604 --> 00:02:45,433
Except for a slight malfunction
in the nulling of the roll axis,

33
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,820
this jetpack is one prime piece of thrust.

34
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,587
Engineering says thank you.

35
00:02:50,612 --> 00:02:52,948
Tell them I still prefer
my '67 Corvette, though.

36
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:54,691
Speaking of which, did I ever tell you-

37
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,382
We know the Corvette story.

38
00:02:56,745 --> 00:02:58,080
Even Engineering?

39
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:00,223
Especially Engineering.

40
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:02,934
We're going to miss you, Matt.

41
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,562
Comms card reboot in progress.

42
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:06,896
Thank you, doctor.

43
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,107
Shariff, what's your status?

44
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:13,361
Nearly there.
Replacing battery module A 1 and C.

45
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,780
Could you be a little more specific?

46
00:03:16,806 --> 00:03:19,184
Indeterminate estimates
make Houston anxious.

47
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:22,445
No, no, no, Houston. Don't be anxious.

48
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,747
Anxiety's not good for the heart.

49
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:27,171
System is ready to reactivate.

50
00:03:28,144 --> 00:03:31,031
Hubble telescope engaged.
Upgrade fully functional.

51
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,234
That applause you hear is for you, Shariff.

52
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:37,359
Congratulations.
Kick back, take the rest of the day off.

53
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:47,270
Matt, do you have a visual on just what
Mission Specialist Shariff is doing up there?

54
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,523
He appears to be doing
some form of the Macarena.

55
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:54,319
But that would be just 
a best-guess scenario on my part.

56
00:03:54,537 --> 00:03:56,163
Dr. Stone, Houston.

57
00:03:56,446 --> 00:04:01,625
Medical now have you with a temperature
drop to 35.9 and a heart-rate rise to 70.

58
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:04,258
How are you feeling?

59
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,000
Houston, I'm fine.

60
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:09,757
It's just keeping your lunch down in zero-G
is harder than it looks.

61
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:14,336
Dr. Stone, Medical is asking if
you want to return to Explorer.

62
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,067
Negative. We've been here a week, Houston. 
Let's just finish this. Ahem.

63
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,510
Card is up.

64
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:21,742
No, that's a negative.

65
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:24,836
I'm afraid we're getting nothing on 
this end, doctor.

66
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:27,244
Try again.

67
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,468
No, still nothing.

68
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:33,608
Houston, can you please
turn that music off?

69
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:35,062
Kowalski.

70
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,028
Not a problem.

71
00:04:37,191 --> 00:04:38,693
Thank you, Kowalski.

72
00:04:42,154 --> 00:04:43,492
Now, Houston?

73
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:45,468
That's a negative.

74
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:48,242
Could Houston be misinterpreting the data?

75
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:51,125
Well, we're not receiving any data.

76
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:55,921
Engineering is recommending
a vis-check for component damage.

77
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:58,695
Let me see what's going on.

78
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,386
What have we got?

79
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:11,828
Visual examination doesn't reveal
any damaged components.

80
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,606
The problem must be originating
from the comms panel.

81
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:17,026
Yeah, that seems to be the case.

82
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,697
Engineering admits that you warned us
that this could happen.

83
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:23,863
That's as close to an apology
as you're going to get from them.

84
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:25,681
We should have listened to you, doc.

85
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:28,539
Well, looks like
we're going to have to improvise.

86
00:05:28,564 --> 00:05:29,732
I'm on it.

87
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,624
How long do you think it'll take you?

88
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:34,401
One hour. Ahem.

89
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:35,837
Outstanding.

90
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,093
Installing your system in the Hubble
is the purpose of this mission,

91
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:41,287
and so we appreciate your patience, doctor.

92
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:44,986
Kowalski, we know you don't care
about things like this,

93
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,307
but, uh, for your information,
this delay is not going to be long enough

94
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:51,140
for you to break 
Anatoly Solovyev's spacewalking record.

95
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,878
It seems like you're gonna be left-

96
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:54,437
Seventy-five minutes shy?

97
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:56,816
Never crossed my mind.

98
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,526
Matt...

99
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:00,862
...it's been a privilege.

100
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:03,031
Right back at you, Houston.

101
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,366
Enjoy your last walk.

102
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:09,120
Am I a go to assist Dr. Stone
in removing the panel?

103
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,748
- Assistance appreciated.
- Permission granted.

104
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:13,984
Thank you, Houston. Agh.

105
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:15,768
Mind if I join the fun?

106
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:16,769
Certainly.

107
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,296
How you feeling?

108
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:22,145
Like a Chihuahua that's being tumble-dried.

109
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,068
Well, it's been a rough week.

110
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:30,101
If it makes you feel any better, I coughed up
everything but my kidneys on my first ride.

111
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:31,664
Shit.

112
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:34,161
Ah. Ah. Unh.

113
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,317
- Ha, ha.
- Sorry.

114
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:44,289
I'm used to a basement lab in a hospital
where things fall to the floor.

115
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,929
Thank you.

116
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,320
Well, you're the genius up here.

117
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,911
I only drive the bus.

118
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:54,757
Yeah, well, call me a genius if I can get
this board initialized in the next hour.

119
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,417
Explorer, this is Houston.

120
00:06:56,976 --> 00:06:58,343
Go ahead, Houston.

121
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:01,997
NORAD reports a Russian satellite 
has incurred a missile strike.

122
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,512
The impact has created a cloud of debris
orbiting at 20,000 miles per hour.

123
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,203
Current debris orbit does not overlap
with your trajectory.

124
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:13,437
We'll keep you posted on any developments.

125
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,187
Copy that, Houston.

126
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:17,554
Should we be worried?

127
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,817
No, let's let the boys down there
worry for us.

128
00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:25,088
Explorer, engage arm and pivot
to cargo bay.

129
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:26,572
Stand by for arm maneuver.

130
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:27,792
Aah.

131
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:31,398
So, doc, now that you work for NASA,
how do you like us?

132
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:33,640
Kind of like winning the lottery, huh?

133
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:37,078
I was just happy that they didn't cut
the funding to my research.

134
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:39,328
- How long was your training?
- Oh, six months.

135
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,289
- Including holidays?
-  Uh-huh.

136
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,375
So, what is this scanning system?

137
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,691
Oh, nothing, Matt.

138
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,469
It's just a new set of eyes to
scan the edge of the universe.

139
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:51,859
It's designed for hospital use,
but this one's a prototype.

140
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:53,586
Stand by for locking.

141
00:07:53,611 --> 00:07:56,864
- Unh.
- Listen, they don't bankroll prototypes.

142
00:07:57,492 --> 00:07:59,814
Even for your pretty blue eyes.

143
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:03,195
Well, my eyes are brown.

144
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:07,155
Right now, your eyes are bloodshot.

145
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:10,953
Kowalski! Is this great or what?

146
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:18,541
And to think he went to Harvard.

147
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:22,879
You gotta admit one thing:

148
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,756
Can't beat the view.

149
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:32,054
So, what do you like about being up here?

150
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:35,641
The silence.

151
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,187
I could get used to it.

152
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:01,156
Terrific.

153
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,462
Houston, from first inspection,
comms panel appears to be dead.

154
00:09:04,618 --> 00:09:07,079
Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary?

155
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,937
You're the expert, doctor. It's your call.

156
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:12,509
Houston, I have a bad feeling
about this mission.

157
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,263
Please elaborate.

158
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:18,015
It's the same feeling 
I had about Mardi Gras in 1987.

159
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,228
That is affirmative.

160
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:23,606
Surprisingly, Control hasn't heard
the Mardi Gras story.

161
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:25,326
Please proceed.

162
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:28,706
Well, it's day one, and I'm bumping
my way down Bourbon Street,

163
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:31,113
looking for a sister of a friend of mine.

164
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:35,062
Streets are full of people, I'm thinking
there's no way I'm gonna find this girl.

165
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:36,492
Proceeding to override.

166
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:40,484
Then all of a sudden, I look up
and there she is. I'm about to yell out.

167
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:45,382
I see she's holding hands with some hairy guy
in board shorts and a Margaritaville shirt.

168
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:48,773
And then I realize that 
this guy is not a guy.

169
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,841
That my girl is holding hands with-

170
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:52,701
ISS, this is Houston.

171
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:55,780
- Explorer, this is Houston.
- Go ahead, Houston.

172
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:58,641
Mission abort. Repeat, mission abort.

173
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:02,186
Initiate emergency disconnect from Hubble.
Begin reentry procedure.

174
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:04,482
ISS, initiate emergency evacuation.

175
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:06,398
Copy all, Houston, and in work.

176
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:10,280
Matt, immediate return to Explorer.
Repeat, immediate return to Explorer.

177
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,480
Copy. Explorer, prep airlock.

178
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,347
- Airlock engaged, ready to receive.
- Houston, elaborate.

179
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,369
Debris from the missile strike
has caused a chain reaction,

180
00:10:18,394 --> 00:10:20,997
hitting other satellites
and creating new debris.

181
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:25,416
Traveling faster than a high-speed bullet
up towards your altitude. All copy.

182
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:26,706
Copy all.

183
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:28,252
Put a bow on it, Dr. Stone.

184
00:10:28,405 --> 00:10:31,825
I can't. The board is still initializing.

185
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:34,510
- I'm not gonna ask you again.
- One second.

186
00:10:34,697 --> 00:10:37,825
Not one second. Now. Shut it down.

187
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,765
That's an order.

188
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:42,518
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm done.
I'm done.

189
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,354
Kowalski, initiate emergency
disconnect from the Hubble.

190
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,888
- All right, Shariff, let's do this.
- Roger, Matt.

191
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:49,233
Houston, update.

192
00:10:49,397 --> 00:10:51,233
Well, we have a full-on chain reaction.

193
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,988
It's been confirmed that it's the
unintentional side effect of the Russians

194
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:56,979
striking one of their own satellites.

195
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:59,596
- They shot down their own satellite?
- Right of disposal.

196
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:02,745
Most likely a spy sat gone bad.
Now it's shrapnel.

197
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:04,745
Explorer, ready to disengage HST.

198
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,112
Locks releasing in three, two, one.

199
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:11,380
Explorer, new data coming through.

200
00:11:11,606 --> 00:11:13,333
What's the blowback, Houston?

201
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,093
It's not good. 
Most of our systems are gone.

202
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:19,764
Debris chain reaction is out of control
and rapidly expanding.

203
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:22,713
Multiple satellites are down
and they keep on falling.

204
00:11:22,738 --> 00:11:24,348
Define "multiple satellites".

205
00:11:24,373 --> 00:11:27,910
Most of them are gone.
Telecommunication systems are dead.

206
00:11:28,144 --> 00:11:30,364
Expect a communication blackout
at any moment.

207
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,610
Kowalski, visual of debris at 9 o'clock.

208
00:11:32,773 --> 00:11:35,025
Half of North America
just lost their Facebook.

209
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:36,700
Explorer, repeat.

210
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,699
Expect a communication blackout
at any moment.

211
00:11:39,945 --> 00:11:41,405
Copy that, Houston.

212
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,039
Explorer, this is Kowalski,
confirming visual contact with debris.

213
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:46,583
Debris is from a BSE sat.

214
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,542
- Heads up!
- To repeat, I have-

215
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:51,122
Dr. Stone requesting faster transport.

216
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:52,880
We have to go. We have to go, go, go!

217
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:55,908
Kennedy reports
meteorological conditions no-go...

218
00:11:56,653 --> 00:11:58,030
Houston, Explorer. Copy.

219
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,346
Explorer, Dr. Stone requesting
faster transport to bay area.

220
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,865
Explorer, do you copy?

221
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,853
Explorer, permission to retrieve Dr. Stone.

222
00:12:04,877 --> 00:12:06,310
You're a go, Kowalski.

223
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:09,105
Houston, this is Explorer, copy.

224
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,190
- All right.
- We've lost Houston.

225
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,292
- Unh!
- We've lost Houston.

226
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,403
Unstrap. 
Look, we need to get the hell out of here.

227
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:18,672
- Need some help there, Matt?
- No, don't wait for us.

228
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:19,794
- Unh!
- It's stuck!

229
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:22,618
Man down! Man down!

230
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,262
Houston, this is Explorer, copy.

231
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,497
Kowalski, repor-

232
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,251
Explorer's been hit. Explorer, do you read?

233
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,504
Explorer, over. Explorer.

234
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:40,392
Astronaut is off structure.
Dr. Stone is off structure.

235
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:43,264
- Dr. Stone, detach! You must detach!
- No!

236
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:46,102
If you don't detach,
that arm's gonna carry you too far!

237
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:48,686
- Listen to my voice! You need to focus!
- I can't!

238
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:52,132
I'm losing visual of you. In a few seconds,
 I won't be able to track you.

239
00:12:52,157 --> 00:12:53,482
You need to detach!

240
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:57,186
- I can't see you anymore. Do it now!
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

241
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:01,275
Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone.

242
00:13:02,894 --> 00:13:05,647
Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone.

243
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,796
Dr. Stone, do you copy?

244
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,381
Repeat, do you copy?

245
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,718
- Yes, yes, yes, I copy! I'm detached!
- Give me your position.

246
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:23,387
I don't know! I don't know,
I'm spinning! I can't-

247
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,010
Report your position.

248
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:27,955
GPS is down. I can't- It's down, I can't-

249
00:13:28,322 --> 00:13:29,381
Give me a visual.

250
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:31,437
I told you, nothing. I see nothing!

251
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:33,201
Do you have a visual of Explorer?

252
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:33,789
No.

253
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,274
Do you have a visual of ISS?

254
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:35,759
No.

255
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,297
You need to focus. Anything, use
the sun and the Earth, give me coordinates.

256
00:13:39,322 --> 00:13:41,867
- I can't breathe! I can't breathe!
- Give me coordinates!

257
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:44,700
Dr. Stone, do you copy?

258
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,912
Kowalski? Kowalski, do you copy?

259
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,035
Kowals- I have a vis-
Kowalski, I have a visual.

260
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:49,838
I have a visual of Explorer.

261
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:57,064
With north at 12 o'clock and 
the shuttle is at the center of the dial.

262
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:02,194
I can see the Chinese station.

263
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,698
No, it's the International Space Station.

264
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:07,908
ISS is at...

265
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:11,704
ISS is at <i>7</i> o'clock.

266
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:21,797
Lieutenant Kowalski, do you copy?

267
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:29,430
Explorer, do you copy?

268
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,774
Houston, do you copy?

269
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,240
Houston, 
this is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone.

270
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:52,229
I am off structure and I am drifting.
Do you copy?

271
00:15:58,611 --> 00:15:59,904
Anyone?

272
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:05,576
Anybody?

273
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,637
Do you copy?

274
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:15,184
Please copy.

275
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:18,771
Please.

276
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:39,917
Dr. Stone, do you copy?

277
00:16:40,143 --> 00:16:43,229
Yeah, Lieutenant Kowalski, yes.
Yes, Lieutenant Kowalski, I'm here!

278
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,632
- Repeat, do you copy?
- Yes, yes, I copy, I'm here. I'm here.

279
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:48,175
Flash your light.

280
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,803
- My light?
- Flash it so I can see you.

281
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:52,221
Okay.

282
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:58,143
Okay, okay. Here, here! I'm here!

283
00:16:58,394 --> 00:17:00,604
There you are. Hang on tight.

284
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,482
Report your status.

285
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:04,589
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm all right.

286
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:06,847
Your status. Give me your readings.

287
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,862
Three... Three...

288
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:11,156
Three-point-six PSI.

289
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:13,534
Your O2, give me your O2.

290
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:17,788
Oxygen is going down. It's going
down fast. It's going down fast. Nine-

291
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:19,707
No, 8 percent.

292
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,464
You're breathing too fast.

293
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:23,691
You're burning oxygen,
and we don't wanna do that.

294
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,540
We wanna relax. Copy?

295
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:27,423
Okay, sorry. Yes, copy.

296
00:17:27,602 --> 00:17:30,021
- All right. Nearly there.
- Copy. Please hurry.

297
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,339
You can holster that torch, Dr. Stone.

298
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:35,441
Sorry. Sorry.

299
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,145
- Aah!
- Gotcha.

300
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:44,523
All right, now I'm gonna tether you to me.

301
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:49,820
I know, you never realized
how devastatingly good-looking I am.

302
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,782
But I need you to stop staring
and help me with the tether.

303
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:54,992
Okay?

304
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,994
Okay. Okay.

305
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:59,246
Uh, I got it.

306
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,915
All right, here we go.

307
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,335
Now, to clear you from the jets,
I'm gonna give you a little push.

308
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,254
- No, no, no.
- Not a push.

309
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:08,339
A nudge.

310
00:18:08,364 --> 00:18:10,808
No, no, no! Damn it, no!

311
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:21,824
See? Where you go, I go.

312
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:28,660
Better.

313
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,176
Let's get out of here.

314
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:36,116
- Goddamn it! Agh.
- I know what you mean.

315
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:37,977
Damn it.

316
00:18:38,002 --> 00:18:39,837
You're burning oxygen.

317
00:18:40,305 --> 00:18:43,975
We're going back to the shuttle.
How's that for a plan? Copy?

318
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,083
Fuck!

319
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,877
Right. Copy that.

320
00:18:47,346 --> 00:18:49,223
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.

321
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:51,707
Dr. Stone and I are gonna
make our way back to base.

322
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:55,050
Can you get the Explorer to prepare
the airlock for arrival? Copy?

323
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:59,113
Houston, this is Kowalski. How do you copy?

324
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:02,100
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.

325
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:03,582
They can't hear us.

326
00:19:03,607 --> 00:19:05,860
We don't know that.
That's why we keep talking.

327
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:09,097
If somebody is listening,
they might just save your life.

328
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,610
Set your watch for 90 minutes.

329
00:19:12,415 --> 00:19:13,589
Why 90?

330
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:16,878
Well, Houston clocked that debris
at 50,000 miles an hour.

331
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,742
If you factor in our current orbit,

332
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:22,396
then I figure we got about 90 minutes
before we get our asses kicked again.

333
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:24,256
O2 down to 6 percent.

334
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:29,192
Okay. Pretty scary shit
being untethered up here, isn't it?

335
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:32,628
Yeah, pretty scary shit.

336
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:35,039
Well, you did all right.

337
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,430
Well, you weren't so bad yourself.

338
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,436
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.

339
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:52,151
Our current location is approximately
900 meters out from the Explorer.

340
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:57,240
Dr. Stone and I would like to retrieve
the body of Mission Specialist Shariff

341
00:19:57,265 --> 00:19:59,271
and return it to the shuttle.

342
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:01,256
Am I a go to retrieve?

343
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,205
Roger that.

344
00:20:05,384 --> 00:20:07,232
Where is he?

345
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,608
Oh, my God.

346
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,862
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

347
00:20:41,371 --> 00:20:42,538
Grab him!

348
00:20:45,855 --> 00:20:47,106
Grab him! Agh!

349
00:20:47,131 --> 00:20:48,490
I'm trying, I'm trying!

350
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:54,730
You're pulling me away.

351
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:55,850
I got him!

352
00:20:56,052 --> 00:20:58,346
- Clutch him like he's your valentine.
- I got him.

353
00:20:58,371 --> 00:21:01,374
I can't engage my thrust
with you two yo-yoing around.

354
00:21:31,718 --> 00:21:33,345
Jesus Christ.

355
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,880
Here's hoping you have a hell
of an insurance policy, Houston.

356
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:41,464
The damages to Explorer are catastrophic.

357
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:43,637
Will commence search for survivors.

358
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,738
O2 down to 5 percent.

359
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:48,894
All right, here we go. 
Careful of the edges!

360
00:21:57,595 --> 00:21:59,220
Here. Here!

361
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,040
Houston, in the blind. To confirm:

362
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:57,269
Mission Specialist Dr. Stone and
Mission Commander Matthew Kowalski

363
00:22:57,294 --> 00:23:01,006
are the sole survivors of the STS-157.

364
00:23:03,198 --> 00:23:04,776
I apologize for not complying.

365
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,382
I should've stopped working
as soon as you instructed me to.

366
00:23:07,407 --> 00:23:09,202
We were gonna get hit no matter what.

367
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:11,670
There was nothing you could do
to change that.

368
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:16,655
Hey.

369
00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:18,374
Yes?

370
00:23:18,692 --> 00:23:19,860
All right...

371
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:22,819
...we have to make our way
to the space station.

372
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,322
Over there.

373
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,199
It's a bit of a hike,

374
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,204
but we need to use their escape pod,
the Soyuz, to get back to Earth.

375
00:23:32,631 --> 00:23:33,799
Agreed?

376
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,770
Dr. Stone...

377
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,710
...agreed?

378
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:41,304
Agreed.

379
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,772
All right. After you.

380
00:23:45,837 --> 00:23:47,210
Oh, God.

381
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:59,564
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.

382
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:06,571
Dr. Stone and I have determined to proceed to
ISS and use one of their Soyuz for reentry.

383
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,444
ISS, if you hear us...

384
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,369
...we could sure use a rescue mission.

385
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:28,468
O2 down to 2 percent.

386
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:30,248
We're getting there.

387
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,348
Beautiful, don't you think?

388
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,059
What?

389
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:37,853
The sunrise.

390
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,439
That's what I'm gonna miss the most.

391
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,239
So where's home, Dr. Stone?

392
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,369
Ryan, where's home?

393
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,747
- Home?
- Mm-hm.

394
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,084
Down there. Mother Earth.

395
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:03,529
Where do you pitch your tent?

396
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:08,717
Lake Zurich.

397
00:25:09,123 --> 00:25:10,708
Where the hell is that?

398
00:25:13,932 --> 00:25:14,975
Illinois.

399
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:18,213
Illinois. Central time zone.

400
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:23,273
That would make it roughly... 8 p.m.

401
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:26,902
What are the good people of Lake Zurich
doing at 8:00?

402
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,696
I don't know.

403
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,616
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm slowing you down.

404
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:34,409
What would you be doing?

405
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:40,999
Come on, Ryan. It's 8:00.

406
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:44,639
You've just left the hospital
after an 18-hour shift.

407
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:46,546
Driving home.

408
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,635
The radio.

409
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:55,472
I listen to the radio.

410
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:59,771
There we go. Let me guess. NPR?

411
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,967
Classical? Top 40?

412
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:10,240
Anything. I don't care,
as long as they don't talk. I just drive.

413
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,823
And where are you driving to?

414
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,611
I just drive.

415
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:21,424
What do you miss down there?

416
00:26:22,962 --> 00:26:24,839
Is there a Mr. Stone?

417
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,451
No.

418
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,297
Nobody special?

419
00:26:32,446 --> 00:26:36,554
Somebody down there looking up
thinking about you?

420
00:26:38,752 --> 00:26:39,920
Ryan?

421
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,692
I had a daughter.

422
00:26:59,507 --> 00:27:01,176
She was 4.

423
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:05,125
She was at school playing tag.

424
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,251
Slipped, hit her head, and that was it.

425
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:12,632
Stupidest thing.

426
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:21,627
I was driving when I got the call, so...

427
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,363
Ever since then, that's what I do.

428
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:27,786
I wake up...

429
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,525
...I go to work...

430
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:32,610
...and I just drive.

431
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,973
O2 down to 1 percent.

432
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,335
Well, I've got good news and bad news.

433
00:28:16,503 --> 00:28:18,968
The good news is, we're about 5 minutes
from the ISS

434
00:28:18,993 --> 00:28:21,576
and I know where the Russians
stash their vodka.

435
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:24,819
And that is good,
because I'm running on fumes here.

436
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:29,538
The bad news is I'm gonna be about 10 minutes
short of breaking Anatoly's record, and-

437
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:32,218
- Agh!
- What?

438
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:35,304
I'm redlining. My O2 tank pressure is low.

439
00:28:35,866 --> 00:28:38,663
Your tank is out of oxygen,
but you still have it in your suit.

440
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:39,511
Got it.

441
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,202
So you have to sip, not gulp.

442
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,937
Wine, not beer.

443
00:28:44,231 --> 00:28:45,640
Sip, Ryan.

444
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:49,621
Houston, in the blind,
we have a visual of the ISS.

445
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:53,415
The station must have been evacuated
because the first Soyuz is missing.

446
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,779
The second Soyuz exhibits surface damage
and its chute has been deployed.

447
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:01,616
Any use as an escape pod for reentry
is impossible.

448
00:29:01,936 --> 00:29:04,272
Shouldn't we be turning?
We're drifting again.

449
00:29:04,397 --> 00:29:07,101
Not yet.
I wasn't kidding about those fumes.

450
00:29:07,126 --> 00:29:11,251
This can has one or 
two good thrusts left... if we're lucky.

451
00:29:23,938 --> 00:29:25,148
Steady.

452
00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:36,140
Aim.

453
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,879
Fire.

454
00:29:44,095 --> 00:29:45,958
Brake! Brake. You have to brake!

455
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,661
I can't, the can's empty.

456
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:50,168
We're gonna hit hard. 
Grab ahold of anything you can!

457
00:30:02,225 --> 00:30:03,590
What do I do?

458
00:30:04,665 --> 00:30:06,166
What do I do?

459
00:30:15,424 --> 00:30:16,008
Ryan!

460
00:30:21,306 --> 00:30:23,559
The tether broke, I'm detached!

461
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:24,911
I'm detached!

462
00:30:24,936 --> 00:30:26,187
Grab ahold!

463
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:29,621
Grab anything!

464
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:47,305
Ryan!

465
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,559
- Give me five.
- I've got you.

466
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:53,895
I've got you. Right here.

467
00:30:57,484 --> 00:30:58,527
Shit!

468
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,028
No, no, no!

469
00:31:02,674 --> 00:31:03,675
Got you.

470
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:14,018
Got you.

471
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:19,807
You just hold on,
and I'm gonna start pulling you in.

472
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:20,963
Hey, doc.

473
00:31:20,988 --> 00:31:22,573
Just hold on. Hang on.

474
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,927
I am gonna pull you in.

475
00:31:23,952 --> 00:31:26,525
Ryan, listen. You have to let me go.

476
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,064
- No.
- The ropes are too loose.

477
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:29,244
I'm pulling you with me.

478
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:32,267
- Let me go or we both die.
- I'm not letting you go!

479
00:31:32,525 --> 00:31:33,580
We're fine!

480
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,144
- Agh!
- No.

481
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:41,651
Ryan, let go.

482
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,554
No.

483
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,072
You're not going anywhere.
You're not going anywhere.

484
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:48,866
- It's not up to you.
- No, no, no.

485
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:51,226
Please don't do this.

486
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:53,578
Please, please, please. 
Please don't do this.

487
00:31:53,603 --> 00:31:56,007
Please don't do this. No, no, no.
Please don't, Matt.

488
00:31:56,032 --> 00:31:57,658
Please don't do this.

489
00:32:01,071 --> 00:32:02,823
You're gonna make it, Ryan.

490
00:32:04,081 --> 00:32:05,291
No!

491
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:29,991
I had you. I had you. I had you.

492
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:47,301
Ryan, do you hear me?

493
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:51,554
Do you copy?

494
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:55,617
My CO2 alarm went off.
My CO2 alarm went off.

495
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:57,685
Look, you need to board the station.

496
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:59,854
Do you see the airlock?

497
00:33:09,115 --> 00:33:10,450
Hey, Ryan.

498
00:33:11,563 --> 00:33:12,940
You copy?

499
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:16,245
Look for the airlock.

500
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:21,724
It's above you, next to the Zarya module.

501
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:26,631
You see it?

502
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:29,896
Yes. Yes, I see it. I see it.

503
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:33,221
All right, good. That's where you wanna go.

504
00:33:33,653 --> 00:33:35,807
Now you're getting light-headed, right?

505
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:37,684
Yeah. Yes.

506
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:42,271
That's because you're breathing CO2.
You're losing consciousness.

507
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:44,169
You need to board the station.

508
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:45,400
Okay.

509
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,904
That second Soyuz is
too damaged for reentry,

510
00:33:48,928 --> 00:33:51,817
but it's perfectly fine
for a little Sunday drive.

511
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:53,349
Sunday drive?

512
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:55,576
Look to the west.

513
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:59,021
You see that dot in the distance?

514
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:00,790
That's a Chinese station.

515
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,016
Yes.

516
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:05,044
You're gonna take the Soyuz,
and you're gonna cruise over there.

517
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:08,881
Chinese lifeboat is a Shenzhou.

518
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:11,067
I've never flown a Shenzhou.

519
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:15,680
It doesn't matter. Its reentry protocol 
is identical to the Soyuz.

520
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,932
Okay.

521
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,091
You never flown the Soyuz either?

522
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:24,063
Only a simulator.

523
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:26,341
Well, then you know.

524
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,069
But I crashed it.

525
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:33,314
It's a simulator, 
that's what it's designed for.

526
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:39,412
Every time. I crashed it every time.

527
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,923
You point the damn thing at Earth. 
It's not rocket science.

528
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:47,795
And by this time tomorrow, you're gonna be back
in Lake Zurich with a hell of a story to tell.

529
00:34:48,663 --> 00:34:49,998
You copy?

530
00:34:51,765 --> 00:34:53,308
Ryan, you copy?

531
00:34:53,637 --> 00:34:55,798
I'm gonna take the Soyuz and come get you.

532
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,597
No, you're not.

533
00:34:56,613 --> 00:34:59,283
- I'm coming to get you.
- I've got too much of a head start.

534
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:02,544
- I'm coming to get you.
- I'm afraid that ship already sailed.

535
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:06,063
Ryan, you're gonna have to learn to let go.

536
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:07,458
But I-

537
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,818
I wanna hear you say you're gonna make it.

538
00:35:11,803 --> 00:35:13,513
Come on, Ryan, say it.

539
00:35:15,476 --> 00:35:16,894
I'm gonna make it.

540
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:18,796
All right. Keep going.

541
00:35:20,223 --> 00:35:23,231
What kind of a name is Ryan for a girl?

542
00:35:24,701 --> 00:35:26,327
Dad wanted a boy.

543
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:29,046
Are you close to the airlock?

544
00:35:29,851 --> 00:35:31,061
Not yet.

545
00:35:31,086 --> 00:35:32,421
Keep going.

546
00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:35,831
So now that we have some distance
between us,

547
00:35:35,856 --> 00:35:37,678
you're attracted to me, right?

548
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:38,863
What?

549
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:42,433
Well, people say 
I have beautiful blue eyes.

550
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,526
You have beautiful...
You have beautiful blue eyes.

551
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,140
I have brown eyes.

552
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:57,532
Hey, you wanna know the good news?

553
00:35:57,782 --> 00:35:58,716
What?

554
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,661
I'm gonna break Anatoly's record

555
00:36:00,686 --> 00:36:03,137
and I think mine's gonna stand for 
a long, long time.

556
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,933
Oh, no. I'm coming to get you.

557
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,184
Oh, my God.

558
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:12,066
What? What?

559
00:36:12,263 --> 00:36:13,495
Wow.

560
00:36:15,127 --> 00:36:16,503
Hey, Ryan?

561
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:17,927
Yeah?

562
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:20,152
You should see the sun on the Ganges.

563
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,517
It's amazing.

564
00:40:50,644 --> 00:40:53,677
Where are you? Where are you?
Comms. Comms.

565
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:55,412
There you are. Okay.

566
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:08,175
Matt, this is Ryan, copy.

567
00:41:11,121 --> 00:41:13,706
Matt, this is Ryan, copy.

568
00:41:16,788 --> 00:41:20,583
Matt, I made it, I'm here,
I'm on the station. Do you copy?

569
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,571
Come on, Matt, talk to me.

570
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:31,490
Tell me where you are,
give me your position.

571
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:36,078
Where are you? Give me a visual.
Just tell me what you see.

572
00:41:40,814 --> 00:41:43,761
Oh, come on. You've been yammering
since we left Cape Canaveral.

573
00:41:43,786 --> 00:41:45,824
Now you decide to shut up? Talk to me.

574
00:41:46,156 --> 00:41:49,117
Just say something, say anything.
I don't care.

575
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:56,268
Hey...

576
00:41:57,755 --> 00:42:01,009
Tell me about, uh, Mardi Gras.
Tell me about the hairy guy.

577
00:42:01,172 --> 00:42:05,566
Huh? Tell me what happened.
What happened to the, uh, hairy guy?

578
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:13,365
Please talk to me.

579
00:42:17,873 --> 00:42:19,207
Please.

580
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:36,777
Houston, in the blind...

581
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:43,103
...this is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone
reporting from the ISS.

582
00:42:45,022 --> 00:42:49,568
All communications with Mission Commander
Matthew Kowalski have been lost.

583
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,949
Radio transmission absent.

584
00:42:56,997 --> 00:42:58,832
Visuals nonexistent.

585
00:43:01,435 --> 00:43:03,020
To confirm,

586
00:43:03,733 --> 00:43:09,546
l, Ryan Stone, am the sole survivor
of STS-157.

587
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:24,186
What now?

588
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:01,993
Okay.

589
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:08,180
Okay. Where is it, where is it?
Where is the power?

590
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,257
Here you are.

591
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:13,962
Okay, great, just like training.

592
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:16,711
Undocking, undocking.

593
00:45:17,091 --> 00:45:18,425
Undocking.

594
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:20,636
Red.

595
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:27,101
Okay.

596
00:45:29,228 --> 00:45:30,979
Okay, where is it?

597
00:45:31,344 --> 00:45:32,352
Where is it?

598
00:45:33,153 --> 00:45:34,320
Come on.

599
00:45:35,054 --> 00:45:36,312
Okay.

600
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:42,366
Okay. Okay, I remember this.
I remember this.

601
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,341
Oh, you don't have four minutes.
We're going manual.

602
00:46:00,843 --> 00:46:02,177
Come on.

603
00:46:02,553 --> 00:46:03,762
Okay.

604
00:46:04,263 --> 00:46:07,433
Okay. Activate... Activate undock.

605
00:46:35,586 --> 00:46:37,546
Seven minutes to get out of here.

606
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:46,318
All right, okay.

607
00:47:02,112 --> 00:47:03,113
What? What, what?

608
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:14,833
No, no, no!

609
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:46,281
Stop, stop, Stop!

610
00:48:03,257 --> 00:48:05,342
That's right, that's right.
Come on, come on.

611
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:08,285
That's right, that's right, that's right.

612
00:48:10,912 --> 00:48:11,496
Come on.

613
00:48:48,007 --> 00:48:48,924
Great.

614
00:49:35,182 --> 00:49:38,712
Clear skies with 
a chance of satellite debris.

615
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:55,721
Okay, we detach this and we go home.
Piece of cake.

616
00:51:21,551 --> 00:51:22,761
Okay.

617
00:51:26,897 --> 00:51:28,654
Okay, what do we have?

618
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:30,842
Okay, all right.

619
00:51:41,492 --> 00:51:42,488
Shit.

620
00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:52,235
Okay, come on.

621
00:51:52,486 --> 00:51:53,688
Come on, come on.

622
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:55,155
All right.

623
00:53:26,121 --> 00:53:27,873
I hate space.

624
00:53:47,851 --> 00:53:49,102
Shut up.

625
00:53:53,773 --> 00:53:54,941
Okay.

626
00:54:02,908 --> 00:54:04,367
All right.

627
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,081
That's good.

628
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:12,834
Okay.

629
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:16,338
Let's stabilize you.

630
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:32,729
Okay.

631
00:54:34,064 --> 00:54:36,816
Let's go visit the Chinese station.

632
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,235
Houston, in the blind...

633
00:54:39,488 --> 00:54:43,116
Tiangong is approximately
100 kilometers...

634
00:54:43,365 --> 00:54:45,283
...to the west...

635
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:50,624
...and I am off its course by 
about 13 degrees.

636
00:54:50,647 --> 00:54:52,941
I will correct trajectory.

637
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:16,306
Okay.

638
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,274
Okay.

639
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:20,151
Okay.

640
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:26,293
I will engage S-Ka-Dae 
in five, four, three,

641
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:27,598
two, one.

642
00:55:42,716 --> 00:55:45,260
What's happening, what's happening?
Come on, come on.

643
00:55:48,013 --> 00:55:48,680
One.

644
00:56:03,278 --> 00:56:04,571
Come on, come on, come on.

645
00:56:09,743 --> 00:56:11,536
You gotta be kidding me.

646
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:13,747
You gotta be kidding me!

647
00:56:18,585 --> 00:56:19,836
No! Don't you fu-

648
00:56:30,138 --> 00:56:31,973
Houston, in the blind.

649
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:35,060
Houston, in the blind, 
this is Dr. Ryan Stone.

650
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:39,314
I'm calling from the Soyuz TMA-14M.

651
00:56:39,689 --> 00:56:43,068
I'm currently out of fuel and adrift,
do you copy?

652
00:56:45,403 --> 00:56:51,493
Houston. This is Dr. Ryan Stone.
Do you copy?

653
00:56:55,413 --> 00:57:00,502
Houston. This is Ryan Stone.
Do you copy?

654
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:07,967
Houston, this is Mission... Mission
Specialist Ryan Stone. Do you copy?

655
00:57:10,209 --> 00:57:13,333
Houston. Houston, please confirm identity.

656
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:16,255
Houston, you're coming in
over an AM frequency. Copy.

657
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:19,896
Do you copy?

658
00:57:20,341 --> 00:57:23,636
Is this the Chinese station?
Is this Tiangong? Copy.

659
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:27,070
Mayday, can you copy?

660
00:57:27,095 --> 00:57:29,809
Mayday, mayday. Mayday.

661
00:57:30,198 --> 00:57:33,325
- Mayday.
- Yes, yes. Mayday, mayday.

662
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:35,731
- Mayday.
- Mayday, mayday.

663
00:57:36,746 --> 00:57:39,082
Aningaaq.

664
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,440
- Aningaaq, is that your name?
- Aningaaq.

665
00:57:44,465 --> 00:57:48,005
- Aningaaq is your name? Is that your name?
- Mayday. Aningaaq.

666
00:57:48,133 --> 00:57:50,385
Aningaaq. mayday...

667
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:55,342
No, no, no. No, my name is not mayday.
I'm Stone. Dr. Ryan Stone.

668
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,058
I need help. I am-

669
00:58:00,979 --> 00:58:02,522
Those are dogs.

670
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:05,208
They're calling from Earth.

671
00:58:08,653 --> 00:58:10,255
They're calling from Earth.

672
00:58:23,376 --> 00:58:24,794
Aningaaq...

673
00:58:25,685 --> 00:58:28,533
...make your dogs bark again for me,
would you, please?

674
00:58:30,335 --> 00:58:33,046
Your dogs. Dogs, you know.

675
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,526
Woof, woof. Dogs.

676
00:58:49,652 --> 00:58:50,945
Woof, woof.

677
00:59:19,182 --> 00:59:21,809
Oh, I'm gonna die, Aningaaq.

678
00:59:24,145 --> 00:59:27,357
I know, we're all gonna die.
Everybody knows that.

679
00:59:28,024 --> 00:59:30,360
But I'm gonna die today.

680
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:36,282
Funny, that. You know, to know...

681
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:42,526
But the thing is, 
it's that I'm still scared.

682
00:59:42,914 --> 00:59:44,337
I'm really scared.

683
00:59:47,326 --> 00:59:51,065
Nobody will mourn for me,
no one will pray for my soul.

684
00:59:54,139 --> 00:59:55,932
Will you mourn for me?

685
00:59:57,433 --> 00:59:59,435
Will you say a prayer for me?

686
01:00:00,027 --> 01:00:01,778
Or is it too late?

687
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:09,885
I mean, I'd say one for myself,
but I've never prayed in my life, so...

688
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:13,444
Nobody ever taught me how.

689
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:19,784
Nobody ever taught me how.

690
01:00:31,129 --> 01:00:32,547
A baby.

691
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:47,703
There's a baby with you, huh?

692
01:00:50,106 --> 01:00:52,273
Is that a lullaby you're singing?

693
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:56,750
That's so sweet.

694
01:00:59,324 --> 01:01:01,659
I used to sing to my baby.

695
01:01:05,308 --> 01:01:07,435
I hope I see her soon.

696
01:02:17,652 --> 01:02:20,984
That's nice, Aningaaq.
Keep singing, just like that.

697
01:02:22,746 --> 01:02:25,117
Sing me to sleep, and I'll sleep.

698
01:02:27,036 --> 01:02:30,672
Keep singing. And sing and sing.

699
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:02,445
No, no, no, don't!

700
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:48,242
Check your watch.
Thirteen hours and 11 minutes.

701
01:03:48,493 --> 01:03:51,109
Call Anatoly and tell him he's been bumped.

702
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:53,843
- It's a little gloomy in here, isn't it?
- How did you...

703
01:03:53,868 --> 01:03:56,663
- Trust me, it's a hell of a story.
- But how did you...

704
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:00,546
That's better.

705
01:04:01,422 --> 01:04:04,926
I found a little extra...
A little extra battery power.

706
01:04:05,176 --> 01:04:07,678
It helps that I didn't have you around
to distract me.

707
01:04:07,819 --> 01:04:12,156
I have to say, I'm glad to see you.
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

708
01:04:12,517 --> 01:04:13,935
Did you find the vodka?

709
01:04:15,436 --> 01:04:18,648
- You never told me where it was, so...
- Oh, well...

710
01:04:18,898 --> 01:04:20,441
Ah, ah!

711
01:04:24,237 --> 01:04:25,780
To Anatoly.

712
01:04:32,537 --> 01:04:35,289
Huh? No? All right.

713
01:04:36,332 --> 01:04:37,792
Let's get out of here.

714
01:04:39,585 --> 01:04:44,215
The Chinese station's about 100 miles.
Just a little Sunday drive.

715
01:04:44,465 --> 01:04:45,925
- We can't.
- Sure we can.

716
01:04:46,175 --> 01:04:49,887
- There's no fuel, I tried everything.
- Well, there's always something we can do.

717
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,336
I tried everything.

718
01:04:51,361 --> 01:04:53,187
Did you try the soft landing jets?

719
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:54,679
They're for landing, so...

720
01:04:54,704 --> 01:04:57,867
Landing is launching. It's the same.
Didn't you learn that in training?

721
01:04:57,892 --> 01:05:00,113
I never got to land the simulator, 
I told you.

722
01:05:00,138 --> 01:05:01,265
But you know about it.

723
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:04,752
- And I crashed it every time.
- Do you wanna go back or stay here?

724
01:05:08,197 --> 01:05:10,324
I get it, it's nice up here.

725
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:17,331
You can just shut down all the systems...

726
01:05:18,261 --> 01:05:20,055
...turn out all the lights...

727
01:05:21,002 --> 01:05:24,046
...and just close your eyes
and tune out everybody.

728
01:05:24,361 --> 01:05:26,322
There's nobody up here that can hurt you.

729
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,415
It's safe.

730
01:05:31,804 --> 01:05:34,734
I mean, what's the point of going on?
What's the point of living?

731
01:05:39,395 --> 01:05:43,107
Your kid died.
Doesn't get any rougher than that.

732
01:05:45,651 --> 01:05:47,984
But still, 
it's a matter of what you do now.

733
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:53,109
If you decide to go,
then you gotta just get on with it.

734
01:05:53,763 --> 01:05:56,062
Sit back, enjoy the ride.

735
01:05:56,871 --> 01:06:00,516
You gotta plant both your feet
on the ground and start living life.

736
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:02,001
How did you get here?

737
01:06:02,251 --> 01:06:04,462
I'm telling you, it's a hell of a story.

738
01:06:04,879 --> 01:06:06,213
Hey, Ryan?

739
01:06:06,432 --> 01:06:07,558
What?

740
01:06:08,007 --> 01:06:09,675
It's time to go home.

741
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,679
Landing...

742
01:06:57,056 --> 01:07:00,101
Landing... Landing is launching.

743
01:07:01,581 --> 01:07:02,874
I said...

744
01:07:16,701 --> 01:07:18,327
Okay, landing, landing.

745
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:20,324
Landing is green.

746
01:07:31,006 --> 01:07:32,133
Okay.

747
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:36,661
Okay, landing. All right.

748
01:07:37,763 --> 01:07:42,810
Okay. Soft landing jets trigger automatically
at 3 meters before landing, so...

749
01:07:45,688 --> 01:07:47,940
Oh, you're a clever son of a bitch, Matt.

750
01:07:48,151 --> 01:07:54,363
I need to... I need to get rid of
the Bay-O and the engine module.

751
01:07:55,614 --> 01:07:56,615
Right. Okay.

752
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:58,284
Okay.

753
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:01,996
Okay.

754
01:08:04,874 --> 01:08:06,500
Tri-module separation.

755
01:08:07,668 --> 01:08:08,122
Go.

756
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:24,769
Okay.

757
01:08:25,561 --> 01:08:27,897
Houston, here's the tricky part.

758
01:08:28,434 --> 01:08:33,839
Soyuz has to think
we are 3 meters off the Earth.

759
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:37,698
All right. Okay.

760
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,200
Hey, Matt?

761
01:08:39,828 --> 01:08:43,791
Since I had to listen to endless hours
of your storytelling this week,

762
01:08:43,812 --> 01:08:45,331
I need you to do me a favor.

763
01:08:46,861 --> 01:08:49,864
You are gonna see
a little girl with brown hair...

764
01:08:50,169 --> 01:08:52,760
...very messy, lots of knots.

765
01:08:53,064 --> 01:08:54,858
She doesn't like to brush it.

766
01:08:55,299 --> 01:08:56,759
That's okay.

767
01:08:57,337 --> 01:08:59,047
Her name is Sarah.

768
01:08:59,848 --> 01:09:04,978
Can you please tell her that
Mama found her red shoe?

769
01:09:05,572 --> 01:09:10,568
She was so worried about that shoe, Matt.
But it was just right under the bed.

770
01:09:14,944 --> 01:09:19,281
Give her a big hug and a big kiss for me 
and tell her that Mama misses her.

771
01:09:19,824 --> 01:09:22,409
You tell her that she is my angel.

772
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:26,121
And she makes me so proud. So, so proud.

773
01:09:31,311 --> 01:09:33,336
And you tell her that I'm not quitting.

774
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:42,972
You tell her that I love her, Matt.

775
01:09:43,889 --> 01:09:46,305
You tell her that I love her so much.

776
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:50,479
Can you do that for me?

777
01:09:53,232 --> 01:09:54,733
Roger that.

778
01:09:56,814 --> 01:09:58,273
Here we go.

779
01:10:34,916 --> 01:10:37,377
You're losing altitude, Tiangong.

780
01:10:40,325 --> 01:10:43,412
You keep dropping and 
you're gonna kiss the atmosphere.

781
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,991
But not without me
because you're my last ride.

782
01:10:50,956 --> 01:10:52,180
Wait.

783
01:10:59,548 --> 01:11:00,841
Five.

784
01:11:02,051 --> 01:11:03,260
Four.

785
01:11:04,386 --> 01:11:05,679
Three...

786
01:11:06,519 --> 01:11:08,354
No more just driving.

787
01:11:09,975 --> 01:11:11,477
Let's go home.

788
01:11:16,815 --> 01:11:19,360
Okay, come on.
Come on. Come on.

789
01:11:20,402 --> 01:11:21,656
Steady, steady.

790
01:11:22,404 --> 01:11:24,782
Come on. Come on. Agh!

791
01:11:28,702 --> 01:11:31,747
Where are you? Where are you?
Forty-five, 90, 180.

792
01:11:31,946 --> 01:11:33,123
One-eighty.

793
01:11:40,673 --> 01:11:41,799
Come on.

794
01:11:51,517 --> 01:11:52,685
Okay.

795
01:12:10,035 --> 01:12:11,623
Damn it. Agh!

796
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:40,748
Shit!

797
01:13:50,484 --> 01:13:52,014
Shenzhou, come on.

798
01:13:52,514 --> 01:13:53,967
Shenzhou.Shenzhou.

799
01:13:54,848 --> 01:13:55,808
Fuck!

800
01:13:56,058 --> 01:13:57,201
Okay, this way.

801
01:14:57,703 --> 01:14:59,913
In the Soyuz, the power button is...

802
01:15:00,151 --> 01:15:00,941
...here.

803
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,496
Okay, uh, undocking, undocking. Um...

804
01:15:07,754 --> 01:15:09,131
Uh, eenie, meenie...

805
01:15:10,382 --> 01:15:12,092
Okay, that doesn't sound good.

806
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:13,594
Minie...

807
01:15:14,229 --> 01:15:14,979
...mo.

808
01:15:19,683 --> 01:15:20,785
Minie...

809
01:15:21,084 --> 01:15:21,839
...mo.

810
01:15:23,437 --> 01:15:25,183
Okay. Okay, good.

811
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:36,491
Houston. Houston, in the blind.

812
01:15:36,742 --> 01:15:40,412
This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone
reporting from the Shenzhou.

813
01:15:40,568 --> 01:15:43,173
I'm about to undock from Tiangong.

814
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:45,626
Uh...

815
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:50,141
And I have a bad feeling about 
this mission.

816
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:54,587
Reminds me of a story, Houston.

817
01:15:57,179 --> 01:16:01,274
Never... Never mind the story, Houston.
Never mind the story.

818
01:16:03,602 --> 01:16:06,688
It's getting hot in here. Okay. All right.

819
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:08,735
Okay.

820
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:13,695
All right, the way I see it,
there's only two possible outcomes.

821
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:18,436
Either I make it down there in one piece,
and I have one hell of a story to tell...

822
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:21,055
...or I burn up in the next 10 minutes.

823
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,249
Either way, whichever way...

824
01:16:25,707 --> 01:16:27,712
...no harm, no foul!

825
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:36,635
Because either way...

826
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:41,223
...it'll be one hell of a ride.

827
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,837
I'm ready.

828
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:56,043
Shenzhou, in the blind, this is Houston. 
Indicate FM frequency.

829
01:18:57,696 --> 01:19:00,074
Our radars detect you on 
a reentry trajectory.

830
01:19:00,362 --> 01:19:02,697
If you copy, please confirm identity.

831
01:19:23,848 --> 01:19:24,970
This is Houston...

832
01:19:33,937 --> 01:19:35,414
Please confirm identity.

833
01:19:35,442 --> 01:19:37,485
Skies over the Midwest
are completely clear...

834
01:19:40,318 --> 01:19:42,535
Rescue mission is on the way.

835
01:19:46,283 --> 01:19:48,660
Shenzhou, in the blind, this is Houston.

836
01:19:50,829 --> 01:19:53,039
We've deployed a rescue mission...

837
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,043
Our radar...

838
01:22:44,711 --> 01:22:45,991
Thank you.

839
01:22:53,224 --> 01:22:54,559
No.

840
01:30:49,612 --> 01:30:52,054
Three, two...

841
01:30:52,489 --> 01:30:54,484
...one, mark.
