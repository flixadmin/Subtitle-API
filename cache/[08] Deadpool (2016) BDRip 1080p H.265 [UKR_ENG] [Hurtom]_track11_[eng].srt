1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,671
RYAN REYNOLDS: All right.

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:09,676
(LAUGHS) Welcome to the Deadpool
home entertainment commentary.

3
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,113
PAUL WERNICK: Has a nice ring to it.
REYNOLDS: Thank you.

4
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,430
Uh, this is Ryan Reynolds.

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,891
I'm here with Rhett Reese
and Paul Wernick.

6
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:16,975
WERNICK: Hello.

7
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:21,355
REYNOLDS: The screenwriters of
the Deadpool cinematic festival.

8
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:26,318
Just to set the tone, we're at my house.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,279
We're in the basement of my house.

10
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,366
WERNICK: Where we've been
for the last, uh, 14 months

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,700
you've had us locked down here?

12
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,428
REYNOLDS: Yes,
where I've had these guys, uh...

13
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:39,122
So, if you hear... We're in my house,
so If you hear dogs barking or something

14
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,250
or if you hear an elderly
door-to-door salesman

15
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:45,045
who sounds like he's
tied up with a ball gag

16
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,091
- and several other things...
- (WERNICK LAUGHS)

17
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,676
...just carry on.

18
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:55,055
It should also be known that we have
a life-size Deadpool in the room with us.

19
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:59,601
The suit that I stole while shooting
the film, I brought home with me

20
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:04,231
and is basically, sort of,
presiding over the commentary.

21
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,988
WERNICK: What year was
the Sexiest Man Alive, Ryan?

22
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,241
REYNOLDS: For me or Hugh Jackman?
WERNICK: You, you.

23
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,243
REYNOLDS: For me, it was 2010.

24
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,204
- For Hugh Jackman, 2008.
- WERNICK: Mmm.

25
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:22,332
- Both great years.
- REYNOLDS: And I saw Hugh the other day

26
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,875
and somebody made a joke about that

27
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,420
and we couldn't tell you
who the other guys were,

28
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,588
which is sort of ..

29
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,047
RHETT REESE: Oh, sure, sure.

30
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,818
REYNOLDS: (CHUCKLES) I'm kidding.
I've got all the issues right here.

31
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:32,884
(REESE LAUGHING)

32
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:37,347
REESE: Does anyone want to talk about
what inspired the credit scene here?

33
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:38,866
REYNOLDS: Yeah.
WERNICK: This was a, uh,

34
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:45,439
Philips Carousel advertisement
directed by, I think, Adam Berg?

35
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,983
REYNOLDS: Yup. Adam Berg.
Yeah, that's what inspired this.

36
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,861
This is six years old, basically.

37
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,130
This has been in the script forever.

38
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:56,158
This song was the first song
we had in the script as well, right?

39
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,784
WERNICK: It was.
REYNOLDS: Yup.

40
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,536
(MUSIC PLAYING)

41
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,372
Angel of the Morning by Juice Newton.

42
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,001
WERNICK: Which will introduce Juice
to a whole new generation

43
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,128
which we're most excited about.

44
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,839
REYNOLDS: It's true.

45
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,692
- That's very, very true.
- REESE: And this is, of course,

46
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,551
100% CGl.

47
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:21,058
Tim Miller originally wanted to do
the vast, vast majority of the movie

48
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,392
in a computer entirely.

49
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,477
Am I wrong?

50
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,372
REYNOLDS: He actually wanted to...
Because he'd never directed a film before,

51
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,983
he wanted to do a CGl version
of the entire movie first

52
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,820
before we set foot on this
and practically shot it,

53
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:38,075
which he soon realized
was totally ludicrous and impractical.

54
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,535
But a great idea.

55
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,579
Be nice if we could do that.

56
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,874
And our cab here.

57
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,269
But also that opening credit sequence

58
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,896
was in the movie
and then out of the movie,

59
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,314
then in the movie
and then out of the movie,

60
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,590
and thank God it stayed in, in the end.

61
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,342
"Cause we love it.

62
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,862
That's Tim Miller's gum, by the way.

63
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,681
That is the director's real gum
that was on the ceiling of the, uh...

64
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,600
- WERNICK: Is that right?
- ...cab. Yes. Yes, it was.

65
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,228
(GRUNTS) Yeah, little help.

66
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,357
Okay, um, just, I have to keep my hands...

67
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,442
WERNICK: As actors in that
opening credit sequence,

68
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,028
did you need to have waivers for that

69
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:18,573
in terms of not having your name
on the opening titles?

70
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,201
REYNOLDS: No, we didn't.

71
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,955
As long as you didn't use
anyone else's real name, it's fine.

72
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,707
Not the Daffodil Daydream. The girl.

73
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,252
- Ah, yes. Gita. She is quite lovely.
- Hmm.

74
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:34,339
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife.

75
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,568
REYNOLDS: Should I say
where the name Dopinder comes from?

76
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,635
WERNICK: Please, yes.

77
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,447
REYNOLDS: The name Dopinder is a guy
that I went to elementary school with,

78
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,600
who unfortunately died
being struck by lightning.

79
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,936
I'm not making that up.

80
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,288
Yeah, sir, you called for it, remember?

81
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,814
No, my slender brown friend.

82
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:55,819
REYNOLDS: And he was a buddy of mine,
and I, sort of, pay homage to him

83
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,363
by using his name here in the movie.

84
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:04,161
He's now immortalized by Karan Soni,
who plays our Dopinder.

85
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,121
- Got it?
- Yeah.

86
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:10,584
WERNICK: Karan actually, uh...
My daughter found Karan. (CHUCKLES)

87
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,627
Sir, what does Miss Mama June
taste like?

88
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:17,632
WERNICK: He was in the AT&T ads,
and she loves him

89
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,051
- and thought he was so funny.
- REYNOLDS: Hmm.

90
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,555
- She was the one who recommended...
- REYNOLDS: Really?

91
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,183
...him to me and then me
to the casting director

92
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,161
- and then he came in. Yup.
- REYNOLDS: Ah, I didn't know that.

93
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,519
God, he was such a find.

94
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,230
- He was so, so great. Yeah.
- WERNICK: So great.

95
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,233
REESE: Dopinder is talking
about the red suit here.

96
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,277
Should we talk a little bit about the suit

97
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,738
and your reaction to
the first time you saw it?

98
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,448
REYNOLDS: Yeah, that's, um...

99
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,574
Oh, God.

100
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,660
The suit made me weep
the first time I saw it.

101
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,412
In fact it was, uh...

102
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,849
REESE: And subsequently made you weep
every time you had to put it on.

103
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:50,874
REYNOLDS: That's true.

104
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,018
At the beginning of the film,

105
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,186
it took about 40 minutes to put it on,

106
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,462
and by the end, I had that down to 10.

107
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,633
But it is a work of
art, that suit. It truly is.

108
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,344
Russ Shankle at Film illusions created it.

109
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,888
I think it's the most faithful

110
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,974
comic-book-to-screen adaptation
of a super suit ever.

111
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,285
REESE: Absolutely.
REYNOLDS: I love it.

112
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,019
REESE: It's just awesome.
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

113
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,911
WERNICK: How many suits
were there, Ryan?

114
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,356
REYNOLDS: There were nine suits.

115
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,943
We destroyed seven of them
shooting the film.

116
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,156
And one of the two remaining suits
I left with at the end of filming.

117
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,701
That's the one that is presiding
over our commentary right now.

118
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,161
I just walked off set with it

119
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,330
and basically told them
to go fuck themselves.

120
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,891
<i>- WERNICK: Yeah.
- I waited 10 years to do the movie...</i>

121
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:32,958
REESE: Broke a few laws.

122
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,918
REYNOLDS: If they want to
take the suit back,

123
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,521
they can come try and take it from me.

124
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,839
I was in very good shape
when I shot the Deadpool movie

125
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:43,552
and I felt confident that I could take out
a 107-pound studio executive.

126
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,238
REESE: And contrary
to what you might think,

127
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,556
you could see out of it pretty well,

128
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,560
and we could also hear you talking
without it seeming too muffled.

129
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,644
It was a pretty...

130
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,081
REYNOLDS: I do feel like we had some
dumb luck with the suit there.

131
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,648
We really got lucky.

132
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,526
You can hear Deadpool very well
and I could see very well.

133
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,609
REESE: Yeah.

134
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:03,196
REYNOLDS: We had
two different sets of eyes.

135
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,198
We had the stunt eyes for the suit,

136
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,075
which the black part was sort of a mesh.

137
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,451
I could see through it.

138
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,913
And then for close-ups,
I used an opaque eye mask.

139
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,164
So that's an opaque one.

140
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:17,085
You can't... Just the white part
was the only piece I could see through.

141
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,753
WERNICK: And the eyes pop out, right?

142
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,297
REYNOLDS: Yeah, they're magnetic.

143
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,507
They actually clip on with magnets.

144
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,971
REESE: And if you're wondering why
Deadpool seems so expressive in the suit,

145
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,557
a part of that is Ryan's genius physicality

146
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,535
- in acting within the suit.
- REYNOLDS: Thank you.

147
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:37,355
REESE: But it's also the fact that
they did some facial motion capture.

148
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:42,611
And they actually used CG
to animate the face in specific scenes

149
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,529
so that Deadpool can make expressions,

150
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,782
like his eyes open right there,
for instance, just a little bit.

151
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,452
That's actually done in a computer

152
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,580
because the suit itself
is not that expressive.

153
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,664
WERNICK: Hmm.

154
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,459
(REYNOLDS LAUGHS)

155
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,755
WERNICK: Ryan's Australian accent.

156
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,983
REYNOLDS: (IN ACCENT) Do you like it?
WERNICK: Absolute favorite.

157
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,151
REYNOLDS: Like to have a good time

158
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,652
- with my Aussie accent.
- (WERNICK AND REESE LAUGHING)

159
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,971
REYNOLDS: Just get right in there
and do a little Hugh Jackman.

160
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,933
- (REYNOLDS CHUCKLING)
- WERNICK: This was originally

161
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,143
uh, conceived in a computer

162
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,395
as test footage we did.

163
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,832
REYNOLDS: (IN NORMAL VOICE)
This is part of the infamous test footage.

164
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:20,982
WERNICK: That leaked online.

165
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:24,611
We did it I think, what, 2011
we did the test for Fox?

166
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,779
REYNOLDS: Yup.
REESE: Yeah.

167
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,530
Tim Miller was...

168
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,616
I believe he got what, $300,000?

169
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,760
- Something like that?
- WERNICK: Something...

170
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,995
REYNOLDS: (STAMMERS) $275,000.
REESE: $275,000 to prove to the studio

171
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,830
that he could handle the movie,

172
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,041
and he did this wonderful test.

173
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,586
It was so wonderful,
but the public never saw it, so...

174
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,047
We started all hatching a plot.

175
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,341
We were having difficulties
getting the movie green lit.

176
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,094
We started hatching a plot
to leak the footage.

177
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,721
REYNOLDS: (STUTTERS)
Are you... You're, um...

178
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,157
REESE: And when I say "hatching a plot,"

179
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,475
none of us was
technologically savvy enough

180
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,703
- to actually leak it.
- REYNOLDS: To figure out how to do that.

181
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,206
REESE: Each of us was trying to
convince the others to do it for him.

182
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,084
REYNOLDS: I think that's what's...
That's the story we're telling each other,

183
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,943
but I think one of us...

184
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,004
- I believe that one of us did it.
- WERNICK: Ryan Reynolds.

185
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,048
REYNOLDS: One of us leaked that footage.
WERNICK: Ryan Reynolds.

186
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,242
- His name rhymes with Bryan Breynolds.
- (REESE LAUGHS)

187
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,970
REYNOLDS: "Bryan Breynolds".
REESE: I mean, it's a...

188
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,314
It's kind of like a game of Clue.

189
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,122
There are only about six or seven suspects,

190
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,642
So you know, somebody was in
the dining room with the candle stick.

191
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,042
REYNOLDS: Absolutely.

192
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,129
And that...

193
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,065
WERNICK: Which probably
is worth talking about...

194
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,089
REYNOLDS: That was fun.

195
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,677
WERNICK: Kind of the evolution of the
long process of getting this movie made

196
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:36,516
because, again, we're talking now 2011,
which was five years ago.

197
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,618
REYNOLDS: Yeah.
WERNICK: Um...

198
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:41,312
And the movie, Ryan,
has been in development, what...

199
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:45,525
You were first brought the comics,
what, in...

200
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,777
REYNOLDS: I was...
WERNICK: 2003?

201
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,029
REYNOLDS: 2004.
WERNICK: 2004.

202
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,715
REYNOLDS: I've been involved
with Deadpool,

203
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:54,325
or attached to some aspect
of Deadpool development

204
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:58,288
for, uh, 11 years
before actually making the movie, so...

205
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,599
WERNICK: And it came to you when?
When you were doing Blade, right?

206
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,293
<i>REYNOLDS: It came to me
when I was doing Blade: Trinity.</i>

207
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,422
Say what you will about that movie,
but it brought me great things.

208
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,007
It actually was a lot of fun.

209
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,052
I got to improvise a lot and goof around.

210
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,472
Uh, looking back at it, you know,
I look back at it and I think,

211
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,767
"I was kind of, in a weird way,
playing Wade Wilson in that movie

212
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,934
"and I didn't know it."

213
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,061
Someone else did, though.

214
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,355
That's who sent me the comic book...
The stack of comics.

215
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,816
I was sent them and a guy...

216
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,276
And he said, "You're Deadpool."

217
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,399
I said, "Who's Deadpool?""

218
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,166
And he said,
"You should read these comics.

219
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,531
"If they ever make a Deadpool movie,
you're the guy."

220
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,493
And I read them and I fell in love with it.

221
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,622
That was in 2004 when that panel came out
on the Deadpool comic

222
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,750
that said... Asking what Deadpool,
what he looks like.

223
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,378
And he said, "I'm a cross between
Ryan Reynolds and a shar-pei."

224
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,173
- (REESE LAUGHS)
- That was sort of kismet I thought, so...

225
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,299
Please.

226
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,010
WERNICK: And then it moved over to Fox.

227
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,929
You ate breakfast, yes?

228
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,073
WERNICK: Correct?
REYNOLDS: Yes.

229
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,365
WERNICK: 'Cause it was
at New Line, was it not?

230
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,659
REYNOLDS: I think it was at New Line,
was where it was at initially.

231
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,060
Avi Arad had it, actually.

232
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,188
No, I don't know if it was actually
at a studio home.

233
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:09,275
Avi Arad owned Marvel at the time and...

234
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,779
A little startup called Marvel
that seemed to do all right.

235
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,032
Uh, and then, yeah,
eventually it was at Fox

236
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,119
with all the other X-Men properties,
So, yeah.

237
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:23,206
WERNICK: And we wrote the script in 2009.
REYNOLDS: Yup.

238
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,710
WERNICK: And a draft of the script
in every calendar year since.

239
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,797
REYNOLDS: (LAUGHS) Yeah. Right. Yeah.
WERNICK: Truly.

240
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,900
- 2009 to 2016...
- REYNOLDS: But the script has largely...

241
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,843
The storylines
have largely stayed the same.

242
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:38,721
WERNICK: Interestingly, if you go back
and read our first draft of the script

243
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,267
and then you watch the movie,
it's not that different.

244
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,452
- I mean...
- REYNOLDS: Just more expensive.

245
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,894
WERNICK: A lot more expensive.

246
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,063
REYNOLDS: Yeah, the old version
was loo expensive.

247
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,357
WERNICK: At one point,
we had a PG-13 version.

248
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,900
Fox commissioned us

249
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,545
- to write a PG-13 version...
- REYNOLDS: Yeah.

250
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,404
<i>- It was six pages long.
- (WERNICK LAUGHS)</i>

251
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:58,658
REESE: The character of Angel Dust,
played by Gina Carano,

252
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,493
was actually three different characters.

253
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,413
It was Garrison Kane, Wyre and Sluggo.

254
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,182
REYNOLDS: Yeah.
REESE: If you remember that.

255
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,207
REYNOLDS: Sluggo, yeah.

256
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,169
REESE: For budget reasons,
we did away with two

257
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,692
and changed the third to Angel Dust.

258
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,838
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

259
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:17,177
REESE: We ended up adding
Negasonic Teenage Warhead much later.

260
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,678
REYNOLDS: True.

261
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,181
REESE: She was
not in the original draft.

262
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,266
But Colossus was always there.

263
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,519
REYNOLDS: This entire sequence
is shot on a viaduct

264
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,688
in Vancouver, British Columbia,
where I grew up.

265
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,523
This is my hometown.

266
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,610
And I became
public enemy number one, uh,

267
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,197
because we cocked up the traffic
in Vancouver for two and a half weeks

268
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,282
while we took over this bridge.

269
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:43,411
Uh, somehow, I got thrown under the bus
with that. (CHUCKLES)

270
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:47,540
All the media in Vancouver
was blaming me for the issues,

271
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,918
which I guess, to some degree,
it is my fault.

272
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,211
WERNICK: Kind of your fault.

273
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:55,173
REYNOLDS: I do apologize to the citizens
of Vancouver, British Columbia.

274
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,844
WERNICK: We shot
the entire movie in Vancouver.

275
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:00,988
REYNOLDS: Yeah, it was great.

276
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,640
Good city to shoot in. Great crews.

277
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,519
REESE: I think we feel that
whenever you're writing an action scene,

278
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,521
you want to stack the odds
against your hero.

279
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,233
REYNOLDS: That guy right there
who I just shot in the head,

280
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,652
he was my double in Blade.

281
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,379
- He was my stunt double.
- REESE: Oh, is that right?

282
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,839
REYNOLDS: That was my main
stunt double in Blade.

283
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,073
REESE: Wow.
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

284
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,241
Yeah.

285
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,969
REESE: But yeah, we always like to
stack the odds against the hero,

286
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,662
and we did it in this scene

287
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:30,375
by reducing Deadpool's ammunition supply
to only 12 bullets.

288
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,085
And we just put him in a predicament.

289
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,253
How do you use 12 bullets

290
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,176
- to kill a bunch of guys?
- REYNOLDS: Mmm-hmm.

291
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:40,468
WERNICK: It's the only sequence
Deadpool shoots a gun.

292
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,678
Is that correct?

293
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,096
REYNOLDS: Pretty much. Yeah.

294
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,990
WERNICK: Otherwise it's katanas.
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

295
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,243
REYNOLDS: Well, other...
Right at the very end of the film...

296
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,327
WERNICK: Oh, yes.
REYNOLDS: One bullet.

297
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,852
WERNICK: One bullet. Spoiler alert.

298
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,288
REYNOLDS: But, um,
we do love the katanas.

299
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,981
I got shot in the asshole there,

300
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:56,943
which right up until a week
before shooting that sequence,

301
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,778
it was in the face.

302
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,631
WERNICK: Yeah.
REYNOLDS: And then we changed it.

303
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,495
We just thought asshole would be
a lot funnier.

304
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,010
WERNICK: Ryan had the idea
that getting shot in the ass was so funny

305
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,160
and it gets a huge laugh.

306
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,831
REYNOLDS: I was trying to find some way
to work in "Right up Main Street.""

307
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,914
- WERNICK: Such a great line.
- (REYNOLDS CHUCKLES)

308
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,585
Oh, yeah.

309
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,798
WERNICK: He shoots one gun there

310
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:20,842
and both are smoking.

311
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,685
REYNOLDS: We have both barrels
smoking, so...

312
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,763
'Cause we're complete asswipes.

313
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,724
Where you at, Francis?

314
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,226
REYNOLDS: Oh, yeah.

315
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,145
That's Glenn.

316
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,563
He's about to get it.

317
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,065
He's about to get what he deserves.

318
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:40,194
WERNICK: You do training
with the katanas, Ryan, beforehand?

319
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,279
I can't remember.

320
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,282
I know you did it going into
the Wolverine movie.

321
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,967
REYNOLDS: I did...
WERNICK: Did you do it on this one?

322
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,927
REYNOLDS: I did a lot of it
on Wolverine and then |I...

323
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,554
There's only so much you can do
with katanas

324
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,497
There's only so much you can do
with katanas

325
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,915
and this is one of them,

326
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,168
which is spinning them around like that.

327
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,003
But, yeah, I like doing it.

328
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,254
I like the katana stuff.

329
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,065
WERNICK: And you have some katanas
in the house

330
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,174
from Wolverine, don't you?

331
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,402
- Didn't you take the katanas?
- REYNOLDS: I did take the katanas.

332
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:04,927
WERNICK: You steal everything.

333
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,364
- You're a little bit of a kleptomaniac.
- REESE: Yeah, I was gonna say.

334
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,431
You're a serial...

335
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,851
REYNOLDS: In a fitting piece of destiny,
those were stolen from me.

336
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,370
WERNICK: Were they?
REYNOLDS: I moved and, yeah,

337
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,634
somebody stole the Wolverine...

338
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,540
-(CLICKS TONGUE) ...katanas
-WERNICK: That's a huge bummer.

339
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,648
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

340
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,235
But, right next to you
are actually a pair of katanas

341
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,255
that are stolen from...
On the Deadpool, right there.

342
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,697
WERNICK: Oh, okay.
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

343
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,742
Oh, those jeans.

344
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,826
WERNICK: Great.

345
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,746
REESE: That was our ass-to-ass transition.
REYNOLDS: Yup.

346
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,457
REESE: A nod to Requiem for a Dream.

347
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,292
(REYNOLDS LAUGHING)

348
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,212
REYNOLDS: A nod to Fellini.

349
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,005
WADE: I did!

350
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,319
REYNOLDS: It always bugged me
that I flushed the toilet

351
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,763
after telling him I just took a shit
in his kitty litter box.

352
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,306
- WERNICK: Yeah.
- (REYNOLDS LAUGHS)

353
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,475
Is it burnt crust?

354
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,478
WERNICK: That is Bea Arthur on the shirt.

355
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,646
REYNOLDS: Yup.

356
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,731
That cost 10 grand.

357
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,292
- I don't mind saying.
- WERNICK: Is that right?

358
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,316
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

359
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,360
REESE: Oh, is that right?

360
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,504
WERNICK: Who did we
have to license that from?

361
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,089
Is that Bea Arthur's estate
or is that Golden Girls?

362
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,215
REYNOLDS: That is exactly it.

363
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,341
It was the Bea Arthur's estate.

364
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,367
It was a donation to one of her charities,

365
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,953
which I think was wonderful
and totally worthwhile doing.

366
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,206
But as a producer,
I had to approve a $10,000...

367
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,250
Which was just stupid at the time

368
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,773
because we were so desperate
to keep every penny on the screen

369
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,801
and our movie
did not have a big budget at all.

370
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,842
But you can't have a Deadpool movie
without Bea Arthur appearing,

371
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,760
so I felt like it was worth it.

372
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,741
WERNICK: Oh, for sure.
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

373
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,752
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kinda give it to me.

374
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,493
Okay, just look, man,
can I have my Sam's card...

375
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,018
I will shoot your fucking cat!

376
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:40,440
REESE: Those sunglasses
that, uh, Gavin's wearing right there

377
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,191
end up on your face in the next scene,

378
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,794
and I think very few people
make that connection.

379
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,170
REYNOLDS: I don't
think anybody... I know...

380
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,489
And I always cringe as I'm coming down
the stairs wearing them in the next scene

381
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,827
because I worry that people think
I just made a fashion choice

382
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,495
by selecting those glasses.

383
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,205
Getting that right? Orflosky?

384
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,373
REYNOLDS: "Orflosky?"

385
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,500
WERNICK: The, uh, pizza box

386
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,170
<i>- is, uh, Feige's famous...
- (REYNOLDS LAUGHS)</i>

387
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,733
- Kevin Feige?
- WERNICK: Kevin Feige.

388
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,008
A little Easter egg to the head of Marvel.

389
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,798
- The genius behind Marvel.
- REYNOLDS: That's true.

390
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,390
REESE: But it does bear mentioning,
this is not a Marvel Studio movie.

391
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,475
This is a Fox movie.

392
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,370
And a lot of people make that mistake
or make that assumption that this is...

393
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,038
REYNOLDS: I'm always shocked
how many people in the media

394
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,231
make that mistake, too.
You get a lot of that, too.

395
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,524
Yes, sir.

396
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:24,609
Then we're done.

397
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:29,238
- And the media's never wrong, So...
- (REESE LAUGHS)

398
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,781
You should've seen your face.

399
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,050
I didn't know what to do.
I was so scared.

400
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,744
REYNOLDS: That guy was great.
That guy was fantastic.

401
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,079
You even look
in her general direction again...

402
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,917
and you will learn in the worst of ways
that I have some hard spots too.

00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,086
(REESE LAUGHING)

404
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,689
REYNOLDS: He had no idea
I was gonna kiss him here

405
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,965
and he reacted perfectly, I was very happy.

406
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,819
- Oh, there you go.
- (REYNOLDS AND REESE CHUCKLING)

407
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,554
WERNICK: This was the final scene we shot
of the movie...

408
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:54,990
REYNOLDS: Of the whole film, yeah.
WERNICK: Yeah.

409
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,015
It was, uh...

410
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,285
REYNOLDS: And we said
it would never see the light of day.

411
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,661
- And here it is.
- WERNICK: And here we are.

412
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,686
Meghan?

413
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,898
REYNOLDS: Mostly 'cause of those glasses
that nobody realizes are from...

414
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,043
REESE.: I love your expression
when you look at them, though.

415
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,127
Here, as you take them off.

416
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,488
REYNOLDS: Oh, it's so...
Thank God we found that take because, uh...

417
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,324
Ew! Yeah, there you go.

418
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,617

Rollerblades for whatever reason
have always made me laugh.

WERNICK: Always. That was a Ryan ad-lib.

422
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,462
Ryan is just a genius ad-libber, um,

423
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,773

No-no-no-no. That I ain't!

all had a lot of fun writing alts, though.

00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,556
Like that was our favorite pastime

that was, um...

433
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,989
What bar in Vancouver was that, Ryan?
That was a...

434
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,550
REYNOLDS: That was
The Cobalt bar in Vancouver.

435
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,575
WERNICK: The Cobalt.

436
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,618
REYNOLDS: A bar, when I was a kid,
you would never go within 3,000 feet of.

437
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,496
And now is just like hipster central.

438
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,665
WERNICK: Is it? Because it felt like

439
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,935
- you still wouldn't go within 3,000 feet.
- (REYNOLDS LAUGHING)

440
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,002
Yeah, it has its night.

441
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,125
A specific night
where it's sort of hipster central,

442
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,089
but, yeah, otherwise
it's generally kind of...

443
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,924
Make sure that gets back to Ms...

444
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,094
REESE: I wouldn't go within 3,000 feet
of hipster central, to be honest.

445
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,238
REYNOLDS: Well, that's true, yeah.

446
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,156
You know, for a merc,
you're pretty warm-blooded.

447
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,640
I bet you let the kid off easy, too.

448
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,768
REESE: T.J. Miller. Force of nature.
REYNOLDS: Love T.J. Miller.

449
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,038
I was way worse than him
when I was his age.

450
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,856
I was traveling to exotic places...

451
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,501
REYNOLDS: T.J. Miller is
one of those guys that can...

452
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,111
He can't not improvise. Like, you can't...

453
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:36,282
It's like a fish in water.
He just has to fuck around.

454
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,491
And it's great.

455
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:41,287
And at least this is the kind of film where
we leave a lot of room to do that so...

456
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:43,581
WEASEL.: ...whipped cream.

457
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,833
I give you a Blow Job.

458
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,585
Why do you make me make that?

459
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,420
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

460
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,982
Take that over to Buck, please,
and tell him it's from Boothe.

461
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,007
Little foreplay.

462
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,217
Remind me what good will come of this?

463
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,345
I don't take the shits.
I just disturb them.

464
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,804
- BUCK: Boothe!
- Oh!

465
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,032
- Easy, man.
- Hold up! Hold up!

466
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,057
What you want?

467
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,392
- (GRUNTS)
- (ALL EXCLAIMING)

468
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,228
- Cheers. To your health.
- WEASEL: Fuck you.

469
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,731
BOOTHE: Come here, you fat fuck!

470
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,399
That's a new stool.

471
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,817
(ALL CLAMORING)

472
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,739
BUCK: Stay the fuck down.

473
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:17,865
(GROANS)

474
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,951
MAN: Whoa! Took his ass out!

475
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,912
WEASEL.: All right, move.
Move, move, move.

476
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,121
Buck, go rest.

477
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,516
REESE: Now, originally we had...

478
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,001
You had bet on Alex Trebek
in the dead pool right?

479
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,521
- That was who you decided...
- REYNOLDS: I bet on Alex Trebek.

480
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:35,341
Uh, I said it because Alejandro's
favorite color is cocaine.

481
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,301
Nobody wins today.

482
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,969
Nice try, Wade.

483
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,598
You got me. I picked Boothe
in the dead pool. Who did you pick?

484
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,767
Yeah, Wade, about that, um...

485
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,102
No.

486
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,270
You did not bet on me to die.

487
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,649
You bet on me to die.

488
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,536
REYNOLDS: Is anybody dead on
the dead pool, now? That would be awful.

489
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,630
REESE: That would be awful.
REYNOLDS: I hope that's not the case.

490
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,131
WERNICK: No, I don't think it is the case.

491
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,491
But who's up on that board? It's...

492
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,011
REYNOLDS: You got everybody up there.
WERNICK: There's some great ones.

493
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,746
REYNOLDS: Bill Cosby, you got Tim Miller.

494
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,456
(CHUCKLES) You got me.

495
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,749
WERNICK: Yeah, Ryan Reynolds.

496
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,473
REYNOLDS: Yeah, Ryan Reynolds
is up there.

497
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:11,794
There's a shit ton of...

498
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:13,772
WERNICK: Justin Bieber's up there.
REYNOLDS: Great ones.

499
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,024
- Justin Bieber wasn't initially one of the...
- WERNICK: Oh, yes.

500
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,466
...names I had on the dead pool,

501
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,510
or one of the guys I had picked
for the dead pool.

502
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,304
Uh... Tight.

503
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,766
- Vanessa.
- Wade.

504
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,186
WERNICK: When we were frying
to get the movie made,

505
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:34,984
we were doing everything and anything,
and actually there was a computer program

506
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,904
that you could, uh...
It was like an animated computer program,

507
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,907
where the voice
was a computer-generated voice

508
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,909
and you could punch in dialogue

509
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:49,749
and the computer would spit out the voice
matched to the animated characters.

510
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:50,833
REYNOLDS: I loved that.

511
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,145
WERNICK: And we made one...
REYNOLDS: Is that available somewhere?

512
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,756
WERNICK: I tried to pull it back up
and I couldn't. They had gotten rid of it.

513
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,108
<i>REYNOLDS: Damn.
WERNICK: It didn't exist anymore.</i>

514
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,860
REESE: We made one
for this particular scene.

515
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:00,926
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

516
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,512
I always loved this...

517
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,806
This is just you guys being geniuses.

518
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,518
I love this dialogue here,
between the both of us.

519
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,520
I was molested.

520
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,938
Me too. Uncle.

521
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,382
REYNOLDS: Morena was such a sport.

522
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,486
She loves working blue.

523
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,945
Which also happens to be my...

524
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,030
Your bedroom. Lucky.

525
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,962
REYNOLDS: She has
a wonderful potty mouth.

526
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,034
You had a dishwasher.

527
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,535
I didn't even know sleep.

528
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,997
It was pretty much 24/7 ball gags,
brownie mix and clown porn.

529
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:31,332
(LAUGHS)

530
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:36,295
REESE: Boy, I'm just afraid of that word,
"clown porn," that just sounds terrifying.

531
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:37,606
REYNOLDS: Clown porn?
REESE: Yeah.

532
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,524
REYNOLDS: You'd be shocked.
It's actually not bad.

533
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,549
(REESE LAUGHS)

534
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:48,057
WERNICK: Did they shave a little notch
into your eyebrow, Ryan?

535
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,934
REYNOLDS: You only
realized that just now?

536
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,435
WERNICK: I just now realized that.

537
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,830
REYNOLDS: Of course, there's scars
all over my head and my face.

538
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,981
And we wanted to give Wade a kind of look

539
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,484
of as though he had
sort of a history of violence.

540
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,486
And so there's scars all over.

541
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,380
You could see the side of my head,
there's one.

542
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,948
One that runs through my eyebrow.

543
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,123
And that's all the great Bill Corso,
who's just a genius makeup artist,

544
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:10,496
who also did our scarring effect
on Deadpool's face.

545
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,848
- He's, uh...
- WERNICK: Oh, he's brilliant.

546
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,583
REYNOLDS: He did Foxcatcher
and a few other movies that are just...

547
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,920
Lemony Snicket's. Incredible makeup work.

548
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:24,218
WERNICK: Tireless, too. On set
at the crack of dawn all the way through.

549
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,805
REYNOLDS: Yeah, just a great attitude.
Great work.

550
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,243
REESE: The skee ball scene
was not in the original script

551
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,854
and it was added to give a little bit more
of a sense of connection

552
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,188
and romantic development

553
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,624
- between these two characters...
- REYNOLDS: Mmm-hmm.

554
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:41,110
...so that their relationship wasn't
too based just on sex.

555
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:47,032
And I think it captures Wade's
kind of immature childish spirit.

556
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:50,119
I think one of the most important
characteristics of Deadpool

557
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,704
<i>is his childish nature.</i>

558
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,582
REYNOLDS: Yeah, he really
sort of represents

559
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,293
a huge part of the population
that are adult geeks.

560
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,295
I love that. I love that about him.

561
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,131
He worships the Voltron Ring.

562
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,675
WERNICK: My children were in this scene

563
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,678
and ended up
on the cutting room floor, actually.

564
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,405
REYNOLDS: Where they belong.
WERNICK: Where they belong.

565
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,222
- (LAUGHS)
- REYNOLDS: Where they belong.

566
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,825
REESE.: If their performances
had been better...

567
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,577
REYNOLDS: No nepotism
on this film, I'm sorry.

568
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:14,727
(REESE CHUCKLES)

569
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,479
WERNICK: Voltron, uh...

570
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,817
Rhett, talk about the Voltron thing because
that was a little bit of a late add.

571
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,446
REESE: Well, I think, again,
it was just getting at that nerd...

572
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,824
<i>Okay, we gotta stop talking about Voltron
and start talking about this.</i>

573
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:34,914
Because this was probably the toughest
particular sequence in the movie.

574
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:39,084
REYNOLDS: How is it that we spent
more time on this fucking sequence

575
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,921
than any other sequence in the film,
I think?

576
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:47,593
REESE: It was just so difficult to
choreograph and design jokes around and...

577
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,303
WERNICK: Get the right tone.

578
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,512
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

579
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,682
International Women's Day coming up.

580
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,601
That's one of our favorites.

581
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,353
<i>WERNICK: Which is, what,
March 8th, Rhett?</i>

582
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,622
REYNOLDS: March 8th,
International Women's Day.

583
00:23:58,646 --> 00:23:59,647
WERNICK: March 8th, yeah.

584
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,776
REYNOLDS: Also my brother's birthday
and Alanis Morissette Day.

585
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:04,860
WERNICK: Mmm.

586
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,923
- (CHUCKLES) All March 8th?
- REYNOLDS: Yeah.

587
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,007
- I know.
- WERNICK: Is that right?

588
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,074
REYNOLDS: I know my, uh...

589
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,343
WERNICK: You know your March 8th's.

590
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,762
REYNOLDS: We know our holidays now,
after this fucking movie.

591
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,747
We actually had an alt here,
which was Happy Alanis Morissette Day,

592
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,830
but we didn't use it.

593
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:18,874
- Wade?
- Sorry.

594
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,806
REESE: We had to line up all the holidays

595
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:24,630
So that they occurred in the correct
chronological order around the year,

596
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,714
which was difficult.

597
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:30,570
REYNOLDS: We could have just shot a scene
where two people fuck for five minutes

598
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,429
that might have been easier.

599
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:33,555
WERNICK: Surely easier.

600
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:36,725
REYNOLDS: But we do love our
Deadpool audience, so...

601
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,022
If your left leg is Thanksgiving...

602
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,857
and your right leg is Christmas...

603
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,487
REYNOLDS: Angus Strathie was
our costume designer,

604
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,907
who found all these horrific sweaters.

605
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,993
Red's your color.

606
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,679
REYNOLDS: This is just
the worst one I chose.

607
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,705
You can imagine what was available.

608
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,248
Really?

609
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,625
...about why we're so good together.

610
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,085
Why's that?

611
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,631
Well, your crazy matches my crazy.
Big time.

612
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,758
Hmm. (CHUCKLES)

613
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,763
And, uh, we're like two jigsaw pieces,
you know, the weird curvy edges...

614
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,556
You put them together
and you can see the picture on top.

615
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,433
Right.

616
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,101
Wade...

617
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,271
there's something I've been
meaning to ask you.

618
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,940
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.

619
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,110
Will you, um...

620
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,529
- stick it in my...
- Marry me?

621
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,905
(REYNOLDS CHUCKLES)

622
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:38,537
WERNICK: My brother actually
proposed to his wife with a ring pop.

623
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,723
REYNOLDS: (LAUGHS)
With a ring pop, really?

624
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:40,747
WERNICK: Yeah.

625
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,100
REESE: Is that true?
WERNICK: Yes.

626
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,435
REYNOLDS: Was it hiding up
his asshole, as well?

627
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,395
WERNICK: (LAUGHS) I will have to ask him.
REYNOLDS: Was he...

628
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,795
<i>Please do, I would love to...</i>

629
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,299
I love you, Wade Wilson.

630
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,485
You're supposed to...
So that's a...

631
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,552
- Yes!
- Whoo!

632
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,636
REYNOLDS: There we go.

633
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:55,804
Yes!

634
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:57,473
REYNOLDS: There we go.

635
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,433
I feel just like a little girl.

636
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,268
- (CHUCKLES)
- (SIGHS)

637
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,982
What if I just held on and never let go?

638
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,693
Just ride a bitch's back,
like Yoda on Luke.

639
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,196
Oh, Star Wars jokes.

640
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,864
Empire.

641
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,992
Jesus Christ.
It's like I...

642
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:21,955
WERNICK: Interestingly, this movie
is many things and...

643
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:29,630
The beating heart of it is the love story
between these two characters.

644
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,067
REYNOLDS: Yeah, we kind of made a joke
about that in the marketing,

645
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,677
but it really, actually is sort of true.
It does kind of anchor everything.

646
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:39,014
You know, it's what fuels
the revenge story in the film.

647
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,850
WERNICK: It is a fucked-up
romantic comedy.

648
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:47,397
Again, it's many things,
but that is one thing it is.

649
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,607
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

650
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,858
God bless it, though.

651
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,111
WERNICK: Oh, look at that. Look at that.

652
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,713
That's years of hard work right there...

653
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:54,923
- (REYNOLDS LAUGHS)
- ...In the gym.

654
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,448
REESE: And a lot of salmon.

655
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,660
REYNOLDS: Yeah, there's a lot of salmon
I ate for this movie.

656
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,513
- And steamed vegetables.
- REESE: Whole rivers.

657
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,205
Rivers full of salmon.

658
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,682
REYNOLDS: Oh, I just single-handedly

659
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,684
- depleted the world's salmon supply.
- (REESE CHUCKLES)

660
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,043
You're not clowning?

661
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,294
I sense clowns.

662
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:13,048
WERNICK: This was the first scene
we shot of the movie.

663
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,527
REYNOLDS: Oh, my God. You're right.
WERNICK: Day one.

664
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:18,929
REYNOLDS: I always think it's Blind Al,
but this was... No, this was day minus one.

665
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,306
- This was an off-the-record day.
- WERNICK: Yeah.

666
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,077
REYNOLDS: We shot this in pre-production
Just because we... The movie...

667
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:29,773
We had basically $50
to make a $500 movie, let's say.

668
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:32,693
And so we had to do
a lot of cheating and fudging

669
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,571
and one of them
was shooting this day in advance.

670
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:36,965
So it was kind of off-the-books.

671
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:41,785
WERNICK: It was a 48-day shoot,
which is, for a movie like this, tiny.

672
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,787
REYNOLDS: It's insane.
WERNICK: Tiny.

673
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:47,416
REYNOLDS: It's like a little independent
film shooting schedule so, yeah.

674
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:51,003
WERNICK: Most movies
of this scope and scale,

675
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:55,674
really, that's second unit days,
they have 48 days.

676
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,735
REYNOLDS: I'll invoke Green Lantern
for a second time.

677
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,929
Green Lantern, just to give
you a perspective, was an 89-day shoot.

678
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,909
- And this was 48.
- WERNICK: So we were lean and mean.

679
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:05,934
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

680
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,021
WERNICK: And really
the mother of invention, I feel like.

681
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,191
It just forced us to look at things
in a different way.

682
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,942
And attack things.

683
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,112
REYNOLDS: Necessity is truly
invention's mama.

684
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:18,572
And it, yeah...

685
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,826
It made us focus on character
so much more than anything else.

686
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,037
But we still got to do some fun stuff.

687
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,914
- Like that.
- REESE: Yeah.

688
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,642
I mean, among the scenes
we had to cut for budget,

689
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,501
we did have a motorcycle chase here,

690
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:35,964
where Deadpool was chasing Ajax
on a motorcycle.

691
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,193
REYNOLDS: I miss that sequence,
though. That would have been fun.

692
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,343
WERNICK: I loved that, too.

693
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,323
REYNOLDS: Regina, Saskatchewan.

694
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,349
That joke probably only makes
Canadians laugh,

695
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,975
but it makes me laugh.

696
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:53,190
Oh, and that is why Regina rhymes with fun.

697
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,985
WERNICK: Which, Ryan, tell us the story.
You were a child...

698
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,869
REYNOLDS: No, I was not,
I wish I was a child.

699
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,907
I was about 25 years old,
and I was in Regina, Saskatchewan.

700
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,867
And I got into a lot
of trouble because |I...

701
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,538
I messed with a sign and changed it.

702
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,183
I just actually put another sign over it,

703
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:12,167
so I didn't actually
vandalize public property,

704
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:15,170
but I put another sign over it that said,
"Welcome to Regina,

705
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,547
- "which rhymes with fun."
- (WERNICK CHUCKLES)

706
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:21,551
REYNOLDS: And I got into a lot of trouble
for that, but something good came out of it.

707
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,637
It's now in the Deadpool movie, so...

708
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,264
How about now?

709
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,891
WERNICK: That's all computer-generated
right there.

710
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,353
Ryan, obviously, wasn't in the scarred
makeup under the mask.

711
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,980
REYNOLDS: I sure wasn't.

712
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,357
WERNICK: When he was in the mask,
that was...

713
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,904
REESE: But something you just said,
where you said, "It makes me laugh,"

714
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,173
I think that's an important point

715
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,616
because so much
of the comedy in this movie,

716
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,620
we had to rely on our guts and say,
"Well, does it make us laugh?"

717
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:49,913
And we took that approach,

718
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:52,666
if it's making us laugh,
perhaps it will make others laugh.

719
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,710
And I think that held us
in pretty good stead.

720
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,378
REYNOLDS: I do, too. We had so...

721
00:29:56,545 --> 00:30:00,340
This is another one that just made us laugh
and people seem to like it.

722
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,466
(REYNOLDS LAUGHS)

723
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,135
It's T.J. Miller's favorite joke.

724
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:08,307
WADE: I think we can all agree that shit
just went sideways in the most colossal way.

725
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:14,563
REYNOLDS: There's our
Wolverine X-Men Origins reference.

726
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,773
I think, maybe our...

727
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,419
<i>(CHUCKLES) We only make two or three
references to it in the movie,</i>

728
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:20,777
but that's one of them.

729
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:23,155
WERNICK: You know what people don't get
is the one where,

730
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,882
"I'm gonna sew
your pretty little mouth shut."

731
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:25,967
REYNOLDS: And they say,
"I wouldn't do that."

732
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,051
WERNICK: "Oh, I wouldn't do that.""

733
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:30,221
- People don't click into that as much.
- REYNOLDS: I don't think they realize, yeah.

734
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,514
WERNICK: But it's, on
second viewing maybe, yeah.

735
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,539
REESE: Yeah.

736
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,249
WERNICK: Or third viewing.

737
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:39,004
REESE: Yeah, I do think the movie will have
a lot of second and third viewing

738
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,340
surprises for people
who miss things the first time.

739
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,067
REYNOLDS: Yeah, there's lots of jokes
that you miss.

740
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,343
REESE: Pretty rich in detail.

741
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:49,097
<i>REYNOLDS. I ran into Bernadette Peters,
which is just a weird thing to say,</i>

742
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:52,142
um, in New York City
maybe four months ago.

743
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:55,896
And she mentioned this scene
because she had to give her permission

744
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,856
for us to use her name.

745
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,942
And she was very flattered
and very sweet about it.

746
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:03,653
WERNICK: In our start gifts,

747
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:07,991
there was a signed Bernadette Peters

748
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,660
- framed 8x10 of her...
- REYNOLDS: Mmm.

749
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,748
...which I actually think Simon Kinberg
forged her signature.

750
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,911
REYNOLDS: I believe he did.

751
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,226
I found out for a fact that indeed,

752
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,212
Simon Kinberg
forged Bernadette Peters' signature,

753
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,065
- which is probably illegal.
- WERNICK: I think so.

754
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,382
Bernadette, if you're out there,

755
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,943
- we would love an original signed...
- REYNOLDS: Simon Kinberg.

756
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:29,679
- His number is 310-874...
- (WERNICK LAUGHS)

757
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,892
No one is boom-boxing shit. Okay?

758
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,062
We can fight this.

759
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,523
WERNICK: Rhett, talk about
some of the obscure references

760
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,150
to Yakov Smirnoff and, you know...

761
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:45,445
REESE: Well, I think we always felt that

762
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:48,657
not every reference had to make sense
for every audience member.

763
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,743
So we freed ourselves
and allowed ourselves occasionally

764
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,996
to make references that we thought
only a few people would get.

765
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,582
I mean, when you're talking about
Ronnie Milsap...

766
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:58,667
REYNOLDS: Oh, my God.

767
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:00,937
<i>...in a movie that's intended
for 17 to 34-year-olds,</i>

768
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,879
you're gonna go over some heads.

769
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:08,218
But we were committed to the idea
that Deadpool has a deep understanding

770
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,762
- and memory for pop culture.
- WERNICK: Yeah.

771
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,240
REESE: And that we just had to honor that.

772
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,491
REYNOLDS: But we all kind of do.

773
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,517
All three of us together are sort of...

774
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,102
- We love pop culture.
- REESE.: Yes.

775
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,914
REYNOLDS: I'm not saying that we
always understand it, but we love it.

776
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,481
We make a Cocoon joke in the movie.

777
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:23,733
I mean, that was fun. I love that.

778
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,694
WADE: Here, check it out.

779
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:29,990
WERNICK: Yeah. Usually they say,
pop culture, you have to...

780
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,534
Has to be a timeless reference
So that doesn't date the movie,

781
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,454
but again, as Rhett was saying,
the beauty of Deadpool is,

782
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:38,415
you can make
those obscure references for comedy.

783
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,684
REYNOLDS: Oh, yeah.
WERNICK: And it still works

784
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:44,171
and almost even enhances the movie
in such a way that...

785
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:45,755
REYNOLDS: Totally, yeah.

786
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,174
Look how happy you look here.

787
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,634
REYNOLDS: Paul, was that your joke?

788
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,571
The "Chechnya,
isn't that where you go to get cancer?"

789
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:52,655
WERNICK: Yeah.
REYNOLDS: I love that.

790
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,698
WERNICK: We added that in,
in ADR, actually.

791
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:54,723
REYNOLDS: (LAUGHS) Yeah.

792
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,933
It used to be "Chechnya.

793
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,120
- "I hear that's nice this time of never."
- WERNICK: Yeah.

794
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,897
REESE: Which is also fun.
WERNICK AND REYNOLDS: Also fun, yeah.

795
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,942
REESE: And we were setting up
a sequence in the movie

796
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:08,028
that will likely be in the deleted scenes

797
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,947
where Wade goes on a world tour
to get his cancer cured.

798
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,550
REYNOLDS: Oh, God, yeah.
That was good stuff.

799
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,701
REESE: And ultimately ends up
in Guadalajara, Mexico,

800
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,704
and meets a quack doctor
who's taking advantage of cancer victims

801
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,998
and ends up killing him
and feels guilty about it.

802
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:23,126
There's a whole sequence
we ended up taking out of the movie

803
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,628
after much long discussion.

804
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,522
And hopefully you'll find it
in the deleted scenes.

805
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,586
REYNOLDS: Yeah.
REESE: And if not... (CLICKS TONGUE)

806
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,050
- ...you're SOL.
- REYNOLDS: Yeah.

807
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,552
This is Jed Rees.

808
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:36,306
Local Vancouver actor,
guy I've known for maybe 20 years.

809
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,601
Great actor, fun, game for anything.

810
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,270
WERNICK: Galaxy Quest.

811
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:46,149
REESE: Yeah, he played the good alien
in Galaxy Quest.

812
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,069
REYNOLDS: He had fun on Deadpool.
He was very sad that we killed him

813
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,780
'cause he was hoping to be in the sequel.

814
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:57,244
WERNICK: And interestingly, Agent Smith,
obviously a nod to, um...

815
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,087
REESE: The Matrix. Yeah.
WERNICK: The Matrix.

816
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,331
Although some people
think his name is Agent Smith.

817
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,833
REYNOLDS: They just think his name
is Agent Smith.

818
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:07,254
REESE: Yeah, and that was
an improv of yours, wasn't it, Ryan?

819
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,714
The Agent Smith thing?
It made me laugh in the moment.

820
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:13,301
REYNOLDS: I think that was actually
your guys' writing. I think so.

821
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:16,721
(STAMMERING) I made
the horrible pedophile jokes,

822
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,224
I think, at the end of the scene, but...

823
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,308
REESE: So funny.

824
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,662
REYNOLDS: Agent Smith was
you guys, though, which I love, yeah.

825
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:27,023
WERNICK: Have you seen the GIF or "JIF,"
I'm not sure... That's going around?

826
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,526
It's you doing the Shake Weight
back and forth.

827
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,587
REYNOLDS: Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES)
WERNICK: It's really funny.

828
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,090
REYNOLDS: I have. I don't know...
I'm not sure how I feel about it.

829
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,883
- WERNICK: (LAUGHS) I love it.
- (REYNOLDS AND REESE LAUGH)

830
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,576
WERNICK: Made me laugh.

831
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,681
REYNOLDS: Can you imagine, we're gonna
have to start tailoring performances

832
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,748
to whether or not they'll be turned
into GIFs?

833
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:44,832
WERNICK: Yeah.

834
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,252
REYNOLDS: Is it "JIF" or "GIF?"
WERNICK: I think it's "GIF."

835
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,521
REYNOLDS: I thought we're pop culture...

836
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,172
- WERNICK: I know.
- ...savvy in some way, but, no.

837
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,675
I think it's "GIF."

838
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,138
WEASEL: What did he say?

839
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,431
(THUNDERCLAP)

840
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,516
(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)

841
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:06,271
REESE: I hate seeing that business card
with the "555" on it...

842
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,165
- REYNOLDS: Fuck.
- ...that always takes me out of the movie.

843
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,417
REYNOLDS: It just drove us all crazy.

844
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,502
WERNICK: It's actually Ryan's
cellphone number, isn't it?

845
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,004
REYNOLDS: Yes.
Do give it a shout, give It a try.

846
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,154
WERNICK AND REESE: Call it.

847
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,339
<i>WERNICK:. It doesn't even need
an area code.</i>

848
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,363
REYNOLDS: No.

849
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:17,883
WERNICK: You just do the seven numbers.

850
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:18,908
REYNOLDS: 555...

851
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:22,537
I can't believe we have that in there
and we don't even make a joke about it.

852
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,581
Hey. Sorry.

853
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,665
REYNOLDS: This is, uh...

854
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:31,421
...a joke from Rhett and Paul,
which is one of my favorites.

855
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,734
REESE: I think we
were at the front half of it

856
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:38,261
and then this was your improvised line
about him being a bad parent

857
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:40,472
- which made us laugh so hard.
- REYNOLDS: Oh, God.

858
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,808
Hey, uh, they've made
three of those movies.

859
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,480
At some point you have to wonder
if he's just a bad parent.

860
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,564
Hmm.

861
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:54,071
REYNOLDS: I've always liked that Deadpool,
or Wade Wilson in that moment,

862
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,071
he's obviously got
his mind on something else

863
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,574
and he's in this tragic moment,
but he still keeps up appearances.

864
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,117
Sort of shows how his mind works.

865
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:03,054
He's still making these jokes,
these random jokes.

866
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:06,331
He's even phoning them in,
but it's still a lot of fun.

867
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,583
WERNICK: Yeah, it's really, you know...

868
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:12,295
Wade Wilson, Deadpool's such a
complex character

869
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,005
that really, you know,

870
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:17,175
you look at his life
and there's so much tragedy in it.

871
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,886
And he hides behind that tragedy.

872
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:24,140
The comedy is what masks
the tragedy of his life.

873
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:29,312
And I feel that it really
makes him relatable

874
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:32,357
in a way that he's struggling with things

875
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,026
that everybody in real life struggles with

876
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,571
and deals with it in
his own particular way.

877
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:39,656
REYNOLDS: Mmm-hmm.

878
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,909
WADE: Pro: They pull down a gaggle of ass.

879
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,970
Local dry cleaning discounts.
Lucrative film deals...

880
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,579
WERNICK: Here comes fourth wall.

881
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:47,789
Another fourth wall moment.

882
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,959
Ryan, talk about Deadpool
and fourth wall and the comics.

883
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:55,338
REYNOLDS: Well, you can't have Deadpool
without him breaking the fourth wall.

884
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:59,968
That was the first thing that we all,
sort of, agreed upon years and years ago.

885
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,513
We tried to do as much of it
as made sense in the filming,

886
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,949
and actually, by the end of the movie,

887
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,058
we went back to camera
and shot a few extra ones

888
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,811
because we just felt like
we didn't have enough.

889
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,248
- I love breaking the fourth wall.
- WERNICK: And that's really...

890
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,566
It's really a signature of Deadpool
and was in the comics

891
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,443
- from the very start.
- REYNOLDS: Very much.

892
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:19,696
Negasonic Teenage...
What the shit?

893
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,575
WERNICK: And not only fourth wall
in that he's addressing the camera,

894
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:27,871
but he's also very aware
that he's in a movie

895
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,956
and that he's a superhero, right, Rhett?

896
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,374
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

Well, or not a superhero.

REYNOLDS: Yeah.
WERNICK: Yeah.

899
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,838
REESE: As the case may be, but, yes.

900
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,922
Can we go?

901
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,258
Look! I'm a teenage girl.

902
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,178
WERNICK: Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

903
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:50,018
Rhett, talk about, um,
how we stumbled onto her and...

904
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:55,523
REESE: Well, Tim, our director, wanted
some extra superheroes in the movie,

905
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,443
particularly on the X-Men side.

906
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,445
Colossus was already in there.

907
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,156
But we thought a trainee might be fun.

908
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:08,828
Tim gave us this list
of potential minor characters to use,

909
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:12,540
and Negasonic was on the list
and we just fell in love with the name.

910
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,918
We said, "Who cares
what she's like necessarily,

911
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,003
"but that name is just priceless."

912
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,631
So we built the character around the name.

913
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:28,348
WERNICK: Ryan Reynolds' ad-lib genius,
right there.

Well.

916
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:37,774
WERNICK: Uh, and NTW, her power,
she did not, in the comics,

917
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,152
she doesn't have the explosive power
that she has in our movie.

918
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:47,492
And for us to have added
that power to her resume,

919
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,410
we had to ask Marvel for permission.

920
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,704
But until then,
I'mma do what I came here to do.

00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,177
Quite unfortunate.

929
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:11,182
REESE: Colossus is a tremendous piece
of CG.

930
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,642
I mean, he's...

931
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:13,725
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

932
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,646
REESE: Just so impressive and I think
much better than he has been

933
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,356
in earlier incarnations.

934
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,692
REYNOLDS: Well, he's certainly
a faithful adaptation

935
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,610
- of Colossus now, so.
- REESE: Very much.

936
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,988
WERNICK: And really, uh,

937
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:29,993
it's an actor in a mo-cap suit. Andre...

938
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,036
REYNOLDS: Yeah.
Very hard to pronounce last name.

939

French Canadian name.
Tricoteux. Yeah.

But, great. Yeah, great actor.

941
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:40,169
WERNICK: So a lot of different pieces
went in to make Colossus.

942
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:44,007
Obviously, you have Andre,
who was on set in...

943
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,677
Who was, what, about a 6'5" giant,

944
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,055
- who wore platform boots...
- REYNOLDS: Mmm-hmm.

945
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,807
...to make himself about 6'8".

946
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,436
REYNOLDS: No, we had him...
He was about 7'5"

947
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,163
WERNICK: Is that right?
REYNOLDS: Is, I think, the height

948
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,456
that we ended up keeping Colossus.

949
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,500
REESE: We had that little tennis ball
on top of his head.

950
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,364
REYNOLDS: Yeah, to get him even higher.
REESE.: It was like a Teletubby.

951
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,657
WERNICK: And then there was
a facial capture

952
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,076
of another actor I don't know.

953
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,412
- Do you know who that actor was?
- REESE: I'm not sure.

954
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,080
But then there was a third gentleman

955
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,791
- who does the voice.
- REYNOLDS: Who does the voice. Yeah.

956
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,297
You ever see 127 Hours? Spoiler alert.

957
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,066
REYNOLDS: That was
one of my favorite jokes,

958
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,675
which was the McAvoy or Stewart joke,

959
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,303
which really kind of sums up Deadpool

960
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,972
in a very easy-to-digest way.

961
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,475
Just the understanding
of knowing he's in a movie,

962
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,186
the pop culture references
and the timelines.

963
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,270
WERNICK: Yeah.

964
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:43,024
REESE: When it came time
to create Colossus' face,

965
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:47,946
there was an internal push to have his face
be captured by Rob Gronkowski,

966
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,049
- to have them use Rob Gronkowski's face...
- REYNOLDS: Yes.

967
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,675
- ...as the face for Colossus.
- REYNOLDS: Yeah.

968
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,202
REESE: It didn't work out,
but it made us laugh.

969
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,499
WERNICK: The movie is told
in a non-linear format.

970
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,377
It bounces in and out of time and space.

971
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,978
We did that for a number
of different reasons, one of which, uh...

972
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,968
The big action sequence
which is on the freeway,

973
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:15,306
extends over the course of
the almost first half of the movie.

974
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:19,143
And we did that because budget was such

975
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:22,063
that we wanted to start the movie
with an action sequence

976
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,817
and have action sprinkled
throughout the first act,

977
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,612
but couldn't afford to do
three different action sequences,

978
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:34,367
so we structured the film such that

979
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:38,079
we started and then
bounced in and out of time and space.

980
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,341
This place seems sanitary.

981

REESE: This was shot in an old World War I
munitions factory.

982
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,306
So I think we all contracted

983
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,618
- some horrifying diseases by being there.
- REYNOLDS: Yeah.

984
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,019
It's gone now.

985
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:03,021
This was the last thing that was ever...

986
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,605
That building was ever used for.

987
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:07,358
It was bulldozed shortly after filming.

988
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:08,443
Easy.

00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,820

turned into condos, no doubt.

REYNOLDS: Gina, so fun, so tough.

993
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,624
But so gentle, for a
fighter. She's a fighter

994
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,128
and she never felt that comfortable
manhandling me.

995
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,505
I had to keep asking her to be rougher.

996

an absolute true warrior.

998
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:39,348
The most enthusiastic person
I think I've ever met.

999
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:41,160
- I've said that if he were...
- REYNOLDS: Oh...

1000
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:43,227
...on the deck of the Titanic
and it were sinking,

1001
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,289
he would be the only one
standing there doing a jig.

1002
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,398
He just doesn't have
a negative bone in his body.

1003
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:48,483
REYNOLDS: Unflappable.

1004
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,986
So, he's kind of
the perfect co-star, you know?

1005
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,365
Just shows up ready to work every day.

1006
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,243
- Good attitude. Yeah.
- WERNICK: Happy to be there.

1007
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:06,125
REYNOLDS: And great. Just really filled
Ajax out exactly how we'd hoped.

1008
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,671
But if you think superhuman powers
are acquired painlessly...

1009
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,592
WERNICK: He wasn't written British,

1010
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,845
but when we found Ed, when Tim cast Ed,

1011
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:25,186
we thought, "You know what?
It really adds to the character

1012
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,564
"to keep his British accent."
He's obviously British, so.

1013
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,276
I'm about to hurt you, Wade.

1014

I was a patient here once myself, you know.

1015

The treatment affects everyone differently.

1016

It made Angel inhumanly strong.

do you rely on sense memory?

1018
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,751
Or how do you trick yourself

1019

- into feeling pain that's not there?

1020

That's a good question.

1021
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,591
I've certainly had enough
accidents in my life

1022
00:43:55,675 --> 00:44:00,888

to kind of seize up like that,

1023

when you're in pain

REESE: Well, I would imagine acting,
in a lot of ways,

1032
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,704
is an exercise in deluding yourself, right?

1033
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,873
Because you're ultimately
deluding an audience,

1034
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:29,625
but at some level you have
to delude yourself to feel the things

1035
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:32,271
- that you're supposed to be feeling.
- REYNOLDS: Yeah, you just believe it.

1036
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:34,881
And it sounds easy enough,
but it's not that easy.

But you just believe it.

You just make yourself believe.

00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,553
with every insult you could possibly...

1049
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,120
WERNICK: Jose Canseco.

1050
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,539
REESE: China. Kevin Sorbo.

1051
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:09,749
REYNOLDS: Yeah, the, um...

1052
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,019
- Cries Angel Mindfreak.
- WERNICK: Cries Angel Mindfreak.

1053
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:15,296
REESE: The Busta Rhymes.
REYNOLDS: Busta Rhymes. (LAUGHS)

1054
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,191
WERNICK: I don't know,
are those going to be on the DVD?

1055
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,799
- I hope so.
- REYNOLDS: I hope so, too.

1056
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:23,846
REYNOLDS: I'm trying to remember,
there were a few more in there.

1057
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,825
REESE: And that ice bath was what,
warm water with plastic cubes in it?

1058
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,560
REYNOLDS: That ice bath
was boiling hot actually.

1059
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:31,187
It was too hot for me to stay in.

1060
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,207
And then to pretend
like you're freezing was just...

1061
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,816
WERNICK: And the goo was freezing,
was it the goo?

1062
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,629
REYNOLDS: No, the goo was just
the slipperiest substance known to man.

1063
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:41,989
I couldn't actually walk out of there
back to the trailer to get cleaned up.

1064
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,241
And it doesn't come off.

1065
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,384
It took me two days to get it off.

1066
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,928
WERNICK: And the tub was
too small too, right?

1067
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:48,037
REYNOLDS: Oh, yeah,
it was just a fucking nightmare.

1068
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:54,126
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.

1069
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,547
WERNICK: That's Worm,
Worm is from the comics.

1070
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,216
REYNOLDS: Yeah, he's in the comics.

1071
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,819
REESE: I don't think he's ever called Worm
in the movie, is he?

1072
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:03,886
REYNOLDS: Nope.

1073
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,012
WERNICK: It's Cunningham.

1074
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,823
REESE: Cunningham.
REYNOLDS: Yeah, we call him Cunningham.

1075
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,351
WERNICK: Which, I
think, is his actual name.

1076
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,704
REYNOLDS: Yeah, of course.
WERNICK: And then his nickname is Worm.

1077
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,480
Vanessa.

1078
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,236
I wanna see Vanessa.

1079
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:21,696
FRANCIS: You're lovely.

1080
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,800
REESE: I want my whole life to be lit
like that Vanessa moment right there.

1081
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:25,984
REYNOLDS: Right? God, I know.

1082
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,803
REESE: Just to be walking through
a Liz Taylor commercial.

1083
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:28,987
REYNOLDS: Yeah, just... Oh...

1084
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,871
REESE: White diamonds.
REYNOLDS: Right.

1085
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:32,790
I'm wearing white diamonds right now.

1086
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:36,544
Hey, don't take any shit from him,
Cunningham.

1087
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:41,048
REESE: I love this look
when he hears the word, "Francis."

1088
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:45,052
<i>I love seeing those eyes go up.
Ed's face has...</i>

1089
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,554
REYNOLDS: It's like a snake.

1090
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,037
REESE: Yeah, it's like
it casts shadows almost. It's so cool.

1091
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:52,977
WERNICK: Ajax from a dish soap.

1092
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:54,687
Huge laugh.

1093
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,000
Probably, in audiences we've seen,

1094
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,984
probably the third biggest laugh
of the movie.

1095
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,421
REYNOLDS: Yeah.
REESE: And we didn't see it coming at all.

1096
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,363
REYNOLDS: No, I never thought
it was really...

1097
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,366
WERNICK: In fact, Ajax, I don't even think
is a dish soap, is it?

1098
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,618
REYNOLDS: It is a cleaning product.

1099
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,555
- An abrasive cleaning product.
- REESE: A cleanser, yeah.

1100
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,419
REYNOLDS: I think it's like an all-purpose
counter cleaner or something.

1101
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,585
We just gave them about 500 grand
worth of advertising, by the way.

1102
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,669
(REESE LAUGHING)

1103
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:19,754
REYNOLDS: Right there.

1104
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,715
See, here's the problem
with round-the-clock torture...

1105
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:25,843
is that you can't really
step it up from there.

1106
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:28,512
REYNOLDS: To the three people that listen
to a DVD commentary.

1107
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,157
REESE: Yes.
WERNICK: Which will be us three

1108
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,241
- and that's it.
- REYNOLDS: Yeah.

1109
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,641
REESE: We have dirty kitchens.

1110
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,227
REYNOLDS: Yeah, absolutely.
REESE: We may need...

1111
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,415
FRANCIS: If this doesn't
unlock your mutation, then, well...

1112
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:42,193
REYNOLDS: This fucking machine.
I felt like I lived in it for two weeks

1113
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,836
even though it wasn't that long, but...

1114
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:45,363
God.

1115
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,466
WERNICK: In the script,
it was called the Punch Bowl.

1116
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,259
I don't think
it's called the Punch Bowl anymore.

1117
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,643
REYNOLDS: It's not anymore, yeah.
WERNICK: It's not anymore.

1118
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:55,164
REYNOLDS: But it really was... I really
was completely strapped into it.

1119
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:59,585
And it was just a...
Always a slightly disconcerting feeling

1120
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:03,547
to know that if that building caught
on fire, I'd basically be fucked.

1121
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:06,068
- People would be using me as a door mat.
- REESE: We were all gonna run.

1122
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:07,277
- REYNOLDS: Climbing over me...
- (REESE LAUGHING)

1123
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,636
...just to scramble outside.

1124
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,617
REESE: Come on, now, we would have...

1125
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:12,807
REYNOLDS: Wheeled me out?

1126
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,183
REESE.: Like the old pharaohs.

1127
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,494
We would have climbed
in there with you

1128
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,645
- and gotten burned alive.
- (REYNOLDS LAUGHING)

1129
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,523
REESE: Just to honor your sacrifice.

1130
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,150
WERNICK: I think the original Punch Bowl,

1131
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,569
the first Punch Bowl that came out was...

1132
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,155
I think cost three quarters
of a million dollars,

1133
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,908
I think, to make that prop.
I think it was our most expensive prop,

1134
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,619
next to your suit, which was
a little bit more expensive.

1135
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,056
REYNOLDS: That Punch Bowl
cost three quarters of a million dollars?

1136
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,164
WERNICK: Yes.
REYNOLDS: No.

1137
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,999
WERNICK: Yes, the first one did.

1138
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,727
REYNOLDS: Not this one, though.
WERNICK: Yes.

1139
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,853
REYNOLDS: Wait, really?
WERNICK: Yeah.

1140
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,605
REYNOLDS: I should know that.
That's... What?

1141
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,107
WERNICK: I'm pretty sure that's the case.

1142
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,526
REESE: Maybe you just made that up.
REYNOLDS: I don't believe you.

1143
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,778
- There's no way.
- REESE: We're getting to the bottom of this.

1144
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,882
WERNICK: Stand by.
REESE: Yeah, someone's in trouble.

1145
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:55,266
FRANCIS: You're never
going home after this.

1146
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,725
Now there's a brave face.

1147
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,437
WERNICK: And, my God,
when Ryan acted this scene.

1148
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,774
The breaths and the fighting for... It's...

1149
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,986
<i>REESE:. Well, you could watch
everyone at the monitors just...</i>

1150
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,571
WERNICK: I still... It's still...

1151
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,322
REESE: They were so ill at ease

1152
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:13,659
<i>just because it made them feel
like they were gasping for breath.</i>

1153
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,119
It was tough to watch.

1154
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,013
REYNOLDS: Suffocating.
What a terrible way to go.

1155
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,098
WERNICK: It's brilliantly acted.

1156
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,290
Oh, my God.

1157
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:23,043
And this must've been one of the harder
scenes just physically for you to do, Ryan,

1158
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:26,172
in terms of just what it took your body...

1159
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,425
The toll it took on your body,
this was intense.

1160
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,986
REYNOLDS: There was a lot of stuff
we cut out,

1161
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,762
which is really the
hardest part of it, I think.

1162
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,184
But we kept a few pieces in
and it was worth it.

1163
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,203
WERNICK: Oh...
REESE: Yeah, I think we ended up trimming

1164
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,479
down what was originally there

1165
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:42,706
because it was so oppressive.

1166
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,810
- It was just...
- REYNOLDS: It was a little intense.

1167
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,652
WERNICK: How did that
feel on your skin, Ryan?

1168
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,488
REYNOLDS: (CHUCKLES)
What?

1169
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:51,822
REESE: This is VFX.

1170
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,240
REYNOLDS: Computer-generated...

1171
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,051
WERNICK: (CHUCKLES) I know.
REYNOLDS: Good Lord.

1172
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,785
WADE: Did I say this was a love story?

1173
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,413
No, it's a horror movie.

1174
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:02,625
(SCREAMING)

1175
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,968
(GASPING)

1176
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:14,595
REYNOLDS: There he is.

1177
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:17,932
FRANCIS: Fucking hell.

1178
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:21,227
Looks like someone lost his shot
at Homecoming King.

1179
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,354
What have you done to me?

1180
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:26,732
I've merely raised your stress levels
high enough to trigger a mutation.

1181
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,068
You sadistic fuck!

1182
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:30,528
I've cured you, Wade.

1183
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:35,282
REYNOLDS: Now, some comic book fans
will be sad to hear

1184
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,885
that there was a scene that we cut out

1185
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:41,830
which actually has, Killebrew,
Dr. Killebrew in this sequence

1186
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:48,837
that after unbelievable debate,
we took out of the film.

1187
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,840
But it was with a heavy heart
we took it out.

1188
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:53,801
But it just had to go, it was...

1189
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:55,737
WERNICK: It was just one more layer
in the bad guy plot.

1190
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,054
REYNOLDS: Slowing us down.

1191
00:50:57,513 --> 00:51:01,267
WERNICK: That Ajax really worked
for Dr. Killebrew,

1192
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:05,729
who you didn't know was the mastermind
until the very end of the movie.

1193
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:06,855
REESE: Mmm-hmm.

1194
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:11,652
<i>I think audiences
just got a little bit confused</i>

1195
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:16,031
about the hierarchy and it just made sense,
ultimately, to simplify it.

1196
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,701
REYNOLDS: Yeah, and it's just
a straight revenge story

1197
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,053
you don't really want to mess with,

1198
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,204
and it's between these two guys.

1199
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:25,249
It's between Wade Wilson and Ajax.

1200
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:30,754
And adding that extra layer was tough,
it was tough to digest.

1201
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,673
WERNICK: Talk about the makeup, Ryan,

1202
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,396
- how long of a process was it...
- REYNOLDS: (CLICKS TONGUE) Oh...

1203
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:40,014
...lo put you in the face
and at times the full body makeup?

1204
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,475
Well, the full body one, it's just a pain
in the ass that's unavoidable.

1205
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:46,645
But this one's not too bad,
when you do arms and face.

1206
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:49,231
It's about uh, five hours.

1207
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:50,608
That's about five hours.

1208
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:51,734
But when you do full body

1209
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:56,363
which is the sequence that comes up after
this, so head-to-toe naked fight scene,

1210
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,950
full body, that's about
eight or nine hours.

1211
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,761
- And then you do a 15-hour shoot day...
- WERNICK: Oh, boy.

1212
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,496
...and you're working
25, 26 hours in a day,

1213
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,374
So tough days, but you don't complain.

1214
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,793
You just remind yourself

1215
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:12,314
that you're getting to make Deadpool
after 10 years of waiting.

1216
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:14,715
WERNICK: So, hours to put it on,

1217
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,216
and what about 30 seconds

1218
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,445
- to just rip it off yourself, right?
- (REYNOLDS LAUGHING)

1219
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:19,803
At the end of each day, man,

1220
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:23,098
I was counting the seconds to rip it off
and I would do it with my hands,

1221
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:29,146
which would totally aggravate our sweet,
incredible, genius makeup artist Bill Corso

1222
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,649
<i>because he was worried about my skin,</i>

1223
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:36,236
'cause when you rip it off it's epoxied
to your skin, so it's kind of damaging,

1224
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,698
but I didn't care,
I was just dying to get home.

1225
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,619
WERNICK: And you spend about a third,
a third, a third, I think.

1226
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:44,745
We broke it down.

1227
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,121
A third in the costume.

1228
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:47,414
A third in the makeup.

1229
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:52,544
A third as unscarred Wade Wilson,
before he became Deadpool.

1230
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:53,708
REYNOLDS: Yeah, that was...

1231
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:58,300
Well, the sort of equation
we felt would work best for the studio.

1232
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,404
And it ended up
working best for the film, too...

1233
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,628
- WERNICK: Yup.
- ...which aren't always the same, so...

1234
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:05,833
REESE: [ like the fact that, uh...

1235
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:09,269
That you got out by virtue of this match.

1236
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:11,355
I think a lot of times, as a screenwriter,

1237
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:15,651
you're trying to get your protagonist
locked in a box.

1238
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:21,155
And then figure out how to get them out
in a way that's not overly obvious.

1239
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:24,910
And we planted that match
in the mouth of Angel Dust,

1240
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:27,871
always with the intent
to have it be the device

1241
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:30,791
that Wade used to get out
of the Punch Bowl. That's kind of cool.

1242
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,001
REYNOLDS: Yeah, I always loved that, too.

1243
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:37,548
That was a nice plant pay-off,
as you call it.

1244
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,222
These scenes were fun.

1245
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,808
Ed Skrein is so physically gifted

1246
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,145
and he spent months and months training
with fighters and all kinds of stuff,

1247
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,482
and I think it really
shows in this sequence.

1248
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,986
He's so good, physically.

1249
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:04,158
Just has this kind of simian quality,
which is great.

1250
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:06,493
You don't want to kill me.

1251
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,912
I'm the only one
who can fix your ugly mug.

1252
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,930
WERNICK: Your penis there,

1253
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:29,141
that's your actual penis, yes, Ryan?

1254
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,660
- (REESE LAUGHING)
- REYNOLDS: Of course it is.

1255
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,311
(REYNOLDS CHUCKLES)

1256
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,062
100%.

1257
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:37,024
My penis looks like pepperoni flatbread.

1258
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,817
(WERNICK AND REESE LAUGHING)

1259
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,285
WERNICK: I can vouch for that.
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

1260
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:43,906
(REYNOLDS LAUGHING)

1261
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:55,000
REYNOLDS: Kind of a terrible way to die,
I would imagine.

1262
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:59,213
WERNICK: But a great way
to discover your powers.

1263
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,297
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

1264
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:07,221
What's my name?

1265
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,515
REYNOLDS: That fucking room.

1266
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,518
Had to be 145 degrees.

1267
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:14,812
I mean, it was just intense.

1268
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:18,398
So much fire,
So much heat trapped in there.

1269
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:19,983
Fire marshal kept shutting us down

1270
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:22,361
because the interior temperature
rose to such a degree

1271
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:25,489
that it was a huge fire hazard, so...

1272
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,324
It was a long, slow day.

1273
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,326
WERNICK: And this was
the 25-hour day, right?

1274
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:36,166
REYNOLDS: This was the 25-hour
shooting day for me.

1275
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,812
REESE.: It's not as though we were shooting
in an ex-munitions factory

1276
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:39,837
that might explode.

1277
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,960
REYNOLDS: (LAUGHS) I know.

1278
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,091
Ugh, genius location manager.

1279
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,945
REYNOLDS: Another sort of God-awful...

1280
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,639
REESE: Yeah, this scene
was originally followed by a sequence

1281
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:54,601
in which Wade tested out
his invulnerability

1282
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:57,646
by committing suicide in ridiculous ways.

1283
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,398
And it... Gosh, it made us laugh.

1284
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,233
He was throwing himself
out of subway cars,

1285
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,985
and jumping into polar bear enclosures,

1286
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:07,990
and doing all kinds of...
All kinds of self-destructive things.

1287
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:11,034
But ultimately I think that, for the tone,

1288
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:13,871
it just made more sense
to keep this reasonably serious.

1289
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:18,709
WERNICK: The tone of this movie, it was
a real, you know, juggling act

1290
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:23,547
in terms of bouncing in and out
of darkness and humor and...

1291
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:29,136
If done wrong, it can be a disaster.

1292
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:33,432
It can feel, you know,
schizophrenic and inconsistent,

1293
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:38,312
but I think, you know,
we all managed to string together

1294
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:42,190
the movie in such a way
that the tone really does work.

1295
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:43,901
It's a ride, you know, in and out...

1296
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,903
REYNOLDS: Mmm-hmm.

1297
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:49,406
...of fun and tragedy, and sadness and...

1298
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:53,702
REYNOLDS: Made the edit room
a real roller coaster ride, though.

1299
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:54,929
- There was a lot of different...
- WERNICK: Yes.

1300
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,724
REYNOLDS: When you shoot a movie
that has a fractured narrative like this,

1301
00:56:57,748 --> 00:56:59,249
you can really kind of...

1302
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,376
You can compose the movie
in so many different ways,

1303
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,740
and so many different timelines.

1304
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,814
I mean, at one point,
we experimented with a linear timeline

1305
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:08,425
which was just a disaster,
a nightmare for us, 'cause it was never...

1306
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,511
Obviously, it was never written that way
by Rhett and Paul and it just...

1307
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,514
Presented a lot of problems but, um...

1308
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:17,976
WERNICK: And again, I think
that has to do with tone, it's, you know...

1309
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:23,440
The origin story of Deadpool is so dark.

1310
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:27,152
You know, a character who has cancer
who loses his, you know...

1311
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:28,570
You know,

1312
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:31,365
scarring and loses his girl.

1313
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:36,244
I feel like the non-linear nature
allowed us to bounce in and out

1314
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:43,293
of, you know, tones that created
not too much darkness

1315
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:45,629
over a long period of time,

1316
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,715
that you could give the audience
breaks of the darkness,

1317
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,842
amongst the comedy and lightness...

1318
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:52,646
- REYNOLDS: Hmm.
- ...of him being Deadpool.

1319
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,250
REYNOLDS: Typical summer day
in Vancouver, British Columbia.

1320
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,606
Come on, Wade, it can't be that bad.

1321
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:05,983
Bullshit!

1322
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:09,277
I'm a monster inside and out.
I belong in a fucking circus.

1323
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,989
Wade, Vanessa loves you.
She doesn't care what you...

1324
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:13,699
Oh! Oh.

1325
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:14,783
Do you like what you see?

1326
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,078
REYNOLDS: You could've cut together
an entire film

1327
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,331
just of T.J. Miller doing
alternate jokes here.

1328
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:23,834
Not gently. Like it was hate-fucking.

1329
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,436
There was something wrong
with the relationship...

1330
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,461
(WERNICK CHUCKLES)

1331
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:28,231
...and that was the only catharsis that
they could find...

1332
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:29,816
REYNOLDS: The only reason we stopped
shooting the scene

1333
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,009
was 'cause T.J., eventually,
had to go to sleep.

1334
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,301
(REESE LAUGHING)

1335
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,197
- We also shot the scene twice.
- REYNOLDS: Yeah. This is the second...

1336
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,992
REESE: Because we had to alter some key
information in the middle of it,

1337
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:41,143
so we shot this whole scene,
and it was working great,

1338
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,270
and then we had to go back and do it again.

1339
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,647
And we were afraid,
"Are we gonna recapture the magic?"

1340

until somebody gives up Francis...

then put a bullet in his skull...

1344

and fuck the brain hole.

1345

I don't wanna see that
or think of it again.

REYNOLDS: That is kind of stolen

1347
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:07,002
from Dan Aykroyd in Grosse Pointe Blank
when he says

1348

that he's gonna fuck
the brain-hole of someone,

1349

believe it or not,
Just Deadpool going on random Kills

while Ajax was waiting
to get out of prison.

1379

Ajax had gone to prison
at the end of the workshop fight.

1380

And Deadpool was just biding his time,
waiting for Ajax to get out of prison.

1381
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,879
But somebody, I think it might
have been Simon, had the bright idea

1382
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:38,468
to make this montage
into a search for Ajax.

1383
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,303
So, Ajax doesn't go to prison,

1384
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:41,513
and Deadpool goes on a

1385

for his arch enemy.

some propulsive energy.

Fox has immense trust in him.

He's the keeper of the
X-Universe and, uh...

"God, I miss cocaine."

1491
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,594
And she just says it
without even thinking about it. (LAUGHS)

1492
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:14,619
WERNICK: Oh, she's great.

1493
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:16,746
REYNOLDS: She is just so...

1494
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,915
WERNICK: And a very talented actress.

1495
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:22,043
REYNOLDS: And an incredible singer,
one of the great singers.

1496
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:24,838
WERNICK: Was in Roots, yes?

1497
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:29,384
I'm not gonna go there
'cause I'm not 100% sure

1498
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:32,345
but I know she sang with Frank Sinatra.
She's done a...

1499
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:34,156
REESE: She was on The Muppet Show,
I know that.

1500
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,306
REYNOLDS: Oh, yeah.

1501
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:38,685
WERNICK: Uh, talk about the Crocs, Ryan.
That was a Ryan, um...

1502
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:41,438
REYNOLDS: Oh, yeah, the big, rubber,
masturbating shoes.

1503
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:44,899
Yeah, the Crocs were sort of an addition
that we liked, I don't know, just to

1504
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:46,544
- you know, adding as much...
- WERNICK: Character, yeah.

1505
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:48,778
...kind of weird character
with Deadpool as possible.

1506
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:54,576
I like that he had his specific shoes
that he liked to masturbate with.

1507
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:59,456
The Ikea is something that the boys here

1508
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:02,542
had in the script for six years which is...
I love.

1509
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,497
WERNICK: Just weird, you know, it's...
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

1510
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:09,466
WERNICK: But it's Deadpool weird
and that's why it works.

1511
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:13,678
REESE.: I just like that they have
this whole language, this whole

1512
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:15,614
- (CHUCKLES) Swedish language, there.
- REYNOLDS: Yeah.

1513
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,438
REYNOLDS: This was actually our first
official day of shooting, though.

1514
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:20,870
WERNICK: And you know, it's interesting

1515
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:24,647
because the, you know, the
traditional studio note would be,

1516
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:30,570
"Wait, he just lost his arm, his girl
and the bad guy,

1517
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:33,823
"and he's talking about Ikea?"

1518
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:37,076
"That doesn't work.
You've got to get him back on track."

1519
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:41,039
You know, again,
Deadpool allows you to break all the rules

1520
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:44,042
and we jumped at the chance.

1521
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,168
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

1522
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:49,631
REESE: I think the only rule with Deadpool
is to break the rules.

1523
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:51,394
REYNOLDS: True.
REESE: If that makes sense.

1524
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:54,445
Catching him was my only chance to be
hot again, get my super sexy ex back...

1525
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:55,779
REYNOLDS: And then,
we're back on point here,

1526
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:58,306
we're sort of saying
what's really going on.

1527
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,642
WERNICK: That is lavender wasabi lotion?

1528
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:05,021
REYNOLDS: Lavender wasabi lotion,
my unicorn wearing assless leather chaps,

1529
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,424
and the unicorn has a tiny penis.

1530
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,441
For the record.

1531
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:11,277
WERNICK: Nevin Swain.

1532
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,821
REYNOLDS: Nevin Swain,
our incredible props guy.

1533
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,925
I would call Nevin in the middle
of the night and say,

1534
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:21,704
"Nevin, I need a tiny, stuffed unicorn
wearing assless chaps and...

1535
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:23,706
"And a proportionate penis."

1536
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:26,501
And he would have that for me
pretty much within 12 hours.

1537
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:27,584
(REESE LAUGHING)

1538
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:30,356
WERNICK: And he would say, "Is this
for the movie or your personal needs?"

1539
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,649
REYNOLDS: And we would... Often times,

1540
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:32,983
- the line was blurred.
- WERNICK: Both.

1541
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,467
(WERNICK LAUGHS)

1542
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,530
REYNOLDS: I can't even get an erection

1543
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:39,281
- unless I have a unicorn in the room.
- (WERNICK LAUGHS)

1544
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,307
I just... I don't even care who knows that.

1545
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,118
Obviously, 'cause I'm saying it
on the commentary.

1546
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:44,143
REESE: Oh, my...

1547
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:45,728
He can't.

1548
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,356
Not if there's nothing
left of him to heal.

1549
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:52,485
You know, it's funny.
I almost miss the fucker.

1550
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,321
I like a challenge.

1551
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:58,700
But he's bad for business.

1552
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,577
Now let's go find him.

1553
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:02,328
Oh.

1554
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,956
(WADE GRUNTS SLOWLY)

01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,332
Tylenol PM?

1556
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,544
REYNOLDS: What I love about
this scene is that

1557
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:14,799
there's a weirdly, like, sweet energy
between Blind Al and Wade.

1558
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:18,803
In a weird way, it kind of lets us forgive

1559
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:21,156
how hostile they are toward each other
half the time, you know.

1560
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,780
WERNICK: Yeah, I mean, you know, it's...

1561
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:26,102
You love this woman and she loves you.

1562
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:30,607
And it's really, um...
As abusive as the relationship is, it's...

1563
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:34,193
There's a real love behind it and a warmth.

1564
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,779
Find this woman...
and tell her how you feel.

1565
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:40,116
What do I keep telling you, Mrs. Magoo?
She wouldn't have me.

1566
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,535
WERNICK: She's like the oracle here,
you know.

1567
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:44,203
Looks are everything.

1568
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,372
You ever heard David Beckham speak?

1569
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,017
It's like he mouth-sexed
a can of helium.

1570
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:51,294
REESE: Not many movies
where the protagonist is played by an actor

1571
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,838
and references that same actor
within the movie.

1572
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:56,966
You're blind.

1573
01:08:57,592 --> 01:09:00,053
So, you're just gonna lie there
and whimper?

1574
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,656
WERNICK: And in the comics,
Ryan Reynolds is referenced in the comics.

1575
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,806
REESE: He is, yeah.

1576
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:08,311
In the meantime,
you might wanna leave the room.

1577
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,064
I bet it feels huge in this hand.

1578
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:14,275
WERNICK: I say that line all the time.

(REYNOLDS LAUGHING)

1580

WEASEL.: So, the doctor says,

1581
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:18,964
"The bad news is
you don't have that long to live."

1582
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,507
So, the patient says,
"How long do I have?"

1583
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:21,574
The doctor says, "Five."

1584
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,994
REESE: This was a joke that
T.J. just broke out on the day.

1585
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:26,263
- And we thought it was nice...
- REYNOLDS: Is it?

1586
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:27,473
REESE: 'Cause it dovetailed thematically.

1587
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,016
REYNOLDS: Is it an original joke of his?

1588
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,059
WERNICK: I don't think so.

1589
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:31,685
REESE: No, I just think it's one
of those classic jokes

1590
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,312
that you just hear
and it gets told and retold.

1591
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:34,563
REYNOLDS: I can never tell a joke.

1592
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,090
Like, I have never...
I can't retain them for some reason.

1593
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,217
I've never been able
to be that guy who just...

1594
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,261
WERNICK: No. My dad is a great,
great joke-teller...

1595
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,198
- REYNOLDS: Really?
- ...one of the great joke-tellers, yeah.

1596
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:45,699
- I don't have that...
- REYNOLDS: Such a gift.

1597
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:46,724
WERNICK: It is.

1598
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:49,867
REESE: Well, T.J.'s got a bunch of them.

1599
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,647
He is a student of comedy.

1600
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,416
REYNOLDS: He really is.
REESE: And the history of comedy,

and stand-up and joke-telling.

1602

Just everything, he's the guy.

1603
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,207
WERNICK: We called him
Benjamin Button on set

1604
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:06,452
because he would always button a scene
with an improv joke.

1605
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:09,497
REYNOLDS: (LAUGHS) Yeah.
WERNICK: He does it at the back end here.

1606
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,475
REYNOLDS: He does about 50 of them
at the back end here,

1607
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:13,793
where we had to, eventually,
run out of digital...

to do something like that.

who turn it on for the camera
and aren't funny in real life.

And T.J.'s not one of those.
He's funny in real life, too.

I can't believe I'm doing this.

Is there a word for half afraid,
half angry?

Yeah, "afrangry," I guess.

you're gonna say to her?

Or as I like to call her, Irony.

1632
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:26,365
REESE: There was a thought
that we needed to make

01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:30,536
Stan Lee's dialogue
as realistic as possible,

1634

so Paul got assigned the task
of talking to the real strip club MC

1635
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:37,627
and writing down lines
that he might really say

01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:41,940
WERNICK: Really kind of the low point
of my screenwriting career...

1638
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,984
REESE: That was probably the low point
of Paul's career.

1639
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:45,718
...when I'm sitting across
from a guy...

1640
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:47,178
(REYNOLDS LAUGHING)

1641
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:50,848
...and he's saying,
"Show me them big ol titties!"

1642
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:51,933
REYNOLDS: Oh, God.

1643
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:56,562
Needless to say,
Stan didn't say any of those lines.

1644
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:57,730
REESE: He was game to do it

1645
01:11:57,814 --> 01:12:01,442
but there was a line that he drew in terms
of exactly what he'd be willing to say.

1646
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:02,527
WERNICK: Fortunately.

1647
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:20,545
Just Ryan's face right here, it's just...

1648
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:21,838
Wow, it's just...

1649
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:24,900
REESE: Yeah, I mean there are multiple
times in the movie where I feel like that.

1650
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,610
When you first learn
you have terminal cancer,

1651
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,052
and you're looking at Vanessa,

1652
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:29,666
you could freeze-frame that face

1653
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:31,990
and show it to anybody
in the world and say,

1654
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,140
"What's going on here?"

1655
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:36,435
And they could tell you that
this guy is in a horrible situation.

1656
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:39,355
And the same with this,
the longing... It just...

1657
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:41,315
You have a really wonderful ability

1658
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:44,986
to reveal an emotion on your face
without doing much.

1659
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:47,196
WERNICK: Talk about Ryan
acting behind that...

1660
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,573
REYNOLDS: Thank you.

1661
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,908
WERNICK: Because, really,
you're in a mask here as well.

1662
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:52,427
- I mean, all that makeup.
- REESE: Yeah.

1663
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:53,762
WERNICK: It's thick, there's glue.

1664
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:56,664
You can't really move your face
as naturally as you want.

1665
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:57,766
Talk about what that's like.

1666
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:00,227
REYNOLDS: In that instance...
In these instances, it's very helpful...

1667
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:02,879
I mean, Bill Corso is so gifted at...

1668
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,069
You know, applying prosthetic makeup

1669
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:08,885
isn't just, you know, throwing a mask
on somebody and calling it a day.

1670
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:11,345
It's really like using the face
that's already there

1671
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:14,181
and creating something else.

1672
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:18,895
And Bill gave me that ability to really,
kind of, emote through that makeup,

1673
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:22,940
and I say that he, sort of, in a weird way,
did half my job for me.

1674
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:24,650
And that's true.

1675
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:30,364
I mean, I would leave that makeup trailer
with really half the job done already.

1676
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,010
And I'm so grateful
that he was on the movie.

1677
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:34,619
He was my first call.

1678
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:35,888
When I knew we were gonna do this movie,

1679
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:37,389
when we got the green light
from the studio,

1680
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,249
I called Bill Corso
lo check if he was available.

1681
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,001
And thank God he was.

1682
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:47,006
WERNICK: One of the few times it was
actually not raining in Vancouver,

1683
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,257
that we had to create rain.

1684
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:49,342
REYNOLDS: (LAUGHS)
I know.

1685
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:50,760
I know.

1686
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:54,013
REESE: I always wonder
if the audience is at all

1687
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,474
genuinely surprised that it's Ajax,
and not you here.

1688
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:58,493
REYNOLDS: I don't think so.
REESE: I don't think so, either.

1689
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:01,270
- I think they're ahead of us.
- REYNOLDS: I know. Yeah.

1690
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:04,231
Uh, I saw her head to the back.
Go get her, tiger.

1691
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:13,407
REESE: That was a sly wink
to the Spider-Man line.

1692
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:15,785
REYNOLDS: Mmm-hmm.
REESE: And it comes back once more.

1693
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:16,869
REYNOLDS: Yup.

1694
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:24,627
REESE: And Bernadette Peters became
the link to indicate to Wade

1695
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:29,256
that Vanessa was grabbed from this alley
in a violent fashion.

1696
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:33,886
Motherfucker!

1697
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:36,263
- Wait, wait. Let's... Just...
- Cock juggling...

1698
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,790
- We can talk about what we're gonna...
- Jiminy! Fuck face!

1699
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:40,327
REYNOLDS: Oh, I hit that thing hard.

1700
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:42,603
I remember that really, really fucking hurt

1701
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:44,313
my wrist. (LAUGHS)

1702
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:45,481
WERNICK: Oh, man.

1703
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,358
Such an intense scene, such a...

1704
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:50,319
REYNOLDS: I gave Tim Miller
two takes of this.

1705
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:54,281
I said, "You get two takes,
and then, that's it."

1706
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,632
- I'm gonna get angry.
- Okay. All right.

1707
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,536
All right. Okay. All right.

1708
01:14:58,703 --> 01:14:59,912
Here. This is Vanessa.

1709
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:01,998
- What?
- No, wait. It's Francis.

1710
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,791
He wants you to come to him.

1711
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:07,294
REESE: This is a great little foreshadowing
of the marketing campaign

1712
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:08,855
- where they use those emojis...
- (REYNOLDS LAUGHING)

1713
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:09,879
...on the billboards.

1714
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,483
- I didn't realize that.
- REYNOLDS: The Deadpool, yeah.

1715
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,342
Those all started as a text message,
you know.

1716
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:15,445
REESE: Oh, is that right?
REYNOLDS: Deadpool emoji, yeah.

1717
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:16,679
All right. Okay.

1718
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:26,522
WERNICK: Our third movie
we've had produced, Rhett and I,

1719
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:31,444
and our third "Arm up, grab the gun" scene
around the house.

1720
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:32,570
REESE: Yeah.

1721
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:34,321
We like the arming-up scene.

1722
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:35,406
REYNOLDS: Yup.

1723
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,741
(REYNOLDS LAUGHS)

1724
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:38,826
That's about 3,000 rounds.

1725
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,161
REYNOLDS: Hugh Jackman.

1726
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,748
I love that Hugh Jackman does appear
in our movie in that regard

1727
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:45,207
just because he is...

1728
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:47,209
I often think of Hugh Jackman as the guy

1729
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:51,005
that kind of ushered in the cool
comic book character again

1730
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:55,468
because when he created Wolverine,
and created that character, and...

1731
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,803
Just so...
I think it just so changed the game.

1732
01:15:57,887 --> 01:15:59,930
It was a strange thing that it ushered in

1733
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:03,184
a whole new wave of comic book movies
that were cool again and...

1734
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,353
REESE: Yeah, he's like our
spiritual godfather.

1735
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:09,565
REYNOLDS: Yeah, he really is
and such a sport, you know.

1736
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:13,611
Was such a huge supporter of this movie

1737
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:15,321
and it getting made with the studio

1738
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:18,532
because he's obviously one of the biggest
stars the studio works with.

1739
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:22,495
I definitely owe him a debt of gratitude.

1740
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:24,330
Listen, Al...

1741
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:29,543
if I never see you again, I want you
to know that I love you very much.

1742
01:16:29,627 --> 01:16:31,879
REESE: This was Ryan's idea,
this cocaine bit.

1743
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:36,592
And also, there's about 116 kilos of
cocaine buried somewhere in the apartment...

1744
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:39,470
right next to the cure for blindness.
Good luck.

1745
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:42,431
REESE.: It's this seesawing
between sentiment and emotion,

1746
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:46,018
and then undercutting that
with just cynicism and cruelty.

1747
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:47,887
(REYNOLDS AND REESE LAUGHING)

1748
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:49,730
REYNOLDS: But there's a little truth there.

1749
01:16:49,814 --> 01:16:53,609
I think Deadpool does really love her
and wonders if he'll ever see her again.

1750
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:56,112
But he always has to
kind of undercut it with...

1751
01:16:56,195 --> 01:17:00,282
WERNICK: "Wanna get fucked up?"
The TV version that T.J...

1752
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:02,552
REYNOLDS: Oh, yeah, what was it?
WERNICK: "Wanna get felt up?"

1753
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:05,013
REYNOLDS: Oh, yeah, which is worse.
WERNICK: Which is actually worse.

1754
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:07,237
REYNOLDS: So much worse
but totally fine for television.

1755
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,291
Go on then.

1756
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:14,296
Thanks, dickless. And I mean you.

1757
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:17,967
Wow. You're a talker too. You and Wade.

1758
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:21,262
I've been trying to tell you assholes,
you've got the wrong girl.

1759
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:22,847
My old boyfriend, he's dead.

1760
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:26,475
See, I thought that too.
But he keeps on coming back.

1761
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:27,559
Like a cockroach...

1762
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:28,978
WERNICK: "Or like a bad Jesus."

1763
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,313
REYNOLDS: There was a line
that Rhett and Paul had for...

1764
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:33,792
As an alternate there,
"It keeps coming back like a bad Jesus,"

1765
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:36,944
and I'll always be sad that
that's not actually in the movie.

1766
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:40,156
For whatever reason, it got C-Blocked.

1767
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:43,826
WERNICK: This mansion is in...
Where is this mansion?

1768
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,095
REYNOLDS: It's in Vancouver.
WERNICK: Vancouver.

1769
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:46,638
REYNOLDS: Shaughnessy area,
Vancouver, yeah.

1770
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:47,830

You guys going for a bite?
Early bird special?

Like there's something wrong with
eating before sundown or saving money.

No, you know that bad guy
that you let go?

01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:18,461
I'm gonna wait out here, okay?

1785
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:20,589
It's a big house.
It's funny that I only ever see two of you.

1786
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:23,908
It's almost like the studio
couldn't afford another X-Man.

1787
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:25,635
WERNICK: Ladies and gentlemen,
Ryan Reynolds.

1788
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:28,096
- The genius of Ryan Reynolds right there.
- (REYNOLDS LAUGHING)

1789
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,389
- That was...
- WERNICK: Biggest laugh of the movie.

1790
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:33,417
REYNOLDS: That one I love,
it was just funny 'cause it's true.

1791
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,795
REESE: It is just about
the biggest laugh of the movie.

1792
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:40,549
WERNICK:! sat behind Jim Gianopulos,
who's the head of Fox,

1793
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:44,094
when that joke played,

1794
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:46,889
- and he was howling, laughing so hard.
- REYNOLDS: Yeah.

1795
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:48,724
He's also laughing because it's true.

1796
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:50,643
- WERNICK: True, yeah.
- (REYNOLDS CHUCKLES)

1797
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:53,103
REESE: Colossus is written
on that Starbucks cup.

1798
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:55,940
Unfortunately, you can't quite get enough
of a glimpse of it.

1799
01:18:56,023 --> 01:18:59,526
But I just love the idea of him
going into the Starbucks...

1800
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,362
WERNICK: "What's your name?" "Colossus."

1801

(MAN SCREAMS)

1802
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,408
WERNICK: That's your scream, Ryan, yes?

1803
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:07,910
REYNOLDS: Yes, that is my scream.

1804
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,078
WERNICK: You play Bandhu.

1805
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:11,001
REYNOLDS: I guess
I do technically play Bandhu.

1806
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:13,183
WERNICK: Are you listed
in the credits as Bandhu?

1807
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:14,434
REESE: I didn't even think about that.

1808
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,168
REYNOLDS: I don't know, I have no idea.

1809
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:17,479
WERNICK: You should be.
REESE: Yeah.

1810
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,981
REYNOLDS: I do a couple of screams
and yells for other people, too.

1811
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:21,233
WERNICK: Really?
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

1812
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:22,297
He's tied up in the trunk.

1813
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:23,884
I'm doing as you said, DP.

1814
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:27,846
I plan to gut him like a tandoori fish,
then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep.

1815
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:30,724
I did not tell him to do that.

1816
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:33,477
Absolutely not.
It got lost in translation.

1817
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:36,730
Dopinder, this is no way
to win Gita's heart back!

1818
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:37,999
(WHISPERS) I'm so proud of you.

(WERNICK AND REESE CHUCKLING)

1820
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:41,443
Kill him.

1821
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:45,364
REESE: This is a very big crowd
pleaser, too, this little bit right here.

1822
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:46,907
REYNOLDS: Love it.

1823
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:49,702
Also funny 'cause it's true.

1824
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:51,996
<i>Whoa!</i>

1825
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:57,376
I presume a crisp high five?

1826
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:58,877
For you? 10.

1827
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:03,048
Okay, guys, let's get out there
and make a difference.

1828
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:05,092
(WHISPERS) You know what to do.

Knock 'em dead, Pool Boy!

1831
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:13,559
REESE: We intended to have DMX,
X Gonna Give It To Ya, in there

1832
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,394
from the very earliest draft of the script.

1833
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:19,481
We just love that song and, thankfully,
it made it all the way through.

1834
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:21,376
WERNICK: And it's become the anthem
of the movie, in a way.

1835
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,400
REYNOLDS: It really has.

1836
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:25,523
REESE: Yeah, they used it in marketing.
REYNOLDS: Every commercial and it's...

1837
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:29,504
And Chimichanga, we have...
That's our chimichanga reference there.

1838
01:20:29,533 --> 01:20:30,813
We had to have that in the film.

1839
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,120
REESE: Yeah.

1840
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:34,246
And, uh...

1841
01:20:35,122 --> 01:20:37,916
This third act action...

1842
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:43,380
Tim Miller did such a wonderful job
of balancing budget vs action,

1843
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:48,177
and giving us scope and scale

1844
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,030
- with not a lot of money in this sequence.
- REYNOLDS: Mmm.

1845
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:53,265
REESE: I mean, particularly this massive
fight between Colossus and Angel Dust.

God damn it!

1852
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:09,126
I'm gonna do this the old fashioned way...

1853
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:12,618
with two swords and maximum effort.

1854
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:16,038
WERNICK: "Maximum effort"
was a catchphrase.

1855
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:19,541
Was that a comic catchphrase or
did you come up with that, Ryan?

1856
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,227
REYNOLDS: Oh, I thought
you guys came up with that.

1857
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:23,063
- I don't know. I love it.
- WERNICK: [ can't... Yeah, yeah...

1858
01:21:23,087 --> 01:21:24,397
REYNOLDS: But I always thought
it was you.

1859
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:26,840
WERNICK: I can't remember exactly
but, uh...

1860
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:29,635
He uses it now three times
in the movie, I think?

1861
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,804
REYNOLDS: Yeah, love it.

1862

What's my name?

Oh, I'mma fuckin' spell it out for ya.

1864

1865
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,402
- Stripes, Francis.
- REYNOLDS: Yeah.

1866
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:48,046
WERNICK: I don't know
if you guys remember...

1867
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:50,197
REYNOLDS: On the television in the bar.
WERNICK: Yup.

1868
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:52,044
REYNOLDS: I wish it was still there but...

1869

WADE: Totally impractical. They all do it.

You're a lovely lady,
but I'm saving myself for Francis.

REYNOLDS: Yeah, she's a...
She was a hell of a find.

01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:30,863
Just such a great look to her as well.

1885
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:43,184
When's the last time we saw that
in a movie? Is it ever...

1886
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,352
REYNOLDS: Never, never.
WERNICK: Never, never.

1887
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:47,880
REYNOLDS: Nobody's ever put it in as it is
in the comics until now and...

1888
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:50,132
I'm very proud of that and, you know,

1889
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:51,655
we gotta thank Tim for that as well.

1890
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:55,637
Tim really was a huge supporter
of, you know, canon and

1891
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:57,639
always staying faithful to the comics.

1892
01:22:57,723 --> 01:23:00,309
And one of the things was the
X-Suit that she's wearing.

1893
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:01,768
And the other thing |I...

1894
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:05,063
The other big get was both
Colossus and, of course, Deadpool.

1895
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:08,650
You know, his suit being
so faithful to the comics as well.

doing the fighting.

WERNICK: As you know, she's MMA and...

1898
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:20,162
A pretty badass.

1899
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,769

to really do that.

there's a tiny shit streak

1904
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:36,220
on that underwear that they...

1905
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:39,097
That they never really
captured on film but...

1906
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:41,350
WERNICK: That was a real shit streak,
was it not?

(GRUNTING)

REYNOLDS: This is one of
my favorite pieces of action.

1914
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,794
So nasty but so fun.

1915

WERNICK: Your stunt double, Alex,

1916
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,967
tore his ACL in this scene.

1917
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:19,596
REYNOLDS: Oh, it had just exploded
in this scene and I felt so horrible.

1918
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:23,767
Because he blew his knee out
so I wouldn't blow mine out.

1919
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:25,936
That's how I looked at it and...

1920
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:27,455
But thankfully, it has a happy ending.

1921
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:29,773
His knee is now
stronger and better than ever.

1922
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:31,400
He got a great doctor and...

1923
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:32,803
WERNICK: And was back shooting...

1924
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:34,629
REYNOLDS: He was back shooting
our re-shoots, you know.

1925
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:36,572
He was already back doing stunts for that.

1926
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,883
That's actually right here.
That's where he blew his knee out.

1927
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:43,036
It looks like nothing, but yeah.

1928
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:45,831
WERNICK: Such a great guy.
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

for 15 years or so.

1932
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:02,681
REYNOLDS: One would hope not.

1933
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:04,891
WERNICK: Nor is that.

1934
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:07,227
WADE: Teabag!

1935
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:12,649
Bob?

1936
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:16,820
REESE: This always felt
very Deadpool to us that

1937
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:19,173
we could stop right in the middle
of a massive action scene

1938
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:21,867
and have a very personal
connection, moment here.

1939
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:23,702
As ridiculous as it is.

1940
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,080
How are the kids? Good?

1941
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:29,543
And Gail?
She's still fixing that tuna casserole?

1942
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:32,383
So good! But bad for the waistline,
if you know what I'm talking about.

1943
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,967
Oh! (CLEARS THROAT)

1944
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:42,304
Your... On the left.
You are beautiful woman.

1945
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:43,472
That is so sweet.

1946
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,681
Uh...

1947
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:45,891
Thanks.

1948
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:50,312
REESE: You know, when
you're building a cast,

1949
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:53,065
you do try to anticipate the
interaction between characters.

1950
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:56,899
And one of the reasons we chose Colossus
is because he is a goody two-shoes.

1951
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:58,654
- He is a bit of a prude.
- REYNOLDS. Mmm.

1952
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:01,239
REESE: Ah, there's the name...
The name in bodies, which was...

1953
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:02,717
REYNOLDS: One guy with his pants down.

1954
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:05,494
- That's overlooked a lot.
- (REESE CHUCKLES)

1955
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:09,414
But, you know, because Colossus
is such a straight arrow,

1956
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:12,000
it makes him all the more fun
opposite Deadpool,

1957
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:13,669
who is a lunatic.

1958
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:14,992
NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD: Hey!

1959
01:26:15,253 --> 01:26:16,254
Climb on!

1960
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:21,718
WERNICK: He becomes a little bit
of Spider-Man, here.

1961
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:23,905
REYNOLDS: Yeah, it's a little bit...
A little Spider-Man. Yeah.

1962
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:27,683
That jump is a little...
Pushed it a little bit.

1963
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:31,103
REESE: (CHUCKLES)
I love the girlish screams.

1964
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,626
REYNOLDS: (LAUGHS)
Oh, yeah, totally.

1965
01:26:33,772 --> 01:26:35,416
REESE: It's just not enough for him
to scream.

1966
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,793
REYNOLDS: Deadpool is not a manly man.
He's...

1967
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:38,503
REESE: He's got to scream
like a 10-year-old girl.

1968
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:40,153
REYNOLDS: He is part-10-year-old girl.

1969
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:44,491
WERNICK: That was filmed on a, uh...

1970
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,261
- What do they call that? A gimbal.
- REYNOLDS: A gimbal.

1971
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:50,789
REYNOLDS: Yeah. It's a giant sort of
floating platform that

1972
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:54,960
rotates and rocks via remote control.

1973
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:59,589
REESE: Yeah, and then ultimately tilts
which gave us our, you know,

1974
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:02,217
careening flight deck look.

1975
01:27:03,427 --> 01:27:07,389
REYNOLDS: We cut that out but this guy
grabs my leg on the ground and I...

1976
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:12,394
I say, "Your plan to trip me to death
has failed," and then I break his neck.

1977
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:14,146
Crush him.

1978
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:17,065
Wade?

1979
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:18,400
Don't worry, baby...

1980
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:20,485
I'mma get you out of that shit-box.

1981
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:23,186
What better way to crawl back inside
that head of yours?

1982
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,031
Oh, you never left.

1983
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:27,200
But you did, asshole!

1984
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:28,827
Deep breath, darling.

1985
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:31,496
Oh, wait.

1986
01:27:32,622 --> 01:27:34,166
Wrong choice of words.

1987
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:36,293
(CHOKING)

1988
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:39,129
I hope they blocked pain
to your every last nerve.

1989
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:40,380
"Cause I'mma go lookin'!

1990
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:43,842
I hear you grow back body parts now,
Wade.

1991
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:45,343
When I'm finished...

1992
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:47,179
parts will have to grow back you.

1993
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:48,472
Good one.

1994
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:51,016
Yep, that was a good one.

1995
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:52,100
Let's dance.

1996
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:54,495
REYNOLDS: I think that was like an
impromptu fourth wall break.

1997
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:57,564
I don't know if that was ever meant
lo be a fourth wall break until we...

1998
01:27:57,647 --> 01:27:59,399
WERNICK: And makes me laugh.
And again...

1999
01:27:59,483 --> 01:28:00,523
REYNOLDS: ...did it there.

2000
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:02,003
WERNICK: Another one I say
around the house.

2001
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:03,570
REYNOLDS: Yeah, it's a good one.

2002
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:06,782
REESE: We call Ryan "The Elevator".

2003
01:28:06,865 --> 01:28:09,868
Because he elevates
every single thing he's in.

2004
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:11,012
REYNOLDS: Now, you're just
being sweet to me.

2005
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:12,120
REESE: No, I...

2006
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:15,832
REYNOLDS: Come on, now.
REESE: No, I'm serious. You don't...

2007
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:17,685
REYNOLDS: We worked...
I'll say that we all...

2008
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:20,128
Us three work together
very, very, very well.

2009
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:25,383
And I hope we get to work together until
we're all very, very old and grayer.

2010
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:27,069
- Both Rhett and I are already...
- (REESE CHUCKLES)

2011
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:28,196
...getting gray whereas Paul...

2012
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,139
WERNICK: Oh, come on.
I'm just gray as can be.

2013
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:32,867
-REESE: (MOCKING) Dye job. Dye job.
(WERNICK CHUCKLES)

2014
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:35,018
REYNOLDS: Totally, 100%.

2015
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:39,022
(GROANS)

2016
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:42,943
(CHOKING)

2017
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,987
WERNICK: The music
that's about to kick in here was, uh,

2018
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:47,823
originally John Denver.

2019
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:50,325
REYNOLDS: Sure was, wasn't it?

2020
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:52,953
WERNICK: Rhett was a massive
John Denver fan.

2021
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:54,305
REYNOLDS: I do love the John Denver song.

2022
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:56,557
WERNICK: Or is a massive John Denver fan.
REESE: Of course.

2023
01:28:56,581 --> 01:28:57,767
- Still am.
- WERNICK: Still is.

2024
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:00,686
REYNOLDS: It's one of the few times that
we've had to change music for the film

2025
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:03,046
that I thought we actually improved on.

2026
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:06,424
REESE: And Chicago took its place.
I'm also a huge Chicago fan.

2027
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:08,176
So it felt like a lateral move to me.

2028
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:09,678
But it's...

2029
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:12,764
- WERNICK: Rhett's an easy listener.
- (ALL LAUGHING)

2030
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:14,608
REYNOLDS: But how
hard it is... It was hard.

2031
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:18,019
It's hard to pick the music for Deadpool
because it has to be ironic.

2032
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:21,606
But it still has to be good
and emotional and it's...

2033
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:24,693
So you're not really picking songs that,
you know, are, sort of,

2034
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:26,319
one-hit-wonder, sucky songs.

2035
01:29:26,403 --> 01:29:30,699
You're picking songs that are slightly
legendary but also slightly ironic.

2036
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:32,659
- So it's got a weird tone.
- WERNICK: Yeah.

2037
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:35,161
REYNOLDS: It's always tough,
picking the songs.

2038
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:44,129
REESE: Yeah, but also easy to pick
the songs, in a way, too.

2039
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:45,380
Because it's so freeing.

2040
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:46,899
- You can think of any genre...
- REYNOLDS: True.

2041
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:47,942
...If it works for the moment.

2042
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:49,151
REYNOLDS: But when you hear one
that works,

2043
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:51,344
- you know it works right away.
- REESE: That's true.

2044
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:54,228
REYNOLDS: Whereas we always knew
right away if something wouldn't work.

2045
01:29:54,306 --> 01:29:55,950
WERNICK: Tim had this idea of putting these

2046
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:58,602
- animated cartoon characters.
- REYNOLDS: Cartoon.

2047
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:03,481
WERNICK: And really bizarre and fucked up
but awesome at the same time.

2048
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:06,276
REYNOLDS: Yeah.
WERNICK: In this particular scene.

2049
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:13,509
- (REYNOLDS HUMMING)
- WERNICK: Again, here's our love story

2050
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:15,410
and then undercut with...

2051
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:17,329
(REYNOLDS LAUGHING)

2052
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:21,416
Oh, I always enjoy that moment.

2053
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:26,022
This is a great example of sound mixing
you're gonna see here

2054
01:30:26,046 --> 01:30:28,965
where they just pump the song up

2055
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,509
right when we need it.

2056
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:34,262
You'll hear it, just gonna... Pop.

2057
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:38,659
WERNICK: You know,
Just the little visual effect

2058
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:40,435
of the blood popping out there.

2059
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:43,355
- Tim is such a VFX maestro, you know.
- REYNOLDS: Yeah.

2060
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:46,858
WERNICK: He owns a VFX company
here in Los Angeles.

2061
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:49,611
And it's just really how he got his start.

2062
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:51,446
And is just brilliant at it and, you know,

2063
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,573
you can see it in this entire third act.

2064
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:56,993
REYNOLDS: Weirdly you can't do that
little thing in a PG-13 movie.

2065
01:30:57,077 --> 01:31:00,205
That's, I mean... That's just one of the
billion things that we were able to do

2066
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:03,416
with this movie as a rated-R film
that we couldn't have done otherwise.

2067
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:06,920
REESE: Yeah, we really do owe thanks
to Jim Gianopulos and Stacey Snider

2068
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:10,173
and Emma Watts for allowing us
to do this R.

2069
01:31:10,256 --> 01:31:12,842
There's obviously a glass ceiling
on box-office grosses.

2070
01:31:12,926 --> 01:31:17,138
You make a lot less with an R-rated movie
than you do with a PG-13 movie.

2071
01:31:17,222 --> 01:31:20,684
And they were willing to
sacrifice those hard dollars

2072
01:31:20,767 --> 01:31:23,061
for this crazy, creative experience.

2073
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:25,230
And we should really thank them for that.

2074
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:26,666
REYNOLDS: Yeah, and we also, you know...

2075
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:30,110
I personally throw them
under the bus all the time

2076
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:33,655
as a joke in the media when
we're talking about Deadpool, but...

2077
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:38,660
The real story is that they were 100%
supportive of this film being an R-rated film

2078
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:42,497
and 100% supportive of sacrificing,

2079
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:45,500
like you said,
that huge amount of money

2080
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:50,088
to deliver an authentic Deadpool
that the fans deserve so...

2081
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:56,678
WERNICK: You know that this movie
is many things and, uh...

2082
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:01,474
It's an apple amongst oranges.

2083
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:04,686
You know, there's an oversaturation of
superhero movies out there.

2084
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:07,355
And this is unlike all of them.

2085
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:11,276
Because it is R and
it does break all the rules.

2086
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:15,881
REYNOLDS: We were lucky, though,
you know, we...

2087
01:32:15,905 --> 01:32:18,186
This movie could've been made
Six years ago and I don't...

2088
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:21,286
I don't know that it would be as
effective just given the fact that

2089
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:25,457
we were in a climate of just extraordinary
saturation of superhero movies.

2090
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,625
And we're at that intersection where

2091
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:28,989
it's kind of, you know, ready...

2092
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:31,212
We're ready for something
a little bit different.

2093
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:33,798
Big Styrofoam...

2094
01:32:36,092 --> 01:32:37,135
...Stone.

2097
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:52,984
REYNOLDS: That torture device has
a five-star safely rating, as you can see,

2098
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:56,237
her surviving that fall.

2099
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:59,449
REESE: Yeah, that would never
protect someone in real life.

2101
01:33:01,284 --> 01:33:03,119
REYNOLDS: Yes, it is.

2102
01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:08,333

2103

(GRUNTING)

2104
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:16,716
REYNOLDS: I did not perform this stunt.

2105
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,301
I would like everyone to know.

2106
01:33:19,302 --> 01:33:20,303
WERNICK: Oh!

2107
01:33:20,386 --> 01:33:22,222
REYNOLDS: But Adrian did.

2108
01:33:22,305 --> 01:33:24,224
My stunt... One of my stunt doubles.

2109
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:26,476
Ably.

2110
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:29,020
I did this, though. I do enjoy punching.

2111
01:33:29,312 --> 01:33:30,605
WERNICK: Snap.

2112
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:32,857
And snap.

2113
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:34,317
REYNOLDS: Oh, yeah.

2114
01:33:35,735 --> 01:33:37,028
(EXHALING HEAVILY)

2115
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:40,949
There are no words!

2116
01:33:41,991 --> 01:33:45,620
Me and you are headed
to fix this butterface.

2117
01:33:46,371 --> 01:33:47,372
What?

2118
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:49,040
(CHUCKLES)

2119
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,168
REESE: Not as uncomfortable as it looks.

2120
01:33:52,252 --> 01:33:55,505
- This is an entirely foam set.
- REYNOLDS: Yeah.

2121
01:33:55,588 --> 01:33:58,508
REESE: You can practically jump
up and down on it like a bed.

2122
01:33:58,591 --> 01:34:00,760
REYNOLDS: Yeah, it was sort of fun.

2123
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:03,680
In a weird way... It's like one of those...

2124
01:34:04,222 --> 01:34:07,725
Gyms that's like for kids where
you get to just run around

2125
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:10,728
and jump on anything.

2126
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:16,526
So, you mean to say...

2127
01:34:17,318 --> 01:34:21,573
after all this, you can't fix me?

2128
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:25,099
REYNOLDS: I love the... Colossus has
a speech coming up about

2129
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:27,120
four or five moments that define a hero.

2130
01:34:27,203 --> 01:34:29,747
And this is something that
Rhett and Paul wrote that I...

2131
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:32,393
It's one of the great things about this,
I think, about this sequence,

2132
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:33,835
which is that it really resonates.

2133
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:37,046
It's actually... Could work very well
in any kind of superhero movie

2134
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:40,967
<i>and stand on its own as a dramatic
and beautiful, moving speech.</i>

2135
01:34:41,426 --> 01:34:44,846
Which of course we undercut
with extraordinary violence.

2136
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:47,517
REESE: Yeah, we worked
on the timing quite a bit.

2137
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:50,810
We didn't want the audience to
get ahead of the gunshot

2138
01:34:50,894 --> 01:34:51,936
and expect it coming.

2139
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:54,248
But we kind of wanted them
to get ahead of it just a touch.

2140
01:34:54,272 --> 01:34:55,332
So they were wincing, going,

2141
01:34:55,356 --> 01:34:57,233
"You don't think he's about to possibly..."

2142
01:34:57,317 --> 01:34:59,694
WERNICK: And seeing it
with an audience, they do...

2143
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:02,614
- You can see them anticipating the shot...
- (REYNOLDS LAUGHS)

2144
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:05,408
...and still waiting for it
and wanting it.

2145
01:35:05,491 --> 01:35:06,760
REYNOLDS: They start
tittering, you know about...

2146
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:08,119
WERNICK: Yeah.

2147
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:12,332
Moments when you're offered a choice.

2148
01:35:12,498 --> 01:35:16,669
To make a sacrifice, conquer a flaw,
save a friend...

2149
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:22,926
REYNOLDS: Right about here, they start to
sort of figure it out.

2150
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:27,096
WERNICK: What Colossus is, what, about...

2151
01:35:27,305 --> 01:35:30,141
What was it? $50,000 a sec?

2152
01:35:30,225 --> 01:35:32,244
- (STAMMERS) What was it?
- REYNOLDS: Oh. It was something cray.

2153
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:36,898
I was like... So much of our budget
went to creating Colossus.

2154
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:40,068
- But worth every penny of it.
- WERNICK: Every penny.

2155
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:44,656
But at least fuckface won't heal from that.

2156
01:35:44,906 --> 01:35:47,533
If wearing superhero tights...

2157
01:35:47,992 --> 01:35:49,327
means sparing psychopaths...

2158
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:51,537
then maybe I wasn't meant to wear 'em.

2159
01:35:51,704 --> 01:35:54,040
Not everyone monitors a hall like you.

2160
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:55,250
Just promise...

2161
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:59,045
Yeah, yeah, I'll be on the lookout
for the next four moments.

2162
01:35:59,212 --> 01:36:00,713
Oh, shit.

2163
01:36:00,797 --> 01:36:04,759
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm just a boy...

2164
01:36:04,842 --> 01:36:07,387
REESE: What movie is that from?
What movie are we referencing?

2165
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:08,989
REYNOLDS: Like Notting Hill?
WERNICK: That is...

2166
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:10,932
REESE: Maybe Notting Hill.
WERNICK: It's a...

2167
01:36:11,057 --> 01:36:14,185
REYNOLDS: I think it's Notting Hill.
WERNICK: Notting Hill or the other one.

2168
01:36:14,269 --> 01:36:16,020
REYNOLDS: It's Julia Roberts I thought of.

2169
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:17,105
I'm just a girl...

2170
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:19,607
- REESE: I think it is.
- "...standing in front of a boy."

2171
01:36:20,066 --> 01:36:21,859
Start talking!

2172
01:36:23,903 --> 01:36:25,488
I'm sorry.

2173
01:36:25,738 --> 01:36:27,198
I'm so sorry.

2174
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:30,576
For everything,
I'm sorry for leaving...

2175
01:36:32,078 --> 01:36:34,038
I'm sorry for not cowboying up sooner.

2176
01:36:35,707 --> 01:36:37,458
WERNICK: I just love this scene so much.

2177
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:40,253
It's just... Ryan and Morena just act

2178
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:42,898
- the fuck out of this scene right here.
- REYNOLDS: She's so great. Ugh!

2179
01:36:42,922 --> 01:36:45,341
REESE: Every now and then you can
catch the dated references.

2180
01:36:45,425 --> 01:36:48,553
The "Cowboying up" was in reference
to the Boston Red Sox

2181
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:51,240
- cowboying up against the Yankees.
- REYNOLDS: I didn't know that. Really?

2182
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:52,658
REESE: Yeah, many
years ago and it's just...

2183
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:56,102
You just go, "Oh, yeah, we really
did write this script a long time ago."

2184
01:36:56,185 --> 01:36:58,831
WERNICK: But again, we're back to the
beating heart of the movie, you know.

2185
01:36:58,855 --> 01:37:03,693
The love story between
these two broken souls, you know.

2186
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:08,477
REYNOLDS: I do like this sequence.
WERNICK: And the look.

2187
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:10,592
REYNOLDS: Not sure everybody understood
that it was a call back

2188
01:37:10,616 --> 01:37:13,244
to their first meeting but...

2189
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:14,888
REESE.: It seems like they catch on.

2190
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:16,140
REYNOLDS: Talking about
the dire circumstances.

2191
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:17,349
REESE: They catch on as the scene goes.

2192
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:20,835
For a little bit there,
they don't quite get what's going on.

2193
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:23,588
I should have come and found you sooner.

2194
01:37:25,048 --> 01:37:29,010
But, baby, the guy under this mask,
he ain't the same one that you remember.

2195
01:37:33,389 --> 01:37:34,599
You mean this mask?

2196
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:38,686
REESE: Yeah, and we always thought that

2197
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:41,731
the Hugh Jackman mask
under the other mask.

2198
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:45,318
But again, once again
undercut emotion with comedy

2199
01:37:45,485 --> 01:37:47,320
and hopefully, you know...

2200
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:49,947
REYNOLDS: That was
a fun phone call to Hugh.

2201
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:52,426

2205
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:01,377

of a cheat here because

2206
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:03,127
that was supposed to be...

2207
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:04,670
If you do the math right,

2208
01:38:04,754 --> 01:38:08,633
that was supposed to be cut out
from the People magazine.

2209
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,135
- Yeah, sexiest man but...
- REESE: But it's too big.

2210
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:13,572
- ...It's too big, obviously.
- REYNOLDS: Couldn't fit my giant head

2211
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:15,139
is what you're really trying to say.

2212
01:38:15,223 --> 01:38:17,392

- REYNOLDS: It did, it did. It never changed.

2227
01:39:02,228 --> 01:39:05,565
That's probably why the movie
wasn't made for six years.

2228
01:39:05,648 --> 01:39:07,066
WERNICK: (LAUGHING) That line.

2229
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:08,151
Super-penis.

2230
01:39:08,568 --> 01:39:10,445
COLOSSUS: Come on, Wade. Language.

2231
01:39:10,695 --> 01:39:12,071
Young one is present.

2232
01:39:13,156 --> 01:39:14,866
What are you still doing?

2233
01:39:15,074 --> 01:39:17,660
Get out of here.
Go make yourself useful!

2234
01:39:17,827 --> 01:39:20,496
You, go be a really big brother
to someone.

2235
01:39:20,663 --> 01:39:22,290
Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn.

2236
01:39:22,707 --> 01:39:26,294
WERNICK: The Beast shitting on my lawn
was gonna be a coda that we...

2237
01:39:26,377 --> 01:39:29,755
REESE: Yeah, Paul wrote the
funniest coda ever where the Beast...

2238
01:39:29,839 --> 01:39:31,549
Deadpool literally catches Beast

2239
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:32,633
shitting on his lawn.

2240
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:34,236
REYNOLDS: Let people know
what a coda is first.

2241
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:35,636
Don't know
if everyone knows that.

2242
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,239
<i>REESE. Yes, that's the scene
at the very end,</i>

2243
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:39,098
after the credits.

2244
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:42,852
And Paul just had this zany idea of what if

2245
01:39:42,935 --> 01:39:45,146
we actually catch Beast

2246
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:46,707
- shitting on Deadpool's lawn...
- REYNOLDS: (LAUGHING)

2247
01:39:46,731 --> 01:39:48,566
...and running off
and Deadpool chasing him,

2248
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:50,485
angrily holding his morning newspaper.

2249
01:39:50,568 --> 01:39:52,880
- And it was so funny.
- REYNOLDS: Nicholas Hoult was game.

2250
01:39:52,904 --> 01:39:53,905
He was game, he loved it.

2251
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:55,174
WERNICK: Yeah, we just couldn't
make the schedule work.

2252
01:39:55,198 --> 01:39:56,199
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

2253
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:02,830
Come here.

2254
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:06,250
REYNOLDS: Poor Morena had to...
(LAUGHS)

2255
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:08,794
Not looking my best right there.

2256
01:40:08,878 --> 01:40:10,421
(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

2257
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:16,802
WERNICK: Again a plant
that then paid off here.

2258
01:40:16,928 --> 01:40:19,388
REYNOLDS: Another song
that really stayed in this

2259
01:40:19,472 --> 01:40:22,112
- script from the beginning, I think, right?
- WERNICK: Yeah. Yeah.

2260
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:28,564
REYNOLDS: Thank you, George Michael,
for letting us use this.

2261
01:40:28,648 --> 01:40:30,000
WERNICK: And Ridgeley,
don't forget about Ridgeley.

2262
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:31,627
REYNOLDS: And Ridgeley, of course,
of course, of course,

2263
01:40:31,651 --> 01:40:33,653
you can't forget about him.

2264
01:40:33,736 --> 01:40:36,447
WADE: The right girl will bring out
the hero in you.

2265
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:40,284
Now, let's finish this epic wide shot.
Pull out.

2266
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:41,953
There we go, that looks nice.

2267
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:44,515
That's gonna be about the only thing
that's pulling out tonight.

2268
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:47,792
Who doesn't love a happy ending, huh?

2269
01:40:47,959 --> 01:40:51,629
Till next time, this is your friendly
neighborhood pool guy singing...

2270
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:53,714
(SINGING) I'm never gonna dance again

2271
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:57,301
REYNOLDS: (SINGING) The way I dance
with you, oh!

2272
01:40:57,927 --> 01:41:00,805
Wow! That was like 24 walls right there.

2273
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:02,807
- Me singing...
- REESE: Oh, my gosh.

2274
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:05,410
...while the movie was singing
while George Michael was singing.

2275
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:10,231
<i>Yes, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick indeed.</i>

2276
01:41:11,482 --> 01:41:12,817
(REYNOLDS SINGING)

2277
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:16,320
REESE: This is
a beautiful little animated sequence.

2278
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:17,738
REYNOLDS: I know.

2279
01:41:18,781 --> 01:41:19,925
This was kind of a late addition, too.

2280
01:41:19,949 --> 01:41:22,076
- Really happy with it.
- REESE: It was.

2281
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:25,413
I can't remember. Tim hired
Just this brilliant guy to do It.

2282
01:41:25,496 --> 01:41:26,747
And I'm spacing his name.

2283
01:41:26,831 --> 01:41:29,631
WERNICK: The same guys who did the...
REYNOLDS: Who did the cartoons...

2284
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:30,727
WERNICK: The cartoons
in the stab scene, yeah.

2285
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:31,752
REESE: Right.

2286
01:41:31,836 --> 01:41:34,196
- The little heart with the arms and legs.
- REYNOLDS: Yeah.

2287
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:41,804
Also known as Junkie XL.
Great... Great guy.

2288
01:41:43,306 --> 01:41:48,144
WERNICK: Just a brilliant group of people
who came together to make this

2289
01:41:48,227 --> 01:41:51,188
and a bunch of great guys
on top of it and women and...

2290
01:41:52,023 --> 01:41:53,441
And men, children...

2291
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:55,610
REESE: Yeah, and we also really...

2292
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:57,004
REYNOLDS: Do you really have
to talk about children

2293
01:41:57,028 --> 01:41:58,839
- while an animated boner is on the screen?
- (REESE LAUGHS)

2294
01:41:58,863 --> 01:42:00,281
WERNICK: Yeah.

2295
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:03,242
REESE: Collectively stood on
all the giants' shoulders

2296
01:42:03,367 --> 01:42:07,163
who created Deadpool, Rob Liefeld
and all the wonderful writers who...

2297
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:10,333
And artists who brought Deadpool to life
for so many years

2298
01:42:10,416 --> 01:42:12,436
- before he became a movie. Yeah.
- WERNICK: Fabian.

2299
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:15,630
REYNOLDS: Fabian, yeah,
Just all these guys, yeah.

2300
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:30,269
(LAUGHING)

2301
01:42:30,811 --> 01:42:33,022
I love that little sequence.

2302
01:42:35,775 --> 01:42:36,901
WERNICK: Salt-n-Pepa.

2303
01:42:39,654 --> 01:42:42,490
REYNOLDS: That was another song
that reflect... We had, in the movie,

2304
01:42:42,573 --> 01:42:43,824
initially, in every place that

2305
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:47,411
Shoop is in and it was just too
damn expensive, so we ended up

2306
01:42:47,495 --> 01:42:49,375
with Shoop, but in a weird way
Shoop was better.

2307
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:50,998
It works so much better and...

2308
01:42:51,624 --> 01:42:53,644
- WERNICK: Yeah.
- ...it worked with the tone of the movie

2309
01:42:53,668 --> 01:42:55,086
in a great way.

2310
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:03,945
REYNOLDS: Here is where you'll get to see
if I was Bandhu or not...

2311
01:43:03,969 --> 01:43:06,931
- WERNICK: Oh, yeah.
- ...In the credits. I don't think I was, though.

2312
01:43:07,848 --> 01:43:11,185
Nope. Hmm. Oh, well...

2313
01:43:11,268 --> 01:43:12,937
REESE: So Bandhu is not even listed.

2314
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:15,022
REYNOLDS: I'm uncredited, yeah.

2315
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:19,527
WERNICK: Get me Ryan's agent
on line two, please.

2316
01:43:19,777 --> 01:43:21,696
REYNOLDS: You have two lines?
WERNICK: I do.

2317
01:43:21,779 --> 01:43:22,923
WERNICK: The first line
doesn't work, though...

2318
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:23,989
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

2319
01:43:24,073 --> 01:43:25,759
REESE: Here in Ryan's house,
you have two lines?

2320
01:43:25,783 --> 01:43:27,993
- This is getting weird.
- REYNOLDS: Super weird.

2321
01:43:28,411 --> 01:43:32,790
WERNICK: I've been living in the crawlspace
for the last little bit here.

2322
01:43:32,873 --> 01:43:33,874
REYNOLDS: Oh.

2323
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:36,311
- Joan Bierman, our post-supervisor that...
- WERNICK: Great.

2324
01:43:36,335 --> 01:43:38,921
REYNOLDS: There are so many people that
work on these movies that

2325
01:43:39,004 --> 01:43:43,467
are never front and center, but just
they work so goddamn hard.

2326
01:43:43,634 --> 01:43:45,803
And Joan is one of them. Joan just...

2327
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:51,392
Day in and day out, just gave this movie
her last drop of blood in post.

2328
01:43:51,475 --> 01:43:53,394
It was an accelerated post on this film

2329
01:43:53,477 --> 01:43:57,148
because Fox gave us very little time
between shooting and our release date

2330
01:43:57,481 --> 01:44:00,985
to get this movie completely finished and
ready for its audience and...

2331
01:44:01,485 --> 01:44:04,989
And a key component to that success
is Joan Bierman.

2332
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:07,908
WERNICK: We started shooting in March of

2333
01:44:08,409 --> 01:44:11,495
- 2015?
- REYNOLDS: Not true, April.

2334
01:44:11,662 --> 01:44:15,833
Because we'd already... Remember we
shot the April Fools' gag with Mario Lopez

2335
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:18,502
and then started shooting which was...

2336
01:44:18,961 --> 01:44:20,564
WERNICK: Is that right? Yeah, you're right.

2337
01:44:20,588 --> 01:44:22,315
REYNOLDS: I think it was like April 4
we started shooting.

2338
01:44:22,339 --> 01:44:23,340
REESE: Wow.

2339
01:44:23,424 --> 01:44:26,886
WERNICK: Yeah, and you know it came
out in, or it's coming out in February.

2340
01:44:26,969 --> 01:44:29,096
So that's a what? A 10-month turnaround?

2341
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:30,181
REYNOLDS: Yeah.

2342
01:44:30,264 --> 01:44:31,533
WERNICK: And with
all the visual effects and...

2343
01:44:31,557 --> 01:44:34,351
- Just amazing.
- REYNOLDS: Really tough.

2344
01:44:34,477 --> 01:44:37,980
Tough, tough deadline to meet but...

2345
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:41,692
What's that great expression that the task
expands for the time allotted,

2346
01:44:41,776 --> 01:44:43,462
- or something like that?
- REESE: Yeah, exactly.

2347
01:44:43,486 --> 01:44:45,529
REYNOLDS: It seems to be
about right for this, yeah.

2348
01:44:46,113 --> 01:44:49,784
WERNICK: And we're actually
nine days away

2349
01:44:49,867 --> 01:44:52,244
from the movie actually releasing.

2350
01:44:52,328 --> 01:44:55,122
REYNOLDS: Yeah, as we record this,
we're nine days out.

2351
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:57,500
REESE: So we have no idea whether
this has a happy ending.

2352
01:44:57,625 --> 01:44:58,769
REYNOLDS: (LAUGHING) Yeah, that's true.

2353
01:44:58,793 --> 01:45:01,337
REESE: We know whether this session's
gonna have a happy ending.

2354
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:03,881
WERNICK: What? What?
REYNOLDS: Absolutely.

2355
01:45:04,548 --> 01:45:06,550
I got two hands, one for each of you.

2356
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:09,804
WERNICK: "I bet it
feels huge in this hand."

2357
01:45:09,887 --> 01:45:10,930
(REESE AND REYNOLDS LAUGH)

2358
01:45:11,013 --> 01:45:13,724
REESE: There's a general
misconception that,

2359
01:45:13,808 --> 01:45:15,702
well, I don't know how
much of a misconception it is,

2360
01:45:15,726 --> 01:45:17,853
that everybody in Hollywood's out just

2361
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:20,648
lying on the beach and
we're all doing cocaine

2362
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:23,150
and yeah, yeah, maybe those things
happen now and again.

2363
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:25,319
But what's really happening is

2364
01:45:25,402 --> 01:45:27,238
everybody is working their butt off.

2365
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:28,405
Like these are...

2366
01:45:28,489 --> 01:45:30,991
When you watch a movie like this and
you watch these names

2367
01:45:31,075 --> 01:45:35,579
Just drift past, these are people
who worked 18, 19-hour days often,

2368
01:45:35,663 --> 01:45:37,122
back to back to back to back,

2369
01:45:37,331 --> 01:45:38,791
to bring this to life so

2370
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:41,335
I'm just gonna stand up
for the people of Hollywood.

2371
01:45:41,502 --> 01:45:44,171
And remind everybody how hard they work

2372
01:45:44,463 --> 01:45:46,882
to make this magic happen.

2373
01:45:47,675 --> 01:45:49,945
REYNOLDS: Absolutely, and in a lot of
different cities, too,

2374
01:45:49,969 --> 01:45:52,972
not just Los Angeles
but all over the country

2375
01:45:53,055 --> 01:45:55,655
- and all over the world, frankly. Yeah.
- REESE: Yeah, Vancouver.

2376
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:59,311
And our VFX
was done all over the place.

2377
01:45:59,562 --> 01:46:02,940
It's just, you know, when you're a citizen

2378
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:05,669
and these movies come out in theaters,
you think they just come out.

2379
01:46:05,693 --> 01:46:08,153
And you don't realize the
many, many years of labor.

2380
01:46:08,237 --> 01:46:09,238
REYNOLDS: No.

2381
01:46:14,034 --> 01:46:15,411
And all those people put their...

2382
01:46:15,494 --> 01:46:18,080
Put their blood, sweat and tears
into the ones that work.

2383
01:46:18,163 --> 01:46:20,976
<i>And they put the same blood, the
same sweat, the same tears into the ones</i>

2384
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,352
- that don't work.
- REESE: Like this one.

2385
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:24,253
- I'm kidding.
- REYNOLDS: (LAUGHS) Wow!

2386
01:46:24,336 --> 01:46:27,016
REESE: This one is awesome, we love it.
REYNOLDS: Oh, we do love it.

2387
01:46:29,967 --> 01:46:33,262
I quite literally miss shooting

2388
01:46:33,804 --> 01:46:34,805
this film. (CHUCKLES)

2389
01:46:35,764 --> 01:46:39,435
And a special thanks, with tongue,
to Rob Liefeld and Fabian.

2390
01:46:45,941 --> 01:46:47,610
WERNICK: Did they break the...

2391
01:46:47,693 --> 01:46:49,361
The two codas here?

2392
01:46:49,445 --> 01:46:51,322
Or is it one long coda at the end?

2393
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:53,032
I don't know how we ended up on that.

2394
01:46:53,115 --> 01:46:55,117
REYNOLDS: It's one long one. Yeah.
WERNICK: Is it?

2395
01:46:56,493 --> 01:46:59,788
<i>REYNOLDS: Yeah, this full coda
was never shown to...</i>

2396
01:47:00,039 --> 01:47:02,999
- At the fan screenings or test audiences.
- WERNICK: Test audiences, yeah.

2397
01:47:04,293 --> 01:47:06,462
REESE: Whose idea was
the Ferris Bueller thing?

2398
01:47:06,587 --> 01:47:09,423
REYNOLDS: I don't remember.

2399
01:47:10,841 --> 01:47:12,110
I thought it was one of you guys.

2400
01:47:12,134 --> 01:47:14,011
WERNICK: Yeah, I think that was me.

2401
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:15,697
REESE: Yeah, I think
that was you, wasn't it?

2402
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:17,348
I couldn't remember.

2403
01:47:17,431 --> 01:47:20,517
Expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2.
Well, we don't have that kind of money.

2404
01:47:21,894 --> 01:47:24,772
What are you expecting?
Sam Jackson to show up?

2405
01:47:24,855 --> 01:47:26,565
With an eye patch and a...

2406
01:47:26,649 --> 01:47:29,568
WERNICK: They made us change
the wallpaper, Paramount Pictures.

2407
01:47:29,693 --> 01:47:31,362
REYNOLDS: 'Cause it was too damn close...

2408
01:47:31,487 --> 01:47:32,863
Maybe it is broken up...

2409
01:47:32,947 --> 01:47:37,034
'Cause it was too damn close to the
original Ferris Bueller wallpaper.

2410
01:47:37,117 --> 01:47:40,371
WERNICK: So I think Tim put in
some penises onto the wallpaper.

2411
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:41,723
REYNOLDS: Yes.
WERNICK: If you look closely...

2412
01:47:41,747 --> 01:47:43,058
REYNOLDS: There are penises
in the wallpaper.

2413
01:47:43,082 --> 01:47:45,918
WERNICK: I'm not kidding.
REYNOLDS: No, there are, yeah.

2414
01:47:46,001 --> 01:47:47,711
REESE: I don't see any.

2415
01:47:48,629 --> 01:47:50,965
- REYNOLDS: You wouldn't!
- (ALL CHUCKLING)

2416
01:47:52,091 --> 01:47:53,384
Anyway, big secret. Shh.

2417
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:56,762
And don't leave your garbage all lying
around. It's a total...

2418
01:47:56,845 --> 01:47:58,889
WERNICK: That was a nod
to Tim Miller who hates

2419
01:47:58,973 --> 01:48:01,141
people who leave their garbage
at movie theaters.

2420
01:48:01,225 --> 01:48:02,893
I am among them.

2421
01:48:02,977 --> 01:48:04,061
