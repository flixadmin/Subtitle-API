1
00:01:04,823 --> 00:01:08,142
Port of San Fransokyo.

2
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:18,059
The winner!
By total annihilation.

3
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:19,866
Yama!

4
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:23,094
Who's next?
Where's the guts to stop me in the ring?

5
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:24,792
With little Yama!

6
00:02:26,575 --> 00:02:28,671
Can I try?

7
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:33,529
I have a robot.
I built it myself.

8
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:44,183
Beat it kid!
House rules: You gotta pay to play.

9
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,850
Oh, is this enough?

10
00:02:46,863 --> 00:02:49,852
What's your name, little boy?

11
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:52,625
Hiro?
Hiro Hamada.

12
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,690
Prepare your bot, Zero...

13
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:12,106
Two bots enter...
One might lives.

14
00:03:12,132 --> 00:03:14,034
Fighters ready?

15
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:15,811
Fight!

16
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:29,400
That was my first fight.
Can I try again?

17
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:33,191
No one likes a sore loser little boy.

18
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:34,374
Go home.

19
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:36,367
I've got more money...

20
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,476
Fighters ready?

21
00:03:43,551 --> 00:03:44,949
Fight!

22
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:49,595
Megabot!

23
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:51,283
Destroy.

24
00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:23,749
- No more "Little Yama".
- But what?

25
00:04:23,832 --> 00:04:26,001
This is not possible!

26
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,872
Hey, I'm as surprised as you are.
Beginner's luck.

27
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:31,484
Do you wanna go again?

28
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:32,809
Yama?

29
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:35,336
No one hustles Yama!
Wooh! Hey!

30
00:04:35,787 --> 00:04:37,726
Teach him a lesson!

31
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:40,999
Hey fellas
Let's talk about this.

32
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:46,258
- Hiro, get on!
- Tadashi!

33
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:48,182
Ooh! Good timing.

34
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,803
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

35
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:03,291
- Are you hurt?
- No!

36
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:06,110
Then, what are you thinking, knuckle head!

37
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:12,811
You graduated high school and you're 13
and this is what you're doing?

38
00:05:14,504 --> 00:05:15,967
Hold on!

39
00:05:21,151 --> 00:05:25,076
Bot fighting is illegal.
You're gonna get yourself arrested.

40
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,750
Bot fighting is not illegal. Betting on
bot fighting..that's..that's illegal.

41
00:05:29,778 --> 00:05:32,944
But, so who could heed
I'm on a roll big brother.

42
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:35,316
And there is no stopping me!

43
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:38,333
Oh, no.

44
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:51,233
Hi, Aunt Cass.

45
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:53,472
Are you guys okay?
Tell me you're okay...

46
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:54,816
- We're fine.
- We're okay.

47
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:56,184
Oh Good.

48
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:58,490
Then what were you two
knuckle heads thinking?!

49
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:02,843
For 10 years, I heed the
best I could to raise you.

50
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:06,857
Have I been perfect? No!
Do I know anything about children? No!

51
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:09,867
Should I pick a book on parenting?
Probably?

52
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,286
Where I was going with this?
I had a point...

53
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:14,485
- Sorry.
- We love you, Aunt Cass.

54
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,195
I love you too!

55
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:21,899
I had to close up early because of you
two fellons on beat poetry night.

56
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:26,302
Stress eating because of you!
Come on, Mochi!

57
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:28,887
This is really good!

58
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:34,603
You'd better make this up to Aunt Cass,
before she eats everything in the cafe.

59
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:35,893
For sure!

60
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:37,726
And I hope you learned your lesson,
bone head.

61
00:06:38,142 --> 00:06:38,781
Absolutely!

62
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,129
You're going bot fighting, aren't you?

63
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:45,402
There's a fight across town.
If I book I can still make it.

64
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:50,051
When are you gonna start doing something
with that big brain of yours?

65
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:54,277
What? Go to college like you?
So people can tell me stuff I already know?

66
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:56,034
Unbelievable!

67
00:06:56,178 --> 00:06:58,256
Ahh! What would Mom and Dad say?

68
00:06:58,282 --> 00:07:01,249
I don't know.
They are gone.

69
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:03,666
They died when I was 3, remember?

70
00:07:05,504 --> 00:07:06,984
Hey!

71
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:10,406
- I'll take you.
- Really?

72
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,274
I can't stop you from going,
But I'm not gonna let you go on your own.

73
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:14,722
Sweet!

74
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:19,153
What are we doing at your nerd school?

75
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,883
Bot fights that way!

76
00:07:23,638 --> 00:07:25,182
Gotta grab something.

77
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:28,443
Is this gonna take long?

78
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:30,428
Relax you big baby,
we will be in and out.

79
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:34,079
- Anyway, you've never seen my lab.
- Oh great! I get to see your nerd lab.

80
00:07:34,116 --> 00:07:35,644
Heads up!
Wooh!

81
00:07:53,898 --> 00:07:55,170
Wow...

82
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:57,287
electromag suspension?

83
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:58,605
Hey!

84
00:07:58,703 --> 00:08:00,062
Who are you?

85
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:03,038
Gogo, this is my brother, Hiro.

86
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:08,214
Welcome to the nerd lab.

87
00:08:08,677 --> 00:08:09,935
Yeah...

88
00:08:09,996 --> 00:08:12,830
I've never seen electromag
suspension on a bike before.

89
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,443
Zero resistance
faster bike.

90
00:08:15,477 --> 00:08:17,876
But...
Not fast enough.

91
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:20,861
Yet.

92
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,799
Ohh! Woohh! Do not move!
Behind the line please.

93
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:30,654
Hey, Wasabi.
This is my brother, Hiro.

94
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,759
Hello, Hiro.
Prepare to be amazed.

95
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:36,047
Catch!

96
00:08:39,189 --> 00:08:41,878
- laser induced plasma?
- Oh, yeah!

97
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:44,259
With a little magnetic confinement for ah..

98
00:08:44,517 --> 00:08:45,871
Ultra precision.

99
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:48,617
Wow, how did you find
anything in this mess?

100
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:51,920
I have a system. There is a place for
everything, and everything in its place.

101
00:08:52,002 --> 00:08:53,780
- I need this!
- You can't do that!

102
00:08:53,786 --> 00:08:55,875
This is anarchy!
Society has rules!

103
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:58,854
Excuse me!
Coming through!

104
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,870
Tadashi!

105
00:09:00,938 --> 00:09:04,355
Oh my gosh, you must be Hiro!

106
00:09:04,426 --> 00:09:07,378
I've heard so much about you!

107
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,447
Perfect timing!
Perfect timing!

108
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:14,177
That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.

109
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:17,210
400 pounds of it.

110
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,999
Come here! Come here!
You're gonna love this.

111
00:09:19,011 --> 00:09:20,949
A dash of per chloric acid.

112
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:24,536
A smidge of cobalt,
A hint of Hydrogen Peroxide...

113
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,770
super heated to 500 Kelvin, and...

114
00:09:31,544 --> 00:09:32,814
Tadah!

115
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,116
It's really great, huh?

116
00:09:34,155 --> 00:09:37,379
- So pink.
- Here's the best part.

117
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:40,781
Wooh!

118
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:43,132
I know right!

119
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:45,577
Chemical metal embrittlement!

120
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:47,087
Not bad, Honey Lemon.

121
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:50,162
Honey Lemon?
Gogo? Wasabi?

122
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:54,392
I spilled wasabi on my shirt
one time people. One time!

123
00:09:54,612 --> 00:09:57,112
Fred is the one who comes up
with the nicknames.

124
00:09:57,377 --> 00:09:58,672
Ah... Whose Fred?

125
00:09:58,676 --> 00:10:00,372
This guy right here.

126
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,405
Ah! Ah! Don't be alarmed,
it is just a suit.

127
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:04,367
This is not my real
face and body.

128
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:05,829
The name is Fred.

129
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,608
School mascot by day but by night

130
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:11,446
I'm also a school mascot.

131
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:13,438
So, what's your major?

132
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:18,024
No! No! I'm not a student but I
am a major science enthusiast.

133
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,217
I've been turning to get honey
to develop a formula...

134
00:10:20,238 --> 00:10:23,202
That can turn me into a
fire breathing lizard at will.

135
00:10:23,294 --> 00:10:26,765
- But she says that's not science.
- It's really not.

136
00:10:26,957 --> 00:10:31,920
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray I ask
Wasabi for isn't science, either?

137
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:32,943
Is it?
Nope!

138
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:36,384
Well then, what about invinsible sandwich?
Hiro!

139
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:40,164
Imagine eating a sandwich but,
everybody just thinks you're crazy.

140
00:10:40,176 --> 00:10:40,994
Just stop.

141
00:10:41,022 --> 00:10:42,206
- Laser Eyes?
- What?

142
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:45,071
- Tingly fingers? Never gonna happen!
- Then what about grocery...

143
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:49,332
- So, what are you been working on?
- I'lll show you.

144
00:10:50,456 --> 00:10:51,899
Duct Tape?

145
00:10:52,117 --> 00:10:55,555
I hate to break it to you, Bro.
Already been invented.

146
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,402
Awww! Dude! Awww...

147
00:11:01,734 --> 00:11:04,530
This is what I've been working on.

148
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:33,448
Hello, I am Baymax.
Your personal health care companion.

149
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:37,381
I was alerted to the need for medical
attention when you said:

150
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,536
Awww...

151
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:41,165
A robotic nurse?

152
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:44,832
On a scale of 1 to 10,
How would you rate your pain?

153
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:47,333
Physical, or emotional?

154
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,910
I will scan you now.

155
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:53,033
Scan complete.

156
00:11:53,237 --> 00:11:57,207
You have a slight epidermal
abrasion on your forearm

157
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,830
I suggest an anti-bacterial spray.

158
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,323
Whoa, whoa...
What's in the spray specifically?

159
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,764
The primary ingredient is: "Bacitracin."

160
00:12:05,904 --> 00:12:08,079
That's a bummer, I'm
actually allergic to that.

161
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,300
You're not allergic to Bacitracin.

162
00:12:10,386 --> 00:12:14,145
You do have a mild allergy to:
Peanuts.

163
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:15,516
Not bad.

164
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:18,383
You've done some serious
coding on this thing huh!

165
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,440
Ahah! Programmed to over more
than 10,000 medical procedures.

166
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:25,047
This chip! Is what makes Baymax,
"Baymax."

167
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:28,925
Vinyl?

168
00:12:28,974 --> 00:12:32,178
Yeah, going for a non-threatening
huggable kind of thing.

169
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,962
Looks like a walking marshmallow.
No offense.

170
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:37,737
I am a robot.
I can not be offended.

171
00:12:37,806 --> 00:12:39,934
Hyperspectro Cameras?

172
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:41,184
Yup.

173
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,537
- Titanium skeleton.
- Carbon fiber.

174
00:12:47,543 --> 00:12:49,644
Right.
Even lighter.

175
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:51,994
Killer actuators, where did you get those?

176
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:53,855
Machine them right here...
In house..

177
00:12:53,912 --> 00:12:55,153
- Really?
- Yup.

178
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:58,179
- He can lift a thousand pounds.
- Shut up!

179
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:01,909
You have been a good boy,
have a lollipop.

180
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:03,124
Nice!

181
00:13:03,488 --> 00:13:05,822
I can not deactivate until you say:

182
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:07,794
You are satisfied with your care.

183
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:10,271
Well then, I'm satisfied with my care.

184
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,530
He's gonna help a lot of people.

185
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:18,040
- Hey, what kind of battery does it use?
- Lithium lon.

186
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:21,391
You know, Super Capacitor
would charge way faster.

187
00:13:22,195 --> 00:13:24,479
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Hamada?

188
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:27,509
Hey, Professor, I actually
was finishing up.

189
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,339
You must be Hiro.
Bot fighter, right?

190
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:34,274
When my daughter was younger,
That's all she wanted to do.

191
00:13:34,343 --> 00:13:35,591
May I?

192
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:37,137
Sure!

193
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:38,402
- Hmm!

194
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:40,058
Magnetic Bearing Servos.

195
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:43,074
Pretty sick huh?
Wanna see how I put them together?

196
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:46,523
Hey, genius!
He invented them!

197
00:13:46,768 --> 00:13:49,089
You are Robert Callaghan?

198
00:13:49,111 --> 00:13:52,832
Like as in, Callaghan cat most blind man.

199
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:54,513
Callaghan, laws of robotics?

200
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,458
That's right.

201
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:58,988
Ever think about applying here?
Your age wouldn't be an issue.

202
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:02,632
I don't know, he's pretty serious
about his career in bot fighting.

203
00:14:02,702 --> 00:14:05,878
- Well, kind of serious.
- I can see why.

204
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,334
With your bot
winning must come easy.

205
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,221
Yeah, I guess.

206
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,919
Well, if you like things easy,
then my program isn't for you.

207
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:17,252
We push the boundaries of robotics here.

208
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:19,853
My students go on to shape the future.

209
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:23,559
Nice to meet you, Hiro.
Good luck with the bot fights.

210
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,741
You gotta hurry if you wanna
catch that bot fight.

211
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:31,189
I have to go here!

212
00:14:31,212 --> 00:14:34,392
If I don't go to this nerd school.
I'm gonna lose my mind.

213
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,083
How do I get in?

214
00:14:39,182 --> 00:14:41,234
Every year, the school has
a student showcase.

215
00:14:41,908 --> 00:14:44,888
You come up with something that blows
Callaghan away. You're in.

216
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:47,370
But, its gotta be great.

217
00:14:49,953 --> 00:14:51,703
Trust me...

218
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,783
It will be...

219
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:04,905
Nothing!
No ideas.

220
00:15:04,953 --> 00:15:07,163
Useless empty brain.

221
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:08,473
Wow...

222
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,527
washed up at 14.

223
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:11,541
So sad.

224
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:14,530
I got nothing! Im done!
I'm never getting in!

225
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:15,713
Hey...

226
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,505
I'm not giving up on you.

227
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:21,992
- What are you doing?
- Shake things up.

228
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:24,627
Use that big brain of yours
to think your way out.

229
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,257
What?

230
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,570
Look for a new angle.

231
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:27,764
Ahhhh...

232
00:16:07,756 --> 00:16:11,794
Wow, a lot of sweet tech here today.
How you feelin?

233
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:15,479
You're talking to an ex-bot fighter,
It takes a lot more than this to rattle me.

234
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:17,418
Yup, his nervous.

235
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,895
Oh! You have nothing
to fear little fella.

236
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:20,296
He's so tense.

237
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,739
- No! I'm not.
- Relax, Hiro...

238
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:25,491
Your tech is amazing!
Tell him, Gogo...

239
00:16:25,574 --> 00:16:26,980
Stop whining, woman up.

240
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:28,106
I'm fine.

241
00:16:28,181 --> 00:16:31,844
What you need, little man? Deodorant
breath mint, fresh pair of under pants?

242
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,993
- Under pants? You need serious help.
- Hey, I come prepared.

243
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:38,517
I haven't done laundry in 6 months.
One pair last me four days.

244
00:16:38,595 --> 00:16:42,986
I go front, I go back, I go inside out
then I go front and back.

245
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:46,518
- Wow! That is both disgusting and awesome.
- Don't encourage him.

246
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:48,389
It's called "recycling".

247
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:51,469
Next Presenter: Hiro Hamada.

248
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,958
- Oh yeah! This is it!
- I guess I'm up.

249
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,560
Okay! Okay, photo! Photo!
Everybody say: "Hiro!"

250
00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:58,020
Hiro!

251
00:16:58,288 --> 00:17:00,590
- We love you, Hiro. Good luck!
- Don't mess it up.

252
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:01,228
Break a leg little man!

253
00:17:01,422 --> 00:17:02,962
Science, yeah!

254
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,384
Alright! Bro. This is it!

255
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:08,157
Come on, don't leave me hanging.

256
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,183
What's going on?

257
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:14,729
I really wanna go here.

258
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:16,360
Hey...

259
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:18,707
You got this.

260
00:17:28,653 --> 00:17:30,233
Hi...

261
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:32,296
My name is Hiro...

262
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,408
Sorry.

263
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:39,320
My name is Hiro Hamada.

264
00:17:40,252 --> 00:17:40,752
And

265
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:43,671
I've been working on something
that I think is pretty cool.

266
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,568
I hope you like it.

267
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,631
This, is a microbot.

268
00:17:58,385 --> 00:18:00,134
Breathe.

269
00:18:03,362 --> 00:18:04,665
It doesn't look like much.

270
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:05,425
But...

271
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:07,637
when it links up with
the rest of its pals..

272
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,543
Things gonna get a little more interesting.

273
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:33,680
The Microbots are controlled
with this neurotransmitters.

274
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:40,619
I think about what I want them to do...

275
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:44,997
They do it.

276
00:18:47,987 --> 00:18:51,179
The applications for
this tech are limitless.

277
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:52,915
Construction...

278
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:55,221
What use to take teams of people

279
00:18:55,274 --> 00:18:58,013
working by hands for months or years.

280
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,261
Can now be accomplished by one person.

281
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,926
And that's just the beginning...

282
00:19:05,031 --> 00:19:06,219
How about...

283
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:07,873
Transportation?

284
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:13,033
Microbots can move anything,
anywhere, with ease.

285
00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:22,355
If you can think it...

286
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:24,180
microbots can do it.

287
00:19:28,582 --> 00:19:30,407
The only limit is your imagination.

288
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:34,698
Microbots!

289
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:44,151
That's my nephew!

290
00:19:45,103 --> 00:19:47,976
My Family!
I love my family!

291
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:49,553
Nailed it!

292
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,876
- You did it!
- You did it bad.

293
00:19:52,884 --> 00:19:54,701
- Good job, Hiro.
- It blows my mind, dude.

294
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:57,135
They loved you.
That was amazing!

295
00:19:57,232 --> 00:19:58,635
Yes.

296
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:03,165
With some development,
your tech could be revolutionary.

297
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,224
Alastair Krei.

298
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,111
May I?

299
00:20:10,714 --> 00:20:11,624
Extraordinary.

300
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:15,884
I want your microbots at Krei Tech.

301
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:17,482
Shut up.

302
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,020
Mr. Krei is right.

303
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,058
Your microbots are an
inspired piece of tech.

304
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:24,001
You can continue to develop them...

305
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,871
Or you can sell them to a man whose
only guided by his own self interest.

306
00:20:27,914 --> 00:20:30,798
Robert, I know how you feel about me.

307
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,791
- But it shouldn't affect you...
- This is your decision, Hiro.

308
00:20:33,828 --> 00:20:36,338
But you should know,
Mr. Krei has cut corners

309
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:38,872
and ignored sound science
to get where he is.

310
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,238
That's just not true.

311
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,411
I wouldn't trust Krei Tech
with your microbots

312
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:45,009
or anything else

313
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,054
Hiro...

314
00:20:47,221 --> 00:20:50,857
I'm offering you more money than any
fourteen year old could imagine.

315
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:57,640
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Krei.
But they are not for sale.

316
00:20:58,403 --> 00:21:01,175
I thought you were smarter than that.

317
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:03,819
Robert.

318
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:05,974
Mr. Krei...

319
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,893
That's my brother's.

320
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,148
Oh, that's right.

321
00:21:18,368 --> 00:21:20,521
I'm looking forward of
seeing you in class...

322
00:21:26,143 --> 00:21:28,676
Alright geniuses!
Let's feed those hungry brains.

323
00:21:28,756 --> 00:21:31,902
Back to cafes, dinner is on me.

324
00:21:31,928 --> 00:21:34,370
Yes! Nothing is better than free food.

325
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:35,949
Aunt Cass...
Unless it's moldy.

326
00:21:35,988 --> 00:21:38,219
- We'll catch up, okay?
- Sure.

327
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:40,180
I'm so proud of you!

328
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:43,159
- Both of you!
- Thanks, Aunt Cass.

329
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,510
I know what you gonna say.

330
00:21:53,594 --> 00:21:56,005
I should be proud of
myself because I'm finally

331
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:58,440
using my gift for
something important..

332
00:21:58,521 --> 00:22:01,394
No! No, I was just gonna tell you,
your fly was down for the whole show.

333
00:22:01,465 --> 00:22:03,940
Haha, Hilarious!

334
00:22:04,815 --> 00:22:06,062
What?
Ahh!

335
00:22:12,406 --> 00:22:14,542
Welcome to nerd school!

336
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,966
Nerd!

337
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:18,680
Hey, I am...

338
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:21,547
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you, so...

339
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,599
You know...

340
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:26,339
Thanks for not giving up on me.

341
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,393
Are you okay?

342
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:44,881
Yeah, I'm okay.
But Professor Callaghan is still in there.

343
00:22:47,217 --> 00:22:49,093
Tadashi, No!

344
00:22:53,734 --> 00:22:55,644
Callaghan's in there.

345
00:22:55,658 --> 00:22:57,658
Someone has to help.

346
00:23:23,108 --> 00:23:24,768
Tadashi!

347
00:23:25,768 --> 00:23:27,620
Tadashi!

348
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:51,969
Hey...
Sweetie...

349
00:24:52,547 --> 00:24:54,034
Hey, Aunt Cass.

350
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:56,841
Mrs. Matsuda is in the cafe.
She is wearing

351
00:24:56,854 --> 00:24:59,579
something super inappropriate
for an 80 year old.

352
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:01,928
It always cracks me up.

353
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,960
You should come down.

354
00:25:04,238 --> 00:25:05,804
Maybe later.

355
00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:08,597
Oh, the university called again.

356
00:25:09,194 --> 00:25:12,059
It's been a few weeks
since classes started,

357
00:25:12,072 --> 00:25:14,947
but they said its not
too late to register.

358
00:25:15,156 --> 00:25:17,205
Okay, thanks.

359
00:25:17,306 --> 00:25:19,004
I'll think about it.

360
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:35,846
Bot Fights.

361
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,030
Hi, Hiro!

362
00:25:39,057 --> 00:25:41,943
We just wanted to check in
and see how you're doing.

363
00:25:42,031 --> 00:25:43,470
We wish you were here, buddy.

364
00:25:43,486 --> 00:25:46,437
Hiro, if I could have only one
super power right now...

365
00:25:46,454 --> 00:25:50,638
It would be the ability to crawl through
this camera and give you a big hug.

366
00:26:10,827 --> 00:26:12,066
Awww...

367
00:26:47,343 --> 00:26:52,288
Hello, I am Baymax.
Your personal health care companion.

368
00:26:52,463 --> 00:26:53,705
Hey...

369
00:26:53,794 --> 00:26:57,065
Baymax, I didn't know
you were still active.

370
00:26:57,107 --> 00:27:01,026
I heard a sound of distress.
What seems to be the trouble?

371
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,629
Oh, I just had my toe a little.
I'm fine.

372
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,839
On a scale of 1 to 10,
How would you rate your pain?

373
00:27:08,925 --> 00:27:10,159
Zero?

374
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:13,496
I'm okay, really.
Thanks. You can shrink now.

375
00:27:13,607 --> 00:27:17,208
- Does it hurt when I touch it?
- That's okay. No! No touching!

376
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:18,636
Ahh! Ahhh!

377
00:27:22,803 --> 00:27:23,303
Awwww!

378
00:27:25,117 --> 00:27:26,693
You have fallen.

379
00:27:26,755 --> 00:27:28,073
You think?

380
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:31,764
On a scale of one...

381
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:32,920
On a scale...

382
00:27:33,205 --> 00:27:34,269
On a scale...

383
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:36,549
On a scale of one to ten...

384
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:40,898
On a scale of one to ten,
How would you rate your pain?

385
00:27:41,021 --> 00:27:42,241
Zero.

386
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,520
- It is alright to cry.
- No! No...

387
00:27:44,603 --> 00:27:47,633
- Crying is a natural response to pain.
- I'm not crying.

388
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:50,265
- I will scan you for injury.
- Don't scan me.

389
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,978
- Scan complete.
- Unbelievable!

390
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:54,092
You have sustained no injuries.

391
00:27:54,113 --> 00:27:56,842
However, your hormone and
neurotransmitter levels

392
00:27:56,855 --> 00:27:59,595
indicate that you are
experiencing mood swings.

393
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:02,649
Common on adolescenes.
Diagnosis:

394
00:28:02,754 --> 00:28:03,761
Puberty.

395
00:28:03,855 --> 00:28:04,899
Whooh! What?

396
00:28:04,902 --> 00:28:07,395
Okay, time to shrink now.

397
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:09,573
You should expect an increase in body hair.

398
00:28:09,612 --> 00:28:13,054
Especially on your face, chest, armpits
, and...

399
00:28:13,153 --> 00:28:14,526
Thank you, that's enough.

400
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,538
You may also experience strange
and powerful new urges.

401
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:19,651
Okay, let's go you back in your luggage.

402
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,814
I can not deactivate until you say:
You are satisfied with your care.

403
00:28:23,865 --> 00:28:26,385
Fine, I'm satisfied with my...

404
00:28:26,515 --> 00:28:27,614
Woooh ohh!

405
00:28:39,107 --> 00:28:41,288
My microbot?

406
00:28:41,742 --> 00:28:43,428
This doesn't make any sense.

407
00:28:43,512 --> 00:28:47,999
Puberty can often be a confusing time for
young adolescent flowering into a manhood.

408
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,138
No!

409
00:28:49,238 --> 00:28:52,006
The thing is attracted
with other microbot, but...

410
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,796
That's impossible, they were
destroyed in a fire.

411
00:28:55,654 --> 00:28:57,466
Damn thing is broken.

412
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:10,380
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

413
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:14,041
Oh, yeah? Why don't you find
out where he is trying to go?

414
00:29:14,057 --> 00:29:16,980
Would that stabilize your
pubescent mood swings?

415
00:29:17,886 --> 00:29:19,606
Absolutely.

416
00:29:24,828 --> 00:29:26,198
Baymax?

417
00:29:27,763 --> 00:29:29,070
Baymax?

418
00:29:30,241 --> 00:29:31,696
Baymax?

419
00:29:40,152 --> 00:29:41,406
What?

420
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,332
Hiro?

421
00:29:47,382 --> 00:29:48,572
Hey! Aunt Cass...

422
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:51,988
- Wow, you're up?
- Yeah, I figured it was time.

423
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,966
Are you registering for school?

424
00:29:53,978 --> 00:29:57,072
Ah, yes. I've thought about what you said.
Really inspired me.

425
00:29:57,081 --> 00:29:59,642
Oh, honey. That's so great!

426
00:29:59,707 --> 00:30:03,750
Okay, special dinner tonight.
I leave up some chicken wings...

427
00:30:03,924 --> 00:30:06,953
You know, with a hot sauce
that makes us faces numb.

428
00:30:07,115 --> 00:30:08,708
Okay, sounds good.

429
00:30:08,754 --> 00:30:10,665
Great!
Last hug.

430
00:30:21,763 --> 00:30:23,224
Baymax!

431
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:32,399
Baymax!

432
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:46,963
Baymax!

433
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:05,537
Baymax!

434
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:09,131
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

435
00:31:09,215 --> 00:31:12,319
I have found where your
tiny robot wants to go..

436
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:16,316
I told you, its broken!
It's not trying to go...

437
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,632
Locked.

438
00:31:26,742 --> 00:31:28,626
There is a window.

439
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:36,444
Please exercise caution. A fall from
this height could lead to bodily harm.

440
00:31:56,197 --> 00:31:57,798
Oh, no.

441
00:31:58,802 --> 00:32:01,774
Excuse me, while I let out some air.

442
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:12,898
Are you done?

443
00:32:14,555 --> 00:32:15,804
Yes.

444
00:32:18,006 --> 00:32:20,243
It will take me a moment to re-inflate.

445
00:32:20,258 --> 00:32:22,599
Fine, just keep it down.

446
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,189
My microbots?

447
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:18,406
Someone's making more.

448
00:33:24,225 --> 00:33:25,539
Hiro?

449
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,918
You gave me a heart attack.

450
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:30,688
My hands are equipped with defibrillators.

451
00:33:30,796 --> 00:33:32,258
- Clear!
- Stop! Stop!

452
00:33:32,287 --> 00:33:34,132
It's just an expression!

453
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:41,082
Oh, no!

454
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:46,033
Run!

455
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,021
Oh, come on!

456
00:33:48,131 --> 00:33:49,294
I am not fast.

457
00:33:49,368 --> 00:33:51,011
Yeah, no kidding!

458
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:53,465
Go! Go!
Come on!

459
00:33:53,694 --> 00:33:55,205
Kick it down!

460
00:33:55,504 --> 00:33:56,998
Punch it!

461
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:01,472
Go! Go!

462
00:34:06,285 --> 00:34:08,505
Come on, go! go!

463
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:18,901
Move it!

464
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,331
Come on!

465
00:34:36,236 --> 00:34:38,356
Come on!
The window!

466
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,538
Suck it in!

467
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,534
Baymax!

468
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:50,816
Hiro?

469
00:35:01,322 --> 00:35:03,534
Come on! Let's get out of here!
Go! Hurry!

470
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:11,310
Alright, let me get this straight.

471
00:35:11,314 --> 00:35:17,107
A man in a kabuki mask attacked you
with an army of miniature flying robot.

472
00:35:17,221 --> 00:35:18,721
Microbots!

473
00:35:19,436 --> 00:35:20,987
Microbots.

474
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:23,067
Yeah, he was controlling
them telepathically

475
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,115
with a neurocranial transmitter.

476
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:32,158
So Mr. Kabuki was using ESP to
attack you and balloon man.

477
00:36:02,637 --> 00:36:06,589
Did you file a report when your
flying robots was stolen?

478
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:09,172
No, I thought they were all destroyed.

479
00:36:09,204 --> 00:36:13,174
Look, I know it sounds crazy but
Baymax was there too. Tell him.

480
00:36:13,232 --> 00:36:16,775
Yes, officer. He is telling the tru... th.

481
00:36:19,004 --> 00:36:21,205
What that...
What's wrong with you?

482
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:23,879
Low battery.

483
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:29,864
Whoa! Whoa, try to keep it ho..me

484
00:36:29,945 --> 00:36:33,492
I am a health care, your personal Baymax...

485
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:37,871
Kid, How about we call your parents
and get them down here.

486
00:36:37,933 --> 00:36:38,780
What?

487
00:36:38,844 --> 00:36:42,761
Write your name and number down
in this piece of paper, and we can...

488
00:36:46,756 --> 00:36:49,623
I gotta get you home to
your charging station.

489
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:51,240
Can you walk?

490
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:54,346
I almost scan you now.
Scan complete.

491
00:36:55,154 --> 00:36:56,913
Health care.

492
00:37:04,484 --> 00:37:05,774
Okay...

493
00:37:05,778 --> 00:37:09,431
If my aunt asked, we are
at school all day, got it?

494
00:37:09,465 --> 00:37:13,845
- We jump out of window.
- No, But be quiet! Shhh!

495
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:17,586
We jump out of window.

496
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,099
But you can't say things like
that in front of Aunt Cass.

497
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,265
Hiro?

498
00:37:34,527 --> 00:37:36,177
You home, sweetie?

499
00:37:36,859 --> 00:37:38,136
That's right!

500
00:37:38,145 --> 00:37:40,399
I thought I heard you.
Hi!

501
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:42,725
Hey! Aunt Cass.

502
00:37:42,773 --> 00:37:47,407
Oh, look at my little college man.
Ah! I can't wait to hear all about it.

503
00:37:47,457 --> 00:37:48,675
Oh! It means its almost ready.

504
00:37:49,147 --> 00:37:49,802
Weeeehh!

505
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,601
- You be quiet?
- Yeah, Weeeehhh!

506
00:37:55,048 --> 00:37:57,991
Alright, get ready to have
your face melted.

507
00:37:58,182 --> 00:38:01,975
We are gonna feel this things tomorrow.
You know what I'm saying?

508
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,754
Okay, sit down, tell me everything.

509
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:13,142
The thing is, since I
registered too late.

510
00:38:13,155 --> 00:38:15,803
I've got a lot of school
stuff to catch up on.

511
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:17,967
What was that?

512
00:38:18,828 --> 00:38:20,140
Mochi.

513
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,065
Oh! That darn cat.

514
00:38:25,076 --> 00:38:27,538
Oh! Just take a plate for the road, okay?

515
00:38:29,026 --> 00:38:31,548
- Don't work too hard.
- Thanks for understanding.

516
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,726
Hairy baby.

517
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:38,111
Hairy baby.

518
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,185
Alright, come on.

519
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:44,634
I'll carry on, I'm your personal Baymax.

520
00:38:44,693 --> 00:38:47,153
One foot in front of the other.

521
00:39:00,245 --> 00:39:02,418
This doesn't make any sense.

522
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,038
Tadashi.

523
00:39:07,963 --> 00:39:09,150
What?

524
00:39:10,242 --> 00:39:11,830
Tadashi.

525
00:39:16,477 --> 00:39:18,235
Tadashi's gone.

526
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:20,114
When will he return?

527
00:39:20,545 --> 00:39:22,559
He is dead, Baymax.

528
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,943
Tadashi was in excellent health.

529
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:34,330
With a proper diet and exercise,
He should have lived a long life.

530
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,670
Yeah, He should have.

531
00:39:38,314 --> 00:39:40,749
But there is a fire...

532
00:39:42,118 --> 00:39:43,768
Now he's gone.

533
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:46,447
Tadashi is here.

534
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:49,948
No, people keep saying
he is not really gone.

535
00:39:50,037 --> 00:39:52,095
As long as who remember him.

536
00:39:54,956 --> 00:39:56,614
Still hurts..

537
00:39:56,863 --> 00:39:59,995
I seen no evidence of physical injury.

538
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,536
It's a different kind of hurt.

539
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:07,752
You are my patient.
I would like to help.

540
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,642
You can't fix this one buddy.

541
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:14,701
Ah..What are you doing?

542
00:40:14,732 --> 00:40:17,929
I am downloading a
database on personal lose.

543
00:40:18,305 --> 00:40:19,975
Database downloaded.

544
00:40:19,976 --> 00:40:23,357
Treatments include: Contact with friends,
and loved ones.

545
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:26,048
- I am contacting them now.
- No! No, don't do that.

546
00:40:26,087 --> 00:40:28,928
- Your friends have been contacted.
- Unbelievable!

547
00:40:30,252 --> 00:40:31,563
Now what are you doing?

548
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:35,663
Other treatments include: Compassion,
and physical reassurance.

549
00:40:35,685 --> 00:40:37,207
I'm okay, really.

550
00:40:37,274 --> 00:40:39,053
You will be alright.

551
00:40:41,418 --> 00:40:43,586
Thanks, Baymax.

552
00:40:44,132 --> 00:40:46,597
I am sorry about the fire.

553
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:49,550
It's okay, it was an accident.

554
00:40:56,668 --> 00:40:58,401
Unless...

555
00:40:58,695 --> 00:41:01,049
Unless it wasn't a...

556
00:41:01,277 --> 00:41:05,566
Ah! Ah! The showcase, the guy in
the masked stole my microbots

557
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,363
and set the fire to cover his tracks.

558
00:41:08,391 --> 00:41:11,427
He's responsible for Tadashi.

559
00:41:11,564 --> 00:41:13,752
We gotta catch that guy.

560
00:41:16,313 --> 00:41:22,402
It's alive, It's alive,
It's alive, It's alive!

561
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:28,851
If we're gonna catch that guy,
you need some upgrades.

562
00:41:29,247 --> 00:41:32,631
Will apprehending the man in the
masked improve your emotional state?

563
00:41:32,632 --> 00:41:34,309
Absolutely!

564
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:36,677
Let's work on your moves.

565
00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:57,034
Now let's take care of this.

566
00:42:29,076 --> 00:42:31,044
I have some concerns.

567
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:35,260
This armor may undermine my
non-threatening huggable design.

568
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:37,320
That's gotta be the idea buddy.

569
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:38,939
You look sick!

570
00:42:39,016 --> 00:42:41,805
I can not be sick.
I'm a robot.

571
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:43,470
It's just an expression.

572
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:45,528
Data transfer complete.

573
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,427
I fail to see how karate makes me
a better health care companion.

574
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:17,085
You wanna keep me healthy, don't you?

575
00:43:17,096 --> 00:43:18,438
Punch this.

576
00:43:21,178 --> 00:43:22,253
Yes!

577
00:43:22,342 --> 00:43:23,616
Hammer fist!

578
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:25,752
Side kick!

579
00:43:25,822 --> 00:43:27,036
Knife hand!

580
00:43:27,325 --> 00:43:28,788
Back kick!

581
00:43:29,111 --> 00:43:30,580
Gummy Bears!

582
00:43:34,608 --> 00:43:35,941
Yes!

583
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,256
Yeah, fist bump..

584
00:43:48,804 --> 00:43:51,351
Fist bump is not in my fighting database.

585
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:53,758
No, this isn't a fighting thing.

586
00:43:53,814 --> 00:43:58,660
It's what people do sometimes when
they are excited or pumped up.

587
00:44:10,727 --> 00:44:12,328
Hey, now you're getting it.

588
00:44:12,418 --> 00:44:15,167
I will add fist bump to my
care giving matrix.

589
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,670
Altight! Lets go get that guy.

590
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:22,321
Come on!

591
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:52,016
Get him, Baymax!

592
00:44:55,346 --> 00:44:56,788
We're too late.

593
00:44:58,844 --> 00:45:01,913
Your tiny robot is trying to go somewhere.

594
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,391
Come on.

595
00:45:12,767 --> 00:45:16,297
Always wait one hour after
eating before swimming.

596
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,774
Hey!

597
00:45:26,926 --> 00:45:28,320
Come on!

598
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,376
Your heart rate has increased dramatically.

599
00:45:57,784 --> 00:46:00,868
Okay, Baymax.
Time to use those upgrades.

600
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:09,090
Hiro?

601
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:12,234
No! No, get out of here!
Go!

602
00:46:12,244 --> 00:46:14,199
What are you doing out here?

603
00:46:14,331 --> 00:46:18,274
Nothing! Just stop for a walk.
Helps my pubescent mood swings.

604
00:46:18,325 --> 00:46:21,068
- Is that Baymax?
- Yeah, but you really...

605
00:46:21,133 --> 00:46:24,326
Ahh! Why is he wearing
carbon fiber under pants?

606
00:46:24,343 --> 00:46:25,996
I also know Karate.

607
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,262
- You guys need to go.
- No, don't push us away, Hiro.

608
00:46:29,315 --> 00:46:31,994
We're here for you.
That's why Baymax contacted us.

609
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:36,776
Those who suffer a lose, requires
support from friends and loved ones.

610
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:39,170
Who would like to share
their feelings first?

611
00:46:39,247 --> 00:46:40,637
Oh! I'll go!
Okay!

612
00:46:40,906 --> 00:46:43,323
My name is Fred, and it
has been 30 days since...

613
00:46:43,422 --> 00:46:45,565
Holy Mother of Megazod!

614
00:46:48,017 --> 00:46:50,122
Am I the only one seeing this?

615
00:46:53,332 --> 00:46:57,528
Aaahhh, My gosh!
Oh no!

616
00:46:59,843 --> 00:47:03,040
Go! Baymax, get him!

617
00:47:03,865 --> 00:47:06,253
No! No! No, what are you doing?

618
00:47:06,284 --> 00:47:07,915
I'm saving your life.

619
00:47:07,963 --> 00:47:10,003
Baymax can handle that guy.

620
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:15,627
Oh, no!

621
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,011
Wasabi!

622
00:47:19,024 --> 00:47:20,489
Goodbye!

623
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,337
Hiro, explanation now!

624
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:27,737
He stole my microbots, he started the fire.
I don't know who he is!

625
00:47:28,017 --> 00:47:30,077
Baymax, palm hill strike!

626
00:47:39,228 --> 00:47:41,007
Hard left!

627
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:54,287
That Mask, black suit...

628
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,509
We are under attack from a
super villain people!

629
00:47:56,536 --> 00:48:00,869
I mean, how cool is that?
I mean it's scary obviously, but how cool?

630
00:48:06,023 --> 00:48:08,195
- Why are we stopped?
- The lights red.

631
00:48:08,293 --> 00:48:11,138
There are no red lights in a car chase!

632
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:15,831
Why is he trying to kill us?

633
00:48:16,105 --> 00:48:17,995
Why are you trying to kill us?

634
00:48:17,997 --> 00:48:20,185
It's classic villain, we've seen too much!
.

635
00:48:20,216 --> 00:48:23,648
Let's not jump to conclusions,
We don't know he is trying kill us.

636
00:48:23,687 --> 00:48:24,579
Car!

637
00:48:24,593 --> 00:48:26,414
He is trying to kill us!

638
00:48:27,749 --> 00:48:29,516
Did you just put your blinker on?

639
00:48:29,535 --> 00:48:32,463
You have to indicate your
turn, it's the law!

640
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:34,531
That's it!

641
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:10,058
Stop the car!
Baymax and I can take this guy!

642
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:16,090
Seat belts save lives.

643
00:49:16,102 --> 00:49:18,100
Buckle up everytime.

644
00:49:26,225 --> 00:49:27,284
Whoa!
Whoa!

645
00:49:27,399 --> 00:49:31,244
What are you doing!
What are you doing?

646
00:49:41,787 --> 00:49:42,972
I think we lose him.

647
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:44,280
Watch out!

648
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,847
Baymax, hold on!

649
00:49:51,627 --> 00:49:53,187
- We are not gonna make it!
- We are gonna make it!

650
00:49:53,378 --> 00:49:54,519
- We are not gonna make it!
- We are gonna make it!

651
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,982
- We are not gonna make it!
- We are gonna make it!

652
00:49:58,867 --> 00:50:00,713
We made it!
Yes!

653
00:50:37,628 --> 00:50:40,187
I told you we're gonna make it.

654
00:50:40,277 --> 00:50:44,882
Your injuries require my attention
and your body temperatures are low.

655
00:50:44,966 --> 00:50:46,514
We should get out of here.

656
00:50:46,534 --> 00:50:48,059
I know a place.

657
00:50:51,896 --> 00:50:53,606
Where are we?

658
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:57,123
Fred?

659
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:58,760
Where are you going?

660
00:50:59,908 --> 00:51:04,593
Oh, welcome to Mi Casa.
It's French for "front door".

661
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:06,478
It's really not.

662
00:51:06,498 --> 00:51:10,542
Listen, nitwit!
A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us.

663
00:51:10,556 --> 00:51:12,344
I'm not in the mood Fred.

664
00:51:12,497 --> 00:51:14,824
Welcome home, Master. Frederick.

665
00:51:14,874 --> 00:51:16,840
Heathcliff, my man!

666
00:51:16,914 --> 00:51:19,166
Come on in guys.
We'll be safe in here.

667
00:51:19,223 --> 00:51:20,818
Give me some.

668
00:51:27,738 --> 00:51:29,270
Freddie?

669
00:51:29,512 --> 00:51:31,115
This is your house?

670
00:51:31,169 --> 00:51:33,442
I thought you lived
under a bridge.

671
00:51:33,477 --> 00:51:37,515
Well, technically it belongs to my parents.
They are on a vacay in a family island.

672
00:51:37,565 --> 00:51:40,315
We should totally go sometime.
For a luck!

673
00:51:44,032 --> 00:51:46,434
You gotta be kidding me.

674
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,208
- Fred, do not touch!
- Fred.

675
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:54,038
If I wasn't just attacked
by a guy in a kabuki mask.

676
00:51:54,047 --> 00:51:56,972
I think this would be the
weirdest thing I've seen today.

677
00:51:57,108 --> 00:52:00,092
My brain hates my
eyes for saying this.

678
00:52:00,542 --> 00:52:02,921
Your body temperature is still low.

679
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,256
Yeah, uh-huh.

680
00:52:11,935 --> 00:52:14,407
Ahh! It's like spooning
a warm marshmallow.

681
00:52:14,783 --> 00:52:17,382
Oh! It's so nice!
Ah yeah!

682
00:52:17,407 --> 00:52:18,664
Ah! It's toasted.

683
00:52:19,468 --> 00:52:21,311
Ahh! Good robot.

684
00:52:24,837 --> 00:52:27,042
Do you know the meaning
of this symbol, friends?

685
00:52:27,129 --> 00:52:29,154
Yes, it's a bird!

686
00:52:29,255 --> 00:52:33,055
No! The guy in the mask was carrying
something with this symbol on it.

687
00:52:33,147 --> 00:52:36,964
Apprehending the man in the mask will
improve Hiro's emotional state.

688
00:52:36,994 --> 00:52:40,295
Apprehend him?
We don't even know who he is!

689
00:52:40,367 --> 00:52:42,092
I have a theory.

690
00:52:43,104 --> 00:52:45,162
Dr. Slaughter MD?

691
00:52:45,217 --> 00:52:48,947
Actually, millionaire weapons designer,
Malcolm Chastletick.

692
00:52:48,973 --> 00:52:50,231
The annihilator?

693
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:54,592
Behind the mask, industrialists.
Reed X worthy.

694
00:52:54,763 --> 00:52:58,229
Baron von De-Struck?
Oh, just get to the point!

695
00:52:58,261 --> 00:52:59,567
Don't you guys get it?

696
00:52:59,633 --> 00:53:04,035
The man in the masked who attacked us,
Is none other than...

697
00:53:04,113 --> 00:53:05,143
Voila!

698
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,737
Alastair Krei.

699
00:53:06,819 --> 00:53:07,701
What?

700
00:53:07,729 --> 00:53:11,123
Think about it, Krei wanted your
microbots and you said no.

701
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:13,711
Rules don't apply to a man like Krei.

702
00:53:13,802 --> 00:53:16,746
There's no way!
The guy's too high profile.

703
00:53:16,764 --> 00:53:18,714
Then who was that guy in the mask?

704
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:22,473
I don't know, we don't know
anything about him.

705
00:53:22,611 --> 00:53:26,053
His blood type is AB negative.
Cholesterol levels are...

706
00:53:26,092 --> 00:53:28,081
Baymax, you scanned him?

707
00:53:28,112 --> 00:53:31,018
I am programmed to assess
everyone's health care needs.

708
00:53:31,062 --> 00:53:32,595
Yes!

709
00:53:32,608 --> 00:53:35,249
I can use the data from
your scan to find him.

710
00:53:35,323 --> 00:53:37,928
Uh, you'd have to scan everyone in
San Fransokyo...

711
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,302
and that might take,
I don't know, forever?

712
00:53:41,338 --> 00:53:44,585
No! No... No, I just have to look
for another angle.

713
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:48,491
Got it!, I'll scan the whole city
at the same time.

714
00:53:48,572 --> 00:53:50,907
I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.

715
00:53:54,385 --> 00:53:58,979
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy.
I need to upgrade all of you.

716
00:53:58,983 --> 00:54:00,336
Upgrade who now?

717
00:54:00,374 --> 00:54:05,240
Those who suffer a lose, requires
support from friends and loved ones.

718
00:54:05,407 --> 00:54:07,397
Oh wohhooh!
Okay! I like where this is heading.

719
00:54:07,403 --> 00:54:10,044
We can't go against that guy!
We're nerds!

720
00:54:10,089 --> 00:54:13,809
Hiro, we want to help,
But we're just us.

721
00:54:13,905 --> 00:54:15,048
No!

722
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,768
You can be way more.

723
00:54:20,144 --> 00:54:23,294
Tadashi Hamada is our best friend.

724
00:54:23,512 --> 00:54:24,810
We're in.

725
00:54:25,234 --> 00:54:26,756
Can you feel it?

726
00:54:26,802 --> 00:54:30,005
Do you guys can feel these?
Our origin story begins.

727
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:32,558
We are gonna be Superhero!

728
00:54:32,652 --> 00:54:33,878
Arms up!

729
00:54:34,445 --> 00:54:36,798
The neurotransmitters must be in his mask.

730
00:54:36,809 --> 00:54:39,978
We get the mask,
then he can't control the bots.

731
00:54:39,983 --> 00:54:40,863

- I love it.
- Not bad.

780
00:56:38,506 --> 00:56:40,667
Anybody else whose suit
riding up on them?

781
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:43,327
Hey guys!
Check this out.

782
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:47,943
I'd like to introduce,
Baymax 2.0.

783
00:56:54,584 --> 00:56:56,397
Huh! He's glorious.

784
00:56:58,168 --> 00:56:59,541
Hello.

785
00:57:02,388 --> 00:57:05,295
Whoaah! Hold up!
Focus!

786
00:57:05,707 --> 00:57:07,690
Show them what you got, buddy!

787
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:10,948
The Fist!
Show them the fist!

788
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,243
Balalala...
No!

789
00:57:15,439 --> 00:57:16,647
Not that!

790
00:57:16,776 --> 00:57:19,394
The thing!
The other thing.

791
00:57:24,298 --> 00:57:25,413
Whoaah!

792
00:57:25,621 --> 00:57:29,095
Rocket fist!
Make Freddie so happy.

793
00:57:30,207 --> 00:57:32,651
That's just one of his new upgrades.

794
00:57:32,722 --> 00:57:34,486
Baymax, wings!

795
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:36,905
No way!

796
00:57:44,172 --> 00:57:45,500
Thrusters!

797
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:50,690
I fail to see how flying makes me a
better health care companion.

798
00:57:50,706 --> 00:57:54,065
I fail to see how you fail to see,
that it's awesome!

799
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,471
Full thrust!

800
00:57:59,343 --> 00:58:01,573
Whoaah!
Waah!

801
00:58:05,689 --> 00:58:07,686
Hey big guy!

802
00:58:08,096 --> 00:58:09,962
Let's just take this slow.

803
00:58:10,406 --> 00:58:13,661
Up! Up! Up!
Thrust! Thrust! Thrust!

804
00:58:15,352 --> 00:58:19,124
Too much thrust! Too much thrust!
Too much thrust!

805
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:26,147
No! No, no... back on!
Back on! On! On!

806
00:58:33,026 --> 00:58:34,010
Up, up!

807
00:58:34,699 --> 00:58:36,622
Ahhh!

808
00:58:40,177 --> 00:58:42,313
Oh, man!

809
00:58:42,636 --> 00:58:45,712
Maybe! Maybe enough flying for today.

810
00:58:46,074 --> 00:58:47,386
What do you say?

811
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,152
Your neurotransmitter
levels are rising steadily.

812
00:58:50,218 --> 00:58:52,504
Which means what?

813
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:55,518
The treatment is working.

814
00:58:56,401 --> 00:58:57,966
Oh, no!

815
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,451
No, no!

816
00:58:59,521 --> 00:59:02,597
Oooh, Baymax!

817
00:59:06,855 --> 00:59:08,412
Yes!

818
01:00:58,070 --> 01:00:59,787
Woohh...!

819
01:01:01,982 --> 01:01:03,903
That was...

820
01:01:04,858 --> 01:01:06,547
That was...

821
01:01:06,818 --> 01:01:08,460
Sick.

822
01:01:09,113 --> 01:01:11,289
It is just an expression.

823
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:13,936
Thats! Thats right buddy.

824
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:20,979
I am never taking the bus again.

825
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:26,913
Your emotional state has improved.

826
01:01:27,053 --> 01:01:31,135
I can deactivate if you say:
You are satisfied with your care.

827
01:01:31,172 --> 01:01:32,484
What?

828
01:01:32,574 --> 01:01:35,065
No, I don't want you to deactivate.

829
01:01:35,345 --> 01:01:37,224
We still have to find that guy.

830
01:01:37,234 --> 01:01:39,689
So, fire up that super sensor.

831
01:01:44,503 --> 01:01:46,514
Functionality improved.

832
01:01:46,555 --> 01:01:49,752
1000% increase in range.

833
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:54,178
I have found a match.

834
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:57,389
On that island.

835
01:02:01,553 --> 01:02:02,918
Killer view!

836
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:07,167
Yeah, If I wasn't terrified of heights,
I'd probably love this.

837
01:02:07,234 --> 01:02:10,019
But I'm terrified of heights,
so I don't love it.

838
01:02:15,134 --> 01:02:16,438
There.

839
01:02:16,448 --> 01:02:18,410
Baymax, take us in.

840
01:02:25,084 --> 01:02:26,298
Awesome!

841
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,577
Our first landing together as a team.

842
01:02:28,664 --> 01:02:30,317
Guys, come on!

843
01:02:30,555 --> 01:02:32,120
Quarantine?

844
01:02:32,391 --> 01:02:34,686
Do you people know what quarantine means?

845
01:02:34,783 --> 01:02:38,384
Quarantine, enforced isolation
to prevent contamination

846
01:02:38,409 --> 01:02:40,146
that could lead to disease
or in some cases...

847
01:02:40,147 --> 01:02:41,433
Death.

848
01:02:41,516 --> 01:02:44,585
- Oh! There's a skull face on this one.
- A skull face!

849
01:02:44,668 --> 01:02:48,263
Be ready.
He could be anywhere.

850
01:02:52,106 --> 01:02:54,492
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

851
01:03:01,726 --> 01:03:03,832
That was a bird.

852
01:03:04,268 --> 01:03:07,943
Well, at least we know
our gear works.

853
01:03:23,111 --> 01:03:28,550
Six centreped friends lead
by Fred, their leader Fred.

854
01:03:28,621 --> 01:03:30,533
Fred's Angels.

855
01:03:31,157 --> 01:03:33,036
Fred's Angels.

856
01:03:33,585 --> 01:03:39,706
Harnessing the power of the sun with
the ancient amulet they found in the attic.

857
01:03:41,061 --> 01:03:42,930
The amulet is green.

858
01:03:43,872 --> 01:03:45,451
It's probably an emerald.

859
01:03:45,482 --> 01:03:47,847
Fred, I'll laser hand you on the face!

860
01:03:47,914 --> 01:03:49,729
Guys! Ssshhhh...

861
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:51,624
Any sign of him, Baymax?

862
01:03:52,716 --> 01:03:56,066
The structure is interfering
with my sensor.

863
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:58,348
Perfect! The robot's broken.

864
01:03:59,137 --> 01:04:02,125
Ah! Guys, you might wanna see this.

865
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,156
What do you think it is, genius?

866
01:04:17,169 --> 01:04:19,109
Ah! I'm not sure.

867
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:20,451
But look.

868
01:04:21,956 --> 01:04:23,366
Hiro!

869
01:04:49,895 --> 01:04:51,514
Krei.

870
01:04:55,866 --> 01:04:59,584
That's right, we were
asked to do the impossible.

871
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:01,219
That's what we did.

872
01:05:01,851 --> 01:05:05,807
We re-invented the very
concept of transportation.

873
01:05:05,846 --> 01:05:10,720
Friends, I present,
Project: "Silent Sparrow".

874
01:05:16,406 --> 01:05:19,110
General, may I?

875
01:05:24,498 --> 01:05:27,099
Wow, magic hat.

876
01:05:31,652 --> 01:05:36,506
Teleportation, the transport of matter
spontaneously through space...

877
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,265
Not science fiction anymore.

878
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:45,193
Now, We didn't spend billions of
tax dollars to teleport hats.

879
01:05:45,587 --> 01:05:49,265
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're here to witness history.

880
01:05:49,383 --> 01:05:51,697
Ready to go for a ride, Abigail?

881
01:05:51,758 --> 01:05:53,770
We've invited all these people.

882
01:05:53,835 --> 01:05:55,624
Might as well, give them a show.

883
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:59,300
T minus 30 seconds to launch.

884
01:06:00,061 --> 01:06:00,561
29

885
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:01,791
28

886
01:06:02,179 --> 01:06:03,339
The castle is in position.
27.

887
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:07,229
Sir, we picked up a slight irregularity
in the magnetic containment field.

888
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,626
Mr. Krei, is there a problem?

889
01:06:10,651 --> 01:06:12,533
No! No problem.

890
01:06:12,542 --> 01:06:16,170
It's well within the parameters.
Let's move forward.

891
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:19,861
3... 2... 1...

892
01:06:19,966 --> 01:06:21,666
Abigail.

893
01:06:25,283 --> 01:06:27,254
Field breach, abort!

894
01:06:27,322 --> 01:06:29,434
We lost all contact with the pod!

895
01:06:31,631 --> 01:06:32,576
Oh, no!

896
01:06:32,578 --> 01:06:34,721
- It's breaking up!
- The pilot is gone!

897
01:06:34,819 --> 01:06:36,377
Portal 2 is down.

898
01:06:37,362 --> 01:06:39,081
The magnetic containment field is down!

899
01:06:43,442 --> 01:06:46,077
Krei, shut it down now!

900
01:06:48,785 --> 01:06:50,714
I want this island sealed off!

901
01:06:50,744 --> 01:06:52,690
The Government shutdown
Krei's experiment.

902
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:55,588
And he is using your microbots
to steal his machine back.

903
01:06:55,657 --> 01:06:57,785
Krei is the guy in the mask.

904
01:06:58,019 --> 01:06:59,538
Oh, no!

905
01:07:09,593 --> 01:07:12,378
Baymax, get us out of here.

906
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,530
Go for the transmitter!
Behind his mask!

907
01:07:24,356 --> 01:07:25,749
Baymax!

908
01:07:26,703 --> 01:07:27,961
Okay, what's the plan?

909
01:07:27,998 --> 01:07:29,659
It's fred time.

910
01:07:30,145 --> 01:07:31,655
Super jump!

911
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,430
Gravity Crash!

912
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:35,961
Falling hard!

913
01:07:36,246 --> 01:07:37,635
Seriously, what's the plan?

914
01:07:37,657 --> 01:07:39,039
Get the mask!

915
01:07:39,089 --> 01:07:40,177
Right behind you.

916
01:07:40,246 --> 01:07:42,182
For real, what is the plan?

917
01:08:14,317 --> 01:08:15,561
Hey!

918
01:08:21,028 --> 01:08:22,340
Hey!

919
01:08:24,742 --> 01:08:27,246
You want to dance, masked man?

920
01:08:27,443 --> 01:08:29,157
You'll be dance with this.

921
01:08:29,209 --> 01:08:32,192
Hand over the mask or
your gonna taste of this!

922
01:08:32,265 --> 01:08:33,265
And a little bit of that!

923
01:08:33,832 --> 01:08:34,332
Ahah!

924
01:08:39,097 --> 01:08:39,597
Wooh!

925
01:08:39,768 --> 01:08:41,840
Hey, I did alright.

926
01:08:42,272 --> 01:08:44,066
Is that all you got?

927
01:08:44,385 --> 01:08:46,695
Oh, you got that too?

928
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:50,353
Get back into the fire!

929
01:09:22,649 --> 01:09:24,161
It's over, Krei.

930
01:09:31,719 --> 01:09:33,687
Professor Callaghan?

931
01:09:35,814 --> 01:09:37,585
The Explosions.

932
01:09:38,358 --> 01:09:39,395
You died.

933
01:09:39,477 --> 01:09:42,343
No! I had yourmicrobots.

934
01:09:44,981 --> 01:09:47,726
But, Tadashi...

935
01:09:47,868 --> 01:09:49,307
You just let him die.

936
01:09:49,382 --> 01:09:51,349
Give me the mask, Hiro.

937
01:09:51,385 --> 01:09:54,810
- He went in there to save you.
- That was his mistake!

938
01:09:59,768 --> 01:10:02,764
Baymax, destroy!

939
01:10:03,544 --> 01:10:06,313
My programming prevents
me from injuring a human being.

940
01:10:06,385 --> 01:10:07,967
Not anymore.

941
01:10:11,817 --> 01:10:13,873
Hiro, this is not what..

942
01:10:17,025 --> 01:10:19,873
Do it Baymax!
Destroy him!

943
01:10:24,527 --> 01:10:26,616
No! Stop, Baymax!

944
01:10:37,928 --> 01:10:40,276
No, stop!
His getting away!

945
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:46,563
Baymax!

946
01:11:10,893 --> 01:11:13,838
My health care protocol has been violated.

947
01:11:19,238 --> 01:11:22,047
I regret any distress I made have caused.

948
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:24,533
How could you do that?
I had him!

949
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:27,659
What you just did,
we never signed up for.

950
01:11:27,711 --> 01:11:31,157
We said, we catch the guy.
That's it!

951
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:33,281
I never should've let you help me!

952
01:11:33,356 --> 01:11:35,821
Baymax, find Callaghan!

953
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:40,305
My enhanced scanner has been damaged.

954
01:11:42,472 --> 01:11:43,884
Wings!

955
01:11:44,625 --> 01:11:47,360
- Hiro, this isn't part of the plan.
- Fly!

956
01:11:47,665 --> 01:11:49,559
Hiro!

957
01:12:06,932 --> 01:12:09,275
Your blood pressure is elevated.

958
01:12:09,311 --> 01:12:11,442
You appear to be distress.

959
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,037
I'm fine.

960
01:12:14,717 --> 01:12:16,689
There, is it working?

961
01:12:19,186 --> 01:12:21,291
My sensor is operational.

962
01:12:21,384 --> 01:12:23,475
Good, let's get...

963
01:12:24,242 --> 01:12:25,460
What?

964
01:12:25,656 --> 01:12:28,078
Are you going to remove
my health care chip?

965
01:12:28,097 --> 01:12:29,526
Yes, open...

966
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:32,210
My purpose is to heal,
the sick and injured.

967
01:12:32,299 --> 01:12:34,359
Baymax, open your access port.

968
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:36,518
Do you want me to terminate
Professor Callaghan?

969
01:12:36,531 --> 01:12:38,640
Just open!

970
01:12:41,176 --> 01:12:44,904
Will terminating Professor Callaghan,
improve your emotional state?

971
01:12:44,932 --> 01:12:48,213
Yes! No! I don't know!
Open your access...

972
01:12:48,241 --> 01:12:50,906
- Is this what Tadashi wanted?
- It doesn't matter!

973
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:54,381
- Tadashi programmed me to aid...
- Tadashi's gone!

974
01:12:58,863 --> 01:13:02,011
Tadashi's gone.

975
01:13:02,684 --> 01:13:04,778
Tadashi is here.

976
01:13:04,897 --> 01:13:08,391
No, he is not here.

977
01:13:08,531 --> 01:13:10,936
Tadashi is here.

978
01:13:11,766 --> 01:13:14,632
This is Tadashi Hamada.

979
01:13:15,227 --> 01:13:19,252
And this is the first test of
my robotics project.

980
01:13:19,298 --> 01:13:21,438
Hello! I am Baymax.

981
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:22,937
Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!

982
01:13:25,537 --> 01:13:28,576
The seventh's test of my robotics project.

983
01:13:28,662 --> 01:13:30,187
Hello, I am...

984
01:13:32,993 --> 01:13:35,130
Wait! Wait, Stop! Stop scan!
Stop!

985
01:13:35,782 --> 01:13:38,129
Tadashi Hamada again.

986
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:42,718
And this is a 33rd test
of my robotics project.

987
01:13:49,127 --> 01:13:51,175
I'm not giving up on you.

988
01:13:51,241 --> 01:13:55,327
You don't understand this yet, but people
need you, so let's get back to work.

989
01:13:57,643 --> 01:14:03,216
This is ah... Tadashi Hamada,
and this is a the 84th test...

990
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,812
What do you say big guy?

991
01:14:06,834 --> 01:14:11,293
Hello, I am Baymax your personal
health care companion.

992
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:12,572
It works!

993
01:14:12,821 --> 01:14:13,840
It works!

994
01:14:13,846 --> 01:14:17,069
Oh, this is amazing!
It work!

995
01:14:17,172 --> 01:14:20,450
I knew it, I knew it!
I knew it, I knew it!

996
01:14:20,464 --> 01:14:22,441
It worked, I can't believe!
I can't...

997
01:14:22,504 --> 01:14:25,369
Okay! Alright! Big moment here.

998
01:14:25,782 --> 01:14:27,178
Scan me.

999
01:14:28,533 --> 01:14:31,524
Your neurotransmitter levels are elevated.

1000
01:14:31,562 --> 01:14:33,745
This indicates that you are happy.

1001
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,720
I am, I really am...

1002
01:14:36,770 --> 01:14:40,574
Oh man! Wait my brother sees you.

1003
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:43,200
You're gonna help so many people buddy.

1004
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:44,784
So many.

1005
01:14:44,787 --> 01:14:49,001
That's all for now
I am satisfied with my care.

1006
01:14:58,914 --> 01:15:00,842
Thank you, Baymax.

1007
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:06,352
I'm so sorry.

1008
01:15:07,454 --> 01:15:09,647
I guess I'm not like my brother.

1009
01:15:10,227 --> 01:15:11,585
Hiro.

1010
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:18,243
Guys, I...

1011
01:15:21,761 --> 01:15:24,189
We are going to catch Callaghan.

1012
01:15:24,276 --> 01:15:27,174
And this time, we'll do it right.

1013
01:15:28,881 --> 01:15:32,621
Hey! But maybe don't leave your team
stranded on a spooky island next time.

1014
01:15:33,049 --> 01:15:34,294
Oh, man!

1015
01:15:34,384 --> 01:15:37,698
Nah! It's cool! Heathcliff picked
us up in a family chopper.

1016
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:40,870
Hiro, we found something
you should see.

1017
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:46,043
You almost got us all killed.

1018
01:15:46,116 --> 01:15:50,672
Krei! You did this!
You knew it wasn't ready!

1019
01:15:50,858 --> 01:15:53,465
Callaghan?
He was there?

1020
01:15:53,503 --> 01:15:56,294
He was such a good man.
What happened?

1021
01:15:56,393 --> 01:16:00,153
I don't know, but the answers
here somewhere.

1022
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:02,250
Wait! Wait, stop!

1023
01:16:02,362 --> 01:16:04,007
There is!

1024
01:16:04,979 --> 01:16:07,004
With the pilot?

1025
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:10,594
Hang on!

1026
01:16:11,839 --> 01:16:14,922
We've invited all these people.
We'll see.

1027
01:16:16,731 --> 01:16:18,822
The pilot was Callaghan's daughter!

1028
01:16:18,864 --> 01:16:23,518
- Callaghan blames Krei!
- This is a revenge story!

1029
01:16:23,723 --> 01:16:25,686
So what are we waiting for?

1030
01:16:32,668 --> 01:16:37,342
This beautiful new campus is the
culmination of a life long dream.

1031
01:16:37,913 --> 01:16:42,623
But none of these would have been possible
without a few bumps on the road.

1032
01:16:42,809 --> 01:16:45,061
Those setbacks, made us stronger...

1033
01:16:45,143 --> 01:16:48,961
and set us on the path
to a bright future!

1034
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:51,718
What?

1035
01:16:51,796 --> 01:16:53,245
Setback?

1036
01:17:05,017 --> 01:17:07,632
Why is my daughter a setback?

1037
01:17:07,688 --> 01:17:10,260
Callaghan.
But you...

1038
01:17:10,839 --> 01:17:13,643
Your daughter, that was an accident.

1039
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:14,906
No!

1040
01:17:14,939 --> 01:17:16,828
You knew it was unsafe!

1041
01:17:16,865 --> 01:17:20,349
My daughter is gone because
of your arrogance.

1042
01:17:32,016 --> 01:17:33,330
What are you doing?

1043
01:17:33,336 --> 01:17:37,673
You took everything from me when you
send Abigail on that machine.

1044
01:17:38,141 --> 01:17:41,206
Now I'm taking everything from you.

1045
01:17:46,849 --> 01:17:49,065
No! No! You can't.

1046
01:17:56,184 --> 01:18:00,473
You are going to watch everything
you built disappeared...

1047
01:18:00,546 --> 01:18:02,032
and then it's your turn.

1048
01:18:02,087 --> 01:18:03,744
Professor Callaghan!

1049
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:10,086
Let him go!

1050
01:18:11,801 --> 01:18:13,583
Is this what Abigail would have wanted?

1051
01:18:13,602 --> 01:18:15,832
Abigail is gone!

1052
01:18:16,321 --> 01:18:20,574
This won't change anything.
Trust me. I know.

1053
01:18:22,855 --> 01:18:27,711
Listen to the kid, Callaghan. Please let
me go. I'll give you anything you want.

1054
01:18:28,156 --> 01:18:31,619
I want my daughter back!

1055
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:36,882
Go for the mask!

1056
01:18:53,427 --> 01:18:54,806
Baymax!

1057
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:56,721
ACTION!
Leaving into action!

1058
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:34,375
Getting a little tight!

1059
01:19:47,931 --> 01:19:49,172
No!

1060
01:19:49,219 --> 01:19:51,259
- Too strong!
- No way out!

1061
01:19:51,304 --> 01:19:53,750
- Hiro! You beat him!
- Help!

1062
01:19:53,908 --> 01:19:56,999
- Hiro! Hiro!
- Hiro! Help!

1063
01:19:58,229 --> 01:20:01,242
That's it! I know how to beat him!

1064
01:20:01,942 --> 01:20:06,444
Listen up, use those big brain of yours,
and think your way around the problem!

1065
01:20:06,618 --> 01:20:09,064
Look for a new angle!

1066
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:24,200
I can't go any further!

1067
01:20:24,728 --> 01:20:27,669
Wait a second, it's a suit!

1068
01:20:28,381 --> 01:20:32,615
Hello, sign.
Care to go for a little spin?

1069
01:20:32,976 --> 01:20:34,354
Double Spin!

1070
01:20:35,342 --> 01:20:36,017
And Back Spin!

1071
01:20:37,941 --> 01:20:39,393
Yeah!

1072
01:20:49,659 --> 01:20:51,224
Baymax!

1073
01:20:56,898 --> 01:20:58,170
Hiro!

1074
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:17,528
I love that robot!

1075
01:21:24,044 --> 01:21:25,903
Okay, new plan.

1076
01:21:25,988 --> 01:21:27,358
Forget the mask.

1077
01:21:27,429 --> 01:21:29,943
Take out the bots, they'll get
sucked up into the portal.

1078
01:21:30,014 --> 01:21:31,552
Now! That is a plan!

1079
01:21:31,603 --> 01:21:35,478
- Honey, Fred, can you give us some cover?
- Like you have to ask.

1080
01:21:35,596 --> 01:21:39,233
- Let's do this Freddie!
- Smoke screen!

1081
01:21:50,737 --> 01:21:52,119
Ready?

1082
01:21:52,354 --> 01:21:53,612
And...

1083
01:21:54,144 --> 01:21:55,513
Dive!

1084
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:05,906
Whoa, gravity is getting
a little weird here guys.

1085
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:08,308
Let's use this!

1086
01:22:11,656 --> 01:22:13,629
Green Blaze of Fury!

1087
01:22:15,488 --> 01:22:17,606
Woman up!

1088
01:22:23,261 --> 01:22:25,076
Triple Sign Spin!

1089
01:22:25,162 --> 01:22:28,046
Now! The signs is on fire!

1090
01:22:34,708 --> 01:22:38,111
Wooo, now that's a chemical reaction!

1091
01:22:40,709 --> 01:22:44,175
Back Kick, Knife Hand, Round house.

1092
01:22:44,409 --> 01:22:45,651
Hammer fist!

1093
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:53,346
This ends now!

1094
01:22:59,376 --> 01:23:01,513
Looks like you're out of microbots.

1095
01:23:01,538 --> 01:23:02,322
What?

1096
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:08,090
Baymax!

1097
01:23:19,498 --> 01:23:23,063
Our programming prevents us
from injuring a human beings.

1098
01:23:23,161 --> 01:23:25,186
But we'll take that.

1099
01:23:56,213 --> 01:23:58,997
It's still on!
We have to shut it down.

1100
01:23:59,037 --> 01:24:03,566
We cant! The containment field is failing,
the portals gonna tear itself apart.

1101
01:24:03,779 --> 01:24:06,033
We need to get out of here now!

1102
01:24:12,073 --> 01:24:13,382
Baymax!

1103
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:15,825
My sensors is detecting signs of life.

1104
01:24:15,864 --> 01:24:18,700
- What?
- Coming from there.

1105
01:24:18,827 --> 01:24:23,263
The life signs are female.
She appears to be in hyper sleep.

1106
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:26,594
Callaghan's daughter.
She is still alive!

1107
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:28,156
Abigail?

1108
01:24:29,506 --> 01:24:30,771
Lets go get her.

1109
01:24:30,862 --> 01:24:34,118
The portal is destabilizing!
You'll never make it.

1110
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:37,677
She's alive in there.
Someone has to help.

1111
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,445
What do you say, buddy?

1112
01:24:40,686 --> 01:24:43,939
Fine, makes me a better
health care companion.

1113
01:25:10,828 --> 01:25:13,396
Careful! There's Krei Tech
debris everywhere!

1114
01:25:31,383 --> 01:25:32,912
Look up!

1115
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:43,228
I have located the patient.

1116
01:25:46,663 --> 01:25:47,945
Hurry!

1117
01:26:05,533 --> 01:26:07,681
Come on, buddy.
Let's get her home.

1118
01:26:12,403 --> 01:26:14,741
I'll guide you out of here. Let's go!

1119
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:22,614
Be right.

1120
01:26:23,141 --> 01:26:25,909
Okay, to the left!

1121
01:26:26,016 --> 01:26:27,652
Har right!

1122
01:26:28,511 --> 01:26:30,287
Up and over!

1123
01:26:31,017 --> 01:26:32,697
Okay, level up!

1124
01:26:32,774 --> 01:26:34,305
Easy.

1125
01:26:35,592 --> 01:26:38,100
Woohoo, nice flying!

1126
01:26:40,102 --> 01:26:41,548
Almost there!

1127
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:48,573
Baymax!

1128
01:26:58,184 --> 01:26:59,750
Baymax!

1129
01:27:07,685 --> 01:27:11,163
- My thrusters are inoperable.
- Just grab hold.

1130
01:27:20,226 --> 01:27:24,217
There is still a way I can
get you both to safety.

1131
01:27:28,485 --> 01:27:31,691
I can not deactivate until you say:
You are satisfied with your care.

1132
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:34,488
No! No, wait!
What about you?

1133
01:27:34,519 --> 01:27:37,814
You are my patient. Baymax!
Your health is my only concern.

1134
01:27:37,839 --> 01:27:41,002
- Stop! No! No, im gonna figure...
- Are you satisfied with your care?

1135
01:27:41,033 --> 01:27:43,363
No, there's gotta be another way.
I'm not gonna

1136
01:27:43,376 --> 01:27:45,717
leave you here. I'll
think of something.

1137
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:47,574
There is no time.

1138
01:27:47,729 --> 01:27:52,334
- Are you satisfied with your care?
- Please, No!

1139
01:27:53,589 --> 01:27:55,607
I can't lose you too.

1140
01:27:55,674 --> 01:27:57,266
Hiro...

1141
01:27:58,317 --> 01:28:00,869
I will always be with you.

1142
01:28:24,681 --> 01:28:27,292
I'm satisfied with my care.

1143
01:29:03,745 --> 01:29:05,113
Hiro!

1144
01:29:05,131 --> 01:29:07,025
Yeah, they made it!

1145
01:29:10,829 --> 01:29:12,440
Baymax?

1146
01:29:29,523 --> 01:29:32,546
Miss, can you hear me?
What is your name?

1147
01:29:32,842 --> 01:29:34,792
Abigail Callaghan.

1148
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:38,593
Okay, Abigail. You're gonna be fine.
We're taking you to the hospital.

1149
01:29:38,682 --> 01:29:41,317
Move in!

1150
01:30:00,221 --> 01:30:04,432
A massive clean-up continues today at the
headquarters of Krei Tech Industry.

1151
01:30:04,450 --> 01:30:08,235
Reports are still flooding in about
a group of unidentified individuals.

1152
01:30:08,283 --> 01:30:11,339
Who prevented what could have been a
major catastrophe.

1153
01:30:11,368 --> 01:30:14,160
The whole city of San
Fransokyo is asking. Whose

1154
01:30:14,173 --> 01:30:16,976
are these heroes? And
where are they now?

1155
01:30:17,045 --> 01:30:18,214
- Hey!
- Hi!

1156
01:30:20,113 --> 01:30:21,625
Hey, sweetie.

1157
01:30:21,668 --> 01:30:22,895
Okay.

1158
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:27,439
Last hug.

1159
01:30:29,387 --> 01:30:30,677
Bye.

1160
01:31:13,487 --> 01:31:15,028
Awww...

1161
01:31:17,756 --> 01:31:21,915
I am Baymax.
Your personal health care companion.

1162
01:31:22,375 --> 01:31:24,047
Hello! Hiro.

1163
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:38,481
We didn't set out to be superheros.

1164
01:31:38,570 --> 01:31:41,670
But sometimes life doesn't go
the way you plan.

1165
01:31:45,685 --> 01:31:48,043
The good thing is, my
brother wanted to help

1166

Dad...

1238
01:40:22,896 --> 01:40:25,757
I just wish I could share my
accomplishments with you.

01:40:25,855 --> 01:40:28,077
You mean so much to me,
and honestly...

1240
01:40:28,121 --> 01:40:30,390
I have always felt the
distance where with you

1241
01:40:30,403 --> 01:40:32,683

01:41:08,010 --> 01:41:12,890
I go inside out, then
I go front and back.

1248
