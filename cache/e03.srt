[People clamoring]

321
00:20:43,102 --> 00:20:44,531
[Man 1] Look. A fight is going on.

322
00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:47,817
Oh man! Beat him.

[Man 3] Beat him!

324
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,342
[Riya] He was trying
to be over smart. Huh?

325
00:21:02,432 --> 00:21:03,800
I will teach you a lesson!

326
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,999
Beat him! Romeo, my foot!

327

[Rudra]<i>For one moment I got unnerved
to see that girl over there.</i>

328
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:22,095
<i>That inner conscience
of right and wrong.</i>

329
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:26,816
<i>But that time I was sure that I'll
become a fraud for a minimal time.</i>

330
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,624
<i>So I stopped
the voice of conscience</i>

331
00:21:31,382 --> 00:21:32,373
<i>and moved ahead.</i>

332
00:21:37,711 --> 00:21:39,632
[Man 1] Beat him! Right! Left!

333
00:21:40,295 --> 00:21:42,121
Someone has taken Anu
inside the room.

334
00:21:42,211 --> 00:21:43,291
Call now. Hurry up.

[Door closes]

337
00:21:52,014 --> 00:21:52,827
What happened?

338
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:55,372
Someone pushed Anu
in the bride's room.

339
00:21:57,175 --> 00:21:58,461
No one's over here.

340
00:22:08,597 --> 00:22:09,981
He's only watching.

341
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:11,973
Tell them to close
all the gates.

turban having a moustache and beard,</i>

344
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:16,275
<i>he shouldn't go out.</i>

345
00:22:16,365 --> 00:22:17,844
Stop the car.

346
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:20,615
- [Man 2] He doesn't have a turban.
- No. No.

347
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:22,789
- [Man 3] Let him go.
- [Man 2] Please go.

[Rudra] <i>Anu is with me.</i>

349
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:04,691
<i>I'll keep you informed.</i>

350
00:23:11,103 --> 00:23:13,411
[Rudra] <i>At that time I didn't
know the truth</i>

351
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,483
<i>that this night will be
the most historic night of my life,</i>

352
00:23:17,408 --> 00:23:19,322
<i>Until today I used to
stop crime.</i>

353
00:23:20,214 --> 00:23:21,911
<i>But now I had committed a crime.</i>

354
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,432
<i>Thus we three went towards
the path of my destruction.</i>

355
00:23:26,457 --> 00:23:27,587
<i>Yes, three of us.</i>

356
00:23:27,677 --> 00:23:29,145
Can't I take the window seat?

357
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:31,335
- [Rudra] <i>Me, the girl...</i>
- No.

358
00:23:31,425 --> 00:23:32,824
<i>...and my bad luck.</i>
