1
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:07,151
So, we built a machine
powerful enough to big-bang

2
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:08,510
a new Speed Force into existence,

3
00:00:08,593 --> 00:00:12,555
based solely on the teachings
of history's most evil speedster.

4
00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:15,684
Are we sure we wanna hit this switch?

5
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:28,445
Do it.

6
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:05,358
Uh, what's happening?

7
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:14,784
It didn't work.

8
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:37,682
Guys, you in there?

9
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,269
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

10
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:45,190
- Oh, um, how did the machine test go?
- Well, it didn't.

11
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,483
That's the problem.

12
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:48,359
How did Thawne manage to build

13
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:51,571
a Speed Force machine on his own
without a journal to guide him,

14
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:55,450
but all the brainpower in S.T.A.R. Labs
can't even get this thing to work?

15
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,369
It's like we built a 12-ton paperweight.

16
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:00,538
Okay, okay, but, hey, uh,

17
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:03,458
maybe getting out of here for a minute
might clear your heads.

18
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:07,921
I myself was on my way over to
<i>The Citizen</i> right now. Does anybody...

19
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:10,507
Barry, wanna come with me?

20
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:14,552
No. Look, every day
that the machine is off

21
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:16,471
is another day I can't
protect this city.

22
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:17,889
I have to keep working.

23
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:22,602
Barry, wait.

24
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,870
Are you sure you don't want to see Iris?

25
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,111
Can I tell her anything for you?

26
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:35,907
Tell her I miss her.

27
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:46,251
His speed has been draining nonstop.
Your plan was a success.

28
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,169
You've done an amazing job.

29
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,131
Is everything okay?

30
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:53,841
You seem...

31
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:55,801
distant.

32
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,053
Sorry, um...

33
00:02:57,971 --> 00:03:00,974
I'd just like to know if you want us
to proceed with the next phase.

34
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:02,057
Yes.

35
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:04,519
Go join your brother and prepare,

36
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:09,399
because tonight,
I will finally have my liberation.

37
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:11,752
- Success is assured.
- Success is assured.

38
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:16,864
Come in.

39
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,451
- Hey, you busy?
- Hey, what's up?

40
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,995
I just wanted to...

41
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:31,045
You're here about me and Barry?

42
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,130
Yeah.

43
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,552
He's in a really bad place, Iris.

44
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:41,723
His heart is breaking.
He won't talk to anybody about it.

45
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,576
He promised me after he took Nora
to the future,

46
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,809
that would be the last time

47
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:47,437
that he made a decision
about our family without me.

48
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:50,040
But then he took my dad into WITSEC
and didn't even tell me.

49
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,566
I had to find out from Singh.

50
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,610
How do you get over that, Cecile?

51
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:54,985
Well...

52
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:57,071
I don't really know, Iris,

53
00:03:57,155 --> 00:04:00,491
but I would think
the first step is wanting to.

54
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:02,619
What do you want?

55
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:13,755
I... I don't know.

56
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:20,345
Can you feel what I want?

57
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:23,014
Can you tell me?

58
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:33,608
You feel... sad.

59
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,362
Sad and concerned.

60
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,323
I think what Iris needs right now
is space

61
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:42,992
to focus on what's really important.

62
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:46,454
Right, uh...

63
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:50,875
It's important for me to take care
of myself right now, Cecile.

64
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:54,963
Okay, yeah, um...

65
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:00,259
Your husband wanted me to tell you
that he misses you.

66
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:15,357
Barr?

67
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:17,753
- Hey.
- There's something blocking the door.

68
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:18,777
Yeah, um...

69
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,214
I thought you were still
at the speed lab.

70
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:21,238
Uh...

71
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:23,616
- Hey, Barry...
- Hold on.

72
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,411
- Why can't I get inside my own house?
- Sorry. Hold on.

73
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,329
- Give me a sec, okay?
- Geez.

74
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:34,544
Cecile, I can explain.

75
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,047
What the hell is this?

76
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:41,342
Iris isn't Iris.

77
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:49,099
Okay, so then I thought, well,

78
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,370
obviously this can't be
an Iris doppelgänger from another Earth,

79
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:52,955
because doppelgängers
don't exist anymore,

80
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:54,540
because the multi-verse
doesn't exist anymore,

81
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:56,816
- because Crisis blew it all up, right?
- Uh-huh.

82
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,526
Exactly. So, if that's true,

83
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:00,629
who else do we know
that could be pretending to be Iris?

84
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,488
- I... But...
- Shapeshifters.

85
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:04,216
All right, so Everyman
was my first suspect.

86
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,743
And Cisco's reports show
that he is alive, post-Crisis.

87
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:09,829
Then, I remembered something
that Breacher said about Plastoids,

88
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:10,955
which made me realize...

89
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,583
there could be shapeshifting Martians
on this Earth now.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,502
This... This fake Iris doesn't even
have to be from our planet.

91
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:17,670
But then, it hit me

92
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:20,474
that J'onn J'onzz would sense
if there was a Martian hidden among us,

93
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:21,549
so that was a dead end,

94
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:23,676
but it led me
to my biggest breakthrough yet.

95
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,761
Okay, Cecile.

96
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:28,890
The night that this all started,
Iris left to investigate a story.

97
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:32,810
I analyzed her phone's GPS, and it shows
that she went to McCulloch Tech.

98
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:37,023
Cecile, I think that something happened
to Iris that night.

99
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:40,358
Barry.

100
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,780
All of this, is this the reason
you've been avoiding Iris?

101
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:46,407
That's not Iris!
Okay, look, I didn't want to...

102
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,535
tell anyone else about this
until I gathered more evidence,

103
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:51,746
but now you know, so I...

104
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,039
What do you think?

105
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,458
Uh...

106
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:00,129
What do I think? What do I think?
I think... I think that this sounds...

107
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,215
I know how it sounds,
but look, we've seen crazier.

108
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:04,068
We've seen crazier.
And look at all the clues.

109
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,385
Okay, I mean, she speaks Italian,
all of a sudden.

110
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:08,304
She smashed a bottle
over some guy's head.

111
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:09,547
She made incredible pancakes.

112
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:12,183
Cecile, trust me.
Iris can't make pancakes.

113
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:14,602
All right? But the biggest clue was...

114
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:17,271
her throwing me out.

115
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:21,692
The real Iris would never
stop fighting for us.

116
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:25,196
Okay. Okay, uh...

117
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:30,618
Sweetie, do you think
that maybe, just maybe...

118
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,329
you're feeling a little scared?

119
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,957
You know, because your marriage
is going through a rough patch,

120
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,753
and maybe what you need to do
is just go see Iris.

121
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:43,047
That's not Ir... Cecile, look.

122
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:45,296
Do you know why
my Speed Gauge is still glowing red?

123
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,221
It is because the moment
that I stepped out of the loft,

124
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:54,183
I realized Iris, the real Iris, my wife,

125
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:57,937
she is somewhere else,
probably in danger.

126
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,940
And if that's true,
I need my speed back,

127
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,235
my lightning, all my powers,
if I'm gonna save her.

128
00:08:06,154 --> 00:08:07,714
It's all I've thought about ever since.

129
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:11,200
No matter how insane this all sounds...

130
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:17,915
I know in my heart that the real Iris
is out there somewhere,

131
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,543
waiting for me to find her.

132
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,670
I won't let her down.

133
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:32,972
Polar bear's a little on-the-nose,
don't you think?

134
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,283
Well, it's not like the stores have

135
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:36,934
a "get well soon from
dual light-assassin attacks" card.

136
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:39,227
What'd you bring?

137
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:40,521
I got a mobile bio-lab,

138
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:42,940
so she can catch up on her work
while she recovers in bed.

139
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,360
Don't be jealous.
It's a scientist thing.

140
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:48,779
Come on, snowpoke. It's us.

141
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:55,912
It's ice-cold.

142
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,670
Caitlin.

143
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:07,465
Help me.

144
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:14,075
Since when is Caitlin the frosty one?

145
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:19,685
She's not.

146
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:23,898
Hang on, Caitlin. We're on the case.

147
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:32,281
I think I've come up with a new idea
to get us out of this place.

148
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:38,287
Stop! What are you doing?

149
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:39,454
Eva, think about it.

150
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,374
This is the only mirror
that you can control,

151
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,709
so there's gotta be something
different about it.

152
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:48,881
And until we can figure out what that
is, we're just working blind. Move.

153
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:52,176
So, to examine it, you want to smash it?

154
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:55,596
Yeah. I mean, we both know
that you can put it back together,

155
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,640
so let's just take this thing down,

156
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:00,559
dissect it piece-by-piece,
and learn what its secrets are.

157
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:04,480
Fine. You do what you wanna do.

158
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:08,676
I'm gonna go to my lab,

159
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:11,570
and work on a plan
that would actually help us.

160
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,398
Oh, my God.

161
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:52,445
Can you, uh, maybe hurry up?

162
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:55,281
You know, when Iris gave me a spare key,
it was to water her plants.

163
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,466
It wasn't to hack her computer.

164
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,118
It's not hacking Iris' computer
if it's not really Iris.

165
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:00,679
What are you even looking for, anyway?

166
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:03,831
Anything that might be suspicious
from the past few weeks.

167
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,753
- Bingo.
- What'd you find?

168
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:10,545
This photo.

169
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,506
It was deleted from Kamilla's camera,

170
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,009
but not before it was uploaded
to <i>The Citizen's</i> cloud server.

171
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,218
Do you see this text?

172
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,471
"Prismatic Filter."

173
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:20,472
What is that?

174
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:24,810
It's the science that we're gonna use
to test our imposter's identity.

175
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,313
Expose her for good.

176
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,076
That's better. Much more homey.

177
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,370
"Closer" is how I'd describe it.

178
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,372
Closer to our Mother.

179
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,041
It's time for our next move.

180
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,294
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

181
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:52,712
Are you?

182
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,799
Yes.

183
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,636
All that matters is Eva's will.

184
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,972
We follow orders and assure her success.

185
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:03,349
That's all I want.

186
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:05,309
We need to focus.

187
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:08,479
There's still one item Mother needs
to obtain for her liberation.

188
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:11,678
<i>And it's the most dangerous yet.</i>

189
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,399
Hey, I saw your text.

190
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,874
I got here as fast as I could.
What's the emergency?

191
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:34,046
You are, apparently.

192
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
What's going on?

193
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:43,931
You're not Iris. That's what.

194
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,601
And you're not leaving here
until you tell us who or what you are.

195
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,983
What the hell are you talking about?

196
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,612
And why are you pointing
that gauntlet at me?

197
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:05,953
This photo was taken on
Kamilla's camera.

198
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,330
You see the prismatic fragmentation?

199
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,041
Only your image is affected.

200
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,546
I think that the camera's filter
is revealing a dimensional shift,

201
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,674
showing us things in the picture
from another dimension.

202
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,135
Things that don't belong in ours.

203
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:28,058
Cecile, you actually believe this?

204
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:32,813
You seemed off in your office earlier,
and that photo...

205
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:35,608
That could have been anything!
A glitch in the camera tech.

206
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,276
Guys, this is insane.

207
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,782
This Prismatic Scanner is just a more
powerful version of the camera's filter.

208
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,244
If I'm wrong,
and you are from this dimension,

209
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:50,498
then when the prismatic wave hits you,
you'll look completely normal.

210
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:55,544
But if I'm right,
you're gonna look just like that photo.

211
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:00,049
And you're gonna tell us
where the real Iris is.

212
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,094
Barry, how could you do this?

213
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,806
For God's sake, I'm your wife.

214
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:21,861
Okay.

215
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:24,782
You wanna see who I really am?

216
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:27,784
Fine.

217
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,412
I'll show you.

218
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,663
No.

219
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,873
I have to know. I have to know.

220
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,148
<i>Someone else must have heard
the good news, too,</i>

221
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,465
<i>because they sent you a gift.</i>

222
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:24,675
<i>I had it delivered.</i>

223
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,143
<i>Hello, Joseph.</i>

224
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,729
<i>This is your last chance, Joseph.</i>

225
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:38,355
<i>Threats are for real people, Eva.</i>

226
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:42,234
<i>Not phantoms.
Because that's what you are</i>.

227
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:48,240
<i>And no one saw you?</i>

228
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:53,012
- <i>Thank God you're safe.
- I'm not. Neither are you.</i>

229
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:54,955
<i>Black Hole isn't what we think.</i>

230
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,290
<i>Mirror.</i>

231
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:16,185
Shh.

232
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:18,978
I know.

233
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:22,566
The truth hurts.

234
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,239
Barry.

235
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:35,829
I just want you to know
that if anything happens, I...

236
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,539
I forgive you.

237
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,687
What's happening?

238
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:02,773
Nothing.

239
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,067
Okay, okay. That's enough.

240
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,503
No, something...
something's wrong, all right?

241
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:07,727
Just... Just give it a minute.

242
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,410
Look...

243
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:15,953
I don't know how she did this,

244
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,622
but you have to see
that this isn't my wife.

245
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:20,082
No. You're not my husband, Barry.

246
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:23,961
And you wanna know
what the real test is?

247
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,673
The real Barry would have fought harder.
He would have fought to come back home.

248
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,342
A whole week went by,
and you never even tried.

249
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,600
You used to say
that I was your lightning rod.

250
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,460
Now let's see if you're still mine.

251
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,256
Guys...

252
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:14,594
I'm me.

253
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:18,764
I... I'm the real Barry.

254
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:20,100
- Hey.
- Wait! Nash, no.

255
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:21,852
Back up.

256
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,146
Cecile.

257
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:31,904
You believe me?

258
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:34,948
Yes. I do.

259
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:42,831
And I'm sorry.

260
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:49,546
I'm sorry, Barry. I'm... I'm sorry.

261
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,768
<i>Nash! Cecile!</i>

262
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,145
<i>Don't listen to her. That's not Iris!</i>

263
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:09,066
You know, you can stop playing this game
or rot in there, I don't care.

264
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,527
Either way, I'm gonna find my husband.

265
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:14,506
Ah, I should've noticed something.
I should've figured something out.

266
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,130
- I should've...
- No. No one's to blame.

267
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:19,618
He or it was pretty convincing.

268
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:22,120
If that's not Barry, then what is he?

269
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:25,624
He's like some mirror version
of himself.

270
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,629
Guys, Joseph Carver.

271
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,508
Wait. You think that...

272
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:38,178
this is related to Black Hole
and their reflective-chip technology?

273
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
Yeah.

274
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:42,992
- I don't know. That seems almost...
- No, it's possible.

275
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:46,019
I've seen the McCulloch tech up close,

276
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:49,898
and reflective-chip technology,
it's far-reaching, to say the least.

277
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,320
Okay. Well, um,
then this might be our best lead.

278
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:57,614
Why don't you see what you can find,
Nash?

279
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:01,034
I will regroup with Kamilla
and do some digging of our own.

280
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,414
Are you okay, Cecile?

281
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:07,832
Um...

282
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,751
Yeah. No, um...

283
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,881
Something just doesn't feel right.

284
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,262
Yeah. No, I understand, um...

285
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:21,823
But we're gonna get
to the bottom of this

286
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:25,100
and get the real Barry back. I promise.

287
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,358
Caitlin's body essentially
self-induced an ice coma

288
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:34,610
to force her to hibernate.

289
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:37,237
She's like a cold battery.
We just need to wake her up.

290
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:38,614
That's where you come in.

291
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,617
Since we don't have
any ionized conductive wiring,

292
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,577
you'll have to be the jumper cables.

293
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,161
Got it.

294
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:47,455
Okay.

295
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,523
Ralph, are you all right?

296
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:15,691
Is she good?

297
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:22,532
Cisco, is she okay? Did it work?

298
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,037
Ah...

299
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:31,458
Oh, thank Elsa.

300
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:34,877
Welcome back.

301
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:36,671
Thanks.

302
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,358
You scared us for
a minute, there.

303
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:39,382
Yeah.

304
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:41,083
Can you tell us what happened?

305
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:42,719
I was home alone,

306
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,806
and the wound from the light bullet
was getting worse.

307
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,825
I'm sure your run-in
with Sunshine didn't help.

308
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:51,561
Yeah. So I tried to ice-heal it,
and that's when the wound ruptured.

309
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,690
It must have been my immune system's
way of protecting me.

310
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:00,070
- Guys, I need help.
- You just tell us what you need.

311
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:06,034
I mean, who do we know who can help
with a light... ice wound?

312
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,578
There's only one person we can call.

313
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:10,914
My mother.

314
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,337
Here she comes.

315
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,200
Everything went according to plan?

316
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:24,344
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.
Everything went as planned.

317
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:27,657
You guys go to the rendezvous.

318
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,307
I'll handle this
and I'll meet you there.

319
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:42,654
I've been watching Barry Allen.
He's planning on exposing you.

320
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,366
- Tell me what to do.
- Go. Meet him.

321
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,285
Leave the rest to me.

322
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:51,621
You're not Iris.

323
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:55,375
And you're not leaving here
until you tell us who or what you are.

324
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:02,591
Now, let's get what we came for.

325
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,652
One of the benefits
of being Chief of Police

326
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,156
is I can request prisoner interviews.

327
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:07,804
Even for press.

328
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:43,632
Well, if it isn't Kamilla Hwang,
Chief Singh...

329
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,220
and Iris West-Allen.

330
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:50,931
To what do I owe the honor?

331
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:52,933
If you help us,
we can get you out of there.

332
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:55,477
And why would I trust
the wife of the Flash?

333
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:58,897
Because I'm not Iris West-Allen.
I'm a reflection of her.

334
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,982
We're all reflections.

335
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:05,028
Faster, stronger than our human
counterparts whose faces we share.

336
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,948
And our only will
is to serve our Mother.

337
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:18,125
The real Iris would never
offer to release me.

338
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,127
Tell me more about your Mother.

339
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,295
Eva McCulloch. She was the sci...

340
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,674
I am a scientist.
I know who Eva McCulloch is.

341
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:27,717
But she disappeared years ago.

342
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:31,471
She's been trapped in another dimension,
a mirror one,

343
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,473
and she needs something from you.

344
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:37,102
You need my blood. How grand.

345
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:41,523
Even in here, fate continues to cast me
in the role of savior.

346
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,941
We just need one drop.

347
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,819
But you need to decide now.

348
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:53,785
I accept.

349
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:56,204
Release me, and you shall indeed
have my lifeblood.

350
00:24:56,872 --> 00:25:00,667
However, this is no crude
meta-cell in Iron Heights.

351
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,502
How do you propose to disrupt

352
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:06,464
a bio-degenerative containment matrix
with triplicate backup protocols?

353
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,716
Mother has a theory.

354
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:10,135
I am the answer.

355
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:12,428
Wait.

356
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:16,349
You'll die.

357
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:20,353
Then it is Eva's will.

358
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:41,041
Code zero. Facility-wide power failure,
all levels. Check the cells.

359
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,211
We have 60 seconds
until the guards arrive...

360
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:11,071
You're almost human...

361
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,074
Maybe something more.

362
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,244
You follow your Master Eva's will,

363
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:21,665
but I see hesitation in your eyes.

364
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:25,126
You have a modicum of will.

365
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:28,505
Are you planning to trick me?

366
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:29,756
Tell me now!

367
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,843
What do you want?

368
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:36,179
- Only Eva's will.
- Lies!

369
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:38,265
Last chance.

370
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,142
What do you want?

371
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:45,397
To be alive.

372
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:51,319
And you're worthy of it.

373
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:05,208
<i>Power restored.
Cell containment re-initialized.</i>

374
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,532
What are you doing?

375
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,269
We had a plan. Don't you want to escape?

376
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:14,718
There are walls beyond these walls.
I was never gonna just walk out of here.

377
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:18,930
But there's more than one way
for me to be free.

378
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:23,059
Let's just call this... the long game.

379
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:39,491
Now, go.

380
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:42,829
I'll stay here and cover our tracks.
Now.

381
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:50,462
Run, Iris. Run!

382
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,440
Cecile?

383
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,276
I don't have all the facts...

384
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,000
and the ones I do have tell me
that you're not who you say you are.

385
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:22,327
But you are Barry.
I know it in my heart.

386
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:26,956
And I'm willing to bet my life on it.

387
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,001
Now go get Iris back.

388
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:37,926
Good work.

389
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:40,261
You'll apply Ramsey's blood
on your side of the mirror.

390
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:43,723
Once it is fully absorbed,
I will activate the R-CEM on my side.

391
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:46,601
Together, they will reconfigure
the molecular stability

392
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,979
of the dimensional barrier
that burns organic matter,

393
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:52,399
creating a safe passageway
between the two worlds.

394
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:56,736
Next time I speak to you,
I will be standing right next to you...

395
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:01,449
- liberated.
- Success is assured.

396
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,372
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

397
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:12,544
Where's my wife?

398
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,803
I'll ask you one more time.
Where's my wife?

399
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:26,432
What are you doing?

400
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:39,863
I saw everything.
You targeted me from the very beginning.

401
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:42,240
You suffered a fraction of my pain.

402
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:46,453
But in just a few, I will be liberated.

403
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:50,373
Barry is gonna stop you. We both will.

404
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,086
I used to think my love
gives me strength, too.

405
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,464
The mirror showed me the truth.

406
00:29:58,089 --> 00:29:59,632
Let me do the same for you.

407
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:29,454
She says you're always
gonna be in her way...

408
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:31,664
and now you're too slow to stop me.

409
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:34,542
Whose way? Who is making you do this?

410
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,663
You should really
mind your surroundings.

411
00:31:58,293 --> 00:31:59,752
Where's my wife?

412
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,879
She's all you can think about, huh?

413
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:06,342
What do you think about me, Barry?

414
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,846
All those days...

415
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,181
weeks.

416
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,559
It wasn't her, it was me.

417
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,687
Enjoying meals together.

418
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,150
Talking about our day.

419
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:28,239
- Sharing your bed.
- Shut up.

420
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:34,871
I am going to kill you.

421
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:39,500
Unlikely. I have been working
on this plan for half a decade.

422
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,794
This is my creation.

423
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:45,715
She is me and I am her.
What she feels, I feel...

424
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:47,634
and we cannot lose.

425
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:55,391
Do they feel what you feel for Carver?

426
00:32:56,893 --> 00:32:57,893
What?

427
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,021
Do they still love him?

428
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:03,149
I don't love my husband.
I want to end him.

429
00:33:03,274 --> 00:33:05,693
Then why do you still call him
your husband?

430
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:08,655
You are just as blinded
as you were before,

431
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:11,699
and he is going to trick you
in the exact same way.

432
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:14,035
- Stop talking.
- Because you still love him.

433
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:15,203
No, I don't!

434
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,136
Your brilliant mind couldn't figure out
that he didn't care about you.

435
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:33,221
Shut up!

436
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:42,021
How long did you sit here, Eva,
pining for rescue...

437
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:44,440
before you realized
that you had been abandoned?

438
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:49,070
I hate him! I want him to suffer!
Suffer! Suffer!

439
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:52,198
Suffer! Suffer!

440
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:53,950
Suffer!

441
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:56,411
Suffer! Suffer!

442
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:58,537
Iris?

443
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:02,417
Suffer! Suffer! Suffer!

444
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:03,626
Suffer!

445
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:05,670
Suffer.

446
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,005
Iris.

447
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:13,721
I won't fight you.
I won't fight you anymore.

448
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,015
You were made from Iris.

449
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:23,604
Part of her heart is inside you.

450
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:25,565
I've seen you be kind.

451
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:27,108
I've seen you laugh.

452
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:30,111
I know that wasn't all a lie.

453
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:36,617
You can be more than this.

454
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:41,247
Not Iris...

455
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:43,915
Yourself.

456
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,588
You have to want it.

457
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:55,969
No.

458
00:34:58,014 --> 00:34:59,557
You have to choose it.

459
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,399
I choose me.

460
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:22,997
Go find Iris.

461
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:26,292
Go find her, Barry.

462
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:29,002
Go save Iris.

463
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:32,339
Go.

464
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,057
Hey...

465
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:54,152
Barry.

466
00:35:56,447 --> 00:35:57,740
I feel alive.

467
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,082
I feel alive.

468
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:41,909
Look what you made me do.

469
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,176
No! I'm sorry!

470
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:03,681
This didn't have to be like this, Flash.

471
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,184
You don't know what it's like in there.

472
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:08,895
I had to get out.

473
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,061
Iris.

474
00:37:11,147 --> 00:37:12,063
Where...

475
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,274
Where is she?

476
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:15,735
She's still in the world
I left behind.

477
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:18,029
Along with the rest
of my insurance policy,

478
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:20,781
Chief Singh and your friend, Kamilla.

479
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:24,911
They're safe. How long is up to you.

480
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:28,664
So, what...

481
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:31,334
now you're gonna kill me?

482
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:35,755
There's no need for that.

483
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:38,633
You're wounded.

484
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,552
You lost your speed...

485
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,555
and your healing
is not what it used to be.

486
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:47,850
You're not much of a threat, are you?

487
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:55,483
You just stay out of my way, Flash,
and I'll stay out of yours.

488
00:37:57,818 --> 00:38:00,571
I have unfinished business
to attend to...

489
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:08,955
and a whole world to liberate.

490
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:43,864
Thank God.

491
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,501
Iris, I...

492
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:43,632
I don't know if it's crazy to think
that you can hear me.

493
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:48,888
I guess right now,
I just need to believe it.

494
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:57,980
I miss you...

495
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:01,734
so much.

496
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:33,057
I know you probably can't hear me,
Barry, but...

497
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:38,979
being away from you
hurts more and more every day.

498
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,361
But I still have hope,

499
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:49,949
because I know that you are out there,
fighting to get me back home.

500
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:53,327
If you can hear me...

501
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,875
I guess I just need you to know that...

502
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:03,170
I love you.

503
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,552
And that love is constant.

504
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,346
Across dimensions...

505
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,891
Across time.

506
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:21,105
To the end of the world and back.

507
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:25,693
And if I know you...

508
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:31,031
I know you aren't just fighting
to find your own way home.

509
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:34,577
And I'm gonna find Kamilla,

510
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:37,288
and I'm gonna find Singh.

511
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:42,042
But most of all...

512
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:44,628
I'm gonna get you back.

513
00:41:44,712 --> 00:41:46,630
I'm gonna find my way back to you.
