1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,640
Sara can never find out
the truth about Ava.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,840
- I'm a...
- You're a clone.

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,000
- Future clone thing?
- The first totem bearers imprisoned

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,160
a great evil.

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,080
And time is his cage.

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,360
If you cannot defeat me
in this vessel,

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,840
how will you stop me
once I've assumed my true form?

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,320
Our family's destruction
looms in 1992.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,040
You promised you'd save us.

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,720
Auasa.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,160
Gideon, set a course.

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,000
I have to save my family.

14
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,360
Code one-three-one.

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,040
All hands on the bridge.

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,560
- What's going on?
- Yeah.

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,320
I gotta get back
to "Lord of the Rings."

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
You read?

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,960
Code one-three-one.

20
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,560
{\an5}Come on, guys,
I wrote a whole a whole memo.

21
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,920
Yeah, nobody read it.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,480
- I did.
- Thank you, Ray.

23
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,440
{\an5}- Pancakes for breakfast.
- No, 131 is not, is it?

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,920
Yeah. Does that mean no pancakes?

25
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,600
{\an5}Anyway, I wrote a song
to help us remember all the codes.

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,280
It goes like this. From the top.

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,920
<i>If the code is 1-1-1</i>

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,240
<i>Mallus escaped the time dungeon</i>

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,320
<i>If the code is 1-1-2...</i>

30
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,520
{\an5}- All right, Nate, just tell us.
- Someone stole the jumpship.

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,360
Where's Amaya?

32
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,800
According to the jumpship logs,
Zambesi, 1992.

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,600
Right before the warlords
destroyed her village.

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,960
And she dies.

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,280
The old her, that is.

36
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,960
The temporal zone
is getting real choppy.

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,720
Yeah, the timeline was crumbling
even before Amaya

38
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,880
decided to change history.

39
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,360
If that happens,
the Darhk's will be able

40
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,760
to free their demon.

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,680
{\an5}Oh, well, I'd better get back
to my movie.

42
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,600
{\an5}And we'd better stop Amaya
before she does something reckless.

43
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,440
- Gideon, plot a course for...
<i>- Pardon me, Captain Lance.</i>

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,120
<i>But we are receiving an urgent call
from Mr. Hunter.</i>

45
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,320
- You good?
- Gideon, put him on.

46
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,680
<i>The Bureau needs backup.</i>

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,840
<i>Grodd's going after Barry.</i>

48
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,880
Well, that explains
the time turbulence.

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,960
The Flash is always in trouble.
It's kind of his thing.

50
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,760
<i>Not that particular Barry.</i>

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,080
OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE 1979

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Profiles in Courage
President John F. Kennedy

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,120
<i>Barack Obama.</i>

54
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,000
<i>It will almost be
an honor to kill you.</i>

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,720
{\an5}All right, people, we're dealing
with two anachronisms now,

56
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,440
Zambesi and young Obama.

57
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,200
{\an5}Wally, Nate, I want you guys
to go talk some sense into Amaya.

58
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,160
You mean, convince her
to stand down while her village

59
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,320
and family is torn apart?

60
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,880
{\an5}What if I use my temporal simulator
to find some loophole

61
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,520
{\an5}that Amaya can use
to help save Zambesi?

62
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,560
All right, do it.

63
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,000
The rest of us, we're on Obamacare.

64
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,640
<i>You will not escape.</i>

65
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,960
<i>Grodd will complete his mission.</i>

66
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,520
<i>Time to make America Grodd again.</i>

67
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,000
Clearly, you have some grievances.

68
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,360
But perhaps we can look
for a common ground.

69
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
Or not.

70
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,640
Finally, the cage is breaking.

71
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,240
I can feel his arrival.

72
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,720
Oh, goodie.

73
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,160
<i>Yes, resist.</i>

74
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,160
<i>You will only prolong your suffering.</i>

75
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,720
Should have wasted
your hairy ass in 'Nam.

76
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,440
Run, Barry, run.

77
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,960
<i>A hairless ape who fights with fire.</i>

78
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,960
<i>How primitive.</i>

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,280
Nora. Nora, honey.

80
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,800
- You okay?
- We were so close.

81
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,480
My master was escaping his bonds.

82
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,960
{\an5}- What happened?
- Grodd's mission must have failed.

83
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Maybe that could be a good thing.

84
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
{\an5}It gives you and me time
to figure out

85
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,040
{\an5}what the big guy's arrival
really means.

86
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,440
It means the end of history.

87
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,320
A chance for us to live as gods.

88
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
As gods?

89
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,000
Man, that sounds fantastic and all.

90
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,600
{\an5}But what I just saw, it seems like
there won't be a "you" anymore.

91
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,840
It'll just be him.

92
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,200
That's what we always wanted.

93
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
Isn't it?

94
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,920
Totally. 100 percent.

95
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,800
You know, I'm just gonna check
on our grumpy gorilla

96
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,320
and see how he screwed
this thing up.

97
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
I'll see you later.

98
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,000
No, you won't.

99
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Of course.

100
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,840
{\an5}Because once I complete
Grodd's mission, you will be gone.

101
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,520
What I meant to say was...

102
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,520
I'll see Mallus later.

103
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,040
Goodbye, Nora doll.

104
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,800
<i>Grodd will destroy you. You're dead!</i>

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,320
Nice work.
Let's get him back to the ship.

106
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,680
Yeah. Come on, teeny-tiny Grodd.

107
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,200
I think we still have
some chew toys left over

108
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,320
from the saber-toothed tiger.

109
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,640
{\an5}Nice to meet you. I'm a PhD student
doing history research, Andy Watkins.

110
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,480
No one cares about the cover story.

111
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,040
{\an5}Shut up, Darren Apple bottom,
talent scout for the New York Knicks.

112
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,280
What are you doing here?

113
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,560
What are you doing here?

114
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,440
{\an5}Preventing the genocide
of my people tomorrow.

115
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,960
We know. We're here to stop you.

116
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,920
Peacefully.

117
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,880
Look, Amaya, I know you're upset
about what happened to Kuasa,

118
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,520
and all I can say is I am,
I'm truly sorry.

119
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,920
I don't blame you
for my granddaughter's death,

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Nathaniel.

121
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,120
I blame the warlords
who draw closer by the minute.

122
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,320
And I intend to stop them,
so stay out of my way.

123
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,880
I must say,
it has been such an honor, Barack.

124
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,560
- Oh, I go by Barry.
- I really like Barack.

125
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,240
Well, Barack is what it says
on my birth certificate.

126
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,840
Yeah, you might want
to hold on to that.

127
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,320
So, what's the backup plan?

128
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,200
{\an5}Well, according to Ray's song,
this is a code two-two-two.

129
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
What's that?

130
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,520
{\an5}It means we're screwed
no matter what we do.

131
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,960
All right. Crisis averted.

132
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,680
And a new one's just begun.

133
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,320
- You're not getting Obama.
- I'm not here for him.

134
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,480
I'm here for my daughter.

135
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,280
And I need your help.

136
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,360
I assure you,
this is completely unnecessary.

137
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,040
I come, as they say, in peace.

138
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,800
And I, as they say,
think you're full of crap.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,680
- I'm a changed man, Sara.
- The only change

140
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,920
I want to see you
go through is from alive to dead.

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,040
Ray, how we doing
with Constantine's spell?

142
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,440
Just need one more splash
of bat spleen.

143
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,520
Sorry, bat. And that should do it.

144
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,800
Maybe I missed an ingredient.

145
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,760
Your Ankh symbol,
it's... it's upside down.

146
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,480
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

147
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
No, it's not.

148
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,040
I knew it'd be difficult
to get you guys to trust me.

149
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,280
- Try impossible.
- Which is why I brought

150
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,920
this gesture of good faith.

151
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,240
The Water Totem.

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,480
I borrowed it from my daughter after
she ripped it from Kuasa's chest.

153
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,320
Sorry about that, by the way.

154
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,680
Do you guys mind
if I give you a hand with this?

155
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,600
You seem to be struggling a bit.

156
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,880
Yeah? Okay, great.

157
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,160
Cool.

158
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,200
Now, try to choke me.

159
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,600
- Really?
- Yeah.

160
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,600
- You... you can't.
- Satisfied?

161
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Yeah.

162
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,600
That Water Totem's
gotta be worth something.

163
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,640
With all six, you guys might actually
have a chance against Mallus.

164
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,200
You mean the same demon you've been
creating anachronisms to release?

165
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,960
That was before I realized
what our partnership would cost me.

166
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,360
- Nora...
- Dies

167
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,880
the moment the demon escapes.

168
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,440
Now, I know this might
rankle you a bit, Sara,

169
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,480
but our interests are aligned.

170
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,520
We can save Nora
and stop Mallus from being freed,

171
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
together.

172
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,080
- No.
- Excuse me?

173
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,920
Rory, kill him.

174
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,760
Wait, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait. Okay, look.

175
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,320
I... I know Damien
has done terrible things in his past

176
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,880
which cannot be forgiven,

177
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,920
but I... I know
that he loves his daughter.

178
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,560
- We can't just kill him.
- He was already dead.

179
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,600
Killing him would be repairing
an anachronism.

180
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,760
Yeah, so would incarcerating him
in the Bureau.

181
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,120
I agree with Rip.

182
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,640
We need to think through
this situation rationally.

183
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Boss?

184
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
Stand down.

185
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,040
I'm glad to see you came
to your senses.

186
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,040
Think this makes us straight,
you're wrong.

187
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,800
What are we even doing here, man?

188
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,520
We need to stop Amaya,
not party with the village.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
There she is.

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,720
Okay, great.
Well, let's get her out of here.

191
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,760
Not our Amaya.

192
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,320
That Amaya.

193
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,240
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, it just means...

194
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
My Amaya comes back to Zambesi,...

195
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,560
and we don't grow old together.

196
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
For thousands of years,

197
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,280
the Anansi Totem
has been in my family.

198
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,600
And tonight, it is my great joy...

199
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,720
to pass this totem
down to my own daughter.

200
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,960
Make way for the new protector
of Zambesi, Esi.

201
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,360
Kuasa,

202
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,120
where is Esi, child?

203
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,200
I'm sorry, Nana Baa, but...

204
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,840
mother isn't coming.

205
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,040
My daughter has chosen...

206
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,720
to reject her destiny and her duty.

207
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,120
I am sorry.

208
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,400
We have come here for nothing.

209
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,320
Amaya. What just happened?

210
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,120
My daughter rejected the totem.

211
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,920
You sound more excited
than I thought you'd be.

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,400
Esi never bonded with the totem.

213
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,640
This is why the warlords
were able to destroy my village.

214
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,560
You think you can convince Esi
to be a totem bearer.

215
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,200
She'll protect the village tomorrow.

216
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,280
She'll protect Kuasa.

217
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,880
Everything will change.

218
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,080
That's the problem.

219
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,280
I saw what happened
with Barry Allen when he went back

220
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,240
and stopped his mother's murder,
a little thing called Flashpoint.

221
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,880
We can't change history. I'm sorry.

222
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Tell her, Nate.

223
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
Nate?

224
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,960
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but screw history for once.

225
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,040
Okay, so you go talk
to your daughter,

226
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,920
and I go talk to you, the older you.

227
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,200
You always had a way with her.

228
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,880
- Come on.
- Wait, we doing what?

229
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
So, listen...

230
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
Are you okay?

231
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,600
The hardest thing
I ever had to do in my life

232
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,880
was let Darhk live.

233
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,120
And now he's back,

234
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,960
and it is taking every ounce
of self-control not to kill him.

235
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,440
And I keep asking myself, "Why?"

236
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,760
For the good of the mission.

237
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,920
"For the good of the mission."

238
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
Listen to yourself.

239
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,640
- You sound like some government...
- Clone?

240
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,920
I was gonna say "stiff."

241
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,520
You know, Rip thought
I could talk some sense into you,

242
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,680
- but maybe...
- Wait.

243
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,520
You're here because of Rip?

244
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,960
Why would you do
anything for that man?

245
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,520
Ava, he lied to you.

246
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,440
He implanted false memories
into your head.

247
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,840
He hired actors to pretend
to be your parents.

248
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,600
I mean, what more is it gonna take
to get you to confront him?

249
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,440
I am prioritizing the mission
over my own personal baggage.

250
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,280
You and your team
should try it sometime.

251
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,400
No, that's not what you're doing.

252
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,920
You're covering,

253
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,480
because you're afraid
of what you might find out.

254
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,120
What else is there to find out, Sara?

255
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,680
I'm one of thousands.
I was grown in a lab.

256
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,520
There has to be more
to the story, Ava,

257
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,200
and you deserve to know.

258
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
Look, you need...

259
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,560
You need to talk to Rip now.

260
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,760
Could do with a wee nip myself.

261
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,560
Everything good, Director Sharpe?

262
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,040
- Peachy.
- Are we good to

263
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,600
transport Mr. Darhk back
to the Bureau?

264
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,560
No, Rip, we're not.

265
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,120
- Where are you going?
- To go talk to someone

266
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,160
who can think straight
when the whole world has gone crazy.

267
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,760
So, what you're saying is...

268
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,160
you won't aid the man
that killed your sister,

269
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,640
even if it will prevent
Mollusk from escaping...

270
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
"Mallus."

271
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,960
From escaping his
interdimensional prison...

272
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,360
and wreaking havoc across time?

273
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,760
Yeah, when you put it that way,
it does sound kind of petty.

274
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,520
Not at all. It sounds...

275
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,520
- It sounds human.
- Okay.

276
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,320
But then what? I'm just supposed
to hand Darhk over to Ava

277
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,200
and let the Time Bureau deal
with him?

278
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,360
Oh. Your ex is clinging to rules
and regulations in the face

279
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,520
of the startling revelation
that she is...

280
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,800
- I'm sorry, a clone, was it?
- Yeah.

281
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,920
But here's the thing.

282
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,240
I'm not convinced
the Bureau is best equipped

283
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,440
to stop a demon.

284
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,200
No, it sounds like
that calls for a much more

285
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,160
unorthodox approach.

286
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,120
I really miss you.

287
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
Oh, hi guys.

288
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,640
I do hope you're not feeling
all killy-killy, stabby-stabby.

289
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,000
I want you to listen to me carefully.

290
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,680
I don't believe for a second
that you've changed.

291
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,520
You're still the same
cowardly son of a bitch.

292
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,200
that put an arrow in my sister.

293
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,440
But I will work with you
to defeat Mallus under one condition.

294
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,160
After this is over,

295
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,760
I'm putting you back in the ground
where you belong.

296
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
Deal.

297
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,040
Is so, do any of these
flashing screens actually

298
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,920
- do anything?
- Focus, Damien.

299
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,040
How do we capture
your demon daughter?

300
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,400
Well, if we coordinate a strike
between the Legends

301
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,480
and the Time Bureau,
we might be able to take her down.

302
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,680
How did that work for you
in Victorian London?

303
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,360
Besides, my little angel's
only gotten more powerful since.

304
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,960
What if we just ask Nora nicely?

305
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,000
I did have a bit of a connection
with her in Berlin.

306
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,240
- Not that kind.
- All right,

307
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,640
maybe she'll listen
to her dear old dad.

308
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,000
Not anymore.
Nora only listens to Mallus now.

309
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,320
He's always in her ear.

310
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,360
That's it. What if I got inside Nora?

311
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,680
Not like that.

312
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,800
What if I shrunk down,

313
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,240
flew into her ear
and pretended to be Mallus?

314
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,960
Okay, new guy on the team here.
Is that a joke plan or a real plan?

315
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,240
- We are so screwed.
- No, this could work.

316
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,920
We just have to convince her
that it's actually him.

317
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,240
<i>This is how you would
serve your city.</i>

318
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,160
<i>- You would risk its utter ruin.</i>
- That's it.

319
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,480
<i>I did what I judged to be right.</i>

320
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,280
<i>What you judged to be right?</i>

321
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,720
<i>You sent the Ring of Power
into Mordor,</i>

322
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,040
<i>in the hands of a witless halfling.</i>

323
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,120
The vocal similarity
to Mallus is uncanny.

324
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,680
- Quiet.
<i>- It should have been brought back</i>

325
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,800
- Gideon? Who is that actor?
<i>- to the Citadel to be kept safe.</i>

326
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,920
And how can we get him
without dealing with his agent?

327
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,560
{\an5}- Red leather, yellow leather.
- Yeah?

328
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,840
{\an5}- Mister, mister Noble?
- What?

329
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,720
We have some, last-minute rewrites.

330
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,120
<i>No, worries. We'll fix them in post.</i>

331
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,840
Tell Peter Jackson no more chickens?

332
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,400
I ate four this morning?

333
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,920
- So, what's up, mate?
- Yeah, so. Rewrites, from Peter.

334
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,080
And he'd like me to,
run lines with you.

335
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
You're kidding.

336
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,720
Okay.

337
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Let's see.

338
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,280
"Nora, you must heed my command."

339
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,440
That's good. That's good.

340
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,960
- Who's Nora?
- Nora.

341
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,440
Nora, she's a new character that,

342
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,200
well they wanted to beef up
the female presence in the film.

343
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,440
You can't do that, mate.

344
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,760
It's Tolkien, "Lord of the Rings."

345
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,120
I know but it's a studio note.

346
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,520
Oh, studio note.
Very good note, yeah, all right.

347
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,040
- Yeah, from the top?
- Yeah, right.

348
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,560
"Nora, you must heed my command."

349
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
"What is it, Master?"

350
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,640
"Go to the Waverider, Nora."

351
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,600
"I... I cannot go to the Waverider."

352
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,800
"The totems are ripe
for the picking."

353
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,880
This is crap, isn't it?

354
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,960
Well, I mean, who wrote this?

355
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,480
- I mean, somebody...
- Don't, don't worry about it.

356
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
- Took a lot of time
- Don't worry about it.

357
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,520
"The totems are ripe for the picking.

358
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,560
- Your father will lead you to them."
- "My father?"

359
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Esi.

360
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,040
Who are you?

361
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,400
I am a distant cousin.

362
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,480
I came for the ceremony.

363
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,160
Sorry to disappoint you.

364
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,360
I love it here.

365
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,520
When I was a child, I'd come here
and lose myself in the stars,

366
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,960
think about where my life would lead.

367
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,040
For as long as I can remember,

368
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,360
the Anansi Totem has been my destiny.

369
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,600
But now, I'm not sure I want it.

370
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,760
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

371
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,720
My mother is the great Amaya Jiwe.

372
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,440
She's protected our village
her entire life.

373
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,840
She never doubted, never wavered.

374
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,120
That's not true.

375
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,960
Every totem bearer
starts their journey with doubt.

376
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,160
Even your mother.

377
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,640
I will never live up to her legacy.

378
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,520
You have her strength
and the strength of all others

379
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,800
who've come before her.

380
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,480
But there is danger coming,

381
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,320
and your people need you
to stand up for them.

382
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,080
All right,
you fathwoom into Amaya's hut,

383
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,800
grab the totem,
and we'll give it to her daughter.

384
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,600
Nate, I... I now that you have
some space from her,

385
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,480
I need you to come to your senses.

386
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,240
Amaya can't see this,
she's too close.

387
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,120
But she's going
to cause more harm than good

388
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,240
if this releases Mallus.

389
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,880
- We don't know that.
- We do. You do.

390
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,880
I can't not help her, Wally.

391
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,000
I love you, man, but I will stop you
if you take this too far.

392
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,840
Like stealing candy
from a very old baby.

393
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,160
Oh, Amaya, wait. It's me.

394
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,280
You know, I didn't think
this would do it for me,

395
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
- but it actually kind of does.
- Who are you?

396
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,840
- It's me, Nate.
- Who?

397
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Nate. I know it's been a while,

398
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,720
but we used
to travel through time together.

399
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,720
You know, do other things...

400
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,800
- If this is some kind of a joke...
- It's not a joke.

401
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,520
I have pictures of us on my phone.

402
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,080
This is me.

403
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Of course.

404
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,520
- You really don't remember, do you?
- How is this possible?

405
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,480
We were part of a beaching team that
traveled through time together.

406
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:08,320
- I mean, the 1942 you.
- Why are you here, time traveler?

407
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,840
To keep my promise to you,

408
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,120
by making sure your daughter Esi
gets the Spirit Totem tonight.

409
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,520
She didn't even show up
to her own ceremony.

410
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,880
Her head is always somewhere else.

411
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,560
She doesn't know what she wants.

412
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,520
Yeah, you had a hard time

413
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,680
figuring that out too
when you were her age.

414
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,200
But, look, if Esi believed
you were truly in her corner,

415
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,000
she wouldn't doubt herself.

416
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,400
She would accept the totem
and be unstoppable,

417
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
just like you.

418
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,640
Hey, there, Nora doll.

419
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,440
Why am I still here?

420
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,640
Why is the Master still in prison?
You failed me.

421
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,640
I know, it's terrible.
The Legends captured Grodd,

422
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,360
and this whole Obama thing
is just not working,

423
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,480
so perhaps Mallus can advise us
as to what to do next.

424
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,080
Mallus only speaks when he desires.

425
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,280
- I can't just "summon" him.
- Well, maybe we'll just...

426
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,640
wait here until he gets the itch.

427
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,320
<i>Nora. You must heed my command.</i>

428
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,240
It's him. He's speaking to me.
Very loudly.

429
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,440
Really? Mallus is speaking to you?

430
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,280
I need to concentrate.

431
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,880
<i>Go to the Waverider, Nora.</i>

432
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,400
The Waverider, why?

433
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,960
<i>The totems are ripe for the picking.</i>

434
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,440
<i>Your father will lead you to them.</i>

435
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,320
- My father?
- What... Mallus has plans for me?

436
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,560
- I... I wonder what those are.
- The... the... the Legends' ship.

437
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,440
The Master wants you
to take me there.

438
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,200
Oh, I would in a heartbeat,

439
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,160
but we are hopelessly
outnumbered, honey.

440
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
There's just no way...

441
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,880
<i>- He must take you there now, Nora.</i>
- Just do it.

442
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,120
God, do it. Don't be a fool.

443
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,960
No, problemo. Let's go.

444
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,880
Those totems should
be around here somewhere.

445
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
You.

446
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,200
What is this?

447
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,400
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
but it's for your own good.

448
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
No.

449
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,520
No!

450
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,920
I get it.

451
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,280
You think that I failed you

452
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,720
because I joined with the Legends
and trapped you here.

453
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
Well, you're right.

454
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,520
I did fail you. But that's not how.

455
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,440
I was a terrible father.

456
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,720
I was obsessed with world domination.

457
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,400
Because of that...

458
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,040
I died,
leaving you all alone as a child,

459
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,720
trapped with my name
and my foolish dreams.

460
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,040
Oh, I turned you into a demon
long before Mallus did.

461
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,000
It's why I'm begging you,

462
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,680
do not let him take you away from me.

463
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,640
Your daughter is long gone.

464
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,040
No!

465
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,440
I know you can hear me. Fight him.

466
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,320
Oh, there was no fight.

467
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,040
Her soul...

468
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,520
her flesh...

469
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,680
were freely given.

470
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,160
You sick son of a bitch.

471
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,320
One more alteration
to the timeline

472
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,520
and my cage crumbles.

473
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,200
- Can't believe that worked.
- I can.

474
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,960
Sara knows what she's doing.

475
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,480
I may have my flaws, but I do know

476
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,600
how to pick the best people
for the job.

477
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,440
- So, why did you pick me?
- What? Come on.

478
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,240
Brilliant mind, calm demeanor,
incredible strength.

479
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,480
And unlike the Legends,
you actually follow rules.

480
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,440
It almost sounds like
I was made for the job.

481
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,480
What are you getting at?

482
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,480
I know I'm a clone, Rip.

483
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,000
- I see.
- So, why me?

484
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,960
Of all the clones in 2213,
why did you pick me?

485
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
You're special.

486
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,800
So, why'd you erase my memory?

487
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,280
- I thought it would be easier.
- Easier?

488
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,120
Easier for you or easier for me?

489
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,760
Don't lose focus, Ava.
You are too critical to this mission.

490
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,960
Well, the good news is if I die,

491
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,880
you can just skip off to 2213,
and get yourself another clone.

492
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,240
Oh, my God.

493
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,360
I wasn't even the first one, was I?

494
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,560
We both know how hard it is
to find agents as talented as you.

495
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,640
And to find one
who is also replaceable is

496
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,760
- invaluable...
- How many?

497
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,360
How many?

498
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,840
You're the 12th.

499
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
The 12th?

500
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,040
So, I wasn't even
your first choice?

501
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,640
- Or your second or...
- You don't understand.

502
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,640
- You are exceptional.
- Don't, Rip.

503
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
Just don't.

504
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,600
Nora's gone.

505
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,600
It's just Mallus now.

506
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,880
You must be enjoying this,

507
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,080
seeing your nemesis
with a broken heart.

508
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,240
I didn't know you
had a heart to break.

509
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,000
Where was it the night
you murdered my sister?

510
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,760
Look, what I did was unforgivable.

511
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,760
But back then,
I hadn't loved anyone enough

512
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,800
to understand the pain that I caused.

513
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,440
Not that it's any comfort,
but if I could take it all back,

514
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,440
I would.

515
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,160
We all have regrets.

516
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,440
But we can't undo
the things that we've done.

517
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
True.

518
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,920
But even the worst of us
can be made whole again.

519
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,040
You, for example.

520
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,480
League to Legend
to killer to captain.

521
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,120
That's not a bad makeover, is it?

522
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
- It's not good enough.
- Why?

523
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,120
Because you put on the Death Totem
and almost killed your entire team?

524
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,480
- Yes.
- But you didn't, did you?

525
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
And you know why?

526
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,400
The same reason I'm spilling my guts

527
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,200
to a woman who's imagined
my death a thousand times over.

528
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,680
- More like 10,000.
- Love.

529
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
Sara.

530
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,280
Because without it, people like us,
we're left alone with the darkness.

531
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,280
That's not good for anyone, is it?

532
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,760
I'm so proud of you, my child.

533
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,120
Esi's embraced her destiny.

534
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,720
Tomorrow when the marauders come,
she'll be ready.

535
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,040
And if she's not,
we'll be right there

536
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,320
to fight alongside her.

537
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,160
You don't have to stay, Nathaniel.

538
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,280
I know that what I did was selfish.

539
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,160
You couldn't be selfish if you tried.

540
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,200
Now, you see that booming granny
over there?

541
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,320
She doesn't remember me,

542
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,040
or the Legends.

543
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,880
You know, why that is?

544
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,840
I must have erased my memory.

545
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,160
And why would you do that?

546
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,040
Because if I chose to come back here,

547
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,560
after everything
we've been through, then

548
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,120
erasing you would be the only way

549
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,480
that I could be the protector
my people deserve.

550
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,760
Otherwise,
I'd always be split in two.

551
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,760
And part of me would be
in love with you.

552
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,920
I tried to reason with them,
but they won't listen.

553
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,680
Amaya is dead set
on saving her village.

554
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,760
And Nate? He's just...

555
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,200
- Whipped.
- I was gonna say "in love."

556
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,280
- But, yeah, same thing.
- Zari, please tell me that

557
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,840
you found a loophole that allows
Amaya to save her village.

558
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,200
There is no loophole.
I've tried billions of variations,

559
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,280
but this event has too
many ripple effects.

560
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,880
<i>The village has to be destroyed.</i>

561
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,480
- Or Mallus is freed.
- And we're all doomed.

562
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,880
What if we're not?

563
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,800
We have the six totems,

564
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,800
the only thing
that Mallus is afraid of.

565
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,280
But you can't fight
what you can't see.

566
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,400
What if the only way
to kill Mallus is to let him out?

567
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,360
Are you really suggesting
that we allow Mallus to escape

568
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,760
because you have
a collection of magical stones?

569
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,840
Look, we have two choices,
we fight Amaya or we fight Mallus.

570
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,160
And I know it sounds crazy
to let a time demon out,

571
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,160
but it's a hell of a lot easier
to stomach

572
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,480
than turning on a friend.

573
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,800
Okay, yes,
but didn't the original totem bearers

574
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,560
try and face Mallus
and... and blow it?

575
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,840
Constantine said the only reason
they couldn't kill Mallus

576
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,960
was because the Death Totem
betrayed them.

577
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,280
And that's not
gonna happen this time.

578
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,760
How can you be so sure?

579
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,280
I needn't remind you what happened
the last time you tried to wield it.

580
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,480
She won't have to wield it.

581
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,640
I will.

582
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,920
The Death Totem
was attracted to Captain Lance

583
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,080
because of a unique quality
we both share.

584
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,240
We were both brought back
from the dead.

585
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,240
Plus, I have a personal stake

586
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,280
in wanting to send Mallus
straight to Hell.

587
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,400
He took my little girl.

588
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,000
True as that may be,
there is no chance that Captain Lance

589
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,200
would trust you
with such a dangerous weapon.

590
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,600
Death Totem's all yours.

591
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,520
- Sara, you can't be serious.
- Ava, we don't have a choice.

592
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,480
Our only choice is to stop Amaya
and stop the anachronisms.

593
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,720
- This is insanity.
- Insane is what we do best, Ava.

594
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,920
I will not condone this behavior,

595
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,160
and the Bureau certainly
does not stand behind you.

596
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,040
Rip, let's go.
We have work to do.

597
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,840
Remember when I told you
that we would need the Legends

598
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,920
before this was through?

599
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,720
Perhaps it is time
that we set aside the scalpel

600
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,760
and let them be the chainsaw.

601
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,080
I will consider
that your resignation.

602
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Ava.

603
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,880
Ava, wait.

604
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,320
This plan can work and you know it.
You just need to trust your gut.

605
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
My gut?

606
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,240
You mean the one that was
manufactured to factory settings?

607
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,040
That's the same gut that 11 other
Ava's used and got killed?

608
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,960
- Ava, please. Just trust me.
- You don't understand.

609
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,960
This plan breaks
every rule in every book,

610
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,520
and all I have right now
are the rules, okay?

611
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
You have me.

612
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,360
What're you doing?

613
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,120
I'm admitting something
that could save us both.

614
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
I love you.

615
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,440
There is no "me" to love.

616
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,320
She looks good out there, ready.

617
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,000
Like mother, like daughter.

618
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,640
The warlords are early.

619
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,960
Hey. Oh, no.

620
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,880
- Don't puma-pounce us.
- Really, Wally?

621
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,680
- You're gonna do this?
- It's not like that, Nate.

622
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,200
- I know why you're here.
- No, no, you really don't.

623
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,000
Short version, Nora's on the ship,
tripping on Mallus juice.

624
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,600
Damien Darhk gave us the Water Totem
after they saved Barack Obama.

625
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,040
And we are here to help you
create the anachronisms

626
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,280
so we can release Mallus,
and then we can kill him.

627
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,440
Oh, and I met John Noble.

628
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,160
So, you're working with Damien Darhk?

629
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,560
Please, don't rub it in.

630
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,120
And you're letting him wield
the Death Totem.

631
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,240
In order to do justice
for someone I love.

632
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,520
Sure you can understand that.

633
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,640
Thankfully,
that is our only similarity.

634
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,560
So. Who gets Earth? Who gets Water?

635
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,720
Well, as a man of steel,
which is an element,

636
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,560
I always felt a strong connection
to the earth.

637
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,160
Actually, steel is an alloy
of iron and carbon.

638
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,880
Also, I've watched
every single episode

639
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,160
of "Planet Earth" on Blu-ray,

640
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,880
and I was only stoned
all of the time.

641
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,560
Can I just please
have the damn totem?

642
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,120
- Thank you.
- All yours.

643
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,720
And Water? Anyone?

644
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,080
Actually, water is really powerful.

645
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,040
It... it's crucial to life on Earth.

646
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,960
And did you know that
we are made up of 60 percent water?

647
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,080
- If...
- All right, I think we get it.

648
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,000
- Take a totem.
- Oh, I... I wasn't making a pitch

649
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,240
- for one.
- Just take the totem.

650
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Okay, cool.

651
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,800
All right, so is there, like,
an instruction manual?

652
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,200
- A YouTube video?
- You better figure it out.

653
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,560
Warlords are coming, and that means
Mallus is about to make his debut.

654
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,600
<i>Dad?</i>

655
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,880
Nora.

656
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,120
You're here but...

657
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,360
How? The totem means you're dead.

658
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,640
No, not yet.

659
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,400
Mallus is trying to take me,
but I'm still fighting him.

660
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,040
For now. But Dad?

661
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,440
I made a mistake.

662
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,840
I'm sorry.

663
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,920
I don't want him to take me.

664
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,080
Please don't let him take me.
I'm scared.

665
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,360
You ready?

666
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,120
Yeah, let's do this
before it's too late.

667
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,720
This place has been sacred
to my people

668
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,000
since the dawn of time.

669
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,520
The totems will be strongest here.

670
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,200
Well, they'd better be,
because mine's not turning on.

671
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,880
It's time.

672
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,400
As soon as Esi defeats the warlords,
our fight against Mallus begins.

673
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,680
Should we help your daughter?

674
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,840
Esi's got this.

675
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,040
<i>- No, no, no.</i>
- Looks like it's time

676
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,240
to meet our monster.

677
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,440
Or our maker.

678
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,960
I'm not dying today.

679
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,920
Here's Mallus.

680
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,640
Why isn't she transforming?

681
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,480
- Rip, what gives?
- The historical record is

682
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,320
showing that Zambesi's
still destroyed.

683
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,080
That doesn't make any sense.
The battle's over. The good guys won.

684
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,600
- Rip, what's going on?
- Oh, my God.

685
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,400
The warlords
don't destroy the village.

686
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,400
The village was destroyed by
an angry gorilla.

687
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,160
- I had to. She's my daughter.
- You released Grodd.

688
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,960
I need history to run its course.

689
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,200
<i>Your time must end.</i>

690
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,640
This way. Quick.

691
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,360
You should go too, Maame.
I can handle this beast.

692
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,480
I believe in you, Obabaa.

693
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,560
Esi. No.

694
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,840
Amaya.

695
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
Amaya.

696
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,800
Hey, hey, are you okay?

697
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
I'm okay.

698
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,720
Nate, my family...

699
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,040
I won't let them die. I promise.

700
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,320
Damien, Mallus is coming.
This won't save Nora.

701
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,240
If there's a chance in hell,
I'm gonna take it.

702
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,440
I'll handle this.

703
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,040
"Always incapacitate
your speedster first."

704
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,520
That's day one stuff.

705
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,400
Let him go.

706
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,840
I'm warning you,
don't stand in my way.

707
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,800
I was powerful
before I had this trinket,

708
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,600
but now I'm unstoppable.

709
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,400
Yeah, we've heard that one before.

710
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,920
I don't want to kill you.

711
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,760
I want to kill them
to save my daughter.

712
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,560
Why can't you understand that?

713
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,960
Can't move.

714
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,520
- What is happening?
<i>- Foolish human.</i>

715
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,720
<i>You are now mine to control.</i>

716
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,440
You will not harm my village.

717
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,080
Maame. Get away from him.

718
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,440
It worked.

719
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
Amaya.

720
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,440
Nathaniel.

721
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,560
I... I didn't take you
for a totem bearer.

722
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,600
That makes two of us.

723
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
Nora.

724
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,280
I'll find you. I promise.

725
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,240
Go.

726
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,160
Go.

727
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,720
Hey.

728
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,320
Performance anxiety, Raymond?

729
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,040
You're only proving my point
that this plan was never gonna work.

730
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,880
Oh, come on. Don't make me do this.

731
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,360
It's too bad, really.

732
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,880
I was just beginning
to like you after Berlin.

733
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,840
You literally stabbed me in the back.

734
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,560
It only seemed fitting.

735
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,640
You're lucky I wasn't aiming
for your heart.

736
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,840
I am not gonna let Nora
be taken by him.

737
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,480
Nora's gone, Damien.

738
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,720
Finally, I am free.

739
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,040
No.

740
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,720
- Nora.
- You can't help her, Ray.

741
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,400
Oh, my God.

742
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,800
I am so much more than a God.
