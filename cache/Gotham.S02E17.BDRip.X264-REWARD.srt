1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,546
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,713 --> 00:00:06,758
But you are my only
true blood relative, Oswald.

3
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:08,968
That vermin has to go.

4
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:11,388
But, how can we persuade him to go?

5
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,473
How do you get rid of rats?

6
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:17,936
- Did he, did he drink that?
- Yes.

7
00:00:18,103 --> 00:00:20,188
Why? Why? He's not supposed to.

8
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:22,607
No!

9
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:25,735
Awake at last.

10
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:29,114
Well, hello, dear.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,241
Someone call Professor Strange!

12
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:33,743
<i>We'll see about your
clever little plan, Jim Gordon.</i>

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,954
<i>I can make plans of my own.</i>

14
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:38,498
- Hello, Officer Pinkney. Can I come in?
- Sure.

15
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,794
Murder weapon was a crowbar.
Your fingerprints were on it.

16
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:44,170
I was set up!

17
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:47,006
<i>Being convicted for murder
has its downsides.</i>

18
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:48,258
It was good to see you, Harv.

19
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:49,634
Don't give up hope.

20
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:50,802
What the hell are you doing here?

21
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,096
What's it look like?
We're getting you out of here.

22
00:00:53,263 --> 00:00:54,305
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

23
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:55,515
I have to clear my name.

24
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:57,559
<i>And to do that
I have to go to back to Gotham.</i>

25
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:02,397
You little thugs!

26
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,817
Don't you take that bag!

27
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:08,570
Do you have any idea
who you're stealing from?

28
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:12,824
Leave it!

29
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:29,007
That's my money!

30
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,052
Boo-hoo! You stole it.
Now you got stole, chump.

31
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:35,472
I catch you, you're dead! Both of you!

32
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:38,308
By the way, you're a terrible crook,
letting two kids rob you.

33
00:01:38,475 --> 00:01:40,477
You really don't deserve this money.

34
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:43,354
What the hell are you doing,
you little freak?

35
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:44,939
What the hell are you doing?

36
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:49,861
You're both dead!
Nobody's ever gonna touch my money!

37
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:53,364
I'm not a thief.
I don't steal for the money.

38
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:54,991
This is research.
I can't understand Gotham,

39
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:56,326
- until I understand its criminals.
- Okay.

40
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:59,913
This whole "understanding criminals" thing
is getting on my nerves.

41
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,748
That was your half you threw out.

42
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:07,796
I saved enough for burgers.

43
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:09,589
<i>Gotham is on high alert today</i>

44
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:14,302
<i>after former GCPD detective
and convicted murderer, James Gordon,</i>

45
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,930
<i>escaped from Blackgate Prison last night.</i>

46
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:18,640
Detective Bullock,
have you heard the news?

47
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,974
Yeah, Ed, I heard.

48
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,309
So what do you think he'll do?

49
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:23,686
Knowing Jim Gordon,
I'd say he's not gonna rest

50
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:26,856
until he finds the son-of-a-bitch
who framed him for murder.

51
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:31,778
Good luck with that.

52
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:36,783
Bullock. This is your one and
only chance to tell me where he is.

53
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:39,035
Hand to God, Cap, I have no idea.

54
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:41,788
Oh, stop it. You're not smart enough
to play dumb.

55
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:44,582
We both know Jim did not kill Pinkney.

56
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,918
I know that the court found him guilty.

57
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,255
He wants to prove his own innocence,
great, I hope he does.

58
00:02:50,463 --> 00:02:53,550
The public, the people of Gotham,
the ones you and I serve...

59
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:57,303
They have to know. They have to see
that we're impartial, you understand?

60
00:02:57,512 --> 00:03:00,306
The people of Gotham can eat my socks.

61
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:05,520
Hey! Hey! Nice try.

62
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:09,440
Walk away in a huff.
Now I know you know something.

63
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:12,318
If you're providing aid and shelter
to Jim Gordon,

64
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:14,612
anything, a glass of water,

65
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,448
I will bust you like a bum I never met.

66
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:21,286
Cap, I wish I knew where he was,
but I don't.

67
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:25,665
Go.

68
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:37,468
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Let's get to work.

69
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,859
I've been going over and over this
a thousand times in my mind.

70
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:54,611
It all has to be connected.

71
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,947
The theft at the art museum,
the bombing at the train station,

72
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:00,491
the IA tipoff, Pinkney's murder...

73
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,370
It's all a part of an elaborate frame.

74
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:09,542
So, he's smart, meticulous,
got technical skill, and access.

75
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:13,421
- An active cop?
- Has to be.

76
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:17,508
Only way that he could have access to
a crowbar after it was put into evidence.

77
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,929
That doesn't really narrow
the suspect list too much.

78
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,014
I mean, come on, Jim, be honest,

79
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:26,684
you probably got 500 cops
who have beef with you.

80
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:30,396
- Yeah, but enough to frame me for murder?
- Maybe 10.

81
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:32,607
You got to admit,

82
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:36,861
you do have a little bit of a knack
for, uh, making enemies.

83
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,489
My number was 12.

84
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:41,532
- Hmm.
- Mainly Loeb loyalists.

85
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,868
Who knows?
Maybe Loeb himself is behind this.

86
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:46,037
Before you go down that rabbit hole,

87
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:48,831
I've gotta say something
to you as a friend.

88
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,751
You can still run.

89
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:56,381
<i>Go to an island. Buy a banana boat.
Grow a beard. Find Lee. Have a life.</i>

90
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,758
Look, I've been working this thing
since you went away,

91
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:00,718
and I'm not saying it's hopeless,

92
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,887
but Barnes is on the hunt.

93
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,932
- You don't have much time.
- Did he threaten you?

94
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:08,434
Hey, I'm the one who busted you
out of jail, remember?

95
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:10,103
I made my choice.

96
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:11,938
All right, let's say, I run.

97
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,233
I find Lee. I somehow convince her
to take me back. What then?

98
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:17,610
I get her to live as a fugitive?

99
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:23,074
I have to clear my name.
Otherwise, I might as well be in jail.

100
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:26,411
But how? Starting where?

101
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:30,373
Dent once told me IA
secretly records and archives

102
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,834
all their incoming calls on tape.

103
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:37,630
Which means, the eyewitness,
who called into IA,

104
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,799
the one they assumed was Pinkney?

105
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:42,593
There could be a tape
with his voice on it.

106
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,596
It's a hell of a long shot, brother.

107
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,185
And if... Okay.
Just saying <i>if</i> a tape like that exists,

108
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:55,398
it's gonna be locked up tighter
than a duck's ass in IA evidence.

109
00:05:56,858 --> 00:06:00,653
That's why it's lucky for you,
Uncle Harvey has connections.

110
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:04,782
Hey, Ginny.

111
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:09,704
How's my favorite IA sugar plum, huh?

112
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:13,166
Well, why do you think I'm calling, baby?

113
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,503
- Heard you're getting married?
- No, she changed her mind.

114
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,131
Smart girl. Oh.

115
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,469
You're an animal, Bullock.
You know that?

116
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,095
Oh, yes, ma'am, I do, I do.

117
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:27,638
Oh!

118
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:31,559
- Come on, Bullock.
- Yeah, baby! I'll be right there.

119
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:33,811
Just hold on for me for a second.

120
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:40,234
Hey, an hour. Slip 'em under the door.

121
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,987
<i>- Come on, Bullock, I ain't got all night!</i>
- Don't say a word.

122
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:44,530
Mmm?

123
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:47,950
<i>Daddy's coming!</i>

124
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,144
<i>- Is that what he said?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

125
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,981
Julian had his arm all twisted up.

126
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,045
<i>Give me that!</i>

127
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:42,713
Oh, what's up, sweetheart,
what are you doing, huh?

128
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,299
- Where are you going? Give me your purse.
- What, no, no!

129
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:48,136
- Come on, do it! Just, come on, do it.
- Somebody help!

130
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:49,512
- Just do it.
- Hey!

131
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,013
No!

132
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:02,024
Get out of here. Go!

133
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,404
Ma'am, are you okay?

134
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:12,034
- You're welcome.
<i>- Hands up! Or I'll blow your head off.</i>

135
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,747
GCPD. You're under--

136
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,292
You're Jim Gordon.

137
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,918
Listen to me.

138
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:24,088
This is Barkley over on Fifth and Spring.
I got Jim--

139
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,384
- Don't kill me!
- I'm innocent, you hear me?

140
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,849
All units, it's Jim freaking Gordon!
I need backup now!

141
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,327
Father, I only knew you a short time.

142
00:08:56,871 --> 00:09:01,083
But you came to me
when I was alone in this cold, dark world.

143
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:05,796
You gave me a family.

144
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:13,930
I will never forget you as long as I live.

145
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,185
<i>Oh, Father.</i>

146
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:30,071
What a bore that was.

147
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:32,281
Yeah, but the house is ours now,
and we're rich.

148
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:33,616
Quiet.

149
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:35,660
Oh.

150
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:40,498
- He loved us all so much.
- Indeed.

151
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:42,625
But, Oswald, Oswald...

152
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:46,212
As painful as this is,
we need to talk practicalities. Um...

153
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,340
Can I call you a cab,
or will you take the bus?

154
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,467
I don't understand.

155
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:53,761
Well, you're not returning
to the house with us.

156
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:57,932
- But where shall I go?
- Anywhere, but there.

157
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,393
Oswald, I'm so happy that you
and your father reconnected,

158
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,188
but he left the house
and the estate to me, and I'm...

159
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:06,565
Well, I'm simply not comfortable sleeping
under the same roof

160
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,234
as a notorious murderer.

161
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:10,361
But I'm not like that anymore.

162
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,739
I couldn't hurt a fly,
even if I wanted to.

163
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,867
Please, my father was all that I had.

164
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,703
We shared the same blood, and--

165
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:21,706
And he wanted us to be together.
He told me.

166
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:24,709
Let me stay. I'll do anything.

167
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:34,176
You are his blood.
We do need help around the house.

168
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:35,386
- Mother.
- Mother.

169
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,597
Why waste good money on servants
when we have Oswald?

170
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,349
I'll do anything.

171
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:42,893
Well, you can start by getting rid
of those disgusting flowers.

172
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,981
- I've always detested lilies.
- Yes, of course.

173
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:51,360
You're not really letting him stay?

174
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:53,779
He's Elijah's only natural son.

175
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,824
If he found the right lawyer,
he could make things difficult.

176
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,993
Especially if people look into
how his father died.

177
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,703
So, we just live with him, then?

178
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:04,206
Yeah, we keep him close and
after a suitable amount of time goes by,

179
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:07,835
poor Oswald, overcome with grief,
will take his own life.

180
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:12,214
Till then, we have a free servant.
I can fire the maid.

181
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:22,224
I murdered my parents.

182
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,061
I cut their throats.

183
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,104
Um...

184
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:30,232
<i>I joined a gang of psychopathic killers.</i>

185
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:36,822
I tried to kill Jim Gordon
and Lee Thompkins.

186
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:41,577
I was a puppet
of these demons in my head

187
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:45,206
and, uh, they were forcing me
to do these terrible things.

188
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,628
<i>I wish I could go back
and undo what I've done.</i>

189
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:52,963
<i>Only I can't.</i>

190
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:59,804
I don't feel insane, now.

191
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:03,808
I just...

192
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:07,186
I feel sad.

193
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,273
Thank you, Barbara.

194
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,818
That was very brave.

195
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:19,698
What do you suppose
made this healthful change in you?

196
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:26,205
Maybe I just really needed some sleep.

197
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,341
It's a good act.

198
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,511
<i>You're so sure it's an act, are you?</i>

199
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,931
- Aren't you?
- I have no idea.

200
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:48,227
One way or the other, she intrigues me.

201
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:51,272
Well, if you would allow us to apply
rigorous dream therapy,

202
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,773
we would know for sure.

203
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,191
No, no, no.

204
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:59,029
<i>We do have a very useful hammer,
Ms. Peabody,</i>

205
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:03,242
but not all of our patients are nails.

206
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:22,761
Thank you.

207
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:24,972
- What the hell happened last night?
- Ah...

208
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,766
Stumbled on to a mugging.

209
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:31,228
And Jim Gordon couldn't just walk by.

210
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,355
<i>Where'd you sleep?</i>

211
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,817
I didn't. I just walked around.
How's Barnes?

212
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,652
He's on the warpath.

213
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:43,032
Governor announced a $10,000 reward
for anyone who helps catch you.

214
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,326
$10,000. You should turn me in.

215
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:48,579
If he doubled it to 20,
I'd give it some thought.

216
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,080
Okay, here.

217
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,290
<i>Internal Affairs.</i>

218
00:13:51,457 --> 00:13:54,960
<i>I--</i>
<i>I want to report a crime.</i>

219
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,881
- You recognize that voice?
- Sounds like it's been disguised.

220
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:04,428
<i>I saw Detective James Gordon
shooting Mayor Theo Galavan</i>

221
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:05,930
<i>on the Southside Docks.</i>

222
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:10,476
<i>The Penguin was beating him with a bat,
but it was Gordon that pulled the trigger.</i>

223
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:14,438
Is that a bird?

224
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:16,857
Run it back.

225
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,363
Yeah.

226
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:25,824
We gotta find somebody
to clean up the tape.

227
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:29,453
Isolate the sound.
Maybe do something to the voice.

228
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:34,375
I gotta get going.
Barnes is watching me like a hawk.

229
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:35,751
Yeah. All right.

230
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:37,336
Hey.

231
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,421
You've done more than
any partner could ask.

232
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:41,882
From now on, stay away from me.

233
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:45,427
For your own sake. If Loeb is behind this,
you don't wanna be mixed up in it.

234
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,221
What're you gonna do?

235
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,642
I still have some friends
I could ask for help.

236
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,979
Where're you going? Jim!

237
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:05,990
Hi, Ed.

238
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:15,165
- Please. Please, don't hurt me.
- No, relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.

239
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,001
- I need your help.
- My help?

240
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:18,919
I didn't kill Pinkney.
You have to believe me.

241
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,921
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

242
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,798
I need to find the man who framed me.

243
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,175
Whoever it was,
he covered his tracks well.

244
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:26,802
But I have something.

245
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:33,058
A recording of his first call to IA.
IA secretly records everyone who calls in.

246
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,394
They do?

247
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,689
Those sneaky little buggers.

248
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,194
Uh, and what did-- What did you hear?
If you don't mind my asking.

249
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:48,449
Not much. He disguised his voice.
But there are other sounds on the tape.

250
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:52,661
I figured, you work with audio.
I was hoping you could help me.

251
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:55,080
Jim.

252
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,209
My friend, you've come to the right place.

253
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:02,921
Please, have a seat.

254
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:12,973
I will get my stuff and make some tea.

255
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:23,442
Mmm.

256
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:32,660
Well, let's pray Helga hasn't signed on
anywhere new yet.

257
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,579
It's a family recipe.

258
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,581
I'm sorry you don't like it.

259
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,584
<i>I'm sure my cooking
will improve over time.</i>

260
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,920
Mmm, it's not that bad.

261
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:50,302
Tomorrow, you need to go
to the butcher.

262
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:56,600
I'd like a nice roast for Sunday dinner.
Not your slut mother's goulash.

263
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,604
A nice roast. Yes, ma'am.

264
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:05,776
Oh, and clean up this mess tonight.
I can't stand the sight of dirty dishes.

265
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:18,997
Oops.

266
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,297
Oops.

267
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:32,052
Good shot, Charles.

268
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:38,809
Okay. I must get to these dishes.

269
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:42,646
But, this has been delightful. Really.

270
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,525
Yes, it does sound like a bird.

271
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:52,281
And he's doing his best to mask his voice.
It's too bad the quality's so poor.

272
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,824
Uh...

273
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:57,077
Well, I'm afraid it's a dead end.

274
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,079
We should at least clean the tape.

275
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,914
Right.

276
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,092
You need some more tea.

277
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,766
So, the person who killed Pinkney
and framed you,

278
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:22,186
is the same person
that attacked the art museum

279
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,855
and planted the bomb in the train station.

280
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,525
Amazing. And you don't have any leads?

281
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:33,280
I think Loeb was behind it.
Payback.

282
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,409
He still has lackeys in the GCPD.

283
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:41,038
- Is that so?
- Everything points to a cop.

284
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,624
Or someone who worked
with the police, had access.

285
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,878
You all right, Ed?

286
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,548
Right as rain. Just thinking.

287
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:55,761
Surely, you don't think
that Loeb killed Pinkney himself?

288
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:59,389
No. He had some psychopath do it for him.

289
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:04,228
"Psychopath" seems a strong word.

290
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:09,316
He bludgeoned a man to death
with a crowbar in cold blood.

291
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:10,901
He's sick.

292
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:15,113
You say that, yet, you've killed
lots of people, haven't you?

293
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,243
That was in the line of duty.

294
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:24,581
And a person who would kill
in cold blood is a psychopath.

295
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:30,254
See, I-- I knew the rumors weren't true.

296
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:35,092
What rumors?

297
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,010
About you killing Galavan.

298
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,430
You would never do that.

299
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:44,184
<i>That would make you
like the people that you're hunting.</i>

300
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:47,855
<i>Sick. Diseased.</i>

301
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,692
Thar she blows.

302
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,112
Shut up, you're talking too much.

303
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,116
Ed, did Penguin ever say
anything about that night?

304
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:00,325
Hmm?

305
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:04,121
Did Penguin ever tell you anything
about the night that Galavan died?

306
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,456
No. Remember?
I nipped that friendship in the bud.

307
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:09,960
And you didn't talk to him in the GCPD?
When Barnes brought him in?

308
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:13,422
Yes. No. I-- Just to say hi.

309
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:16,091
Oh, tape's finished.
I'm gonna give that a listen.

310
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,344
Let's both listen.

311
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:21,555
Swell idea.

<i>I--</i>
<i>I want to report a crime.</i>

314
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:43,827
<i>I saw Detective James Gordon
shooting Mayor Theo Galavan</i>

315
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,287
<i>on the Southside Docks.</i>

316
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:50,042
<i>The Penguin was beating him with a bat,
but it was Gordon that pulled the trigger.</i>

317
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:58,675
It's not a bird.

318
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:01,970
It was mechanical.

319
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:05,599
Without fingers I point,

320
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,936
without arms I strike,
without feet I run. What am I?

321
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,024
- You're a clock.
- Correct.

322
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:17,527
I know it was you, Ed.

323
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,405
- Me?
- You.

324
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,799
Guess what?
I knew that you knew, that I knew.

325
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:54,606
That's why your chair's
wired to the mains.

326
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:08,161
<i>Over the pavement and down the alley</i>

327
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:11,748
<i>But why this wind is cold</i>

328
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:17,587
<i>It bites my toes and nips my nose,
as over the ground that we go</i>

329
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:24,177
I hope you like the outdoors, Jimbo.

330
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:27,264
I know just the spot.

331
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:42,154
Come out, come out wherever you are.

332
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:48,618
I bet you're wondering,
"Why would Ed do this to me?

333
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,290
"Set me up.

334
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,461
"Ruin my life."

335
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:03,091
I'll give you a hint, Jimbo.

336
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,927
K.K.

337
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:08,305
Kristen Kringle.

338
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:30,994
<i>Rats.</i>

339
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,041
<i>Hey, have you seen my jacket?</i>

340
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:39,920
It's freezing outside.

341
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:44,466
Sorry. I was fixing the sleeve.
You'd ripped it.

342
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:47,385
You know how to sew?

343
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:50,097
Alfred says it's an important skill
for young bachelors.

344
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:53,391
Okay.

345
00:23:58,772 --> 00:23:59,773
Hmm.

346
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:04,319
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

347
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,372
- What the--
- Detective Gordon.

348
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:20,460
Bruce? What are you doing here?

349
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,129
I could ask the same about you.

350
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:24,548
I found the man who framed me.

351
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:27,843
I need a phone--

352
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:34,057
Great, a dead cop in my crib now.

353
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:41,189
<i>Don't forget the cherries, Oswald.</i>

354
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:45,235
Oh. Right, cherries,
cherries, cherries, cherries.

355
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:58,915
<i>Oswald!</i>

356
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,547
Oswald.

357
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:07,966
My drink?

358
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:12,721
I'm sorry. There's no cherries.

359
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:14,472
No cherries?

360
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:18,894
The next time I ask for cherries,
there better be cherries.

361
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:24,107
Yes, Grace. Ma'am. Of course.

362
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:08,818
Mother said to remind you
of tomorrow's dinner.

363
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:13,156
- What's wrong with him?
- Who knows?

364
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:17,160
- Mother wants a roast.
- And make it good this time.

365
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:22,832
Yes, I will.

366
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:54,864
<i>He's still sleeping.</i>

367
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:56,700
Best thing for him.

368
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,705
Thank you for coming
when I called, Alfred.

369
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,207
Of course I came. No question.

370
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:10,839
You're looking thin.

371
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:15,427
- I'm getting plenty to eat.
- That I very much doubt, Master Bruce.

372
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,972
But there are things that we must discuss.

373
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:20,890
- I'm not coming back.
- I understand that--

374
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,100
- Not yet.
- But we need to talk--

375
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:23,476
- Alfred!
<i>- Good morning.</i>

376
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:26,730
Detective Gordon, should you be up?

377
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:30,233
- I'm fine. You stitched me up?
- Actually, it was Master Bruce.

378
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,736
He called from Selina Kyle's
when you passed out.

379
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:35,196
So I thought I'd bring you here.
Safest place for you.

380
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:36,740
Master Bruce,
I'm wondering if you might go

381
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:40,243
and get the detective his clothes
from the laundry room, please.

382
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:44,414
I'm glad you're okay.

383
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,419
<i>So, I'll make you some breakfast.
Take a seat.</i>

384
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,963
- Like some coffee?
- Yes, please.

385
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:56,051
There we go.

386
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:07,437
How long has Bruce
been living with Selina Kyle?

387
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,231
Ever since the Matches Malone debacle.

388
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,734
Turns out staring into the
cold, dead eyes of the man

389
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:16,654
that killed your parents
doesn't bring the right amount of closure.

390
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:20,492
Bruce never should've been in that room.
I should've gotten to Malone first.

391
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,285
Yes. You should've done.

392
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:25,455
But you didn't, did you?

393
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:27,957
Eh?

394
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:34,714
You can't un-fry an egg.
As my dear old mum used to say.

395
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:38,718
So, why don't we leave
Master Bruce's situation alone,

396
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:41,388
and why don't we discuss yours, eh?

397
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:44,474
It's a long story.

398
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:47,727
Right, so you were framed for the murder
of that other police officer.

399
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:49,354
You escaped from the prison,

400
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:51,773
you then tracked down
the man that framed you,

401
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,274
and you're promptly shot in the leg.

402
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:55,860
Right, so, answer me this, Detective.

403
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,697
Do you have any idea

404
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:03,451
how you're gonna get out
of this awful pickle?

405
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:06,663
Yes, I do.

406
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:09,999
Come, my dear.
Your future awaits.

407
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,251
You're sure?

408
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:16,005
I run a hospital, not a prison.
You're sane.

409
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:19,092
It would be unethical and illegal
to keep you confined.

410
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,094
- What if I--
- Hush, now.

411
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:22,929
Life is full of uncertainty.

412
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:26,266
And if something does happen,
we're always here.

413
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:28,685
Off you go.

414
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,568
If you keep releasing lunatics
so liberally,

415
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,820
you're going to get a bad reputation.

416
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:41,030
I'm not looking for a good reputation.

417
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:44,409
<i>We're releasing Barbara Kean into the wild
to observe her behavior.</i>

418
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,578
<i>- She's a beautiful experiment.</i>
<i>- Hmm.</i>

419
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:49,998
You know what she's going to do,
don't you?

420
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,083
I don't, actually.

421
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:55,545
But I do know it will be interesting.

422
00:29:58,339 --> 00:29:59,883
Nygma was right about one thing.

423
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,052
I can't just go to the cops.
They'll never believe me.

424
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:06,514
- I need hard proof.
- Cops, right? Jerks.

425
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,602
Nygma said he met Penguin
for the first time in the woods.

426
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,480
<i>That's right around the same time
his girlfriend went missing.</i>

427
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,941
I think he was burying her.
Just like he was going to bury me.

428
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,527
<i>What? You wanna find her body?</i>

429
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:22,280
Touch of the old "needle
in the haystack," isn't it?

430
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:24,324
Nygma knows where she is.

431
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,409
What? You think he's gonna, what?
Straight tell you?

432
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:29,204
That's exactly what he's gonna do.
But I need help.

433
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:30,914
Whatever we can do.

434
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:35,460
Thanks. But I need someone
Barnes knows will betray me.

435
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:44,052
What?

436
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,599
Who do I talk to about the reward
for Jim Gordon?

437
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,227
Hey! Psst. Come here. Come here.

438
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:54,979
- Come here. Come here.
- Let go of me! I'm here for my reward.

439
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,273
- I'll give you a reward.
<i>- Bullock!</i>

440
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:02,320
- Have you seen Jim Gordon?
- Depends. There really a ten grand?

441
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,614
Depends on your information.

442
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:07,617
He was at my place a couple of hours ago.
He'd been shot.

443
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:09,494
Shot? Who shot him?

444
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:11,829
<i>Didn't say.
He wasn't making a lot of sense.</i>

445
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:14,165
- Is he still there now?
- No, he took off.

446
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:15,416
I don't know where,

447
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,961
but he was just looking for a place
to lie low for a while, I guess.

448
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:20,088
That's not worth $10,000.

449
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:22,507
Fine.

450
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:25,843
Before he left he said he'd found out
where the Penguin was hiding

451
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,262
<i>and he was gonna go see him.</i>

452
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,763
<i>Why would he go see the Penguin?</i>

453
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,599
I don't know. Something about,
"Penguin knows where the body is buried."

454
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:33,393
- What bodies?
- I don't know!

455
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,812
- Where's the Penguin now?
- No one knows.

456
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:39,482
- You're gonna pay me or what?
- Or what?

457
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:50,827
Relax. Relax.

458
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,123
Maybe Gordon won't even find Penguin.

459
00:31:56,291 --> 00:32:00,169
You idiot. He's a detective.
He finds people for a living.

460
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:05,091
Penguin won't tell him.
He's my friend.

461
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:11,347
Who am I kidding?
You idiot. Stupid. Stupid!

462
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:15,476
Okay, okay.
Okay, calculate, cal-- Calculate.

463
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:19,897
Chances of Gordon finding Penguin,
let's say 80%.

464
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:23,735
Chances of Penguin telling Gordon,
also 80%.

465
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:27,447
So that's a 60% chance
of Gordon finding Kristen.

466
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:31,534
That settles it.

467
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:55,975
Hello, Kristen.

468
00:32:57,101 --> 00:33:00,063
I know, didn't expect to see me again,

469
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,650
but circumstances.

470
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:09,489
Now, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to move you.

471
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,285
Now--

472
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:24,879
Jim Gordon.
So you did find Penguin.

473
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:27,173
And that little bird sang.

474
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,467
No, I just followed you.

475
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:38,935
You fed information to that little
miscreant assuming that I'd hear.

476
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:42,605
Or no. No, no, no.
Of course, you were in cahoots.

477
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:43,898
Of course, you were in cahoots.

478
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,234
Well, either way, bravo, Jim.

479
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:49,278
I'd clap, but I have your gun in my hand.

480
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:51,280
How did this happen to you?

481
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:54,659
How did you become this?

482
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:59,163
You dummy, this is who I am.

483
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:03,084
It was just finally admitting
the truth to myself.

484
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,545
Well, that and murdering some people.

485
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:09,382
- I don't believe that.
- You don't believe it. Why, Jim?

486
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:12,135
'Cause it would make you incompetent?

487
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:14,637
To know that I was right
under your nose the whole time?

488
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:16,931
Or you don't wanna admit
that there's a monster in all of us,

489
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:19,434
because you, of all people,
should know that.

490
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:23,396
That's what made it so easy to frame you.

491
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:25,815
I was your friend.

492
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:28,609
Were you, Jim?
Were you my friend?

493
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:32,488
Or did you just pity me?
"Oh, poor, weird, little Ed.

494
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:36,909
"With his little, silly wordplay
and his little riddles."

495
00:34:37,535 --> 00:34:39,203
You're completely insane.

496
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:42,331
Yeah. It's probably easier
for you to think that.

497
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:48,212
How about one last riddle
for old time's sake?

498
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:52,425
"A nightmare for some.

499
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:56,429
"For others, a savior, I come.

500
00:34:57,388 --> 00:34:59,432
"My hands, cold and bleak,

501
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:03,144
"it's the warm hearts they seek."

502
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:06,105
Death.

503
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,025
Right again.

504
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:12,528
Goodbye, Jim.

505
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:14,363
<i>Drop the gun!</i>

506
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:16,032
Drop it!

507
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,869
Captain Barnes, I'm arresting Jim.

508
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:23,998
Stop it, Ed. We heard everything!
Now, drop the gun and get on your knees!

509
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:27,043
No, this is-- This-- I'm-- He's-- He's--

510
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:28,753
Last chance!

511
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:43,267
Oh, crud.

512
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:01,244
How is it? Not too gamey?

513
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:03,412
Hmm. Overcooked.

514
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:06,916
Try the other joint.

515
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:11,254
It is much more tender.

516
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:17,176
Hmm. It's the same.

517
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:18,427
Mmm.

518
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:23,099
Still, beats my slut mother's goulash, no?

519
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:27,270
Where are the children?
Ring the bell again.

520
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,106
Hmm. I doubt they'll hear it.

521
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:33,651
You look different.

522
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:35,820
You noticed!

523
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:40,908
Yes. I'm doing my hair a different way.

524
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:45,997
Charles! Sasha! Where are they?

525
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:49,876
I found the sherry decanter, Grace.

526
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:54,881
The one with poison in it
that you used to kill my father.

527
00:36:58,009 --> 00:37:00,011
What on Earth are you talking about?

528
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:02,513
You should've thrown it away.

529
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:06,559
Guess you're a little too mean
to waste good poison, huh?

530
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:10,730
Don't go.

531
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:13,024
Charles! Sasha! Help!

532
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,651
- They won't come.
- Where are they?

533
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:19,447
You thought they tasted the same.

534
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:21,657
But Sasha--

535
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:24,535
Mmm.

536
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:28,164
- No. No. No.
- Definitely more tender.

537
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:29,665
- No!
- In my opinion.

538
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:32,543
No! No!

539
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:35,838
<i>You said you were innocent.
And you were.</i>

540
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:38,257
I'm glad.

541
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:40,676
I guess I owe you an apology.

542
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:44,263
No. You were doing your duty.
Can't fault you for that.

543
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,516
Ah, well, I owe you one.

544
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:50,186
Not necessary. But I'll take it.

545
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,189
Can you do me a favor,

546
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:56,150
and take it easy on Bullock?

547
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,236
Thanks.

548
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:02,698
So, when are you coming back to work?

549
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:08,162
- I'm not coming back. Not yet, anyhow.
- No?

550
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:10,998
There's something I have to do first.

551
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,885
Lee Thompkins' number.

552
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:26,389
She's working for
an M.E. Department down south.

553
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:34,021
I promised Bruce Wayne
I'd solve his parents' murder.

554
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:36,399
<i>I have to do that first.</i>

555
00:38:37,108 --> 00:38:38,609
Then, I'm free.

556
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:44,281
The Wayne case is closed, Jim.
The perp is dead.

557
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:46,742
But who hired him? Why?
I need to find out.

558
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:49,745
Sometimes we never find out.
It happens.

559
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:53,499
I need you to give me the Wayne files.

560
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,837
You take this
and I'll give you the Wayne files.

561
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:03,509
Call her.

562
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:06,887
<i>I'll go get 'em.</i>

563
00:39:17,273 --> 00:39:19,984
It was nothing that you did
or didn't do, Alfred.

564
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:23,362
Why I went away.
I want you to know that.

565
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:25,239
I do.

566
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:27,616
Thank you very much.

567
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,660
I'll be going back to the city
as soon as Selina's ready.

568
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:31,954
She's just taking a hot shower.

569
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:33,456
Hmm.

570
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:39,837
You do know that Mr. Lucius Fox
fixed your old man's computer

571
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:41,422
a couple of days ago, don't you?

572
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,923
And when were you going
to tell me, Alfred?

573
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,802
Well, I tried telling you this morning.
I'm telling you again now, aren't I?

574
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:49,805
- Don't--
- What're you doing?

575
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:52,641
She could walk in here.
Have a word.

576
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,478
- I trust her.
- It's about trust, is it?

577
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:58,898
Look, whatever your father was doing,
he did it in secret for a reason.

578
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:00,858
To protect those he loved.
And it's got--

579
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:03,319
It doesn't matter about
my personal opinion about that young girl.

580
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:05,988
But she has been a bloody good friend
to you and she's been loyal.

581
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:07,782
So, I'm gonna let you go ahead.

582
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,451
Continue your father's work.
I can't stop you.

583
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:12,328
I mean I've tried, haven't I?

584
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:16,624
But I will not have you put that
little girl's life in danger.

585
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:20,169
It's either the work or it's her.

586
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:22,838
Can't have both. Do you understand?

587
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:26,509
Ugh! Man, rich people
have great water pressure.

588
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:32,223
So, Jeeves, any chance
we can get a ride back to the city?

589
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:38,062
Right, well, I'll be in the...
In the kitchen, Master Bruce.

590
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:41,190
Miss.

591
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:47,488
What's with him?

592
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,078
Bruce, what's going on?

593
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:00,084
I'm not going back.

594
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:01,877
What?

595
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:06,549
I'm grateful for everything
that you taught me.

596
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:09,552
My place is here.

597
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,974
So, that's it?

598
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:20,563
Wow.

599
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:22,314
I don't expect you to understand.

600
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:24,441
Right, 'cause you're Bruce Wayne
and I'm street trash.

601
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:26,777
- Selina, it's not like that.
- Yeah, it is.

602
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:30,447
It is.

603
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:33,868
It's fine.

604
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:36,620
Have a great life, Bruce Wayne.
