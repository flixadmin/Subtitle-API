1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:03,913
<i>Time travel is real,</i>

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,996
<i>and so are its consequences.</i>

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,706
<i>When a terrible time paradox
put all of history in peril,</i>

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,336
<i>an elite team was formed.</i>

5
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,134
<i>Theirjob? To protect history</i>

6
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:14,588
<i>and repair these
so-called anachronisms.</i>

7
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,764
<i>Unfortunately, this is
not that elite team.</i>

8
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:20,935
<i>And yet, this team of misfits
and outcasts is determined</i>

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,683
<i>to fix the history
which they have broken.</i>

10
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:26,892
<i>Not because they are heroes,
but because they are legends.</i>

11
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,172
<i>Previously
on</i> Legends Of Tomorrow...

12
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,404
Seeing Stein
with his grandkid earlier...

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,482
You two are inseparable.
Literally.

14
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,362
I want to break up Firestorm.

15
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,784
<i>The totem's strength grows</i>

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,079
<i>when the threats that you must face
become more powerful.</i>

17
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,703
But you cannot face
this new threat alone.

18
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,165
That amulet... It's a totem.
We're bound together, somehow.

19
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,417
Cut the crap
and tell me what we're facing here.

20
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,378
That information is need-to-know.
The only thing you need to know,

21
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,551
your ridiculous team
could never handle it.

22
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,591
They're the reason Mallus is a threat.

23
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,469
And there just might come a day

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,142
when we need the Legends
to do what they do best.

25
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,535
You best stop following me, guv.

26
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,873
That is a most impressive scream.

27
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,755
In another era, you could have
a career alongside Vincent Price.

28
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:42,267
Rigor mortis hasn't set in.
He's been dead less than four hours.

29
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,061
Extreme pallor in the face
and fingernails suggests

30
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:48,060
rapid blood loss,
yet not a drop to be seen.

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,110
Killed off-site, his body dumped here
far from the illustrious streets

32
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,653
of his upbringing. A handkerchief
with his college crest.

33
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,072
A graduation gift, no doubt.

34
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,785
What do you make of that?

35
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:07,583
Improbably, it appears that
our killer is a vampire.

36
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,869
<i>You sure you want to do this?</i>

37
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,094
Break up Firestorm?

38
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:20,343
I'm sure Grey wants off this ship
and I'm sure that can't happen

39
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,344
if we're still bonded
to each other, so...

40
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,016
Yeah, but your bond isn't
just physical.

41
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,414
You guys have been psychically bonded
for over three years.

42
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,930
Yeah, and it's been no picnic,
let me tell you.

43
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,565
Last time I got laid, afterwards,
Grey said to me,

44
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,443
"Well done, Jefferson." I mean...

45
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,316
Could've done without knowing that.

46
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:41,326
Does Grey, I mean, Marty know that
you want to break up with him?

47
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,745
No clue, but if he did,
he'd say it was too dangerous.

48
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,697
Well, if you're really determined
to do this,

49
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,580
severing your psychic connection
could give us some much-needed

50
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,754
mental space to figure out
how to untie the nuclear knot.

51
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,796
- Well, let's do it.
- Okay.

52
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,924
Here goes.

53
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,298
Oh! I forgot that there might
be a couple side effects.

54
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,761
What side effects?

55
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,097
Um, just like, you know,
facial swelling,

56
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,144
maybe a little gastrointestinal upset.

57
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,375
Oh, and short-term memory loss.

58
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,265
- How do you feel?
- Uh...

59
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,061
Normal, except
I'm not craving grapefruit.

60
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,608
Okay.

61
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,283
Ray, it's 9:00 a.m.
and I'm not craving grapefruit.

62
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,784
Mmm. Delightful.

63
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,207
Let me get this straight. This ship
can make any kind of food

64
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,001
you can imagine, and you three
picked grapefruit,

65
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:36,081
a bran muffin and oatmeal.

66
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,507
After you try everything,
you go back to the basics.

67
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,054
I lived my whole life
eating rations and bland food.

68
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,053
From now on, I eat like a queen.

69
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,927
I'm glad you left 2042.

70
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,889
Actually, I wanted to talk to
you guys about going back to 2042.

71
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:56,021
Or better yet, 2041.

72
00:03:56,111 --> 00:04:00,276
I was thinking, why is my family dead
when I'm on a time machine?

73
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,358
Unfortunately, that's not
how this works.

74
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:04,943
I thought you could change the past.

75
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,619
We can correct the past
and the future, but...

76
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,864
- We don't change it.
- Why not?

77
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,702
Because doing so could cause unforeseen,
possibly even disastrous consequences.

78
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,663
It's a temporal butterfly effect,
if you will.

79
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,117
Try not doing something
that would save your brother's life.

80
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,217
Does a sister count?

81
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,717
<i>Wassup, shipmates!</i>

82
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,721
I got exciting news to share.
Team meeting in 10 minutes.

83
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,679
<i>And, Mick, I have beer.</i>

84
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,521
One lousy beer for breakfast.

85
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,696
It's breakfast?

86
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,467
Yeah. What time
did you go to bed last night, buddy?

87
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,824
I didn't. Drank a lot of coffee.
Can you tell?

88
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,750
Nate, why are we staring at
an anachronism map?

89
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,120
Because, Cap'n, I did
a deep dive on the data,

90
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,994
and the anachronisms we created
at first glance seem scattershot,

91
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,625
random, but since history
is cause and effect,

92
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,543
I decided to do a little experiment.

93
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,839
I folded the linear timeline onto
itself, following the mathematics

94
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,837
of the golden ratio. Follow me.

95
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,930
Damn it, Gideon, that was your cue.

96
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,882
<i>My apologies, Dr. Heywood.</i>

97
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,684
Ah. See, the anachronisms
form a pattern.

98
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:13,998
I should have guessed.

99
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,481
Though time may be broken,
like all matter in the known universe,

100
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,980
<i>it still possesses
a mathematical harmony.</i>

101
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,983
Not exactly. What about those two?

102
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,358
Those two are outliers.
First one is Seattle, 2042.

103
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,655
When the assassin tried to kill me.

104
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,704
Right, while cool, not the part where,
you know, you almost got killed,

105
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,577
it's not as cool as the other one.

106
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,377
London, 1895. How do I say this?

107
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,748
There's a vampire.

108
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,672
<i>Half dozen men snatched off
the streets...</i>

109
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,463
<i>Only to have their bodies dumped
three days later</i>

110
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,512
- completely drained of blood.
<i>- Vampires.</i>

111
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,297
Waited my whole life to kill one.

112
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,071
Do you just carry that around
all the time?

113
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,429
My whole life.

114
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,519
<i>There's no such thing as vampires.</i>

115
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,395
Increased immigration
at the <i>fin de si√®cle</i>

116
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,474
and the fear that good Englishwomen
would lose their virtue

117
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:03,357
to foreign predators is responsible
for these ludicrous stories.

118
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,780
I say we go see what's so interesting
about this anachronism.

119
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,955
Victorian London. Opium dens
and low-cut corsets.

120
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,832
Arthur Conan Doyle
and the rolling fog.

121
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,460
Syphilis, whores and vampires.

122
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,167
That's a strong smell of garlic.

123
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,005
It's tied around my neck.

124
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,962
Yeah, you're a regular Van Helsing.

125
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,092
That's from <i>Dracula.</i>

126
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,844
I'm reading it.
Don't tell me the end.

127
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,267
Another vampire victim found
dead in the street.

128
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,852
Oi! Give me that.

129
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,875
Whoa. Vampires, what the hell
is he talking about?

130
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,357
The blood-sucking creatures
that we're here hunting.

131
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,309
Oh, no.

132
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,104
Short-term memory loss,
one of the side effects of the serum.

133
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,276
Shh. Come on.

134
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,365
- Who are you lot?
- Oi. Scotland Yard.

135
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,375
We're here to see about
these so-called vampire attacks.

136
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,952
And we're with the NYPD.

137
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,565
Nothing like a bit of cooperation

138
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,149
- from across the pond, right?
- Uh-huh.

139
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,382
This one of the victims?

140
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,337
Unlucky devil.

141
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,178
Whoa! Mick!

142
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,104
You don't want him
coming back to life, do you?

143
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,011
What's going on here?

144
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,058
Scotland Yard has already
visited twice,

145
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,933
and if the NYPD is issuing
ladies warrant cards,

146
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,140
then I'm the bloody Queen.

147
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,156
All right, who brought their phone?

148
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,233
Wasn't me. Even though
I do love that song.

149
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:37,410
It's not a phone. It's a 2016
Palmer Tech 7G smart watch.

150
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,952
Hand it over.

151
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,666
I don't know what you're on about.

152
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,169
You want some of this?

153
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,299
Who does that watch belong to?

154
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,928
No? All right. Mick, stake him.

155
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,797
All right, all right.

156
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,804
A vicar was walking down the street,
as calm as can be,

157
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,352
when a dead man fell from the sky.

158
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,521
<i>It wasn't no normal corpse neither.</i>

159
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,021
No identification, strange clothes
and that there watch.

160
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,477
Which you stole.

161
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,152
He wasn't gonna miss it.

162
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,482
I will, though. That is
the finest timepiece I've ever seen.

163
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,157
It did sell better in England.

164
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,618
So where's our John Doe now?

165
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,364
Uh, I buried him in Stone's Hollow,

166
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:24,543
and the next day, the first vampire
victim was snatched from the street.

167
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,417
'Cause that corpse you buried
was a vampire from the future,

168
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,544
- you idiot.
- All right, time to go.

169
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,595
Who are you lot?

170
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,505
Tonight, we're grave diggers.

171
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:44,014
All right, we're looking for one
unmarked grave among hundreds.

172
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,440
I say we split up,
check them row by row.

173
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,940
Or we can start with the one
that's already dug up.

174
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,606
Yes. Ah!

175
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,408
The vampire must have dug himself out
before nightfall.

176
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,612
Damn it, that anachronistic corpse
was our only lead.

177
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,666
Wait, did you hear that?

178
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,628
Kill it, kill it.

179
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,676
- Rip.
- Rip?

180
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,765
- Welcome to London.
- Listen, Englishman.

181
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,560
Those time pigs try to take me,
I'll burn 'em alive.

182
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,900
The Time Bureau are not actually
aware of my current whereabouts,

183
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,061
and as surprising as this may sound,

184
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,022
I need the Legends' help.

185
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,835
Ms. Jiwe, I was surprised to hear
that you'd rejoined the team.

186
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,378
It's surprising me too.

187
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,626
I trust we're not under arrest?

188
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,799
- Far from it.
<i>- Rip?</i>

189
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,378
Rip, where the hell
did you come from?

190
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,465
- Where did he come from?
- Where do any of us come from?

191
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,266
You know, what are the odds of that one
lonely sperm

192
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,185
meeting with that one special egg?

193
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,605
You know, us science types are always
still wrestling with the big questions.

194
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,899
We've answered those questions,
Dr. Palmer.

195
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,236
Mmm-hmm.

196
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,314
I need Jackson's help with this.
There's some GPS data on here,

197
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:20,071
and, um, it might be able to tell us
where our dead man walking came from,

198
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,279
and, uh, where he's going. Or her.
So, yep.

199
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,229
Oh, man, the short-term memory loss
is worse than I anticipated.

200
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,994
Marty's definitely gonna notice.

201
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,375
It's okay, uh, I got this.

202
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,923
I'll just write myself a note,
like, "Rip's back."

203
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,922
- Excuse me, what's going on?
- Nothing, man.

204
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,507
You're acting awfully strange.

205
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,098
- It's... Temporal dysplasia.
- Temporal dysplasia.

206
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,765
You know how that is.

207
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,184
Mmm-hmm.

208
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,600
- Lily.
<i>- Dad.</i>

209
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,478
- Is everything all right?
<i>- Ronnie won't sleep.</i>

210
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,855
<i>Your lullabies
are the only thing that work.</i>

211
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,900
All right. Excuse me, priorities.

212
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,608
All right, little guy, it's time
for you to go to sleep.

213
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,325
<i>Hush, little Ronnie</i>

214
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,115
<i>Don't say a word</i>

215
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,745
Come on, man.

216
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,457
All right, we'll continue
with the plan.

217
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,459
But not until we figure out
whose watch this is,

218
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,665
which could be difficult.

219
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,361
Digital Digest gave
my software encryption

220
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,001
a five-padlock rating.

221
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,347
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

222
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,016
I didn't realize that you were praying.

223
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,061
Mecca's that way. I was just
looking for my earring.

224
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,628
I wanted to talk to you about before.

225
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:33,609
I know that it's tough.

226
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,133
That I'm not allowed to save
my family? Yeah, it's real tough.

227
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:39,530
You should take comfort that your
brother wanted you to have that totem.

228
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,942
You reclaimed it.
It's your birthright.

229
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,995
- It's your family...
- Stop talking about my family

230
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,946
when you're telling me
I can't save them.

231
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,210
What the hell was that?

232
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,913
This is the reason I asked you
to stay aboard the ship.

233
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,173
The reason that
I haven't returned home.

234
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,715
- We're connected.
- What for?

235
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,886
I don't know. I was hoping that
we could find that answer together.

236
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:17,860
Not to be overly sentimental, but, uh...

237
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,107
I've missed this place.

238
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,784
We'd love to reminisce with you
but your Time Bureau is on our tail.

239
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,701
Makes us slow to help you out.

240
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,326
I'll get down to it then.

241
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,352
When I permitted the Legends
to keep the <i>Waverider...</i>

242
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:32,867
Nobody permits us to do anything.

243
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,498
I had an ulterior motive.

244
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,204
Why does that not surprise me?

245
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,716
For the last five years,
I've been chasing a phantom.

246
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:44,591
A name whispered across time
and in every language.

247
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,343
Mallus.

248
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,432
A phantom mollusk, an evil shellfish?

249
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,853
"Mallus."

250
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:58,559
An evil so ancient and powerful that the
Time Masters dared not speak his name.

251
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:01,612
Now, I believe that
he is recruiting allies

252
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,655
from throughout time to his cause.

253
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,360
Now, anachronisms are the result
of your breaking time.

254
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,660
Her idea.

255
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:13,081
But these outliers, they are most
certainly the work of Mallus.

256
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:18,504
Now, the Time Bureau is a bureaucracy
and lacks the imagination

257
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,922
to understand this particular threat,

258
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,755
and Director Bennett
objects to my crusade.

259
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,510
Hmm.

260
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,220
I'm alone out here.

261
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,428
So, what I'm hearing is, your hot
new girlfriend dumped you,

262
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,081
<i>and now
you're crawling back to your ex.</i>

263
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,894
And I am no one's side piece.

264
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,192
You know, I think they're
on to something here.

265
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,028
Look, sweetie.

266
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,401
We would love to take you back,
but we don't know

267
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,198
how we could trust you again.

268
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:52,533
Would circumstances be any different
if I were to call off

269
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:56,242
my hot new girlfriend's
pursuit of you?

270
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,126
Mmm...

271
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,081
Deal.

272
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,718
All right, what's your plan?

273
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:11,469
Right, this outlier, the vampire
is most likely the objective of Mallus.

274
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:12,893
<i>Catch the vampire.</i>

275
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,269
Catch Mallus.

276
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,347
Sounds like we're gonna need
vampire bait.

277
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,362
Me?

278
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,104
Is it 'cause I'm handsome?

279
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,234
Pretty.

280
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,698
Pretty handsome.

281
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,908
Overcrowding and poverty made
Whitechapel a breeding ground

282
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:42,212
for criminal activity, culminating
in the Ripper's murders right around,

283
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,298
well, now.

284
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,382
Isn't history fascinating?

285
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,258
It certainly is.

286
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,088
Trusting the Englishman
was a damn mistake.

287
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,048
You know we're all on comms,
don't you, Mr. Rory?

288
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,259
I don't give a rat's ass.

289
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,310
No sign of any vampires.

290
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,351
I wish this was like
a Kristen Stewart type.

291
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,475
All broody and sparkly.

292
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,434
Vampires don't sparkle.

293
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,363
You know, Mick, you
and the vampire have a lot in common.

294
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,775
You both like to sleep in
and, you know,

295
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,944
kill people.

296
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,871
Stein? What are you doing out here?

297
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,339
Looking for you, dear boy.

298
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,263
Nate. Nate?

299
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,135
We seem to have lost Dr. Heywood.

300
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,687
- Nate, answer me.
- Look.

301
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,977
- He's got Dr. Heywood.
- Let's cut him off.

302
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,046
Well, that was invigorating.

303
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,382
<i>- Did you find Pretty?</i>
- No, we lost him.

304
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,004
We found potatoes.

305
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,428
Never fear.

306
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,810
The game's afoot.

307
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:41,286
"Methought I heard a voice cry,
'Sleep no more.'"

308
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,617
Professor Stein?

309
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,045
No, Shakespeare actually.

310
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,208
And it's "Sir Stein" to you.

311
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,169
It's not every actor who is knighted.

312
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,424
Oh, God, this can't be happening.

313
00:16:55,515 --> 00:17:01,637
Thanks to your life blood, my master
will finally make his return.

314
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,847
But there's much to be done
in the meantime.

315
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,441
Oh.

316
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,652
Yeah, well, that wasn't creepy.

317
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,908
<i>- Sara?</i>
- Nate.

318
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,951
- Where are you?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

319
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,371
But I just had a chat
with Professor Stein's

320
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,039
weird lookalike evil cousin.

321
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,242
<i>Great-great-grandfather,
to be exact.</i>

322
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,578
<i>The famous stage actor,
Sir Henry Stein.</i>

323
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:28,753
Astonishing.

324
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,257
The chances of us running into
one of my ancestors

325
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,959
are astronomical.

326
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,342
Family lore recalls him as being
an eccentric.

327
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,014
But then what can one expect
from an actor?

328
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:43,685
He's also an occult weirdo
who kidnapped me to feed his master.

329
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,309
Excellent! The vampire
will lead us to Mallus.

330
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,668
Stay where you are, Dr. Heywood.

331
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,127
Yeah, that's not gonna be a problem.

332
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,643
Whatever they roofied me with
fritzed out my powers.

333
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,151
<i>- Can you describe where you are?</i>
- Uh, I think...

334
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,618
An operating room? All I know
is there's a spooky-ass

335
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,071
red moon painting on the wall.

336
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,083
- What's that?
- It's some of my research on Mallus.

337
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,749
"Beware the blood-red moon
when the door

338
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,422
"that separates death from life
will be opened."

339
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,130
It's the first line of an oath taken
by the Order of the Shrouded Compass,

340
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,463
an infamous secret society
of London's aristocracy

341
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,048
obsessed with the occult.

342
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,537
That sounds like the perfect place
for an out-of-time vampire

343
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:24,561
to take refuge.

344
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:29,352
The Order also believe in the magical
properties associated with...

345
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,230
A total lunar eclipse.

346
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,859
Which is set to occur right here
in London tonight.

347
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:57,342
If I wasn't vampire hunting, I'd rob
these rich bastards blind.

348
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,921
Hunting a tiger for sport,
it's just perverse.

349
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,243
Can't believe we're in a time where
women can't vote and the Internet's

350
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,267
not a thing.

351
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,559
Savages.

352
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,098
Anyone doesn't have a reflection,

353
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,274
they're getting a stake.

354
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:17,397
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have
your attention please?

355
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,026
Truly uncanny.

356
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,779
It's that 'stache that's astonishing.

357
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,657
I know you're not here
for idle chit-chat

358
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,579
and aperitifs.

359
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,325
<i>So please allow me to introduce
the star of the evening.</i>

360
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:34,129
A famed mystic who has come
all the way from America

361
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,754
to communicate with the dead.

362
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,505
Madame Eleanor.

363
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,722
Can't believe people
are buying this garbage.

364
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,978
I sense...

365
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:56,272
Someone in the room who longs
to speak to a departed loved one.

366
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:03,901
Come, sit at my table
if you have no fear.

367
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,532
Since we can't hack the watch
for its GPS data,

368
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,867
we're gonna have to solve this one
the old-fashioned way.

369
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,543
With fingerprints.

370
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,001
Okay, we got
the coroner's fingerprints.

371
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:20,835
And the second one is mine, obviously,
and the third one is unidentifiable,

372
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:24,592
and the fourth one is Oliver Queen.

373
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,725
Oliver's a time-traveling vampire
from the future?

374
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,269
We gotta call Team Arrow,
figure out what the heck's going on.

375
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,647
<i>Return of the Mack</i>

376
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,526
<i>Pump up the world</i>

377
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,522
<i>Return of the Mack</i>

378
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,648
<i>Watch my flow</i>

379
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,447
<i>Return of the Mack
You know...</i>

380
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,074
About time.

381
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,945
<i>I'm as excited as you are.</i>

382
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,742
But we all must wait for
the blood-red moon

383
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,827
before the ceremony may begin.

384
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,791
Oh!

385
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,213
Gross.

386
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,879
If you need me,
I'll be right over here.

387
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,887
Sara. I could really use
a rescue right now.

388
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,430
We're working on it.

389
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,469
Do you remember our mission
from the Greyhill building?

390
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,103
Like it was yesterday.

391
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:18,735
Excuse me.

392
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,153
Could you tell me where
the powder room is?

393
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,946
Oh, I've missed this.

394
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,660
Everyone, please, join hands.

395
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,082
There is a doubter among us.

396
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,799
I too was a skeptic once.

397
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,760
Before the spirits spoke to me.

398
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,559
But now...

399
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:54,595
I am their conduit.

400
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,201
Kahar.

401
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,493
Do you remember the night
they came for us?

402
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,212
How fast you ran.

403
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,711
You abandoned me, <i>Khaahar.</i>

404
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,174
You let them kill me
so you could live.

405
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:39,356
- No...
- You are scared now.

406
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,857
Just as you were scared
of A.R.G.U.S. then.

407
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,947
So much fear.

408
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,735
You were my big sister.

409
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,826
You should have protected me.

410
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,203
- Please...
- Stop this at once.

411
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,626
You heard the lady.

412
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,497
<i>Sara, our cover is blown.</i>

413
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:04,798
<i>We need to leave.</i>

414
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,755
Wait, the vampire, that was you?

415
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,639
A two-pronged needle
by my own invention

416
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,592
is hardly vampiric.

417
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,018
Then who's the stiff?

418
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,854
Nate, are you okay?

419
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,181
Does it look like I'm okay?

420
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,688
Instead of a sexy vampire,
I get stuck with this weirdo.

421
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,403
He's all yours.

422
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,662
The Order has plans for our
time-displaced corpse.

423
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,276
<i>That's why they're kidnapping men
and draining their blood.</i>

424
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,707
<i>It's for their ceremony.</i>

425
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,372
Shall we find out who it is?

426
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,753
<i>Whoa! Guys, I am digging the digs.</i>

427
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,529
<i>I mean, I have some serious
lab envy over here.</i>

428
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,885
Yeah? Well, check this out.

429
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,391
<i>Whoa. Okay, well, I've analyzed
that unidentified print</i>

430
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,514
<i>and got back 100,000
possible variations</i>

431
00:23:58,604 --> 00:23:59,664
<i>on a complete friction ridge.</i>

432
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,725
Okay, so do we have a match?

433
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,353
<i>Unfortunately. I hope you guys
have a bar on that ship,</i>

434
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,777
<i>because you're gonna need a drink.
The watch belongs to...</i>

435
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,366
Damien Darhk.

436
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,950
Darhk must be integral
to Mallus' plan.

437
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,286
We can't leave Damien Darhk's
body to be resurrected.

438
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,917
Darhk may be a madman
but he's not the madman

439
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,293
we're presently after.

440
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,597
Guys, we have definitely
overstayed our welcome.

441
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,142
Fall back.

442
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,015
The hell is going on?

443
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:46,975
We're not killing vampires anymore?

444
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,482
Captain Lance, need I remind you
we are no longer just fixing

445
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,778
ordinary anachronisms here.

446
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,738
Mallus is the only game that matters.

447
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:56,318
No, it's your game. We have to stop
Damien Darhk from coming back to life.

448
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,412
And we will.

449
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:01,285
But from all indications, Mallus
is coming here to recruit Darhk.

450
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,742
If we destroy Darhk's body,
we destroy any chance

451
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,730
of apprehending Mallus
at the resurrection ceremony.

452
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,041
If Sara says kill Darhk,
or re-kill Darhk,

453
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,110
or prop him up in a convertible
like <i>Weekend at Bernie's,</i>

454
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,672
that's what we do, because
she's the captain.

455
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,629
I know that you all want
to destroy Darhk once and for all.

456
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,786
You're just gonna have to be patient.

457
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,054
I'd like to speak to you in private.

458
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,303
Good luck in there.

459
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,892
I'm not letting Damien Darhk
come back to life.

460
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,486
- Full stop.
- You've lost perspective.

461
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,940
You're letting personal prejudice
cloud your judgment.

462
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:39,404
If I had, I wouldn't have put
Damien Darhk back into the timeline

463
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:44,161
and erased his memory so that
he could kill my sister again.

464
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,117
Look, Sara...

465
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:51,081
I understand how perilous it would be
for Mr. Darhk to return.

466
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,258
Do you?

467
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,085
Because I am the only one
in this room that's been resurrected

468
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,886
and it wasn't an improvement.

469
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,298
You're right.

470
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,926
You're right.

471
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,855
You've got to understand, Sara,
that I've been chasing Mallus

472
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,064
for so long

473
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,102
that perhaps it is I
who's lost perspective.

474
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,000
Never gonna learn
how to knock, are you?

475
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,292
I'm concerned about you.

476
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,874
I know that you think that
woman channeled your brother.

477
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,044
His name was Behrad.

478
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,635
The night A.R.G.U.S. came for us,
I ran.

479
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,893
I knew he was staying to fight,
but I was scared.

480
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,141
I left my brother there to die.

481
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,480
<i>You happy?</i>

482
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,736
Now you know my secret.

483
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,319
- Sorry.
- Yeah, I don't want this anymore.

484
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,280
Whatever's going on with it,
or with us,

485
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,736
I don't care.

486
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,868
That totem is your only remaining
connection to him.

487
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,201
It's not a connection,
it's a reminder.

488
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,666
That I should have been the one
who died.

489
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,798
You know...

490
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,302
It's kind of weird not being able
to sense Stein's emotions.

491
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,468
Don't tell me you're missing
your psychic connection?

492
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,727
Oh, come on, of course not.

493
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,768
- Well, maybe a little, but...
- Aha!

494
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,059
I've uncovered your ruse.

495
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,894
- You've been using my lab.
- Your lab?

496
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,945
To impede our psychic connection.

497
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,364
It's the very foundation
of Firestorm.

498
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,281
Actually, that's the foundation
of Firestorm.

499
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,205
It's the formulae for building
a thermocore.

500
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:50,580
No, playing hangman.

501
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:51,955
"Q."

502
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,088
Grey, don't take this out on Ray.

503
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,462
He was just helping me figure out
a way we could...

504
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,214
Break up Firestorm.

505
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,421
So that you could go home
and I could stay on the ship.

506
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,051
Oh, I see.

507
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,850
So, are you cool with this?

508
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:12,097
Why wouldn't I be? After all,
you've only been here tinkering,

509
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,602
in secret, with how to split up

510
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,105
a walking, talking,
living nuclear reactor.

511
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,523
- Of course I'm "cool with it."
- Okay.

512
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,446
After everything we've been through,

513
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:25,072
how could you attempt something
of this magnitude behind my back?

514
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,078
Grey, it's not like...

515
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:39,215
Oh, it seems we both share
a craving for solitude.

516
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,214
- Is everyone aboard the ship?
- As far as I'm aware.

517
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,303
Is there something I can do for you?

518
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,637
In fact there is. Could you please
tell Captain Lance that...

519
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,219
I'm sorry.

520
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,138
- What are you doing?
- Gideon.

521
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,940
Initiate Gentleman's Dreadnought.

522
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:59,144
<i>Command code recognized.
Are you sure, Director Hunter?</i>

523
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,774
She left me no choice.

524
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,783
<i>- Seven, six...</i>
- Gideon.

525
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,111
<i>Five, four, three, two...</i>

526
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,288
- It's Mr. Hunter.
- What's he done?

527
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,426
- All the exits are locked.
- And I can't override the command.

528
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,879
- Damn it, Rip.
- Told you we should never

529
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,700
have trusted the Englishman.

530
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,056
Where's Zari?

531
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,307
<i>Come in.</i>

532
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,978
I was hoping we might meet again.

533
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,492
You channeled my brother earlier.
I need to talk to him again.

534
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,862
Oh, I'm sorry.

535
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,324
I cannot merely summon the dead
at whim.

536
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,785
Please, I need to tell him
that I'm sorry,

537
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,163
and I have a way to bring him back.
I can save him this time.

538
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:02,961
I could try.

539
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,169
I would need a memento,

540
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:10,132
something that belonged to him
that I could focus my energy on.

541
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,052
Would this work?

542
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,105
So much power.

543
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,864
And you give it away so easily.

544
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,203
A mistake you're unlikely to repeat.
Hmm?

545
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,961
Madame Eleanor,
the blood-red moon beckons.

546
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:45,926
Restrain her.

547
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,136
I must prepare for the ceremony.

548
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,306
Damn, Gideon, how many secret commands
did Rip program you with?

549
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,287
<i>I believe this was
the last of them, Captain.</i>

550
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,645
Well, I'm captain now
and I order you to override Rip's orders

551
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,393
and ready the ship for take-off.

552
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:00,769
<i>Right away, Captain Lance.</i>

553
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,569
<i>Director Hunter's command allows you
to fly the</i> Waverider,

554
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,111
<i>just not let any of you off of it.</i>

555
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,689
Well, it's a start.

556
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,303
Plot a course for
the Shrouded Compass.

557
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:10,984
Damn right, <i>Capitaine.</i>

558
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,195
And bring the ship's
weapon system online.

559
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,406
Needless to say, it's highly likely
that Mr. Hunter is in that building.

560
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,241
And I'm willing to bet
that so is Zari.

561
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,292
You want an omelet,
you gotta crack a few eggs.

562
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:46,235
When you welcomed me to the Order
you were seeking proof.

563
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:50,197
<i>Evidence that life does not have
to end with death.</i>

564
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,286
But the power that courses through
my veins is not mine own.

565
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,706
It is a gift from Mallus.

566
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:09,216
Stop this abomination!

567
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,761
Everybody down, now!

568
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:23,269
Your so-called master, where is he?

569
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,816
Mallus is everywhere and nowhere,

570
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,019
refracted in every moment of time.

571
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,773
He is dead, he is risen.

572
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,074
And he will come again.

573
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:38,781
Right, that's very cryptic,
but I demand to speak to him.

574
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,285
Oh.

575
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,491
Oh, very well.

576
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,928
Director Hunter.

577
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,430
Pleasure to meet you.

578
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,934
Oh, I'm not here to speak
to your puppet.

579
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:04,264
I think it's about time
you and I met face-to-face.

580
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:09,439
You could not look upon
my true form and live.

581
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,902
While you are hopelessly mortal,
I am a god.

582
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:28,524
You're too late.

583
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,734
It's good to be back.

584
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,114
Who stole my watch?

585
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,547
Our coordinates say we're right
above the Order.

586
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,871
Prepare the shock missiles.

587
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,874
- Three pages left.
<i>- What are you doing?</i>

588
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:10,000
Zari's in there.

589
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,335
I need you to target the cargo bay.

590
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,917
- Our cargo bay?
- Shouldn't we have a team vote first?

591
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,198
If anybody has a better idea
how to get the ship open,

592
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,508
now's the time.

593
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,969
Trust me, Jax, fire.

594
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,479
<i>Shock missiles away, Captain.</i>

595
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,646
Oh. This is gonna suck so bad.

596
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,648
Uh, Grey, if we're gonna die,

597
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,698
I don't want us to go out mad
at each other, so...

598
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,340
I can't remember what for,
but I'm sorry.

599
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,573
You were just thinking of me.
Actually, I should be thanking you.

600
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,451
- Aw. Who wants to hold hands?
- Ray, it's not friggin' <i>Toy Story 3.</i>

601
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,282
Everyone, shut up.
I got one page left.

602
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,863
Any last words, Rip?

603
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,744
Yes, I remember you.

604
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,871
I remember everything.

605
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:18,591
Remember us?

606
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,963
Oh, goodie, more Legends.
Here to kill me, I assume.

607
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,218
This time it'll stick.

608
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,519
That's my totem.

609
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,327
Let's go.

610
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:52,501
Till we meet again.

611
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,023
- Mmm. Not bad. A little tart.
- If you can believe it,

612
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,904
Clarissa prefers to eat her grapefruit...

613
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,951
With salt. Yeah, I remember.

614
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,328
How?

615
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,915
I got Ray to restore
our psychic connection.

616
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,085
I can feel how much you're missing
your family.

617
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,585
Ever since baby Ronnie
was born, it's only gotten worse.

618
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,460
It's like there's a hole in my chest.

619
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,751
I'm so sorry.

620
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,964
I never expected the birth
of my grandson

621
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,151
would make being away
that much more painful,

622
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,560
and I certainly never
wanted you to share this burden.

623
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,564
But with this new Mallus threat,

624
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,103
and the return of Damien Darhk,

625
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,776
the team needs Firestorm
more than ever.

626
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:03,104
Yeah, and the team can get Firestorm.

627
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,780
And you can go home.

628
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:08,405
If we can stabilize the matrix
into my body.

629
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,247
T.S. Eliot once said, "Only those
who risk going too far can possibly

630
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,746
"find out how far one can go."

631
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,452
So, when do we start?

632
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:22,957
As soon as I, uh, fix that giant hole
in the cargo bay.

633
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,758
- Well, good luck with that.
- Yeah.

634
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,266
<i>Yeah.</i>

635
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,515
Knock, knock.

636
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,900
Still not knocking.

637
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,322
You wanna sit?

638
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,861
Sure. Thanks.

639
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,992
This is gonna sound weird, but...

640
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,866
When my amulet came back to me,

641
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,289
I felt Behrad's presence,

642
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,250
like, almost like he was with me.

643
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,464
That doesn't sound weird at all.

644
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:08,219
First A.R.G.U.S.,
then that Water Witch

645
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:11,297
and now some formerly dead guy
all wanna kill me.

646
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:14,975
My ancestor told me that
the totem strength grows

647
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,474
when the threats we face
become more powerful.

648
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,556
Fantastic.

649
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,733
I think what she meant is that...

650
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,986
You and I are gonna become
great friends,

651
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:29,114
and we'll defeat whatever
evil comes, together.

652
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:31,613
I like that.

653
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,545
We need to talk.

654
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,587
By now you know me better
than to expect an apology.

655
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:49,885
Agents are dead because of you.

656
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,429
They understood the risks
of their profession.

657
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,509
But we learned so much
from the events of last night.

658
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,562
- Next time...
- There won't be a next time, Rip.

659
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:05,233
You show up out of nowhere,
practically begging for our help,

660
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,936
and then you betray us.

661
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,068
You've gone rogue from every
organization that you've ever been

662
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,158
a part of.

663
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,824
'Cause you don't trust anyone.

664
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,365
I don't know how I could've
ever trusted you.

665
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,657
Sara, I need you with me now
more than ever.

666
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,413
Do you remember when you told me
you had nothing left to teach me?

667
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,327
I guess you had one final lesson.

668
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,876
How to be a cold son of a bitch.

669
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:33,963
Director Bennett.

670
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,764
Director Hunter.

671
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,182
You've called in your last chit.

672
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,431
I should never have sanctioned
last night's mission.

673
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:43,807
But the mission proved
that Mallus is real.

674
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,641
Explain it to the tribunal.

675
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,519
In the meantime, you are being
detained and suspended

676
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:49,979
from active duty.

677
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,106
You can't detain me.

678
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,862
I created the Bureau!

679
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:57,696
Then you of all people should know
that no one is exempt from its rules.

680
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,827
Agent Sharpe.

681
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,339
Thank you for notifying us
of Director Hunter's whereabouts.

682
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,921
Now the Legends
are free to fly the skies?

683
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,127
Affirmative.

684
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:16,722
The Time Bureau has bigger things
to worry about than a bunch of idiots.

685
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,480
Mallus is getting stronger,
Captain Lance.

686
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,227
<i>Last night was only the beginning.</i>

687
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:27,858
There is a war coming,

688
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,519
and history needs you to be ready.

689
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,488
You and the rest of the Legends.
