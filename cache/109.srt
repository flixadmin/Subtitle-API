1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,800
Eva, this is Iben. My girlfriend.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,780
It was just a hook up.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,860
You just follow what
everyone else thinks is exciting.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,920
Chris hooked up with
someone at the party. I saw it.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,640
You saw it?
-On the staircase.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,380
Staircase?!

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:25,860
I got an unpleasant phone call from the Rad girls 
saying that as long as Eva is on our bus, we're all blacklisted.

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,480
I don't understand why you're
attacking Eva, when they're the enemy.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,960
Jonas and Ingrid were a couple. So Eva has
herself to blame for the situation she is in now.

10
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,100
<i>[PS: On the back there's
a greeting in period blood.]</i>

11
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,480
Hi.

12
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,520
Hi.

13
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,440
You were right.

14
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,260
The Rad girls are after the entire bus.

15
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,860
Whatever. I'm not on the bus anymore.

16
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,340
Why not?

17
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,620
Why bother being on a 
blacklisted bus where everyone hates me?

18
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,660
There is no one who hates you, Vilde.
-Sana made it pretty clear.

19
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,380
Anyway, I'm back with Pepsi Max.

20
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,460
Vilde!

21
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:56,900
I just want you to know I'm not
the type of person who steals other people's boyfriends.

22
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,380
What kind of person are you then?

23
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:35,160
When I think of Foss, I see
a dude jamming on his guitar.

24
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,200
When I think of the entrance,
I see those majestic stairs.

25
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,600
I strongly recommend this school.

26
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,280
<i>[Hi! I would like to change high school in the middle
of the school year.]</i>

27
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:46,620
<i>[Immediately. From Nissen to some place else. 
Preferably Foss. Or Elvebakken.]</i>

28
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,460
Hi.
-Hi.

29
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,140
You weren't at school today.

30
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,940
No.

31
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,440
It's really unfair
that you get this much hate.

32
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,840
I have decided to change schools.

33
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,040
Why?

34
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,220
Because everything is fucked at Nissen.

35
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,180
And that's why you're changing schools?

36
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,140
Yes.

37
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,420
Okay..

38
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,140
Okay what?

39
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,420
It's just not typical of you.

40
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,060
What is that supposed to mean?
-I didn't know you were someone who would just give up.

41
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,280
What is this bullshit about what kind of person 
I am? Maybe I am somoeone who gives up!

42
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,960
I don't know! Why would
you know what kind of person I am?

43
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,200
Everyone is like: "What kind of person are you?
You have to know who you are!" What a fucking cliche.

44
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,440
Yeah, ok.

45
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,320
Just chill.

46
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,840
I didn't mean it like that.

47
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,520
Sorry.

48
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,700
No..

49
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,000
It's actually not that complicated, Eva.

50
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,800
It's just what people do.

51
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:41,640
If you want to change schools because
things are a little fucked up, you are someone who gives up easily.

52
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,940
I'm not five years old. You thought
reverse psychology would work on me?

53
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,880
I don't know. Does it?

54
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,840
You've got to fight back girl

55
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,960
Is there something?

56
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,220
Are you Maria?
Bus boss from Rad?

57
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,940
Yes.

58
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,100
I am Eva.

59
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,680
Okay.

60
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,680
I am that Eva.

61
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,760
Okay.

62
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,280
I just want to say that I got your letter.

63
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,100
I know I fucked up, but I think it's unfair
to blacklist the entire bus. My friends didn't do anything.

64
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,100
It was me. Take me, not them.

65
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,660
Okay, Eva..

66
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,900
You can say hi to your friends
and tell them we won't "take" them.

67
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,820
We have more important stuff
to do than blacklisting first years.

68
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,820
So, what's up with the letter then?

69
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,520
We haven't given you a letter.
Someone's fucking with you.

70
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,820
So you guys aren't mad
that I hooked up with Chris?

71
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,740
Eva, we don't give
a shit who you've hooked up with.

72
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,680
Even Iben's boyfriend?

73
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,580
Even Iben's boyfriend. Eva, listen.

74
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:24,680
I'm sure that in your head, this hook up is the
 most important and dramatic thing you've done in your life's story..

75
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,540
But for us who have been here
for a while, it's only a little comma. 

76
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,000
So I suggest you accept these terms, okay?

77
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,420
Okay.

78
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,600
And relax.

79
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,720
You shouldn't care. Youre in
the first year. You'll hook up a lot.

80
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,060
But don't sleep around. There's a difference.

81
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,700
When we were in our first year,
we had a chlamydia epidemic. 

82
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,340
Did you find out who started it?
-It was William.

83
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,480
It wasn't William.

84
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,540
Chris had it too, right?

85
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,920
It was one of the guys for sure.

86
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:21,500
<i>[Inaudible.]</i>

87
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,800
I see what you did wrong.
-I didn't do anything wrong.

88
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,220
You did it completely wrong, Sana.
-The answer key is wrong.

89
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,640
The answer key isn't wrong, Sana.
-It is! Because it doesn't have the same as me.

90
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,000
Hi!

91
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,620
Hi.

92
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,680
I talked to the Rad girls.

93
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:57,760
They aren't after us.
-Now I can finally breathe again!

94
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:05,880
It's Vilde who cares about that stuff and
is pees her pants about some blacklist.

95
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,560
She isn't on our bus anymore.

96
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,360
Huh?!

97
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:21,880
She said she didn't want to be 
on a bus where everyone hates her.

98
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,220
Something's wrong.

99
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,380
At the bus meeting, she was mean.
And Vilde isn't a mean person.

100
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,780
What?

101
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,860
It seems like you just defended Vilde?

102
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,100
I'm just saying something's wrong.

103
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,920
We are her friends.

104
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,060
You guys should pay more attention to her.

105
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,960
Okay..

106
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,240
You guys..

107
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:11,300
I feel like I owe you an explanation.
About what Vilde said about me and Ingrid.

108
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,600
But I don't have one.

109
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,920
I know I should've done things differently.

110
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,920
Save that speech for Ingrid.
-Fuck Ingrid!

111
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,460
You don't owe her shit. She was sucking up
 to Iben and hooked up with Chris herself.

112
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,760
I'm sure it was her
who sent the period letter.

113
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,320
What are you saying now?
-You don't think it was her? I think so.

114
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,420
Has Ingrid hooked up with Chris?

115
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,700
Yes, I saw it at the Halloween party.
I saw her and Chris making out on the stairs.

116
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,260
Are you kidding me?
-No, I saw it!

117
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,980
And you're telling me this now?!

118
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,640
What? I've told it before.

119
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,380
I thought I told it before.

120
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,020
We have to talk.

121
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:27,540
Unless you want me to tell
Iben that you hooked up with Chris.

122
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,880
I know you don't want
to listen to me, but you have to.

123
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,180
Whether you want to or not,
we'll be going to the same school the next three years.

124
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:52,320
You can't continue trying to block me out, 
throw shit, or send me threat letters.

125
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,080
Just hear me out, okay?

126
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,060
I moved here from Bergen in the 7th grade..

127
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,320
No one wanted to hang out with me
because I talk so weird.

128
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,860
You were the only
one who took care of me.

129
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,500
I remember how proud and lucky..

130
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:37,320
I couldn't believe the most popular girls 
in our class wanted to be friends with me.

131
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,840
I always really looked up to you.

132
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,740
You're the best
friend I've ever had.

133
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,960
Just the thought of me destroying that..

134
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,140
.. makes me feel sick.

135
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,900
More than sick.

136
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,800
It made me stop
liking myself as a person.

137
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,420
But I can't continue having
 regrets for the rest of my life.

138
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:42,300
It wasn't going well between you and Jonas.
You talked about breaking up with him every day.

139
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,040
I know that's not an excuse, but..

140
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,960
I loved him.

141
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,420
I wish I could do it
all over again, completely different.

142
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,500
But I can't.

143
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,480
I'm just going to have
to accept it and move on.

144
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,240
I'm saying this for the last time.

145
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,720
Okay?

146
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,040
I'm sorry.

147
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,780
I'm sorry that I lied
and went behind your back.

148
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,220
I'm sorry that I ruined our friendship.

149
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,580
You didn't deserve it.

150
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,260
I'm not trying to say you should like me.

151
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,460
Or that we should be friends again.

152
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,700
I just..

153
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,680
I can't bear any more threat letters, okay?

154
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,660
Okay.

155
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,900
No more shit.

156
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,540
But I didn't send a threat letter.

157
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,520
And I barely knew Iben when I hooked
up with Chris at the Halloween party.

158
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,780
Fucking hell!

159
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,080
Seriously?

160
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,260
You have serious issues.

161
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:51,440
What's wrong with you?
 You can't just jump on people. Pull yourself together.

162
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:59,420
You're with the school's largest douche. Your way
of coping with it is to jump people and send threat letters?

163
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,300
I have a better suggestion for you..

164
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,020
Break up with your fucking
boyfriend. He's a fucking asshole.

165
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,160
I didn't mean it like that.

166
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,380
Yeah, I'm fine.

167
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,280
I know it's true, so..

168
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,360
I just..

169
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,360
I think you deserve better.
Everyone deserves better than that.

170
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,220
I love him.

171
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,000
Maybe he'll change.

172
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,620
It was good that he told you.

173
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:06,960
What?

174
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,120
That he had cheated.

175
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,700
He didn't tell me?

176
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,480
He didn't?
-No.

177
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,900
Some people told me that's
how you knew about it.

178
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,960
That your boyfriend told you.

179
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,300
My boyfriend?! It was
your boyfriend who tipped me off.

180
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,220
My boyfriend?

181
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,580
Yes.

182
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,400
But my boyfriend didn't even know.

183
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,420
He must've done it.
It was him who sent the tips.

184
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,520
That's how I found about it.

185
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,380
Huh?

186
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:58,020
The little blonde one. The one
you're always with. Isn't he your boyfriend?

187
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,100
Isak Yaki? Isak?
Isn't that what he's called?

188
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,860
Did Isak sent the tips?

189
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,220
I thought you knew.
