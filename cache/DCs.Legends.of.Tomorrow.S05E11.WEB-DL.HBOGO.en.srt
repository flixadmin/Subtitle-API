1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,600
- Hey.
- I have Mace, jackass.

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,960
Oh, it's you.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,720
Listen, sorry I didn't make
your thing last week.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,120
I was stuck in Hell.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,400
- Don't sweat it, I didn't miss you.
- Right.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,440
Your mom said I could have
the weekend.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,360
Maybe we could bond, do stuff.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,560
Come on, I'm trying.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,880
All right, what is our
father-daughter weekend

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,960
gonna look like?

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,240
I got tickets to the roller derby.
Should be lots of blood and cleavage.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,720
I, I just remembered I actually
have a big history test on Monday,

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,200
so I can't. I gotta study.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,440
Study.

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,200
Very important, study. Yes.

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
Right.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,360
What's that?

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,640
- That's a time machine.
- Is this...

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
Can I see it?

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,280
I thought you had to study.

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,280
Well, it could be useful
for a history test.

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,320
Basically, this bucket of bolts
can travel anywhere in history.

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,360
We can catch a show
with The Ramones or Sabbath.

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,480
- Some Lita Ford of The Runaways?
- That, too.

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,040
You know, I have been fighting
so hard to get you out of Hell

26
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,160
and you are finally here.

27
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,600
I bet you're the only one
on this ship

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,680
who's happy to see me.

29
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,200
Oh, nonsense. As far as this sorry
lot are concerned,

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,000
as soon as anyone stops trying
to murder them on a weekly basis,

31
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,800
- they're best friends.
- Either way,

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,960
I am gone
the second Charlie uses that Loom

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,720
- to bring my mom back.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,760
What's she doing?

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,560
She said she wanted to get
into the right headspace, so...

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
I totally get that.

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,920
There's nothing like a 20-second
meditation micro-sesh to zen out.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,480
Did we miss the weaving?
I hope we didn't miss the weaving.

39
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,720
- Gary, what, you have a dog?
- What?

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,720
We don't have dogs.
This is not a dog place.

41
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,280
- I have a letter from my therapist.
- We don't have therapists either.

42
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,680
Well, we should.

43
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,840
Going to Hell
generated a lot of anxiety.

44
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,440
Well, this says
this is his emotional support animal.

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,200
- It's signed and everything.
- I don't have time for this.

46
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,000
I've named him Gary Junior.

47
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,360
He's made a tiny tinkle.

48
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,280
He isn't ship-broken.

49
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
Junior!

50
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,960
He's usually a very good boy.
Everyone, watch your step.

51
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,840
Chasing tail now, are we, Gary?
That's a first.

52
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,680
- Wait, wait, wait, don't...
- Bollocks.

53
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,760
Gary!

54
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,320
All right, almost ready.

55
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,120
I think. It's been a few millennia.

56
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,600
Okay, so, who's gonna
get the first weave?

57
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
- Her mother.
- Behrad.

58
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,160
Behrad first, John.

59
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,600
Yeah, look, well, I...

60
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,400
I made a promise to Astra, love.

61
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,440
I'm with Zari.

62
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,000
- Behrad.
- Who's Behrad?

63
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,640
I did not come back from Hell
to take a number and wait my turn.

64
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,960
He is my brother and he's part
of the team that found the rings.

65
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,280
We're getting him back first.

66
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,600
Okay, stop, stop.
Everybody, stop arguing.

67
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
You're all gonna get a chance.

68
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,080
But Sara's in a coma.
Charlie's gonna weave her out first.

69
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,840
All right, enough. Come on, guys.

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,520
This is exactly why I should have
left the damn thing broken.

71
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,360
Okay, I'm gonna choose. It's Behrad.

72
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,880
Now, goggles on, and let's get going.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay.

74
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,560
The ring of Clotho,
the maker of threads.

75
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,120
And extremely rad dresser.

76
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,360
The ring of Lachesis,
the weaver of destinies,

77
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,320
and a manipulative control freak.

78
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,040
And the ring of Atropos,
the cutter of threads,

79
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,800
and a heartless psychopath.

80
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,160
(Foreign language)

81
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,720
I see Behrad's thread.

82
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,920
But it's a bit of a tangled mess.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,160
It's probably
because of all the time travel,

84
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,120
but I think it'll be all right.

85
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
All right.

86
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,080
Gideon, status.

87
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,640
{\an5}- Gideon?
<i>- Still assessing the damage,</i>

88
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,720
<i>Ms. Sharpe.
Running on backup power.</i>

89
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm sorry, Z.

90
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,120
- What happened?
- It didn't work.

91
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,680
- Okay, so we try again.
- I said it didn't work.

92
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,440
{\an5}I've never tried to use the Loom
without my sisters.

93
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,880
- I guess, I need them.
- Then let me try it.

94
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,320
{\an5}Lachesis said she was preparing me
to be a Fate. Maybe I can...

95
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,680
{\an5}Yeah, go ahead if you wanna
burn up from the inside.

96
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,560
Okay, what are we supposed to do?

97
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,200
Right now, we're just gonna sit tight
and try to fix the ship.

98
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,920
Well, that's great.

99
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,080
{\an5}I could do some research
back at the house,

100
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,320
{\an5}see if there isn't another way
to harness the rings.

101
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,400
I could use another set of eyes.

102
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere
until Behrad's back.

103
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,800
{\an5}Wait. So, I left an empire in Hell
for "sit tight,"

104
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,840
for "do some research"?

105
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,040
Not good enough.

106
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,120
<i>Apologies,
but no one's going anywhere.</i>

107
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,040
{\an5}<i>The energy burst
created an anti-chronotomic field.</i>

108
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,760
<i>Time travel functions are offline.</i>

109
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,000
So, no Jumpships, no Time Couriers?

110
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,120
{\an5}- All out of commission.
- Great.

111
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
We're stuck.

112
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,640
Why are the lights out?

113
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,800
The ship better not be broken.

114
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,440
<i>Unfortunately, I am.</i>

115
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,400
{\an5}<i>I was damaged in an explosion
caused by the Loom of Fate.</i>

116
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,840
You're kidding me.

117
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,120
I promised the kid we'd time travel.

118
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,920
Now she's gonna fail her exam.

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,440
Nope, it's fine. I'll be okay.

120
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,880
{\an5}We have to find you a room
to study in.

121
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,160
Did the computer
just say "Loom of Fate"?

122
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,280
Things are really bad, baby.

123
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,880
Ship's broken.

124
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,400
{\an5}The Loom backfired
and almost killed Charlie.

125
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,240
{\an5}Everybody's bickering.

126
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,280
{\an5}The chances of getting Behrad back
have never felt more slim.

127
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,120
We could really use your vision.

128
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,760
I could really use you.

129
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,920
Oh, my God, Sara, you're awake.

130
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,680
Ava?

131
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,920
I can't see anything.

132
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,640
Gideon, what's wrong with her eyes?

133
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,520
<i>Unfortunately, Ms. Sharpe,
at my current power levels,</i>

134
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,640
{\an5}<i>I am unable to offer a prognosis.
I'm sorry.</i>

135
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,800
You're sorry?

136
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,120
What are you talking about?
She's blind.

137
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,880
{\an5}Reroute some power, Gideon.
Do something.

138
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,400
{\an5}Ava, It's okay, all right?

139
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,120
- It's probably just temporary.
- What if it's not? Lay back.

140
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,000
Who knows what else
is wrong with you.

141
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
Sara?

142
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,040
You were startled when we touched.

143
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,880
- What happened?
- Nothing.

144
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,320
- Are you hiding something from me?
- Always.

145
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Come on, Sara.

146
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,960
Babe, it was just a weird reaction
to waking up from a coma.

147
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,560
Whoa, no, no, no.

148
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,040
Where do you think you're going?
You can't see.

149
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,880
I trained in a blindfold for weeks
in the League of Assassins.

150
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,320
And nobody knows
how to fix the ship like I do.

151
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,120
Except for maybe Ray and Jax.

152
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,720
And Rip and Stein.

153
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,160
I guess Behrad's not bad either.

154
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,920
But you know what? None of them
are walking through that door,

155
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,680
so let's go.

156
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,320
So, what did I miss?

157
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,480
Oh, nothing much, actually. Just...

158
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,320
Hey, Mick.

159
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,920
Hi.

160
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,520
Oh, Lita, this is Sara Lance,
the captain.

161
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,080
Sara, this is Lita, my kid.

162
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,480
Nice to meet you.

163
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,480
<i>It's really cool
that there's a woman in charge here.</i>

164
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,000
- What, sorry?
- I just said that it's really cool

165
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,400
that there's a woman in charge here.

166
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,040
- Yes.
- Good, good to see you.

167
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,560
- Yes, it is.
- Come on.

168
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,360
What are you not telling me?

169
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,520
What are you not telling me?

170
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,160
- There's a kid on the ship?
- I...

171
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,920
And a dog? Ava?

172
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,600
Gary has an emotional support animal.

173
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,160
He had a signed letter.

174
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,720
- That's not a thing.
- I don't know, baby. Come here.

175
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,440
Is that Behrad?

176
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,640
He sounds like a pretty nice guy.
Were you two close?

177
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,960
No. But we were starting to be.

178
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,400
I only just learned about
this big life he was living

179
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,120
and then I lost him.

180
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,400
But I'm getting him back, so...

181
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,640
Yeah, about that.

182
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,360
I think I might have a way to do it.

183
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
I'm listening.

184
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,000
You know, I think I'm probably good
for my test tomorrow.

185
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,760
I'd kind of just like
to look around the ship.

186
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,160
You got to hit the books.

187
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,680
Punched him, Elbowed him.

188
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,720
Made out with her.

189
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,160
Okay, smart guy.

190
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,880
We're studying the French Revolution.

191
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
I've heard of it.

192
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,240
So, I have to compare and contrast

193
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,160
the American Declaration
of Independence

194
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,160
and the French Declaration
of Rights of Man and Citizen.

195
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Right.

196
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,240
So, does anybody on the ship
know history?

197
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
I know a guy.

198
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,040
Did I hear someone say

199
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,200
the Declaration of the Rights
of Man and Citizen?

200
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,920
Hi. Dr. Nathaniel Heywood.

201
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,440
I specialize in deductive
historical reconstruction.

202
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,640
Now, while technically I am a doctor,
you can call me Professor.

203
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,480
Or Steel because...

204
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
I turn into it.

205
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,000
You're the coolest professor
I've ever met.

206
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,280
Most likely, yeah.

207
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,520
All right. Let's study.

208
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,360
Well, we can't study
without snacks, right?

209
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,600
Gideon makes the best snacks.

210
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,080
- Really? Can we have Ants on a Log?
- Okay, Ants on...

211
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,600
Mick, can you be an absolute peach
and run to the Fabricator for us?

212
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,160
Now, what's happening
with your sight is a mystery, love.

213
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,840
Are you experiencing
any more effects?

214
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,080
No, nothing.

215
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,560
Oh, well, we'll just have
to wait and see then.

216
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,200
And there is one other matter
to discuss.

217
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,480
Astra Logue is on the ship.

218
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
What?

219
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Ava?

220
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,600
Sorry, babe, but there was
just never a good time to tell you.

221
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,920
She was only supposed
to be here temporarily

222
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,080
and then the Loom didn't work.

223
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,000
She cannot be on the ship.

224
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,720
I mean, what if,
what if she goes on a stabbing spree?

225
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,240
A stabbing spree? Well, that seems
a little excessive, honey.

226
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,000
Look, she's made her choice.
She decided to throw in with us.

227
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,240
Now, why would you doubt her word?

228
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,800
Look, I don't know, okay?
It's just...

229
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,680
it's a feeling.

230
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,400
John, I need you by her side 24/7.

231
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
Fine.

232
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,240
What if Charlie
just wasn't warmed up?

233
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,800
She tried to reweave
the most complicated thread

234
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
right out the gate.

235
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,240
What if she tries
with an easier thread?

236
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,440
One that hasn't been complicated by,
well, time travel.

237
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,920
Like your mother's?

238
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,640
Exactly.

239
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,120
If she succeeds
on an easy thread like hers,

240
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,720
she might be ready
to try Behrad's again.

241
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,400
The thing is,...

242
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,880
if it comes from me,
they might not buy it.

243
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
But if it comes from me...

244
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,280
they just might.

245
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,720
<i>Again, I do apologize</i>

246
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,160
<i>that the Fabricator
is not functioning, Mr. Rory.</i>

247
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,160
Oh, man. Must have been damaged
in the explosion.

248
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,000
Ants on a Log?

249
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,560
Are those for sharesies?

250
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,280
My kid.

251
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,400
I see what's happening here.

252
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,440
You're new
to this whole parenting thing.

253
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,840
You know what?

254
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,920
I think you need some advice
from the Papa Gare.

255
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,560
Parenting is about doing
the crap work.

256
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,040
No matter how degrading,

257
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,280
and never, ever once
hearing a word of thanks.

258
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,920
But you'll know in your heart
that they appreciate it.

259
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,400
Even if the thought
never crosses their mind.

260
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,840
Isn't that right, Gary Junior?

261
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,640
Duty calls, as they say.

262
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,720
Crap work.

263
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,600
What is that?

264
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,160
Okay.

265
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,160
I've removed panel 16-QW45G.

266
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,400
No, I'm pretty sure I said 16-QW45T.

267
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,480
No, you said "G."

268
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,320
- No, 16...
- Okay. Yep. Finding T.

269
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,720
Sara?

270
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,320
Caught a case of blindness, I hear.

271
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,320
Yeah, and while Gideon's down,

272
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,840
I'm stuck like this,
but it's no big deal.

273
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,280
No big deal?

274
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,800
Right, you're the first mortal
to ever see a God's true form

275
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,600
and live to tell the tale,
and that is no big deal.

276
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,120
It's no big deal.

277
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,720
So, nothing else
has been happening, right?

278
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,520
There's no other side effects?

279
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,640
Look, I know you're not
being honest with me, Sara.

280
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,360
I just wanna help.

281
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,080
What is she talking about, babe?

282
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,520
Look, it's nothing, okay? I just...

283
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,120
I didn't wanna upset anyone.

284
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,320
What's so upsetting?

285
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,640
When I touch somebody,
I see people stabbed to death.

286
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,960
But it's probably
just some subconscious fear

287
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,200
that's being kicked up by the coma.

288
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,480
It's like a, It's a nightmare.

289
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,920
You've lost one kind of vision,
and you've gained another.

290
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,200
Sara, you're seeing the future.

291
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,640
Look, they're just nightmares,
Charlie.

292
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,160
This can't be the future, all right?

293
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,920
- It's not possible.
- Why?

294
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,960
You're a Paragon of Destiny
who got radiated by godly light.

295
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,520
Why is it so impossible that
you've gained the gift of foresight?

296
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,000
Because we don't all die.

297
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,240
"We"? What do you mean, like,
we die in, like, 50 years,

298
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,160
or we die with me
wearing this exact outfit?

299
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Option two.

300
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,000
- It's got to be Astra.
- Charlie.

301
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,920
Would you stop with the Astra thing?

302
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,680
She saved our lives in Hell, okay?

303
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,200
I'm not gonna just assume the worst.

304
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,040
What, that she's
some manipulative psychopath?

305
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,120
Well, she just tried to manipulate me
into coming in here

306
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,960
and begging Charlie
to use the Loom again, so...

307
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,440
Okay, well, that's not a crime.

308
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,200
Guys, the rings.

309
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,680
They're gone.

310
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,720
I found this in the trash chute.

311
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,800
Okay, that is a crime.

312
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,320
Gidget, play back internal monitoring
of the parlor, please.

313
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,320
<i>My internal monitoring subsystems
have been disabled.</i>

314
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,760
<i>I'm afraid we have a saboteur
on board.</i>

315
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,880
Okay. Now I'm starting
to assume the worst.

316
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,200
Well, this was inevitable, wasn't it?

317
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,600
First thing that goes wrong,
and you all point the finger at me.

318
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,920
You know what, Astra? Slow your roll.

319
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,840
You wanted the rings
and now they're missing, so...

320
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,440
You're the only person
who doesn't belong on this ship.

321
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
Happily.

322
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,520
Look, I was with her the whole time,
all right? She never took the rings.

323
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,320
And besides, how is she supposed
to have sabotaged Gideon?

324
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,560
We have no idea, John.

325
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,880
That's why she's here
and not out the airlock, okay?

326
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,000
- Come on, babe.
- Sorry, Astra.

327
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,560
You just spent too much time
with my sisters to be trusted.

328
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,920
I was shown more hospitality
in the deepest pits of Hell

329
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,080
than on this ship of fools.

330
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,320
Yeah, just sit tight, all right?

331
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,520
I got just the spell
to track this saboteur.

332
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,240
I never should have trusted you.

333
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,480
Did you really, though?

334
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,800
Or did you just run out
of other options?

335
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,800
Then there's Zari.
She's from the future.

336
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,200
She's supes cute,
and she can control air.

337
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,720
- What?
- Yep.

338
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,360
Ants on a Log.

339
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,480
Everybody here has a superpower.

340
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,880
Do you have a superpower?

341
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,400
I have this.

342
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,160
- Your gun?
- Yes.

343
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,520
Your superpower is that you shoot
a gun?

344
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,840
- It shoots fire.
- No, I know. I don't like any guns.

345
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,680
- Why not?
- I marched in protest of them.

346
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,360
Do you know how dangerous
that thing is?

347
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,640
Well, that's the point.

348
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,120
Lita. Shut up.

349
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,240
You know,
if it wasn't for your pops here,

350
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,200
we wouldn't be able
to travel through time.

351
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,760
Mick keeps the lights on.

352
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Lights are off.

353
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,600
Oh, it's an unfortunate coincidence.

354
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,840
However, Mick funds
this whole operation

355
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,080
through the simple act of stealing.

356
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,200
Oh, didn't you go to prison
for stealing?

357
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,000
Isn't that why you missed
my childhood?

358
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,680
Damn it, Mick.

359
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,840
Sometimes they're just souvenirs.

360
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,000
Like, Mick, did you happen to steal
any French Revolution souvenirs

361
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,280
from Marie Antoinette?

362
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,640
Say yes.

363
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,440
Yes. Yes. Yes, I did.

364
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,600
- Really? Can I see them?
- Really?

365
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,040
Come with me.

366
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,120
Not bad, Nate. Not bad at all.

367
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,200
Not bad, Mick. Not bad at all.

368
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,880
- Well?
- Yeah, definitely sabotage.

369
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,280
Yeah, thought so.

370
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,120
What happened here?

371
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,120
We have a saboteur.

372
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,400
I think I know who it is.

373
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,400
Oh, come on.

374
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,320
Oh, hello, Zari.

375
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,840
Hello, Astra.

376
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,840
Look, I'm sorry you are locked up.

377
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,560
Well, at least we have that
in common.

378
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,080
We also both lost a relative
who we want back,

379
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,400
and got screwed when the Loom failed.

380
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,440
One of us more than the other.

381
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,560
Okay, I know John is out there
trying to prove your innocence,

382
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,440
but we both know how much
you wanted those rings,

383
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,960
so why not just give them back?

384
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,400
Oh, wait. I see now.

385
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,080
You think you're here
to interrogate me,

386
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,560
but that's not
why you're really here.

387
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,920
No, that's literally why I'm here.

388
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,560
You're here because you've got Nate
wrapped around your finger,

389
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,840
and you thought you had John
wrapped around your finger, too...

390
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,320
but you don't.

391
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,520
What are you talking about?

392
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,560
When we were choosing
who to weave first,

393
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,880
he picked my mother.

394
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,400
Not Behrad.

395
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,200
You think you clocked something
between John and I,

396
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,960
and now you're
using it to manipulate me.

397
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,400
You are devious.

398
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,000
So are you.

399
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,880
So why don't you use
that devious little brain of yours

400
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,240
and figure out
who really took the rings?

401
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
You think you can repair

402
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,200
the security cameras
to find our thief?

403
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,040
Maybe, but,

404
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,320
whoever did this left a lot of damage
and not a lot of clues.

405
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,080
It seems we've all arrived
at the scene of the crime.

406
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,240
Well, this crime, anyway.

407
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,520
You know, we could...

408
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,520
we could just work together
to find our ring thief.

409
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,160
Yeah, and how can I hope
to defend Astra

410
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,040
by teaming up with her accusers?

411
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,800
We're all looking
for the truth, John.

412
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,920
Yeah, well, some of us
can just see the situation

413
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,360
a little more clearly than others.

414
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,320
You okay?

415
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,680
- What's wrong?
- I...

416
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,080
it was me.

417
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,920
I killed everyone.

418
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,200
Baby, you are an amazing assassin,
okay?

419
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,840
But you're blind
and now you've warned us.

420
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,680
The idea of you
killing everyone is...

421
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
Arrogant? Delusional?
Just plain rude.

422
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,320
Yeah, and you're not
that kind of person.

423
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,560
Something is going on with me,
all right?

424
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,160
I went from seeing you all dead
to being the one responsible for it,

425
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,760
and I don't know why.

426
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,400
Look, you have to figure out
what is going on.

427
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,080
And until then,
I cannot be trusted, all right?

428
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,040
So promise me, no matter what I say,
you will not let me out of here.

429
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,840
Okay, I promise, honey.
I love you, all right?

430
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
We're gonna get
to the bottom of this.

431
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,360
Just please take a breath.

432
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,000
And what exactly
are we getting to the bottom of?

433
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,960
I have no idea.
She has lost her damn mind.

434
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,400
- Don't touch anything.
- Copy that.

435
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,000
You really like to steal.

436
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,080
Don't tell your mom. Here.

437
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,040
This belonged to the headless lady.

438
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,080
So, I really dig the whole
Scrooge McDuck aesthetic,

439
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,960
but why not put your money in a bank?

440
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,080
Bank?

441
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,040
Too easy to rob.

442
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,920
Hold on, all of your money is here?

443
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,320
What if somebody robs this?

444
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,000
- Let them try.
- What about compound interest?

445
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,680
Okay, how much money is in here?

446
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,480
Million? Billion.

447
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,080
And in 10 years,
how much is that gonna be worth?

448
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,880
The same.
It's gonna be worth the same.

449
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,680
If you invest it,
it'll be worth way more.

450
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,480
Sounds complicated.

451
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,640
What if you take the time machine

452
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,880
back to the start
of the New York Stock Exchange

453
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,160
and invest it all then?

454
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,200
We could go and buy Manhattan
in the 1600s.

455
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,080
We can invent Bitcoin.

456
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,920
We can become partners
in getting freaking rich.

457
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,720
What the hell?

458
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,280
Room's off-limits.

459
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,560
So, we're finally connecting,
and you're shutting me out?

460
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,000
You're a terrible father.

461
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,280
What are you doing?

462
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,440
Looking for footage
of you stealing the rings.

463
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,200
It doesn't exist.

464
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,680
Besides, I thought the cameras
were sabotaged.

465
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,600
I'm hacking the backup feed.

466
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,920
- You hack?
- Not so much me,

467
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,280
but a version of me
that used to exist.

468
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,280
Do you think I could talk
to this other version of you?

469
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,600
Maybe she'd trust me.

470
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,080
She wouldn't.

471
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,880
You know, you could gain trust
the normal way by being trustworthy.

472
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
Well, things are getting crazy
out there.

473
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,840
Sara just locked herself up.

474
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,440
Is locking someone up
her solution to everything?

475
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,480
She had a vision
that she killed us all.

476
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,680
Great. So I'm exonerated? I can go?

477
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,680
No, you're staying in time-out until
we find out where these rings are.

478
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,840
Speaking of which, backup feed is up.

479
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,720
Oh, my God.

480
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,560
Charlie, why'd you take the rings?

481
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,240
Mate, that wasn't me.

482
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,520
I mean, it was. But it wasn't.

483
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,040
That does not look good for me.

484
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,200
You disabled the cameras?

485
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,320
Are you two in cahoots?

486
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,880
- No.
- No, obviously not.

487
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,680
Why would I hack into footage
that incriminates myself?

488
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,760
I don't know.

489
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,520
I just destroyed the Food Fabricator.

490
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,440
Which makes no sense
because I love food.

491
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,480
And let me guess,
you don't remember that either?

492
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
No.

493
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,800
I am guessing
you also don't remember that.

494
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,800
I can't believe that
I flushed the Loom of Fate.

495
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Well, it's all right there
in the surveillance footage

496
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,480
Gideon apparently records
of our bathroom.

497
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,280
Well, clearly you're all
the culprits,

498
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,560
which, obviously, exonerates me.

499
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,920
No. Still no.

500
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,360
Yeah, this could all be mind control.

501
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,440
You think I'm behind it?

502
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
<i>Yeah.</i>

503
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,880
Who's there?

504
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,240
It's Papa Gare to the rescue.

505
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,600
Damn it, Gary,
what are you doing in here?

506
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,120
Oh, don't worry, I'm not gonna
let you out. I'm not a crazy person.

507
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,640
No, I'm serious. You cannot be
in here, it is not safe.

508
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,600
Well, neither is solitary
confinement.

509
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,000
Gary, what are...

510
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,320
- what?
- Which is why,

511
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,120
after careful consideration,
I decided...

512
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,600
you need my emotional support dog
more than I do.

513
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,880
I mean, I guess.
I guess it is kind of comforting.

514
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,480
Just promise me you'll treat him
like the little angel he is.

515
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,720
<i>- Kill him.</i>
- Wait.

516
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,120
Who, who said that?

517
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,160
Said what? Gary Junior, stop barking.

518
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,160
<i>Gary can't hear me.</i>

519
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,440
<i>Now, kill him.</i>

520
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,720
<i>Good girl. Now, kill them all.</i>

521
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,720
Which is why
after careful consideration,

522
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,760
I've decided you need
my emotional support dog more...

523
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
Wait, wait.

524
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,320
Oh, my God, it's the dog.

525
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,040
Your dog, your dog is a demon,

526
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,680
and it's gonna tell me
to kill everyone.

527
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,360
But you know what?
I am not gonna listen.

528
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,880
I'm not gonna listen, dog.

529
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,720
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't raise your voice.

530
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,360
Gary Junior's a very nervous pee-er.

531
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,480
Hey.

532
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,160
- Hey, where is everyone?
- Sara, Sara, Sara, hey, hey.

533
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,880
Oh, bollocks. How did you escape?

534
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,840
Hey, look, I figured it out.

535
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,160
It's Gary's dog.
He's gonna make me kill everyone.

536
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,520
Okay, babe, just calm down.

537
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,400
You told us not to listen
to anything you say. The dog?

538
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,560
Look, I know, but just listen.

539
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,720
I can prove to you that
I am telling the truth, all right?

540
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,160
I had a vision that I killed Gary,
and then, in real-time, I saved him.

541
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,040
And the fact that he is alive
right now proves that I am not lying.

542
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,320
You were right
to lock yourself up, love.

543
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,400
Listen, I know that I sound crazy,

544
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,320
but you just take me to that dog
and you will see that I am not.

545
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,160
Gary, where is Gary Junior?

546
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,640
No idea.

547
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,520
He ran off shortly
after she screamed at him.

548
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,440
What? I was saving your life.

549
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,920
- From who?
- From me!

550
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,440
Okay, enough.

551
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,560
John, stay with Sara.
Gary, let's go find the dog.

552
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,440
Yes. Teaming up like old times.

553
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,840
Gross. Can you wash
your hands first, please?

554
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Okay.

555
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
That's weird.

556
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,800
What the hell
is Gary Junior doing there?

557
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,000
Wait, go back to the other footage.

558
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,640
There. Zoom out.

559
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,920
Look, he's there every bloody time.

560
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,840
Junior, here, boy.

561
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,920
Where are you?

562
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,840
He's not ship-broken,
he doesn't come when called.

563
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,200
Where the hell did you get him?

564
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,920
I don't wanna say.

565
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,480
Gary, my girlfriend's gone crazy,

566
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,760
and I'm looking
for a dog to prove it.

567
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,320
I am beyond mad.

568
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
Fine.

569
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,200
I rescued him.

570
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,000
- From Hell.
- You adopted a Hell Hound?

571
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,440
Well, when you say it like that...

572
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,600
I saw him when we got Astra.
He was all alone, I felt bad for him.

573
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,840
Oh, my God.

574
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,600
Sara was right.
This dog is making us go crazy.

575
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,840
This is absurd.

576
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,640
This is more absurd than that
StabCast I did on the Son of Sam.

577
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,000
Wait, what does "Son of Sam" mean?
Because I...

578
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,160
I feel like Gary Junior
kept saying that to me in his barks.

579
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,080
What? No.
It was a guy in the '70s in New York.

580
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,280
He killed a bunch of people and later
said that a dog made him do it.

581
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,480
Oh, my God.

582
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,080
You adopted Son of Sam's demon dog.

583
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,120
Oh, my God.

584
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,160
At least I didn't buy from a breeder.

585
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,480
Whatever he says,
don't listen to him.

586
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,600
All I hear is annoying barking.

587
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,560
All I hear is
why I should murder you all.

588
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,640
And he's making
some very good points.

589
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,080
- Nate.
- Nate.

590
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,760
Nate, no.

591
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,400
Hey, hey, hey.

592
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,240
Was I trying to murder you
with the stool?

593
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

594
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,960
I am so sorry, guys.

595
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,040
- What the hell are you doing?
- It's a whistle only dogs can hear.

596
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,200
Why are you doing this to us?

597
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,720
<i>Because I hate hats.
I hate stupid ties.</i>

598
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,800
<i>And I hate Gary.</i>

599
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,480
- But I rescued you from Hell.
- From Hell?

600
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,720
Wait, are you working for my sisters?

601
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,000
<i>No, sweetheart.
I'm the Canine of Chaos.</i>

602
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
<i>I was gonna have you murder
each other,</i>

603
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,320
<i>but now, I'm gonna kill you myself.</i>

604
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,920
Get to the dais.

605
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,440
Don't let me out now.

606
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
Where'd he go?

607
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,360
What's that?

608
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,160
Yeah, it looks like
we owe you an apology, love.

609
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,720
Wait, that was Junior?

610
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,480
Let's just say Gary
has some explaining to do.

611
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,440
Come on, let's go stop
this bloody thing

612
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,880
before it kills someone.

613
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,080
Gary, your hand's on my...

614
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,640
- just move it.
- Sorry.

615
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,800
- Gary, that hurts.
- Sorry.

616
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,440
- Gary, your hand is still on my...
- No, I think that's me.

617
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,960
You can leave it
if you're comfortable.

618
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,840
-It's, it really doesn't bother me.
- Can I put my hand back?

619
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,600
- Man, shut up, Gary!
- No.

620
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,080
Why are you all acting like I brought
the Son of Sam's dog here on purpose?

621
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,640
- That's who that demon is?
- Yeah.

622
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,320
- Let me out. I will get rid of him.
- How?

623
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,560
- You still don't trust me, do you?
- No.

624
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,640
Ava, just let her out.

625
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,800
If we'd listened to her
in the first place,

626
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,200
we wouldn't be in this hot,
uncomfortable mess.

627
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,800
Hey, hey, hey.

628
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,680
Astra, I...

629
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,200
Yeah. Hey, I think you accidentally
put the force field back up.

630
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,960
I think she knows.

631
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,240
Oh, come on.
You gotta be kidding.

632
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,680
You really shouldn't mess
with someone

633
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,920
so comfortable with torture.

634
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,120
Lita.

635
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,720
Open the door.

636
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,240
Go away, Becky.

637
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,520
I know what it's like
to be mad at your parents.

638
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,960
I lit mine on fire.

639
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,720
But, let's talk about it.

640
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,360
We have nothing to talk about.

641
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,880
This is taking too damn long.

642
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,720
- We have to find that dog.
- Yeah, don't I know it?

643
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,040
And I could really use
another set of eyes. No offense.

644
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,880
Wait, wait, wait. What if we can use
my vision to search the ship?

645
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,080
- Yeah?
- Give me your hand.

646
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,040
Is it working?

647
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,600
- We have to get to the library.
- All right, come on.

648
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,320
Come on, open the door.

649
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
Lita.

650
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,960
Get away from her, you mangy mutt.

651
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,560
You idiot. I was born from fire.

652
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,280
- What did you do?
- I told it to attack me.

653
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,240
But at least,
I've got you to protect me.

654
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,760
John, I'm blind.

655
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,040
But you're not deaf.

656
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
Now what?

657
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,080
To send the demon to Hell,
I need to know its true name.

658
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,360
Well, I'm pretty sure
it's not Gary Junior.

659
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
His name is Marchosias.

660
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,760
Astra, you dick.

661
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,760
(Foreign language)

662
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,320
(Foreign language)

663
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,040
No!

664
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,640
All right, that should do it, Gideon.

665
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,840
We back online?

666
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,560
<i>I'm happy to report
all functions are restored.</i>

667
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,160
- You smell that?
- Oh, my God!

668
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,720
- What...
- Gideon, what is that smell?

669
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,600
Gideon, did something die
in your ventilation system?

670
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,400
No. It's me.

671
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,360
I had to scour every inch
of the waste disposal unit,

672
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,360
but I found the rings.

673
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,480
Jus, just hold on.

674
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
Thanks, Gary.

675
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,920
Yeah, getting the rings was tough,

676
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,600
but fair punishment for letting
a Hell Hound onto the ship.

677
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,080
It's all right. All is forgiven.
You were obviously mind-controlled.

678
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,800
I wasn't...

679
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,200
I just thought he was really cute.

680
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,640
- Of course, you did.
- Yeah.

681
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,680
Well, this has been
very traumatic for me,

682
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,240
so, once the Time Couriers
came back online, I...

683
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,640
got myself another
emotional support animal.

684
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,480
- You what? What?
- Oh, come on. Oh, come on.

685
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,600
- What is it?
- It's a wittle wabbit.

686
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,280
- Babe, it's actually really cute.
- What?

687
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,800
I've named him Gary Junior II.

688
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,280
Please tell me he's not from Hell,
though, because I'm gonna have to...

689
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,400
No, no, I wouldn't
make that mistake again.

690
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,600
- Okay.
- No, I got this wittle guy

691
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,520
from a mysterious carnie

692
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,080
who warned me never to feed
him past midnight.

693
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,680
Is one of those for me?

694
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,920
No. You're too young.

695
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,120
Oh, so, now you obey the law?

696
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Never.

697
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,200
You're my kid, my responsibility,
and I only want what's best for you.

698
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,120
I was a little harsh before.

699
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,800
It's okay. You saved my life.

700
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,000
It's, it's no excuse. Let me explain.

701
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,920
The life of a criminal
is a life of misery.

702
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,600
I've spent years in jail
thanks to some red leather freak

703
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,760
- so fast that I couldn't..."
- It's okay, it's okay. I get it.

704
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,960
You just don't want me
to suffer in the ways that you have.

705
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,280
Should I, stop reading?

706
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,080
We have a common interest,
and I thought we could bond over it.

707
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,760
But I understand why we shouldn't.

708
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,320
Right. I'll, take you home.

709
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,720
Why? I thought we were spending
the weekend together.

710
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,360
You wanna stay?

711
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,840
Yeah. Today wasn't so bad...

712
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,240
Dad.

713
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,480
- Roller derby tomorrow?
- No, absolutely not.

714
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,160
- The mall?
- Definitely no.

715
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,520
I see you're making
yourself comfortable.

716
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,720
You looking for John?

717
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,440
No. I am looking for you.

718
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,720
Why?

719
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,040
We're not friends.

720
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,360
I only saved your entire team
because it helped me.

721
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,040
And I only told Ava to let you out
because it helped us.

722
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,520
So, we're even. We're the same.

723
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,720
No, girl, you released Encores
onto the world

724
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,520
just to get your own way.

725
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,440
So we're not even.

726
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,880
We'll keep using each other
till it stops suiting us.

727
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,680
I am comfortable with that.

728
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,280
I'm not.

729
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,880
I don't know, let's see
if we can be more than that.

730
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,040
Come on, let me show you around
this weirdo ship.

731
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,120
I'm good.

732
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,800
Not planning on staying long.

733
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,960
But you get points for trying.

734
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,560
Okay.

735
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,600
So, I was thinking maybe later
we could try, try blindfolding you?

736
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,200
Stop reading my mind
or it's gonna get awesome?

737
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,200
Okay, let's just fix you up.

738
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,880
Come on, baby.

739
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,080
Okay, Gideon, do your thing.

740
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,200
<i>Scan complete.</i>

741
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,120
<i>I do not detect any abnormalities
in Captain Lance's ocular region.</i>

742
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,000
What do you mean, no abnormalities?

743
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,440
- Gideon, she's still blind.
- <i>I'm sorry,</i>

744
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,360
<i>but there's nothing I can do.</i>
