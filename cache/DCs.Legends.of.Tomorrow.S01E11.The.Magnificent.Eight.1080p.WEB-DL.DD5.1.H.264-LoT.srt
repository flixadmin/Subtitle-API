00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,837
- <i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant</i>
<i>named vandal savage</i>

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,539
<i>Conquered the world</i>
<i>and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:10,509
<i>I have assembled an elite team</i>
<i>to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,910
<i>And stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:14,480
<i>Unfortunately, my plan</i>
<i>is opposed by the body</i>

6
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:17,549
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,</i>
<i>the time masters.</i>

7
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,985
<i>In the future, my friends</i>
<i>may not be heroes,</i>

8
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:21,720
<i>But if we succeed,</i>

9
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:25,424
<i>They will be remembered</i>
<i>as legends.</i>

10
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,894
<i>- Previously</i>
<i>on "legends of tomorrow"...</i>

11
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,229
- Sorry we're late.

12
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:31,897
<i>- Aren't you even</i>
<i>a little bit happy</i>

13
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,265
To be back on the ship?

14
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,900
- I was happy with that life
we built together.

15
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:36,769
<i>- You think I was hunting you</i>
<i>and your friends</i>

16
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:38,871
<i>Because the time masters</i>
<i>made me?</i>

17
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:41,240
They barely had to ask.

18
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:42,608
<i>Since I failed</i>
<i>to bring you in,</i>

19
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,676
<i>The time masters want</i>
<i>to bring me in.</i>

20
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,578
<i>They're called the hunters,</i>
<i>and they'll stop at nothing</i>

21
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,415
Till every single one of us is
erased from the face of history.

22
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:52,151
- Do you have any suggestions?
- Run.

23
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:57,156
[ship engines roar]

24
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:04,396
- Aah! It's been quite a while
since I time-jumped

25
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,598
Far enough to experience
side effects.

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,067
Fond memories.

27
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,369
- I can't feel my face.
- Fine feel I.

28
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:13,906
- Linguistic dysplasia,
that should pass shortly.

29
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,374
- Better it now.

30
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:18,177
- Am I the only one who can't
feel their face?

31
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:20,913
- I can't feel my--
I better not say.

32
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:23,248
- Mr. Rory appears unaffected.

33
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,484
- What's going on?
We time-jump?

34
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,519
- Yeah, we time-jumped.

35
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:29,755
But "where to?"
is the better question.

36
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:34,426
- The town of salvation,
the dakota territory, 1871.

37
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,962
- I can't believe it--
the old west.

38
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,498
- This isn't going to work.
- It'll buy us time.

39
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,333
We can hide out here
while the hunters search

40
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:42,668
The other fragmentations.

41
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,037
- What if they decide
to check this place first?

42
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,807
- You know, feel free to loop us
in whenever it's convenient.

43
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,510
- As you've seen, time doesn't
operate as is generally thought.

44
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,579
It wants to happen.
It takes time to harden.

45
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:57,015
The--the timeline is unclear
on occasion,

46
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,350
Constantly in flux.

47
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,852
- Hence the difficulty
in locating savage

48
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:01,153
Throughout history.

49
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:02,955
- Indeed. And one of the other
interesting notions

50
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:05,524
Of time travel is the existence
of fragmentations.

51
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,793
- Temporal blind spots,

52
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:11,029
Specific places and times
the time masters can't see.

53
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:13,298
- The town of salvation
and its surrounding environs

54
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,667
Are located within one
of these fragmentations.

55
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,403
- So, basically,
we're hiding out in the old west

56
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:22,107
And hoping your boogeymen
don't find us here.

57
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,243
- The hunters
are not boogeymen.

58
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:26,311
And you better hope
they don't find us.

59
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,013
- Well, at least not until
I get a chance

60
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:31,817
To "punch a few doggies"
or "bust a bronco" or two.

61
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,720
Not that I condone
animal cruelty.

62
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:36,655
It's just that I watched a lot
of westerns as a kid.

63
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,092
- Alas, you'll have to enjoy
the old west from in here,

64
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:41,193
I'm afraid.

65
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:42,628
- Oh, come on.

66
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,964
What's the harm
in us just taking a look around?

67
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,432
- With this group?

68
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,201
Clearly, you haven't been
paying attention.

69
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:52,104
- Ugh, if I'm in the old west
and I don't get to look around,

70
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,472
I'm going to kick myself.

71
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:56,008
- I could help with that.

72
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,277
- I'll keep an eye on them.
Don't worry.

73
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:00,012
I'll be a good boy.

74
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,351
[lasers squeal]

75
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,954
- [chuckles]
I look just like wyatt earp.

76
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,157
- Now, the fabricator
can make clothing,

77
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,660
But you're also going to need
era-appropriate protection.

78
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,862
This era can get
a little, uh, rough.

79
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,665
- Oh, six shooters?
- Actually, most guns

80
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,500
Of that time period
had hammer blocks,

81
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:22,834
Thus reducing the number
of shots to five.

82
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,536
- Now, this should go
without saying,

83
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,905
But considering this group,
I am going to say it--

84
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:27,906
Only use these weapons

85
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:32,144
In the case
of extreme emergencies.

86
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:34,379
- You make it sound
like you're not coming with.

87
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,648
- From your duster and revolver,
I'd imagined you

88
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,084
As much an old west aficionado
as dr. Palmer.

89
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,920
- Indeed I am. But my time
is best spent back here

90
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:44,890
On the ship, plotting our next
move against vandal savage.

91
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,459
Besides, as mr. Rory says,
it's only a matter of time

92
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:48,994
Before the hunters
find us here.

93
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,763
- Don't worry. We're not
going to put down roots.

94
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,665
- Yeah, we'll stay
out of trouble.

95
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:57,336
- Mm, how I hope and pray
that to be true.

I like that.

124
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,995
- I've been on more than a few
dates with guys who thought

125
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,964
We'd get wasted
and they'd get lucky,

126
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:10,702

you played cards.

Aha.

Thank you, gentlemen.
- I'm impressed.

136
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,996
- My father was
what some might call

137
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:41,400
A degenerate gambler,
others would say criminal.

138
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:44,236
When I was old enough, he'd pull
me in on some of his schemes.

139
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,604
I picked up a thing or two

140

At a few of the card tables
he frequented.

141
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,409
Then I took

A different path.

Like father, like son isn't

Mister...

180
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,456

Jonah hex.

From out of town.

186

All right.

Why don't you folks tell me
where you're really from?

189

- I'm not sure that's
any of your business, sir.

190
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,879
- Let me rephrase that.

191
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,049
Tell me when y'all from.

192

You seven stick out

we're not from around here.

194
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,223

the first time travelers

I've ever come across?

196
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,227

197
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,795

198
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:26,298
I got some words
that need saying.

199

200
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,703

203

That whenever we go
to a new timeline,

204
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:46,384

to pick up...

I didn't get to see it
last time around.

208
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,758
- Last time?

209
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,427
- A long story,
which we will not be telling.

210
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,662

211

- What are you
doing here, jonah?

212
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,533
- Collecting on a bounty,

213
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,268
Wetting my whistle,

214
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,204
When your friends here
got in a lot of trouble.

215
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:09,708
- We might've gotten into
a barroom brawl back in town.

216
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,776
- Well, that was
entirely predictable.

217
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,714
- One of them poured lead into a
member of the stillwater gang.

218
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,849
- Mr. Rory.
- Snart, actually.

219
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,684
- Oh, that was
gonna be my next guess.

220
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,419
- This guy tried
to kill grey.

221
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,021
Snart saved him.

222
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:26,424
- And brought this town a whole
lot of hell in the bargain.

223
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,461
Those boys you were trading
hands with in the saloon--

224
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,863
They're all members
of the stillwater gang.

225
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,932
- Why can't a gang ever be
a bunch of good guys?

226
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,634
- Jeb stillwater
and his friends

227
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:38,737
Been raiding this town
for the past three months.

228
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:41,973
Stealing, robbing, killing.

229
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,242
- Well, he'll have to go
through us.

230
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,778
- No, he won't.

231
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,480
No doubt your--
your little ruckus

232
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,115
Has already placed
the timeline at risk,

233
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,017
To say nothing of potentially
alerting the hunters

234
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,718
To our presence here.

235
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,788
- Sounds like someone's planning
on busting out of town again.

236
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,323
- Leaving already?

237
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,858
- No. No.

238
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,292

is being terrorized

239

And I aim to do something
about it.

241
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:06,297

00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,733
You getting all native on us,

243
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,869
- Look, we signed on
to this mission--

244
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,570
- To stop vandal savage.

245
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,105
- To be heroes.

246
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,608
And saving a town from
a marauding gang of criminals--

247
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,777
That is what heroes do.

248
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,578

258
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,532
- [sighs] back at the saloon,
I ran into a woman,

259
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,468
And she caused me to have
more memory flashes, so...

260
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,438
I think I might have known her
in one of my past lives.

261
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,140
And if so, she might be able
to help me find carter.

262
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,309

gonna run out there

263
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,377
And try and find her?

264
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,713

a real short list, string bean.

so important to you?

- Because the past
is prologue.

It's not uncommon
for criminal posses

478
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:25,182
Such as mr. Stillwater's
to sack and pillage towns

479
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:27,752
Which they find uncooperative.

480

- So stillwater's
done this before?

00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:34,859
- In the case of calvert,
it was quentin turnbull's doing.

482
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,260
But it was my fault.

483
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:39,196
I'd come to calvert on a mission
from the time masters.

Did you name your son
after hex?

487
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,106
- After my mission
was completed,

488
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:51,342
I felt unable to leave.

489
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:54,812
I'd grown so attached
to this era--

490
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,081
A victim of the same
time drift you experienced

491
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,549
In 1958.

492
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,284
- But obviously you left
at some point.

493
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:03,621
- Left? I had to
tear myself away

494
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:05,256
From the time period

495
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:09,293
For fear that I would never see
my then-future wife, miranda,

496
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:11,162
Ever again.

497
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:18,202
Turnbull attacked calvert
the very next day.

498
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,904

499
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:22,006
You can understand
why I must act.

500
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,407
- No, martin, I don't.

501
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:25,309
As I said before,
this is advanced medicine

502
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,610
Unsuitable to the period,

503
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,412
To say nothing
of what this boy's survival

504
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,047
Might do to the timeline.

505
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,582
- Be that as it may,

506
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,751
I refuse to live
with the regret

507
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:36,787
I see on your face right now.

508
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,661
- The information mr. Stein got
from the barkeep paid out.

509
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:45,896
I know where
the stillwater gang's holed up.

- I remembered you,
you wigged-out little girl.

525
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:33,711
If I'd wanted
to talk to you then,

526
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,012
I would have talked
to you then.

527
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:37,047
I ain't fixing
to talk to you now.

528
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,416
Now, get off of my land!

529
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,818
- Listen, we're not trying
to start any trouble.

530
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,654
- Do you want that pretty little
mouth of yours filled with lead?

531
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:46,223
- Your friend has
a colorful personality.

532
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:50,795
- I ain't got friends.
I keep to myself.

533
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,865
- She's right.

534
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:58,402
She wasn't my friend.

535
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:01,305
I was her.

536
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:10,080
- We sat for that picture
at the county fair, 1830.

537
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:12,349
He looked
like such a gentleman.

538
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:13,684
- What was his name?

539
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,085
- Hannibal.

540
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,654
Hannibal hawkes.

541
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,122
- And what happened?

542
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,224
- Was it savage?

543
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,028
- What is this?

544
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,796
It looks familiar.

545
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,699
- That was ours
in our first life.

548
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,072
- I remember.

549
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,874
- We crossed with savage
in jefferson city.

550
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:38,542
He had it with him.

551
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,711
We escaped with it
and our lives.

552
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:42,279
- Do you still have it?

553
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:44,415
- We lost it to bandits
about a year later.

554
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:47,051
We heard that the pinkertons
were after the same bandits,

555
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:48,452
But we just...

556
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:51,655
- Hey.
What is it?

557
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,757
- Objects present
at the moment of my--

558
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,593
Our first death

559
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:57,828
Can be used to kill savage.

560
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,463
So, if I can get my hands
on that bracelet, then--

561
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:02,766
- You're going to try
to kill savage with a bracelet?

562
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,803
You need to stop.

563
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:08,906
- Stop what?
- Fighting our destiny.

564
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:10,674
Ain't destiny
what brought you here?

565
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,244
- What part of destiny
is she fighting?

566
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:14,778
- All of it.

567
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,081
We get reborn.
We find hannibal--carter--

568
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,750
Then savage finds us,
and then we die.

569
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,052
That's--that's
the way it is.

570
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,255
It's the way
it's always gonna be.

571
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:25,556
- I don't believe that.

572
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,525
- Well, I have
a few more years on you.

573
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:29,026
You can't break the cycle.

574
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,995
That's why I live
out here, alone.

575
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:34,331
- For the rest of your life?

576
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,434
- Well, I guess I had
to figure that out the hard way.

577
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:41,539
I was still a young woman
when savage left me a widow.

578
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:44,808
Instead of waiting for him
to find me and kill me

579
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,478
So that I could love my hannibal
in the next life,

580
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,947
I tried to find love
in this one.

581
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:52,416
Talk about a curse.

582
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:54,685
- What happened?

583
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:57,288
- He was a good man,
but he wasn't a soul mate.

584
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,057
It was like fate was trying
to break us apart.

585
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,960
Eventually,
fate broke both our hearts.

586
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:05,329
So I made a promise
to myself

587
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:08,699
That I wasn't gonna do that
to a person again.

588
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:12,303
- I'm--
I'm sorry to hear that.

589
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:15,272
- No, I'm who's sorry...

590
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:18,075
To have to be the one
to let you know

591
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:21,211
That you're never going to be
able to love anyone else, ever.

592
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:24,848
How much do you know
about our previous lives?

593
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,284
I reckon not a lot because
you didn't recognize me,

594
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:30,054
So let me tell you
that we did love other men--

595
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:31,855
Loved them real and pure,

596
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:34,592
But it never ended well,
not ever.

597
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:37,928
Tragedy or heartbreak...

598
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,999
That's how it always ends
if the man's not carter.

599
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,707
- We could've used sara
on this roundup.

600
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:51,208
- A lady? You crazy?

601
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,510
- Just remember,
we're here to arrest stillwater,

602
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:54,778
Not kill him.

603
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,780
- He always this much
of a stick in the mud?

604
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,315
- Yes.

605
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,522
- How?
It's a miracle.

606
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:08,892
- Oh, it's--it's not a miracle,
I can assure you.

607
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:10,461
Uh, m-mrs. Neal--

608
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:11,662
- Sarah.

609
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:14,565
- Sarah...

When the illness is gone,

611
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,837
I need you to promise me
that you'll take what's left

612
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:22,373
Of the medicine and burn it,
vials and all.

00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:25,876
- Yes.
Yes, I shall do it.

00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,181
- Sarah...

616
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,549
I wish you well.

617
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:34,752

You have the right

We trade stillwater for

You set stillwater free.

you mean...

Go after stillwater with all
your gear from the future.

I don't know how that'll sit
with your captain, though.

- Mm, let's assume
it's a bad idea.

667
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:05,602
- So who's standing
in the middle of main street?

your cowboy fantasies.

671

Plus, I'm a decent shot...

673
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,313
At least I was

- I can't believe
you're encouraging this.

675
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,184
- You know it's the only way.

676
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:21,618
- Dr. Palmer's going to get
himself killed.

677
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,587
- I think you forfeited
your right to an opinion

678
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:26,023
When you refused to leave
the ship since we've been here.

679
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:27,624
- I had good reason.

680
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:28,892
- Because of calvert.

681
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:30,761
- Yes, but not in the way
you think.

682
00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:34,231
Leaving calvert,
leaving this...Era

683
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:36,800
Is one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do.

684
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:40,704
- And why is that, captain?

685
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:43,974
- A time master is trained to do
his work without interference,

686
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:46,977
Which means not helping people
or being a hero.

687
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:49,880
But as you've seen, dr. Palmer,
this era offers

688
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:51,715
Many opportunities for heroism.

689
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:54,718
I found it...

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,420

to leave.

I was a time master.

703
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:26,750

705
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,220

of this era's penchant

00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,788
For being rife
with opportunities

707
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,190

That's one of the things
that called to me,

709
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,427

I had to leave.

710
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:42,432
Because had I stayed...

711
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:45,369
I could no longer
have remained a time master.

712
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:53,977
But I'm no longer
a time master...

713
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,545
Which is why
I'll face stillwater.

714
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:57,547
- Wait. I said
that I would do it.

715
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,249
- And get yourself shot
and killed?

716
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,286
It's appreciated,
but I'd rather you stayed alive.

717
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:05,822
