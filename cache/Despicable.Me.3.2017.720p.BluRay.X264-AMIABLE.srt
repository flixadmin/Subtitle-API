1
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,360
Illuminat...

2
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:32,592
Illuminat...

3
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:33,685
Ah not.

4
00:00:33,982 --> 00:00:35,331
Illuminat...
Gracia.

5
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:36,608
Késako?

6
00:00:40,893 --> 00:00:42,546
Illumination!

7
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:57,752
The year was 1985,

8
00:00:57,754 --> 00:00:59,795
and the number one show on TV was...

9
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:01,795
<i>Evil Bratt!</i>

10
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:04,927
The show starred
young Balthazar Bratt

11
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:08,644
as a child prodigy
and criminal mastermind

12
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:11,194
bent on world domination.

13
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:12,807
<i>There he is! Get him!</i>

14
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:19,171
<i>I've been a bad boy!</i>

15
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,050
Bratt was the biggest
child actor of the 1980s,

16
00:01:22,262 --> 00:01:25,749
striking a chord with
audiences all over the world.

17
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:29,475
<i>There he is! Get him!</i>

18
00:01:29,477 --> 00:01:32,807
But it all came to an end
in Season 3, when...

19
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,938
<i>I've been a bad boy!</i>

20
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,265
The young star experienced,
<i>Boy?</i>

21
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:38,749
An unexpected growth spurt.
<i>Boy?</i>

22
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:41,002
The show was canceled.

23
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:42,658
Hollywood rejected him

24
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:45,785
and Bratt quickly plunged
into a downward spiral,

25
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:51,027
starting to actually believe he was
the character he played on TV.

26
00:01:51,197 --> 00:01:52,657
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

27
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:54,767
Leading us all to wonder,

28
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:56,592
where is he now?

29
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:04,684
You know what, Clive?

30
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:07,147
Playing a villain on TV was fun,

31
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:09,523
but being one in real life,

32
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:10,941
is even better.

33
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:12,356
Heist music!

34
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:13,711
<i>Here it comes.</i>

35
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:19,150
What Clive?
What are you doing?

36
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,024
How is that heist music?

37
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:22,474
<i>Sorry. My bad.</i>

38
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,400
Mommy!

39
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,823
Stop or I'll...

40
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,120
Sir, the ship has been boarded
by some kind of monster!

41
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,679
Wait! That's not a monster.

42
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,710
That's a man wearing shoulder pads!

43
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:18,498
There's only one supervillain

44
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,760
whose fashion sense is quite that dated.

45
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,720
Balthazar Bratt.

46
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,470
Blast it! The Dumont
Diamond is on that ship.

47
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,640
<i>I want every agent in the area
on the scene immediately!</i>

48
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,632
<i>We're already here.
Agents Grucy are closing fast.</i>

49
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,570
<i>Yes! Wait. What did you call us?</i>

50
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,048
<i>Grucy. You know, Gru and
Lucy mushed together. Try it.</i>

51
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:46,638
<i>I like it, but not a lot.</i>

52
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,950
<i>I don't like it.</i>

53
00:03:53,656 --> 00:03:55,416
Stop! On the ground!

54
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,690
Go, go, go, go!

55
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,777
Too late again, Gru!

56
00:04:47,048 --> 00:04:48,048
He's getting away!

57
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,199
<i>That's what he thinks.</i>

58
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,140
Go! Go! Go...

59
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,383
Go! Go!

60
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,256
Go! Go! Go!

61
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,624
I don't think we can make it, Gru!

62
00:05:06,798 --> 00:05:07,848
We can make it!

63
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:11,992
We can make it!

64
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,666
No, we can't!

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,320
Get ready!

66
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,027
Get ready for...

67
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:35,519
Hey. How you doing?

68
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,334
Are you ok?

69
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:40,600
Bellas.

70
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:43,060
You guys are so cute.

71
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,690
Go get him, Gru-Gru!

72
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,820
Hello, Gru.

73
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,700
How's your transition coming?

74
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,658
You know, from world's worst villain

75
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,410
to world's worst agent?

76
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,922
That's hilarious.
You should be on TV.

77
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,981
That's right. You were!

78
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,538
But then you got canceled!

79
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:03,204
What about that?

80
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:05,554
What? Girls!

81
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,050
Dance fight!

82
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,719
Alpha Team, the diamond is secure.

83
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:32,241
Come and pick up the package.

84
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,620
<i>Copy that.
Alpha Team in approach.</i>

85
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,250
Gru!

86
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,852
Did you actually think
I was unconscious?

87
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:46,210
It's called acting, hoser.

88
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,630
And clearly, I've still got it!

89
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:06,741
I've been a bad boy!

90
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,320
Freeze! Don't move!

91
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,720
Son of a Betamax!

92
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,178
Go, go! Get him!

93
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,056
He's getting away!

94
00:07:15,147 --> 00:07:16,527
This isn't over, Gru.

95
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,557
You hear me? This is not over.

96
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,616
Yeah? Well, I still have the diamond.

97
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:25,534
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

98
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,279
<i>Happy birthday to...</i>

99
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,090
<i>Happy birthday, dear Dan.</i>

100
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,310
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

101
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:42,807
Hey?

102
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:44,625
La Macumba?
Si.

103
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:45,329
Ta-da!

104
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,253
Ta-da la Macumba!

105
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,498
I can't believe,

106
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,444
Bratt got away again.

107
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,670
How is this possible? How?

108
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,484
And it's not just that he got away,

109
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:26,271
It is he's so smug about it.

110
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:29,450
I've been a bad boy!

111
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:31,368
Edna, hey!

112
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:33,320
Looking hot today.

113
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,398
Got... cats on you.

114
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,602
And it was so humiliating,

115
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:40,371
dangling there
in the bubble-gum Speedo.

116
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,290
And I didn't have time
to go to the gym this week,

117
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:45,843
and I had a big breakfast.

118
00:08:45,845 --> 00:08:48,001
And was feeling a little bloated.

119
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,770
You know what?
He's not even worth talking about.

120
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:56,550
I don't even want to waste
another breath about the guy.

121
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,550
And another thing!

122
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:00,412
Next time I see Bratt,

123
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,471
I will moonwalk
all over his stupid face!

124
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,554
Thank you all for coming
at such short notice.

125
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,320
It is with great sadness

126
00:09:14,322 --> 00:09:16,950
that I inform you that as of today,

127
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,711
I am retiring as head of the AVL.

128
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,830
No!

129
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:29,290
Your new leader is coming
directly from head office.

130
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,750
Effective immediately.

131
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,853
She is the very gifted,

132
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,283
very ambitious,

133
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:39,587
Miss Valerie da Vinci.

134
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:43,584
As I look out over all your faces,

135
00:09:43,586 --> 00:09:46,222
I am flooded with so many memories.

136
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:49,082
Boy! This is a snooze fest!

137
00:09:49,084 --> 00:09:50,929
Excuse me, this is my last...
Blah, blah, blah! We understand.

138
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:53,141
You're old, you're fat, you're done.

139
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,860
Let me breathe in.

140
00:09:57,487 --> 00:09:58,724
Broke a little sweat, there.

141
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,706
First order of business.

142
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:04,990
Which one of you losers is Agent Gru?

143
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:08,646
That would be me.

144
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:12,938
Although, I don't know
if I'd say loser, per se.

145
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,262
Kind of is...

146
00:10:17,511 --> 00:10:18,489
it's the girls!

147
00:10:18,537 --> 00:10:20,008
Not a good time.

148
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,032
Hey!

149
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,517
Yes, sir!

150
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,801
Ma'am?

151
00:10:24,803 --> 00:10:26,057
You're making me nervous.

152
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,060
How could you let Balthazar Bratt,

153
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:31,608
the AVL's most wanted villain,

154
00:10:31,638 --> 00:10:32,736
just get away?

155
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:35,117
That is the opposite
of what we do here!

156
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,442
Ok, ok.

157
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:39,314
Yes, maybe he got away.
Again.

158
00:10:39,444 --> 00:10:41,990
But he didn't get the diamond.

159
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,030
And I am this close to bringing him in.

160
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,593
This close.

161
00:10:48,253 --> 00:10:49,403
Interesting.

162
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:50,688
You're fired!

163
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:51,960
What?

164
00:10:51,962 --> 00:10:54,573
That's totally not fair.
Gru is a great agent!

165
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,272
You know what? If you fire him,

166
00:10:56,274 --> 00:10:58,600
you're gonna have to fire me,
sister-sister.

167
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,417
And do you really wanna do that?

168
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,816
Do ya?

169
00:11:02,377 --> 00:11:03,888
No, no, no!

170
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,685
Well, I guess she did.

171
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,610
Honey, you didn't have to do that.

172
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,282
I know how much you love your job.

173
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,851
Well, I love other things more.

174
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,713
You know, we're gonna
have to tell the girls.

175
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,262
Can you do it?

176
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,540
The whole mom thing
is still kind of new to me.

177
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:34,748
Sure.

178
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Hello?

179
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,519
Aloha!

180
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,704
This is unexpected.

181
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:11,180
Well, you never got
to go on a honeymoon, so...

182
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:12,450
We made you dinner!

183
00:12:12,452 --> 00:12:13,649
It's a luau!

184
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,485
We got pineapples
and coconuts and ukuleles!

185
00:12:32,858 --> 00:12:34,520
The soup of the day.

186
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,367
Madame and Monsieur.

187
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,480
The gummy bears were my idea.

188
00:12:43,982 --> 00:12:46,071
Looks too good to even eat.

189
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,584
Am I right?

190
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,259
But I made it for you.

191
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:56,100
Good soup!

192
00:12:56,102 --> 00:12:58,410
I love the combination...

193
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,420
of gummy bears,

194
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,750
and meat.

195
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,300
I'm gonna hold it in my mouth.

196
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,210
Because it's so good,
I don't wanna swallow it.

197
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,723
So, how was work?

198
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,872
Did you take that guy down?

199
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:16,231
Did anything explode?

200
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:18,456
Well, actually,

201
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,195
today, Lucy and I,

202
00:13:21,197 --> 00:13:23,521
were invited to not work,

203
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,480
at the AVL anymore.

204
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:27,921
No!

205
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,410
You got fired?

206
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,890
No! No, no, no, no, no, no.

207
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,200
Yes.

208
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,830
But don't worry.

209
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,442
I'm sure we'll get new jobs.
Real soon.

210
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,169
Even better ones.

211
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,760
What's better than being
super-cool secret agents?

212
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:50,911
I know! You could gamble online!

213
00:13:51,106 --> 00:13:52,760
That's what Katie's dad does.

214
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:56,013
Ok. We will definitely look into that.

215
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:57,640
That's a good suggestion.

216
00:13:58,013 --> 00:14:01,246
And let's not go over
to Katie's house anymore.

217
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,883
Guys! I don't think you heard me right.

218
00:14:10,938 --> 00:14:11,988
No, no, no, no, no.

219
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,848
This does not mean that we are
going back to being villains.

220
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:17,943
Pignoo flacomico.

221
00:14:17,954 --> 00:14:19,954
Ok, alright. I get it.

222
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,607
Look, I know it's been
a little tough lately.

223
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,107
Especially with Dr. Nefario,

224
00:14:25,176 --> 00:14:27,942
accidentally freezing
himself in carbonite.

225
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,348
But our life of crime is over!

226
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:36,590
Mel!

227
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:38,796
Mel, you're with me on this, right?

228
00:14:39,843 --> 00:14:40,726
Looka.

229
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:41,888
Bueno.

230
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:43,619
Pignoo.

231
00:14:44,728 --> 00:14:45,525
Bueno.

232
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,305
Pignoo.

233
00:14:48,578 --> 00:14:49,430
Bueno.

234
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,483
Pignoo.

235
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:54,125
Minions!

236
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,795
Po les Pignoo!

237
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:58,041
Pignoo! Pignoo! Pignoo! Pignoo!

238
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,072
Guys, listen to me!
Read my lips!

239
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:02,720
Lissa me lipo.

240
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:04,944
Pomodoro la comquit.

241
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,090
What? What?

242
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:11,840
What did I say?
It's not kumquit?

243
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,412
Ok.

244
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:15,742
Pomodoro la kumquat.

245
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:17,898
Didusay kumquat palano?

246
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:18,845
No les palano.

247
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:22,348
Don't take that tone with me!
We're not going back to villainy.

248
00:15:23,035 --> 00:15:23,793
No villainy?

249
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,840
Yes! And I don't want
to hear another word about it.

250
00:15:30,986 --> 00:15:33,635
Look, if you guys don't stop right now,

251
00:15:33,637 --> 00:15:35,512
there will be consequences.

252
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:37,617
Wat, vazy molo!

253
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:40,120
Hey! Don't say anything
you're going to regret.

254
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,531
Noo les famos, les quittas!

255
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,133
Ciao Belo.

256
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,130
What? You quit?

257
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,388
You're serious? Come on!

258
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:56,829
Putchy?
Dave! Jerry!

259
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:01,373
Great news, guys.
You have been promoted.

260
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:02,622
You're in charge now.

261
00:16:03,224 --> 00:16:04,630
Not bad.

262
00:16:06,596 --> 00:16:08,310
Viva! Solo!

263
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:09,371
Yipee!

264
00:16:09,373 --> 00:16:12,871
Rooba. Rooba. Rooba.
Rooba. Rooba. Rooba.

265
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:14,596
Jeesh!

266
00:16:34,748 --> 00:16:36,187
Monsieur Pompeux!

267
00:16:37,174 --> 00:16:39,596
To what do we owe the presence

268
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,350
of the world's foremost gem expert?

269
00:16:42,554 --> 00:16:44,554
The chief of police sent me.

270
00:16:44,688 --> 00:16:47,688
He was concerned that during
the recent heist attempt,

271
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,335
the Dumont Diamond was
replaced with a phony.

272
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,200
Olala!

273
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,949
You have been duped!

274
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:14,473
What? We have?

275
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,550
Yes.

276
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,050
By me!

277
00:17:21,149 --> 00:17:22,189
But, what is...

278
00:17:25,489 --> 00:17:26,792
Oh no! Help!

279
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,626
I've been a bad boy!

280
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,856
Or should I say...

281
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:53,034
Je suis un mauvais garçon!
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I'm a bad boy!</i></font>

282
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:32,479
Hey, Gru.

283
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,290
What you doing down here?

284
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,735
In the dark.

285
00:18:36,384 --> 00:18:37,224
Alone.

286
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,365
Nothing. Just thinking.

287
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,430
You ok?

288
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,140
Yes. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

289
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,073
It's just...

290
00:18:46,368 --> 00:18:48,933
I don't know. I guess I just feel like

291
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:51,496
a failure.

292
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:54,400
Like I don't have a purpose anymore.

293
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:57,520
Hey, mister, you are not a failure.

294
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,847
If only I could have nailed Bratt.

295
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,530
So many times, I almost had him.

296
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:07,443
But now I'll never get the chance,

297
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,715
because I have been kicked to the curb.

298
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,515
Gru, you've got to let this go.

299
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:12,998
It's time to look forward.

300
00:19:13,562 --> 00:19:15,427
Things will get better. I promise.

301
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:35,455
Colé Céré. Colé Céré.

302
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:37,516
Papilion lapavaka.

303
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:39,137
Papilion.
Excuse me.

304
00:19:39,796 --> 00:19:40,618
Pardon me.

305
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,653
Colé Céré.
Young people?

306
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:45,881
Would you tell me
how to get to this address?

307
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:49,904
Cé la casa des Minions.

308
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,267
I'm looking for a Mr. Gru.

309
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,208
Gru pignoo to bad.

310
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:57,099
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

311
00:19:57,101 --> 00:19:58,135
Ciao!

312
00:19:58,895 --> 00:19:59,739
To bad.

313
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,590
Idiots.

314
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,810
No! Kyle!

315
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,008
Stop! Kyle, let go!

316
00:20:18,424 --> 00:20:19,743
No! No!

317
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:21,230
You've got to be kidding me!

318
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,725
Lucy, did you se...

319
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:24,126
He helps you if you have nightmares.

320
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:26,648
And he's really good to snuggle with.

321
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,269
No, no, no. Agnes! Agnes!

322
00:20:28,271 --> 00:20:30,484
So take good care of him.

323
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,842
Thank you!

324
00:20:32,276 --> 00:20:34,486
Agnes, what are you doing? You...

325
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:36,868
You sold your unicorn?

326
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,833
Well, I just wanted to help,

327
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:40,433
since you don't have a job.

328
00:20:41,382 --> 00:20:43,343
I got two whole dollars for it.

329
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:47,987
Excuse me?

330
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:50,129
Sorry, buddy, the sale's over.

331
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:52,479
Yes, but this will only take a...
Hey!

332
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:54,521
Eyebrows, get off the lawn.

333
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:55,417
Yeah, but...

334
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:56,980
Hey, could you...

335
00:20:57,952 --> 00:20:58,940
of course.

336
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:01,480
Now, as I was saying, I...

337
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,767
Goodbye!

338
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:12,467
Listen, Agnes, you don't need to worry.

339
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:14,027
We're going to be fine.

340
00:21:14,127 --> 00:21:15,067
For real?

341
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
For real.

342
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,420
Now come on, let's pack this stuff up.

343
00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:20,610
Seriously?

344
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:22,878
Buddy, you're not getting the hint.

345
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,208
Excuse me, Mr. Gru,

346
00:21:25,838 --> 00:21:28,840
but I really must have a word with you.

347
00:21:29,231 --> 00:21:30,588
How do you know my name?

348
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,574
Allow me to introduce myself.

349
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:34,178
My name is Fritz.

350
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,314
Good puppy.

351
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:41,840
And I am inquiring on behalf
of your twin brother, Dru.

352
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,354
He needs your help.

353
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:45,416
What? Twin brother?

354
00:21:45,463 --> 00:21:46,449
Twin brother?

355
00:21:46,459 --> 00:21:47,366
Tin bruther?

356
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:48,386
Ja.

357
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:51,538
He would like to fly you
to Freedonia to meet him.

358
00:21:51,907 --> 00:21:54,790
Your father has recently
passed away,

359
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,536
and...

360
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:57,018
Ok, cuckoo.

361
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,849
I'm sorry, but my dad died,
when I was a baby,

362
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,580
and I don't have any brother.
You got the wrong guy.

363
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,618
Really?

364
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:04,954
Well, then,

365
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:07,940
how do you explain this?

366
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:16,890
Bellissimo!

367
00:22:19,746 --> 00:22:20,666
Hello, Gru.

368
00:22:20,668 --> 00:22:21,748
Hi, Mom.

369
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,650
It's important to keep active
in one's golden years.

370
00:22:27,483 --> 00:22:30,322
There you are, you cutie, you.

371
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:36,100
These are my diving instructors.

372
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Vincenzo und Paolo.

373
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,016
Ciao, boys.

374
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:44,683
So, what do you want?

375
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,926
Mom, do I have a twin brother?

376
00:22:49,074 --> 00:22:51,298
How did you find out?
Who told you?

377
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,630
Wait, what? It's true?

378
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,725
You never told me I had a brother!

379
00:22:54,835 --> 00:22:58,270
And you told me that Dad died of
disappointment when I was born.

380
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,906
Ja, ja...

381
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:01,817
That was the agreement.

382
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,001
Agreement?

383
00:23:03,003 --> 00:23:04,798
What are you talking about?

384
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,990
Shortly after you and
your brother were born,

385
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,063
your father and I divorced.

386
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,660
We each took one son
to raise on our own

387
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,120
and promised never
to see each other again.

388
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:22,953
Obviously,

389
00:23:23,954 --> 00:23:25,914
I got second pick.

390
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,421
I have a brother!

391
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,100
Hey, girls! How are things in Row B?

392
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:42,614
I put together some fun
activities for the trip!

393
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,810
Who is up for some gin rummy?

394
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,973
Yeah...

395
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,730
We're good.

396
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:51,494
Ok.

397
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,882
I'll just sit here and play solitaire.

398
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,423
I hope I win.

399
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,519
I wonder what Dru will be like.

400
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,426
Maybe we'll have the twin thing

401
00:24:01,428 --> 00:24:04,120
when you can read
each other's minds, no?

402
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,870
How cool would that be?

403
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:07,461
Super cool!

404
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,980
Freedonia! Freedonia! Freedonia!

405
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,150
Hi, piggy, piggy!

406
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,420
Look at that house!

407
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:36,389
It's like a castle!

408
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,990
I can't wait to meet my brother!

409
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,740
What's with all the pigs?

410
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,210
This is the family business.

411
00:24:45,332 --> 00:24:48,580
The largest pig farm in
the whole of Freedonia.

412
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:51,509
Ok, nice pig.

413
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,670
No! That's my private part!

414
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,472
This pig has issues!

415
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:01,966
Please, come in.

416
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,610
This is amazing!

417
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,778
It's like the Sistine Chapel!

418
00:25:17,053 --> 00:25:18,721
But with pigs.

419
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,200
My brother!

420
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,500
My brother!
My brother!

421
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,968
Gru!

422
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,259
Dru!

423
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:47,499
Brother! I am hugging you!

424
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:49,029
I'm so happy!

425
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,345
After all of these years,
finally I'm meeting you!

426
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:55,495
Yup. Alright. Good.

427
00:25:56,182 --> 00:25:57,659
Look at that.

428
00:25:57,709 --> 00:26:00,259
You must be the beautiful wife.

429
00:26:00,278 --> 00:26:01,721
Beautiful?

430
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,139
Stop it.

431
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:04,397
Sweet talker.

432
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:07,533
How is my brother finding a wife
like you when he is so bald?

433
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
I'm joking!

434
00:26:12,402 --> 00:26:15,210
These must be my nieces!

435
00:26:16,028 --> 00:26:16,911
You're Agnes!

436
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:19,307
You are small with big eyes.

437
00:26:19,762 --> 00:26:21,593
And it makes me wanna
put you into my pocket.

438
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:23,249
You can't do that!

439
00:26:23,392 --> 00:26:24,888
I'm too big.

440
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:30,094
Edith! I can tell that you are
a little mischievous.

441
00:26:30,096 --> 00:26:32,473
We're gonna have to make
a little trouble later.

442
00:26:32,996 --> 00:26:34,138
I already have!

443
00:26:36,176 --> 00:26:36,887
Please!

444
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,797
Why are you doing that?

445
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,332
Fist bump for mischievous behavior!

446
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,459
And Margo.

447
00:26:44,918 --> 00:26:46,695
You are so mature!

448
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:48,827
I'm guessing what you're 15?

449
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,553
15?

450
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:54,043
She's 12. She looks 12
and will always be 12.

451
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,464
So, Dru, this place is amazing!

452
00:26:57,466 --> 00:26:59,550
I mean, you just walk through
the doors and you're like...

453
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:03,864
it's nice, I guess, sure.

454
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:05,769
I'm not really into things.

455
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,230
This is so cool!
Look at that!

456
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,600
My gosh! He's even got a helicopter!

457
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,020
This is the best!

458
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,940
Yes, the best!

459
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,398
Alright, let's go home now.

460
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,560
Home? Why?

461
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:24,110
I don't know. This guy with
the mansion and the cars

462
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,978
and all of the hair,

463
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,831
with the silky smooth, luxurious hair.

464
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:31,289
I feel worse than I did before I came.

465
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,526
But, he's your brother, Gru.
Give this a chance.

466
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,960
I was thinking, while Gru and I

467
00:27:35,962 --> 00:27:37,886
catch up on some brother stuff,

468
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,686
you girls should go with Fritz.
He has a surprise for you!

469
00:27:40,688 --> 00:27:42,090
Yay! Awesome!

470
00:27:42,092 --> 00:27:43,302
I love surprises!

471
00:27:43,557 --> 00:27:45,517
This is perfect!
Mother-daughter bonding time.

472
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:46,361
Let's do it!

473
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,970
Bye! You boys have fun!

474
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,553
Whoopi!

475
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,226
<i>Now you can be as evil
as Balthazar Bratt</i>

476
00:27:58,268 --> 00:28:00,478
<i>with the Evil Bratt action figure.</i>

477
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,150
<i>Featuring music-activated
breakdance mode.</i>

478
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,578
<i>Also featuring bubblegum-launching
shoulder pads!</i>

479
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,905
<i>And the all-new Mega Diamond Laser!</i>

480
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,773
<i>No more math!</i>

481
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,359
<i>I've been a bad boy!</i>

482
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,088
<i>The Mega Diamond Laser does not
actually incinerate books.</i>

483
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:25,417
How could Hollywood cancel a show

484
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,863
that produced toys like this, Clive?

485
00:28:28,824 --> 00:28:31,136
Evil Bratt was a masterpiece!

486
00:28:31,323 --> 00:28:33,821
Does no one value true art anymore?

487
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,992
<i>It's a disgrace and a travesty, sir.</i>

488
00:28:36,101 --> 00:28:38,034
Well, now that I've got the diamond,

489
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:39,830
it's payback time.

490
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,718
It's too bad Gru,

491
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,691
won't be around to try and stop me.

492
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,324
Wait! No, it's not.
I hate that dweeb!

493
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,280
And you, Hollywood!

494
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,602
This time, I'm canceling you

495
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,632
and all the losers who rejected me!

496
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,840
Piggy, piggy!

497
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,492
So, how are things going
for you career-wise?

498
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,567
Great! So, so great!

499
00:29:09,136 --> 00:29:10,136
Crushing it.

500
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,019
Well, I've got something that I think

501
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:15,995
you will find very interesting.

502
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,060
Hold onto your face, brother.

503
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,464
Y-ah! Ya! Ya!

504
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:32,078
Y-ah!

505
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:43,183
Salami.

506
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:45,830
Hey, wonton ya Salami.

507
00:29:46,192 --> 00:29:47,254
Si. Si.

508
00:29:47,751 --> 00:29:48,727
Ya Salami.

509
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:52,007
Come on! Come on!

510
00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:56,496
What is all this?

511
00:29:56,810 --> 00:30:01,100
The pig farm was just a cover
for the real family business.

512
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:04,886
Hey.

513
00:30:04,924 --> 00:30:06,135
It's Gru with boobs.

514
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:11,291
Now, feast your eyes on.

515
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,781
Dad's lair!

516
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,370
Ta-da!

517
00:30:19,023 --> 00:30:19,586
Wait.

518
00:30:19,588 --> 00:30:22,322
So, our dad was a villain?

519
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:25,110
No, no, no, not just a villain.

520
00:30:25,112 --> 00:30:28,170
One of the greatest of all time!

521
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,565
He was known as the Bald Terror!

522
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,553
That's him?

523
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:36,130
Our dad?

524
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,955
He was so proud of you.

525
00:30:37,957 --> 00:30:39,601
And what a great villain you were.

526
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,340
He was?

527
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,993
But me,

528
00:30:43,484 --> 00:30:44,941
not so much.

529
00:30:45,337 --> 00:30:46,223
To Dad,

530
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,915
I was just a failure.

531
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,490
He never thought I had
what it took to be a villain.

532
00:30:54,107 --> 00:30:56,897
But now, you can help me
prove him wrong!

533
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,647
Brother,

534
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,167
teach me the art of villainy!

535
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,010
No.

536
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,199
No, no, no. I can't do that.

537
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,109
What? But it's our family tradition!

538
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:11,762
You can't say no to that!

539
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,760
Look, I'm sorry.

540
00:31:13,926 --> 00:31:16,936
I left that life behind me. End of story.

541
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,270
Ok. I understand.

542
00:31:22,362 --> 00:31:23,900
I wonder what this does.

543
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,207
Holy moley!

544
00:31:42,316 --> 00:31:44,467
Dad's villain wheels!

545
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,790
Pretty slick?

546
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:51,186
Hey, you wanna take her out
for a spin, just for some fun?

547
00:31:59,995 --> 00:32:00,844
Look out!

548
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,650
What a beautiful day!

549
00:32:06,889 --> 00:32:09,270
Zero to 400 in three seconds.

550
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:11,308
Able to withstand a nuclear blast.

551
00:32:11,426 --> 00:32:12,788
Armed to the teeth.

552
00:32:14,945 --> 00:32:17,322
Ok, that's pretty nice.

553
00:32:17,324 --> 00:32:19,284
And it's a hybrid. Look out!

554
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,191
Help me!

555
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,722
I am not enjoying this.

556
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,623
What is going on here?

557
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,595
Welcome to the annual
Freedonian Cheese Festival.

558
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,466
Go!

559
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,130
Look, look! Look at all the candies!

560
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,010
Lucy, can we get these? Please.

561
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,140
Ok, but only one each. I mean it.

562
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:25,082
Oh, man.

563
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,408
No, I don't.
Get as many as you want.

564
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,300
I don't care.

565
00:33:28,302 --> 00:33:29,932
Yeah!
Awesome!

566
00:33:30,995 --> 00:33:31,730
What?

567
00:33:31,766 --> 00:33:35,675
Well, it's ok to tell them no,
sometimes too, you know?

568
00:33:35,785 --> 00:33:37,110
Moms need to be tough.

569
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,315
Right, right. Tough. Good one.

570
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,620
I can totally do that.

571
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,740
You know, still figuring
out this mom thing.

572
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,830
Getting my sea legs, matey!

573
00:33:45,882 --> 00:33:47,382
It's a unicorn!

574
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,171
Can we go in there?

575
00:33:53,173 --> 00:33:54,800
Please, please, please, please!

576
00:33:58,652 --> 00:33:59,782
Sure! Yeah!

577
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:00,855
You know, but first let's...

578
00:34:02,105 --> 00:34:02,865
Look!

579
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,466
It's a traditional Freedonian dance.

580
00:34:05,468 --> 00:34:07,038
How amazing does that look?

581
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,600
♪ <i>Say, say, say cheese!</i> ♪

582
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,100
Cheese! I love this.

583
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,955
The little girls go and get the
cheese from the little boys.

584
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,400
That's adorable!

585
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:22,382
Look at that poor little guy.

586
00:34:22,384 --> 00:34:23,991
With his little boots.

587
00:34:24,623 --> 00:34:25,870
Nobody picked him.

588
00:34:26,855 --> 00:34:28,706
Margo, why don't you go up there?

589
00:34:28,957 --> 00:34:29,753
No way!

590
00:34:30,052 --> 00:34:30,617
Ok.

591
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,407
Wait a minute.

592
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,429
No!

593
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,188
Go take a bite of his cheese, young lady.

594
00:34:36,203 --> 00:34:38,260
Right now!
What?

595
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,300
I'm being tougher, you know?
Like you said.

596
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,810
No! I meant be tougher on them.

597
00:34:42,812 --> 00:34:43,726
Not me!

598
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:45,189
Come on, just do it.

599
00:34:45,191 --> 00:34:46,439
What's the worst that could happen?

600
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,640
Fine.

601
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,820
Hey, there. I'm Margo.

00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,016
Hello, Margo!

603
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,780
I am Niko.

604
00:35:03,956 --> 00:35:05,936
Would you like some of my cheese?

Did you see that, girls?
I laid down the...

610

Oh no! Where are they?

Agnes? Edith?

612

Hello.

613
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,270
Look! A unicorn horn!

614
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,363
My little brain is going to explode!

615
00:35:40,424 --> 00:35:41,990
Agnes, that's fake.

616
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,460
It's real, alright.

617
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:49,620
That horn came from the Crooked Forest.

618
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,423
The only place on earth,

619
00:35:51,786 --> 00:35:54,541
where unicorns still live.

620
00:36:01,311 --> 00:36:02,925
Laugh, laugh, all of you.

621
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:05,747
They all think I'm crazy.

622
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,424
But I'm telling you,

623
00:36:07,713 --> 00:36:09,250
I saw one once.

624
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,420
With my own eye.

625
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,940
Wait, wait, wait.
You saw a for-real live unicorn?

626
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,111
What did it look like?

627
00:36:16,431 --> 00:36:18,360
Did you pet it?
Did it smell like candy?

628
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,425
Was it fluffy?

629
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,360
It was so fluffy,

630
00:36:24,228 --> 00:36:26,030
I thought I was gonna die.

631
00:36:27,072 --> 00:36:29,042
Do you think maybe
I could find one, too?

632
00:36:29,806 --> 00:36:32,450
They say if a maiden pure of heart

633

goes into the Crooked Forest,

634
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,373
the unicorn will come,

635
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:38,172
and be hers.

636
00:36:38,811 --> 00:36:39,981
Forever.

00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,131

638
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:54,890
Goal!

639
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,911
Excuse me.

Unicorns are really real!

And I'm gonna find one!

646

Sorry. Went a little mama bear on ya.

647
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,874
You know, I heard a scream and...

648
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,652
Yeah, ok, have a good one.

649
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,750
Wait for me here.

650
00:37:24,087 --> 00:37:27,029
Stop that! You kicked me.

651
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,873
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

652
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,430
Did you just steal candies? Yes!

653
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,026
That's a lot of effort for two lollipops.

654
00:37:43,176 --> 00:37:44,348
No! The police!

655
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,760
What do we do? What do we do?

656
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,860
Come on! This is gonna be fun!

657

00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,741

Tell me about it.

to pee your pants.

670

I did!

671
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,401
You did!

672
00:39:06,355 --> 00:39:08,628
Mel, tofa.

673
00:39:11,084 --> 00:39:11,810
Hey Mel.

674
00:39:11,812 --> 00:39:13,847
Laba city, la papaya, noo la potato.

00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:15,201
Hey, Mel la potato?

676
00:39:16,419 --> 00:39:18,806
La pizza. Pala komay.
Noo les tofa. Pa payé.

677
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,040
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

678
00:39:25,246 --> 00:39:27,371
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

679
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,063
Hey! What are you doing?

680
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,550
Intruders! Intruders!

681
00:39:36,235 --> 00:39:37,360
Pizza! Pizza!

682
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,010
There they are! Stop!

683
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,390
Hey, you, don't move!

684
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,327
Halt!

685
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,723
Call for backup!

686
00:39:49,273 --> 00:39:50,438
Komay. Komay.

687
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,603
Les pula la carbonara.

688
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:55,490
Oula.

689
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,811
Happy too les mocha.
Do it, do it.

690
00:40:09,171 --> 00:40:11,265
No, No, no, no, no. No.

691
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:12,473
No, No, no, no.

Yeah!

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,380
Hey, you! Freeze! Don't move!

719
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,127
Hands in the air!

720
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:46,927
Face it, Gru. Villainy is in your blood.

721
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,878
You can't tell me you
don't miss the rush.

722
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,696
A little?

723
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,677
Maybe a little.

724
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,690
And now you've got
the chance to get back on top.

725
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,044
Get your mojo back.

726
00:41:58,129 --> 00:41:59,681
Become Gru again.

727
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,710
How awesome would that be?

728
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,811
Please, come on.

729
00:42:05,813 --> 00:42:07,540
Just one heist.

730
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:12,250
There's got to be something
out there, somewhere

731
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,000
that you still wanna steal.

732
00:42:18,655 --> 00:42:20,249
There is something.

733
00:42:20,502 --> 00:42:23,422
How about we steal

734
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,928
the largest diamond in the world?

735
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:29,360
Yes! I love it!

736
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,690
Thank you, brother!

737
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:34,294
Thank you from the bottoms
of my heart.

738
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,578
You know what?
We should do something to celebrate!

739
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,637
I've got the perfect idea.

740
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,250
Fritz, my good fellow, could you
get me another napkin, please?

741
00:42:50,586 --> 00:42:52,416
Yes. Of course, Miss Edith.

742
00:42:59,747 --> 00:43:00,997
Hey, where are Gru and Dru?

743
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,090
Here we are!

744
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,210
How's it going?

745
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,557
It's me! Gru.

746
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:10,419
And me, Dru.

747
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:15,020
I hug everybody whether
they like it or not.

748
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,610
Why are they pretending
to be each other?

749
00:43:19,757 --> 00:43:21,071
What's for dinner?

750
00:43:21,073 --> 00:43:22,887
I probably won't like it.

751
00:43:23,082 --> 00:43:25,214
I'm so grumpy all the time.

752
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:28,298
Hey. I laugh a lot.

753
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,291
And I'm kind of an idiot!

754
00:43:41,237 --> 00:43:42,380
I'm busting a gut!

755
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:45,930
Look at them! They had no idea!

756
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,970
Total burn.

757
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,220
Look, it's me, Gru!

758
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:51,707
And I'm Dru!

759
00:43:51,709 --> 00:43:53,191
We switched places!

760
00:43:54,303 --> 00:43:56,126
It's so nice to see you two
are getting along.

761
00:43:56,622 --> 00:43:59,020
We're getting...
Along perfectly.

762
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:01,585
Wait. Did we... Just finish...

763
00:44:01,601 --> 00:44:02,240
Each... Other's...

764
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,365
Sentences? Sentences?

765
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,200
That's delightful.
Not creepy at all.

766
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:08,863
And you're gonna stop now though, right?

767
00:44:08,932 --> 00:44:10,892
Sorry, it's a twin thing.

768
00:44:12,612 --> 00:44:13,513
So,

769
00:44:14,263 --> 00:44:15,877
what did you guys do today?

770
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,717
Nothing.

771
00:44:18,747 --> 00:44:19,827
Ok. What does it...

772
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:20,706
All done!

773
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:22,484
Pardon me!

774
00:44:22,486 --> 00:44:24,335
Out of the way! Good night, everybody!

775
00:44:24,337 --> 00:44:26,396
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Put the brakes on.

776
00:44:26,398 --> 00:44:27,256
What's the rush?

777
00:44:27,258 --> 00:44:29,928
I need to get to bed so I can
wake up and find a unicorn!

778
00:44:30,008 --> 00:44:31,088
Good night!

779
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,270
What was that about?

780
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,955
Agnes thinks she's gonna find a
real unicorn in the woods tomorrow.

781
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,150
She's totally freaking out.

782
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,594
I feel like someone's got
to tell her the truth.

783
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:43,860
Not it!

784
00:44:45,026 --> 00:44:47,583
Don't worry. Parenting 101.

785
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:48,367
I got this.

786
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:54,291
And please bless that
when I find the unicorn

787
00:44:54,293 --> 00:44:55,532
he'll want to come home with me,

788
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,138
and sleep in my room.

789
00:44:57,253 --> 00:44:59,497
And that I can ride him
to school every day.

790
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:03,385
And he'll use his magical powers
to help me do math.

791
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:04,787
Amen.

792
00:45:08,383 --> 00:45:09,191
Hi, Gru.

793
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,841
Hey. So...

794
00:45:12,305 --> 00:45:14,061
big day tomorrow.

795
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:17,050
Yeah, I'm finally gonna
get to see a unicorn.

796
00:45:17,052 --> 00:45:18,061
For reals.

797
00:45:18,978 --> 00:45:20,592
If I do, can I bring it home?

798
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:21,671
Please?

799
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,055
Yeah. Sure.

800
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,978
Tell you what, every unicorn you find,

801
00:45:27,049 --> 00:45:28,519
you can bring it home.

802
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,410
I'd better build a big pen, right?

803
00:45:32,574 --> 00:45:34,178
But, you know,

804
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,978
there is a chance that
you might not find one.

805
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,420
It might not be good
unicorn-finding weather.

806
00:45:49,724 --> 00:45:52,407
They're tricky to find them.

807
00:45:53,112 --> 00:45:53,903
And...

808
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,453
I don't know. Maybe ju...

809
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,081
Maybe...

810
00:45:58,919 --> 00:46:00,982
unicorns don't...

811
00:46:01,586 --> 00:46:03,159
really ex...

812
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:08,859
explore that part of the woods.

813
00:46:11,873 --> 00:46:14,012
But... But the man said,

814
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:16,985
a maiden could find one
if she was pure in heart.

815
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:19,345
And I'm pure in heart, right?

816
00:46:20,642 --> 00:46:22,022
The purest.

817
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:28,505
Can we stop talking now?

818
00:46:28,624 --> 00:46:29,960
I need to get to sleep.

819
00:46:30,276 --> 00:46:31,577
Good night, sweetie.

820
00:46:31,909 --> 00:46:33,086
Good night, Gru.

00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:36,357
Gru?

831
00:48:00,693 --> 00:48:01,771
La broka.

832
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,858
Buddies!
Googna pota.

833
00:48:28,062 --> 00:48:29,179
Roma allé Gru!
Si!

834
00:48:29,316 --> 00:48:31,114
Roma allé Gru!

835
00:48:33,957 --> 00:48:35,711
Gru! Gru!

<i>What's today's plan, boss?</i>

841
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:52,754
What's the plan?

842
00:48:53,334 --> 00:48:54,249
Silly robot.

843
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,530
I'll show you the plan!

844
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:58,740
Time to watch a very special
episode of Evil Bratt,

845
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,160
to see exactly what I'm gonna
do to stupid Tinseltown.

846
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,420
<i>This week on Evil Bratt.</i>

847
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,442
<i>It's a giant Evil Bratt robot!</i>

848
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,013
<i>Open fire!</i>

849
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,370
<i>I have him in my sights!</i>

850
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,791
<i>Nice try, coppers!</i>

851
00:49:20,027 --> 00:49:21,335
<i>Chew on this!</i>

852
00:49:24,292 --> 00:49:26,060
<i>He's shooting his super sticky,</i>

853
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,730
<i>self-inflating gum!</i>

854
00:49:28,772 --> 00:49:29,730
<i>Run!</i>

855
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:32,792
<i>Gum one, gum all!</i>

856
00:49:35,294 --> 00:49:36,610
Gum one, gum all.

857
00:49:36,754 --> 00:49:39,674
Seriously, how did this
show never win an Emmy?

858
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:46,480
<i>And now, it's your turn
to shine, my diamond!</i>

859
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:01,430
<i>Hey, Clive. I guess you
could say our plan was</i>

860
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:03,170
<i>out of this world!</i>

861
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,770
Now, that's entertainment!

862
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,230
Come on! Let's make it a reality!

863
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:19,530
<i>Here we are, in the dark
and creepy Crooked Forest</i>

864
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,620
<i>in search of the mythical unicorn.</i>

865
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,200
<i>For some reason.</i>

866
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:24,561
<i>And here she is!</i>

867
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,748
<i>The fearless unicorn hunter seeking...</i>

868
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,120
<i>Edith, stop it!</i>

869
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:30,354
You're gonna scare away the unicorn.

870
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,710
If, somehow, we actually
find a unicorn,

871
00:50:32,962 --> 00:50:34,529
I'm gonna film it and get rich.

872
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,250
Look over there!

873
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,102
This is it!

874
00:50:40,104 --> 00:50:41,484
This is where we're gonna see it.

875
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:45,060
Unicorns, here we come.

876
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,680
What's that for?

877
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,352
Bait! Duh.

878
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:49,770
Come on!

879
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:54,103
Now, all we have to do is wait.

880
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:00,300
Ok, this is Bratt's lair.

881
00:51:00,302 --> 00:51:01,568
It may not look like much,

882
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:03,149
but this place is armed with some of

883
00:51:03,151 --> 00:51:05,156
the most high-tech
weaponry known to man.

884
00:51:05,659 --> 00:51:07,329
It's considered impenetrable.

885
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,411
But a piece of cake for us,

886
00:51:09,413 --> 00:51:10,621
right, brother?

887
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:14,466
Yes. This is not like stealing lollipops.

888
00:51:19,568 --> 00:51:24,220
His security system can detect an
air assault, from any direction.

889
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,270
<i>Ouch! No! Ouch!</i>

890
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:31,600
<i>Please, stop! Ouch!</i>

891
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,919
So we'll have to approach low

892
00:51:34,921 --> 00:51:36,390
and close to the water.

893
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:37,558
Next.

894
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,740
Then there are these deadly spikes.

895
00:51:43,045 --> 00:51:44,423
<i>Geronimo!</i>

896
00:51:45,009 --> 00:51:48,450
Covered with enough poison
to blow your mind.

897
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,660
Literally.

898
00:51:52,297 --> 00:51:53,208
Good to know.

899
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:56,790
So here's the plan.
You're the getaway driver.

900
00:51:57,587 --> 00:51:59,099
So you'll wait in the boat...

901
00:51:59,101 --> 00:52:01,260
Wait, hold on! Wait in the boat?

902
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,179
But, I wanna be in on the actions!

903
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:09,390
Dru, the getaway driver is the
most crucial part of any plan.

904
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:11,797
Do you know how hard it is

905
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,100
doing nothing, touching nothing

906
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:17,150
when all of that adrenaline is
coursing through your veins

907
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:18,358
and you must wait?

908
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,280
Can I count on you?

909
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:21,570
Yeah.

910
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:23,650
I guess so.

911
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:27,215
So, I'll climb up to the cube
and enter here.

912
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:29,990
Then once I'm inside,
find the diamond.

913
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:32,571
I've underestimated Bratt before.

914
00:52:32,573 --> 00:52:34,121
It's not going to be easy.

915
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,330
I think we can handle it.

916
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,510
Dad's villain suits!
This will make us unstoppable!

917
00:52:43,643 --> 00:52:44,906
Ay, chihuahua!

918
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,365
I call the black one.

919
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:51,510
It's go time!

920
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:02,879
Hello.

921
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:04,360
Hi!

922
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:06,270
Hello, mother of Margo.

923
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:07,818
I am Niko.

924
00:53:07,858 --> 00:53:10,135
I present you with pig to confirm

925
00:53:10,137 --> 00:53:11,941
my engagement to your daughter.

926
00:53:14,511 --> 00:53:15,830
Hey, what now?

927
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:17,770
What's going on?
Remember little boots?

928
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:21,130
Hello, my schmoopsie poo.
Oh! Hey!

929
00:53:21,737 --> 00:53:23,448
He seems to think you're engaged.

930
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:26,456
What? We're not engaged.

931
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,776
Look Niko,

932
00:53:27,778 --> 00:53:29,859
you seem like a very nice boy,

933
00:53:29,861 --> 00:53:31,278
with a very nice pig.

934
00:53:32,123 --> 00:53:33,520
But you're not engaged.

935
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,350
Ok? It's not happening.

936
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,440
I understand.

937
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,336
Who was I kidding?

938
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,547
A dumpling like me with
a goddess like you.

939
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:45,362
But I promise,

940
00:53:45,729 --> 00:53:47,781
I will never forget you, Margo.

941
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:49,700
Never.

942
00:53:51,323 --> 00:53:53,910
I'm pretty sure I won't forget you either.

943
00:53:54,107 --> 00:53:55,617
Bye. Bye, Niko.

944
00:53:56,811 --> 00:53:57,954
That was crazy.

945
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:00,845
That was totally humiliating.

946
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:04,090
Taking a bite of that cheese was the
stupidest thing I've ever done.

947
00:54:04,406 --> 00:54:05,746
Why did I listen to you?

948
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,803
Right. But it's over now, so...

949
00:54:08,905 --> 00:54:10,474
Here we go. Niko...

950
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,100
You refuse my son's engagement pig?

951
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:15,966
What?

952
00:54:16,146 --> 00:54:18,904
May you and your daughter
die a slow death

953
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,520
and be buried with onions.

954
00:54:23,388 --> 00:54:24,768
Alright, lady, that's it!

955
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:25,938
Nobody...

956
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,994
Nobody curses my daughter!

957
00:54:29,168 --> 00:54:30,243
Ya got that?

958
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:32,285
Because if you mess with Margo,

959
00:54:32,287 --> 00:54:33,531
you mess with me!

960
00:54:33,533 --> 00:54:34,739
And I promise,

961
00:54:34,741 --> 00:54:37,736
you do not wanna mess with me.

962
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:40,188
Do you understand me?

963
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:41,290
Yes. Yes.

964
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:43,871
Good. Now get!

965
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,210
Bruce forvien.

966
00:54:45,212 --> 00:54:47,059
Topolo minazliva.

967
00:54:47,676 --> 00:54:49,293
Look, Margo I think we just need to...

968
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:54,687
Yes!

969
00:54:56,115 --> 00:54:57,170
I have to tell Gru!

970
00:55:13,718 --> 00:55:15,195
Can we go back now?

971
00:55:15,216 --> 00:55:16,368
Already?

972
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:18,137
Just a couple more hours.

973
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,950
We have to be home
before it gets dark.

974
00:55:21,336 --> 00:55:23,001
I don't understand.

975
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,787
I did exactly what the man said.

976
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,050
You mean that one-eyed scar-faced
man that everybody laughed at?

977
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,183
Yeah, it makes no sense.

978
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:32,588
Look Agnes,

979
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:33,673
maybe we're not...

980
00:55:45,558 --> 00:55:48,230
My whole life has been
building to this moment.

981
00:55:55,653 --> 00:55:57,142
It's a...
Unicorn!

982
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:01,064
I can't believe it!

983
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,392
I'm gonna name you Lucky!

984
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:07,431
Lucky, stop it!

985
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,604
Yeah, I'll let someone else
burst her bubble.

986
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:22,171
Look at us!
Two brothers pulling a heist!

987
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:24,940
And that diamond will make us
the richest,

988
00:56:24,942 --> 00:56:27,798
most powerful villains in the world!

989
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,131
Right, brother?

990
00:56:30,651 --> 00:56:33,070
Right. Yep, yeah.

991
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:38,410
Bravo! Bravissimo!

992
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,286
You're amazing! I'm so sorry.

993
00:56:40,288 --> 00:56:41,947
I'm so embarrassed.
I was very rude.

994
00:56:42,026 --> 00:56:43,824
And you were always such a gentleman.
You did it!

995
00:56:43,826 --> 00:56:45,748
You did it! You got our jobs back!

996
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,510
What? Yeah, right. Sure.

997
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:56,050
Look. We're here!

998
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,274
I'm going in. Take the wheel.

999
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,146
I still don't see why I can't go with you.

1000
00:57:08,148 --> 00:57:09,951
Hey, hey! We discussed this.

1001
00:57:09,953 --> 00:57:12,373
Now is not the time
to mess with the plan.

1002
00:57:12,705 --> 00:57:13,795
Fine.

1003
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,920
Hey, brother!

1004
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,840
What? I told you, you are
supposed to stay with the boat!

1005
00:57:32,217 --> 00:57:35,010
I didn't think you meant that literally.

1006
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:36,756
What other way could I have meant it?

1007
00:57:38,068 --> 00:57:40,550
Alright. Let's move.
Just follow my lead.

1008
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,450
Got it.

1009
00:57:46,276 --> 00:57:47,109
Help me!

1010
00:57:48,794 --> 00:57:50,401
No! The poison spikes!

1011
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:52,375
I'm gonna be impaled!

1012
00:57:55,778 --> 00:57:56,740
I'm ok.

1013
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,450
I miss the Minions.

1014
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:00,469
Come on!

1015
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:07,755
Coming.

1016
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:15,170
Coming.

1017
00:58:19,915 --> 00:58:20,915
Come on.

1018
00:58:27,193 --> 00:58:28,526
It's a scanning device.

1019
00:58:28,888 --> 00:58:30,308
Quick! Camouflage mode.

1020
00:58:31,347 --> 00:58:33,195
Freeze! And close your eyes!

1021
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:34,610
And cover your mouth!

1022
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:42,320
Ok, take my hand.

1023
00:59:07,241 --> 00:59:08,581
Follow me.

1024
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,670
Look out!

1025
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,463
You were right. I should
have stayed in the boat.

1026
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:43,815
My stomach feels all queasy.

1027
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:47,187
I should not have eaten that pot pie.

1028
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:50,334
Hey, hey, relax.

1029
00:59:50,782 --> 00:59:52,452
You're gonna be just fine.

1030
00:59:52,838 --> 00:59:54,088
I got your back.

1031
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,200
Come on. This way.

1032

Gru népala. Gru nékooga.

1033
01:00:06,464 --> 01:00:07,800
Go, go, go!

1034
01:00:08,206 --> 01:00:08,983
Peter, hey.

Hey buddies!

Buddies!

1044
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,665
Looks like it's right above us.

1045
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:37,135
Ok, what do I do?

1046
01:01:37,137 --> 01:01:38,435
Should I wait in the vent?

1047
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,880
No, come with me.

1048
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:54,586
Dru, get off the bed!

1049
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,425
Yes, I'd like to thank the Academy...

1050
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,898
I can help.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1051
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,221
What? I can do it.
Don't! Don't! Don't!

1052
01:02:03,312 --> 01:02:04,174
Why, yes.

1053
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:06,890
Yes, Molly Ringwald,
I will take you to the prom.

1054
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,826
What? Who? Where? What?
Who's there? Who is there?

1058
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:38,587
Stay close.

1060
01:02:43,499 --> 01:02:44,327
Dolls.

1061
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:46,847
Looks like Bratt was the only one

1062
01:02:46,849 --> 01:02:48,397
stupid enough to buy this junk.

1063
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:51,610
I used to have one of these!

1064
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,580
Hey! Come on.

1065
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:07,779
Alright.

1066
01:03:08,173 --> 01:03:09,323
We're getting close.

1067
01:03:10,008 --> 01:03:12,015
From now on,
every move must be made

1068

Focus!

1071
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:21,008
We're after the diamond,
not the bubblegum.

1072
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:22,456
Got it!

1073
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,628
Yum.

1074
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:29,475
This way!

1075
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:33,185
And now, to put this where it belongs.

1076
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:35,830
What...

1077
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:39,061
Look at it, Clive.
It's beautiful!

1078
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,751
Will you please shut up?
He's gonna spot us!

1079
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:53,510
Spit it out! Spit it out!

There's two of you now?

1084

Then this will be twice as much fun.

1085
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:11,190
Gru.

1086
01:04:16,948 --> 01:04:18,490
Give me back my diamond!

1087
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:20,040
Total lockdown!

1088
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,186
Go get them, Bratt Pack!

1089
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:33,528
They're gonna get us!
They're gonna get us!

1090
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,025
Run!

1091

No!

1092
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,190
What does that mean?

1093
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,780
Are we gonna die?
Are we gonna die?

1094
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:55,860
We're gonna die! Dru!

1095
01:05:05,584 --> 01:05:06,279
What?

1096
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:09,250
Hey, guys. Hold on!

1097
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:11,050

1098
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,818
Thank you for saving us.

1099
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:23,597
Look! We got the diamond
and we're going to...

1100
01:05:23,605 --> 01:05:26,494
Take it to the AVL
and get our jobs back.

1101
01:05:27,422 --> 01:05:28,063
Wait!

1102
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,730
What? That's amazing!

1103
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:31,938
And the best part is, you'll never...

1104
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:34,272
ever go behind my back,

1105
01:05:34,274 --> 01:05:36,023
ever again.

1106
01:05:36,837 --> 01:05:37,640
Right, honey bear?

1107
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,253
Yeah! Yeah, right.

1108
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:40,917
Lesson learned.

1109
01:05:54,714 --> 01:05:56,134
I'll get the girls and start packing.

1110
01:05:56,136 --> 01:05:57,258
And tell them the good news!

1111
01:05:57,509 --> 01:05:59,474
We're getting our jobs back. Yeah!

1112
01:05:59,507 --> 01:06:01,150
Yes! Yes! Go tell the girls.

1113
01:06:03,108 --> 01:06:03,617
Dru...

1114
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,302
No! No way!
We can't give the diamond back!

1115
01:06:06,304 --> 01:06:07,987
No. I have to.

1116
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:10,537
No, you don't!
Yes, I do.

1117
01:06:10,544 --> 01:06:11,926
Give it!
No!

1118
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:12,856
Give it!

1119
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:14,846
What is wrong with you?

1120
01:06:14,848 --> 01:06:16,081
What is wrong with you?

1121
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:17,190
You kicked me!

1122
01:06:17,192 --> 01:06:18,441
You... You lied to me!

1123
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:20,360
Hey, I would have told you the truth.

1124
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:23,240
But you're too much of
a wimp to handle it.

1125
01:06:23,478 --> 01:06:24,768
That's it. I'm out of here.

1126
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:27,957
You have no right to take that.
We stole it together.

1127
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,198
Together?

1128
01:06:29,988 --> 01:06:31,328
You got to be kidding me.

1129
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:33,460
You did nothing but screw
up the whole time.

1130
01:06:33,633 --> 01:06:35,051
I got this in spite of you.

1131
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:39,126
Yeah? At least I didn't
get fired from my job

1132
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:40,588
like a total loser.

1133
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,340
At least I had a job.

1134
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:44,430
What have you accomplished
that was so great?

1135
01:06:44,596 --> 01:06:47,110
I'll tell you what. Nothing!

1136
01:06:48,014 --> 01:06:50,854
No wonder Dad thought you
were such a failure.

1137
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:55,110
We are no longer brothers.

1138
01:06:55,236 --> 01:06:56,512
That's fine with me.

I found a unicorn!

1149
01:07:45,148 --> 01:07:46,698
My life is complete!

1150
01:07:49,704 --> 01:07:50,969
Honey, that's...

1151
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,947
That's not actually a unicorn.

1152
01:07:56,086 --> 01:07:59,232
But, but, he has one horn.

1153

I'm... I'm sorry, sweetie but...

1154
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:05,015
he's just a goat.

1155
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,491
Life is just like that sometimes.

1156
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:10,852
We're hoping for a unicorn,

1157
01:08:11,448 --> 01:08:12,951
and we get a goat.

1158
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,400
Well, you know what?

1159
01:08:17,682 --> 01:08:20,589
Lucky is the best goat

01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:22,872
Look at that face!

1161
01:08:22,895 --> 01:08:25,368
I just want to squeeze it.

1162
01:08:30,829 --> 01:08:31,845
I'll take this.

1163
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,927
You've been a bad boy, Gru.

1164
01:08:35,346 --> 01:08:36,894
Can you get the rest of the suitcases?

1165
01:08:37,262 --> 01:08:38,882
Come on, girls. Let's go!

1166
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:42,576
♪ <i>Let's get physical, physical.</i> ♪

1167
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:51,356
Change of plans, girls.

1168
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:53,637
Instead of going home...

1169
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:55,054
Eyebrows!

1170
01:08:56,504 --> 01:08:58,823
We're going to Hollywood!

1171
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:03,190
Now, that's what I call acting.

1172
01:09:04,361 --> 01:09:07,570
Let's go, Clive! We've got
a giant robot waiting!

1173
01:09:13,755 --> 01:09:14,620
Lucy?

1174
01:09:14,656 --> 01:09:15,720
Gru! Gru!

1175
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:18,042
Bratt! He took the girls!

1176
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:20,317
What? No!

1177
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:24,704
Dru! Dru!

1178
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:25,953
Go away!

1179
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,576
I don't wanna talk to you.

1180
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,680
Bratt has the girls!

1181
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,503
Listen, brother what...
About what I said.

1182
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,860
No, I'm the one...

1183
01:09:40,862 --> 01:09:42,202
But I should not have...

1184
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:44,347
I'm... I'm sorry.

1185
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:47,860
I'm so sorry, Gru.

1186
01:09:51,041 --> 01:09:51,870
Look out!

1187
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,080
What is that?

1188
01:09:54,589 --> 01:09:56,516
Mel le planeur!
Le pla...

1189
01:09:57,632 --> 01:09:59,111
Ola! Caramba!

1190
01:09:59,182 --> 01:10:00,706
Caramba!

1191
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:02,880
Mel?

1192
01:10:03,762 --> 01:10:04,479
Gru?

1193
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:07,721
Velachi comeback doc.

1194
01:10:09,503 --> 01:10:11,151
Gru! Wait up!

1195
01:10:11,713 --> 01:10:13,221
Gru!

1196
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,298
Hello, Hollywood!

1197
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:45,000
<i>I'm back and bigger than ever.</i>

1198
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:48,630
I'm scared!

1199
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,077
Thank you. Thank you so...

1200
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:56,350
No! No!

1201
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,430
No, you can't leave me here!

1202
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,850
I'm famous!

1203
01:11:01,153 --> 01:11:03,002
Clive, arm the canons.

1204
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:07,780
<i>Chew on this!</i>

1205
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,478
Hey, mullet head! Let us out!

1206
01:11:28,338 --> 01:11:29,562
Don't worry, girls.

1207
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:32,630
I've prepared a front row seat for you.

1208
01:11:49,057 --> 01:11:50,150
Agnes!

1209
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,660
<i>Once again, I win and Gru loses!</i>

1210
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:57,660
<i>Enjoy the show, girls.</i>

1211
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:06,667
What in the heck?

1212
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:09,205
I hope the girls are ok.

1213
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:12,340
Bratt! Bratt at nine o'clock...
No! Three o'clock!

1214
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:13,680
He's on the left!

1215
01:12:16,769 --> 01:12:18,462
No! I've seen this episode!

1216
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:21,520
He's going to bubblegum the whole
city and send it up into space!

1217
01:12:22,273 --> 01:12:23,164
Hurry!

1218
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,200
This is it! This is it!

1219
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,140
Lights! Camera!

1220
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:39,700
Laser!

1221
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:51,590
Yeah!

1222
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,720
Look!

1223
01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:01,367
I've got the girls.
You two, go take care of Bratt.

1224
01:13:01,388 --> 01:13:02,926
Wait! What are you doing?

1225
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,820
Look, you guys, it's Lucy!

1226
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:13,195
Lucy, over here! Help! Help us!

1227
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,780
Mama's coming, girls.

1228
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:16,945
Lucy! Lucy!
We're up here!

1229
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:19,053
Look at that laser go.

1230
01:13:19,074 --> 01:13:21,353
I love it when a plan comes together.

1231
01:13:22,370 --> 01:13:23,693
It's Gru!

1232
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:27,540
Get ready, Bratt.

1233
01:13:27,794 --> 01:13:30,336
You're about to be blasted back
to the '80s!

1234
01:13:43,408 --> 01:13:44,995
We got him!

1235
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:55,190
No!
Don't worry.

1236
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,950
There's more where that came from.

1237
01:13:57,305 --> 01:13:59,668
It'll take more than that to stop me.

1238
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:02,357
Bratt Pack, go get that barf bag.

1239
01:14:11,216 --> 01:14:12,500
Incoming!

1240
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:16,340
You little...

1241
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:19,050
Get away! Get out of there!

1242
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:25,337
Quick, jump!

1243
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:29,023
Bonus!

1244
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:30,651
Did you see that, Clive?

1245
01:14:30,736 --> 01:14:31,588
All gone.

1246
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:33,730
Buh-bye, Wonder Twins.

1247
01:14:53,137 --> 01:14:54,140
Olala!

1248
01:14:54,398 --> 01:14:55,957
Washi giant bubbles!

1249
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:04,157
Help!

1250
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:06,010
Hang on!

1251
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:15,881
Hang on, girls! I've got you!

1252
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,758
I can't! I'm slipping!

1253
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,530
No!

1254
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,462
Got ya!

1255
01:15:27,102 --> 01:15:28,262
Thank you, Lucy!

1256
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:30,400
Let's go! We're not safe yet.

1257
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:34,475
Minions!

1258
01:15:34,597 --> 01:15:36,128
Help papa oti lapatira.

1259
01:15:36,235 --> 01:15:37,586
Picky kaya la popote.

1260
01:15:37,628 --> 01:15:38,824
Yaka pati la popote.

1261
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:41,179
Popi la popote!

01:15:41,186 --> 01:15:43,662
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1263
01:15:43,898 --> 01:15:44,953
Pata cool.

1264
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:01,570
Look at what we have here.

1265
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:02,971
Sorry, Gru.

1266
01:16:03,242 --> 01:16:06,019
This is going to be a total burn!

1267
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:13,750
Oh no! No, no, no, no, no, no!

1268
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:21,171
I've been a bad boy!

1269
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:32,600
Nobody messes with my brother!

1270
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,160
What? What's happening? No!

1271
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:00,902
Dru!

1272
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:03,010
Hold on! I'm coming.

1273
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,936
You've ruined everything!

1274
01:17:10,299 --> 01:17:11,276
And now,

1275
01:17:11,278 --> 01:17:12,637
it's time to die.

1276
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:14,940
Any last words, Gru?

1277
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:16,877
You know what?

1278
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:19,201
I got two words for you.

1279
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:21,650
Dance fight.

1280
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:26,240
It is on like Donkey Kong.

1281
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:29,490
I am going to enjoy this.

1282
01:17:49,024 --> 01:17:49,901
Enough!

1283
01:17:50,968 --> 01:17:51,809
My turn!

1284
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,246
Game over!

1285
01:18:21,223 --> 01:18:24,072
Is this what you're looking for?

1286
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:25,260
No!

1287
01:18:35,533 --> 01:18:37,140
No!

1288
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:43,059
Curse you, Gru!

1289
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:45,056
Curse you!

1290
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:46,753
Leo! Par laba.

Chop panapick.

1293
01:18:54,490 --> 01:18:55,085
Dru?

1294
01:18:55,759 --> 01:18:56,504
Dru?

1295
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:58,637
Dru!

1296
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:06,108
Hey! We did it!

1297
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,920
Yes, we did, brother.

1298
01:19:09,550 --> 01:19:10,590
Gru!
Uncle Dru!

1299
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,680
Gru! Girls!

1300
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:27,221
Gru!

1301
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,563
Hey, Mel.

1302
01:19:28,807 --> 01:19:29,893
Welcome back.

1303
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:04,202
Love you, Mom.

1304
01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:10,226
I'm a mom.

1305
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:11,886
I'm a mom!

1306
01:20:15,455 --> 01:20:16,533
Coca!

1307
01:20:23,707 --> 01:20:24,543
Pignoo!

1308
01:20:25,184 --> 01:20:26,973
Pignoo lepata. Pignoo!

1309
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:29,129
Boys,

1310
01:20:29,312 --> 01:20:30,700
time for bed!

1311
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,340
We're back at work in the morning.

1312
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:34,470
I'm coming, sweetie.

1313
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:35,586
Good night, Lucy.

1314
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,790
See you tomorrow, brother.

1315
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:39,292
Hey, I'm back on the job.

1316
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:41,118
So no villainy tonight?

1317
01:20:41,562 --> 01:20:42,286
Got it?

1318
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:44,203
I make no promises.

1319
01:20:44,492 --> 01:20:45,466
Love you!

1320
01:20:46,379 --> 01:20:47,043
Right.

1321
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:48,860
I love you, too.

1322
01:20:52,284 --> 01:20:54,869
Alright, every...
Go! Go! Go to bed!

1323
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,790
Hey! Guys! Come on!

1324
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:20,640
What... What is happening?

1325
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:22,270
It's coming from outside!

1326
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:28,230
Hey! I thought we said no more villainy!

1327
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,480
Sorry, brother!

1328
