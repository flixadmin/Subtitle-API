1
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,040
Rachel, let me see!

2
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,960
- Can I see?
- Finders keepers.

3
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,920
- And I found it.
- In my garden.

4
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,840
Finders keepers!

5
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,440
Bruce?

6
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,680
Bruce?

7
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,600
Mom! Mr Alfred!

8
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,560
Did you have dream?

9
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,480
Nightmare.

10
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,680
Worse than this place?

11
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,560
They are going to fight you.

12
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,840
- Again?
- Until they kill you.

13
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,520
Can they kill me before breakfast?

14
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,120
You are in hell, little man.

15
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,360
And I am the devil.

16
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,400
You're not the devil...
you're practice.

17
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,240
Solitary!

18
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,600
- Why?
- For protection.

19
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,640
- I don't need protection.
- Protection for them!

20
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,960
Get in.

21
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,320
Are you so desperate
to fight criminals...

22
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,440
that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?

23
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,640
Actually, there were seven of them.

24
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,600
I counted six, Mr Wayne.

25
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,200
How do you know my name?

26
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,000
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

27
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,680
no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.

28
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,920
Who are you?

29
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,960
My name is merely Ducard,
but I speak for Ra's Al Ghul

30
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,320
a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.

31
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
A man who can offer you a path.

32
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,320
What makes you think I need a path?

33
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,440
Someone like you
is only here by choice.

34
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,000
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity

35
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,800
but whatever your
original intentions

36
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,640
you have become truly lost.

37
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,400
And what path can Ra's Al Ghul offer?

38
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,920
The path of a man who shares
his hatred of evil...

39
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,280
and wishes to serve true justice.

40
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,520
The path of the League of Shadows.

41
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,480
- You're vigilantes.
- No.

42
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,200
A vigilante is just a man
lost in the scramble...

43
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,400
for his own gratification.

44
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,800
He can be destroyed or locked up.

45
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,160
But if you make yourself
more than just a man

46
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,960
if you devote yourself to an ideal...

47
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,040
and if they can't stop you

48
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,680
then you become
something else entirely.

49
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,480
Which is?

50
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,600
A legend, Mr Wayne.

51
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,520
Tomorrow, you will be released.

52
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,600
If you are bored of brawling
with petty thieves...

53
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,040
and want to achieve something

54
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,760
there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the Eastern slopes.

55
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,360
Pick one of these flowers.

56
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,040
If you can carry it
to the top of the mountain

57
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,120
you may find what you were
looking for in the first place.

58
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,240
And what was I looking for?

59
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,520
Only you can know that.

60
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,640
You turn back. Sure thing,
you go back.

61
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,760
Ra's Al Ghul?

62
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,520
Wait.

63
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,400
[Urdu]

64
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,920
What are you seeking?

65
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,200
I seek...

66
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,120
the means to fight injustice.

67
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,320
To turn fear against those
who prey on the fearful.

68
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,840
[Urdu]

69
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,280
[Urdu]

70
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,240
[Urdu]

71
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,000
[Urdu]

72
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:43,880
To manipulate the fears in others,
you must first master your own.

73
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,560
Are you ready to begin?

74
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
I can barely stand.

75
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,400
Death does not wait
for you to be ready!

76
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,080
Death is not considerate or fair!

77
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,920
And make no mistake,
here, you'll face death.

78
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,560
Tiger.

79
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,480
Jujitsu.

80
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,160
Panther.

81
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,000
You're skilled,
but this is not a dance.

82
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,720
And you are afraid.

83
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,720
But not of me.

84
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,480
Tell us, Mr Wayne.

85
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,440
What do you fear?

86
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,200
Bruce?

87
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
It's okay.

88
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,760
You'll be okay.

89
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Will we be needing
an ambulance, Master Wayne?

90
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,160
No, I'll set the bone and
take him for an X-ray later.

91
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,840
Very good, Sir.

92
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,440
- I'm very sorry, Sir. I've told...
- Don't worry, he's fine.

93
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,640
Took quite a fall,
didn't we, Master Bruce?

94
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,000
And why do we fall, Bruce?

95
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,400
So, we can learn
to pick ourselves up.

96
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,920
Just a little fall.
It's just a small fracture.

97
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,640
The bats again?

98
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,320
You know why they
attacked you, don't you?

99
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,360
- They were afraid of you.
- Afraid of me?

100
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,720
All creatures feel fear.

101
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,040
- Even the scary ones?
- Especially the scary ones.

102
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,840
I've got something to show you.

103
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,680
You think your mother will like them?

104
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,160
Yeah.

105
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,280
You think it's time to get up?

106
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,280
- Maybe.
- No going back to bed.

107
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,680
Did you build this train, Dad?

108
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,320
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.

109
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,040
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.

110
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,080
So, we built a new, cheap public
transportation system...

111
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,480
to unite the city
and at the center...

112
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,400
Wayne Tower.

113
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,880
- Is that where you work?
- No, I work at the hospital.

114
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,920
I leave the running of our company
to much better men.

115
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,800
- Better?
- Well, more interested men.

116
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,800
Can we go?

117
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,360
Please.

118
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,840
Okay. Let's go.

119
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,360
- What's wrong, Bruce?
- No, it was me.

120
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,680
I just needed some fresh air.

121
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,520
A little bit of opera
goes a long way, right, Bruce?

122
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,680
Come on. Let's go.

123
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,120
Wallets, jewelry! Come on, fast!

124
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,400
- That's fine.
- Fast.

125
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,000
Take it easy.

126
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,040
Take it easy.

127
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,400
Here you go.

128
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,280
It's fine.

129
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,680
Now, just take it and go.

130
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,480
- I said, "Jewelry!"
- Hey...

131
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,600
Thomas!

132
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,920
Bruce.

133
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,840
It's okay.

134
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,160
Don't be afraid.

135
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,520
Is this your father's?

136
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,600
It's okay.

137
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,760
Come here.

138
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,000
There you go.

139
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,000
It's okay.

140
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,680
It's okay.

141
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,320
Gordon.

142
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,520
Hey.

143
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,720
Good news.

144
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,280
We got him, son.

145
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,000
You're in excellent hands.

146
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,960
We'll be watching the empire.

147
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,400
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.

148
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,560
I thought I might prepare
a little supper.

149
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,520
- Very well.
- Alfred?

150
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,440
- Yes, Master Bruce?
- It was my fault, Alfred.

151
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,200
- I made them leave the theater.
- No.

152
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,360
- If I hadn't gotten scared...
- It was nothing that you did.

153
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,840
It was him and him alone.
Do you understand?

154
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,040
I miss them, Alfred.
I miss them so much.

155
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,840
So do I, Master Bruce.

156
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,840
So do I.

157
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,560
And do you still feel responsible
for your parents' death?

158
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,800
My anger outweighs my guilt.

159
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,880
Come.

160
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,720
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.

161
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,400
I will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.

162
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,080
You know how to fight six men.

163
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,680
We can teach you how to
engage six hundred.

164
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,120
You know how to disappear.

165
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,800
We can teach you to become
truly invisible.

166
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,240
Invisible?

167
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,160
Avi!

168
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,280
The ninja understands
that invisibility...

169
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,160
is a matter of patience and agility.

170
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,080
Always mind your surroundings.

171
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,760
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

172
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,640
- As weapons?
- Or distractions.

173
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,560
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.

174
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,840
You must become more than just a
man in the mind of your opponent.

175
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,600
- Who is he?
- He was a farmer.

176
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,480
Then, he tried to take
his neighbor's land...

177
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,960
and became a murderer.
Now, he is a prisoner.

178
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,440
- What'll happen to him?
- Justice.

179
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,840
Crime cannot be tolerated.

180
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,040
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.

181
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,240
Your parents' death
was not your fault.

182
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,120
It was your father's.

183
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,520
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.

184
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,960
- The man had a gun.
- Would that stop you?

185
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,640
I've had training.

186
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,440
The training is nothing,
the will is everything!

187
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,080
The will to act.

188
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,120
Yield.

189
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,720
You haven't beaten me.

190
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,840
You've sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.

191
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,280
Rub your chest.

192
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,480
Your arms will
take care of themselves.

193
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
You are stronger than your father.

194
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,040
You didn't know my father.

195
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,240
But I know the rage that drives you.

196
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,720
That impossible anger
strangling the grief...

197
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,280
until the memory of
your loved one is just...

198
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,600
poison in your veins.

199
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,800
And one day, you catch
yourself wishing...

200
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,240
the person you loved
had never existed.

201
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,920
So, you'd be spared your pain.

202
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,360
I wasn't always here
in the mountains.

203
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,200
Once, I had a wife.

204
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,880
My great love.

205
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,640
She was taken from me.

206
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,720
Like you, I was forced to learn
there are those without decency...

207
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,280
who must be fought
without hesitation, without pity.

208
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,840
Your anger gives you great power.

209
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,120
But if you let it,
it will destroy you.

210
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,040
As it almost did me.

211
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,480
- What stopped it?
- Vengeance.

212
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,880
That's no help to me.

213
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,520
Why, Bruce? Why could you
not avenge your parents?

214
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,760
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, Sir, or...

215
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,440
can I persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?

216
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,080
I'm not heading back at all.

217
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,120
- You don't like it there?
- I like it fine.

218
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,360
They just don't feel the same way.

219
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,440
I've prepared the master bedroom.

220
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,000
No.

221
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,560
My room will be fine.

222
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,400
With all due respect, Sir,
Wayne Manor is your house.

223
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,320
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

224
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,816
- Your father is dead, Master Wayne.
- And this place is a mausoleum.

225
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,640
If I have my way, I'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.

226
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,680
This house, Master Wayne,
has sheltered...

227
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,920
six generations of your family.

228
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,920
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
It's not your family.

229
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,560
I give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...

230
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,440
for what was most precious to him
in the whole world.

231
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,840
Miss Dawes has offered to
drive you to the hearing.

232
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,400
She probably hopes to
talk you out of going.

233
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,760
Should I just bury the past
out there with my parents, Alfred?

234
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,840
I wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, Sir.

235
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,880
Just know that
there are those of us...

236
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,280
who care about what you do
with your future.

237
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,160
Haven't given up on me yet?

238
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,840
Never.

239
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,520
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.

240
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,680
Hasn't he noticed you're
tall enough to reach now?

241
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,200
Old habits die hard, I guess.

242
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,520
- Never used to stop us anyway.
- No, it didn't.

243
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,160
How's your mom?

244
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,760
She misses this place.

245
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,000
So do I.

246
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,880
Yeah.

247
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,480
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.

248
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,360
Now, there's only Alfred.

249
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
And you.

250
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,080
- I'm not staying, Rachel.
- You're just back for the hearing.

251
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,920
Bruce, I don't suppose
there's any way...

252
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,920
to convince you not to come.

253
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,160
Someone at this... proceeding
should stand for my parents.

254
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,280
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

255
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,120
What Chill did is unforgivable.

256
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,080
Then, why is your boss
letting him go?

257
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,280
In prison, he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone.

258
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,920
He learned things and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.

259
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,840
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

260
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,000
I cannot let that pass.

261
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,960
And I need you
to understand that, please.

262
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,960
Okay.

263
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,160
The depression hit working people
like Mr Chill hardest of all.

264
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,336
His crime was appalling, yes,
but it was motivated...

265
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,120
not by greed but by desperation.

266
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,040
Given the fourteen years
already served...

267
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,096
as well as his extraordinary level
of cooperation...

268
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,560
with one of this office's
most important investigations

269
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,240
we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.

270
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,480
Mr Chill?

271
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,960
Your Honor.

272
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,080
Not a day goes by that I don't wish
I could take back what I did.

273
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,480
Sure, I was desperate like
a lot of people back then, but...

274
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,360
that don't change what I did.

275
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,040
I gather there is a member of
the Wayne family here today.

276
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,000
Has he got anything to say?

277
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,400
- He's coming out the side!
- He's coming out the side, guys!

278
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,240
Joe! Hey, Joe! Falcone says hi.

279
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,320
Come on, Bruce.

280
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,200
We don't need to see this.

281
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,640
I do.

282
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,240
The D.A. couldn't understand
why Judge Faden insisted on...

283
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,600
making the hearing public.

284
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,920
Falcone paid him off
to get Chill out in the open.

285
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,480
Maybe I should be thanking them.

286
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,920
- You don't mean that.
- What if I do, Rachel?

287
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,040
My parents deserve justice.

288
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,920
You're not talking about justice,
you're talking about revenge.

289
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,840
- Sometimes, they're the same.
- No, they're never the same, Bruce.

290
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,160
Justice is about harmony.

291
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,600
Revenge is about you
making yourself feel better.

292
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,240
That's why we have
an impartial system.

293
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,320
Well, your system is broken.

294
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,080
You care about justice?

295
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,120
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.
This city is rotting.

296
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,040
They talk about the depression
as if it's history. It's not.

297
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,600
Things are worse than ever down
here.

298
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,320
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs

299
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,320
preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe Chills every day.

300
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,200
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce

301
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,040
but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.

302
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
You wanna thank him
for that, here you go.

303
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,040
We all know where to find him.

304
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,656
But as long as he keeps
the bad people rich...

305
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,600
and the good people scared,
no one'll touch him.

306
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,680
Good people like your parents,
who'll stand against injustice

307
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
they're gone.

308
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,360
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?

309
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,600
I'm not one of your
"good people", Rachel.

310
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,200
What do you mean?

311
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,480
All these years,
I wanted to kill him.

312
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,040
Now, I can't.

313
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,680
Your father would be ashamed of you.

314
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,600
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr Wayne.

315
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,680
No gun? I'm insulted.

316
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,080
You could've just sent
a thank-you note.

317
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,880
I didn't come here to thank you.

318
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,080
I came to show you that not everyone
in Gotham is afraid of you.

319
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,960
Only those who know me, kid.
Look around you.

320
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,240
You'll see two councilmen,
a union official

321
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,120
couple of off-duty cops and a judge.

322
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,080
Now, I wouldn't have
a second's hesitation...

323
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,656
at blowing your head off right here,
right now, in front of them.

324
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,720
Now, that's power you can't buy.

325
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,760
That's the power of fear.

326
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm not afraid of you.

327
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,080
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.

328
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,640
But you haven't thought it through.

329
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,920
You haven't thought about your lady
friend down in the D.A.'s office.

330
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,080
You haven't thought about
your old butler.

331
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,120
People from your world...

332
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,840
have so much to lose.

333
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,280
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot

334
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,280
you know about the ugly side
of life, but you don't.

335
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,360
You've never tasted desperate.

336
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,280
You're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.

337
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,576
You'd have to go a thousand miles...

338
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,976
to meet someone who didn't
know your name.

339
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,840
So, don't come down here
with your anger

340
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,960
trying to prove something
to yourself.

341
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,960
This is a world
you'll never understand...

342
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,760
and you always fear...

343
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,920
what you don't understand.

344
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,720
All right.

345
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,640
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
I'll give you that.

346
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,920
More than your old man anyway.

347
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,200
In the joint, Chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.

348
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,560
He said your father begged for mercy.

349
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,120
Begged.

350
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,960
Like a dog.

351
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,120
Should've tipped better.

352
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
- For what?
- Your jacket.

353
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,440
Okay.

354
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,720
Hey. Let me have it.
It's a nice coat.

355
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,680
Be careful who sees you with that.

356
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,600
- They're gonna come looking for me.
- Who?

357
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,160
Everyone.

358
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,320
It's a nice coat.

359
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,840
When you lived among the criminals,
did you start to pity them?

360
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,800
The first time I stole
so that I wouldn't starve...

361
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,400
- Yes?
- I lost many assumptions...

362
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,080
about the simple nature
of right and wrong.

363
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,800
And when I traveled, I learned
the fear before a crime...

364
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,680
and the thrill of success.

365
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,360
- [Mandarin]
- But I never became one of them.

366
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,240
[Mandarin]

367
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Fool, what the hell do I care
what your name is?

368
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,600
You're a criminal.

369
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,360
Tell that to the guy
who owned these.

370
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,800
You've traveled the world
to understand the criminal mind...

371
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,560
and conquer your fears.

372
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,440
But a criminal is not complicated.

373
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,040
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.

374
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,960
You fear your own power.

375
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,880
You fear your anger, the drive
to do great or terrible things.

376
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,160
Now, you must journey inwards.

377
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,560
You are ready.

378
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,480
Breathe.

379
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
Breathe.

380
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,040
Breathe in your fears.

381
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,000
Face them.

382
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,360
To conquer fear,
you must become fear.

383
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,080
You must bask in
the fear of other men.

384
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,040
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

385
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,560
You have to become
a terrible thought.

386
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,640
A wraith.

387
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,600
You have to become an idea!

388
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,840
Feel terror cloud your senses.

389
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,800
Feel its power to distort.

390
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,680
To control.

391
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,720
And know that this power
can be yours!

392
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,160
Embrace your worst fear.

393
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,960
Become one with the darkness.

394
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:42,680
Focus. Concentrate.
Master your senses.

395
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,160
You cannot leave any sign.

396
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,840
I haven't.

397
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,120
Impressive.

398
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,520
[Urdu]

399
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,520
[Urdu]

400
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,360
We have purged your fear.

401
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,800
You are ready to lead these men.

402
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,880
You are ready to become a member
of the League of Shadows.

403
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,680
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.

404
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,400
No.

405
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,400
I'm no executioner.

406
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,200
Your compassion is a weakness
your enemies will not share.

407
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,200
That's why it's so important.

408
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,520
It separates us from them.

409
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,840
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.

410
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,120
This man should be tried.

411
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,600
By whom?
Corrupt bureaucrats?

412
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,160
Criminals mock society's laws.
You know this better than most.

413
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,760
You cannot lead these men...

414
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,240
unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.

415
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,680
And where would I
be leading these men?

416
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,360
Gotham.

417
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,120
As Gotham's favored son,
you will be ideally placed...

418
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,840
to strike at the heart
of criminality.

419
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,800
- How?
- Gotham's time has come.

420
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,160
Like Constantinople or Rome before it

421
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,560
the city has become a breeding
ground for suffering and injustice.

422
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,000
It is beyond saving and
must be allowed to die.

423
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,480
This is the most important function
of the League of Shadows.

424
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,120
It is one we've performed
for centuries.

425
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:13,120
Gotham... must be destroyed.

426
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,200
You can't believe in this.

427
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,160
Ra's Al Ghul rescued us...

428
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,680
from the darkest corners
of our own hearts.

429
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,960
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.

430
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,560
I will go back to Gotham and
I will fight men like this

431
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,000
but I will not become an executioner.

432
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,720
Bruce, please, for your own sake,
there is no turning back.

433
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,880
- What are you doing?
- What's necessary, my friend.

434
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,760
God!

435
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,080
I will tell him you saved his life.

436
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,360
Master Wayne, you've been
gone a long time.

437
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,880
- Yes, I have.
- You look very fashionable.

438
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,480
Apart from the mud.

439
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,920
Are you coming back
to Gotham for long, Sir?

440
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,160
As long as it takes. I want to
show the people of Gotham...

441
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,240
their city doesn't belong to
the criminals and the corrupt.

442
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,160
In the depression, your father nearly
bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

443
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,480
combating poverty.

444
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,880
He believed that
his example could inspire...

445
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
the wealthy of Gotham
to save their city.

446
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,560
Did it?

447
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,120
In a way.

448
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action.

449
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,160
People need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy...

450
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,880
and I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

451
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,000
As a man, I'm flesh and blood.
I can be ignored, I can be destroyed.

452
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,400
But as a symbol...

453
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,880
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.

454
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,800
- I can be everlasting.
- What symbol?

455
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,280
Something elemental,
something terrifying.

456
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,640
I assume that, as you are
taking on the underworld

457
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,640
this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals?

458
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,120
You're thinking about Rachel?

459
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,000
Actually, Sir, I was
thinking of myself.

460
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,240
Have you told anyone I'm coming
back?

461
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,160
I just couldn't figure
the legal ramifications of...

462
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,600
bringing you back from the dead.

463
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,600
- Dead?
- You've been gone seven years.

464
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,080
You had me declared dead?

465
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,880
Actually, it was Mr Earle.
He's taken the company public.

466
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,040
He wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding.

467
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,960
Those shares are worth
quite a bit of money.

468
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,360
It's a good thing I left
everything to you then.

469
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,280
Quite so, Sir.

470
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,360
And you can borrow
the Rolls, if you like.

471
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,080
Just bring it back with a full tank.

472
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,600
In my opinion, Mr Zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others...

473
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,840
and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation.

474
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,600
Dr Crane!

475
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,880
Miss Dawes?

476
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,976
You really think a man who
butchers people for the mob...

477
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,160
doesn't belong in jail?

478
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,936
I would hardly have testified to that
otherwise, would I, Miss Dawes?

479
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,040
This is the third of
Carmine Falcone's thugs...

480
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,520
you've had declared insane
and moved into your asylum.

481
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,280
The work offered
by organized crime...

482
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,560
must have an attraction
to the insane.

483
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,080
Or the corrupt.

484
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,200
Mr Finch. I think you should
check with Miss Dawes here...

485
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,520
just what implications your office
has authorized her to make. If any.

486
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,680
- What are you doing, Rachel?
- What are you doing, Carl?

487
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,120
Looking out for you.

488
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,080
Falcone has half the city
bought and paid for. Drop it.

489
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,440
How can you say that?

490
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,440
Because much as I care
about getting Falcone

491
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,880
I care more about you.

492
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,480
That's sweet.

493
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,200
We've been through all that.

494
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,720
A blessed bat again, Sir.

495
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,760
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

496
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,920
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.

497
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,960
Hey, I scratch your back,
you scratch mine, Doc.

498
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,760
I'm bringing in the shipments.

499
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,080
We are paying you for that.

500
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,200
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favors.

501
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,760
I am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr Falcone.

502
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,640
But you know who I'm working for
and when he gets here...

503
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,760
He's coming to Gotham?

504
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,360
Yes, he is.

505
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,720
And when he gets here, he's not
going to want to hear...

506
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,440
that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs...

507
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,120
out of a little jail time.

508
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,840
Who's bothering you?

509
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,320
There's a girl at the D.A.'s office.

510
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,720
- We'll buy her off.
- Not this one.

511
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,720
Idealist?

512
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,040
Well, there's an answer to that too.

513
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,680
I don't want to know.

514
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,560
Yes, you do.

515
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,440
No, we are showing very healthy
growth in these sectors.

516
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,376
I don't think that Thomas Wayne
would have viewed...

517
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,400
heavy arms manufacture as a suitable
cornerstone for our business.

518
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,960
That's twenty years ago...
Fredericks.

519
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,920
I think after twenty years,
we can allow ourselves...

520
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,040
to stop thinking about what
Thomas Wayne would have done.

521
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,080
Good morning, Mr Earle's office?

522
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,600
Yes, he's confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening.

523
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,680
Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr Earle.

524
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,320
Name?

525
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,040
Bruce Wayne.

526
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,360
Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

527
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,440
But that is what we,
as responsible managers

528
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,840
are going to do.

529
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,720
Jessica?

530
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,800
Jessica? Where are you?

531
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,280
- Eye on the ball and...
- Why is no one...

532
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,760
answering the phone?

533
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,560
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr Earle.
I'm sure they'll call back.

534
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,640
Bruce?

535
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,240
You're supposed to be dead.

536
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,720
Sorry to disappoint.

537
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,520
I need you to take a look at this.

538
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,920
Have you seen him yet?

539
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,520
- Who?
- Wayne.

540
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,080
It's been all over
the news. He's back.

541
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,480
I'm sure you realize
I can't stop the big machine.

542
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,680
- Too many wheels turning.
- We're going public.

543
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,160
I understand.

544
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,840
And I'll be handsomely
rewarded for my shares.

545
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,800
I'm not looking to interfere.
I am looking for a job.

546
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,400
I just want to get to know
the company that my family built.

547
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,440
Any ideas where you would start?

548
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,920
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

549
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,680
Fox's department.

550
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,520
I'll let him know you're coming.

551
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,800
You look like him.
Your dad.

552
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,640
You're the only one left
of the Wayne family.

553
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,800
This is where you belong.

554
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,840
Welcome home.

555
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Environmental procedures,
defense projects, consumer products.

556
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,240
All prototypes. None in production
on any level whatsoever.

557
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,760
None?

558
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,880
What did they tell you
this place was?

559
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,560
They didn't tell me anything.

560
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,520
Earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here.

561
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,640
Dead end.

562
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,320
Place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble.

563
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,160
Come on.

564
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,880
- You were on the board?
- When your father ran things, yeah.

565
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,880
- You knew my father?
- Oh yeah.

566
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,640
Helped him build his train.

567
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,480
Here we are.

568
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,880
Kevlar utility harness.

569
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:26,720
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.
The 350-pound test monofilament.

570
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,480
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

571
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,840
Routed it right into Wayne Tower

572
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,600
along with the water
and power utilities.

573
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,640
Kind of made Wayne Tower
the unofficial center of Gotham City.

574
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,920
Of course, Earle let it
go to rot. Here we are.

575
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,520
Nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry.

576
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,440
Kevlar bi-weave, reinforced joints.

577
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,680
- Tear-resistant?
- This sucker will stop a knife.

578
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,000
- Bulletproof?
- Anything but a straight shot.

579
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,800
Why didn't they put it
into production?

580
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,760
Bean counters didn't think
a soldier's life...

581
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,400
was worth three hundred grand.

582
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,040
So, what's your interest
in it, Mr Wayne?

583
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,000
I want to borrow it.
For spelunking.

584
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,720
Spelunking?

585
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,680
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

586
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,720
You expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves?

587
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,800
Look, I'd rather Mr Earle
didn't know about me...

588
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,200
- borrowing...
- Mr Wayne.

589
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,920
The way I see it...
all this stuff is yours anyway.

590
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,720
Okay!
Give it a try.

591
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,560
Charming.

592
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,000
At least you'll have company.

593
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,720
This must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing.

594
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,416
In the Civil War,
your great-great-grandfather...

595
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,400
was involved in
the Underground Railroad

596
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,560
secretly transporting
freed slaves to the North...

597
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,600
and I suspect these caverns
came in handy.

598
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,400
Alfred! Come up here!

599
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,480
I can see everything all right
from down here, Sir

600
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,880
thank you very much!

601
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,400
We order the main part
of this cowl from Singapore.

602
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,920
Via a dummy corporation.

603
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,920
Indeed. And then, quite separately

604
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,320
we place an order
to a Chinese company for these.

605
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,120
- Put it together ourselves.
- Precisely.

606
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,240
They'll have to be large orders,
Sir, to avoid suspicion.

607
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,400
- How large?
- Say, 10,000.

608
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,840
- Well, at least we'll have spares.
- Yes.

609
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,960
Don't suppose you want a taste.

610
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,560
I just keep offering, thinking
maybe someday, you'll get wise.

611
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,880
There's nothing wise
in what you do, Flass.

612
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,280
Well, Jimbo, you don't take
the taste, makes us guys nervous.

613
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,680
I'm no rat.

614
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,520
In a town this bent,
who's there to rat to anyway?

615
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,240
Don't turn around.

616
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,760
You're a good cop.

617
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,760
One of the few.

618
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,080
- What do you want?
- Carmine Falcone...

619
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,440
brings in shipments
of drugs every week.

620
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,400
Nobody takes him down. Why?

621
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,640
He's paid up with the right people.

622
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,800
What will it take to bring him down?

623
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:41,560
Leverage on Judge Faden and a D.A.
brave enough to prosecute.

624
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,640
Rachel Dawes.

625
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,120
Who are you?

626
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,960
Watch for my sign.

627
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,920
You're just one man?

628
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,280
Now, we're two.

629
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,720
We?

630
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,240
Freeze!

631
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,400
The hell was that?

632
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,160
Just some nut.

633
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,720
Now, what is it today?
More spelunking?

634
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,760
No. Today's base-jumping.

635
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,280
Base-jumping?

636
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,040
- Is that like parachuting?
- Kind of.

637
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,360
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

638
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,080
You know, I got just the thing.

639
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,960
It's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?

640
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,760
Regularly flexible,
but put a current through it

641
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,720
molecules realign, it becomes rigid.

642
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,080
What kind of shapes
can you make?

643
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,880
It can be tailored
to fit any structure...

644
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,200
based on a rigid skeleton.

645
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,600
Too expensive for the Army?

646
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,416
Well, I don't think they ever
tried to market it...

647
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,200
to the billionaire spelunking,
base-jumping crowd.

648
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,160
- Look, Mr Fox.
- Yes, Sir?

649
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,560
- If you're uncomfortable...
- Mr Wayne

650
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,080
if you don't want to tell me
exactly what you're doing

651
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,880
when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

652
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,040
But don't think of me as an idiot.

653
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,360
Fair enough.

654
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,080
What's that?

655
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,880
The Tumbler?

656
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,640
You wouldn't be interested in that.

657
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,720
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

658
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,360
During combat, two of these
would jump over a river

659
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,880
towing cables.

660
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,400
Over here on the throttle,
shift that open and throttle up.

661
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,440
This will boost you into
a rampless jump... Not now!

662
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,080
Not now, Sir!

663
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,480
Afterburner disengaged.

664
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,240
We never could get
the damn bridge to work, but...

665
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,600
this baby works just fine.

666
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,800
So, what do you think?

667
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,640
Does it come in black?

668
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,680
I need you at the docks, Thursday.

669
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,840
Problems?

670
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,120
I don't want any trouble
with the last shipment.

671
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,520
Sure.

672
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,720
Word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the D.A.'s office.

673
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,520
- Is that right?
- And that there's a fat prize...

674
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,120
waiting for anybody
willing to do anything about it.

675
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,560
So, what's your point, Mr Flass?

676
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,120
Have you seen the girl?

677
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,440
It's a cute little assistant D.A.

678
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,520
Don't you think that's a little bit
too much heat to bring down, maybe?

679
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,880
- Even for this town.
- Never underestimate Gotham City.

680
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,640
People get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week.

681
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,800
Sometimes, things just go bad.

682
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,080
It's a problem with
the graphite, Sir.

683
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,520
The next 10000 will be
up to specifications.

684
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,280
At least they gave us a discount.

685
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,200
Quite. In the meantime, Sir,
may I suggest you try to...

686
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,360
avoid landing on your head?

687
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,440
Why bats, Master Wayne?

688
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,040
Bats frighten me...

689
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,120
and it's time my enemies
shared my dread.

690
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,160
What is this?

691
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,320
Continue.

692
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,400
Looks fine out there.

693
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,680
The bears go straight to the dealers?

694
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,520
Yeah, and the rabbits go to
the man in the Narrows.

695
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,600
- What's the difference?
- Ignorance is bliss, my friend.

696
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,200
Don't burden yourself with
these secrets of scary people.

697
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,960
Hey. Steiss?

698
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,560
Steiss?

699
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,480
What?

700
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,640
What the hell?

701
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,720
I better check it.

702
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,320
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.

703
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,680
Where are you?

704
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,320
Here.

705
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,560
Take a ride.

706
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,920
Shit.

707
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,720
What the hell are you?

708
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,080
I'm Batman.

709
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,200
Nice coat.

710
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,720
Thanks.

711
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,680
Hold it!

712
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,360
That's right, you better run.

713
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,360
Falcone sent them to kill you.

714
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,720
- Why?
- You rattled his cage.

715
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,800
- What's this?
- Leverage.

716
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,680
- For what?
- To get things moving.

717
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,240
Who are you?

718
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,840
Someone like you.
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

719
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,960
Ma'am? Is everything okay?

720
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,760
Falcone's men?

721
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,160
Does it matter?

722
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,040
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

723
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,440
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

724
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,640
What the hell is that?

725
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,680
Cut him down.

726
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,200
Unacceptable.

727
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,360
Now, I don't care if it's
rival gangs, guardian angels...

728
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,400
or the goddamn Salvation Army

729
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,840
get them off the street
and off the front page.

730
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,360
They say it was just one guy
or a creature.

731
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,440
It was some asshole
in a costume.

732
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,360
- Yeah?
- This guy did deliver us...

733
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,000
one of the city's
biggest crime lords.

734
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:33,600
No one takes the law into
their own hands in my city.

735
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,040
Understand?

736
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,656
- No way to bury it now.
- Maybe so, but...

737
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,536
- there's still Judge Faden.
- I've got Faden covered.

738
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,760
Okay, what about this bat
they're babbling about?

739
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,560
Even if these guys
will swear in court...

740
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,920
to being thrashed by a giant bat

741
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,040
we've got Falcone at the scene.

742
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,760
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests

743
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,520
this bat character
gave us everything.

744
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,480
Okay. Let's do it.

745
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,680
- Bats are nocturnal.
- Bats may be.

746
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,160
But even for billionaire playboys,
three o'clock is pushing it.

747
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,320
The price for leading
a double life, I fear.

748
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,680
Your theatrics made an impression.

749
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:13,480
Theatricality and deception
are powerful weapons, Alfred.

750
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,640
It's a good start.

751
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,720
If those are to be the first
of many injuries to come

752
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,720
it would be wise to find
a suitable excuse.

753
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,920
Polo, for instance.

754
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,880
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

755
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,400
Strange injuries,
a nonexistent social life

756
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,520
these things beg the question
as to what exactly...

757
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,360
does Bruce Wayne do with
his time and his money.

758
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,360
What does someone like me do?

759
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,720
Drive sports cars.

760
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,720
Date movie stars.

761
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,280
Buy things that are not for sale.

762
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,960
Who knows, Master Wayne,
you start pretending to have fun...

763
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,520
you might even have
a little by accident.

764
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:54,960
- Sir? We have a situation.
- All right.

765
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:58,960
The Coast Guard picked up one of
our cargo ships last night.

766
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:03,080
It's heavily damaged.
All crew missing, probably dead.

767
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,040
The ship was carrying
a prototype weapon.

768
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,480
It's a microwave emitter.

769
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:13,080
It's designed for
desert warfare, but it...

770
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,320
it looks like somebody...

771
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,240
turned it on.

772
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:30,440
It uses focused microwaves
to vaporize the enemy's water supply.

773
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,200
The damage to the ship
was catastrophic.

774
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,840
The weapon itself is...

775
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,920
Missing?

776
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,360
Yeah.

777
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,240
Nice car.

778
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,040
You should see my other one.

779
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,240
He's done something
the police have never done.

780
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,720
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

781
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,920
Well, at least he's getting
something done.

782
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,000
Bruce, help me out here.

783
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:21,240
Well, a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues.

784
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,080
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

785
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,616
And now, the cops wanna bring him
in, so what does that tell you?

786
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:27,800
They're jealous.

787
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:33,720
Sir, the pool is for decoration and
your friends do not have swimwear.

788
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,840
Well, they're European.

789
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,920
I'm going to have to
ask you to leave.

790
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,560
- It is not a question of money.
- Well, you see

791
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:49,440
I'm buying this hotel and...

792
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,600
setting some new rules
about the pool area.

793
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,520
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

794
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,880
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

795
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,200
Thank you.

796
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,440
Bruce?

797
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,120
Rachel?

798
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,360
I had heard you were back.

799
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,120
What are you doing?

800
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:25,560
Just swimming here.
It is good to see you.

801
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,320
You were gone a long time.

802
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,720
- I know. How are things?
- The same.

803
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,640
The job's getting worse.

804
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,400
Can't change the world on your own.

805
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,360
What choice do I have...

806
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,360
when you're too busy swimming?

807
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:46,080
Rachel, all of... all this

808
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:51,280
it's not me. It's...

809
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:57,120
Inside, I am... I am more.

810
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,480
Come on, Bruce. Come on!

811
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:02,920
Bruce, we have some more hotels
for you to buy.

812
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,640
Bruce.

813
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:10,480
Deep down, you may still be
that same great kid you used to be.

814
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:17,400
But it's not who you are underneath,
it's what you do that defines you.

815
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:32,240
- Dr Crane, thanks for coming.
- Not at all.

816
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,760
He cut his wrists?

817
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,920
Probably looking for
the insanity plea

818
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,320
but if anything should happen...

819
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,960
Of course, better safe than sorry.

820
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,960
Yeah, Dr Crane, I can't take it
anymore. It's all too much.

821
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,800
The walls are closing in,
blah, blah, blah.

822
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,800
A couple days of this food,
it'll be true.

823
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:54,320
What do you want?

824
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,520
I wanna know how you're gonna
convince me to keep my mouth shut.

825
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,840
About what? You don't know
anything.

826
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,200
I know you don't want the cops
to take a closer look...

827
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,720
at the drugs they seized.

828
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:08,040
And I know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nuthouse.

829
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,776
See, I don't go into
business with a guy...

830
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,040
without finding out
his dirty secrets.

831
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:15,080
And those goons you used.

832
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,000
I own the muscle in this town.

833
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:20,800
Now, I've been bringing
your stuff in for months

834
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,280
so whatever he's planning,
it's big and I want in.

835
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,840
Well, I already know what he'll say.

836
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,280
That we should kill you.

837
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:36,200
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.

838
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,440
Would you like to see my mask?

839
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,360
I use it in my experiments.

840
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:53,040
Now, I'm probably not very
frightening to a guy like you.

841
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,880
But these crazies,
they can't stand it.

842
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,880
So, when did the nut
take over the nuthouse?

843
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:04,720
They scream and they cry,
much as you're doing now.

844
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,720
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

845
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,360
I'll talk to the Judge and see
if I can get him moved...

846
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,680
to the secure wing at Arkham.
I can't treat him here.

847
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,600
Storm's coming.

848
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:45,800
The scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to Falcone.

849
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,120
It's a start. Your partner
was at the docks with Falcone.

850
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,040
Well, he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer.

851
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:54,120
They were splitting
the shipment in two.

852
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,160
Only half went to the dealers.

853
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,040
Why? What about the other half?

854
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,880
- Flass knows.
- He won't talk.

855
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,040
He'll talk to me.

856
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,320
Commissioner Loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you.

857
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,040
He thinks you're dangerous.

858
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,440
What do you think?

859
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,320
I think you're trying to help.

860
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,720
But I've been wrong before.

861
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,040
Come on, I ain't got all night.

862
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,240
Flass, I have kids to feed.

863
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,240
What, they don't like falafel?

864
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,320
Where were the other drugs going?

865
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,280
I never knew. I don't know.

866
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,920
- I swear to God.
- Swear to me!

867
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,960
I don't know. I never knew. Never.

868
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,280
They went to some guy
for a couple of days...

869
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,680
- before they went to the dealers.
- Why?

870
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,840
There was something,
something else in the drugs

871
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,680
- something hidden.
- What?

872
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,080
I never went to the drop-off point.
It was in the Narrows.

873
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:20,920
Cops only go there
when they're in force.

874
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
- Do I look like a cop?
- No!

875
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:38,960
This is the one I'm talking about.

876
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,640
- What's your problem with it?
- It shouldn't exist.

877
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:45,520
This ship left Singapore with
246 containers but arrived with 247.

878
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,656
So, I'm guessing there's something
I'm not supposed to find in there.

879
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:51,320
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna
know what's in Mr Falcone's crate.

880
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:54,480
Things are working a little
differently now. Open it up.

881
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,120
What the hell is this?

882
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:49,400
It's you, isn't it? Everybody's
been talking about you.

883
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,760
- Get in here!
- Don't you yell at him!

884
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,640
The other kids won't believe me.

885
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,840
Get rid of all traces.

886
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,920
- Better torch the whole place.
- All right.

887
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:00,600
Having trouble?
Take a seat. Have a drink.

888
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,440
You look like a man who
takes himself too seriously.

889
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,800
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.

890
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:03,680
Alfred?

891
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:19,560
Take... blood. Take the poison,
my poison, poisonous.

892
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,120
Bruce...

893
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,240
Why do we fall?

894
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,360
- How long was I out?
- Two days.

895
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,480
It's your birthday.

896
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,600
Many happy returns.

897
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:56,000
I've felt these effects before,
but this was so much more potent.

898
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:00,680
It was some kind of hallucinogen,
weaponized, in aerosol form.

899
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,600
You have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs, Mr Wayne.

900
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,600
I called Mr Fox when your condition
worsened after the first day.

901
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:09,760
I analyzed your blood, isolating
the receptor compounds...

902
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,680
and the protein-based catalysts.

903
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,840
Am I meant to understand any of that?

904
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,160
Not at all. I just wanted you
to know how hard it was.

905
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,880
Bottom line, I synthesized
an antidote.

906
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,000
Could you make more?

907
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,480
You planning on gassing yourself
again, Mr Wayne?

908
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,640
Well, you know how it is, Mr Fox.

909
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,176
You're out at night looking for kicks

910
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,760
someone's passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens.

911
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:30,920
I'll bring what I have.

912
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,120
The antidote should
inoculate you for now.

913
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,520
Alfred, always a pleasure.

914
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,160
Lucius.

915
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:42,896
You sure you don't want to come in?

916
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,680
I have to get back.
I just wanted to leave this.

917
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,080
- Thank you.
- Rachel?

918
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,040
Looks like someone's been
burning the candle at both ends.

919
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,680
- Must've been quite an occasion.
- It is my birthday.

920
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:57,120
I know. I'm sorry,
I can't come tonight.

921
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,376
I was just dropping off your present.

922
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,760
You've got better plans?

923
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,920
My boss has been missing for
two days, which in this town...

924
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,136
means that I should probably start
by looking at the bottom...

925
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,440
- of the river. Excuse me.
- Rachel.

926
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,320
Rachel Dawes.

927
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:14,160
Who authorized that?
Get Crane down there now.

928
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,400
Do not take no for an answer.

929
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,456
Call Dr Lehmann, tell him
we'll need our own assessment...

930
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,320
on the Judge's desk by morning.

931
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,240
- What's wrong?
- It's Falcone.

932
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,880
Dr Crane moved him to Arkham
Asylum on suicide watch.

933
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:27,000
You're going to Arkham now?
It's in the Narrows, Rachel.

934
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:31,400
You enjoy your party, Bruce.
Some of us have work to do.

935
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,840
You be careful.

936
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,520
Happy birthday.

937
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,400
But Master Wayne,
the guests will be arriving.

938
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,000
Keep them happy until I arrive.
Tell them that joke you know.

939
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:38,960
Having fun?

940
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,560
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you
doing in a place like this?

941
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:51,160
I need some information.
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1-ME.

942
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,360
1-ME.

943
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:55,256
It's a microwave emitter.
It was designed...

944
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,320
to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

945
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,640
Rumor was, they tested dispersing...

946
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:02,520
water-based chemical agents
into the air, but...

947
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:03,960
isn't that illegal?

948
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:09,400
I want all the information on
the development of this project

949
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:13,640
all data, files, backup disks,
on my desk right away.

950
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,040
Did you lose one?

951
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,440
I'm merging your department
with Archives.

952
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,480
And I am firing you.

953
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,960
Didn't you get the memo?

954
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,400
Scarecrow.

955
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,200
Scarecrow.

956
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,280
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

957
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:52,096
I have nothing further to add on
to the report I filed with the judge.

958
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,360
- I have questions about your report.
- Such as?

959
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,920
Isn't it convenient for
a fifty-two-year-old man...

960
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,880
who has no history of
mental illness...

961
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,320
to suddenly have a complete
psychotic breakdown just when...

962
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,616
- he's about to be indicted?
- As you can see for yourself

963
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:06,840
there is nothing convenient
about his symptoms.

964
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,640
- Scarecrow.
- What's scarecrow?

965
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,520
Patients suffering
delusional episodes...

966
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:18,480
often focus their paranoia
on an external tormentor

967
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:21,440
usually one conforming to
Jungian archetypes.

968
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,280
In this case, a scarecrow.

969
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:26,640
He's drugged?

970
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,640
Psychopharmacology is
my primary field.

971
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,400
I'm a strong advocate.

972
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,720
Outside, he was a giant.

973
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,520
In here, only the mind
can grant you power.

974
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,320
You enjoy the reversal.

975
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,240
I respect the mind's power
over the body.

976
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,040
It's why I do what I do.

977
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:46,240
I do what I do to keep thugs
like Falcone behind bars

978
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,840
not in therapy.

979
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:51,440
I want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to Falcone

980
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:52,800
including blood work.

981
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,696
Find out what exactly
you've put him on.

982
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:57,160
- First thing tomorrow then.
- Tonight.

983
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,280
I've already paged Dr Lehmann
at County General.

984
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,360
As you wish.

985
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,600
This way, please.

986
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
There's something
I think you should see.

987
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:26,120
This is where we make the medicine.

988
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,080
Perhaps you should have some.

989
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,120
Clear your head.

990
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,320
Who knows you're here?

991
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,800
Who knows?

992
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,240
He's here.

993
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,640
Who?

994
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,960
The Batman.

995
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,320
What do we do?

996
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:22,720
What anyone does when
a prowler comes around.

997
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,000
Call the police.

998
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,760
You want the cops here?

999
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,480
At this point, they can't stop us.

1000
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:33,240
But the Batman has
a talent for disruption.

1001
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:36,440
Force him outside, the police
will take him down. Go.

1002
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,560
- What about her?
- She hasn't got long.

1003
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:42,480
I gave her a concentrated dose.
The mind can only take so much.

1004
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,080
Now, go.

1005
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,640
The things they say about him.

1006
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,440
Can he really fly?

1007
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,520
I heard he can disappear.

1008
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,600
Well, we'll find out.

1009
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,360
Won't we?

1010
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,240
Taste of your own medicine, Doctor?

1011
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,080
What have you been doing here?

1012
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,320
Who are you working for?

1013
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:02,800
Ra's...

1014
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,080
Ra's Al Ghul.

1015
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:08,640
Ra's Al Ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?

1016
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,440
Crane?

1017
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,720
Dr Crane isn't here right now.

1018
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,880
But if you'd like to make
an appointment...

1019
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:33,240
Batman! Put down your weapons
and surrender.

1020
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,200
You are surrounded.

1021
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,160
What are you waiting for?

1022
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:42,760
Backup.

1023
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,600
Backup?

1024
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,760
The Batman's in there.
SWAT's on the way

1025
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,080
but if you wanna go in now,
I'll be right behind you, Sir.

1026
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,560
SWAT's on the way.

1027
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,120
- Hey!
- Hey!

1028
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,920
What's happened to her?

1029
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,320
Crane poisoned her with
a psychotropic hallucinogen

1030
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,960
a panic-inducing toxin.

1031
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,760
Let me get her down to the medics.

1032
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,760
They can't help her, but I can.

1033
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:55,360
Get her downstairs. Meet me
in the alley on the Narrows side.

1034
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:05,360
Crane's been smuggling his toxin,
hidden in Falcone's drugs...

1035
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,040
and then dumping it
in the water supply.

1036
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,720
- What was he planning?
- I don't know.

1037
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,200
Was he working for Falcone?

1038
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,720
He mentioned someone else,
someone worse.

1039
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,216
I need to get her the antidote...

1040
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:16,640
before the damage becomes
permanent.

1041
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:18,880
- How long does she have?
- Not long.

1042
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,040
What is that?

1043
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:27,720
- Backup.
- What the...

1044
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,960
Stay put!

1045
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:50,400
- Take cover!
- Get off me!

1046
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,760
Get off me! Get it off me!

1047
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,160
Excuse me.

1048
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,640
- How is she?
- She's fading. We gotta go.

1049
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,120
I'll get my car.

1050
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,760
I brought mine!

1051
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,480
Yours?

1052
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:10,080
I've gotta get me one of those.

1053
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,120
- He is in a vehicle.
- Make and color?

1054
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:17,600
It's a black... tank.

1055
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,640
Stay calm.

1056
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:23,680
You've been poisoned.

1057
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:28,040
I'm on him.

1058
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:37,440
Breathe slowly.

1059
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,080
Hold on.

1060
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:03,560
- What are you doing?
- Shortcut.

1061
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:12,760
Air One to Ground, block that ramp!

1062
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,200
He's got no way off that roof.

1063
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:23,640
Turn off your engine!
Step away from the car.

1064
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:28,280
- Trust me.
- Weapons system activated.

1065
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,440
Who is this guy?

1066
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,800
- Where's he going?
- He's on the roof!

1067
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,320
What street is he taking?

1068
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:06,600
He's not on a street!
He's flying on rooftops!

1069
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:46,400
At least tell me what it looks like.

1070
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:49,920
Never mind.

1071
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,240
Got him.

1072
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,200
We're coming right up on his butt.

1073
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:33,720
We're tracking suspect vehicle
heading west on I-17.

1074
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:39,880
- Air One to Ground,
- I lost him.

1075
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,160
We've lost visual.
Exit nine is blocked.

1076
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:43,400
We'll move back to check...

1077
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:46,280
- the frontage roads.
- Stealth mode activated.

1078
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,160
Stay with me.

1079
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:55,040
What? There he is!

1080
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,600
Just hold on!

1081
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,720
Rachel!

1082
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:53,656
They get any of this crap
into the mains?

1083
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:55,640
- Oh yeah.
- Notify the water company.

1084
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,136
There's gotta be
a way of isolating the area's...

1085
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:59,040
No, you don't understand.
They put it all in.

1086
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:00,336
They must have been
at this for weeks.

1087
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,280
Gotham's entire water supply
is laced with it.

1088
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:03,920
Why haven't we felt the effects?

1089
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,400
Must be a compound that has to be
absorbed through the lungs.

1090
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:17,360
How do you feel?

1091
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:23,280
Where are we? Why did you
bring me here?

1092
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:26,960
If I hadn't, your mind would
now be lost. You were poisoned.

1093
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,760
- It was Dr Crane.
- Rest.

1094
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,280
Gordon has Crane.

1095
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:33,960
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1096
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:38,640
I don't have the luxury of friends.
I'm gonna give you a sedative.

1097
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,280
You'll wake up back at home.

1098
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:44,160
When you do, get these to Gordon
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1099
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:46,040
- What are they?
- The antidote.

1100
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:49,640
One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.

1101
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:50,880
Mass production?

1102
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:54,520
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.

1103
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:22,120
When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham

1104
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:25,280
the only thing that stopped me from
calling the men in white coats...

1105
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,680
was when you said that
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1106
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:30,640
- It's not.
- What would you call that?

1107
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:35,320
- Damn good television.
- It's a miracle no one was killed.

1108
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,760
I didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.

1109
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:41,880
You're getting lost inside
this monster of yours.

1110
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,240
I'm using this monster
to help other people

1111
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,520
just like my father did.

1112
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:49,360
For Thomas Wayne, helping others
wasn't about proving anything...

1113
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,440
to anyone, including himself.

1114
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:56,640
It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.
She's downstairs, sedated.

1115
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:57,880
I need you to take her home.

1116
01:35:58,200 --> 01:35:59,640
Well, we both care for Rachel, Sir.

1117
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:01,640
But what you're doing
has to be beyond that.

1118
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:04,520
It can't be personal,
or you're just a vigilante.

1119
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:06,320
- Is Fox still here?
- Yes, Sir.

1120
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,160
We need to send
these people away now.

1121
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:10,280
Those are Bruce Wayne's
guests out there, Sir.

1122
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:13,200
- You have a name to maintain...
- I don't care about my name.

1123
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:15,040
It's not just your name, Sir.

1124
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:16,960
It's your father's name.

1125
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,760
And it's all that's left of him.

1126
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,640
Don't destroy it.

1127
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:27,760
"Happy birthday to you"

1128
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,720
"Happy birthday to you"

1129
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:34,520
"Happy birthday, dear Bruce"

1130
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:38,320
"Happy birthday to you"

1131
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:39,480
Mr Earle.

1132
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,600
- Happy birthday, Bruce.
- Thank you.

1133
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:44,280
How did the stock offering go?

1134
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:47,000
- Prices soared.
- Who was buying?

1135
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:50,480
All kinds of funds and brokerages.
It's a bit technical.

1136
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,440
The key thing is...

1137
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,880
our company's future is secure.

1138
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:58,240
Great.

1139
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:12,720
A little the worse for wear,
I'm afraid.

1140
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,800
What was the plan, Crane?

1141
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:22,640
How were you going to get
your toxin into the air?

1142
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:26,000
Scarecrow.

1143
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,880
Who were you working for, Crane?

1144
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,240
It's too late.

1145
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,080
You can't stop it now.

1146
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:40,680
Here.

1147
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,040
- Happy birthday, Bruce.
- Thank you. Thanks.

1148
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,440
And thank you for that item.

1149
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:50,000
You're welcome. I know
you'll put it to good use.

1150
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:51,480
I already have.

1151
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:54,880
How long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale?

1152
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Weeks. Why?

1153
01:37:57,160 --> 01:38:00,360
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

1154
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:03,680
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

1155
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,320
What?

1156
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:08,760
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

1157
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:11,160
to vaporize all the water
in the mains.

1158
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:15,760
A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1159
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:16,920
Misplaced?

1160
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:19,960
Earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it.

1161
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,256
I need you to go back to
Wayne Enterprises right now...

1162
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:25,840
and start making more
of that antidote.

1163
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,616
I think the police are gonna
need as much as they can...

1164
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:28,760
get their hands on, okay?

1165
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:31,040
My security clearance
has been revoked.

1166
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:33,240
That wouldn't stop a man
like you now, would it?

1167
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,840
I suppose not.

1168
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:39,840
- Bruce, there's somebody here...
- Not now, Mrs Delane.

1169
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,400
You must meet.

1170
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:47,120
Now, am I pronouncing this right,
Mr Ra's Al Ghul?

1171
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,440
You're not Ra's Al Ghul.

1172
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,840
I watched him die.

1173
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,680
But is Ra's Al Ghul immortal?

1174
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:05,240
Are his methods supernatural?

1175
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:13,920
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?

1176
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:17,320
Surely a man who spends his nights...

1177
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:19,680
scrambling over
the rooftops of Gotham...

1178
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:22,080
wouldn't begrudge me dual identities?

1179
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:24,200
I saved your life.

1180
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:27,080
I warned you about compassion,
Bruce.

1181
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,640
Your quarrel is with me.

1182
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,640
You let these people go.

1183
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:38,400
You are welcome to explain
the situation to them.

1184
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:42,240
Everyone!

1185
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,520
Everybody?

1186
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:48,800
I...

1187
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,416
I want to thank you all
for coming here tonight...

1188
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,080
and drinking all of my booze.

1189
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,120
No, really.

1190
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,680
There's a thing about
being a Wayne that...

1191
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:03,520
you're never short of
a few freeloaders

1192
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:05,920
like yourselves to fill up
your mansion with.

1193
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,320
So, here's to you people. Thank you.

1194
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,120
That's enough, Bruce.

1195
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:11,280
I'm not finished.

1196
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:14,640
To all of you... all of you phonies

1197
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:17,400
all of you two-faced friends

1198
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:22,400
you sycophantic suck-ups who smile
through your teeth at me

1199
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:28,120
please leave me in peace. Please go.

1200
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:32,280
Stop smiling, it's not
a joke. Please leave.

1201
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:34,360
The party's over, get out.

1202
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:38,240
The apple has fallen very far
from the tree, Mr Wayne.

1203
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:52,040
Amusing.

1204
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:54,000
But pointless.

1205
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,080
None of these people
have long to live.

1206
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:59,000
Your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand.

1207
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:01,560
So, Crane was working for you.

1208
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,640
His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.

1209
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:07,480
He was able to weaponize it.

1210
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:09,800
He's not a member of
the League of Shadows?

1211
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:13,840
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.

1212
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:19,200
But really, you are gonna release
Crane's poison on the entire city.

1213
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:23,760
Then, watch Gotham
tear itself apart through fear.

1214
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,640
You're gonna destroy
millions of lives.

1215
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:41,120
Only a cynical man would call what
these people have "lives", Wayne.

1216
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:45,440
Crime. Despair. This is not
how man was supposed to live.

1217
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,520
The League of Shadows has been
a check against human corruption...

1218
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,120
for thousands of years.

1219
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:54,080
We sacked Rome. Loaded trade ships
with plague rats.

1220
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,440
Burned London to the ground.

1221
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,440
Every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence

1222
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:00,520
we return to restore the balance.

1223
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:02,600
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1224
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,920
Give me more time.
There are good people here.

1225
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,720
You're defending a city
so corrupt we have infiltrated...

1226
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:11,280
every level of its infrastructure.

1227
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:22,920
Time to play.

1228
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:29,280
When I found you in that jail,
you were lost.

1229
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:31,280
But I believed in you.

1230
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,240
I took away your fear
and I showed you a path.

1231
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,560
You were my greatest student.

1232
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:41,280
It should be you standing
by my side, saving the world.

1233
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:43,800
I'll be standing where I belong

1234
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:48,000
between you and the people of
Gotham.

1235
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:51,800
No one can save Gotham.

1236
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:56,760
When a forest grows too wild

1237
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:59,240
a purging fire is
inevitable and natural.

1238
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,800
Tomorrow, the world
will watch in horror...

1239
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:05,040
as its greatest city destroys itself.

1240
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:09,080
The movement back to harmony
will be unstoppable this time.

1241
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:11,680
- You attacked Gotham before?
- Of course.

1242
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:14,440
Over the ages, our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.

1243
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,320
With Gotham, we tried
a new one. Economics.

1244
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,920
But we underestimated
certain of Gotham's citizens

1245
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:24,560
such as your parents.

1246
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:31,760
Gunned down by one of the very
people they were trying to help.

1247
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:34,720
Create enough hunger and
everyone becomes a criminal.

1248
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:37,480
Their deaths galvanized
the city into saving itself...

1249
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:40,040
and Gotham has limped on ever since.

1250
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:42,360
We are back to finish the job.

1251
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:45,920
And this time, no misguided
idealists will get in the way.

1252
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:47,640
Like your father,
you lack the courage...

1253
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,560
to do all that is necessary.

1254
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,480
If someone stands in the way
of true justice

1255
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:56,600
you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart.

1256
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:02,400
I am gonna stop you.

1257
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,960
You never did learn
to mind your surroundings.

1258
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:09,400
Justice is balance.

1259
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:12,040
You burned my house
and left me for dead.

1260
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:15,840
Consider us even.

1261
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:34,080
No one comes out. Make sure.

1262
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:44,680
They're all gone?

1263
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:46,320
How many were from maximum
security?

1264
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:49,440
Every one of them.
Serial killers, rapists.

1265
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:50,840
Get them to raise the bridges

1266
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,536
we don't want any
getting off the island.

1267
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:53,800
Yeah, I'll raise the bridges...

1268
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:56,440
when I get every
available unit out here...

1269
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:59,560
to catch the homicidal maniacs
that are running loose out there.

1270
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,120
Come on!

1271
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:25,880
I hope you're not a member
of the fire brigade.

1272
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:33,640
Master Wayne!

1273
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,576
What is the point of
all those push-ups...

1274
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,800
if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1275
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:21,240
What have I done, Alfred?

1276
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:25,440
Everything my family,
my father built...

1277
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:31,920
The Wayne legacy is more than
bricks and mortar, Sir.

1278
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:33,760
I wanted to save Gotham.

1279
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:36,480
I failed.

1280
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:39,640
Why do we fall, Sir?

1281
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:45,200
So that we can learn
to pick ourselves up.

1282
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:49,720
You still haven't given up on me?

1283
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:53,360
Never.

1284
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:55,720
Down!

1285
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:58,240
Harassment! I see harassment!

1286
01:46:58,640 --> 01:47:00,480
Maybe you'd like to see
some excessive force?

1287
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,080
- Hey!
- Madman with a gun.

1288
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:06,520
With residents furious
at the unprecedented show...

1289
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:08,560
of police strength
to round up the inmates...

1290
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:10,600
Lady, we're about
to raise these bridges.

1291
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:13,600
Officer, I'm a Gotham City
district attorney, let me pass.

1292
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:22,720
- You shut up!
- Flass, cool it!

1293
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:25,000
Hold these people back.

1294
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:27,280
Hey, Gordon, there's
somebody here to see you.

1295
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:28,720
What're you doing here?

1296
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,280
Our mutual friend sent me with this.

1297
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:33,480
It counteracts Crane's toxin.
Hopefully, you won't need it.

1298
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:36,200
Not unless he's got some way of
getting that crap into the air.

1299
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:39,720
All right, last one across.

1300
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:42,960
Come on, people, they want
this bridge up...

1301
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,720
in no more than three minutes!

1302
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,616
We better get you off the island
before they raise the bridges.

1303
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:47,960
Patrolman!

1304
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,320
Go!

1305
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:17,000
I can't find my mom.

1306
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:18,840
Hey!

1307
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:28,320
What the hell are you doing?

1308
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:31,360
Gentlemen.

1309
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,920
Time to spread the word.

1310
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:37,480
And the word is...

1311
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:39,880
panic.

1312
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:04,960
Jesus! The pressure, it's spiking.

1313
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:07,200
Right there.

1314
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,760
That water main is
right under the Narrows.

1315
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,120
It's okay.

1316
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:00,440
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1317
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:03,280
Come on, somebody
talk to me. Come on!

1318
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:24,680
This is Gordon.

1319
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:26,136
What the hell is going on in there?

1320
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:27,800
We need reinforcements.

1321
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:30,840
- TAC teams, SWATs, riot cops!
- Gordon!

1322
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:33,600
All the city's riot police
are on the island with you!

1323
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:36,000
Well, they're completely
incapacitated!

1324
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:39,160
It's okay. No one's gonna hurt you.

1325
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,440
Of course they are!

1326
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:45,400
- Crane?
- No. Scarecrow!

1327
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:50,240
Gordon. There's
nobody left to send in.

1328
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:53,480
So, I'm on my own?

1329
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,480
The Narrows is
tearing itself to pieces.

1330
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:02,056
This is just the beginning. If they
hit the whole city with toxin

1331
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:04,960
there's nothing to stop Gotham
tearing itself apart from mass panic.

1332
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:07,096
- How're they gonna do that?
- They'll be using the train.

1333
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:08,640
The monorail follows
the water mains...

1334
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:10,880
to the central hub
beneath Wayne Tower.

1335
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,536
If they get their machine
into Wayne Station

1336
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:14,440
it'll cause a chain reaction
that'll vaporize...

1337
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:16,000
the entire city's water supply.

1338
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:18,640
- Covering Gotham in this poison.
- I'm gonna stop him...

1339
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:21,120
from loading that train,
but I may need your help.

1340
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:23,160
- What do you need?
- Can you drive stick?

1341
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:29,760
There you are!

1342
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:32,000
There is nothing to fear...

1343
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:34,560
but fear itself!

1344
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:36,920
I am here to help...

1345
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:10,040
The Batman will save us. He'll come.

1346
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:16,320
- He'll come.
- Don't peek.

1347
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:28,160
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.

1348
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:35,120
I told you he'd come.

1349
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:41,800
Wait!

1350
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:45,920
You could die.
At least tell me your name.

1351
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:57,320
It's not who I am underneath,
but what I do that defines me.

1352
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:00,000
Bruce?

1353
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:35,320
Well, well. You took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally.

1354
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,840
- It ends here.
- For you and the police, maybe.

1355
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:40,160
My fight, however, lies with
the rest of Gotham.

1356
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:43,200
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a city to destroy.

1357
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:45,680
I can't beat two of your pawns?

1358
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:47,080
As you wish.

1359
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:01,240
GPS online.

1360
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:09,680
In one hundred yards.

1361
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:41,560
Gentlemen.

1362
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:09,440
Who the hell authorized this?

1363
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:22,360
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

1364
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:31,440
The pressure's moving along
the mains, blowing all the pipes.

1365
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:32,840
If that pressure reaches us

1366
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:36,360
the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!

1367
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:48,720
At the next intersection, turn right.

1368
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:14,080
You will never learn.

1369
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:22,640
Sorry.

1370
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,760
Familiar. Don't you
have anything new?

1371
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:29,160
How about this?

1372
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:47,440
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.

1373
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:01,040
Evacuate the building.

1374
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:03,840
We're right on top of the main hub
and it's gonna blow!

1375
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:14,240
Weapons system activated.

1376
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:19,640
Nice ride.

1377
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:35,200
Armed.

1378
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:47,800
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1379
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:51,840
Come on.

1380
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:58,200
You are just an ordinary man
in a cape.

1381
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,896
That's why you couldn't
fight injustice...

1382
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:02,000
and that's why you can't
stop this train.

1383
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:04,600
Who said anything about stopping it?

1384
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:11,520
Yes!

1385
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:22,640
You'll never learn
to mind your surroundings!

1386
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:32,960
Have you finally learned
to do what is necessary?

1387
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:34,560
I won't kill you.

1388
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:41,520
But I don't have to save you.

1389
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:56,960
- The meeting's already started.
- What meeting?

1390
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:03,840
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.

1391
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:05,400
You did.

1392
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:07,320
I got another job.

1393
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:09,920
Yours.

1394
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:12,000
On whose authority?

1395
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:14,480
Batman may have made the front page

1396
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:17,320
but Bruce Wayne
got pushed to page eight.

1397
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:24,960
Bruce Wayne.

1398
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:28,800
What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1399
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,560
- The fact that I'm the owner.
- What are you talking about?

1400
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:33,600
The company went public a week ago.

1401
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:35,360
And I bought most of the shares...

1402
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:38,600
through various charitable
foundations and trusts and so forth.

1403
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:42,840
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing is that...

1404
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:45,360
my company's future is secure.

1405
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:48,840
- Right, Mr Fox?
- Right you are, Mr Wayne.

1406
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:53,160
Didn't you get the memo?

1407
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,080
I'm sorry I didn't tell you

1408
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:14,040
- Rachel.
- No, Bruce.

1409
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:15,480
I'm sorry.

1410
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:18,600
The day that Chill died, I...

1411
02:01:20,720 --> 02:01:22,480
I said terrible things.

1412
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:24,040
But true things.

1413
02:01:25,080 --> 02:01:26,640
I was a coward with a gun...

1414
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:30,800
and justice is about
more than revenge, so thank you.

1415
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:33,800
I never stopped thinking about you...

1416
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:37,000
about us.

1417
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:39,720
And when I heard you were back, I...

1418
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:42,080
I started to hope.

1419
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:08,040
But then, I found out
about your mask.

1420
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:11,400
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1421
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:13,840
No, this...

1422
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:16,440
is your mask.

1423
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:22,360
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.

1424
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:27,120
The man I loved, the man who
vanished

1425
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:30,200
he never came back at all.

1426
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:36,720
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

1427
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:42,840
Maybe someday, when Gotham
no longer needs Batman

1428
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:45,400
I'll see him again.

1429
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:58,760
- Proved me wrong, you know.
- About what?

1430
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:05,600
Your father would be very proud
of you. Just like me.

1431
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:33,320
What will you do?

1432
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:36,240
Rebuild it.

1433
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:39,440
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1434
02:03:46,160 --> 02:03:47,680
Just the way it was, Sir?

1435
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:50,440
Yeah, why?

1436
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:53,480
I thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

1437
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:55,520
improving the foundations.

1438
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:59,200
- In the southeast corner?
- Precisely, Sir.

1439
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:15,080
Nice.

1440
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:17,360
I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1441
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:20,200
- Well, Sergeant?
- It's Lieutenant now.

1442
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:21,880
You really started something.

1443
02:04:22,240 --> 02:04:25,560
Bent cops running scared.
Hope on the streets.

1444
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:26,760
But?

1445
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:28,760
The Narrows is lost.

1446
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:31,096
And we still haven't
picked up Crane...

1447
02:04:31,120 --> 02:04:33,560
or half the inmates
of Arkham that he freed.

1448
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:35,560
We will.

1449
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:37,320
We can bring Gotham back.

1450
02:04:37,640 --> 02:04:40,080
- What about escalation?
- Escalation?

1451
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:43,880
We start carrying semi-automatics,
they buy automatics.

1452
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:48,680
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1453
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:51,760
- And?
- And you're wearing a mask...

1454
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:54,360
and jumping off rooftops.

1455
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:56,760
Now, take this guy.

1456
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:59,600
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1457
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:03,040
Got a taste for
the theatrical, like you.

1458
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:04,760
Leaves a calling card.

1459
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:12,280
I'll look into it.

1460
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:17,360
I never said thank you.

1461
02:05:22,160 --> 02:05:23,240
And you'll never have to.
