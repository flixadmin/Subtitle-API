1
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:05,756
Robin!

2
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:08,010
I heard what happened to Robin.

3
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:10,596
She wasn't in the street,
she was one step off the kerb.

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,056
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- Name's Butcher. Billy Butcher.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,226
Supes lose hundreds of people
each year to collateral damage.

6
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,478
- That's where I come in.
- To do what?

7
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,984
Frenchie, I need your help.

8
00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:27,821
- Who is he?
- This here is Hughie Campbell.

9
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,203
Hughie, Mother's Milk.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,581
- Who's that?
- She's a Supe terrorist.

11
00:00:37,664 --> 00:00:39,208
- Her name's Kimiko.
- Bonjour, Kimiko.

12
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:43,879
I've always wanted to be in The Seven.

13
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:46,423
Please welcome Starlight!

14
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:49,426
It's just a question of how bad
you wanna be in The Seven.

15
00:00:50,594 --> 00:00:54,431
We are going to be stationing you
in Sandusky, Ohio, for a while.

16
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:59,187
- I'm Hughie.
- Annie. Would you like my number?

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,069
Looks like you got your tongue
halfway down the opposition's throat.

18
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:09,154
- She's not a bad person.
- She's a Supe.

19
00:01:09,238 --> 00:01:12,157
Hugh Campbell killed Translucent.
What if he was helped?

20
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:15,327
- Whoa.
- Keep those hands down by your side.

21
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,120
You have to explain, Hughie.

22
00:01:17,204 --> 00:01:19,081
You were the only thing I could count on.

23
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:21,792
This is about Compound V.
It gives Supes their powers.

24
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:24,378
What are you talking about?
We're born like this.

25
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:27,714
That was diabolical!

26
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:32,344
No one's putting Supes
in the national defence.

27
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:34,388
Stay the fuck back or I'll laser you!

28
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:39,351
<i>If they let us into the military,
this will never happen again.</i>

29
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:41,436
I know what it's like to lose someone.

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,605
Homelander raped my wife, Becca.

31
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:45,482
You and me, we're in this together.

32
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:58,078
We have to go back. This will never stop.
It's just gonna be more blood.

33
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:00,580
If you don't like to play,
why did you join the team?

34
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:06,461
- You came here without Butcher?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:10,965
I'm out.

36
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:17,973
- You came.
- I'm a fucking superhero.

37
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:20,851
He's having a heart attack.

38
00:02:23,854 --> 00:02:27,607
No more lies. You fucking promised me.

39
00:02:32,946 --> 00:02:35,615
Hey, pal. I'm your father.

40
00:02:37,743 --> 00:02:38,743
Becca.

41
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:05,228
Baby kale salad?

42
00:03:08,148 --> 00:03:09,900
I'm on page 134.

43
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:13,653
Chain of command doesn't apply to
other military contractors in the field,

44
00:03:13,737 --> 00:03:16,531
- I don't see why it should apply to us.
- Caprese sandwich?

45
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:20,702
When they're in actual combat,
whom exactly do your heroes report to?

46
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:24,247
Same person as always. Me.

Subheading 16.

53
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,730
We need a top secret,
Yankee white designation for Compound V.

54
00:03:48,814 --> 00:03:51,400
Come on, Stan. Only one man okays that.

Hell, yes.

We'd prefer stronger wording.

Exactly what casualty allowance
are we looking at here?

70
00:04:32,232 --> 00:04:34,776
Officially? Zero, of course.

Thirty-four percent.

That's too wordy.

75

"Burn in Truth!"

00:04:56,423 --> 00:04:57,423

102
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:01,947
that Black Noir has conducted an operation

103
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:05,116
killing the super-terrorist
known as Naqib.

104
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:12,749
But that doesn't mean
sacrifices won't still be made.

105
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:20,048
The proof of that, sadly, lies before us.

106
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:25,428
For today, we mourn
a fallen member of The Seven.

107
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,223
Translucent.

108
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:33,812
Murdered in cold blood
by the cartel super-terrorist El Diablo.

109
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:41,570
Before he left, Translucent said to me...

110
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:46,533
almost as if he knew
something was gonna happen,

111
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:49,661
he said, "Hey, Homelander.

112
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,956
Tell my son Maverick that I love him."

113
00:06:55,709 --> 00:07:00,630
He also said,
"You find those super-terrorists."

114
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:03,675
Well, "super villains" is really
the only term,

115
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:06,845
but he said, "You find them, Homelander.

116
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:09,639
And you stop them."

117
00:07:10,265 --> 00:07:12,392
So I say to you, Maverick,

118
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:17,814
and to all the sons and daughters
of this great nation, I will stop them.

119
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:22,277
I will save you.

120
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:28,491
I'll do it for you.

121
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:32,120
For America.

122
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:42,297
For a dear...

123
00:07:43,465 --> 00:07:44,716
dear old friend.

124
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:50,847
Goodbye, brother.

00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:18,369
Well, I'm not gonna lie, it's hard.

161

The burner phone,
did you snap the SIM card?

208
00:14:23,448 --> 00:14:24,574
Jesus.

209
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:29,287
- When was the last time you slept?
- Head down. Sorry. I just...

210
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:34,125
I'm wanted,
and you're kind of super famous, so...

211
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:40,173
- Did you snap the card...? Okay.
- Yes. Yes, I snapped the card, okay?

212
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:44,260
And no one followed me down here.
They can't trace my chip down here.

213
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,137
We're okay.

214
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:53,643
You look good.

215
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:57,023
Yeah, you... you look good too.

216
00:14:57,106 --> 00:14:58,858
You look very, you know...

217
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:00,567
Uh...

218
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,946
Yeah, I'm lying. I'm sorry.

219
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,698
- You look like shit.
- I know.

220
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:09,702
- I know.
- Where are you guys living?

221
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,832
Club Med in Ibiza. It's been awesome.

222
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:18,377
- Foam parties will change your life.
- Idiot.

223
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:30,264
Oh. Um...

224

Oh, shit.

I know him.

227
00:15:44,362 --> 00:15:45,363
- You do?
- Yeah.

228
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:50,409
I mean, not for a while,
but, yes, from my Capes for Christ days.

229
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,621
Are you sure you can do this?

230
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:56,707
I have a choice?

231
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:06,134
Hey, I...

232
00:16:06,926 --> 00:16:11,139
I saw a really great picture of you
at the Teen Choice Awards with, um...

233
00:16:11,222 --> 00:16:14,183
What's his name, Ansel Adams?

234
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:16,602
Alden Ehrenreich.

235
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:20,481
- Are you stalking me on Instagram?
- No.

236
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,942
No, of course not. Get over yourself.

237
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,278
So did the PR people
put you together or what's...?

238
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:27,738
- No, he's a nice guy.
- He's an actor.

239
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:32,034
He's an actor
who didn't lie to my face every day.

240
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:36,789
Okay, yeah, I got it. Ouch.

241
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:41,544
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

242
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,671
I... Hughie, I just...

243
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:51,469
Hey.

244
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:54,307
Get some sleep.

245
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,352
I'll sleep when I know you're safe.

246
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:11,365
You think this is fun?

247
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:14,660
You think water is supposed to be fun?

248
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:18,831
Try swimming in the Mariana Trench,
you little fucking idiots!

249
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:21,042
Yeah, not so fun now.

250
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:26,589
No, it's dark and it's cold,
and you're so alone.

251
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,053
You're so goddamn fucking alone.

252
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:45,149
Swim free, little fish. You made bail.

253
00:17:56,786 --> 00:17:57,786
Hey, man.

Yeah, you're Raven... Ravenwing.

00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:12,051
It's Eagle. Eagle the Archer.

Out of Cleveland.
We met, like, five times at Vought Con.

I mean, mm, nope, that doesn't matter.

261
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,643

- Yeah.

262

Dirty Dozen, Lee Marvin.
Beatles, Brian Epstein.

00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:08,222
- I liked it.
- Yeah, me too. It was great.

317
00:23:09,557 --> 00:23:13,894
Homelander, I just wanna thank you again
for recommending me for this job.

318
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:17,773
I was so surprised
to get the call.

319
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:23,279
I am gonna fill Miss Stillwell's shoes
as best I can.

320
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:26,615
God rest her soul.

321
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:31,412
Yeah. God rest it. Yeah.

322
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:36,875
Any luck catching her killer?
That Butcher maniac?

323
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:41,422
No. Not yet.

324
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,632
But we will.

325
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:46,844
Oh, good news.

326
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:48,512
I think I found a hero.

327
00:23:48,596 --> 00:23:51,056
Perfect candidate to replace Translucent.

328
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:53,851
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

329
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:55,811
So soon?

330
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,272
He's in the gym right now.
You wanna meet him?

331
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:01,358
Do I? Lead the way.

332
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:14,997
That's Blindspot, right?

333
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,708
A differently abled member of The Seven.

334
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:22,338
We'll poll through the roof
with millennials.

335
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:24,715
Inclusion's a big priority for them.

336
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:25,841
Amazing.

337
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:28,719
And then I think we find an ethnic
or female or, fingers crossed,

338
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:31,889
an ethnic female
to replace The Deep, and we're golden.

339
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:40,481
Homelander, wow, you're...

340
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:42,816
It's an honour, sir.

341
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,195
Wait. Hold on. You can tell it's me?

342
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:47,363
Mm-hm.

343
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:49,782
Wow.

344
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:52,159
That's impressive.

345
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,536
You don't need super eyes
when you have super ears.

346
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,539
Can I just say, "That is amazing"?

347
00:24:57,623 --> 00:25:00,834
And you, my friend, are a true hero.

348
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:03,504
Not because of what you do
for a job, but...

349
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:07,257
- Because of what you've overcome.
- Thank you.

350
00:25:08,384 --> 00:25:10,260
That means everything, coming from you.

351
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:12,262
Oh. Stop it. Come on.

352
00:25:13,097 --> 00:25:14,890
Hey, guys, um...

353
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:17,768
- I just have one question if that's okay.
- Yeah.

354
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:18,936
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

355
00:25:19,687 --> 00:25:21,063
All right. So...

356
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:27,194
What happens if, I don't know, I do this?

357
00:25:34,118 --> 00:25:37,329
And now you're just another useless,
fucking blind guy.

358
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:44,294
This must be some kind of a joke, Ashley.

359
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:48,590
What made you think I would ever allow
a cripple into The Seven?

360
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:51,719
For fuck's sakes, Ashley,
don't look at him. Look at me.

361
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:56,473
Ashley! Look at me.

362
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,435
- Sorry, sorry.
- Let's get one thing straight.

363
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:04,940
The only reason you're here and not doing
corporate PR for fucking DivaCups

364
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:06,734
is that I brought you here.

365
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:09,862
You are dispensable,
which means you answer to me.

366
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:11,280
Okay. Okay.

367
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:16,577
From now on, I will set my own agenda,

368
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,830
I'll approve my own marketing,
and I'll write my own talking points.

369
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:23,959
You will tell me everything
that goes on on the 99th floor.

370
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,961
And I mean everything.

371
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:27,963
Every call, e-mail, group chat.

372
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:31,467
If a fucking lightbulb goes out,
you will tell me.

373
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,511
And, Ashley...

374
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:39,141
...in no fucking way do you decide
who goes in The Seven.

375
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:41,935
I decide.

376
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:45,230
Do we have an understanding?

377
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:47,648
Yes.

378
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:55,073
<i>Translucent was laid to rest today</i>

379

388
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:09,022
You know how it is. Don't wanna
get stuck with the cleaning bill.

389
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:12,442
Uh-uh-uh.

390
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:16,822
Okay.

391
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:21,159
So, what's your poison? You a leg guy?

392
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:23,286
Uh...

393
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,122
An arm, please, actually.

394
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:28,166
Four hundred.

395
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:53,984
So do you want me to saw or chop or...?

396
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,485
Whatever floats your boat, tiger.

397
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:13,878
Oh, shit!

398
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,804
Holy shit! Holy shit!

399
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:25,182
Thank you! That was so...

400
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:27,184
I keep the arm, right?

401
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,020
Just keep it refrigerated.

402
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:38,528
For an extra grand,
I'll let you chop off my dick.

403
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,118
Where's the closest ATM?

404
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:07,724
- Hey!
- Hey! Hey!

405
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,352
- What the hell happened?
- Hey!

406
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:13,230
Holy shit. Sit him down!
Sit him down. Bring him over here.

407
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:25,825
Shit.

408
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:28,954
Listen, he's broken
every single bone in his arm.

409
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:31,832
Broken half his ribs. I can't do nothing.
Take him to the hospital.

410
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:33,166
Hospital.

411
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,752
Translate for me.
"Take him to the hospital."

412
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:40,715
Fuck!

413
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:45,636
Move, move.

414
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:00,776
Okay?

415
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:14,833
What'd he say? What's going on?

416
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:20,047
Frenchie, what'd he say?

417
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:32,828
- Cops seen this?
- No one's seen it.

418
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:34,746
I ain't trying to get life without parole.

419
00:32:39,835 --> 00:32:41,044
They promised me

420
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:44,756
they would only smuggle in guns
and cocaine and fentanyl.

421
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,925
- Not fucking...
- Not human fucking cargo?

422
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:49,511
- Jesus Christ, Frenchie.
- They didn't tell me.

423
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:50,929
Or you didn't ask.

424
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:13,535
A Supe.

425
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:16,705
A Supe terrorist.

426
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:23,295
They got paid
to smuggle in a Supe terrorist.

427
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:33,805
How about this one?
How does it make you feel? Anyone?

428
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:36,683
- I hate it.
- That's a strong reaction, Margaret.

429
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,351
I'd love to follow up on that.

430
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:41,188
What do you mean when you say
you hate the term "Super Terrorist"?

431
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:43,148
I just mean, it's really scary.

432
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:45,942
It makes me wanna lock the door
and hide under the bed.

433
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:48,195
Which means a double-digit drop
the opening weekend

434
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:49,446
of the Tek Knight movie.

435
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:52,616
I keep saying,
"Super Villain" is the better term.

436
00:33:56,328 --> 00:33:59,414
Jill, ask them what they think
about "Super Villain."

437
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:01,249
What about the term "Super Villain"?

438
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:04,419
That sounds better to me. More exciting.

439
00:34:04,502 --> 00:34:07,130
- More exotic.
- Okay.

440
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:14,721
Okay, turning our attention back to these,
which do you prefer?

441
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:17,599
"Saving America,"
can I get a show of hands?

442
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:20,518
Okay. How about "Saving the World"?

443
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:23,230
Wow. Unanimous, strong reaction.

444
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:26,816
- So, what is it about...?
- Nope. It's "Saving America."

445
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:28,984
Uh...

446
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:33,198
I don't know.
I feel like "Saving the World" has a...

447
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:42,832
It's Americans that are gonna keep us
in the Army, not the fucking world.

448
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,377
It's "Saving America."

449
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:47,503
Mm-hm.

450
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:49,881
Pull the trigger.

451
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:51,925
Great. Great.

452
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:08,524
Hey, man.

453
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:13,154
Thanks for letting me crash.

454
00:35:13,238 --> 00:35:16,950
Sorry, about the bathroom.
I'll clean it up.

455
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:19,202
No need to apologise.

456
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:24,248
Okay.

457
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:29,504
- Oh, shit. You scared me.
- Oh, that's just Carol.

458
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:30,672
Good friend.

459
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:34,551
Carol, this is The Deep.

460
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:37,470
I have been looking forward
to meeting you, Deep.

461
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:38,722
Would you like a Fresca?

462
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:42,433
Thank you.

463
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:48,023
Anyway, no need to apologise.

464
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:50,442
We've all been there. It's tough.

465
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,280
- Been where?
- Rock bottom.

466
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:57,699
I...

467
00:35:57,782 --> 00:35:59,743
I don't think I'm at rock bottom.

468
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:04,456
For me, my aha moment came

469
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:07,125
with a hostage situation at Kroger.

470
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,960
Multiple shooters.

471
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:13,882
I showed up, I'm letting arrows fly,
my aim is perfect.

472
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:16,508
But...

473
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:22,724
there's only so many arrows
a quiver can hold.

474
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:26,102
I just ran out.

475
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,270
And then...

476
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:32,233
we lost a lot of good people that day.

477
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,112
Then you start to question,

478
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:39,616
like, fucking arrows against TEC-9s?

479
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:43,828
- But?
- But I came to see

480
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:47,791
that archery isn't irrelevant,
it's timeless.

481
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:51,628
It's a pure and ancient art.

482
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:55,256
Carol helped me see that.

483
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,802
- What are you, his therapist or something?
- No.

484
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:03,098
No, therapy's very destructive, actually.

485
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:05,266
You could say I'm his teacher.

486
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,601
What about you, Deep?

487
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:10,605
What about...? What about me?

488
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,774
How did you end up here?

489
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,568
You can tell her, Deep.

490
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:19,406
Tell her what?

491
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:23,701
About your drinking.
About your self-esteem issues.

492
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:26,204
- Really open up, Deep.
- No, I don't...

493
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,748
I don't have a drinking... I'm fine.

494
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:32,419
- This is a safe space, Deep.
- If you don't have any self-esteem issues,

495
00:37:32,502 --> 00:37:34,879
why are you constantly demeaning women?

496
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:37,424
- That's a good question.
- Okay, thank you.

497
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:41,177
I don't know what the fuck this is,
but it's weird as fuck, so I'm leaving.

498
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:43,096
We just want to help.

499
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:45,974
- Carol really helped me, Deep.
- No, thank you.

500
00:37:46,057 --> 00:37:48,059
Help you get back into The Seven.

501
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:09,456
<i>Yesterday, The Deep was found
drunkenly ranting at children</i>

502
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:12,208
<i>at Splash Zone in Sandusky, Ohio.</i>

503
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:16,963
<i>He was later arrested and taken
to the Sandusky general detention centre.</i>

504
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:19,591
<i>He was released on bail shortly after.</i>

505
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:22,302
Did you make this?

506
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:34,898
You wrote something.

507
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:38,567
"Boy."

508
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:40,736
What boy?

509
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:44,115
I do not understand. What boy?

510
00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:54,124
Okay, so?

511
00:38:55,877 --> 00:38:57,837
They were wired the money
from a blind account

512
00:38:57,921 --> 00:38:59,464
to smuggle the bastard in.

513
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:03,384
- Cold trail.
- Amazing fucking friends of yours.

514
00:39:03,468 --> 00:39:08,223
I never said they were my friends, huh?
I only said we will be safe here.

515
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:14,187
- Okay, all right. What do we do?
- Oh, you just call 911.

516
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,897
What, an anonymous tip?

517
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,191
Yeah, I'm sure
that'll go straight to the mayor.

518
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:20,693
You saw that video.
What if he does that to an aeroplane?

519
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:22,612
Or the fucking Brooklyn Bridge?

520
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:24,656
So, what's your big plan, Hughie?

521
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:29,536
Okay, the CIA lady, right? Raynor?

522
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:30,619
Right.

523
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:36,376
The same CIA that wants to clamp our nuts
into some jumper cables.

524
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:37,835
We could call Butcher.

525
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:41,130
- For the last time, we don't need Butcher.
- Then what?

526
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:45,551
We should...

527
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:47,971
call Annie.

528
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:51,099
"Call Annie."

529
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:56,979
Annie?

530
00:39:58,648 --> 00:39:59,648
Yeah.

531
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,485
You mean Starlight?

532
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:05,488
'Cause that's who she is.

533
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:10,577
Vought has her phone so bugged,

534
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:13,580
they're praying that you do that.

535
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:18,375
Oh, no.

536
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:23,673
- You fucking called her?
- No, no. I'm not stupid, okay?

537
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,428
- I texted her.
- Oh, fuck.

538
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:30,763
And then we met up,
but we're getting some Compound V.

539
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:33,308
- Fuck you! Are you fucking crazy?
- M.M., easy!

540
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:35,935
- You crazy? What are you doing?
- We were careful!

541
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:38,021
- We used burner phones.
- Kid, you don't get it.

542
00:40:38,104 --> 00:40:41,691
They could've been following you.
They could be watching us right now!

543
00:40:44,402 --> 00:40:48,489
If you're the fucking reason
why I can't finish

544
00:40:48,573 --> 00:40:52,035
that Vermont country dollhouse,
I will fucking end you.

545
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:55,246
You've been walking around for days
like you wanna kick my ass,

546
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,664
so do it already.

547
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,755
Goddamn it.

548
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:07,300
Shit!

549
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:13,806
I don't want to kick your ass, Hughie.

550
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,601
I just don't want to get dragged
back into this shit, all right?

551
00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:21,731
I want to get home to my wife and my kid.

552
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,440
That's it.

553
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:25,860
If I still can.

554
00:41:28,404 --> 00:41:32,283
- This guy could kill a lot of people...
- Hughie, let somebody else handle it.

555
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:34,702
There's no one else!
No one's coming to save us.

556
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:35,787
You don't get it.

557
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:38,289
You are not a soldier.

558
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:40,208
You're not a spy.

559
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:44,921
- You're a kid that sells stereo equipment.
- No, I don't!

560
00:41:46,714 --> 00:41:48,174
I don't have a job.

561
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:51,302
Or Robin.

562
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,890
Or my dad. Or Annie.

563
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:00,144
One way or another, they all...

564
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:05,900
Now all I have is this.

565
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:11,197
This. Which is really
fucking depressing, but it's true.

566
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:16,244
So maybe I can't be Lee Marvin.

567
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:19,664
But I can be Harry Potter.

568
00:42:20,915 --> 00:42:23,418
Or, you know, John Connor

569
00:42:23,501 --> 00:42:26,671
or, what's her name
from <i>The Hunger Games?</i>

570
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:27,797
Katniss.

571
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:33,678
The point is, I could be that person
that nobody thinks is awesome,

572
00:42:33,761 --> 00:42:36,681
but it turns out
they're kind of fucking awesome.

573
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:42,145
M.M., listen, we help the CIA lady,

574
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:44,772
she could help you maybe
get back to your family.

575
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:46,774
Ever think of that?

576
00:42:51,487 --> 00:42:54,365
<i>- My baby needs a mother!
- Oy.</i>

577
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:57,160
<i>Shut your trap, you dumb bird.</i>

578
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,996
<i>Or else I'll bollocks you.</i>

579
00:43:00,747 --> 00:43:04,751
<i>But that's exactly
what William Butcher did.</i>

580
00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:08,796
Gecko?

581
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,630
Is that you?

582
00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:14,385
Starlight? Annie, hi.

583
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:16,387
- Hi.
- Oh, my God, hi.

584
00:43:18,431 --> 00:43:21,642
- Look at you, bigtime Seven hero.
- Oh, shut up.

585
00:43:21,726 --> 00:43:25,813
You know, I work in Vought Tower
at the labs on 67.

586
00:43:25,897 --> 00:43:27,523
Oh, you don't say.

587
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:30,526
I see your posters everywhere.
They're marketing the shit out of you.

588
00:43:31,944 --> 00:43:33,613
I'm happy for you, really.

589
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:36,240
Buy you some coffee?

590
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:39,911
Thank you.

591
00:43:39,912 --> 00:43:42,538
Yeah, at the Capes for Christ
Bible Camp, yes, totally.

592
00:43:42,622 --> 00:43:45,583
That Passion play we put on?
You were the best Jesus.

593
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:47,960
No one's gonna take a nail
through the hand like I can.

594
00:43:48,044 --> 00:43:50,546
And Big Game was Pontius Pilate.

595
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,049
Oh, my God, those freckles.

596
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:57,011
- You know he wanted to make out with me?
- Pontius Pilate and Mary hooking up?

597
00:43:57,094 --> 00:43:59,514
- Sacri-licious.
- Yeah, we never did.

598
00:43:59,597 --> 00:44:03,976
- Why not? He was so cute.
- Yeah, it was what Ezekiel always said.

599
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,228
And my mom too.

600
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:08,481
That God is watching over you,
every second.

601
00:44:09,357 --> 00:44:12,944
I thought that he was watching us,
and I thought that he'd be upset.

602
00:44:13,027 --> 00:44:16,113
Yeah, it's a messed up thing
to tell a kid.

603
00:44:16,197 --> 00:44:17,782
Yeah, but looking back?

604
00:44:19,408 --> 00:44:21,494
I should've made out with Big Game.

605
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:24,956
I should've done
a lot more stuff because...

606
00:44:26,082 --> 00:44:29,210
there is nothing up there.

607
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:33,381
There's nobody in the sky
watching over us.

608
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:38,594
Not God, not Homelander.

609
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:41,347
Not anybody.

610
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:44,934
It's all just...

611
00:44:45,977 --> 00:44:46,977
lies.

612
00:44:56,863 --> 00:44:58,322
I need a favour.

613
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:04,078
Yeah. Yeah, anything
for a Bible Camp alum.

614
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:15,256
I need you to go into the labs on 67
and steal me a sample of Compound V.

615
00:45:18,259 --> 00:45:19,427
Um...

616
00:45:20,887 --> 00:45:21,929
I, uh...

617
00:45:22,013 --> 00:45:23,848
I don't know what that is.

618
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:24,931
See?

619
00:45:25,975 --> 00:45:27,977
Another lie.

620
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,480
I know how we're made.

621
00:45:31,564 --> 00:45:33,816
And it is not Jesus.

622
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:40,531
I can't. I mean, it's impossible.
I'm a nobody there. I'm a lab rat.

623
00:45:40,615 --> 00:45:43,200
They cut off my limbs
and they grow back. I cannot get you...

624
00:45:43,284 --> 00:45:44,284
You have to.

625
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:46,913
Or I put this on Facebook tonight.

626
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,501
Gecko,

627
00:45:53,252 --> 00:45:57,006
former teen star
of Vought Summertime Clubhouse,

628
00:45:57,089 --> 00:45:59,550
working as an S&M hooker...

629
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,637
as a side hustle?

630
00:46:05,848 --> 00:46:08,392
I'm sure enquiring minds will wanna know.

631
00:46:09,477 --> 00:46:10,477
Annie?

632
00:46:11,562 --> 00:46:14,106
- I thought that we were friends.
- I'm sorry.

633
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:16,650
But...

634
00:46:17,026 --> 00:46:18,778
we're not anything.

635
00:46:29,163 --> 00:46:30,247
Hi.

636
00:46:30,331 --> 00:46:31,874
You know who we are.

637
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:34,126
But let's meet another hero.

638
00:46:34,835 --> 00:46:36,921
This is Lance Corporal Dan Miller.

639
00:46:37,505 --> 00:46:39,632
Dan and the other brave marines
of Second Battalion

640
00:46:39,715 --> 00:46:42,385
are helping keep you safe
from the Super Villain threat.

641
00:46:42,468 --> 00:46:44,720
We're proud to fly alongside them.

642
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:47,390
And now we could use your support.

643
00:46:47,473 --> 00:46:50,393
That's right, Maeve,
with our new campaign, Saving America.

644
00:46:50,476 --> 00:46:52,937
Here I go, you guys! Wish me luck.

645
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,606
Oh, FYI, not a real base.

646
00:46:56,357 --> 00:46:59,068
As if Homelander
and Maeve are gonna eat MREs

647
00:46:59,151 --> 00:47:01,195
and piss in a ditch
with the rest of the grunts.

648
00:47:01,278 --> 00:47:03,155
Yeah, hi, we're filming right now.
Excuse me?

649
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:05,658
You might recognise Army Boy
as Hotel Clerk 2

650
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:07,910
- from "The Devil's Breath"...
- Hello, excuse... Okay.

651
00:47:07,994 --> 00:47:09,954
...episode
of <i>Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders.</i>

652
00:47:10,037 --> 00:47:11,497
Well, hello!

653
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,416
Oh, my God, hi!

654
00:47:13,499 --> 00:47:16,168
My nana's your biggest fan.
I'm Stormfront.

655
00:47:16,252 --> 00:47:19,505
- Great.
- Oh, right, yeah. From Seattle, right?

656
00:47:19,588 --> 00:47:21,340
Uh...

657
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:25,720
Portland, actually, Your, uh... Highness.

658
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:30,182
Holy shit! Your eyes
are really fucking blue up close.

659
00:47:30,266 --> 00:47:33,978
You are fun.

660
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:37,148
It's been a hoot, but we got work to do,
so let's get back to it.

661
00:47:38,232 --> 00:47:41,402
Oh, totally.
They just wanted me to meet you.

662
00:47:41,986 --> 00:47:42,944
Who?

663
00:47:42,945 --> 00:47:45,115
Oh, the boys on 82.

664
00:47:45,197 --> 00:47:47,450
- I'm the new girl.
- Wait.

665
00:47:48,117 --> 00:47:49,744
- What are you talking about?
- Oh.

666
00:47:50,911 --> 00:47:52,788
Hi. I'm in The Seven.

667
00:47:53,664 --> 00:47:55,499
Replacing Translucent.

668
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,168
God bless his soul.

669
00:47:58,127 --> 00:48:02,089
Ink's barely dry
but, yeah, reporting for duty.

670
00:48:03,174 --> 00:48:04,300
Fuck, yeah!

671
00:48:04,383 --> 00:48:06,552
No, I don't think that this is...
It's not true.

672
00:48:06,635 --> 00:48:08,095
I don't know anything about this.

673
00:48:09,138 --> 00:48:13,434
Wow. Well, Stormfront?

674
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:17,021
Who delivered the good news?

675
00:48:17,646 --> 00:48:18,814
Oh, uh...

676
00:48:18,898 --> 00:48:21,734
Mr. Edgar, the big guy?

677
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:23,861
All right, back to one.

678
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:25,029
Wonderful.

679
00:48:25,613 --> 00:48:26,613
Great.

680
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:28,490
All right!

681
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:31,117
Great!

682
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:33,330
- Going again, people.
- Stand by.

683
00:48:33,412 --> 00:48:35,456
Well, I think this is going great.

684
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:43,756
You know, you ain't John Cusack, man.

685
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,217
You ain't got no motherfucking boom box.

686
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:49,470
- Sorry?
- You want to get back with Starlight.

687
00:48:49,553 --> 00:48:52,765
- No. No, I don't.
- Yes. Yes, you do.

688
00:48:52,848 --> 00:48:54,725
But this ain't the way to do it, Hughie.

689
00:48:54,809 --> 00:48:58,729
You can't keep pulling this shit, man.
Calling her, texting her.

690
00:48:58,813 --> 00:49:01,398
- Are you crazy?
- You sound like Butcher.

691
00:49:01,482 --> 00:49:03,359
- She's on our side.
- I know.

692
00:49:03,442 --> 00:49:06,862
I'm saying this for her, kid.
You're putting her in danger.

693
00:49:07,446 --> 00:49:10,074
Homelander finds out
that she's been talking to you?

694
00:49:10,157 --> 00:49:11,242
She's fucked.

695
00:49:12,034 --> 00:49:14,411
The deeper you keep pushing her
into this thing,

696
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,872
the deeper in the meat grinder she goes.

697
00:49:20,084 --> 00:49:21,460
How are you guys doing?

698
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:24,505
We're hanging in there.

699
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:26,924
- Has Butcher contacted you?
- Nope.

700
00:49:27,883 --> 00:49:29,552
He's completely ghosted.

701
00:49:31,095 --> 00:49:34,390
- Do you think he killed Madelyn Stillwell?
- I'd like to think that he didn't.

702
00:49:34,473 --> 00:49:37,601
But... I don't know.

703
00:49:39,937 --> 00:49:43,649
Deputy director, I know this might not be
the best time to ask, but do you ever...?

704
00:49:43,732 --> 00:49:45,109
Hear about your family?

705
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,280
Your daughter is starting soccer, I think.

706
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:52,491
Soccer?

707
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:56,369
Ma'am.

708
00:49:57,121 --> 00:49:58,497
Can M.M. see them?

709
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:02,293
You know what?
Let's see if this checks out.

710
00:50:02,376 --> 00:50:04,295
And I will see what I can do.

711
00:50:07,381 --> 00:50:08,591
Thank you, ma'am.

712
00:50:08,674 --> 00:50:10,843
Okay, so give me
the description of this guy.

713
00:50:10,926 --> 00:50:14,722
All right, about 5'10", 165,

714
00:50:14,805 --> 00:50:17,600
black hair,
wearing knockoff jeans and sneakers,

715
00:50:17,683 --> 00:50:20,769
probably from Taiwan, maybe India.

716
00:50:21,478 --> 00:50:23,147
You got all that from the video?

717
00:50:23,939 --> 00:50:27,151
So the other shoe drops
and it just crushes us all.

718
00:50:27,985 --> 00:50:28,985
Meaning?

719
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,990
Meaning, I've been trying
to put this puzzle together,

720
00:50:33,073 --> 00:50:35,492
and there's a missing piece
and it's been driving me nuts.

721
00:50:35,576 --> 00:50:38,913
- And I think you just handed it to me.
- Okay, so then what's the whole picture?

722
00:50:38,996 --> 00:50:40,831
The whole picture? It's Vought.

723
00:50:40,915 --> 00:50:45,169
- It's a fucking coup from the inside.
- Wait, what are you talking about?

724
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,841
Uh... ma'am, your nose.

725
00:50:54,762 --> 00:50:56,889
- Fuck! Let's get the fuck out of here!
- Holy shit!

726
00:50:56,972 --> 00:51:01,310
- Holy shit!
- Come on! Get in! Go, go, go!

727
00:51:02,269 --> 00:51:05,522
- Must be a Supe out there.
- Are our heads gonna explode?

728
00:51:05,606 --> 00:51:07,483
Frenchie, who do you know
who could do that?

729
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:09,777
- No one!
- Are our heads gonna explode?

730
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,445
<i>Look, I have a daughter.</i>

731
00:51:12,863 --> 00:51:15,449
<i>I'm worried about Super Terrorists too.</i>

732
00:51:16,992 --> 00:51:18,244
<i>But that does not mean</i>

733
00:51:18,327 --> 00:51:21,705
<i>that Vought can use that fear
to control us.</i>

734
00:51:21,789 --> 00:51:23,189
- Morning.
- Mr. Edgar, I'm sorry...

735
00:51:23,249 --> 00:51:25,793
- That's all right, Samantha.
- Busy day.

736
00:51:25,876 --> 00:51:27,086
Morning, Homelander.

737
00:51:27,795 --> 00:51:29,588
To what do I owe the pleasure?

738
00:51:29,672 --> 00:51:33,926
Well, you never come up to 99,
so figured I'd pay you a visit.

739
00:51:34,009 --> 00:51:36,095
- What a lovely idea.
- Right?

740
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:39,265
After all, you run a superhero company

741
00:51:39,348 --> 00:51:42,434
and you never check in
with your superheroes, do you?

742
00:51:43,644 --> 00:51:45,604
Like, oh, I don't know,

743
00:51:45,688 --> 00:51:48,107
around the hiring of that girl,
for example.

744
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:50,651
You wished to be consulted on Stormfront?

745
00:51:50,734 --> 00:51:51,944
Well, why not?

746
00:51:52,569 --> 00:51:54,571
I signed off on all the rest.

747
00:51:55,572 --> 00:51:56,865
I'm the leader of The Seven.

748
00:51:56,949 --> 00:52:00,202
- For which you have my undying respect.
- See, I don't think I do.

749
00:52:01,203 --> 00:52:02,203
No.

750
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:07,251
Not even Madelyn would've dared
to try and pull this kind of shit.

751
00:52:07,334 --> 00:52:10,379
Of course you know how important
you are to everyone at Vought.

752
00:52:10,462 --> 00:52:12,089
No, no. Stan.

753
00:52:12,923 --> 00:52:14,049
I am Vought.

754
00:52:16,135 --> 00:52:18,595
You show my photo
to some illiterate fucking camel jockey

755
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:19,888
in the middle of the Sahara,

756
00:52:19,972 --> 00:52:21,890
he's gonna turn around
and say, "Homelander,"

757
00:52:21,974 --> 00:52:23,267
in perfect American.

758
00:52:24,435 --> 00:52:25,435
You know what?

759
00:52:26,395 --> 00:52:28,939
My contract's up, end of this year.

760
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:36,363
Maybe it's time I move on.

761
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:41,076
How do you think
your shareholders would feel about that?

762
00:52:53,964 --> 00:52:56,342
What do you know about Frederick Vought?

763
00:52:58,802 --> 00:52:59,802
Excuse me?

764
00:53:00,929 --> 00:53:03,140
Frederick. Vought.

765
00:53:06,435 --> 00:53:08,145
Our esteemed founder.

766
00:53:10,105 --> 00:53:14,818
Well, I don't know, not a lot, probably.
I only read his autobiography...

767
00:53:14,902 --> 00:53:17,029
five times?

768
00:53:17,112 --> 00:53:18,822
Not the self-serving bullshit

769
00:53:18,906 --> 00:53:21,367
that we peddle to the shareholders,
the real story.

770
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:24,828
- Enlighten me.
- Got his doctorate from Munich.

771
00:53:24,912 --> 00:53:27,081
Ahead of his time in genetics.

772
00:53:27,164 --> 00:53:30,584
Such the rising young star that in '39,

773
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:33,212
Hitler appointed him
chief physician at Dachau,

774
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:36,340
where he enjoyed
a ready supply of human subjects

775
00:53:36,423 --> 00:53:39,134
on which to test
his earliest iterations of Compound V.

776
00:53:39,218 --> 00:53:43,389
For which we condemn
in the strongest of possible terms.

777
00:53:43,472 --> 00:53:46,100
Early in '44, he felt the winds change,

778
00:53:46,183 --> 00:53:48,394
got spirited away to the Allies.

779
00:53:48,477 --> 00:53:50,521
When Oppenheimer was flailing
with the bomb,

780
00:53:50,604 --> 00:53:54,233
Dr. Vought already had
practical applications of Compound V

781
00:53:54,316 --> 00:53:55,567
tested in the field.

782
00:53:56,151 --> 00:53:58,362
Heroes like Soldier Boy,

783
00:53:58,445 --> 00:54:00,364
killing Germans by the dozen.

784
00:54:01,156 --> 00:54:03,992
So Roosevelt pardoned him,

785
00:54:04,076 --> 00:54:06,703
and he became
as Wonder Bread American

786
00:54:07,704 --> 00:54:09,790
as Disney and Edison.

787
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:12,292
Well, this is a truly fascinating,

788
00:54:12,376 --> 00:54:15,838
if not slightly condescending lecture,
but, uh...

789
00:54:16,713 --> 00:54:18,257
I don't think I see the point, Stan.

790
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,550
The point is...

791
00:54:20,509 --> 00:54:24,430
that you are under a misconception
that we are a superhero company.

792
00:54:24,513 --> 00:54:25,514
We are not.

793
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:28,434
What we are, really,
is a pharmaceutical company.

794
00:54:28,517 --> 00:54:31,937
And you are not our most valuable asset.

795
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:35,649
That would be our confidential formula
for Compound V.

796
00:54:35,732 --> 00:54:39,194
Which you, man-child that you are,
released into the wild.

797
00:54:42,823 --> 00:54:46,201
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Let me remind you.

798
00:54:46,285 --> 00:54:48,745
You slipped Compound V
to terrorists all over the globe

799
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:51,415
to get you and your cronies
into national defence.

800
00:54:51,498 --> 00:54:54,209
But maybe at the cost of destroying
the whole company.

801
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:58,172
I don't think I appreciate your tone, sir.

802
00:54:59,298 --> 00:55:00,757
Not much at all.

803
00:55:00,841 --> 00:55:05,012
And I don't appreciate
that the FDA now knows about Compound V

804
00:55:05,095 --> 00:55:09,266
or that it's only a matter of time
before the public finds out.

805
00:55:09,892 --> 00:55:12,895
While you're preening
at the Golden Globes,

806
00:55:12,978 --> 00:55:17,316
we're busy, running around like maniacs,
trying to clean up the mess you made.

807
00:55:20,152 --> 00:55:25,449
I don't have to consult you
about Stormfront or anything else.

808
00:55:27,868 --> 00:55:33,749
Now, I believe you have a premiere
of <i>Tek Knight Lives</i> to go to?

809
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,378
What are you doing here?

810
00:56:21,713 --> 00:56:23,257
I've come to see my son.

811
00:56:40,774 --> 00:56:43,735
Fuck, Hughie. So glad you...

812
00:56:44,653 --> 00:56:45,988
got us into this shit.

813
00:56:46,655 --> 00:56:47,864
She had a husband.

814
00:56:48,907 --> 00:56:49,907
Right?

815
00:56:52,411 --> 00:56:53,537
A kid?

816
00:56:54,454 --> 00:56:56,665
Two kids.

817
00:56:59,167 --> 00:57:00,419
And I got her killed.

818
00:57:01,169 --> 00:57:02,713
You didn't get her killed.

819
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:05,591
That wasn't meant for us.

820
00:57:06,633 --> 00:57:08,051
How do you know?

821
00:57:08,135 --> 00:57:10,929
Because our brains aren't
all over the dash, that's how.

822
00:57:11,013 --> 00:57:12,806
Someone was watching her.

823
00:57:12,889 --> 00:57:16,101
And the minute she said something she
wasn't supposed to...

824
00:57:17,144 --> 00:57:18,520
Somebody from Vought?

825
00:57:20,439 --> 00:57:25,110
So we're saying
that Vought may have just assassinated

826
00:57:25,986 --> 00:57:27,988
the deputy director of the CIA.

827
00:57:28,071 --> 00:57:31,908
And now we're in the middle of that too.
Happy now, motherfucker?

828
00:57:44,963 --> 00:57:45,963
Hello?

829
00:57:46,757 --> 00:57:47,757
<i>It's me.</i>

830
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,803
- Jesus, you shouldn't be calling.
<i>- I'm on a burner phone, it's fine.</i>

831
00:57:51,887 --> 00:57:53,597
Yeah, but somebody could be listening.

832
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,599
Hughie, we did it.

833
00:57:55,682 --> 00:57:58,644
He's getting me the Compound V
in, like, a day or two.

834
00:57:58,727 --> 00:58:01,897
<i>What do you think?</i> New York Times?

835
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:05,275
<i>I mean, I was thinking CNN or MSNBC, but...</i>

836
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,194
Wait, just hold on a second.

837
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:09,946
Come on, this is
what we've been waiting for.

838
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:13,241
Let's burn those fuckers down.

839
00:58:14,451 --> 00:58:17,120
Just take a beat,
let's figure out the best way to do this.

840
00:58:17,204 --> 00:58:18,747
- Why? What happened?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

841
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:21,291
<i>Vought's just dangerous, that's all.</i>

842
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:24,002
<i>You gotta be careful.
I don't want you getting hurt.</i>

843
00:58:24,086 --> 00:58:25,086
I'm not gonna get...

844
00:58:27,631 --> 00:58:29,883
If something happened,
you know you can trust me.

845
00:58:29,966 --> 00:58:31,176
<i>We're in this together.</i>

846
00:58:32,177 --> 00:58:34,096
No, I do trust you. It's just...

847
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:38,016
I just want to take our time.
Do this right. That's all.

848
00:58:40,477 --> 00:58:43,480
I know when you're not
telling me the truth, Hughie.

849
00:58:43,563 --> 00:58:46,108
I kind of lived with it every single day.

850
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:50,987
Don't lie to me.

851
00:58:51,738 --> 00:58:52,739
Not again.

852
00:58:59,496 --> 00:59:00,496
I'm not.

853
00:59:02,374 --> 00:59:03,374
Swear to God.

854
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:13,385
Whatever. I... I gotta go.

855
00:59:42,622 --> 00:59:45,542
All right, easy does it, lads.
Easy does it.

856
00:59:47,294 --> 00:59:48,587
I tried to tell this cunt...

857
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:50,964
I'm with that lot.

858
00:59:51,047 --> 00:59:52,047
Yeah?

859
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:54,885
What the fuck are you wearing?

860
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,512
That is a good question.

861
00:59:58,430 --> 00:59:59,973
You called him?

862
01:00:00,682 --> 01:00:03,351
I'm sorry, Petit Hughie.
It's not a game now.

863
01:00:04,227 --> 01:00:05,645
We need a real captain.

864
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:09,357
Frenchie's right.

865
01:00:09,441 --> 01:00:11,693
This is a fucking mess, son.

866
01:00:11,777 --> 01:00:15,155
We got a Supe terrorist,
Raynor's blown her canister,

867
01:00:15,238 --> 01:00:17,616
and we're the most wanted cunts
in the country.

868
01:00:20,243 --> 01:00:21,578
But don't you worry.

869
01:00:24,164 --> 01:00:25,373
