{\an8}[Laura] <i>Jack Nelson's coming to London.</i>

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,080
{\an8}There are some people in this country
who I'd like to meet.

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,200
Fascists.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,120
Not the ones in boots and black shirts,
the ones in tuxedos.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,320
[Mosley] <i>Mr Shelby, Lady Diana Mitford.</i>

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,720
Oswald's most recent
and last ever mistress.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,760
Officially, he's coming
to buy liquor import licences.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,680
And unofficially, he's Roosevelt's envoy.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,400
By being among the fascists,
by being among them, I can undermine them.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,680
Still looking for trouble
big enough to kill you.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,440
If you don't want to help me
carry the bucket, I won't blame you.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,280
You have to carry this bucket on your own.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,800
Do we have a deal, Mr Nelson?

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,480
You're a brave man.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,560
Every war hero I ever met,

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,120
they're just someone
who wanted to get themselves killed.

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,080
-If anyone's going to kill Tommy Shelby...
-It will be you.

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,440
<i>The Devil will be dead.</i>

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,400
The future belongs to us.

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,200
[Lizzie] <i>You need to see a doctor.</i>

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,440
We got to keep going
till this Boston business is done.

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,200
[coughs]

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,360
-Hello?
-Tommy, she has a temperature of 101

24
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,520
and nothing is working.

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,480
Just get here now.

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,600
[laboured breathing]

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,280
Move away! Move away!

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,080
-No. Where's the doctor?
-[Lizzie] Can you get the doctor?

29
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,600
-I need to speak to a doctor.
-[doctor] Mr Shelby. Mr Shelby.

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,240
Your daughter has consumption.

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,080
Consumption is a very infectious disease.

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,000
There are procedures
that must be followed.

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,240
Please, hand over the child.

34
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,800
-[Lizzie] Okay. It's all right.
-[Tommy] Lizzie.

35
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,680
[Tommy] Right, you take her. Be gentle.

36
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,560
Look after her.

37
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,480
That's my daughter. Do you hear me?

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,920
I need to be with her.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,840
-[nurse] Stop.
-I need to be with my daughter!

40
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,000
[Lizzie] Tom.

41
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,360
[exhales] Okay. Come on.
They are X-raying Ruby,

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,480
they have to X-ray us.
We might have it as well.

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,040
Fuck us, Lizzie. Fuck us! Fuck you and me!

44
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,600
Who brought this on?

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,960
We've brought on this curse!

46
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,280
Stop, Tommy! Fucking stop!

47
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,680
[both panting]

48
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,400
They wouldn't let me pass.
They wouldn't let me pass.

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,720
-[Lizzie sighs]
-They did it on purpose.

50
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,760
To punish me.

51
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,400
Tommy, stop it, please.

52
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,920
All right.

53
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
[sighs] All right.

54
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,120
My husband is very sorry.

55
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,160
Okay.

56
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,040
My husband is very sorry
and he is calm now.

57
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,880
He's recovering from addiction.

58
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,800
Sometimes...

59
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,920
Sometimes...

60
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,520
he's a horse in a crate,
kicking the crate.

61
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,400
[breathes deeply]

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,120
It's just the crate I'm kicking.

63
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,560
-Lizzie.
-[Lizzie] Yeah?

65
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,440
Tell me what I have to do.

66
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,840
[nurse 2] This way, sir.

67
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,800
Sorry.

68
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,000
[Lizzie] Thank you.

69
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,360
[mechanical whirring]

70
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,760
[woman] Mr Shelby, you'll need
to keep still for a moment.

71
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,520
[equipment shifting]

72
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,360
[door slamming]

73
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,600
To see what's inside.

74
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,200
Wait till you see...

75
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,280
God.

76
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,720
[rapid clicking]

77
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,320
God knows what's inside.

78
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
God help her.

79
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,360
[footsteps approaching]

80
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,320
She has a tubercular infection
in her left lung.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,520
They've caught it quite early.

82
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,240
They'll do more tests.

83
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,360
They do this thing. "Pulmonary" something.

84
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,440
Where they collapse the lung, let it rest.

85
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,480
Sometimes the lung cures itself.

86
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,760
If that doesn't work, they use gold.

87
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,360
What?

88
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,600
Gold?

89
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,560
Yeah, gold salts.

90
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,080
Doctor said he explained
the methods to you

91
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,120
when you cut the ribbon
to open the institution.

92
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,400
Can't remember, I wasn't listening.

93
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,400
Yeah, well...

94
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,120
Gold salts.

95
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,520
Salt with 37% gold.

96
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,160
[sighs]

97
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,200
They say it helps,
but it will make her more sick at first.

98
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,600
Did they say... [exhales]

99
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,320
Did they say what the chances are?

100
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,240
No, they don't say.

101
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,200
[Tommy] Mmm.

102
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,080
But she's small.

103
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,680
And with TB, that's not good
because the disease is big and fast.

104
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,760
[sobbing]

105
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,360
I'm so sorry, my darling.

106
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,840
I will deal with it.

107
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,680
I will make it go away.

108
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,560
I will strike a bargain.

109
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
[door opens]

110
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,200
[Lizzie] You should be wearing a mask.

111
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,040
I am.

112
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,160
[kisses]

113
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,640
You can try gold.

114
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,120
I will try something else.

115
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,000
[telephone dials]

116
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,640
[Tommy] Mayfair, 244.

117
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,080
Ada? Listen to me.
I need you to be me in London.

118
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,320
No, it's important.

119
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,760
I know you want nothing
to do with my business.

120
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,720
But Ruby is very sick.

121
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,240
I need five days of your time.

122
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,480
[telephone drops]

123
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,320
So she dresses well.

124
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,320
Go to the door and take her coat.

125
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,640
-[man] Yes, ma'am.
-Uh...

126
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,600
And make a note of the label.

127
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,880
[man] Of course, ma'am.

128
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,520
Oh, Thomas, where the devil are you?

129

[lever clicks]

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,600
[knock on door]

133
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,120
Mrs Ada Thorne, ma'am.

134
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,120
I thought you were all called Shelby.

135
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,320
I'm a widow.

136
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,800
My husband didn't have
the good grace to die.

137
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,240
He lingers yet.

138
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,040
Your husband's a member
of the Guinness family, I believe.

139
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,440
They do a lot of good work
on behalf of the poor.

140
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,720
The poor who are only poor

141
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,320
because they spent so much
of their income on Guinness.

142
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,360
Please.

143
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,880
I think the causes of poverty
are a little more complex than that.

144
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,320
Yes, I believe it is to do with genetics.

145
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,440
Huh. Beautiful vase.

146
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,280
My grandfather stole it
from a brothel in Cairo.

147
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,560
Egyptian. 18th dynasty, I think.

148
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,880
How do you know
so much about Egyptian vases?

149
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
-I collect antiques.
-Hmm.

150
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,440
A tribe of Gypsies
settles on a clearing in a factory town.

151
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,280
Children, of course,
ensue in their hundreds,

152
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,240
but one of them
becomes a gangster and a politician.

153
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,360
The other a collector of antiques.
It is quite extraordinary.

154
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,240
A result of genetics, I think.

155
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,680
My dear, you researched me
and I researched you.

156
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,880
If this was 1919,
you would have come through my front door

157
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,680
carrying a revolver and a Molotov cocktail
and would happily have blown off my head.

158
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,960
[chuckles] Isn't it wonderful how time
changes everything? Where is the American?

159
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,680
-He'll be here later.
-Where's Mosley?

160
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,040
He heard Thomas wasn't coming
so he decided to sulk. You know men.

161
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,040
Where is Thomas?

162
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,520
His daughter is sick.

163
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,800
Does he not employ a governess?

164
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,480
Hmm. It's a class thing. A genetic thing.

165
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,040
He puts his daughter's welfare
before business.

166
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,960
Even the business of changing the world?

167
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,920
I thought today was purely social.

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,120
Now that it's just you,
I suppose it will be.

169
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
[laughs]

170
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,840
[Diana chuckles]

171
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,360
You should know
your brother has altered my life.

172
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,480
The men here just bounce up and down
in their saddles in a rising trot,

173
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,840
never even galloping.

174
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,920
Thomas is the man
on the horse on the vase.

175
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,680
That's why I put it out
for you to look at.

176
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,240
According to recent interpretations,
the black rider on 18th-dynasty vases

177
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,800
is meant to signify approaching death.

178
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,480
So, yes, I suppose it resembles Thomas.

179
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,240
Tell me, why is he
so emotionally mutilated?

180
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,240
Well, because he's a character
in a novel, of course.

181
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,760
One of those novels
ladies like you like to read.

182
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,520
All about wild men.

183
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,800
[scoffs] Well, I don't read novels.

184
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,240
I read only pornography and politics.

185
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,560
In the absence of the men, shouldn't
we ladies be engaging in small talk?

186
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,080
Very well. Small talk.

187
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,440
[inhales deeply]

188
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,240
You know, I like
to fuck women as well as men.

189
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,840
[chuckles]

190
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,320
Tommy was right.

191
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,040
He says that everything is a circle.

192
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,600
A lady in Eaton Square
as coarse and honest as an Aston whore.

193
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,120
Just realised I haven't even
offered you a drink.

194
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,960
[bottle clinks]

195
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,360
Ada, before the dreary business
of changing the world begins,

196
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,960
I want you to know something.

197
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,440
When the time comes
for the great cleansing,

198
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,760
I myself will personally argue the case

199
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,560
that the Jews must be dealt with,
but that the Gypsies should be spared.

200
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,560
[scoffs]

201
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,840
Let's drink whiskey
and wait for the American.

202
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,480
[both chuckle]

203
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,760
[gravel crunches]

204
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,560
[dogs barking]

205
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,960
Who the fuck are you?

206
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,160
I am the owner of this Colt pistol

207
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,160
and the bullets within it.

208
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,360
And I'm in a hurry.

209
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,040
I followed the patrin signs
of the Lee family.

210
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,640
I'm looking for Esme Shelby-Lee.

211
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,120
Never heard of her.

212
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,520
[in Romani] She is my brother's widow.

213
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,440
I am very anxious to speak to her.

214
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,280
[in English] Esme's husband was
a fucking dirty didicoy.

215
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,360
He was a Peaky Blinder.

216
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,320
[Tommy] Yeah?

217
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,960
Well, I am the elder and more terrible.

218
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,240
And as I said, I'm in a hurry.

219
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,880
Where is she?

220
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,080
Put your gun away, Thomas.
There's children around.

221
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,840
You only found me
'cause I let you find me.

222
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,080
I heard you were looking. And I'm curious.

223
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,080
If any of these men is your man,

224
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,160
please tell him I want no trouble.

225
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,560
[Esme] I don't have a man.

226
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,960
What use is a man?

227
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,640
Horse pulls the wagon.

228
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,520
Dog keeps me safe.

229
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,000
Cat keeps me warm at night.

230
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,320
And if anyone's gonna
give you trouble, Tommy Shelby,

231
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,880
it'll be me.

232
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,520
What do you want?

233
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,120
Tell 'em to leave.

234
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,680
What, you think I'm in charge here?

235
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,320
Oh, I'm sure of it, Esme.

236
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,440
[in Romani] Leave.

237
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,640
The poor boy is scared.

238
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,200
[dogs barking]

239
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,600
[horse neighing]

240
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,960
[in English] Didicoy's too grand
to put his arse on the grass these days?

241
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,160
I have a daughter, Esme.

242
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,800
Her name is Ruby.

243
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,359
She's fallen ill, suddenly.

244
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,319
She's very sick.

245
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,680
And I can tell, by saying her name
and looking in your eyes,

246
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,880
that I've wasted petrol, time and hope.

247
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,960
[Esme] Wasted petrol on what?

248
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,320
Oh!

249
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,240
Tommy Shelby, OBE, MP,

250
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,440
running around the mountains
in pursuit of a Gypsy curse, is that it?

251
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,600
I thought you had
Polly deal with the spirits.

252
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,840
Polly is dead.

253
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,840
Bullet or blade?

254
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,520
Still speaks to me in my dreams.

255
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,760
It was her who told me to come find you.

256
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,600
Polly.

257
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,240
[scoffs]

258
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,800
That name, like the ringing
of a school bell.

259
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,520
"Come and do as you're told."

260
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,760
Fuck.

261
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,360
So glad I'm not in your camp any more.

262
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,400
Made of bricks and bars.

263
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,440
[Tommy] My daughter is dying, Esme.

264
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,120
Some people go to France.

265
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,800
To Lourdes. I hear they sell trinkets.
I need more than fucking trinkets.

266
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,400
I can tell from your reaction,
this is not your doing.

267
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,520
Sorry for troubling you.

268
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
[clock ticking]

269
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
[door opens]

270
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,160
The butler says
our American friend is parking the car.

271
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,760
He also says,
in answer to your inquiry, Diana,

272
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,520
that the coat our exotic friend
is wearing is made by Chanel.

273
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,800
That's a very expensive label.

274
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,920
Yes, it is.

275
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,400
But the perfume
I can smell on you is very cheap.

276
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,320
[Mosley clears throat]

277
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,880
I'm deeply, deeply annoyed
that Thomas isn't here.

278
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,720
[Diana] It is a family emergency,
apparently.

279
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,000
We only have Ada, the sister.

280
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,360
Well, would the sister
like some more champagne?

281
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,080
-The sister is allowed to speak?
-She thinks this lunch is purely social.

282
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
[laughs]

283
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,160
The sister is here
because there's sickness in the family.

284
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,480
Thomas wanted someone
from the Shelby organisation

285
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
to introduce Mr Nelson to you,

286
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,840
and to offer
all three of you an invitation.

287
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,640
Ooh.

288
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
What invitation?

289
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,600
[Ada] The invitation can wait.

290
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,640
And please remember that
in this moment, in this room,

291
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,120
it is the Shelby family
that holds the power

292
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,840
because we have the information
and the incentives

293
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,280
that will make Mr Nelson
do what you require him to do.

294
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,640
So when I speak,
please keep your fucking mouths closed.

295
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,560
Because although I'm reluctant,
I am actually quite good at this.

296
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,720
And, yes, I will have champagne.

297
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,880
-[Gina chuckles]
-[Mosley] Ah!

298
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,960
Take care of this.

299
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,120
Okay, so before these
dull introductions begin,

300
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,480
I just have to tell you something
that my niece, Gina, just told me.

301
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,400
[Gina] No, Jack...

302
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,840
She said the Shelby family

303
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,320
are all witches and sorcerers
who speak freely with the dead. So...

304
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,400
who here is a Shelby?

305
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
-[Ada clears throat]
-Is it true?

306
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,600
-[Ada] Gina.
-Hello, Ada.

307
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,200
Michael sends his regards.

308
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,960
You're the sister.

309
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,520
Yes, it seems I am, indeed, the sister.

310
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,920
[Nelson] I did some research.

311
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,160
You were a communist once,
but diamonds and lipstick now?

312
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,640
Actually, I'm a socialist.

313
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,680
She's Mr Shelby's political advisor.

314
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,200
And you're the future prime minister
of Great Britain and its dominions.

315
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,200
Indeed, I am.

316
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,400
And you, Lady Diana Mitford.

317
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,160
Talk of London,
with her amphetamines and emeralds.

318
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,720
[laughs]

319
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,600
It's her sharp mind that I'm in love with.

320
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,920
Men bore me.

321
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,200
Ada, do you have a man?

322
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,400
My husband died.
But, of course, we speak often.

323
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,720
Between this sparkling conversation,
could I get a drink of some kind?

324
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,760
So this little kid, Gina, she runs out,
she marries a gangster,

325
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,880
and now here we all are.

326
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,120
Oh, Jack, please. You're so blunt.

327
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,600
Yes, it's wonderful.
A man who is not careful with his words.

328
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,720
I'm not careful.

329
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,040
Just say it first and then clear up
the broken glass with my bare hands.

330
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,360
[Mosley] Here you are.

331
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,000
I don't seem to have a drink either.

332
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,480
Well, I have Scotch or Irish.

333
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,720
Thomas drinks Irish.

334
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,880
Where the hell is he?

335
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,400
Irish.

336
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,400
-He's been unavoidably detained.
-Nothing is unavoidable.

337
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,920
[Mosley] His daughter is unwell.

338
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,280
He doesn't have a wife?

339

[bottle clinks]

340
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,040
You know, I did some research
on you too, Mr Nelson.

341
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,040
Ada here is the smart one of the family.

342
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,720
When you were young, you lost
a brother and a sister to consumption.

343
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,280
No ice?

344
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,080
Well that same awful illness
has entered our family.

345
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,760
And Thomas has very little faith
in current medical practices

346
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,440
regarding tuberculosis.

347
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,880
Man, he has that right.

348
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,520
He's gone off in search of alternative
approaches to curing the disease.

349
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,760
Experimental work that he hopes
will save the life of his daughter.

350
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,000
[Nelson] In his shoes,
I would do the same thing.

351
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,440
Your brother intrigues me.

352
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,520
Yes, he often has that effect on people.

353
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,680
Yes, and my future husband has that effect
on 20 million people in this country,

354
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,440
who attend his rallies
and listen to his broadcasts.

355
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,760
[Nelson] It's amazing...

356
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,760
what English upper-class women can do
with just skin, bone and arrogance.

357
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,760
[Ada] My brother sends his apologies
for not being here

358
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,960
and would like to invite all of you
to his home for a meeting.

359
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,040
A meeting where
the real business will be done.

360
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,280
And where you can meet
like minds from Ireland.

361
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,840
Who'd also like to discuss
the future of Europe.

362
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,840
But as you say,
this lunch is purely social.

363
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,200
And looking at my glass,
I see I still don't have champagne.

364
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,920
Michael told me
the sister had gone straight.

365
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,920
Yes, but her brother is the Sun.

366
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,760
The rest just orbit around him.

367
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,240
Gina tells me lots of things,
but I want to hear it from you, Ada.

368
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,800
What exactly does
the Shelby Company Limited do?

You used to have eyes
in the back of your head.

How can you change so much
and not change at all?

376
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,200
I have other lines of inquiry.
Give me the spark plug. Give me the...

Give me the fucking spark plug.

Give you the spark, give you hope,
is that what you want?

[Esme scoffs]

about this matter.

[in English] Something you should see.

Someone grieving.

384
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,080
A lot of hate against you.

385
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,480
You were wise to come to me, Thomas.

386

Open the bonnet, would you?

387
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,280
What hate?

388
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,760
What hate? What grieving?

389
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,600
I can't explain
where it is you have to go.

So I'll take you there.

I hope the suspension's good.

Do you know where he's gone?

He's gone up a mountain,
looking for a miracle.

Mr Shelby doesn't allow whiskey
in the building any more.

Then have someone go and fetch some.

Until Mr Shelby comes down

We locked him in the cash safe.

When he gets the yamps really bad,
he tells us to lock him in the safe.

Stop him from slipping down to China Town.

What are "the yamps"?

Arthur gets the yamps a lot?

A lot is twice a day.

Arthur gets them three times a day.

But everybody said
I would be wasted counting money.

Instead of stealing it.

Ten days clean, I'm gonna take him
into a warehouse full of fucking opium?

Can be your job to look after him.

Why take him at all?

It's his reputation you're taking.

The beating can be conducted
in a civilised way.

No one would dare fuck with Arthur Shelby.

But they would fuck with me?

Yes.

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,960
[door closes]

486
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,720
[keys clatter]

487
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,200
Lock the door, Lizzie.

488
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,960
There are people around here who start
drinking this early in the morning.

489
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,920
No.

490
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,680
Need to stay myself. [sighs]

491
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,360
-Be strong.
-No. Come on. Not with me.

492
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,800
You can let it go with me.

493
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,640
I can't cry, Ada.
If I start, I'll fall apart.

494
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,720
I need to stay strong for Ruby.

495
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,240
Tommy says it's just in one lung.

496
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,800
[sighs] No.

497
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,600
They now think it's in both.
It's moving quickly.

498
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,680
They collapsed the left lung,
but it made no difference.

499
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,480
Starting her on the gold salts tomorrow.

500
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,840
You know somebody who died
on the gold treatment, yes?

501
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,800
Half the people I tell
look like you just did

502
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,720
because they know someone
who died on the gold treatment.

503
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,120
The person I knew was old.

504
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,560
Old and young, the same.

505
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,800
You've given up, Lizzie?

506
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,840
[swallows loudly]

507
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
No.

508
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,920
I'm being strong.

509
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,360
At her bedside, on my own.

510
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,840
While Tommy is up in the mountains
to be among the Gypsies.

511
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,440
In truth, it's a blessing
he's not around at the hospital.

512
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,080
Because all he wants to do
is fight people and blame himself.

513
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,600
And I've never felt so ashamed of him.
Christ, 'cause right now, I...

514
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,360
I need a normal man.

515
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,840
It's me sitting there,
taking away the bloody rags

516
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,320
and watching her disappear.

517
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,679
Do you know when he's back, Ada?

518
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,320
He gave me instructions, not information.

519
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,320
[exhales]

520
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,080
Can you get a message to him?

521
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,239
He'll be out of reach.

522
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Ada, I thought you might know things.

523
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,120
[sighs] I've been away from all this.

524
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:03,200
You're still Gypsy.

525
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,280
Yeah, well, the mystery leaves you.

526
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,320
What mystery?

527
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,720
Lizzie, is there anything practical
that I can do?

528
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,800
Before he left,
he was looking for a number for Esme.

529
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,560
[scoffs] What's Esme got to do with this?

530
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,520
I thought you might know.

531
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,760
Esme's a Lee.

532
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,400
What does that mean?

533
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,720
The Lees and the Barwells,
they're wild tribes.

534
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,040
Where do they live?

535
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,200
They're Gypsies.

536
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,360
-They live where they like.
-Fuck.

537
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,280
Fuck, Ada...

538
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,640
[scoffs and sighs]

539
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,360
Tribes in the mountains.

540
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,040
It's 1934, and the doctors
know what it is.

541
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,400
They know what causes it.
But no, my husband, he knows better.

542
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,720
Not a normal man, your brother.

543
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,040
He's up in the mountains
with fucking horse thieves and sorcerers,

544
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,480
while I'm here on my own.

545
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,600
Not a normal man.

546
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,800
[Lizzie sighs]

547
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,640
[door opens]

548
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,440
[door closes]

549
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,360
It's okay, Arthur. I'll look after you.

550
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,320
Yeah.

551
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,960
And Ada said it'd be okay
if I recruited my cousins.

552
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,920
Off the streets of Alum Rock
and looking for the big time.

553
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,360
What do you say, Arthur?

554
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,560
[sighs]

555
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,480
I say big-time boys
don't ask for permission.

556
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,360
I think he means you're in.

557
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,120
Let's go.

558
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,200
Can you still ride bareback?

559
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,200
[car engine stops]

560
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,360
[car door closes]

561
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,360
[knife slices]

562
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,720
[horse neighs]

563
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,120
[Tommy] We're a long way
from anywhere, Esme.

564
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,920
I find out you've been wasting my time,
I'll use that rope to fucking hang you.

565
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,640
Right, hold up. Hold on. Hold on.

566
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,280
Listen, you know what you gotta do, right?

567
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,280
You've got your orders.

568
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,680
I'm depending on you.

569
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
You hear me?

570
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,960
And let me tell you something.

571
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,000
Any man...

572
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,440
Any fucking man
who looked like this before

573
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,760
are Peaky Blinder.

574
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,720
A Peaky Blinder still looks like this...

575
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,400
after.

576
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,680
Let's go.

577
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,560
We are here to meet a gentleman
called Haydn Stagg.

578
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,480
[man] A gentleman?

579
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,640
Mr Stagg?

580
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,280
That scoundrel.

581
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,440
Never there when you need him.

582
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,520
Who needs him?

583
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,000
We do.

584
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,560
Where is he?

585
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,320
The last I saw, he was

586
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,760
up to his balls in a lady called Maria.

587
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,960
[all laughing]

588
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,080
[man groans]

589
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,640
[Isiah] No time for tradition
or the rules of the sporting life

590
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,040
because, among the Peaky Blinders,

591
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,720
any man who comes home
from a mission with all his bullets,

592
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,560
he pays a fine.

593
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,600
My name's Haydn Stagg.

594
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,440
I hear there's some men here
from Birmingham looking for me.

595
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,760
I was in the banana warehouse
playing football with the boys.

596
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,280
I'm guessing you gentlemen
aren't here to kick footballs.

597
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,800
No.

598
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,880
We're here about other business.

599
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,000
We like to call it "Black Star" business.

600
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,520
Black Star a pub, is it?

601
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,760
Black Star...

602
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,600
Yeah, Black Star is a pub.

603
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,280
Last pub you ever fucking drink in.

604
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,240
Peaky Blinders take you to the Black Star,
and all your troubles are done.

605
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,960
But the pub you drink in, Mr Stagg,

606
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,200
is called The Dolphin, right?

607
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,520
Every night... [sniffs]

608
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,560
...you're in there.

609
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,480
Not to drink.

610
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,120
You're there divvying up
the day's takings, ain't you?

611
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,760
And there's a woman there.

612
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,960
She sings out, "Opium for sale!"

613
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,960
[guns cock]

614
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,200
Sit down, boys.

615
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,920
[gun cocks]

616
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,000
The rules say the king puts his head
on the block and the game is up.

617
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,600
You're stealing
from the Shelby Company Limited.

618
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,480
You're stealing
from the Peaky Blinders, man.

619
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,560
Therefore...

620
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,560
punishment

621
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,120
is a visit to the Black Star pub.

622
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,560
Hmm?

623
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,720
But out of kindness,

624
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,080
of my heart,

625
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,240
your sentence has been commuted.

626
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,120
Praise the fucking Lord!

627
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,000
And our lovely Ada, eh?

628
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,920
Instead...

629
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,000
Instead, Mr Haydn Stagg,
it's just a beating for you.

630
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,120
Well, before I take this beating...

631
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,960
Arthur Shelby, is it, yeah?

632
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,800
You know, comrade,
beneath your sleeves lies the truth.

633
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,040
The marks on your arm.

634
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,400
Yeah.

635
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,480
The stories about you come up the canal.

636
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,760
You know, where once
you walked fine alone,

637
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,640
now you need a stick.

638
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,520
[Isiah] Let's just fucking do it, Arthur.

639
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,400
[scoffs]

640
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,520
You know, for me, it was the morphine
they gave us in France.

641
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,640
I got a taste for it, Arthur.

642
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,040
1924 before I realised
the fucking war was over.

643
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,280
There's a warehouse
full of it just across the yard there.

644
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,400
Where the boys play football.

645
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,840
And they steal it.
Just roll around laughing.

646
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,440
And it floats in the air.

647
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,440
But I'm strong, comrade.

648
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,080
Arthur, let's just fucking do it.

649
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,560
Liar.

650
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,120
It's me that's due a beating.

651
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,000
But it's me who feels sorry
for you, Mr Shelby,

652
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,440
because you take your beating
every hour of every day.

653
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,800
Your own blood betrays you
because it demands dilution.

654
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,000
Sometimes you want
to cut a doorway in your arm

655
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,360
so your blood can escape
and leave you in blessed peace.

656
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,240
-[Arthur inhales deeply]
-[Haydn] Yeah.

657
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,040
Fuck you, man.

658
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,440
I was once where you are now, Arthur.

659
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,760
[Arthur sobs]

660
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,560
If you're gonna do it, do it.

661
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,000
But look at me as the man you can be.

662
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,080
You've tried Jesus, yeah?

663
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,280
Yeah, he looked you up and down
and he shook his head.

664
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,360
Your loved ones.

665
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,800
Your wife.

666
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,200
Your kids.

667
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:48,000
Jesus and your wife
and your kids can't help you.

668
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,040
Only you, Arthur Shelby.

669
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,440
Only you.

670
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,080
Don't count the days.

671
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,560
Futile.

672
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,720
You get to a hundred and then you wake up
and it's fucking one again.

673
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,080
[sniffs]

674
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,600
No, don't build mountains.

675
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,960
Walk like it's a flat plain.

676
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,840
Easy step by easy step.

677
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,200
Arthur, just give me the fucking word
and I'll fucking do it!

678
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,600
He's your stick, Arthur.
Give him the order.

679
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,680
[Isiah] Arthur, I'm not gonna
ask you fucking twice!

680
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,560
Isiah, leave him alone.

681
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,160
[Isiah] No. No fucking way.

682
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,080
Leave him alone.

683
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,480
Isiah, I said you can stand down!

684
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,600
Enough, let's go. Come on.
Come on, all of you!

685
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,560
Go on! Go on!

686
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,800
Gypsy graveyard.

687
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,760
You can still read the signs.

688
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,800
No horse will go beyond here,
we'll have to walk.

689
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,960
Tell me whose grave it is.

690
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,040
You'll see.

691
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,280
Who knows what you'll see?

692
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,120
Do you ever go to John's grave?

693
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,600
When things are really bad.

694
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,880
Well what's really bad?

695
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,080
I've done bad things, Esme.

696
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,160
You think now
you're being punished for them?

697
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,600
I would like to make amends.

698
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,680
You want to lift every curse
anyone's ever put on you.

699
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,440
That's a lot of lifting.

700
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,760
-My own curse is in there somewhere.
-I should've done more to protect John.

701
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,880
Think in this holy place, the spirits
are listening to you being kind?

702
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,520
Believe it or not, Esme,
I'm discovering kindness.

703
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,280
I'm learning it from my children.

704
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,200
[chuckles]

705
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:42,000
-Do you ever think you've lost your mind?
-I lost it long ago.

706
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,160
I only use the crate it came in.

707
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,280
I know why you're here.

708
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,280
I'm in a hurry, Esme.

709
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,480
Think you can make a deal even with death?

710
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,280
Well soon you'll be
in the right place to do it.

711
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:58,000
The village disappeared. Church fell down.
Only us still use the graveyard.

712
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,200
[decorations rattling]

713
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,200
Do you recall a sapphire?

714
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,040
You gave a sapphire to a woman
called Bethany Barwell.

715
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,720
Ten years ago.

716
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,800
She took the stone back to her camp.

717
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,120
I warned her about it,
but she took it anyway.

718
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,600
[Esme] She gave the sapphire
to her sister, Evadne Barwell.

719
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,440
Evadne put the stone
around the neck of her daughter.

720
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,960
Little girl.

721
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,640
Straight away,
the little girl began to cough.

722
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,720
She died that night.

723
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,840
Seven years old.

724
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,800
I heard they threw
the sapphire in the river.

725
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,360
No one's ever gone to look for it.

726
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,640
I'm guessing it's the girl's mother
who laid the curse.

727
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,160
Only women can lay curses.

728
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,640
Perhaps she waited
till your little girl was seven.

729
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,320
So you'd know how it feels.

730
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,520
-[Tommy] Do you have whiskey?
-[Esme] No.

731
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,720
[Esme] Tommy.

732
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,040
Perhaps the treatment will work
and your daughter will live.

733
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,080
Science.

734
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,640
Science is winning everything these days.

735
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,520
Even against the angels.

736
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,440
I can leave you if you want.

737
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,280
Your horse will know its way back.

738
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,680
But I think there should be
some reward for what I've shown you.

739
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,760
Some consideration.
You can afford it, Mr Shelby, OBE.

740
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,080
I will find her.

741
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,960
I will find this fucking Evadne Barwell.

742
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,480
I will fucking find her.

743
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,600
I'll give her money
to take back this curse.

744
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,680
You only found me
'cause I wanted to be found.

745
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,600
The Barwells
roam from the border to the sea.

746
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,920
I will give her £10,000. More, anything.

747
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,440
You will put out word, Esme.

748
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,160
You will put out word,
I will put out word, I will find her.

749
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,920
And instead of this poor wooden cross...

750
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,840
[Esme] Tommy!

751
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,840
...I will build a monument
to this little girl.

752
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,200
Her mother can decide how big.

753
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,000
It can be as big
as fucking Nelson's Column.

754
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,320
That and £10,000.

755
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,800
I will buy her off.

756
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,600
I will start looking today.

757
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,120
Ruby will be well!

758
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,680
She will be well!

759
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,800
And I will undo
the many wrongs that I have done.

760
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,040
Now that I'm without whiskey,
I can hear the spirits clearly.

761
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,320
They're saying Ruby will be well
if I make amends.

762
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,480
That is the conversation.

763
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,520
If you want my help,
I will help you, Thomas. If you pay me.

764
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,560
Pay me and I'll help you to find her.

765
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,080
-I will pay you.
-But I don't want money.

766
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,600
I don't read the papers,
but I know there was a crash.

767
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,040
Nothing is certain and money loses value.

768
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,040
Instead of money, give me gold.

769
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,880
[panting] Gold. Yes, I will give you gold.

770
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,440
[Esme] In uncertain times,
gold is always certain.

771
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,640
[Tommy] I will give you gold.

772
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,600
And you will help me find this woman
and she will spare my daughter.

773
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,040
[thunder rumbles]

774
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,720
[car approaches]

775
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,520
-[Tommy] Lizzie!
-Where the fuck were you?

776
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,840
Where were you?!

777
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,080
Where the fuck were you?!

778
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,040
She's gone, Tommy. [sobs]

779
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,000
She's gone.

780
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,480
Just now. 5:17.

781
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,800
You weren't fucking near here.

782
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,440
Were you? Were you?

783
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,600
[breathing heavily]

784
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,680
It was before then and she was here,
and then she was gone.

785
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,000
Now she's gone
to where they've put the dead.

786
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,800
They've put her with the dead people.

787
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:34,960
[Lizzie sobs]

788
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,680
She was asking just now for you.

789
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,160
But went...

790
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,240
5:17.

791
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,360
I told her that you love... [sobs]

792
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,600
I gave her your kiss goodbye.

793
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,840
[sobs softly]
