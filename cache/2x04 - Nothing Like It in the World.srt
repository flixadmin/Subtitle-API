1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,880
Federal authorities have
initiated a manhunt for William Butcher.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,090
It's Vought.
It's a fucking coup from the inside.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,880
I know who killed Raynor.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,510
Something to do with the Supe terrorist
smuggled into Jersey.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,720
Her brother.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,560
I just want me wife back.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,970
Bring Langley the terrorist
and you'll have her.

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,190
I was told he would never know
about Ryan or me, that was the deal.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,690
You need to make him leave.

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,820
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna take Ryan and I'm gonna run.

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,570
Superheroes are not born
but made by Compound V.

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,450
We got a Supe terrorist below deck,
and shit could go sideways just like...

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,330
Fucking diabolical!

14
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,010
I said he was mine.

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,180
You snooze, you lose, gramps.

16
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,060
Our newest hero, Stormfront,
stopped the terrorist before

17
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,600
he could take more innocent lives.

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,620
Improved by KID 

Resynced by KID 

Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,440
Communication is everything.

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,270
Steve and I had been dating for two years
when he asked me to marry him.

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,400
At the rehearsal dinner,

22
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,900
my dad said we should look
into a 529 account for our kids.

23
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,950
Steve laughed and said that was nuts,
and that we were never having kids.

24
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,950
Which was news to me. Yeah.

25
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,960
Long story short, the caterer
was totally cool with everything,

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,750
but the Marriott did keep our deposit
on the banquet room, so...

27
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,420
Yeah. Communication.

28
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,570
...details are still emerging
about the Supe terrorist

29
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,200
whose senseless attack
on an apartment building

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,280
left 59 people dead
and over a hundred injured.

31
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,290
His name, Kenji Miyashiro,

32
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,160
a Japanese expatriate
living in the Philippines,

33
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,830
Miyashiro was radicalized
by the extremist group

34
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,710
Shining Light Liberation Army.

35
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,710
Witnesses who caught a glimpse
of the killer

36
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,710
described him
as deadâ€”eyed and unemotional

37
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,340
as he rampaged
through the apartment building,

38
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,470
- killing innocents indiscriminately.
- It wasn't your fault.

39
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,600
Many of the 59 victims have not yet
been identified by law enforcement...

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,100
Kimiko. Look at me.

41
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,850
Look at me.

42
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,080
I... I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry, I was just...

43
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,790
No one can debate
that New Yorkers owe their lives

44
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,050
to the brave actions taken by Stormfront.

45
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,340
Earlier today, Stormfront made
an appearance at a New York City park.

46
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,340
How many more people have to die?

47
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,770
You guys, I have been shouting
up and down the hallways at Vought,

48
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,600
and you know what they're doing
to stop another attack?

49
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,810
Jack.
Let's show Vought What they have to do.

50
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,070
Tomorrow morning, Vought Square.

51
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,900
Be your own hero. Make your voice heard.

52
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,160
I am counting on you to show us the way.
Don't let me down.

53
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,970
There you are.

54
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,150
I was beginning to worry.

55
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,740
I've missed you...

56
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,450
so much.

57
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,410
Are you thirsty?

58
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,430
My good boy.

59
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,710
I ever tell you about my recurring dream?

60
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,260
I'm on stage, alone, at Carnegie Hall.

61
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:10,010
Audience is made up of every poor bastard
who got killed by the superheroes.

62
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,560
What are they doing?

63
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,230
Nothing. They're all just watching me.

64
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,400
Waiting for me to do something.

65
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,990
We hit a dead end on Raynor.

66
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,070
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,580
Christ, I don't want to hear sorry.
Sorry is not an option.

68
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,120
We can't have anonymous
skull-exploding assassins walking around.

69
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,210
What if they hit the Speaker next?
Or the President?

70
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,760
Liberty. You mentioned her before.

71
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:56,430
Second-tier Supe, active in the '70s
She was all over Susan's private server.

72
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,940
Get Marvin to talk to this Liberty.

73
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,810
Address on the back. North Carolina.

74
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,820
All right.

75
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,030
We'll see what we can find.

76
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,530
Wait.

77
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,410
I found Becca.

78
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,540
Or at least our best guess
of where she is.

79
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,090
Vought facility, armed to the teeth.
Won't be easy.

80
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,970
We had a deal. I didn't come through.

81
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,050
Jesus, Butcher, I'm just giving it to you.

82
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,060
It's my fault
you stopped searching for her.

83
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,610
I put a target on Homelander's back
and pointed you right at him.

84
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,360
I didn't know Becca was still...

85
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,490
It'd be good to have one less person
in that audience staring at me.

86
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,340
Hey!

87
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:17,520
See? When you get disrespected over
and over and over, that's what happens.

88
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,020
I mean, how much shit
is he supposed to take?

89
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,270
Everybody respects you.

90
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,280
That fucking terrorist was my save,
not hers.

91
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,070
It was mine.

92
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,990
What, now that media whore
is the face of The Seven?

93
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,290
- No, she's not. No, you are.
- Come on!

94
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,450
It's not just her, it's the entire team.

95
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,870
- No.
- Yes, it is.

96
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,380
It's a whole chain of weak links.

97
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,760
- It's very hard not to take it personally.
- I know. I know.

98
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,850
I'll tell you one thing...

99
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,640
you wouldn't put up with this shit.

100
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,900
One little raise of the eyebrow

101
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,980
and you would've knocked them all
back in line.

102
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,860
- Yeah.
- God, I miss that about you.

103
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,700
You don't need me to do that.

104
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,530
The Seven is your team.

105
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,200
You nurtured them.
You watered and fed them.

106
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,210
That's... I did!

107
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,290
Yes, and if they can't respect that,
or you...

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,970
well, it may be time to tear out the weeds
and start all over again.

109
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,600
Change back. Change back!

110
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,780
I'm sorry! I can only hold a shape
for so long before it really hurts.

111
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,160
Change the fuck back now, Doppelganger!

112
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,540
It's okay. Come here. It's all good.

113
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,250
My little boy. Come on.

114
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
Okay.

115
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,590
It's okay.

116
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,010
I love you.

117
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,470
I love you.

118
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,310
You're the most powerful man
in the whole wide world.

119
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,690
And there's nothing that you cannot do.

120
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,030
Storming an off-the-books
Vought compound alone.

121
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,410
How is it possible that you're dumber
than you look?

122
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,580
Mate, it's Becca.

123
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,630
No shit.
But win or lose, you ain't coming back.

124
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,710
Of course I am.

125
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,630
That's bullshit.

126
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,970
Look, it's not like Vought's
gonna let us settle down in Orlando.

127
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,760
We got to get gone and stay gone.

128
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,470
And what about us?
We're the Spice Girls, right?

129
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,350
You're in charge now. Mazel tov.

130
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,730
I don't want to be in charge.
Matter of fact, I don't want to be here.

131
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,320
I gave up my family for this. For you.

132
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,410
Now, when do I get them back?

133
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,910
You find this Liberty slag.
See what you can rumble.

134
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,410
You jump through a few hoops
for the colonel,

135
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,620
and she'll help you
the same way she helped me.

136
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,710
She always liked you more, anyway.

137
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,550
What about Frenchie'?

138
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,630
He's been high as a kite for days.

139
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,640
He won't even notice I'm gone.

140
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,050
And Hughie?

141
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,020
Kid's a weeper.

142
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
Don't want him to get snot
all over me jacket.

143
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,190
Hey, Homelander.

144
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,090
Maeve begged me to spare your life.

145
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:11,730
So I gave you a second chance,
and you failed me.

146
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,650
What are you talking about?

147
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,900
No more lies.

148
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,370
Go ahead and scream as much as you want.

149
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,660
What...

150
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,540
Whatâ€”- What did I do?

151
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,090
I told you to kill Hugh Campbell
and you hesitated.

152
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,800
I... I said that we should go
to the police.

153
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,180
You disobeyed my orders
because you're with him.

154
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,010
Fuck you.

155
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:57,730
Hughie Campbell broke my fucking heart
worse than anyone ever has.

156
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,780
And part of me
wants to blast his fucking face off.

157
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,610
So no, I'm not with him.

158
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,410
But if you want to kill me...

159
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,450
because I'm not a murderer
and I won't straight up execute someone,

160
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,660
then go ahead.

161
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:21,590
So tell me, am I lying?

162
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,800
You're not lying.

163
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,780
Black Noir. Hi.

164
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,870
Would you like an Almond Joy?

165
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,760
Um...

166
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,890
Do you mean William Butcher?

167
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,190
Okay.

168
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,860
Well, he was definitely on the yacht
with the terrorist.

169
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,110
Some of his known accomplices were too.

170
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,080
We lost them in these storm tunnels.

171
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,000
So, yeah. There you go.

172
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,670
I'll keep you posted when we find them.

173
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,130
Or I can look right now.

174
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,340
Just run a facial recognition search.

175
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,970
Or you can join me.

176
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,900
Hey.

177
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,900
- Thanks for coming.
- Hey.

178
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,950
- You're so bruised.
- No, it's fine. It's okay.

179
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,240
That was all me?

180
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,870
It's cool. Really.
I mean, you know, chicks dig bruises.

181
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,250
When I was in fifth grade,
I took a tether ball to the face,

182
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,340
and Amy Burtenshaw, she brought me
Jell-O Pudding Pops for like two weeks.

183
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,590
I'm talking way too much.

184
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,670
I could've killed you.

185
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
But you didn't.

186
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:36,890
Um...

187
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,980
- I got your voicemail.
- God. Can...

188
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,190
God.
Can we just chalk that up to a drunk dial?

189
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,280
I'm okay, really, it's just...
Do you just mind...?

190
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,870
- You mind if we don't talk about it?
- Yeah.

191
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,700
So we got the Compound V out there
and Vought is still kicking,

192
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:03,960
so we risked our lives
just to make the world way worse.

193
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,790
Wait, no, no, no. That's not true.

194
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,090
I mean, you know, these things, they...

195
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,430
- Look, Annie, they take time.
- How much time?

196
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,180
Just...

197
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,850
Sorry, just give me one second.

198
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,190
Hey, M.M.

199
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,690
Raleigh? Like, the one in North Carolina?

200
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,410
Yeah, okay, okay.
Jesus, I was just asking.

201
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,620
Yeah. Yeah.

202
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,790
Just pick me up
at like 81st and Central Park West.

203
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,000
Okay, okay, all right.

204
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,790
Um...

205
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,800
I have to go.

206
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,130
What's going on?

207
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,760
Can I call you later?

208
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:08,560
Are you just gonna... hang out...

209
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:11,650
- here?
- Yeah, I...

210
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,200
I just... I can't go back
to the Tower right now.

211
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,530
- Why? What happened?
- I can't...

212
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,250
I can't do this anymore.

213
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,510
Are you fucking insane?

214
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,050
She can't come with us, Hughie,
she's chipped.

215
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,720
So I have a second cousin
who lives around there.

216
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,680
I could tell Vought I'm going to visit.

217
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,930
We'd be out of the city,
away from cameras.

218
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,270
- I mean, no one would see us.
- No.

219
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,440
Even her standing here is dangerous.

220
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,150
Maybe he's right. I...

221
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,110
This is a bad idea.

222
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,950
If we're gonna go
knock on some Supe's door,

223
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:03,870
don't you think it makes a bit of sense
for us to have one of our own?

224
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,660
Look, she's in rough shape.

225
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,250
She needs this.

226
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,880
You mean you need this.

227
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,930
Hey. How you doing? Cool.
What's up, man?

228
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,070
Fuck.

229
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,120
Don't bullshit me, Ashley.

230
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,870
Shockwave is just here
to talk about Vought for Tots.

231
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,580
I swear to God.

232
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,290
What the fuck is Vought for Tots?

233
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,080
It's a new fitness outreach for toddlers.
Apparently, they're getting obese.

234
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,380
Well, shit, I fucking love fat kids.
Use me.

235
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,920
Good, you're here.

236
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,130
You tell him yet?

237
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,640
Tell me what?

238
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,220
I thought we were gonna have
a strategy meeting.

239
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,390
A-Train, you're out.

240
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,430
- Out of what?
- Out of The Seven.

241
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,270
You did great,
but we're going in a different direction,

242
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,690
so you're out.

243
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,820
What the fuck?
You just said everything was fine.

244
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,950
You're gonna have a whole year of parades.
Tribute concerts.

245
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,910
You're gonna hit the talk show circuit,

246
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,950
you're gonna have
your own reality show on Vought Plus.

247
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,120
The outpouring of love and gratitude
is gonna be off the charts.

248
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,870
This is bullshit!

249
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,420
You used to get my fucking coffee!

250
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,220
Fuck this. I'm not going.

251
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,760
Aâ€”Train, you can't run.

252
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,850
- Yes, I can run. I just...
- Buddy.

253
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,980
You think I don't know
What's been going on?

254
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,940
It's your heart.

255
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,110
I doubt you're even
cracking the top 20 anymore

256
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,320
and that makes The Seven, me,
look pretty ridiculous.

257
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,490
I do want you to know, though,
this was really hard for me. Okay?

258
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:09,870
It's nothing personal.
We'll always be friends and... et cetera.

259
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,540
Attaboy.

260
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,940
- Does anyone mind if I put on some music?
- Yeah.

261
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,190
God.

262
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,450
You have a really good voice.

263
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,530
You can do that, like, wavering thing
they do on American Idol.

264
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,580
Vibrato.

265
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,410
You've got to be kidding me. No, no.

266
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,580
There it is. Yep.

267
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,920
â™ª We didn't start the fire â™ª

268
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,260
â™ª No, we didn't light it
But we tried to fight it â™ª

269
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,470
â™ª Birth control, Ho Chi Minh
Richard Nixon back again â™ª

270
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,810
â™ª Moonshot, Woodstock
Watergate, punk rock â™ª

271
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,060
â™ª Begin, Reagan, Palestine
Terror on the airline â™ª

272
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,230
â™ª Ayatollah's in Iran
Russians in Afghanistan â™ª

273
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,570
â™ª Wheel of Fortune, Sally Ride
Heavy metal suicide â™ª

274
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,900
â™ª Foreign debts, homeless vets
AIDS, crack, Bernie Goetz â™ª

275
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,070
â™ª Hypodermics on the shore
China's under martial law â™ª

276
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,620
â™ª Rock and roller, cola wars
I can't take it anymoreâ€”â€” â™ª

277
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,580
Hey, hey!

278
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,700
This ain't no
little Vegas road trip, okay?

279
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,330
Y'all ain't on no date either.

280
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,790
Just chill.
I'm not your goddamn chaperone.

281
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,220
They say if you love someone,
you should set them free.

282
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,760
But that seems crazy to me,

283
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:55,020
because if you love someone,
you will never let them go. Never.

284
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,060
Have you heard of The Lovers of Valdaro?

285
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,480
They were alive like 6,000 years ago,
and they were found in this tomb in Italy.

286
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:07,610
These two skeletons
with their arms around each other.

287
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,110
That's love.

288
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,400
You smell like a wet dog.

289
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,950
Oh, you want a drink?

290
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,700
Whoa, who says I'm alone, asshole?

291
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,470
So are you gonna tell me what's wrong?

292
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:15,100
Or you just gonna stain my clean sheets
with your sweaty despair?

293
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,480
I tried to kiss her.

294
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,440
Kimiko?

295
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,310
Her brother died.

296
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,440
I wanted to make her feel better.

297
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,610
You thought a kiss
would make her feel better

298
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:29,570
or you feel better?

299
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,160
She was in pain. I wanted to help.

300
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,330
You always want to help.

301
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,580
So?

302
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,210
You think that by saving her...

303
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,460
you can make amends
for all the people you hurt.

304
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,420
For those children
that Lamplighter burned.

305
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,470
- Okay.
- You don't know anything.

306
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,560
Look, she's not a kitten up a tree.

307
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,060
Just leave her alone.

308
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,780
Let her grieve.

309
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,820
What good does grieving all alone ever do?

310
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,620
And in our continuing coverage
of the recent revelations over Compound V,

311
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,910
protesters all over the Middle East
have taken to the streets demanding...

312
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,330
- Thanks.
- I'll be right back.

313
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
Um...

314
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,940
You two want a room?

315
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,570
You and the donut.

316
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,530
I'm sorry.

317
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:58,700
It's just my mom
never let me have this stuff.

318
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,660
Just, weight gain in our household
was a capital crime.

319
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,130
But my dad,
he'd take me to Dunkin' on the sly

320
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:12,010
and he would get me
a chocolate cream-filled donut...

321
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,140
and he'd ask me to tell him about my day.

322
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,640
And he'd... he'd listen.

323
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,770
Baskin-Robbins...

324
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,570
every Sunday after church.

325
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,200
My pops, he'd always ask for samples.

326
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,790
Now, this place had 31 flavours,

327
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,080
and that man would taste
each and every flavour,

328
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,290
every time we'd go up in there.

329
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,790
There'd be a line out the door.

330
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,460
People would be mad as hell,
yelling, cussing.

331
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,840
"Yo, my man,
get your fucking ice cream and bounce!"

332
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,680
You think that stopped him? Hell, no.

333
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,100
He would stand right there
and order another sample.

334
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,560
"Can I please try
the Jamoca Almond Fudge, please?"

335
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,230
My ass was so embarrassed.

336
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,770
I'd be sitting there, wishing the floor
would open up and just swallow me whole.

337
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,900
Man.

338
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,700
Of course, now I'd give a year off my life
just to be able to see that man

339
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,830
going through spoon after spoon
just one last time.

340
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,920
- When did he...?
- Sixteen years ago.

341
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,420
To fathers and sugar.

342
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,720
To fathers and sugar.

343
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,190
Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you dry-wiping?

344
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,980
- Am I what?
- Come here.

345
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,070
Listen, any part of your body,
and I mean any part,

346
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,530
when you dry-wipe,
you're not cleaning anything.

347
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,490
You're just smearing shit
all over your skin.

348
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,290
Here, got to use wet wipes.
There you go.

349
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,750
- You just carry these around with you?
- Damn right.

350
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,180
- No, no, no.
- They're hurt, they need help.

351
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,800
No, no, no.
This is not the time to be a Supe, okay?

352
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,260
We're low-key. Not with us here.

353
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,180
- Annie.
- I mean...

354
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,560
There's a ton of people here.
Okay, that guy, he's calling 911.

355
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,020
It'll be okay.

356
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,730
Come on. Come on. We got to go.

357
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,730
- Told you this was a bad idea.
- Calm down.

358
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,470
Anyplace around here
without a million bloody cameras?

359
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:54,770
- Are you okay? Did he hurt you?
- No. I'm okay. I'm fine.

360
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,940
I thought you were dead.

361
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,980
I stopped looking,
I shouldn't have stopped.

362
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,110
I couldn't call anybody.

363
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,990
I can't imagine
what it must have done to you. I'm sorry.

364
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,820
I'm so fucking sorry.

365
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,660
No, you've done nothing wrong.

366
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,170
Look at you.

367
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,340
My girl.

368
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,670
Always.

369
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,970
Billy, it's not safe for you to be here.

370
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,140
He finds you, he's gonna kill you.
And you know that.

371
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,690
Fuck him.

372
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,860
I got out of the last scrape all right,
didn't I?

373
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,570
That was a one-time deal.

374
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,610
What'd you say to him?

375
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:49,530
I said if he hurt you,
I would kill myself in front of Ryan.

376
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,790
And my last words would be,
"Your father did this to me."

377
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,710
He seems desperate for a relationship
with his son, so it worked once.

378
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,290
Well...

379
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:04,420
it's a good thing
he don't know your tells.

380
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,380
I wasn't bluffing.

381
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,140
I'm gonna get you the fuck out of here.

382
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,680
Yeah? How?

383
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,430
Over the fence.
The same way that I come in.

384
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,060
No. No, Ryan can't climb that fence.

385
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:21,770
Right.

386
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,320
I saw his eyes glow.

387
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,950
I thought he might...
Don't he got no powers?

388
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,460
No. I mean, yes,
but I'm not raising him like that.

389
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:47,380
Hey. There's a garbage truck
that comes by the house

390
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,680
every morning at 11.

391
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,720
I doubt anyone checks the hopper.

392
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,100
- You sure it's not a fucking compacter?
- Yes, I'm sure.

393
00:30:55,810 --> 00:31:00,690
- Okay. Then that's the plan.
- Yeah. Yeah.

394
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:07,990
I have to go.

395
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,820
They get suspicious
when I'm gone too long.

396
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,210
Wait here. I'll be back. Okay?

397
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:33,100
Okay, so we got two rooms,
there's three of us.

398
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,010
So I guess I'll be...

399
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,180
bunking with M.M., naturally.

400
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,270
Good choice.

401
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,220
That an Almond Joy?

402
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,560
Nobody likes Almond Joy.

403
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,890
Jeffrey Dahmer.

404
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,390
That's it. He's the only one.

405
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,400
This is in my top three for sure.

406
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,900
What are your other two?

407
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,110
Charleston Chew and Bit-O-Honey.

408
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
Jesus Christ.

409
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,700
Those are the, like, three worst
candy bars in the history of candy.

410
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,120
That's it. You're sick. In the brain.

411
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:50,010
- Hey, what's up with M.M.'s OCD?
- Wait, what OCD?

412
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:56,680
You know, when he changes lanes,
he taps the steering wheel three times.

413
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:00,600
He stirs the coffee three times.

414
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,640
The antiseptic wipes. Really?

415
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,150
- You haven't noticed any of this?
- No. But, wow, you're right.

416
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,360
Yeah.

417
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,700
It's just control over things
he can't control, I guess.

418
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:18,240
I mean, I should be the last one
talking about that.

419
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,500
Says the girl
who's just stress-eating all day.

420
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,870
My God! That was...

421
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,460
I... It was so good.

422
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,420
That was really good. I enjoyed that.

423
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,470
- It's harder than it looks.
- Meh.

424
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,510
I think, you know, actually, I think
I went the other way with the eating.

425
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,770
I think I've lost like seven pounds.

426
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,560
I did not have seven to lose.

427
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,860
Well, I sleep
about four hours a night.

428
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,150
I wish I slept four hours a night.

429
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:57,030
I mean, I'm too busy
chewing my fingernails down to the quick.

430
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,490
I don't know, whatever a...
I don't know what a quick is, but...

431
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,210
Here's one.

432
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,130
I walk around The Seven Tower

433
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,550
with this knot in my gut,

434
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:23,600
just wondering if Homelander
is waiting around every corner to kill me.

435
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,270
It's like living
with a loaded gun in my face.

436
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,310
Do you feel that way now?

437
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,340
Wait. Wait. I got it.

438
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,520
I still want to see you.

439
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,270
Love is a leap of faith.

440
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,780
Like, my last boyfriend was obsessed
with Ed Sheeran.

441
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,530
Yeah, I know. But he was obsessed.

442
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,330
"Shape of You," "Galway Girl,"
the whole catalogue.

443
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:28,370
So he asked me
to get one of these with him.

444
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,500
Two weeks later, he broke up with me.

445
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,590
I fucking hate Ed Sheeran.

446
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,490
Took you ages to quit.

447
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,160
All them little patches?

448
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Do you want one?

449
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,130
No.

450
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,310
The beard's new.

451
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,440
Fancy it?

452
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,440
Haven't decided yet.

453
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,320
How long you been here for then?

454
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,370
Since I gave birth.

455
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,370
Fucking hell.

456
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,040
How are you holding up?

457
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:44,970
Yeah. You know,
you forget about reading the news

458
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,010
or going to a restaurant...

459
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,680
smoking pot on the couch
and eating Cheetos.

460
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,860
I just act like, you know,
Carol-fucking-Brady all day.

461
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,030
It's okay.

462
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:08,530
You know?
Ryan's happy, and that's what matters.

463
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,080
You're gonna like him.

464
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,960
He's sweet...

465
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:25,550
and very smart and... so kind.

466
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,800
I know you hate kids and all,

467
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,640
- but I think that he's pretty...
- No, no, no, I don't hate kids.

468
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,430
I'm just...

469
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,440
not a very good role model, am I?

470
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,070
How have you been?

471
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,030
You know, all right.

472
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,910
Started a private security company.

473
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:55,540
Mm.

474
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:59,500
- You know, weddings, bar mitzvahs...
- Bullshit.

475
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:07,720
Homelander...
said you were "a man possessed."

476
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,260
He said you've been
chasing after him for years.

477
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,640
Well, I thought he killed you,

478
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,890
so, yeah, I've been on a bit of a warpath.

479
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,190
But on the bright side,
I'm sleeping in a basement

480
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,690
beneath a pawn shop in East Flatbush.

481
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:31,450
I'm sorry.

482
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,660
I never wanted that for you.

483
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,330
Well, what was I supposed to do?

484
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:41,000
Let him get away with it?

485
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,960
What was I before you?

486
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,880
Nothing.

487
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,970
And you saved me.

488
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,600
And here you've been,
fucking living in this shithole,

489
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,890
for all this time,
and I haven't been here for you.

490
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,230
I'm gonna make it up to you.

491
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,780
I'm gonna make it up to you
from now till the day I die.

492
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,990
I swear to God.

493
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,390
Is the supervillain threat real?

494
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,810
Hundred percent. Very real.

495
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,230
But The Seven will protect you.

496
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,820
That's right. Right.
Always listen to Maeve.

497
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,980
She always tells the truth.

498
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,570
And we're grateful, every day.

499
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,370
On a related subject, Compound V.

500
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,200
Did either of you know about it
before the news broke?

501
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,330
No. Absolutely not.

502
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,370
Madelyn Stillwell, she lied to all of us.

503
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,620
Turns out she was a monster.

504
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:09,090
We're just as hurt and upset
and confused as everyone else.

505
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,300
Let's talk hashtag "HeroesSoWhite."

506
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,220
The numbers are rather startling.

507
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,970
Ninety-two percent of heroes
are Caucasian.

508
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,930
African American, 6 percent.

509
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,060
Latin and Asian, each 1 percent.

510
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,560
Why doesn't Vought want diversity?

511
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:30,070
Wow, these are some real hardballs,
Maria Menounos.

512
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,530
But check your facts.
Let's take The Seven, for example.

513
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,490
We've got A-Train. He's a Black man.

514
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:40,280
We got Black Noir, he... um...

515
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:45,620
Well, he doesn't identify with any race,
really, so they're covered.

516
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:49,880
And we have a gay hero.

517
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,340
Really? Who in The Seven is gay?

518
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,760
Queen Maeve.

519
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,930
Scoop for you, Maria.

520
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:05,940
Maeve here is a strong, proud lesbian
with a beautiful girlfriend, Elena.

521
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,270
Hispanic girlfriend.

522
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:11,730
And I, for one, am so proud of her.

523
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,700
Where's Elena? What did you do to her?

524
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:22,200
She's fine. What did I do to her?
I set her free, and you.

525
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,830
You've been living in the shadows so long.
Doesn't it feel good to be out in the sun?

526
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:30,590
Hold on. Me and Elena are just friends.

527
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,750
- Just friends?
- Yes.

528
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,710
Because I heard you two
talking on the phone,

529
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,880
and it sounded a little more than friends.

530
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:42,850
So I did a little digging
and imagine my fucking surprise.

531
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:47,940
Okay, we had a relationship. Once.

532
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,310
Once? A relationship. "Relationship"?

533
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,570
That's such a vague word.

534
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:56,280
What does that mean to you?
What, long walks in the park?

535
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,820
A shoulder to cry on?

536
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,110
Scissoring each other raw?

537
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:04,450
I ended the relationship
when I joined The Seven.

538
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:07,790
When I met you.

539
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:10,170
Stop fucking lying to me!

540
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:16,210
I'm at my wit's fucking end with the lies.

541
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,220
We're together.

542
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,430
And you love her?

543
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,310
I see.

544
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:33,270
Well, best of luck to you both.

545
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:39,200
Is it so hard to believe
that I want you two to be happy...

546
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:41,490
and in love?

547
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:48,000
Honestly, Maeve,
I am really, really happy for you.

548
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:04,760
And have you seen Vought's
"Saving America" ads?

549
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:09,480
Don't they make you feel
all warm and squishy and patriotic?

550
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:15,770
Vought wants you to feel calm and safe.

551
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,860
So that you continue
to buy their shitty toys

552
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:23,530
and drinking their shitty energy drinks
and going to see their shitty movies.

553
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:27,620
- Assholes!
- But maybe we shouldn't feel so calm.

554
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,080
- Or safe.
- Yeah!

555
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,290
Take them down!

556
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:33,120
One Super Terrorist
has already gotten through,

557
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,080
more will come.

558
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:39,300
And for all we know, these maniacs
could already have flown over our borders

559
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,220
and be standing next to you,

560
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,840
just waiting for their chance
to kill us all!

561
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:45,430
So, what are we gonna do?

562
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,470
We're gonna sit around
and cross our fingers

563
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,730
that Homelander's gonna save us
when he's not on Maria Menounos?

564
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,230
Or will we demand that Vought do better?

565
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,070
Yeah!

566
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,990
That our government do better!

567
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,650
What do you say?

568
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:13,290
- Stormfront! Stormfront! Stormfront!
- No.

569
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:16,460
Mon coeur, please. You would not survive.

570
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:20,420
Stormfront! Stormfront! Stormfront!

571
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,880
Marry me, Stormfront!

572
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:26,930
We love you, Stormfront!

573
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,180
Let's go home.

574
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:56,960
- Hello?
- Hello. I'm Hughie.

575
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,460
Is there, by any chance,
a woman living here

576
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,130
who used to go by the name of Liberty?

577
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:05,970
No.

578
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,550
Okay.

579
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,640
We have the right address, right?
Is that...?

580
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,690
Please leave.

581
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,360
Miss, I'm sorry if my friend offended you.

582
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,410
But we just want to ask
a couple questions.

583
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:30,240
Just leave me alone.

584
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,080
I took your damn money,
I signed your damn papers,

585
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,330
and I kept my mouth shut.

586
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:37,870
You think we're with... We're not
with Vought, okay? We...

587
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:41,460
We want to learn what we can
about Liberty, that's it.

588
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,130
Then y'all are just some damn fools.

589
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:47,680
It sounds like you know her. Or knew her.

590
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,600
- You're wasting your time. Okay?
- Miss, miss, miss. Hear us out.

591
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,770
After that, you want us to leave, we go.

592
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:58,600
Go ahead.

593
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:04,320
My father was a lawyer.

594
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,570
Small-time, very smart and aggressive.

595
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,410
When I was a kid, something happened
between my family and Vought,

596
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:12,490
which I'd rather not talk about,
but it was bad.

597
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,830
See, my dad, he believed in the law,

598
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:18,790
and that nobody was above it.
Not even Vought.

599
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:23,380
So he went to work.
He got after their asses.

600
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,130
He had one of those... You remember
those little black typewriters?

601
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,510
The manual ones with the keys?

602
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:30,430
I'd go to sleep at night
to all that noise,

603
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,140
my father banging away at that thing.

604
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,600
Wake up the next morning,
he'd still be hammering away.

605
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:36,850
All night.

606
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,270
But, see, Vought wasn't about
to let this one Black man

607
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:42,690
put his foot on their necks.

608
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,030
So they hired teams of lawyers.

609
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:49,700
Paid off judges.
But my father never gave up.

610
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,450
Until one morning, I woke up, and...

611
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:56,580
I didn't hear those keys anymore.

612
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:01,170
Just found him hunched over
that typewriter, dead at 55.

613
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:05,130
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- I'm not here for your sympathy.

614
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:10,130
But I am going to tell you
that his fight got passed down to me.

615
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:14,010
I'm going to make Vought pay
for what they did to him.

616
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,970
And, ma'am, from what I gather,
what they've done to you as well.

617
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,810
I mean, it's been 48 years.

618
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,190
What good is dredging
all this stuff up now gonna do?

619
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:28,820
Honestly, we don't know,
but we still need to hear it.

620
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,450
I tried to get people to listen.

621
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,370
Lord knows, so many times, I tried.

622
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,750
But a little Black girl accusing
a white superhero of murder...

623
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,710
- in these parts?
- Yeah.

624
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:53,930
It was during one of those summer rains...

625
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:57,850
that you just knew was coming
by the smell in the air.

626
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,190
I was 11 years old.

627
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:08,610
Asleep in the back seat of my folks' Ford.

628
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,110
My brother, Myron, he was driving.

629
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,950
What's the trouble, ma'am?

630
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:18,700
- Get out now.
- Hey.

631
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,870
Your car was involved
in a robbery tonight.

632
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:24,960
No, it wasn't. I had it.
I don't know nothing about any robbery.

633
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,290
Just confess.

634
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,300
Why are you doing this to me, lady?
Ain't you supposed to be a hero?

635
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,880
I am a hero,

636
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,510
for killing a Black piece of shit
like you.

637
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:53,150
I wanted to go to the police.

638
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,160
But my folks,
they thought it was pointless.

639
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,410
So when that man from Vought,

640
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:03,290
when he showed up
and he offered us that money,

641
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,370
we just took it.

642
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,580
Two thousand dollars.

643
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:14,720
That is what my brother's life was worth,
just $2,000.

644
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,260
But y'all have got to promise me
that you won't tell anybody

645
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,970
that I sat here and I talked to you.

646
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:23,930
Because if that woman finds out that
I opened my mouth, she's gonna kill me.

647
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,980
Miss Hunter, that woman. Liberty...

648
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:32,690
Nobody's seen her since 1979.

649
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,400
She's probably dead by now.

650
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:39,620
No. No. I... Hold on one second.

651
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:49,290
Right here. That's her. Right there.

652
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,790
That's Liberty.

653
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:01,350
Valerie was a little girl, she said
it was raining, so she could be wrong.

654
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:03,060
She seemed pretty certain.

655
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,470
Yeah, but if Liberty and Stormfront
are the same person,

656
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,270
then that makes Stormfront like, what,

657
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:08,520
- 70 years old? More?
- Yeah,

658
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,190
but who knows what Compound V can do?

659
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:13,480
I mean, maybe she doesn't age
like a regular person, okay?

660
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,740
It's the same Stormfront that became
America's favourite two-fisted Supe.

661
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:20,070
And might've popped Raynor's head
for getting too close.

662
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,200
- My God.
- What the fuck is going on?

663
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,960
I didn't know that about your dad.

664
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:35,670
Sounds like he was a real hero.

665
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,220
I thought so, but...

666
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:43,720
Nah. He was just a man with a disease.

667
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:46,020
Passed it down to me,

668
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,350
and, if I'm not too careful,
I might end up passing it down to my...

669
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,480
Who the fuck do you think you are?

670
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,520
What, you think I don't see it?

671
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,980
- Trying to undermine me, steal my team.
- Hold on a minute...

672
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:41,030
Let me tell you right now. It won't work.

673
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,910
I'm the face of The Seven! Not you!

674
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:47,950
Me! I still score higher
in every demo that counts.

675
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:54,460
Eighteen to 34, 18 to 49, 25 to 54,
they all love me.

676
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,380
Well, congratulations.

677
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:03,510
I mean, this constant need to be loved
by everyone is kind of pathetic,

678
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:06,470
Yay.

679
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,230
Okay.

680
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:16,770
Okay. Calm down.

681
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:21,320
I clearly pushed you a little far,
I'm sorry.

682
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:24,860
Look, I'm... I'm just trying to help.

683
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:27,410
Really? How?

684
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,620
By taking what's mine?

685
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,000
Let me tell you something right now.

686
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,830
I built this team from the ground up,

687
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:37,670
and there is no fucking way
that anyone is gonna take it away from me.

688
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:42,260
You spent $273 million
on that "Saving America" bullshit,

689
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,050
and I'm running circles around you

690
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:47,550
with five guys on laptops,
churning out memes.

691
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,430
I practically pay them
with Arby's gift cards.

692
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:56,900
You can't win the whole country anymore,
no one can.

693
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,360
So why are you even trying?

694
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,480
You don't need 50 million people
to love you.

695
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:05,990
You need five million people
fucking pissed.

696
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:10,330
Emotion sells, anger sells.

697
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:14,370
You have fans. I have soldiers.

698
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:22,090
Look, I know
that you probably won't believe this...

699
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:27,720
I think that you are the best of us.

700
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:34,350
I think that you
are everything we should be.

701
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:39,900
You just need a little help
connecting with your audience.

702
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,780
You know, change with the times.
God knows I did.

703
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:57,370
I don't need help
connecting with my audience.

704
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,080
Thank you.

705
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,800
Okay. Well, just know I'm always here.

706
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,130
Door is always open. For anything.

707
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,770
You're late. Where's the kid?

708
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,280
Hey, we got to get in the truck.
We'll miss our chance.

709
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,240
I'm not leaving.

710
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,910
What are you talking about? You are.
Grab the kid, let's go.

711
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,540
You don't want Ryan to come with us.

712
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,660
Of course, I do.
I said I'd take him, didn't I?

713
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,410
And I wanted to believe you.

714
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,000
Believe me.

715
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,840
Come on, we've got to get a shift on.

716
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,010
Listen, if the three of us leave,
you're gonna find a way to get rid of him.

717
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:53,470
I know it.
It won't be in an obvious way,

718
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,970
- it won't be right away, but you will.
- No, Becca.

719
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,390
Billy, I know you.

720
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:00,310
I know you better than anybody,
and I saw it in your face.

721
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,850
I see it now.

722
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:10,070
He's a billion dollar piece
of Vought property.

723
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,910
They are not gonna let him go.

724
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:19,200
You and me...
Becca, you and me, we've got a chance.

725
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:21,920
Babe, it's Ryan they care about, not us.

726
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,040
Yeah, and then what?

727
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,880
And then Vought raises him
without a mother, right?

728
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,920
Then we have Homelander again
and there's two assholes in this world.

729
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,510
We could disappear, all right.
Just start again.

730
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:33,090
- Start a new family.
- I have a son.

731
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,850
He's a fucking Supe freak.

732
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:42,310
Fuck. Listen, I... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

733
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:48,230
Becca. Becca, please. Come with me.

734
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,280
You were wrong about me, do you know that?

735
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,280
You put me on this pedestal,

736
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,950
and the truth is
I never knew how to save you.

737
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,200
You were always one bad day away

738
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:02,660
from pounding someone to death
in a parking lot.

739
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:06,790
- That's not true.
- Billy.

740
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:09,380
He raped me.

741
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:13,130
And when I found out I was pregnant,
I went to Vought.

742
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:16,510
I didn't come to you.

743
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,180
I didn't come to you
because I was scared.

744
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,690
I knew that you'd chase after him,

745
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:26,440
and you would seek revenge,
and it wouldn't be good for anybody.

746
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,780
- I love you.
- I love you.

747
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:36,910
But the hate that you carry
and the warpath that you're on...

748
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,200
it started so long before me.

749
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:44,370
I can't...

750
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:00,680
- Becs. No, I'm not leaving without you.
- You have to go. Please.

751
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:06,190
Every guard in this goddamn place
is gonna be here in 60 seconds.

752
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:08,900
You have to go.

753
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:15,400
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

754
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,130
Shit.

755
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:49,810
Small token of the trip.

756
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,980
John Wayne Gacy
used to give those out to kids

757
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,570
- when he was a birthday clown.
- Whatever, I still love them.

758
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,900
Thanks for letting me come.

759
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:02,530
It was fun until it got so horrible.

760
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,700
Yeah. What can I say? It's my speciality.

761
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:13,300
Well, listen, if you're ever in the mood
for another Almond Joy,

762
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:17,130
just shoot me a text.
That came out so gross, I'm sorry.

763
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,380
Hughie...

764
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:22,550
We can't do that again.

765
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:25,470
No. No, no, no. No, we can't.

766
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,850
Why, though? I mean, the...

767
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,350
This is good.

768
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,270
But that's just it.

769
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:40,070
I mean, we can't afford to feel good,
or to feel safe, or to let our guard down.

770
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,120
But you can't go through this on your own.

771
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:48,580
We're all alone. That's the truth.

772
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:52,250
It doesn't have to be like that.

773
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,680
Goodbye, Hughie.

774
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:25,530
I believe the secret
to a great relationship

775
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:30,410
is to be willing
to do anything for your man.

776
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:32,620
Anything.

777
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,340
I'm a feminist, but I'm also very sexual.

778
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,260
And I don't see that as contradictory.

779
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:48,970
What's wrong with giving pleasure?
And receiving it?

780
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:54,150
Thank you for coming in, Gianna.
Yeah, we appreciate your candor.

781
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:56,980
Thank you so much.

782
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:00,610
Anytime. It was really great meeting you.
Really great.

783
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,200
So great.

784
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,620
Bye.

785
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,500
Her. Gianna. I choose her.

786
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,880
I mean, she's the one. No question.

787
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,130
- No, she isn't.
- Wait, what?

788
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:22,920
She was, like, hands down the winner.
It was not even a contest.

789
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:24,840
It's Cassandra.

790
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:26,850
Cassandra? The one...?

791
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:30,560
The one with the hair and the creepy
skeletons hugging each other story?

792
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,520
Yes. That's your wife.

793
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:38,060
But I thought I got to choose.

794
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:43,150
You do. And you're choosing Cassandra.
Congratulations.

795
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,620
Yeah, but... I mean, Gianna...

796
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:50,700
Is lovely. She's lovely.
She's a valued member of The Collective.

797
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:54,960
But this marriage
isn't about satisfying your base desires.

798
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:59,630
It's about rehabilitating your image
and getting you back in The Seven.

799
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,300
That is what you want, isn't it?

800
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:23,280
There you are.

801
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,490
I was beginning to worry.

802
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,670
I missed you.

803
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:54,390
Are you thirsty? Want some?

804
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:00,190
I want you so bad.

805
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:08,780
Are you okay?

806
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:12,280
Would you like me to be someone else?

807
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:15,160
I can be whoever you want.

808
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:23,590
No.

809
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,380
I don't need anyone...

810
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:32,600
but myself.

811
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,360
Like what you see?

812
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,280
See how hot you are?

813
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:01,210
Come on.

814
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,800
How much do you want this?

815
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:09,720
How much?

816
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:21,230
I'm gonna suck your cock so fucking hard.

817
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:23,190
So good.

818
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,440
You're gonna look in your own eyes
when you come.

819
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:34,120
And it's not even gay
if it's with yourself, right?

820
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,910
You're so special.

821
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:46,800
The most special man on the planet.

822
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:49,920
Everybody loves you.

823
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:52,880
Everybody.

824
01:04:54,470 --> 01:05:00,270
Their love is your strength.

825
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:13,360
You're pathetic.

826
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,210
I don't need everyone to love me.

827
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:32,720
I don't need anyone.

828
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:42,680
I don't need you!

829
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,720
