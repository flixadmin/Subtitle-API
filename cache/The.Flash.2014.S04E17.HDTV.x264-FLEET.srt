1
00:00:00,062 --> 00:00:01,501
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,504 --> 00:00:04,048
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:05,255
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,258 --> 00:00:07,218
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:08,710
But secretly, with the help

6
00:00:08,713 --> 00:00:10,210
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:12,190
I fight crime and find other meta-humans

8
00:00:12,192 --> 00:00:13,391
like me.

9
00:00:13,393 --> 00:00:15,160
But I became lost in time.

10
00:00:15,162 --> 00:00:16,928
It took everything in my friends' power

11
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,930
to bring me back, and in doing so

12
00:00:18,932 --> 00:00:21,399
our world was opened up to new threats.

13
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:23,868
And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

14
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,617
I am the Flash.

15
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,107
Previously on "The Flash"...

16
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:30,500
He only wants the bus metas.

17
00:00:30,503 --> 00:00:32,296
He wants their powers. All of them.

18
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,111
DeVoe has absorbed
the powers of Killgore,

19
00:00:34,114 --> 00:00:37,682
Hazard, Black Bison,
Brainstorm, and Dwarfstar.

20
00:00:37,684 --> 00:00:39,051
I'm gonna take DeVoe down.

21
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:40,169
Just like Izzy would have wanted.

22
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:41,453
DeVoe orchestrated everything

23
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:42,887
to get the people he wanted on the bus.

24
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:45,056
We got a planner, just like Thawne.

25
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:47,259
This is an intelligence booster.

26
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:49,427
I'll finally be able
to outthink the Thinker.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,699
- Daddy!
- Pleased to meet you, sir.

28
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:56,835
The last two remaining bus metas...

29
00:00:56,838 --> 00:00:59,571
Janet Petty and Edwin Gauss.

30
00:01:01,074 --> 00:01:02,440
- Ralph.
- Ready.

31
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:04,042
Enact double scarlet's speeds-turn.

32
00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:06,411
- Three, two, one...
- Wait!

33
00:01:06,413 --> 00:01:08,446
I got a better idea.

34
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:10,515
Over here, Doc Ock.

35
00:01:12,104 --> 00:01:13,652
Watch this, Master Splinter.

36
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:17,022
Turtle power!

37
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:24,462
Shut it down.

38
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:30,502
All right, let's run it again.

39
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:31,936
We got to make this work.

40
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:33,638
Does he know that?

41
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:36,141
Ralph?

42
00:01:37,377 --> 00:01:38,543
Ralph!

43
00:01:39,813 --> 00:01:41,279
What?

44
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:43,948
One more time, please.
Follow Barry's plan?

45
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,284
You know, the one where I
spent hours of my precious time

46
00:01:46,286 --> 00:01:48,286
programming realistic holograms for you.

47
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,722
Which... bravo on that by the way.

48
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:51,990
- Thank you.
- Look.

49
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:53,692
Just morph yourself into Barry.

50
00:01:53,694 --> 00:01:55,393
There'll be two Flashes,
Thinker won't know

51
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,329
which one is which,
and we'll confuse him.

52
00:01:57,331 --> 00:01:58,718
Kind of a "her" actually.

53
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:00,632
Ralph, you're missing the
point of this exercise.

54
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:02,867
No, I get it. I was just
doing a little improv.

55
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:04,469
But this isn't standup comedy.

56
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:06,305
Yeah, I know that, but if
you just let it play out,

57
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:07,378
it would have worked.
You could have done

58
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,937
some improving of your own.

59
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,373
Comedy comes in threes, man.

60
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:14,379
We're trying to protect
you. DeVoe's coming.

61
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:17,304
We need to be ready. All of us, okay?

62
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:19,140
I still think it's a pretty good plan.

63
00:02:19,143 --> 00:02:21,710
I hide my face. I save my ass.

64
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,929

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

65
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,093
We'd make a fortune.

66
00:02:32,096 --> 00:02:33,831
An improv group made up of superheroes?

67
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,200
We can take it to Washington.

68
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:37,135
- We'd be the DC Comics.
- No, Ralph.

69
00:02:37,137 --> 00:02:38,803
First rule of improv is say yes.

70
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:40,772
Would it kill you to
take training seriously?

71
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:43,708
Would it kill you to open up
your mind grapes just a little?

72
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,710
Hey. We'll get there.

73
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:47,221
Eventually, but we'll get there.

74
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:49,101
He's just making a big
joke out of the whole thing.

75
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:50,915
It's just the way he is, Barry.

76
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:53,218
I know, but I mean, he needs to think

77
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,486
like a hero, stay on point.

78
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:55,581
DeVoe's thought of everything.

79
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,835
We can't just wing this one.

80
00:02:57,838 --> 00:02:59,057
Look, we'll figure it out.

81
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:00,366
We always do, right?

82
00:03:00,369 --> 00:03:01,760
Melting Point's on our team now.

83
00:03:01,762 --> 00:03:03,128
We just have to find
the other two bus metas,

84
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,864
and we'll be in good shape.

85
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:07,098
Yeah.

86
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:12,038
Where are we with tracking down
Edwin Gauss and Janet Petty?

87
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,298
- No, no, he's...
- What?

88
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:16,273
- He's still... shh...
- I ca...

89
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:17,976
- Working on it.
- I can't work

90
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:19,811
with all this noise.

91
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:21,681
That is disgusting, Harry.

92
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:22,983
Really, grow up.

93
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:24,119
Really?

94
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:25,354
It wasn't me.

95
00:03:26,787 --> 00:03:28,186
That was expensive.

96
00:03:28,798 --> 00:03:31,244
Harry, look. Every time you try

97
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:33,075
to locate these guys,
it's the same thing.

98
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:34,696
I'm telling you. You just
crack that thing open.

99
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:36,360
- It's probably broken.
- It's not broken!

100
00:03:36,363 --> 00:03:40,031
It's just finding these
two is complicated.

101
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:41,266
Why is that?

102
00:03:41,268 --> 00:03:43,501
Because this dude, Edwin Gauss,

103
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:45,270
flat out disappeared the day Allen

104
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:47,038
came out of the Speed Force.
No credit card charges.

105
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,541
No bank withdraws. No
social media posts, nothing.

106
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:51,209
- Gone.
- What about Janet Petty?

107
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:52,679
Just as tricky. I asked Joe

108
00:03:52,682 --> 00:03:54,382
to pull her file from CCPD.

109
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:56,317
Her first known record
wasn't until she was 13.

110
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,515
Some sort of a nomad.

111
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:59,387
Last known address: Iron Heights.

112
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,985
- What she in for?
- Trifecta of

113
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:02,921
breaking and entering,
trespassing, and burglary.

114
00:04:02,923 --> 00:04:04,554
But what we should be worried about is

115
00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:07,016
where is she now and
what are her powers?

116
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:10,161
Is that really her handle?

117
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:12,497
- "Null"?
- Okay, well DeVoe needs both

118
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:13,898
of these people for
whatever he has planned,

119
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,467
so we have to figure out where they are.

120
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:17,635
I will, Allen, if I
can get a little peace,

121
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:19,739
a little quiet, and no interruptions.

122
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:23,475
Great.

123
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:27,111
- Cisky.
- Breacher?

124
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:30,348
I need your help.

125
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,554
Little bit of a mixed message here.

126
00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:35,491
I was hunting Lord Crucifer,

127
00:04:35,494 --> 00:04:37,327
leader of the Tenth Circle.

128
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,630
His cult of bloodsuckers ambushed me.

129
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:43,795
They had me surrounded.
So you were attacked by...

130
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:45,124
vampires?

131
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:46,827
Hundreds of vampires!

132
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,967
The battle was fierce,
but I managed to dismantle

133
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,203
his entire force.

134
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:54,706
But when I went to finish off Crucifer,

135
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,708
something happened to me.

136
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:00,328
My powers... they were gone.

137
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:01,530
What do you mean?

138
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,032
I couldn't vibe blast.

139
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:04,715
Crucifer got away.

140
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:06,885
He must have done
something to my powers.

141
00:05:06,887 --> 00:05:08,720
Has this ever happened before?

142
00:05:08,722 --> 00:05:09,954
Never.

143
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:15,994
But Cynthia always said
you were an intelligent man,

144
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:18,696
well-versed in the meta science.

145
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:22,033
I'm glad to hear Gypsy
still remembers who I am.

146
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:23,124
Hey, you're her boss.

147
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:24,536
You would know the answer to this.

148
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:26,337
Does she ever get a day off?

149
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:29,374
Cynthia is very devoted to her job.

150
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:31,175
But in regards to your skills...

151
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:33,144
Yeah, yeah. Let me guess.

152
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:35,304
- You think she's wrong.
- No.

153
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:42,053
What I want to say is
I think you can fix me.

154
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:44,789
Oh.

155
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:50,028
Well, sir,

156
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,397
we would be happy to...

157
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,465
run some tests in the Speed Lab.

158
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,401
You know, see if everything's okay.

159
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:58,403
Thank you, Cisco.

160
00:05:58,406 --> 00:06:00,940
Now I must get some tea.

161
00:06:05,512 --> 00:06:08,446
- He didn't insult me once.
- Nope.

162
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:10,179
I just hope we can help him.

163
00:06:16,356 --> 00:06:18,122
How was your rest, my love?

164
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:19,357
Wonderful.

165
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,792
I've never felt more rejuvenated

166
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:22,427
and ready to realize our dream.

167
00:06:22,429 --> 00:06:24,429
Clifford.

168
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:30,068
The additional dark matter
from our subject metas is...

169
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,503
overwhelming this host's body.

170
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:33,938
How long do we have?

171
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,507
At the present rate,

172
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:37,976
just over a week's time.

173
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:39,117
No.

174
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,220
I will not allow it.

175
00:06:41,223 --> 00:06:43,615
It may be possible to
adjust the biomass index,

176
00:06:43,617 --> 00:06:45,516
recalibrate the energy distribution...

177
00:06:45,518 --> 00:06:47,898
Extend your current host's life.

178
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,389
Odd.

179
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,950
There are already plans

180
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:55,927
for such an adjustment
partially designed.

181
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:58,262
I attempted the same course of action.

182
00:06:58,264 --> 00:07:00,131
Though my mind for engineering

183
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:03,401
is nowhere near as gifted as yours.

184
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:05,637
Well, you got a good start.

185
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,206
I will be able to complete these designs

186
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,174
within a few hours.

187
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:12,043
Rest, my love.

188
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:15,346
I will handle everything.

189
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:17,048
You always do.

190
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,018
And then we will continue on our search

191
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,721
for the remaining two bus metas.

192
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:26,491
You mean three.

193
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:28,484
The Weeper is still at large.

194
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:31,963
Yes.

195
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:34,601
Three.

196
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:38,201
Perhaps my mind is
being affected as well.

197
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:39,771
Hm.

198
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:50,181
Come on, put your back into it!

199
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:52,784
Put your fat back into it!

200
00:07:54,554 --> 00:07:56,521
This stinks, man.

201
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:59,190
This is too heavy, and you're too weak.

202
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:01,859
Let's get the big dolly.

203
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:44,119
Dude, the crate's gone.

204
00:08:44,122 --> 00:08:45,835
We got to call the boss.

205
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:03,663
Well, well, well, well.

206
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,503
The crown fits.

207
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:13,011
We were moving... I was telling the guy,

208
00:09:13,014 --> 00:09:15,455
"It's gonna take all
night to move this stuff."

209
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,651
Okay, remember, let's just be discreet.

210
00:09:17,654 --> 00:09:19,454
Neither one of us are
supposed to be here.

211
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:21,523
- Can you do that?
- Can pigs fly?

212
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:22,749
- No.
- They can if you

213
00:09:22,752 --> 00:09:23,892
put them on an airplane.

214
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:25,293
Think, Allen, think.

215
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:26,561
Okay.

216
00:09:26,563 --> 00:09:28,129
Just here with your chai latte,

217
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:29,464
Detective West.

218
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:30,832
- Subtle.
- It was gone...

219
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,934
Will you excuse me just a sec, okay?

220
00:09:34,571 --> 00:09:35,837
Hey.

221
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,705
- What happened?
- Robbery.

222
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:40,341
Stole the Kahndaq Dynasty family crown.

223
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:42,653
It was brought here for
the museum exhibition.

224
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:45,547
The security guard said
that it was being transported

225
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:47,082
in a steel-plated crate,

226
00:09:47,084 --> 00:09:48,826
weighs about 200 pounds.

227
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:50,996
Suddenly disappeared without a trace,

228
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:53,546
and then reappeared completely smashed.

229
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:55,640
So was anything else
missing in the museum?

230
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:57,270
Just the crown, nothing else is missing.

231
00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:58,880
Should I, uh, stretch
around the perimeter?

232
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:00,095
- Check things out?
- No, no.

233
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:01,863
I mean, I can tell from
here, to cause that type

234
00:10:01,865 --> 00:10:03,064
of impact, the case had to be moving at

235
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:04,699
at least 55 miles per hour.

236
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:05,934
So we're looking for a meta

237
00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:07,786
- with super strength.
- I mean, maybe.

238
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:09,395
Are there fingerprints on the case?

239
00:10:09,398 --> 00:10:11,239
I'll have them dust
it, send the results in.

240
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:13,108
Why wait? I can just grab the tape.

241
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,609
- Get the prints right now.
- No, hey.

242
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:15,810
It was definitely Killer Frost,

243
00:10:15,812 --> 00:10:18,079
- and she looked at me.
- Ralph!

244
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:20,615
Whoa!

245
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:23,852
Dude!

246
00:10:23,854 --> 00:10:25,553
I need this job!

247
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:27,822
Allen! Look what you did.

248
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:30,250
Threw it at me! That's you, bro.

249
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:40,869
Die, Plastoid, die!

250
00:10:43,273 --> 00:10:44,439
Again.

251
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:53,548
All right.

252
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,150
Uh, I... I think...

253
00:10:55,152 --> 00:10:56,751
I think that's enough.

254
00:10:56,753 --> 00:10:58,486
All right, hey, look, Breacher,

255
00:10:58,488 --> 00:11:00,906
I know you're clearly very...

256
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:03,891
frustrated, uh...

257
00:11:03,894 --> 00:11:06,594
Don't stress, okay? We're
gonna figure this out.

258
00:11:06,596 --> 00:11:08,499
And once we do, we're gonna fix it.

259
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,801
I promise.

260
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:13,735
Cisky.

261
00:11:13,737 --> 00:11:15,136
Look.

262
00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:17,338
I'm sorry for the way I treated you.

263
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,873
But when you fix me,

264
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:22,844
I'll give Cynthia more
time to be with you.

265
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,846
Really?

266
00:11:24,848 --> 00:11:26,214
Yeah.

267
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:29,983
Now... I'm hungry.

268
00:11:29,986 --> 00:11:31,484
We can fix that, too.

269
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:34,422
Um, there's donuts in
the downstairs break room.

270
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:36,224
Help yourself. It's a huge selection.

271
00:11:37,092 --> 00:11:40,427
Yeah. Try the pineapple fritters.

272
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,997
And don't forget to
try the nacho donuts.

273
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:44,832
Those are really good.

274
00:11:47,804 --> 00:11:50,138
Looks like things are looking up

275
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,839
for your boy Cisco.

276
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:54,242
- Yeah...
- What?

277
00:11:54,244 --> 00:11:56,377
What... what is it?
What is wrong with him?

278
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:58,843
Nothing, really. He seems
to be in good health.

279
00:11:58,846 --> 00:12:00,515
There's nothing abnormal
in his bloodwork,

280
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:02,850
and his body scan showed
no signs of cellular damage

281
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:05,553
despite years of using
vibrational powers.

282
00:12:05,555 --> 00:12:07,222
Okay, so then why the face?

283
00:12:07,224 --> 00:12:10,523
Because Crucifer didn't
take his powers from him.

284
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:12,594
Father Time did.

285
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:14,696
He can't blast because
he's getting older?

286
00:12:14,698 --> 00:12:17,865
Mm-hmm. Powers like yours
requires a lot of energy.

287
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,867
And when that energy
starts to dwindle...

288
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:22,981
Vibe blasts are...
the first things to go.

289
00:12:22,984 --> 00:12:24,606
I think you have to tell him.

290
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:28,343
He's never, ever gonna let
me see Gypsy if I tell him.

291
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:30,445
He's probably gonna send a knife

292
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:33,047
flying right through
my skull if I tell him.

293
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:35,283
He might.

294
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:37,085
But it's the right thing to do.

295
00:13:04,214 --> 00:13:06,180
What the...

296
00:13:11,788 --> 00:13:15,390
Initiate chemical analysis.

297
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:25,515
A $40,000 vase?

298
00:13:25,518 --> 00:13:26,884
It's not like it was made of gold.

299
00:13:26,887 --> 00:13:28,702
Actually it was, and you two

300
00:13:28,705 --> 00:13:30,238
can't go to crime scenes anymore,

301
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,706
- Pis or not.
- Don't give me that look.

302
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:32,940
I was just trying to
speed up the process

303
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:34,304
finding this meta, Allen.

304
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:37,011
- Which is taking forever.
- Wait, we got a hit.

305
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:38,313
Jeannie Williams.

306
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:40,481
Oh, wait. We got multiple hits.

307
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:42,249
Jane Liska, Judy Newton.

308
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:44,785
She's used like 17 different aliases.

309
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:46,539
Okay, so how do we find her?

310
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:48,655
We can't just wait for
her to rob somebody else.

311
00:13:48,658 --> 00:13:50,224
Well, we don't have to.

312
00:13:52,262 --> 00:13:54,362
We have the many
variations of her façade.

313
00:13:54,364 --> 00:13:56,748
Right, we simply plug
these many variations

314
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:58,317
into the facial recognition software.

315
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,635
- See if we get a hit.
- Exactly right.

316
00:14:00,637 --> 00:14:02,870
That's starting to come in handy, Harry.

317
00:14:03,773 --> 00:14:05,139
That's 40 minutes ago.

318
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:06,601
Corner of Orchard and Broome.

319
00:14:06,604 --> 00:14:08,099
Orchard and Broome? What's over there?

320
00:14:08,101 --> 00:14:10,812
Not what. Who.

321
00:14:10,814 --> 00:14:12,113
Come on.

322
00:14:12,115 --> 00:14:13,648
- What do you...
- Come on.

323
00:14:18,855 --> 00:14:20,788
It smells like liverwurst.

324
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,657
Yeah, wait till we get inside.

325
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:26,260
- Open up!
- Okay, stick to the plan.

326
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:28,396
We question her. We
find Null. We cuff her.

327
00:14:28,398 --> 00:14:30,865
Got it. A little good
cop, bad cop action.

328
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:37,271
Who the hell are you?

329
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:39,540
Your worst nightmare.

330
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:41,843
Uh, Joe

331
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:46,013
Detective Joe West, CCPD.

332
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,815
We got a couple questions
for you, scum bag.

333
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:50,184
Hey, only my closest
friends can call me that.

334
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:55,356
Word is, there's a new cutpurse in town

335
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:57,024
who likes fancy jewels.

336
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:59,994
Last seen in this part of town.

337
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:01,362
PI Barry Allen.

338
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:03,043
- PI Barry Al...
- Show him.

339
00:15:03,046 --> 00:15:04,637
- Show him!
- Oh, Barry Allen,

340
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,981
I know all about you.

341
00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:08,136
Spectacular fall from grace.

342
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:09,637
- Tragic, really.
- Yes, thank you.

343
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,839
- Just take a look.
- Huh.

344
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:14,756
We're guessing she came here

345
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,325
for help to wash the sparklies.

346
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:17,739
Oh, I should be so lucky.

347
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:19,380
Certainly wouldn't mind a drop-in

348
00:15:19,382 --> 00:15:22,417
from a lovely looking lassie
like this, you know what I mean?

349
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:24,419
But unfortunately not in my cards.

350
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:26,387
I'm sorry. Can I keep this?

351
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:29,215
I will mess you up for lying in my face.

352
00:15:29,218 --> 00:15:30,491
- Ralph.
- Ralph?

353
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:32,260
- There's no Ralph here.
- Joe...

354
00:15:32,262 --> 00:15:34,262
I'm Detective Joe West,

355
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:37,098
the baddest... dad cop

356
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,166
you've ever come across.

357
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:39,467
As God is my witness

358
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:41,265
I am not lying. I'm not.

359
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:45,306
Oopsy-daisy.

360
00:15:45,308 --> 00:15:46,908
I knew it.

361
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,243
Joe West doesn't make any mistakes.

362
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:50,511
Okay.

363
00:15:50,513 --> 00:15:52,246
Where'd she go, Earl?

364
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,020
Deal's off.

365
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:00,488
Damn it.

366
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,193
Cuffs.

367
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:06,427
- Cuffs!
- Allen...

368
00:16:09,632 --> 00:16:11,299
Uh...

369
00:16:12,635 --> 00:16:13,835
Oh...

370
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,689
Babe, you okay?

371
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:28,929
I just want to get down from
here as soon as possible.

372
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:30,509
Maybe you should try
to burp yourself down

373
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:32,199
- like Charlie Bucket.
- Ralph.

374
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,467
Anything?

375
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:35,339
Well, as best I can tell,

376
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:37,237
Null's powers effect
the density of his cells.

377
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,329
It's like you've been filled

378
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,673
- with helium.
- Terrific.

379
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:41,108
Always knew you were a lightweight.

380
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,508
- I swear Ralph...
- Hey, is there a way to

381
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:46,813
- reengage gravitational...
- Gravitational force.

382
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:50,117
Huh, turns out...

383
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:52,297
- not necessary.
- Do not let go.

384
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,553
Based on Barry's standard mass

385
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,042
and the gravitational force G

386
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:56,790
and taking into account
the half-life decrement

387
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:58,825
of Null's dark matter infusion,

388
00:16:58,827 --> 00:17:00,706
this effect should eventually just...

389
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:01,995
wear off.

390
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:04,471
Wear off?

391
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:05,799
Your cells should return to normal

392
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:07,501
- right about...
- What the hell?

393
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:12,039
- Now.
- Two for the landing,

394
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,062
but perfect ten for the thud noise.

395
00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:15,709
Why are you joking right now?

396
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:18,539
I mean ser... what the
hell was that back there?

397
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:19,893
Pretending to be Joe?

398
00:17:19,896 --> 00:17:21,848
I committed to the bit.
I couldn't blow my cover.

399
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,917
Ralph, what if that had
happened outside on the street?

400
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,673
I could have floated
away into the stratosphere

401
00:17:25,675 --> 00:17:26,745
or fallen to my death.

402
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:27,888
I would have figured something out.

403
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,390
Out of the 12

404
00:17:29,393 --> 00:17:30,490
bus metas we have found,

405
00:17:30,492 --> 00:17:32,092
DeVoe is in control of seven of them.

406
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,694
If he gets Null, it'll be eight.

407
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:35,729
If he gets control of her powers,

408
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:38,198
we're talking about your life here.

409
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:42,929
Sorry, I was just thinking
about the end of "Lost."

410
00:17:42,932 --> 00:17:44,844
I mean, were they in purgatory?

411
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:46,440
What did Kate really see in Jack?

412
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:47,774
Ralph.

413
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:52,579
I'm sorry, man, but I'm benching you.

414
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:53,947
- Why?
- Because you're constantly

415
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:55,215
in the middle of a comedy routine

416
00:17:55,217 --> 00:17:56,550
instead of doing what you should.

417
00:17:56,552 --> 00:17:57,884
If you had just tossed me the cuffs,

418
00:17:57,886 --> 00:17:59,286
we would have Null right now.

419
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:00,580
Yeah, or she could
have ran out the door,

420
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:02,660
and I stretch the cuffs on her
when she didn't see it coming.

421
00:18:02,662 --> 00:18:05,229
It's fine.

422
00:18:05,232 --> 00:18:07,332
Look, I'm doing what's best for you.

423
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:09,429
No, you're not.

424
00:18:09,431 --> 00:18:10,997
You're doing what's best for you.

425
00:18:17,606 --> 00:18:19,906
Display, complete physiological results

426
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:22,042
for DeVoe, Marlize.

427
00:18:24,317 --> 00:18:26,450
Cortisol levels low.

428
00:18:28,517 --> 00:18:30,150
Recent display of tachycardia,

429
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,918
repetitive pupil dilation.

430
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:36,531
Display serotonin level.

431
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:39,326
319 nanograms.

432
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:42,963
Levels found in patients

433
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:47,267
using psychoactive
narcotics. How is that?

434
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:54,674
Subject four's still at large.

435
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:03,216
Created to provide
widespread euphoria...

436
00:19:06,088 --> 00:19:07,721
Or feelings of love.

437
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:22,234
What if we put him on
an all-alkaline diet?

438
00:19:22,237 --> 00:19:25,405
Full of antioxidants.

439
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:27,007
Nope.

440
00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:29,776
Okay, what if we...

441
00:19:29,778 --> 00:19:31,445
Oh, what if we make a super shake

442
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:34,834
full of, like, enzymes
and... and... and probiotics?

443
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:37,138
Neither of those are gonna
work long-term, Cisco.

444
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,786
Okay, well, we got to come
up with something, right?

445
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:42,923
I mean, how old is this guy anyway?

446
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:47,160
This guy's old.

447
00:19:47,162 --> 00:19:49,485
We have to solve this.

448
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:53,766
'Cause I don't know about you,
but I actually like my life.

449
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:56,036
I know this isn't the easy answer,

450
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:58,038
but I think you have to tell him.

451
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,206
Cisky!

452
00:20:00,274 --> 00:20:03,797
Oh, hey, you. We were
just talking about you.

453
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,453
I've tasted all your donuts.

454
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,014
Where's my cure?

455
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:10,016
Well, it's a little, um,

456
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:11,418
it's a little complicated.

457
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:15,956
But! You are lucky, my friend,

458
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,974
because your fix

459
00:20:18,977 --> 00:20:21,595
is as simple as taking one of these

460
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:22,996
little pink pills.

461
00:20:22,998 --> 00:20:24,898
- Blue.
- Blue pills.

462
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,333
Right there.

463
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,794
"Anta-hista-mine."

464
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:31,938
That's right, an antihistamine.

465
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,743
See, "stamine," that's
Latin for stamina.

466
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:38,974
Which you have plenty of, you know.

467
00:20:38,977 --> 00:20:41,414
You have so much of it that
it's actually hurting you.

468
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,104
But this antimatter pill...

469
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:44,351
It's gonna level you right out.

470
00:20:44,353 --> 00:20:46,152
Oh, you're taking it now.

471
00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:48,455
He's... he's taking it now.

472
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,300
Why is my vibe blast different?

473
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:03,393
I think it's a side effect of the pills.

474
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,563
Hasn't been thoroughly researched yet,

475
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:08,107
but you know, there's
headaches, nausea...

476
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,144
different, uh, color vibes.

477
00:21:11,154 --> 00:21:13,521
I'm cured. Thank you.

478
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,349
Anytime.

479
00:21:19,188 --> 00:21:21,889
You do realize you're
just making this worse?

480
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,261
Nothing on Null so far.

481
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:29,996
Harry's gonna try something else.

482
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,899
- We'll find her.
- We have to.

483
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:36,269
Even if Ralph does everything
in his power to screw it up.

484
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:37,771
Barry.

485
00:21:37,773 --> 00:21:38,972
That is not his intention.

486
00:21:38,974 --> 00:21:40,495
Well, he could have fooled me.

487
00:21:40,498 --> 00:21:41,908
It's his life. I mean, if there's

488
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,743
anything he cares about, it's losing it.

489
00:21:43,745 --> 00:21:45,045
Well, he's gonna lose
it if he doesn't start

490
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:47,380
thinking like me, like I taught him.

491
00:21:47,382 --> 00:21:48,682
Thinking like you?

492
00:21:50,385 --> 00:21:51,985
He's never gonna do that, Barry,

493
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:54,387
and you can't expect him to.

494
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:56,556
Oh, boy.

495
00:21:58,226 --> 00:22:00,026
Robbery at Central City Jewelry.

496
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,461
Man, she loves bling.

497
00:22:01,463 --> 00:22:03,363
- I'm on it.
- Wait, you need backup.

498
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,205
Well, Ralph's too much
of a liability right now.

499
00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:06,299
He stays benched.

500
00:22:06,301 --> 00:22:07,667
- Caitlin, Cisco?
- They're with Breacher.

501
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:08,974
It would take too long to wait for them.

502
00:22:08,976 --> 00:22:11,477
- Then what's the plan?
- The plan...

503
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,707
is "occulation."

504
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,008
You said her fingertips,

505
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,543
they illuminated when
she used her powers.

506
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:18,545
That means dark matter
accelerant, that means

507
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:21,488
powers are generating
from the optic nerve...

508
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:25,150
What I'm trying to say
is Null can't gravitate

509
00:22:25,153 --> 00:22:27,387
what she cannot see,
so you vibrate beyond

510
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,923
the speed of sight as you
approach her eye line...

511
00:22:29,925 --> 00:22:31,791
I'll be invisible to her.

512
00:22:31,793 --> 00:22:33,960
- It worked against DeVoe.
- Let's try it.

513
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,575
What the...

514
00:22:49,978 --> 00:22:51,444
Didn't see that coming.

515
00:22:51,446 --> 00:22:52,746
It's kind of the point.

516
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:56,629
No, you didn't see that coming.

517
00:22:58,153 --> 00:23:00,587
See, I call it my getaway car.

518
00:23:03,392 --> 00:23:05,725
'Cause either the person in there dies,

519
00:23:05,727 --> 00:23:08,061
or you let me get away.

520
00:23:31,053 --> 00:23:33,319
You okay?

521
00:23:33,321 --> 00:23:35,488
It's okay. Just stay here.

522
00:23:45,713 --> 00:23:47,269
This useless piece

523
00:23:47,272 --> 00:23:49,550
of trash is... useless.

524
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,589
It's like I'm so dumb
I can't even come up

525
00:23:51,592 --> 00:23:54,066
with a good synonym for
this useless piece of trash.

526
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:56,013
Harry, no one could have predicted

527
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:57,383
that Null would have picked herself

528
00:23:57,385 --> 00:23:58,684
out of the cuffs or taken a hostage.

529
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:00,018
Nor did either of you predict

530
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,487
the location of a 120-pound woman

531
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:02,980
using the curvature of spacetime

532
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,818
caused by the uneven
distribution of mass

533
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:06,898
yet still somehow failed to account

534
00:24:06,901 --> 00:24:10,092
for the gravitational
pull of a 4,000-pound car

535
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:13,630
floating right above her head.

536
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:14,998
Scientists have spent decades

537
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:17,272
trying to understand
relativity and quantum gravity.

538
00:24:17,275 --> 00:24:18,765
This is not about
understanding gravity, Allen.

539
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:20,151
It's about understanding her

540
00:24:20,154 --> 00:24:21,506
or not understanding her.

541
00:24:21,509 --> 00:24:22,842
As it turns out, DeVoe

542
00:24:22,844 --> 00:24:24,956
can somehow calculate human behavior.

543
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:25,990
Harry, stop.

544
00:24:25,993 --> 00:24:27,326
Look, I'm the one that let her get away.

545
00:24:27,328 --> 00:24:29,114
- You did your best.
- Did I, Allen?

546
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:31,017
Really? This is the second meta

547
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:33,452
to evade the dampening cuffs.

548
00:24:33,454 --> 00:24:36,355
It's been almost a
year, and where are we?

549
00:24:36,357 --> 00:24:38,391
And where's DeVoe?!

550
00:24:42,345 --> 00:24:43,811
What?

551
00:24:45,511 --> 00:24:47,678
Nothing, it's just...

552
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:49,686
you went out into the
field, you had a plan,

553
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,622
and... it didn't work.

554
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:54,173
But they do for DeVoe.
Harry's not wrong.

555
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:56,242
DeVoe's gone over every possible outcome

556
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,710
before making his plans.

557
00:24:57,712 --> 00:25:00,146
Which we can't do,
and neither can Harry.

558
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:01,848
Well, then what are we supposed to do?

559
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,206
I mean, you just want us to
adlib like Ralph wants us to?

560
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:07,854
Barry, you didn't see it,
but when you were gone,

561
00:25:07,856 --> 00:25:10,081
Ralph rose to the
occasion. He cracked jokes.

562
00:25:10,084 --> 00:25:11,550
He thought outside the box.

563
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:14,026
I mean, he got the job done
in the way that he knows how.

564
00:25:14,028 --> 00:25:17,230
So, the question is,

565
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:18,631
are you upset with Ralph

566
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:20,362
because you think he's screwing around

567
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:22,368
or because he's not following your plan?

568
00:25:24,873 --> 00:25:26,472
Breacher!

569
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:28,040
I thought maybe we could have a drink.

570
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:29,242
I don't know, you strike me as kind of

571
00:25:29,244 --> 00:25:30,676
a tequila guy, so...

572
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:35,047
Oh, crap.

573
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,888
You've come back to die, Breacher.

574
00:25:43,525 --> 00:25:45,391
The time has come, Crucifer.

575
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:47,560
Die, vampire, die!

576
00:25:50,428 --> 00:25:52,698
Frack me, he's gonna die.

577
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,233
Die!

578
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:02,308
Wait a second.

579
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:06,546
Hey, back up, yo.

580
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:10,283
Yo, "Dust Till Dawn", I think
it's time you saw some sun.

581
00:26:11,475 --> 00:26:14,453
Idiot, sunlight doesn't
hurt this type of vampire.

582
00:26:14,455 --> 00:26:16,088
What?

583
00:26:17,525 --> 00:26:18,724
Time to go.

584
00:26:18,726 --> 00:26:20,126
Whoa!

585
00:26:24,623 --> 00:26:27,441
You said your antimatter-histamine

586
00:26:27,444 --> 00:26:29,135
would cure me.

587
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:31,029
Yeah, I did say that, didn't I?

588
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,173
You lied to me.

589
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,042
You said you could fix me.

590
00:26:36,044 --> 00:26:38,644
Now I'll fix you.

591
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:43,749
Breacher, stop!

592
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:45,751
Your vibe blasts don't work.

593
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:50,990
And they're not gonna work.

594
00:26:51,926 --> 00:26:53,492
Why not?

595
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:56,295
Because of your age.

596
00:26:57,838 --> 00:26:59,538
I should have told you earlier.

597
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:02,409
It's just I know how
special our powers are,

598
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:05,638
and you were so happy at the
thought of having them back.

599
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,207
And I miss your daughter.

600
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:11,043
I just wanted to see her again.

601
00:27:11,045 --> 00:27:12,411
I'm sorry, Josh.

602
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:20,186
I hate you.

603
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:28,694
You did the right thing.

604
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,865
Yeah.

605
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:36,602
Thanks.

606
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,739
Just wish he knew that.

607
00:27:42,284 --> 00:27:44,183
Clifford is lying to you.

608
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,781
He is drugging you with sedative tears

609
00:27:48,783 --> 00:27:50,639
to keep you idle.

610
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,586
Please.

611
00:27:53,596 --> 00:27:56,006
Please, remember.

612
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:59,258
Escape.

613
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:07,900
New lemonade recipe.

614
00:28:07,902 --> 00:28:09,201
Save.

615
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:11,604
Already exists?

616
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:20,212
Please don't forget.

617
00:28:20,214 --> 00:28:22,615
He's lying to you.

618
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,784
He's drugging you.

619
00:28:25,753 --> 00:28:27,119
He's a monster.

620
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:28,721
You must escape.

621
00:28:28,723 --> 00:28:31,372
You always save it under the same name.

622
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,941
Escape now.

623
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,627
Every time, you discover it.

624
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,629
It's quite clever, really.

625
00:28:37,532 --> 00:28:39,932
I would expect nothing less from you.

626
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:44,470
How many times have I been through this?

627
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,939
Too many.

628
00:28:46,941 --> 00:28:49,608
But that is of no concern.

629
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,744
Because with tears from the Weeper

630
00:28:51,746 --> 00:28:54,108
mixed with Dominic Lanse's powers...

631
00:28:55,182 --> 00:28:56,915
I can alter your memory.

632
00:28:56,918 --> 00:28:59,485
So that's why you created the Weeper.

633
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,487
You didn't need a potential host.

634
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,022
- He was...
- For you. Yes.

635
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:05,358
I knew that the same thing in you

636
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,226
that I fell in love
with had the potential

637
00:29:07,228 --> 00:29:09,495
to destroy us.

638
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,464
Your humanity.

639
00:29:12,466 --> 00:29:14,499
I couldn't let that get in the way

640
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,702
of us achieving our goal.

641
00:29:16,704 --> 00:29:18,167
The Enlightenment.

642
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,319
Clifford, I am your wife...

643
00:29:28,716 --> 00:29:30,449
And I love you.

644
00:29:35,223 --> 00:29:39,025
But you are nothing without me.

645
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,575
This is an interesting
place to hang out.

646
00:30:02,483 --> 00:30:04,847
You come here to suck the
fun out of being benched?

647
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,485
I...

648
00:30:06,487 --> 00:30:09,188
No, I came for your help actually.

649
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,556
You want help from the guy

650
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,691
who can't take anything seriously?

651
00:30:12,693 --> 00:30:14,481
Look, I'm sorry.

652
00:30:14,484 --> 00:30:16,951
I shouldn't have been so quick to judge.

653
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,933
But with DeVoe...

654
00:30:20,935 --> 00:30:23,669
so many steps ahead of us, it just...

655
00:30:23,671 --> 00:30:25,704
To see you joking around
in the middle of this

656
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:29,076
just made me feel like you
weren't taking it seriously.

657
00:30:32,346 --> 00:30:34,947
I know this is serious.

658
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:36,816
I watched...

659
00:30:36,818 --> 00:30:39,085
I watched Izzy die in front of me.

660
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:43,856
I'm scared out of my mind.

661
00:30:43,858 --> 00:30:47,145
Well, you know, you got
an odd way of showing it.

662
00:30:47,148 --> 00:30:49,161
Yeah, well not everybody
grew up with a super dad

663
00:30:49,163 --> 00:30:52,331
like Joe West who makes it easy
to talk about your feelings.

664
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,840
When I was ten years
old, my dad walked out

665
00:30:57,843 --> 00:30:59,105
on me and my mom.

666
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,040
And I was terrified.

667
00:31:01,043 --> 00:31:04,244
But my mom, she was even more afraid.

668
00:31:05,213 --> 00:31:08,013
So, you know, I just
started making jokes.

669
00:31:08,015 --> 00:31:11,567
Started doing stupid gags and funny bits

670
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,953
and whoopee cushions.

671
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:16,456
Anything to push her fear away.

672
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,291
And the thing is, after
a while I started to push

673
00:31:19,293 --> 00:31:20,893
my fear away too.

674
00:31:20,895 --> 00:31:23,629
I had no idea, Ralph.

675
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:26,399
It's not that I don't
care about beating DeVoe.

676
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:30,202
It's not that I don't care
about being a great hero.

677
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:33,906
It's just that ever since
then, anytime that I'm afraid,

678
00:31:33,908 --> 00:31:35,474
I either hide...

679
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:38,244
Or I make jokes.

680
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,348
Barry, we found Null.
Central City Museum.

681
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:46,218
So what do you say? You
want to get off the bench?

682
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,653
I really could use your help.

683
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,989
Well, if doo-ty calls.

684
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,423
- You get it?
- Yeah.

685
00:31:51,425 --> 00:31:52,758
Let's just go, all right?

686
00:32:13,581 --> 00:32:16,749
Now, this is my kind of party.

687
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,130
Listen up, people!

688
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:25,207
Anything that shines,
shimmers, or sparkles

689
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,210
goes in the bag.

690
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:32,081
Ooh-oh, I love me some sapphires.

691
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,333
You're out of your mind

692
00:32:33,336 --> 00:32:34,845
if you think I'm giving this to you.

693
00:32:34,848 --> 00:32:36,219
Oh, give it to me?

694
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,987
No, no, no. No, no.

695
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,856
There's no need for that.

696
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:41,257
No.

697
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,859
I'll just take it.

698
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:44,260
Oh...

699
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,099
And the rest of you,

700
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:51,968
sparklies.

701
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,474
Just hold on, all right? Just hold on.

702
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,513
It's over, Null.

703
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,214
So, back again.

704
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,983
Oh, with a friend.

705
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,751
A good friend, actually.
We hang out on the weekends.

706
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,620
I know where he lives...

707
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:13,556
- No getaway cars this time.
- Right.

708
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:14,991
No cars.

709
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,294
But there are an awful
lot of passengers.

710
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,152
Oh, my God, she's gonna send
everyone into the atmosphere.

711
00:33:27,155 --> 00:33:29,261
Allen, you gotta get everyone
out of there right now.

712
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,145
All right, that's
everyone. Where is she?

713
00:33:37,814 --> 00:33:40,282
- Whoa!
- No!

714
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:41,951
Lookin' fly, Flash!

715
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,053
Back to business.

716
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,322
Oh, God!

717
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,584
Aah... aah!

718
00:33:57,936 --> 00:33:59,636
Guys! I can't reach him!

719
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:01,600
Cisco, you have to breach him somewhere.

720
00:34:01,603 --> 00:34:02,928
He's too high in the atmosphere.

721
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:04,467
I don't have aim like that.

722
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,443
Let Ralph improvise.

723
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:08,377
What?

724
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,889
- What?
- Yes.

725
00:34:09,892 --> 00:34:11,652
Just do something Dibny-esque.

726
00:34:11,655 --> 00:34:14,016
Be your own hero. Just do it fast.

727
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,751
Uh, Dibny-esque.

728
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:17,820
Right. Um.

729
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,658
All about that bling.

730
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,336
Ralph!

731
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:36,238
That was your plan? He's
gonna fall to his death.

732
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,540
I know what I'm doing.

733
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:38,941
Any time, Ralph!

734
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,143
10,000 feet. He's falling fast.

735
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:42,979
Now 5,000 feet.

736
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,369
Oh... ah...

737
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,070
Ralph did it.

738
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:14,175
Nice work, Ralph.

739
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,512
Nice work.

740
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,017
Classy.

741
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,286
You've got to be kidding me.

742
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:30,693
Ralph.

743
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:36,376
All right, Null's in the pipeline.

744
00:35:36,378 --> 00:35:38,845
She's not too happy about it.

745
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:41,514
Well, she's a lot safer
there than she is on her own.

746
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:43,249
Just one more bus meta out there.

747
00:35:43,251 --> 00:35:45,718
Better find him before DeVoe does.

748
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,187
Where's Harry? Isn't he
supposed to be working on it?

749
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:50,690
He grumbled something about
something and then left.

750
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:52,191
I'm fluent in Harry grumble.

751
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:53,693
He said he was gonna work his cat,

752
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:56,929
or he was making himself a turkey wrap.

753
00:35:56,931 --> 00:35:58,798
Well, I'm gonna head over to CCPD,

754
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:01,101
do some more digging
on this Edwin Gauss.

755
00:36:04,172 --> 00:36:05,905
Ralph.

756
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:08,670
Why did a scared-sounding Earl Cox

757
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:10,843
call me saying he was clearing your tab?

758
00:36:10,845 --> 00:36:13,913
Uh, I...

759
00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:16,616
I have no idea. That's really weird.

760
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:26,592
Hey, guys, would you help
me in the, uh, Speed Lab?

761
00:36:26,594 --> 00:36:27,894
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

762
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:30,096
- Work on some improv?
- Yeah.

763
00:36:30,098 --> 00:36:31,330
Ha.

764
00:36:33,268 --> 00:36:35,935
You were great out there tonight, man.

765
00:36:35,937 --> 00:36:37,170
Thank you.

766
00:36:37,172 --> 00:36:38,671
I had a lot of help.

767
00:36:38,673 --> 00:36:41,507
And I had a great teacher.

768
00:36:41,509 --> 00:36:43,443
You helped me realize that

769
00:36:43,445 --> 00:36:46,112
I can't always take
everything so seriously.

770
00:36:46,114 --> 00:36:47,947
Even when it comes to Thinker.

771
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:49,248
Wait a second.

772
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,818
Are you telling me that I, Ralph Dibny,

773
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:55,855
taught Barry Allen, superhero
extraordinaire, a lesson?

774
00:36:55,857 --> 00:36:58,291
- What could this mean?
- Means you're a great hero.

775
00:36:58,293 --> 00:37:00,526
And you make this team
better by being on it.

776
00:37:00,528 --> 00:37:02,305
Ah, the circle is now complete.

777
00:37:02,308 --> 00:37:03,938
When I came here I was but the learner.

778
00:37:03,941 --> 00:37:05,698
Now I am the master.

779
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,301
- It's also good to be humble.
- But how can I be humble...

780
00:37:10,106 --> 00:37:12,153
When I am swollen with pride?

781
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:29,889
- Cisky!
- Ah... jumpin' jellyfish!

782
00:37:32,726 --> 00:37:34,659
I like your new threads.

783
00:37:34,662 --> 00:37:36,696
Yeah.

784
00:37:36,698 --> 00:37:38,731
I went back to my earth.

785
00:37:40,568 --> 00:37:42,902
Saw my reflection in my knife.

786
00:37:44,171 --> 00:37:46,471
- I saw an older man.
- I'm curious.

787
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:48,674
Have you never looked
in a mirror before?

788
00:37:48,676 --> 00:37:50,276
I'm not a teenage girl.

789
00:37:50,278 --> 00:37:52,879
Okay, you're not a teenage girl.

790
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:55,081
But I realized...

791
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:57,683
time to hang up my coat.

792
00:37:57,685 --> 00:37:59,986
This is my new uniform.

793
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:01,554
Like it? Yeah.

794
00:38:01,556 --> 00:38:03,956
Retirement suits you.

795
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:06,893
So, what do you do with all this time?

796
00:38:06,895 --> 00:38:10,263
There'e'a dragon farm on Earth-47

797
00:38:10,265 --> 00:38:12,465
that I've always wanted to visit.

798
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:14,033
A dragon farm?

799
00:38:14,035 --> 00:38:15,868
Okay.

800
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,270
Get your Khaleesi on.

801
00:38:17,272 --> 00:38:18,704
I'm not a Khaleesi.

802
00:38:18,706 --> 00:38:20,206
Okay, you're not a Khaleesi.

803
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:23,142
But I just wanted to tell you, Cisky,

804
00:38:23,144 --> 00:38:24,877
good-bye forever.

805
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,917
Oh, wait! Just one more thing.

806
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:33,786
Now that I'm retired, there's an opening

807
00:38:33,788 --> 00:38:35,354
at the Collection Agency.

808
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:38,357
I would like you to replace me.

809
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:41,427
Wait, I'm... I'm confused.

810
00:38:42,931 --> 00:38:44,463
You want to see my daughter more.

811
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:46,465
Work with her.

812
00:38:46,467 --> 00:38:51,103
Together you and Cynthia
could be an unstoppable duo.

813
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:53,539
So what do you say, Vibe?

814
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:55,675
You want to be the new Breacher?

815
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:06,852
How was your rest, my love?

816
00:39:06,854 --> 00:39:08,087
Wonderful.

817
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:09,388
I've never felt more rejuvenated

818
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,346
and ready to realize our dream.

819
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,925
Clifford.

820
00:39:14,162 --> 00:39:16,162
The added combination of dark matter

821
00:39:16,164 --> 00:39:19,365
from all our subject metas is

822
00:39:19,367 --> 00:39:21,767
overwhelming this host's body.

823
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:23,603
How long do we have?

824
00:39:23,605 --> 00:39:26,372
At the present rate,

825
00:39:26,374 --> 00:39:28,474
exactly one week's time.

826
00:39:28,476 --> 00:39:31,377
No, I will not allow it.

827
00:39:31,379 --> 00:39:34,113
It may be possible to
adjust the biomass index,

828
00:39:34,115 --> 00:39:36,048
recalibrate the energy distribution...

829
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,317
Extend your current host's life.

830
00:39:40,321 --> 00:39:41,587
Odd.

831
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:43,356
There are already plans

832
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:46,726
for such an adjustment
partially designed.

833
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:51,697
I attempted the same course of action.

834
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:53,966
Well, you got quite a good start.

835
00:39:53,968 --> 00:39:58,504
I will be able to complete
the designs in under an hour.

836
00:39:58,506 --> 00:40:00,339
Rest, my love.

837
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:02,341
I will handle everything.

838
00:40:05,013 --> 00:40:07,213
You always do.

839
00:40:07,215 --> 00:40:09,982
And then when you complete your work,

840
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,251
we will continue on our journey

841
00:40:12,253 --> 00:40:16,389
to find the remaining two bus metas.

842
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:19,725
Team Flash has captured subject 11.

843
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:23,989
Now it's time for us to act.

844

845
00:41:29,564 --> 00:41:31,364
Good evening, Dr. Wells.

846
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:34,533
It's been 1,078 days
since we last spoke.

847
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:36,235
How can I be of service?

848
00:41:36,237 --> 00:41:37,903
Hello, Gideon.

849
00:41:39,774 --> 00:41:41,833
A lot has changed since then.
