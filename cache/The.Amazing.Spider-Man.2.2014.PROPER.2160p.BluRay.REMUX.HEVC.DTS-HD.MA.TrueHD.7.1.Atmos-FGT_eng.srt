1
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,531
People will say I am a monster...

2
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,366
...for what I've done.

3
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,036
And maybe they're right.

4
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,540
I always thought that I'd have more...

5
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,834
- ...time.
- Dad?

6
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,586
Dad!

7
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,837
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,715
Peter?

9
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,982
He likes to sleep with the light on
at night.

10
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,734
Mary, we have to go.

11
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,656
Dad.

12
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,118
Be good.

13
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,215
I found a safe place for us to spend
the night at Lake Geneva.

14
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,718
- Are you uploading it?
- To Roosevelt. All of it.

15
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,595
Just in case we...

16
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,099
We're gonna be fine, Mary.

17
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,768
Did you see his face?
He's never gonna understand.

18
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,645
Mary, we've been through this.

19
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,690
Our life as we know it is over.

20
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,485
We're gonna spend every day
from now on looking over our shoulders.

21
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,655
Never feeling safe.
We can't do that to him.

22
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,657
He's just a little boy.

23
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,742
I know, I know. But it's gonna be okay.

24
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,287
It's gonna be all right.

25
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,012
No rest for the weary, huh?

26
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,223
No, I'm afraid not.

27
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,517
Occupational hazard, I guess.

28
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,562
What is it you're working on?

29
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,318
Just planning ahead. Do you think
I could speak with the pilot?

30
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,446
Something you need?

31
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,740
Perhaps I can help.

32
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:04,035
I'd just like to radio ahead and make sure
everything's in order for when we land.

33
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,791
I think we both know
that's not an option, Dr. Parker.

34
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,768
- Richard.
- They say you're a genius.

35
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,018
Richard!

36
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,521
Not if you thought you could escape.

37
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,772
Richard!

38
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:34,982
Mary!

39
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,415
Mary!

40
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Mare.

41
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,138
It's okay. It's okay. That's okay.
It's okay.

42
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,558
I got you. I have you, okay? Okay?

43
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,185
Just gonna make you safe.

44
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,896
It's done. It's done.
Can you breathe? Mare?

45
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,774
- Roosevelt.
- What?

46
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,108
Roosevelt.

47
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,537
It's back up. It's back up.

48
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,289
It's back up, okay? Hey, hey, hey.

49
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,752
We're gonna be all right, okay?
You stay with me.

50
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,257
What do you got for me today,
New York?

51
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,301
Reporting live
from New York 1 chopper.

52
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,888
An Oscorp truck carrying plutonium
has been hijacked.

53
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,932
A police chase is in progress.

54
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,558
All right. Let's get to work.

55
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,774
Say hello to Aleksei Sytsevich!

56
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,180
Spider-Man!

57
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,974
Hello, pedestrians.

58
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,827
Knock, knock.

59
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,829
Mr. Criminal?

60
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,458
Hey, my name is Spider-Man. You can call
me Web-Head, you can call me Amazing...

61
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,710
...just don't call me late for dinner.
You get it?

62
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,714
Not a shaker? Are you a hugger?

63
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,383
- I am killer!
- Whoa, okay.

64
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,511
Warning. Plutonium-238
is a radioactive material...

65
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,346
...and is highly explosive.

66
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,182
Excuse me.

67
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,477
There's more room on the sidewalk,
folks, please.

68
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,519
- Watch it, man.
- I got blueprints here.

69
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,812
A little help?

70
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,190
A little help, please.

71
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,027
You having a problem with your gun?

72
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,528
Let me help you out with that.

73
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,197
Coming through.

74
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,533
Too much work...

75
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,244
Oh, this is bad.

76
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,704
I'm gonna be right back.

77
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,251
Heads up. Watch out.

78
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,798
Okay. Okay. There you go.

79
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,801
- You okay? You all right?
- You're Spider-Man.

80
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,345
Costume gives it away?
These look pretty important, Max.

81
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,430
"Max"? How do you know my name?

82
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,848
It's written on your badge.

83
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,100
I'm a nobody.

84
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,560
Hey, you're not a nobody.
You're a somebody.

85
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:03,478
Lick that.

86
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,063
All right. Listen to me.

87
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,356
- Now I need you.
- Really?

88
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,286
- You're my eyes and ears out here.
- Okay.

89
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,316
- All right?
- All right.

90
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,610
I'll see you out there.

91
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,864
Warning. Violation of protocol.

92
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,646
Hands up!

93
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,902
Get him, Spidey!

94
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,116
Gotcha. Gotcha. Nope. Got you too.

95
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,621
Hey. No. You.
You're not going anywhere.

96
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,373
Come here. Come here.
Come to Daddy.

97
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,961
Get the hell out of the way!

98
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,880
Okay. Stop it! Stop it!

99
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,425
Oh, come on.

100
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,595
Hey, wait. Come back here.

101
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,513
Heel!

102
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,890
I got you.

103
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,822
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm running a bit late.
I got stuck in some traffic.

104
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,866
Your timing is terrible.
It started already.

105
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,476
- Know, I'm sorry.
- Where are you?

106
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,637
1st and Broadway, 2nd and Broadway,
3rd and Broadway.

107
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,246
Five minutes. Ten tops.

108
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,208
- Are those sirens?
- No.

109
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,500
-Peter?

110
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,252
- Peter?
- No sirens.

111
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,921
No--

112
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,714
Peter.

113
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,507
What is happening?

114
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:57,884
Peter.

115
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,469
Peter.

116
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,767
Hello?

117
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,230
- Peter? Pe--
- I'll be right there. Promise.

118
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,901
This year's valedictorian,
please welcome Gwen Stacy.

119
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,084
Good morning, esteemed faculty...

120
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,211
...and families of my fellow graduates.

121
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,672
It's an honor to be
standing up here today.

122
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,846
Hello.

123
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,515
- Hey! Get off!
- I told you.

124
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,558
I am running a bit late.

125
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,394
It's over, Spider.

126
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,645
Really?!

127
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,855
I know we all think that we're immortal.

128
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,732
We're supposed to feel that way.

129
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,067
We're graduating.

130
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,988
But, like our brief four years
in high school...

131
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,490
..what makes life valuable...

132
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,867
...Is that it doesn't last forever.

133
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,537
What makes it precious
is that it ends.

134
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,605
And I know that now more than ever.

135
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,626
And I say it...

136
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,379
...today of all days...

137
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,257
...to remind us that time is luck.

138
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,556
So don't waste it
living someone else's life.

139
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,475
Make yours count for something.

140
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,853
Fight for what matters to you.

141
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,354
No matter what.

142
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,982
Because even if we fall short...

143
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,985
...what better way is there to live?

144
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,583
I'll take that. That's not yours.

145
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,551
This is not end, Spider!

146
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,098
Michael Oates.

147
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,436
Julia Orchard-Heymans.

148
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,066
Alexis Ortiz.

149
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,030
Bo Parisi.

150
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,117
Peter Parker.

151
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,495
Hey, I think I know that guy.

152
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:31,913
Peter Park--

153
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,709
I'm sorry.

154
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,430
Wait, do that again. Do that again.

155
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:55,103
Peter, for Lord's sakes, I almost stole
a cap and gown to run up there myself.

156
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,523
I'd love to have seen that. That would've
been awesome. No, no, this is for you.

157
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,525
- I am so proud of you.
- You earned it.

158
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,152
Sweetheart, I'm so proud of you.

159
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,988
I know the first thing your Uncle Ben
would say.

160
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,240
Yeah, I know too.

161
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,618
"You better hurry up, party's over.
You gotta get a job."

162
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,956
The second thing he would say, "Don't
just follow the path, make your own trail."

163
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,457
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

164
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,251
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

165
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,461
Ben told me he made it up.

166
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,298
You really did learn something here.

167
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,846
I wish your uncle
could have been here.

168
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,266
Yeah, me too.

169
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,435
And my folks.

170
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,396
Yeah. Yeah.

171
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,259
- Would've been good.
- Perfect d--

172
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,945
All right, you can go. Go on.

173
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,196
I'll be right back.

174
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,032
- Is that your program?
- Okay, guys. Get together right now.

175
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,910
A quick one. All right. Cheese.

176
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,745
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

177
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,915
- Okay. I'll just be over here.
- Yeah, just give me two seconds.

178
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,846
- Don't go too far.
- It's good to see you.

179
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,461
- All right.
- All right.

180
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,337
Hey.

181
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,591
Did your traffic jam have anything
to do with the Russian Mob...

182
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,804
...and machine guns by any chance?
Why didn't you just tell me?

183
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,056
What am I gonna do?
You're about to do your speech.

184
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,017
- Gwen. Honey. Family photo.
- Yes?

185
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,267
Okay.

186
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,270
Hey. You coming to dim sum?

187
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,272
Can't keep me away.

188
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,857
It's at 8:00. Don't be late.

189
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,317
- I won't be.
- Okay.

190
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,905
And I'm gonna do my speech for you.

191
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,365
All night? I wanna hear it
all night long.

192
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,659
- Over and over again, all night long.
- Okay.

193
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,578
- Oh, my gosh.
- It was pretty good.

194
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,789
Great. Peter. Join us? Come on.

195
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:44,587
I gotta find my aunt, but
I'm gonna catch up later, thank you.

196
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,672
Hi.

197
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,260
You're gonna make enemies.

198
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,304
People will get hurt.

199
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,225
So I want you to promise me
something, okay?

200
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,354
Leave Gwen out of it.

201
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,107
Promise me that.

202
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,069
She's gonna take
one quick picture, okay?

203
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,251
Peter's outside.
I'm gonna go see if he's okay.

204
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,213
What are you doing? What are you...?

205
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,675
Peter.

206
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:34,845
What is it?

207
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,391
- Hey.
- What's wrong?

208
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,725
Are you all right?

209
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,352
I don't know what I'm doing.

210
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,523
It's my father, isn't it?

211
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,191
Yeah.

212
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,485
I see him everywhere I go.

213
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:54,282
I can't-- I don't know what to do.
And I can't get him out of my head.

214
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,326
- Yeah, but we've talked about this.
- I know, but, Gwen--

215
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,453
- It's not his choice.
- Gwen.

216
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,624
I promised him that
I would keep away from you.

217
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,877
And now I'm gonna come and eat dinner
with your family.

218
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,256
How can I do this?
What does this make me?

219
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,758
I don't know, what does that make you?

220
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,386
It makes me not able to
live with myself.

221
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,268
- I thought that it meant you loved me.
- I do love you.

222
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,646
I love you.

223
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,108
Then why isn't that enough?

224
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,945
Because what if
something happens to you...

225
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,698
...just like it happened to him
because of me?

226
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,118
- No, wait, wait, wait.
- Listen. No, n--

227
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,037
I cannot let that happen.

228
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:42,913
Listen to me.

229
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,832
You're Spider-Man...

230
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,627
...and I love that.

231
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,173
But I love Peter Parker more.

232
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,802
That's worth it to me.

233
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,889
I can't lose you too.

234
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,810
If because you can't lose me,
we can't be together...

235
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,398
...who does that work out for, Peter?

236
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,819
I can't. I'm sorry, Gwen.

237
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,118
You have done this to me...

238
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,831
...again and again, Peter.

239
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,334
I can't live like this.

240
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,421
I break up with you.

241
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,926
I break up with you.

242
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,426
Good morning, New Yorkers.

243
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,011
Looking for another beautiful day
here in the city.

244
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,555
A few clouds to start us off...

245
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,058
The steady increase in sightings
of Spider-Man has sparked a debate...

246
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,686
...over the role of vigilantism
in American crime fighting.

247
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,976
How about that Spider-Man?

248
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,565
Last night on the Manhattan Bridge,
he saved a dozen lives.

249
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,400
We wanna hear your calls.

250
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,987
I think without Spider-Man,
there'd be no hope for this city.

251
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,365
Who do you think pays the bills
for all the damages he causes, huh?

252
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,700
It's you and me, taxpayers.

253
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,493
- You make this?
- Yeah.

254
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,620
This is a wind turbine.

255
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,290
You made this? No way.

256
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,958
This is amazing.

257
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,669
It's good as new, right?

258
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,796
I'll walk you home.

259
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,840
- What's your name?
- Jorge.

260
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,301
Jorge? I'm Spider-Man.

261
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,471
I don't feel like my kids are safe
with him out there.

262
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,557
Get out of the way
and let the police do their job.

263
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,936
Some folks think that there might be
more than one Spider-Man.

264
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,397
What do you think?

265
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,316
One guy or many?

266
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,402
I'd love to know
who's behind that mask.

267
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,653
Hey.

268
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,363
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.

269
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,408
We have a caller on the line named
Max. He says he knows Spider-Man.

270
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,828
Listen, I'm upset. Spider-Man,
to me, is being misunderstood.

271
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,414
He's a very, very good person.
He's protecting us.

272
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,832
He saved my life one time.

273
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,365
We sort of became best friends.

274
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,463
How much?

275
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,923
Hey, you're that spider guy.

276
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,299
I'm Spider-Man.

277
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,139
I'm Spider-Man.

278
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,494
This Spider-Man... He's not
the police, he's not a fireman.

279
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,312
What gives him the right to get
involved in other people's business?

280
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,428
Peter, honey?

281
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,639
Can I come in?

282
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,600
No!

283
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,894
Peter, the final starts at 9, honey.

284
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,230
You said you would take my car
into the shop...

285
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,940
...because it keeps dying, remember?

286
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,110
Give me a second, Aunt May. I'm gonna
get the door. Just give me a second.

287
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,153
Peter, please just let me in. All right?

288
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,405
I'm trying to get my--

289
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,825
You said your final was at 9, and
you're gonna take my car into the shop.

290
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,744
- No! You can't come in. I'm so naked.
- What are you do--?

291
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,414
Peter! For goodness sakes.

292
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:56,625
You said you're gonna take my car
into the shop because it kee--!

293
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,837
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

294
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,213
I'm just--

295
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,007
I'm very naked right now.

296
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,467
What happened to your face?
It's filthy.

297
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,803
- It is?
- Yes.

298
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,848
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I was cleaning the chimney.

299
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:12,933
We have no chimney.

300
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,476
What?

301
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,186
- You're late.
- I know, I'm late.

302
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,063
Downstairs, now.

303
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:21,066
- Can you leave? Because I'm naked here.
- All right, I'm leaving.

304
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,695
- Morning, I love you.
- I love you too. Hurry up.

305
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,030
Well, look who's here.

306
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,448
Spidey.

307
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,283
How was your morning?

308
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,619
Aces, Max, aces.

309
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,871
I've been out saving the world.

310
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,456
Protecting everybody.

311
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,459
But is someone celebrating
a birthday today?

312
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,004
That's why you're here.

313
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,173
You remembered my birthday.

314
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:31,095
All the crime-fighting you've been doing,
and all of a sudden...

315
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,848
...you take time out to come visit
little old me. Max. It's amazing to--

316
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,893
But of course you would.

317
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,645
Why wouldn't you visit me?

318
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:41,730
We're best friends.

319
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,070
What are you doing?
You made me a cake?

320
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,520
People don't get a chance to see these
small, kind things that you do for people.

321
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,540
I know what they say about you
in the press...

322
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,911
...but it doesn't matter to me.
I know the real you.

323
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,788
Because you're amazing.

324
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,041
That's what the press needs.

325
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:04,128
They should call you
The Amazing Spider-Man.

326
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,213
You like that, Spidey?

327
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,382
I like it a lot, Max.

328
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,301
Good. Because today...

329
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,095
...Is going to be...

330
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,346
...amazing.

331
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,100
Yeah. Circuit 39.

332
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,982
I'm not late, Harvey.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

333
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,193
I just wanna know if you can find
another waitress...

334
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,340
...to replace me because I start
my training rounds at the hospital.

335
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,908
And don't mention this to Peter.
I don't want him to know.

336
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,452
Because he'll worry.

337
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,079
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, you got it.

338
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,873
Double shift on Thursday.

339
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,624
Okay, bye.

340
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,129
- Who was that?
- Harvey.

341
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:51,425
- Doing a double shift, huh?
- Sometimes.

342
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,927
Got nothing else to do. I like the girls.

343
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,556
I miss Ben. Gives me a little extra
in the cookie jar.

344
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,978
Well, I sold another couple of photos
to the Bugle, so that ought to help.

345
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,315
Yeah, it would really help if that guy
would pay you a fair wage.

346
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,025
Jameson pays me a fair wage.

347
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,611
If it was 1961, he pays me a fair wage.

348
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:14,281
Hey, wait. What are you doing? What
are you doing? No, I do the laundry.

349
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,533
- I'm doing my laundry.
- No, I do the laundry.

350
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:20,287
No, this is my job. I've been doing
your laundry since you were 6 years old.

351
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,164
I understand that. I'm in college now.

352
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,125
I think it's time that I took care of
my own dirty underwear.

353
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,055
Last time you did the laundry,
you turned everything blue and red...

354
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,355
- ...so no.
- That was a mistake.

355
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,382
Because I was washing
the American flag.

356
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,677
- My-- Can I please just--?
- No one washes a flag.

357
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:36,968
I do, and I won't anymore.

358
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,181
- This is my machine.
- Fine. It's just underwear.

359
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,850
This is my laundry, my home,
my machine.

360
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,393
Back off, eat your breakfast.

361
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,273
All right, laundry sheriff. I'll do it later.

362
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:49,858
- I'll do it.
- No, forget it.

363
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,944
- Give it to me.
- I'll do it some other time.

364
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:54,530
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

365
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,864
Jerk.

366
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:58,992
Not gonna make it.

367
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,665
Logjam. Come on, come on, come on.

368
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,793
- Watch it, buddy.
- Hey, let's go.

369
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:13,924
Oscorp Industries...

370
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:18,595
...is proud to announce the world's
first electromagnetic power grid.

371
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:23,183
By converting aging power stations
into a field of hydroelectric towers...

372
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,937
...we are generating clean, green,
sustainable energy...

373
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,648
...to power Manhattan,
the five boroughs...

374
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,192
...and eventually the world
for generations to come.

375
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,445
- Dillon. You're late.
- Doggone trains are so slow, sir.

376
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,531
Don't you realize Oscorp
is now responsible...

377
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,341
...for the entire city's energy supply?

378
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,535
I submitted a lot of designs
for the power grid...

379
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,912
...and they used a lot of them,
and I noticed that...

380
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,665
...and those power grids
were designed by me.

381
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,166
You designed them?

382
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,460
Sure you did.

383
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,212
And I'm Spider-Man.

384
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,507
You're no Spider-Man!
He's a Leo, you're a Sagittarius!

385
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,886
You besmirch him again, I'm gonna rip
your well-groomed head off!

386
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,096
Now, get to work.

387
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,558
What floor, please?

388
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,102
- Seventy-four.
- Thank you.

389
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,645
Oh, hold that!

390
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,106
- Can you hold that, please?
- I got it.

391
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,317
Thank you, you're a real gentleman.

392
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,360
Most people would have
just let those close.

393
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,237
Most people don't notice other people.

394
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,865
- What floor, please?
- Sixty-three--

395
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,700
I got it. I got it. What is it?

396
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,993
Sixty-three.

397
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,120
Sixty-three, please.

398
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,413
- Thank you.
- In a hurry.

399
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,874
Thank you very much.

400
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,922
I'm Max. Max Dillon.

401
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,506
I'm Gwen.

402
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,550
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

403
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,011
Is it your birthday?

404
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:46,225
Oh, yeah. Well, I-- They--
Friends of mine made this flyer up.

405
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:50,020
I'm having a birthday party
at a big club. A lot of celebrities.

406
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,315
Would love to invite you,
it's just that the guest list is closed.

407
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,777
Oh, got it. Got it.
Well, thank you anyway.

408
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,880
- ...dressed as Spider-Man...
- That's exciting.

409
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,197
...hanging out near the blaze.

410
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,867
It must be cool, huh? To have
the whole world look at you like that?

411
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,329
You know, Spider-Man
saved my life one time.

412
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,415
Out of all the people
in the whole city, he saved...

413
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,667
...me.

414
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,543
He said he needed me.

415
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,797
That must be a good feeling.

416
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,341
Sixty-third floor.

417
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,843
It was nice to meet you, Max.

418
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,556
Wait. She remembered my name.

419
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,242
Welcome home.

420
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,672
It's dark in there.

421
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,008
Your eyes will adjust.

422
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,177
It's better this way.

423
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,541
Dad.

424
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,217
This is not how I imagined
I would die.

425
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,304
Looking at my son...

426
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,639
...and seeing a stranger.

427
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,561
You have such potential, Harry.

428
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,482
Such fierce intelligence...

429
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,567
...and you're throwing it all away.

430
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,819
No, you threw me away.

431
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:08,241
You kicked me off to boarding school
when I was 11.

432
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,037
On my 16th birthday...

433
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,997
...you sent me Scotch.

434
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,333
Or one of your assistants did.

435
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,419
I'm pretty sure because the card read:

436
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:24,049
"With compliments, Norman Osborn."

437
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,010
I don't expect forgiveness from you...

438
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,762
...anymore.

439
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,599
I don't believe in miracles.

440
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,560
How could you possibly understand...

441
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:39,606
...that your childhood
had to be sacrificed...

442
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,608
...for something greater?

443
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,277
And not just for me.

444
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,946
For you!

445
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,159
Has your hand started to twitch yet?

446
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,706
When you lay awake
and you feel it coming...

447
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,751
...hiding under your skin...

448
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,088
...waiting to show itself.

449
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,674
To show you...

450
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,718
...who you really are.

451
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,517
Retroviral hyperplasia.

452
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,813
I never told you...

453
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,066
...that it's genetic.

454
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,736
Our disease...

455
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:30,073
...the Osborn curse.

456
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,452
And it began at your age.

457
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,246
Let me see it.

458
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,333
Your hand. Give it to me.

459
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:51,803
The greatest inheritance
I can give you...

460
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,930
...isn't merely money.

461
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,182
It's this.

462
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,352
The sum total of all my work.

463
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:03,565
Everything I did to stay alive.

464
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,276
Maybe you can succeed...

465
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,528
...where I failed.

466
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:36,723
Norman Osborn, the legendary founder
and CEO of Oscorp Industries, has died...

467
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,642
...the Osborn estate has confirmed.

468
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,186
He is survived by his only son,
Harry Osborn...

469
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,272
...who is the sole heir
of the Oscorp corporate empire.

470
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,732
Harry.

471
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,194
Osborn changed the medical profession's
approach to human healing...

472
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,821
...and affected the lives of millions.

473
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:56,535
I started Oscorp because I looked at
the world around me and I thought:

474
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,246
"We can do better.
And we should do better.”

475
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:04,876
Einstein said, "The world cannot be
changed without changing our thinking."

476
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,629
But change isn't just a slogan.

477
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,756
It begins with hard work.

478
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,426
Change begins with
persistence and commitment.

479
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,180
Mr. Osborn changed the world.

480
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:21,685
And now it's up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive.

481
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,603
But not today.

482
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,730
Today is for mourning.

483
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,108
- Hello?
- Is this Gwen Stacy?

484
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,484
Yes, it is. Who's calling?

485
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:33,572
I'm calling from the Oxford Scholars
Program. We have some exciting news.

486
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,912
- Dillon. You stay here.
- What?

487
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,882
There's a current flow problem in the lab.
Why don't you take a look?

488
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,764
It's my birthday. Everybody else
is leaving. Why do I have to stay?

489
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,296
- Because you're special.
- Smythe.

490
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:50,922
I mean, Mr. Smythe.

491
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,716
Happy birthday.

492
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,847
Bioelectrogenesis:

493
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,892
The generation of electricity
by living organisms to fend off--

494
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,193
Let's see what's going on with you.
Hey, guys.

495
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,597
The genetically manipulated--

496
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,523
At least somebody's partying.

497
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,359
All right. Just a little sick.

498
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,946
I got your medicine, though.

499
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,618
I'm so sick that I can't get to my birthday
after all I put together for this company.

500
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:20,952
Designed the grid...

501
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,705
-Warning:
- I should've stretched.

502
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,625
- Malfunction in Sector 5A.
- I know. Just a little indigestion.

503
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,377
I bet you didn't know it was
my birthday, did you, Kari?

504
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,588
Think you can sing "Happy Birthday"
for me?

505
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,798
I'll just have to sing it for myself.

506
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,300
- Gilbert?
- What?

507
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,054
It's Max. Can we shut down power
on Sector 32, please?

508
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,430
Forget it. I'm out the door.

509
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,480
What do you mean?
I'm up here. It's dangerous.

510
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,059
- Sorry, Max.
- Hello?

511
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,898
Fine. I'll do it myself.
And sing my birthday song too.

512
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,858
This is crazy.

513
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,737

00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,156

520
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,628
Have a nice day.

521
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,588
Harry...

522
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,759
...Oscorp's been under
intense public scrutiny...

523
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,093
...in the wake of Dr. Connors' recent...

524
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,428
...breach of trust.

525
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,012
You mean people are pissed off...

526
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,182
...because he tried to turn everyone
in New York City into giant lizards.

527
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,686
Given that...

528
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:13,356
...all the animal hybrid programs
he was involved in were destroyed...

529
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,859
...to restore investor confidence.

530
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,696
That is the Osborn way.

531
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,533
Whatever's inconvenient around here,
just get rid of it, right?

532
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:27,287
Much of that scrutiny
may fall on you now.

533
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,665
We felt that plausible deniability
was your best option.

534
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,667
Sure, sure. I get it.

535
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,170
Twenty-year-old kid.

536
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,088
Two hundred billion dollar company.

537
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,923
What was Dad thinking?

538
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,676
I mean, you're all lawyers, right?

539
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,348
Surely, someone must've questioned
his sanity in the end.

540
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,810
Someone must've thought about
having him declared legally incompetent.

541
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,188
It would've made this conversation
a lot easier.

542
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,732
- Harry--
- It's Mr. Osborn.

543
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,110
We're not friends.

544
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:05,825
Hi.

545
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,582
You were his assistant, right?

546
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,545
What's your name?

547
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,464
Felicia.

548
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,882
Felicia.

549
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,717
From now on...

550
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,763
...everybody at this table
works for Felicia...

551
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,558
...because Felicia works for me.

552
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,895
Would anybody like to speak up?

553
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,526
Well, good. Then you can all
keep your jobs a little longer.

554
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,155
Sir, there's a Peter Parker
here to see you.

555
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,583
Felicia, I wanna see every file
on this list.

556
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,837
Every single one.

557
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,887
Peter Parker.

558
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,266
It's like seeing a ghost.

559
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,768
Hey, Harry.

560
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,812
Random.

561
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,648
- What, 10 years.
- It's eight.

562
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,234
But you're close.

563
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:23,570
What's up?

564
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,905
I saw the news, man.

565
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:29,367
I heard about your dad
and I wanted to come and--

566
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:33,621
Just wanted to come and see you.
Check to see how you were doing.

567
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,374
I'm with some people.

568
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,129
I'm in a...

569
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:42,922
I'm in a meeting.

570
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,757
I'm sorry, I don't wanna intrude.

571
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,509
I know it's been a long time.

572
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,804
I kind of know exactly
what you're going through right now.

573
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,640
And you were so there for me
when my parents...

574
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,977
Well, that's why I'm here for you.

575
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:57,812
Thank you.

576
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,900
It's good to see you, man.

577
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,612
It's good to see you.

578
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,406
I'm sorry about your dad.

579
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,536
You got your braces off.

580
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,919
Now there's nothing to distract
from your unibrow.

581
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,798
There he is.

582
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,800
There he is.

583
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,845
You still blow-dry your hair
every morning?

584
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:35,767
You know, one of my manservants
holds the hair dryer...

585
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,810
...but I work the comb, okay?

586
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:42,065
So at least I'm not completely helpless.

587
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,317
You're stupid.

588
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:53,201
After graduation, I went to Brazil,
then Singapore.

589
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,571
- That's right, yeah.
- Yeah.

590
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,496
And then Europe.
You know, I went to Europe.

591
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:57,872
I saw you.

592
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,958
What do you mean, you saw me?

593
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,418
I saw you in some magazine
with some French supermodel.

594
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,420
You know what I'm talking about?

595
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,047
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

596
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,342
Dude, that whole model thing
is so exhausting.

597
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,927
I know.

598
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,347
What?

599
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,557
You got a lady?

600
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,897
That's a question.

601
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,441
That's a question.

602
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:26,943
Whoa, buddy.

603
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,529
No, I don't.

604
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,698
Yeah.

605
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,158
I don't know. It's...

606
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,539
I don't know. It's complicated.

607
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,624
Yeah, I don't do complicated.

608
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,587
What's her name? Who is she?

609
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:47,964
Her name's Gwen.

610
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,882
Gwen Stacy.

611
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,386
- Gwen Stacy.
- She works for you.

612
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,096
Really? She works for me?

613
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,641
- She does work-study at Oscorp.
- Is she a model employee?

614
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,870
You know, when my father
sent me away...

615
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,982
...I tried to forget
everything about this place.

616
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,403
I guess that kind of included you.

617
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,034
You ain't gotta explain anything
to me, man.

618
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,328
We both got dumped.

619
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,334
You ever figure out
why your parents bailed?

620
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,090
My dad left a briefcase.

621
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,093
That's all I got, briefcase full of junk.

622
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,637
Whatever. I don't know.
I try not to think about it.

623
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,681
How's that working out for you?

624
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,725
Perfectly.

625
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,108
Dude. Nice arm.

626
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,986
It's just the wrist. It's just all
in the wrist, buddy.

627
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,441
You could do it too
if you just strengthened up that.

628
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:55,948
Yeah, right.

629
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:59,702
You gotta admit, though. Things
have gotten crazy around here, man.

630
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,038
Giant lizards...

631
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:04,540
...and spider guys.

632
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,462
Just one guy. Just one spider man.

633
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,007
Or woman. We don't know for sure.

634
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:17,345
Whatever, dude. He wears spandex
to rescue kittens from trees.

635
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,680
I'm so impressed.

636
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,016
I kind of like to think
he gives people hope.

637
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:23,893
For what?

638
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,854
Maybe eventually
everything's gonna be all right.

639
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,524
Yeah, I just wish I had time
for "eventually.”

640
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:34,821
Who was he?

641
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,824
Maxwell Dillon. Electrical engineer.

642
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,827
No associates or friends to speak of.

643
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,413
He submitted specs for the grid
that we appropriated.

644
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:45,790
The guy was...

645
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,750
...invisible.

646
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:52,588
Wall Street's nervous enough
with that child, Harry, taking over.

647
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,841
We've gotta find a way to get him out.

648
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:59,720
In the meantime, if the press gets hold
of this accident, our stock will crater.

649
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:03,808
So make sure this Mr. Dillon
stays invisible.

650
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,437
This could prove useful for us
in the future.

651
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,672

664
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:12,144
I'm sorry for the spontaneous
outreach. It was kind of...

665
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,855
No. I don't-- I-- Spontaneous...

666
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,233
...is all right. You know.

667
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,944
Well, I just figured it was time.

668
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,280
You know?

669
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,448
Time that we try to be friends.

670
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,117
Yeah.

671
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,205
Friends, yeah. That's...

672
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,332
...great.

673
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,835
I just don't want us
to be complicated.

674
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,254
I was just saying that to someone.
I hate complicated.

675
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,089
Keep it simple.

676
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,051
Okay, great, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right.

677
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,553
Well, I mean...

678
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:52,685
If we're gonna be friends, I think
we gotta establish some ground rules.

679
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,187
- Some ground rules?
- Yeah, some ground rules.

680
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:56,814
Like that.

681
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,274
Like what?

682
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,777
- That laugh. That laugh.
- What?

683
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,571
That's off the table.

684
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,581
- My laugh is off the table?
- Off the table.

685
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,075
You gotta figure out
a more annoying laugh.

686
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,246
That's still adorable.

687
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,999
- That was not adorable.
- It's adorable.

688
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,459
No, it's not adorable.

689
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:19,378
- Okay. I have a ground rule.
- Oh, good.

690
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,880
What is it?

691
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,758
Don't tell me that I look amazing...

692
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:28,054
...with your big brown doe eyes. Okay?

693
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,098
I'm really serious about that one.

694
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,310
- Oh, no.
- What?

695
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,354
I just figured out the next ground rule.

696
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:37,772
What?

697
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,523
No more of this.

698
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,734
No more of this little nose rub
that you do.

699
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,569
- This?
- Don't think I haven't-- Hey.

700
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,530
What am I supposed to do?
It's allergy season.

701
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,199
This is killing me.

702
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,951
You're just spitting in the face
of my ground rules. I'm out.

703
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,453
Come on.

704
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,457
First we get ice cream,
and then I'm out.

705
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:36,539
Yeah. So I did that.

706
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:41,669
And I got completely addicted to
this place that has Korean meatballs.

707
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,588
- Yeah. No, I know.
- Have you been there? It's mind-blowing.

708
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:47,258
That place on 6th. I know.
You love it there.

709
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:51,679
How do you know that?

710
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,559
How do you know I love it there?

711
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,519
Because...

712
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,398
Because you told me.

713
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:07,695
It just opened last month.

714
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,284
Have you been following me?

715
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,124
I knew it.

716
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,001
How often?

717
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,089
Just once a day.

718
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,674
Sometimes.

719
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,761
Sometimes more.

720
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,893
Oh, boy.

721
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:40,394
Why?

722
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,484
Make sure I'm safe?

723
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,195
- And...
- And what?

724
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:52,865
And because it's the closest I can get
to still being with you.

725
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,213
I'm moving to England.

726
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:16,847
What?

727
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,807
Yeah.

728
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:22,853
I have a--
I'm up for a scholarship to Oxford.

729
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,107
In molecular medicine.
And it's between me and this other kid.

730
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,235
There's this oral exam
that we have to do...

731
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:32,238
...and he's, like, a freshman
in college, but he's 14.

732
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:34,365
And-- And it's-- It could be him.

733
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:36,408
But it might be me. I hope it's me.

734
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,954
And I'm thinking that
I'll be moving to England.

735
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,165
Yeah.

736
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,167
And I'm really excited.

737
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:47,920
That's...

738
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:52,508
England.

739
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,679
What?

740
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,112
Station, I need a 10-85.

741
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,365
Send out additional units to
the south-end corner of Duffy Square.

742
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,492
Folks, could you step to the side?

743
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:02,870
Everybody get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

744
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,749
Sir, get your hands
away from the cables right now!

745
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,918
Sir, get your hands
away from the cables!

746
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,129
Let me see your hands, please!

747
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,174
You stay right where you are!

748
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:16,634
Do not move!

749
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:19,011
Freeze! Get down! On the ground!

750
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:38,530
Get down on the ground, now!

751
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:41,408
- Stop!
- Get your ass down on the ground! Now!

752
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,327
- It's not my fault!
- Sir!

753
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,953
- Stop!
- I'm gonna need for you...

754
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:47,004
- Please!
- ...to get down on the ground, now!

755
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,376
For your own safety and the safety
of the other patrons in this area.

756
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,254
Oh, my gosh.

757
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,300
They see me. You see me.

758
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,804
You see me.

759
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,889
They see me.

760
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,945
- No! No! Stop!
- On the ground now!

761
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,823
- Don't do that. Please!
- It's over, freak!

762
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,367
Wait! It's not my fault.

763
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:24,659
It's not my fault!

764
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:28,997
I said stop!

765
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:38,078
I'm glad you're not one of those cops
that rides a horse.

766
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,349
All team members, hold your fire
and wait for my call.

767
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:54,314
All units, hold your fire! I repeat,
hold your fire! Stand down!

768
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,360
Stop. Stop it.

769
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,737
Yo, Sparkles!

770
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,656
Hey, how you doing?

771
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:06,160
- It's you?
- Yeah, I know it's me.

772
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,410
Who are you?

773
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,330
You don't remember me?

774
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,708
No. Should I?

775
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:16,754
I walked into the street. The car
almost hit me. You swooped me up.

776
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,422
You saved me.

777
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,340
You said you needed me.

778
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,260
- You're the guy with the blueprints.
- Yes.

779
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:24,720
Blueprints.

780
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:29,850
Yes, I remember you. Of course I
remember you. You're my eyes and ears.

781
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,895
- What's your name again?
- How could you forget me?

782
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:35,564
- I do, I know it, I know it, don't tell me.
- It's Max.

783
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,608
- Is it "Max"?
- Yes.

784
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,777
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you
with the--

785
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,695
You look different.

786
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,405
How are you?

787
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,491
I don't know what's going on with me.

788
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,785
I can see that. I can-- I believe you.

789
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:53,332
It's strange, the power I feel.
I got so much...

790
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,501
I got so much anger.

791
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:58,504
I can see that. I can see you don't
wanna be here and you're scared.

792
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:00,514
I see you don't know
what's happening to you.

793
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:02,508
I can see you don't want to
hurt anybody.

794
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,453
- It's gonna be all right.
- Got a clear shot. Standing by.

795
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:07,714
- I don't want them shooting me anymore.
- They won't.

796
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:10,265
You guys. This is my buddy, Max.

797
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:13,852
I told you about Max.
No one shoots at Max!

798
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,355
You and me, okay?
It's just you and me talking.

799
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:19,983
Stay right there. Just be careful.
The grate, because of the electricity.

800
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,235
I just--

801
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,863

How about you come with me?
We'll go talk.

Good talk.

842
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,817
Our coverage of this breaking story...

843
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:14,319
...begins with New York 1's
Jessica Abo at the scene.

844
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,017
That's right. We're standing here
with two eyewitnesses...

845
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,079
...who are going to tell us
what they just saw.

846
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,076
Tell us, how do you think
Spider-Man did it?

847
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,869
How do you think
he beat this creature?

848
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,920
Yeah, it's gotta be rubberized,
Spidey's suit.

849
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,706
That's why he didn't get electrocuted.

850
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,251
Probably some kind of neoprene.
That's what I'd use.

851
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,002
Thank you very much
to the two of you.

852
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:33,713
As you can tell, so many questions
remain unanswered.

853
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,524
We will bring you the latest information
as it becomes available.

890
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:32,332
...in public sentiment
in favor of the web-crawler.

891
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:36,419
Tonight, it would seem New York City
owes him a debt of gratitude.

892
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,036
Next-generation military body armor.

893
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:14,291
Features include enhanced mobility,
battlefield injury repair...

894
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,835
...direct nervous system interface.

895
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:28,054
So the common household spider...

896
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:29,639
...unlike human cells...

897
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:32,475
...theirs contain the power
to self-heal...

898
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:36,271
...from severe infection,
tissue damage, et cetera.

899
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:41,109
We've used a radioactive isotope
with compatible human DNA.

900
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:46,239
Welcome to Dr. Jallings,
Science Investigator.

901
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:49,326
Today we're going to be
talking about electricity.

902
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:52,620
Batteries, insulators,
electromagnetic currents.

903
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:55,373
Batteries can withstand
a lot of incoming charges.

904
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:58,793
The more powerful the battery,
the bigger the charge it can withstand.

905
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:02,797
But if the incoming charge
exceeds the outgoing charge...

906
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:05,383
...the battery might explode!

907
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,218
Explode!

908
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:12,891
When doing experiments like this,
always wear protective gear.

909
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:14,267
You're not invincible.

910
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,436
We're gonna need a bigger battery.

911
01:04:57,936 --> 01:04:59,312
- Hello.
- Pete.

912
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,189
It's me.

913
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,149
Hey, Harry. What--?

914
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:05,944
What time is it?

915
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:09,989
Late, early, I don't know.
I've been up all night.

916
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:11,699
I need to see you.

917
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,159
You all right?

918
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:14,786
Not really, Pete.

919
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:16,496
I'm dying.

920
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,499
But I think you can help
save my life.

921
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,088
You're looking at the world's first
human-spider hybrids.

922
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:28,216
The hope is to extract the venom
from their glands...

923
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,885
...and turn that into a cure.

924
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,721
An agent that heals diseased cells.

925
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:39,102
And if I can be cured, imagine what
this could do for other diseases...

926
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,438
...like Alzheimer's, even cancer.

927
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:48,027
They never made it to human trials.

928
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,990
It's 14 years of research,
and nothing to show for it.

929
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:56,453
Except maybe this.

930
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,087
Spider-Man.

931
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,339
What about him?

932
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:12,010
He was bitten by one of those things,
and it worked.

933
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,264
I don't know how
and I don't know why...

934
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:20,143
...but he can do everything else
a spider can...

935
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,520
...including self-heal.

936
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,481
I need to find him.

937
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:26,858
I need his blood.

938
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:43,750
You need...

939
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,003
...Spider-Man's blood?

940
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,634
It'll save my life.

941
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,969
It may not, Har.

942
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,555
It may not be that simple.

943
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,565
You saw what happened
to Curt Connors, right?

944
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:00,808
Connors was weak.

945
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:03,311
This is me, Peter.

946
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,647
I don't think you can just set up a van...

947
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:07,815
...and have him donate.

948
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:13,279
I mean, I'm sure he's sensitive about
people shoving needles and--

949
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:14,656
He's sensitive, okay.

950
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:19,911
Well, then, maybe you could just
sensitively tell me where he is...

951
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,455
...and I will go ask him myself.

952
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:24,081
What?

953
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,962
- You took his picture.
- So?

954
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,214
- You know him.
- Harry.

955
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:34,759
I took a picture from a long way away.
I used a long lens.

956
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,219
I don't know him.

957
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,015
I put together what you said
at the river.

958
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:45,311
- What I--
- About how he gives people hope.

959
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:48,731
Come on.

960
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,538
What in the--?

961
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,044
Just say yes.

962
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,886
Don't turn your back on me!

963
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:22,682
I don't wanna end up
like my father, Peter.

964
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:25,810
Please.

965
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,022
Peter, please.

966
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:30,648
I can't.

967
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:35,695
Please.

968
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:42,201
I'm gonna try...

969
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:44,704
...and find Spider-Man.

970
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:57,759
- Hey, what's security doing over here?
- That's so weird.

971
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,009
She's right over there.

972
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,769
Hey! Miss Stacy!

973
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:25,036
Hi.

974
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:26,537
Hi.

975
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,164
What are you doing here?

976
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,249
What are you doing here?

977
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,294
Come here.

978
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:42,053
She's not here. Check another floor.

979
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:43,680
- Got it.
- Yes, sir!

980
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,014
You're in trouble.

981
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:46,432
- Yeah.
- Who's that guy?

982
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:49,444
There was an accident in the genomics
lab, and they're covering it up.

983
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:52,939
And I found out. That guy
from Times Square last night?

984
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,359
I met him. He was an electrical
engineer in the building.

985
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,570
And he loved Spider-Man, by the way.
He was, like, a fanatic.

986
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:03,449
I didn't get love vibes. I got more of
a "want to kill me with his electricity" vibe.

987
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,743
That's actually kind of what it's like
to love you.

988
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:10,039
I was searching for him in the computer
and all the files, he's erased.

989
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,649
- My God.
- He's completely erased.

990
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,000
That's Oscorp.

991
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:15,128
And what about you? Why are you here?

992
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:16,421
Harry.

993
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:18,131
- Osborn?
- He's dying.

994
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:19,995
- What do you mean?
- He's dying.

995
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,593
And he thinks the only thing
that's gonna save his life...

996
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,513
...is my blood, is Spider-Man's blood.

997
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:28,224
And as far as I know, if I
give it to him, it could Kill him.

998
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,268
Or something worse.

999
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,061
I know.

1000
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,772
This is the maintenance closet, Gwen.

1001
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:38,192
This is the most clichéd hiding place
you could've chosen.

1002
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,483
- This is the stupidest hiding place.
- I'm sorry...

1003
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:44,615
...I didn't take us to the Bahamas
of hiding places.

1004
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:48,619
I gotta talk to you about England,
I guess, because I don't...

1005
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:01,424
- You just kissed me.
- I know, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

1006
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:03,468
How'd you like it?

1007
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:05,303
It felt a little bit rushed.

1008
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:07,680
I know. I know, I know.

1009
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,684
This is the plan. You get to the elevator.
I'm gonna distract him, okay?

1010
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:12,934
Okay.

1011
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,494
- God! Damn it!
- I'm so--

1012
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:32,955
I just spilled a hot latte all over your--
I didn't mean to do that. Oh, no!

1013
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:35,041
And you too? I'm sorry.

1014
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,793
- Miss! Stay right there!
- Sir.

1015
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,295
- Just stay right--
- Wait, wait, wait.

1016
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:40,546
Hey! Stop!

1017
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:44,008
All right. On your way.

1018
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,511
I'm sorry. I'm all thumbs today.

1019
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,476
- Gwen Stacy.
- Oh, my God.

1020
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,728
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

1021
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,313
No, it's okay.

1022
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:00,483
I'm-- I'm Harry.

1023
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,193
Yeah.

1024
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:06,572
- I'm an old friend of Peter's.
- Yeah, I know who you are. Sorry.

1025
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:08,449
I was kind of rushing.

1026
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,118
No, I'm sorry
he never introduced us.

1027
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:13,454
I thought you two had broken up.

1028
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,668
Yeah. Yes, we had.

1029
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:20,461
And it's...

1030
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:22,588
- It's complicated.
- Complicated. Yeah.

1031
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:26,050
I mean, it's Peter. Everything's
always complicated with Peter.

1032
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,301
Yeah.

1033
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,095
Yeah.

1034
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:31,264
Yeah, you're right.

1035
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,599
But that's why he needs you.

1036
01:12:35,226 --> 01:12:36,435
Right?

1037
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:41,107
To help him make his choices clear.

1038
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:45,945
Nice to meet you, Harry.

1039
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:49,198
Yeah, it's such a pleasure, Gwen.

1040
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:48,132
You've been in a terrible accident.

1041
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,385
I'm Dr. Kafka.

1042
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:53,971
I'm here to help you.

1043
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:55,932
Course you are, doc.

1044
01:13:56,974 --> 01:14:01,062
That's why you're preparing
military-grade biostim electrodes.

1045
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,648
High-intensity capacitors.

1046
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,108
The kind they make at Oscorp.

1047
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,278
All of this
because you're trying to help me.

1048
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:10,696
You are correct.

1049
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:13,032
I'm here to study you.

1050
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:17,954
To understand what you are,
why you are.

1051
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,081
Und I will get results.

1052
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:27,296
I always do.

1053
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:31,467
You do realize...

1054
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:33,886
...you locked me in a prison...

1055
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:35,721
...that runs...

1056
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,807
...on electricity?

1057
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,937
I can feel it in the walls.

1058
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,106
I can feel it in my veins.

1059
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,651
No matter what you do, doc,
you can't contain it.

1060
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,237
It's a force of nature.

1061
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:53,906
Like me.

1062
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:02,873
You wanna know how powerful I am?

1063
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,376
Well, so do I.

1064
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:13,175
I'm dying to know...

1065
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,011
...doc.

1066
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:18,764
But you better make damn sure
you Kill me this time.

1067
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,516
Because if you don't...

1068
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:23,185
...I'm gonna kill the light.

1069
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:27,898
So everyone in this city is gonna know
how it feels to live in my world.

1070
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:30,609
A world without power.

1071
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,237
A world without mercy.

1072
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,031
A world...

1073
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:36,907
...without Spider-Man.

1074
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:41,704
And everyone will be able to see me
for who I truly am.

1075
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,373
And who are you?

1076
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:46,375
Don't you know?

1077
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,252
I'm Electro.

1078
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:56,802
Warning: Electrical restraint
capacity reached.

1079
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,805
Initiate lockdown procedure
immediately.

1080
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:01,682
Very impressive...

1081
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,310
...Electro.

1082
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,937
Lockdown initiated.

1083
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:19,950
Aunt May?

1084
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:21,160
Aunt May?

1085
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:27,917
What are you doing?

1086
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,794
When did you do this?

1087
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:41,931
There's something
you're not telling me, Aunt May.

1088
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:45,184
Every time I mention my parents,
your eyes go down.

1089
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,730
I know you're not telling me something.
You lie to me. I know you love me.

1090
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,859
- I don't lie.
- I know you love me, but you do.

1091
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:52,441
Aunt May, Aunt May.

1092
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,236
You have to tell me, May.

1093
01:16:56,237 --> 01:16:57,446
That's my father.

1094
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,115
Yes, he was your father.

1095
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,992
But that didn't seem to stop him
from leaving you...

1096
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:03,869
...here.

1097
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:06,997
I need the truth.

1098
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,794
The truth is, your parents
left you here, on our doorstep.

1099
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,804
You were this little boy
whose whole world...

1100
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:16,757
...was turned upside down
with no explanation.

1101
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:21,762
We did the best we could,
your Uncle Ben and I.

1102
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:25,599
I mean, who else was gonna care for you,
and protect you and worry about you?

1103
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,101
Your father?

1104
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:28,519
No.

1105
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:32,898
I was the one who wiped your nose,
and made you brush your teeth...

1106
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:35,818
...and do your homework,
or washed your dirty underwear. Me!

1107
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:40,781
Your stupid, non-scientific aunt, who
doesn't know how to make ends meet...

1108
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:42,658
...who has to take nursing classes...

1109
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,786
...with 22-year-old kids so I can
pay for you to go to college.

1110
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:48,122
And I don't know how to do this
without Ben.

1111
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:49,498
I don't know how. And--

1112
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:53,460
And you're dreaming about
your perfect father...

1113
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:56,380
...who was never here. No.

1114
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:59,091
No, I won't tell you.

1115
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:00,467
You're my boy.

1116
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:03,053
As far as I'm concerned,
you're my boy.

1117
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:04,388
And I won't hurt you.

1118
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:15,733
I'm your boy.

1119
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:17,735
You're my everything.

1120
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:22,448
You're enough.
You're more than enough.

1121
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:25,117
That's not what this is about.
Don't get that twisted.

1122
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,996
- I love you so much.
- I know.

1123
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:35,211
It's okay.

1124
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:37,671
It's okay.

1125
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:41,800
May.

1126
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:47,097
I need to know.

1127
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:52,937
All right.

1128
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:58,400
I'll tell you everything I know.

1129
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,863
But it will hurt you.

1130
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,074
Okay.

1131
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:10,204
A few days after the funeral...

1132
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:14,208
...two government men came to see us.

1133
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:19,171
They said the genetics research...

1134
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,883
...that your father was doing with
Norman Osborn was very valuable...

1135
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:25,761
...and that people
would pay a lot for it.

1136
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,013
And that's why he ran off with it.

1137
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:29,974
They said he was a traitor.

1138
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:31,976
I couldn't believe it, Peter.

1139
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:35,145
They told us he betrayed
his best friend, all of us...

1140
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:36,855
...for the money.

1141
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:39,233
I don't--

1142
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,071
Oh, I don't get it. No, I don't--
This doesn't make sense.

1143
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:47,950
Yes, I know. I know. I didn't
believe it either. I didn't believe it.

1144
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,451
It doesn't make any sense.

1145
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:50,911
Peter, I don't know.

1146
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:54,373
For so long, I would play it over
and over and over in my head.

1147
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,875
What had I missed?
What had I missed?

1148
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:59,628
He was just this
normal, unassuming guy.

1149
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:02,965
He wore the same ratty lab coat
for 20 years.

1150
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:05,884
He took the D train to work
at 7 every morning.

1151
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,304
Came home at 6 every night.

1152
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:10,889
I don't know.

1153
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:14,685
Maybe everyone has
a part of themselves they hide.

1154
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:18,230
Even from the people they love.

1155
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:25,612
Peter.

1156
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,159
Peter.

1157
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,706
Mr. Osborn.

1158
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:41,879
Look up.

1159
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:44,631
Think you're looking for me.

1160
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:49,553
I cannot believe my eyes.

1161
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:52,598
Spider-Man.

1162
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,899
Just the man I wanted to see.

1163
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,028
You...

1164
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,947
...talked to Peter?

1165
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:10,908
Yeah.

1166
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:20,209
I wanna help you, Mr. Osborn.
I really, really do.

1167
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:24,922
I can't give you my blood.
Not right now.

1168
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:26,298
Excuse me?

1169
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:29,009
It's too dangerous.

1170
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,262
If our blood is incompatible,
you could die.

1171
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,516
I'm already dying.

1172
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:39,269
Your blood can't make me die more.

1173
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,271
But it could do something worse.

1174
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:45,192
Okay.

1175
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,570
All right, how much?

1176
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:51,115
- How much what?
- How much do you want? Name it.

1177
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:55,327
You want a boat? You want a plane? You
want money? How much do you want?

1178
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,831
- I don't want your money.
- Come on. Everybody wants my money!

1179
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:00,666
I don't.

1180
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:04,378
I thought you...

1181
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:07,548
I thought you were supposed to
save people.

1182
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:12,261
I thought that's what you do,
is you save people's lives.

1183
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:14,805
You're-- You're just gonna let me die.

1184
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:18,267
- I'm trying to protect you right now.
- No. No, you are not.

1185
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:20,936
You're trying to protect yourself.

1186
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:25,732
Look, we just need a bit more time...

1187
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:28,183
- ...to figure out something else.
- I do not have time!

1188
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:36,577
I'm sorry.

1189
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,921
You're a fraud, Spider-Man!

1190
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,438
-Hey! Hi.

1191
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:07,608
- Hi, I gotta talk to you for a second.
- I'm running late right now.

1192
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:10,444
- It's just gonna take a second.
- I can't. I'm sorry, Peter.

1193
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:13,989
Just give me one minute. I just
wanna say one thing and I'm gone.

1194
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,200
Everything's a mess.
Everything's insane.

1195
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:19,036
My dad, my mom.
Everything I thought about them? Lies.

1196
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:21,830
Lies. Lies, lies, lies.
Nothing makes any sense anymore.

1197
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,960
I gotta figure out what I'm gonna do
with Harry.

1198
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:25,626
Of course I wanna save him.
You know?

1199
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:27,516
I wanna save him
because he's my best pal.

1200
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:30,589
And what if my blood works?
But what if it doesn't?

1201
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,341
I don't know. I got no idea.

1202
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:36,845
- Oh, God.
- I got nothing. I got nothing.

1203
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,848
The only thing I keep
coming back to, Gwen, is...

1204
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:42,643
Ms. Stacy?

1205
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:44,436
Shall I take you upstairs?

1206
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:47,064
Yes. I'm so sorry.

1207
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:51,485
I'm so sorry. I'm already late.
Can I have just one more minute?

1208
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,529
- Okay.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

1209
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:56,949
- I'm-- Okay. I have to be--
- Where are we?

1210
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,575
I'm at my...

1211
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:01,995
...last interview for Oxford
right now.

1212
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:05,874
- Oxford. I didn't know.
- Yeah.

1213
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:08,418
Okay, well...

1214
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:10,546
I'm sorry to bother you...

1215
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:12,381
...my fair lady-- Madam.

1216
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:14,383
But who am I?

1217
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:16,176
I mean, who am I? I'm John Hopkins.

1218
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:18,470
I'm one of the young professors
at Harvard...

1219
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,682
...and I've been trying to get her
to be in my...

1220
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:24,643
Be a part of my team for a while now.

1221
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:27,813
And she's just the best person I know
and a scientific genius.

1222
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,064
And...

1223
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,732
Anyway, God save the queen.

1224
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:33,002
- I'm sorry everything's happening--
- Can you wait?

1225
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:34,528
Peter. Peter.

1226
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,363
What do you want to say to me?

1227
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:38,657
What's the "one thing"?

1228
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:44,580
I have to go to England, Peter.

1229
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:47,958
It's important to me.

1230
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:55,966
I mean, I don't know. Maybe
we're on different paths right now.

1231
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:58,719
You know? I don't know.

1232
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:00,304
Maybe we're just...

1233
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:02,347
...going different ways. I don't--

1234
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:04,683
I've gotta go. I gotta go.

1235
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,103
Gwen.

1236
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,108
Good luck.

1237
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:18,947
Hi. Sorry.

1238
01:26:19,132 --> 01:26:22,469
He took the D train every morning
at 7 to work.

1239
01:26:22,969 --> 01:26:25,514
Came home at 6:00 every evening.

1240
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:35,023
"Roosevelt's secret station.

1241
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:37,651
Track 61, a secret
subterranean extension...

1242
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:40,612
...of New York's D Line train
under Pershing Square...

1243
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:44,491
...built to transport President Franklin
Roosevelt away from the public eye...

1244
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:48,161
...to keep his polio hidden
from the American people.”

1245
01:26:58,338 --> 01:26:59,631
Mr. Osborn?

1246
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:02,509
You all right?

1247
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:05,262
Is there anything I can get you?

1248
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:08,515
No, not unless you can
bring those spiders back to life.

1249
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:10,225
Spiders?

1250
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:12,436
The ones that they destroyed...

1251
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:16,773
..."to restore investor confidence."

1252
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:19,985
Go home, Felicia.

1253
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:21,528
Take the day off.

1254
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:24,906
Harry.

1255
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:30,829
I think there may be another way
to get what you're looking for.

1256
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:37,461
I overheard Menken talking
with one of our security heads.

1257
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:40,338
Before they destroyed the spiders...

1258
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:42,924
...they had the venom extracted.

1259
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:46,720
What?

1260
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:50,432
What are you saying?

1261
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:52,562
That way, they could comply
with the lawsuits...

1262
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:55,604
...but still keep the data
in case it ever became useful.

1263
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:57,981
Where is it?

1264
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:00,150
It's somewhere in the building.

1265
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:05,197
It's somewhere off-books
called "Special Projects."

1266
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:09,034
Special Projects.

1267

1272
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:31,139

01:28:42,943 --> 01:28:44,903
A world without power.

1278
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:46,363
A world...

1279
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:48,281
...without Spider-Man.

1280
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:49,950
Warning:

1281
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,202
Your user access has been revoked.

1282
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:55,288
He's busy. You can't go in there.
He's busy.

1283
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:57,541
What did you do?

1284
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:00,210
The more relevant question is
what did you do?

1285
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:04,506
An employee is killed and in your
first action as CEO, you cover it up.

1286
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:09,135
No, you covered it up. Then you buried
him in the bug house using my name.

1287
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:13,181
Ravencroft is a timeworn institution
devoted to mental improvement.

1288
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:15,350
You are experimenting
on people in there.

1289
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,769
Progress has its stepping stones.

1290
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:20,814
Now, in light of your deceptive
criminal actions, you've been--

1291
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:22,649
How do I put this gently?

1292
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:23,900
--fired.

1293
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:27,279
You are not going to bury me too.

1294
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:30,198
Looks to me like you're
halfway in the ground already.

1295
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:32,617
It's only a matter of time.

1296
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,537
You're going to die a horrible death.

1297
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:37,539
Like your father.

1298
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,749
The difference is...

1299
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,085
...no one is going to miss you.

1300
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,131
Get him out.

1301
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:47,382
Wait. Wait.

1302
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:56,391
I know my way out.

1303
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:08,670
A hundred dollars.
Can you believe that?

1304
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:11,072
Tell you why, you should
put the lid on that but quick.

1305
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:12,657
I tried. Good luck.

1306
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:15,708
You should tell her to come down here
and find one of those alligators.

1307
01:32:39,929 --> 01:32:41,139
Test.

1308
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:43,475
My name is Richard Parker.

1309
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:45,829
Whatever lies will be told about me...

1310
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:47,937
...I would like the world
to know the truth.

1311
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:52,150
Oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research...

1312
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:57,238
...when Norman Osborn made a deal
with a foreign military organization...

1313
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:59,991
...to continue funding my research.

1314
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:02,619
And I discovered what
they were going to use it for.

1315
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:05,413
Weapons. Biological weapons,
of course.

1316
01:33:05,663 --> 01:33:06,998
So I refused.

1317
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:10,376
And now, to eliminate me
from the picture...

1318
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:14,506
...Norman Osborn has
falsified evidence against me...

1319
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:18,259
...in order to take control
of my work.

1320
01:33:21,763 --> 01:33:23,014
Can I help you?

1321
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:25,558
Yeah, you can open the gate.

1322
01:33:25,809 --> 01:33:27,102
I'm Harry Osborn.

1323
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:31,356
Now, there's a patient in that
Isolation Wing that I need to see.

1324
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:34,484
Joe, this is Mr. Osborn of Oscorp.

1325
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:37,334
Sorry, without a yellow badge,
I can't let anyone past this point.

1326
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:43,451
But it doesn't matter
because there's something else...

1327
01:33:44,494 --> 01:33:46,287
...that Norman doesn't know.

1328
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:49,499
The human DNA...

1329
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:52,627
...that I implanted in the spiders...

1330
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:55,630
...was my own.

1331
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:00,426
Which means that without me...

1332
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:02,345
...without my bloodline...

1333
01:34:03,012 --> 01:34:07,225
...Oscorp can never replicate
or continue my experiments.

1334
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:10,019
Keep Electro incubated...

1335
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:14,440
...with 400 milligrams of sodium
thiopental und phenobarbital.

1336
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:20,405
I have destroyed as much as possible
from the archives.

1337
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:22,615
But I didn't have time
to kill all of the spiders.

1338
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:26,077
So as a scientist,
my choice is very clear now.

1339
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:30,123
I have to disappear. I have to get
as far away from here as I can.

1340
01:34:30,373 --> 01:34:32,167
But as a father...

1341
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:35,670
...it means I may not
see my boy again.

1342
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:40,008
And nothing is as important to me...

1343
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:42,760
...as my son, Peter.

1344
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:44,888
Nothing in this world.

1345
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:47,473
But I have a responsibility...

1346
01:34:47,724 --> 01:34:49,767
...to protect the world
from what I've created...

1347
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:52,979
...and to protect him from
what I know Osborn is capable of.

1348
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:56,232
People will say I am a monster...

1349
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:58,818
...for what I've done.

1350
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:02,030
And maybe they're right.

1351
01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:06,910
I always thought that I'd have more...

1352
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,244
...time.

1353
01:35:08,494 --> 01:35:10,371
Dad? Dad!

1354
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:11,915
I'm sorry.

1355
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:32,435
Sedation off.

1356
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:41,361
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1357
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,780
All right?
But we don't have much time.

1358
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:45,698
Who are you?

1359
01:35:45,949 --> 01:35:49,077
I'm Harry Osborn.
I wanna make you a deal.

1360
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,121
I should kill you.

1361
01:35:52,372 --> 01:35:54,082
Oh, come on.

1362
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,501
Think bigger, Max.

1363
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:58,753
I'm not the one you want.

1364
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:00,296
You want Spider-Man.

1365
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:03,633
And I can give him to you.

1366
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:08,554
But I need something first.

1367
01:36:09,931 --> 01:36:12,141
I need you to get me into Oscorp.

1368
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,018
Get you in?

1369
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:15,937
You own it.

1370
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:18,189
Not anymore.

1371
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:19,691
Oscorp betrayed us both...

1372
01:36:19,941 --> 01:36:23,778
...so I can't get in there without you
and you can't get out of here without me.

1373
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:27,323
- What's happening?
- Someone pulled an alarm in the Iso Unit.

1374
01:36:27,573 --> 01:36:30,118
Get a containment team up there now.

1375
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:32,495
You couldn't possibly know
what I want.

1376
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:34,455
You submitted the design for the grid...

1377
01:36:34,706 --> 01:36:36,582
...and they stole it.
And now you want it back.

1378
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,626
You just wanna take back
what's yours.

1379
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:41,587
- How?
- It is all the power in the city, Max...

1380
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:43,756
...and it's right at your fingertips.

1381
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:45,800
And then once you shut down
the grid...

1382
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:49,971
...Spider-Man will come to you,
and I want you to make him bleed.

1383
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:52,974
Break it! Break it!

1384
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,645
Max, we don't have much time!

1385
01:36:57,895 --> 01:37:00,231
Go! Go, go! Go!

1386
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:02,525
Give me one reason
why I should trust you.

1387
01:37:02,775 --> 01:37:03,818
Because I need you!

1388
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:06,738
You need me?

1389
01:37:06,988 --> 01:37:09,907
Yes. I need you.

1390
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:14,287
You are my only chance
that I have at surviving.

1391
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:15,537
You need me?

1392
01:37:15,705 --> 01:37:17,623
Yes. I need you.

1393
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:19,876
I need you. Please! Please!

1394
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:22,795
Please!

1395
01:37:23,129 --> 01:37:25,006
I know what it's like to be thrown away!

1396
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:26,257
Please, Max!

1397
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:28,426
I need you! I need you!

1398
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:19,852
No!

1399
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:25,525
You wanna be my friend?

1400
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:28,361
I thought we were already friends.

1401
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:31,406
I had a friend once.

1402
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:34,242
It didn't work out.

1403
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,452
Yeah. Me too.

1404
01:38:37,954 --> 01:38:40,039
Then let's go catch a spider.

1405
01:38:43,459 --> 01:38:45,962
You have one new voice message.

1406
01:38:48,256 --> 01:38:50,049
Hi, Peter, it's me.

1407
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:54,971
I got in to Oxford.

1408
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:59,058
It's very exciting.

1409
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:02,895
I came by your house a little bit ago
and I...

1410
01:39:03,521 --> 01:39:04,564
You weren't there...

1411
01:39:04,814 --> 01:39:08,192
...and so I'm on my way
to the airport right now...

1412
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:11,123
...because there's this early
summer class that I found out about...

1413
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:14,449
...and I thought that
it would somehow...

1414
01:39:14,824 --> 01:39:18,828
...be easier, I guess, this way.

1415
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:22,832
I think that maybe it's time...

1416
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:25,251
...to let this go.

1417
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:28,212
And that's not because
I don't love you.

1418
01:39:28,463 --> 01:39:31,757
It's actually because I do, so...

1419
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:33,759
Okay, bye.

1420
01:39:48,274 --> 01:39:50,693
- We have to move, now.
- Why? What's happened?

1421
01:40:03,623 --> 01:40:05,249
Remember me?

1422
01:40:09,629 --> 01:40:10,963
Oh, my, oh, my.

1423
01:40:11,214 --> 01:40:13,174
How the tables have turned.

1424
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:16,135
I know it's hard to admit...

1425
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:20,723
...but how spectacular a move is this?

1426
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:24,560
- Am I right?
- Right as rain.

1427
01:40:26,187 --> 01:40:28,814
Okay, so, Fairy Godmother...

1428
01:40:29,065 --> 01:40:31,859
...it is time to grant me a wish.

1429
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:36,322
- I want in to Special--
- How dare you come back in here?

1430
01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:40,993
You recalcitrant, unworthy, defective...

1431
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:43,204
...urchin freaks.

1432
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:50,962
Oh, God, I'm sorry. That's just not
the answer we were looking for.

1433
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,643
Clear.

1434
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:10,022
Welcome back to the bonus round.

1435
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:14,944
Hey, let's take a walk, shall we?

1436
01:41:19,282 --> 01:41:22,118
The grid is all yours.

1437
01:41:54,358 --> 01:41:56,819
The spider venom. Give it to me.

1438
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:04,243
What is all this stuff?

1439
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:05,995
The future.

1440
01:42:19,759 --> 01:42:20,968
Load one up.

1441
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,807
It won't work.

1442
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:30,728
We ran every diagnostic test
apart from human trials.

1443
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:34,940
You've actually already run human trials.
You're just too stupid to know it.

1444
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:41,030
Do it. Now.

1445
01:43:00,675 --> 01:43:03,177
You had it all this time.

1446
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:33,768
It's Spider-Man.

1447
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:40,858
Stop the cab.

1448
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:43,152
Lady, I ain't even moving.

1449
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:15,309
- Hi.
- Hi.

1450
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:17,770
- Did you get my message?
- What message?

1451
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,689
- The message right there.
- Oh, that. That was you?

1452
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,733
- Don't do that.
- I couldn't make it out.

1453
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:25,110
I'll tell you what it says.
Says, "I love you."

1454
01:45:26,779 --> 01:45:28,489
Because I love you.

1455
01:45:29,532 --> 01:45:31,951
- And no offense, but you're wrong.
- I'm wrong about what?

1456
01:45:32,201 --> 01:45:34,041
You're wrong about
us being on different paths.

1457
01:45:34,286 --> 01:45:36,622
We're not on different paths.
You're my path.

1458
01:45:37,706 --> 01:45:39,875
And you're always gonna be my path.

1459
01:45:40,835 --> 01:45:44,380
And I know there's a million reasons why
we shouldn't be together. I know that.

1460
01:45:44,713 --> 01:45:46,382
But I'm tired of them.

1461
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:51,303
I'm tired of every single one of them.

1462
01:45:51,804 --> 01:45:53,722
We've all gotta make a choice.

1463
01:45:55,641 --> 01:45:57,101
Right? Well, I choose you.

1464
01:45:59,728 --> 01:46:00,980
So...

1465
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:02,773
...here's my thought.

1466
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,734
England.

1467
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:08,404
Both of us.

1468
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:11,866
I'm following you now.

1469
01:46:12,408 --> 01:46:14,243
I'm just gonna follow you everywhere.

1470
01:46:14,827 --> 01:46:16,787
I'm just gonna follow you
the rest of my life.

1471
01:46:17,955 --> 01:46:21,166
I mean, they got crime there
in England.

1472
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:23,097
- Yeah.
- They got tons of crime, it seems.

1473
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:25,254
- Tons.
- They got...

1474
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:27,464
...Jack the Ripper.

1475
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:29,300
What?

1476
01:46:29,550 --> 01:46:32,094
They haven't caught Jack the Ripper
yet. You didn't know that?

1477
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:53,324
What the hell is that?

1478
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:05,502
Is that Max?

1479
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:08,339
He must have cut the power
to the whole city.

1480
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:18,641
PNA 322, you are--

1481
01:47:19,016 --> 01:47:21,060
- I'm black.
- I have nothing.

1482
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:23,646
Hey, I need Tech Ops up here
right now.

1483
01:47:23,896 --> 01:47:26,398
The phones are down. Somebody
go down and grab Tech Ops.

1484
01:47:26,774 --> 01:47:28,567
Hey, write down
what you remember, people.

1485
01:47:28,817 --> 01:47:32,571
There's gotta be some kind of blackout
plan, right? Some kind of backup?

1486
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:35,658
There's an emergency reset
at the power plant.

1487
01:47:35,908 --> 01:47:38,748
If he cuts the transmission lines,
they're never gonna get this back up.

1488
01:47:38,994 --> 01:47:41,755
How will I stop him? Every time
I get close, he fries my web shooters.

1489
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:43,954
- Have you tried grounding them?
- Tried everything.

1490
01:47:44,124 --> 01:47:46,168
- Rubber, plastic--
- Did you try magnetizing them?

1491
01:47:46,418 --> 01:47:48,879
I didn't try magnetizing them.

1492
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:51,298
Okay, well, remember
8th grade science class?

1493
01:47:51,966 --> 01:47:54,593
If you magnetize a nail with a battery...

1494
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:56,887
- It holds an electric charge.
- Yes.

1495
01:47:59,264 --> 01:48:02,476
New York Approach.
This is Pan National 273 on approach.

1496
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:04,019
How do you hear?

1497
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:06,355
Approach, do you copy?

1498
01:48:06,605 --> 01:48:08,565
Radio's working. It's not us.

1499
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:20,160
Do not panic. Everyone,
please return to your vehicles.

1500
01:48:20,411 --> 01:48:22,287
Go back to your cars.

1501
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:23,956
Remain calm.

1502
01:48:25,416 --> 01:48:28,002
Do not panic.
Everyone return to your vehicles.

1503
01:48:28,252 --> 01:48:29,712
- Go into your homes.
- Officer!

1504
01:48:30,129 --> 01:48:31,255
Spider-Man!

1505
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:33,757
My father was Captain George Stacy
of the 19th Precinct.

1506
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:36,760
- Knew who he was. What can we do?
- Jumper cables.

1507
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:39,138
- Jumper cables?
- Yes. And copper wire.

1508
01:48:39,388 --> 01:48:41,807
Am I talking louder
than I usually talk right now?!

1509
01:48:42,558 --> 01:48:43,559
Yes.

1510
01:48:44,393 --> 01:48:46,193
- Your suit'll ground you.
- All right, do it.

1511
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:52,693
Okay, good. Try, try, try.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1512
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:53,944
Okay, it works, good.

1513
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:55,874
That is why you were number two
at Midtown.

1514
01:48:56,113 --> 01:48:57,113
Rub it in. Okay.

1515
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:00,951
- I gotta go.
- I'm coming with you.

1516
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:03,037
- You're not coming with me.
- Yes, I am.

1517
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:04,647
- It's too dangerous.
- I'm coming.

1518
01:49:04,788 --> 01:49:07,207
I've seen the grid specs
and I know how to reset the system.

1519
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:11,420
- I'm coming with you! You need me!
- Okay, shut up. You're coming with me!

1520
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:12,921
Shut the thing.

1521
01:49:13,297 --> 01:49:15,049
Sorry. I love you. Don't hate me.

1522
01:49:16,842 --> 01:49:18,177
Peter!

1523
01:49:18,427 --> 01:49:20,262
We still don't have backup generators.

1524
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,889
Get me Engineering!

1525
01:49:22,264 --> 01:49:23,464
I need a respirator right now.

1526
01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:25,517
They're battery-operated. I'll get it.

1527
01:49:25,768 --> 01:49:26,935
Hang on.

1528
01:49:27,686 --> 01:49:28,729
Okay.

1529
01:49:51,543 --> 01:49:53,796
Do you see me now, Spider-Man?

1530
01:49:54,088 --> 01:49:57,341
It's time to meet our destiny.

1531
01:50:12,481 --> 01:50:14,921
Tower, we're experiencing
some kind of electrical disturbance.

1532
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:17,653
Instruments are going haywire.
Radar is down.

1533
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:20,322
We're flying blind out here.
Do you copy?

1534
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:27,371
Tower, repeat: We are standby only.
What is happening?

1535
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:30,874
Sir? There are two inbound flights
on intersecting paths.

1536
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:32,845
- Time to impact?
- Four and a half minutes.

1537
01:50:33,085 --> 01:50:34,211
Clock it right now.

1538
01:50:48,183 --> 01:50:50,352
You're too late, Spider-Man.

1539
01:50:50,686 --> 01:50:52,354
I designed this power grid.

1540
01:50:52,604 --> 01:50:54,189
Now I'm gonna take back...

1541
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:56,150
...what is rightfully mine.

1542
01:50:56,525 --> 01:50:58,694
I will control everything.

1543
01:50:58,944 --> 01:51:02,573
And I will be like a god to them.

1544
01:51:02,823 --> 01:51:04,116
A god named Sparkles?

1545
01:51:14,459 --> 01:51:15,752
Not this time.

1546
01:51:16,128 --> 01:51:18,589
Is that all you got? Come on!

1547
01:51:37,691 --> 01:51:38,859
Come on!

1548
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:44,323
You ready to give up?

1549
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:57,461
Oh, thank you, Gwen Stacy.

1550
01:52:08,138 --> 01:52:09,818
Just shake it off. It's just your bones...

1551
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:12,184
...and your muscles and your organs.

1552
01:52:15,854 --> 01:52:17,314
Oh, boy.

1553
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:25,697
I hate this song!

1554
01:52:46,677 --> 01:52:47,678
Spider-Man...

1555
01:52:48,095 --> 01:52:49,429
...bet you never saw this coming.

1556
01:52:57,104 --> 01:52:58,897
Really? You web me to a car?

1557
01:52:59,231 --> 01:53:00,524
What are you, a caveman?

1558
01:53:00,774 --> 01:53:01,984
You shouldn't be here.

1559
01:53:02,234 --> 01:53:04,820
You tie me up to go off to war?
I know how to help you!

1560
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:07,197
- What are you doing here?!
- I know the grid specs.

1561
01:53:07,447 --> 01:53:08,740
I can reset the system!

1562
01:53:08,991 --> 01:53:11,201
You can't be here right now.
I'm not messing around.

1563
01:53:11,451 --> 01:53:13,171
You can't be here right now.
This is insane.

1564
01:53:13,412 --> 01:53:16,373
Nobody makes my decisions for me.
All right? Nobody.

1565
01:53:16,623 --> 01:53:18,667
This is my choice, okay?

1566
01:53:19,376 --> 01:53:21,795
My choice. This is mine.

1567
01:53:22,087 --> 01:53:23,338
Now, how do we stop him?

1568
01:53:23,588 --> 01:53:25,966
Okay, so he's electric,
he's like a battery.

1569
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:27,884
What happens
if you overcharge a battery?

1570
01:53:28,135 --> 01:53:29,136
- It explodes.
- Right.

1571
01:53:29,386 --> 01:53:30,986
So we use his power against him.
Perfect.

1572
01:53:31,221 --> 01:53:33,181
- Okay.
- I think I can reconnect the power lines.

1573
01:53:33,307 --> 01:53:34,766
But I need you to reset the system.

1574
01:53:35,058 --> 01:53:37,894
Okay, when I say you turn
that power on, you turn it on.

1575
01:53:38,145 --> 01:53:40,480
- No matter what. No matter what.
- Peter.

1576
01:53:45,485 --> 01:53:46,820
Go, go!

1577
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:40,916
Sixty seconds to impact.

1578
01:55:15,534 --> 01:55:16,535
Now, Gwen, now!

1579
01:55:16,785 --> 01:55:17,911
Do it now!

1580
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:44,688
Uni 687--

1581
01:55:55,824 --> 01:55:58,618
This is LaGuardia Tower.
Turn immediately to heading 280.

1582
01:56:00,036 --> 01:56:02,330
You have incoming traffic. I repeat: 280.

1583
01:56:02,581 --> 01:56:03,874
Defend immediately.

1584
01:56:19,389 --> 01:56:20,390
Yes!

1585
01:56:21,016 --> 01:56:23,256
All right, people, back to work.
Let's land these planes.

1586
01:56:23,477 --> 01:56:24,853
I'll be back in a minute.

1587
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:27,647
Oh, thank God. All right!

1588
01:56:27,898 --> 01:56:29,941
All right, we're back.
Everyone, let's go.

1589
01:57:05,936 --> 01:57:07,729
I think we can still make your flight.

1590
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:17,697
Gwen, stay there.

1591
01:57:43,765 --> 01:57:45,183
Peter.

1592
01:57:46,101 --> 01:57:49,271
When you said Spider-Man said no...

1593
01:57:49,771 --> 01:57:53,817
...you meant you said no.

1594
01:57:54,067 --> 01:57:56,486
Harry, what did you do?

1595
01:57:56,736 --> 01:57:58,738
What you made me do.

1596
01:57:59,281 --> 01:58:00,782
You were my friend...

1597
01:58:01,032 --> 01:58:03,577
...and you betrayed me!

1598
01:58:03,868 --> 01:58:04,995
No.

1599
01:58:05,453 --> 01:58:07,372
I was trying to protect you.

1600
01:58:08,123 --> 01:58:09,374
Look at me.

1601
01:58:09,624 --> 01:58:11,710
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
This is gonna be all right.

1602
01:58:12,127 --> 01:58:13,378
You don't give people hope.

1603
01:58:14,087 --> 01:58:15,630
You take it away.

1604
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:16,923
No, Harry.

1605
01:58:17,507 --> 01:58:19,467
I'm gonna take away yours.

1606
01:58:19,718 --> 01:58:20,969
No. Gwen, run!

1607
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:22,679
Harry!

1608
01:58:23,305 --> 01:58:24,639
Harry, put her down!

1609
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:43,366
Harry, stop this right now!

1610
01:58:43,617 --> 01:58:46,328
This isn't you, Harry. This is not you.
Harry, put her down.

1611
01:58:46,911 --> 01:58:48,830
- Harry.
- Harry is dead!

1612
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:52,042
Harry, this is between you and me.
You wanna fight?

1613
01:58:52,292 --> 01:58:54,336
Fight me! Let her go!

1614
01:58:54,878 --> 01:58:56,004
Okay.

1615
01:58:57,213 --> 01:58:58,213
No!

1616
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:07,349
You okay?

1617
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:14,981
I got you, Gwen. I'm gonna
put you down right here.

1618
02:00:35,228 --> 02:00:36,228
Peter?

1619
02:01:39,876 --> 02:01:42,086
Hey. Hey.

1620
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:46,382
Gwen?

1621
02:01:49,052 --> 02:01:50,053
Hey.

1622
02:01:50,428 --> 02:01:51,554
Hey!

1623
02:01:56,392 --> 02:01:57,477
Gwen?

1624
02:01:59,521 --> 02:02:00,522
Hey.

1625
02:02:04,067 --> 02:02:05,109
Breathe.

1626
02:02:06,653 --> 02:02:08,571
Hey, Gwen.

1627
02:02:09,572 --> 02:02:10,573
Hey.

1628
02:02:14,327 --> 02:02:15,370
Hey.

1629
02:02:17,789 --> 02:02:19,082
You're okay.

1630
02:02:22,836 --> 02:02:23,920
Gwen?

1631
02:02:29,843 --> 02:02:31,344
Stay with me, stay with me.

1632
02:02:31,594 --> 02:02:33,972
Stay with me, stay with me.
You stay with me.

1633
02:02:39,727 --> 02:02:40,812
Gwen.

1634
02:02:43,523 --> 02:02:44,566
Gwen!

1635
02:02:47,569 --> 02:02:50,113
No, please, please.

1636
02:02:52,657 --> 02:02:54,033
Please.

1637
02:03:00,915 --> 02:03:03,167
I can't do this without you.

1638
02:05:05,832 --> 02:05:07,250
Leave us.

1639
02:05:11,546 --> 02:05:13,131
You've made progress.

1640
02:05:13,381 --> 02:05:16,592
I've identified several
worthy candidates.

1641
02:05:16,843 --> 02:05:18,928
Now that Spider-Man's gone...

1642
02:05:19,178 --> 02:05:22,223
...this city will never be the same.

1643
02:05:22,473 --> 02:05:25,018
Oh, I'm counting on that.

1644
02:05:25,268 --> 02:05:26,853
Speaking of progress...

1645
02:05:27,103 --> 02:05:28,146
...you're looking better.

1646
02:05:29,105 --> 02:05:30,940
It comes and goes.

1647
02:05:32,650 --> 02:05:34,110
Tell me more.

1648
02:05:34,694 --> 02:05:36,237
How many men did you have in mind?

1649
02:05:36,487 --> 02:05:38,489
I wanna keep it small.

1650
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:42,160
Everything you need
is already at Oscorp.

1651
02:05:44,037 --> 02:05:45,580
Access granted.

1652
02:05:45,830 --> 02:05:47,749
Welcome, Mr. Fiers.

1653
02:05:48,041 --> 02:05:49,751
Who's our first volunteer?

1654
02:05:50,001 --> 02:05:51,794
Aleksei Sytsevich.

1655
02:05:52,045 --> 02:05:54,213
Currently serving a life sentence.

1656
02:05:54,464 --> 02:05:55,673
He is...

1657
02:05:55,923 --> 02:05:58,176
...most eager to join us.

1658
02:05:59,010 --> 02:06:00,303
Good.

1659
02:06:00,970 --> 02:06:02,972
Start with him.

1660
02:06:03,473 --> 02:06:05,016
Russian gangster Aleksei Sytsevich...

1661
02:06:05,266 --> 02:06:07,186
...was broken out of
a classified penitentiary...

1662
02:06:07,435 --> 02:06:10,605
...known simply as the Vault
by an unknown team of men.

1663
02:06:10,855 --> 02:06:13,274
It's yet another example
of increased criminal activity...

1664
02:06:13,524 --> 02:06:16,694
...since the disappearance
of Spider-Man five months ago.

1665
02:06:16,944 --> 02:06:20,198
The web-stinger's absence has left
a hole in the heart of the city.

1666
02:06:20,448 --> 02:06:23,034
Believe it or not, even the New
York City Police Department...

1667
02:06:23,284 --> 02:06:25,324
...has joined the chorus
of New Yorkers in hoping...

1668
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:27,622
...for the return of the web-stinger.

1669
02:06:27,872 --> 02:06:30,041
The entire world seems to be
asking the same question:

1670
02:06:30,708 --> 02:06:32,794
Where is Spider-Man?

1671
02:06:34,087 --> 02:06:36,506
Too bad about that spider guy.

1672
02:06:38,049 --> 02:06:40,927
Too bad he's disappeared.
Seems like everybody really needs him.

1673
02:06:42,929 --> 02:06:44,222
Where you going?

1674
02:06:45,431 --> 02:06:48,101
- Eat my cereal.
- Peter.

1675
02:06:48,518 --> 02:06:50,186
Where you going?

1676
02:07:00,154 --> 02:07:01,197
I don't know.

1677
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:05,159
You know, it's so funny.
I've been--

1678
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:08,746
I've been trying to clean up
around here, get organized...

1679
02:07:09,163 --> 02:07:13,376
...and been putting
some of Ben's stuff in boxes.

1680
02:07:14,168 --> 02:07:17,880
And it's so funny, the heavier
the box gets, the lighter I feel.

1681
02:07:18,631 --> 02:07:20,675
- You're throwing his stuff away?
- No.

1682
02:07:20,925 --> 02:07:22,135
No. God, no.

1683
02:07:22,510 --> 02:07:25,638
I couldn't do that. It's part of me.

1684
02:07:26,514 --> 02:07:29,475
I'm just finding...

1685
02:07:30,434 --> 02:07:31,894
...a better place for it.

1686
02:07:35,648 --> 02:07:37,567
I'm gonna take one last look...

1687
02:07:39,026 --> 02:07:40,653
...and I'm gonna put it
where it belongs.

1688
02:08:05,928 --> 02:08:10,141
It's easy to feel hopeful
on a beautiful day like today.

1689
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:14,228
But there will be dark days
ahead of us too.

1690
02:08:15,062 --> 02:08:17,607
There will be days
where you feel all alone.

1691
02:08:20,151 --> 02:08:22,570
And that's when hope is needed most.

1692
02:08:24,030 --> 02:08:26,073
No matter how buried it gets...

1693
02:08:26,908 --> 02:08:28,993
...or how lost you feel...

1694
02:08:29,243 --> 02:08:30,953
...you must promise me...

1695
02:08:31,204 --> 02:08:34,540
...that you will hold on to hope.

1696
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:37,501
Keep it alive.

1697
02:08:38,419 --> 02:08:41,047
We have to be greater
than what we suffer.

1698
02:08:41,297 --> 02:08:42,757
My wish for you...

1699
02:08:43,007 --> 02:08:45,134
...is to become hope.

1700
02:08:45,593 --> 02:08:47,053
People need that.

1701
02:08:48,387 --> 02:08:50,348
And even if we fail...

1702
02:08:50,723 --> 02:08:52,767
...what better way is there to live?

1703
02:08:54,352 --> 02:08:56,103
As we look around here today...

1704
02:08:56,479 --> 02:08:59,690
...at all of the people
who helped make us who we are...

1705
02:09:00,399 --> 02:09:02,818
...I know it feels like
we're saying goodbye.

1706
02:09:03,361 --> 02:09:06,030
But we will carry
a piece of each other...

1707
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:09,033
...Into everything that we do next...

1708
02:09:10,701 --> 02:09:13,704
...to remind us of who we are...

1709
02:09:15,581 --> 02:09:17,375
...and of who we're meant to be.

1710
02:09:19,669 --> 02:09:21,837
I've had a great four years with you.

1711
02:09:22,088 --> 02:09:24,090
I'll miss you all very much.

1712
02:09:46,487 --> 02:09:47,571
Let's go! Move it.

1713
02:09:55,955 --> 02:09:57,415
Get down! Take cover!

1714
02:10:01,252 --> 02:10:05,548
I'm here live on Park Avenue and
56th Street where it is complete chaos.

1715
02:10:05,798 --> 02:10:08,009
A man in some sort of
weaponized armored suit...

1716
02:10:08,259 --> 02:10:09,677
...is wreaking havoc on Midtown.

1717
02:10:13,723 --> 02:10:16,350
I am the Rhino!

1718
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:19,020
I told you I would be back!

1719
02:10:30,281 --> 02:10:32,408
- No! No!
- A kid!

1720
02:10:37,621 --> 02:10:38,621
Hold your fire!

1721
02:10:38,998 --> 02:10:40,624
Everybody, hold your fire.

1722
02:10:41,459 --> 02:10:44,545
- Unit 2, stand down. Stand down.
- Civilian in our line of sight.

1723
02:10:48,507 --> 02:10:49,550
Kid! You gotta get--

1724
02:10:51,719 --> 02:10:53,512
Look, New York!

1725
02:10:53,763 --> 02:10:55,598
Spider-Man is back.

1726
02:10:56,182 --> 02:10:57,183
Leave the kid alone!

1727
02:10:57,433 --> 02:10:59,393
That's my baby! Please.

1728
02:11:02,438 --> 02:11:04,523
Brave boy.

1729
02:11:04,815 --> 02:11:07,151
Does Aleksei scare you, little boy?

1730
02:11:24,460 --> 02:11:25,961
Hey, Spider-Man.

1731
02:11:36,389 --> 02:11:37,681
I knew you'd come back.

1732
02:11:38,182 --> 02:11:40,518
Yeah. Thanks for stepping up for me.

1733
02:11:40,768 --> 02:11:42,853
You're the bravest kid I've ever seen.

1734
02:11:43,104 --> 02:11:45,824
I'm gonna take care of this jerk.
You go take care of your mom. Okay?

1735
02:11:46,065 --> 02:11:48,609
All right, get out of here. Go. Go.

1736
02:11:55,658 --> 02:11:56,826
You fight me?

1737
02:11:57,159 --> 02:11:59,203
You fight me now?

1738
02:12:00,246 --> 02:12:03,582
On behalf of the fine people of New
York City and real rhinos everywhere...

1739
02:12:03,833 --> 02:12:06,836
...I ask you to put
your mechanized paws in the air.

1740
02:12:07,086 --> 02:12:08,087
Never!

1741
02:12:08,337 --> 02:12:11,340
I crush you! I kill you! I destroy you!

1742
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:13,360
You want me to come down there
so you can kill me?

1743
02:12:13,384 --> 02:12:14,385
Yes!

1744
02:12:14,635 --> 02:12:15,845
I'll be right there.

1745
02:12:16,220 --> 02:12:18,013
