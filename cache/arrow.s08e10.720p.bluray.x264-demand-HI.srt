with Oliver and his mission.

He always said he would
go it alone

would never...

Jimmy Tarallo gave me

Right. Okay.
Um, and why did you time travel here?

00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,085
[sighs]
You doing okay?

164
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:23,337
When am I never
not okay?

165
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,756
I don't think any of us
are really okay,

166
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:29,260
but it seems to be hitting
you particularly hard.

167
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,345
I'm fine, like always.

168
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,472
You ready?

169
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,642
- Yeah. Let's do this.
- Yeah.

170
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,353
So what did Oliver
call this thing?

171
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,189
He called it
the Mark of Four.

172
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,316
[arm whirring]

173
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:46,277
So how you doing?

174
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,740
Uh, I'm just... I'm nervous
about the funeral.

175
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,490
Yeah.

176
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,452
[sighs] Yeah. You know,
Thea's gonna be there.

177
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:57,997
Imagine both of Oliver's
sisters would be there.

178
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:01,208
I kind of left Thea abruptly.

179
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,295
Ah. You're worried
about an awkward reunion.

180
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:06,047
I'm worried about
any kind of reunion.

181
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,067
[Dinah] Well, hey.
Look at it this way.

182
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,134
After fighting
the Mirakuru soldiers

183
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:11,886
and the Thanatos Guild,

184
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:14,138
seeing your ex-girlfriend
should be cake.

185
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:15,639
That's why I'm scared.

186
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,144
I don't want her to
be my ex-girlfriend.

187
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,857
[Rene] So when's
Felicity get to town?

188
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,193
[sighs] I don't know
if she's coming.

189
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,403
It's her husband's
funeral, man.

190
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,410
Which is exactly why
I think she might miss it.

191
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:32,698
[melancholic music]

192
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:33,865
I don't know, Rene.

193
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:37,495
She has a nanny watching
Mia right now.

194
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,221
Felicity hasn't even
made it out of bed.

195
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,917
I have no idea
how to help her.

196
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,004
[John] At least bring me
for backup.

197
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,191
[Oliver] How many times
are we gonna go over this, Diggle?

198
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:50,935
You know, I went
through Byrne's financials.

199
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,444
Every month, he gives
over a million dollars

200
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:54,553
to this outfit
called Black Armada.

201
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,056
- You know who they are?
- Private security firm.

202
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:00,267
- Former special forces.
- That's right,

203
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,434
and you don't think
it's a good idea to bring

204
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,812
a former soldier
of your own?

205
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:04,813
No.

206
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:06,564
You know
what I think?

207
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:08,960
I don't think you
really want me there.

208
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,569
Oh. Thanks for finally
getting my point.

209
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,214
I don't think you want me there
because you're afraid

210
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:14,278
I will stop you from committing
cold-blooded murder.

211
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:15,908
[sighs]

212

[tense music]

213
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:23,115
You think that your role is to keep
the body count low.

214
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,610
There's a way you can stop him
tonight without killing him.

215
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,038
You could take him
to prison,

216
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,026
you could see that
justice is served.

217
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,006
The man traffics
in human beings.

218
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,261
- Killing him is justice.
- But at what cost?

219
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:37,531
You say your mission will never end.
Well, trust me,

220
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:40,307
it will end a lot sooner
if you lose who you are.

221
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,857
[keyboard clacking]

222
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,443
Mia?

223
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,918
Don't worry. The Monitor
didn't drop me off

224
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:57,533
because there's
another Crisis coming.

225
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:59,952
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

226
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:01,317
[Mia]
Laurel's sister showed up,

227
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,331
thought I might enjoy going to
my dad's funeral.

228
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,085
And what are you doing
with all this stuff?

229
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,630
Trying my best
to channel my mom.

230
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,843
Sorry. Um, when Sara
dropped me off,

231
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,179
she gave me this whole lecture
about not telling people

232
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,680
about the future,
so...

233
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,685
Few weeks before
Sara showed up...

234
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,022
something happened.

235
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:29,815
[dramatic music]

236
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,026
William!

237
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:37,489
Right in front of me.
I couldn't do anything to stop it, and...

238
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,703
I am already failing at being
the Green Arrow.

239
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,998
What we do is
not easy.

240
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,959
There are setbacks,
there are tragedies,

241
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,878
but, God, Mia,
your father,

242
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,673
he would be so,
so proud

243
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,801
of how you're carrying
all of that.

244
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,221
I can't even do
the one thing that

245
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,972
he risked his
entire life to do...

246
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:05,351
protect my family.

What's this?

249
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,790
Well, your mother's
Archer protocol scans

250

certain key words.

<i>William Clayton, the son of
the late hero Oliver Queen,</i>

- Hey.
- Hey.

262
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:51,939
Look. I'm sorry
about the way that I left.

263
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:53,106
I just...

264
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,067
Ollie's just passed away,

265
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:56,610
and William's been
kidnapped,

266
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,363
so... as far
as apologies go,

267
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,323
your timing's
a little not great.

268
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,618
[John] If you still think
Oliver's mission's finished,

269
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,675
tell that to William
when we get him back.

270
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,872
We will get him back,
but, John, William

271
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,874
was kidnapped outside
of Star City.

272
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,001
I'm sure that'll make him feel
a whole lot better.

273
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:15,838
- I reached out to Felicity.
- Yeah. Me, too.

274
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:17,047
Radio silence.

275
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:20,217
I asked Sara
to check on her.

Hey.

282
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,614
It's almost like a party.
[chuckles]

283
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,958
[Curtis] Um, I tried
running a quad-grid search task

284
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,185
to a keyhole satellite
array, but...

285
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,479
[Felicity] That array's dark-sided
as it undergoes a firmware upgrade,

286
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,503
but fortunately when
William moved to Central City,

287
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:01,717
his overbearing stepmom implanted
a subdermal tracking device into his arm.

288
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,552
Ethical... debatable.

289
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,179
Which went dark as soon as
he reentered Star City.

290
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,890
Well, that's
convenient at least.

Just one second as I work up
a statistically correlated list

of possible locations
he could be at.

- That is a very long list.

Which is exactly why
we called everyone.

295
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,097
[John] Thank you all
for coming,

296
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,737
some on very short notice.

[tense music]

298
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:25,476
Oliver made
the ultimate sacrifice

299
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,743
for his friends
and his family.

300
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,580
Now a part of his family
needs our help.

This is our
most important mission.

Okay. Well, he's not here.

00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,561
What was the next place
on Felicity's list?

306

Kord industries.

307
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,523
All right. Well, let's go.

Hey. Can I talk
to you for a second?

309
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,653
You already did
back at the bunker, okay? I...

310
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,947
I get it. You're sorry.

311
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:07,324
No. I never told
you why I left.

312
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:08,909
And you don't need to.

313
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,246
I understand.
You were going through a lot.

314
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:14,665
Dying, getting
resurrected,

315
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:18,377
it gave me a whole new perspective
on... on everything,

including you.

317
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:23,966
You know, I got
my whole life back,

318
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,093
and I realized that
I wanted you in it...

and always.

00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,018
And what does that mean?

322
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:36,436
[Roy]
It means...

323
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,189
will you marry me?

324
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,483
Uh...

325
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:47,823
[Rory, deep voice]
Get out.

326
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,616
[dramatic music]

327
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:51,452
Get out!

328
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,763
- What the hell is that thing?
- Get outta here!

329
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,622
- Come on. Let's go!
- Go, go, go, go!

330
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,332
Ahh.

331
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:02,087
Nice. I would have
fired some shots in the air.

332
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,839
My way's scarier.

333
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,759
So, how are things?

334
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,011
[men mumbling]

335
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,345
[Rene]
It's been a while.

336
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:15,142
Yeah. Well, a while
is what it took

337
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,060
for these rags
to work again.

338
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:20,439
Since then, I've been
fighting for justice.

339
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,191
To honor your father?

340
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:24,776
To honor Oliver.

341
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,197
[Rene] We've had our differences
over the years.

342
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:29,573
Yeah, I assumed.

343
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,074
Why?

344
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,245
Of everyone,

345
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,832
you're the most like him.

346
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:44,338
[dramatic music]

347
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,178

- Clear!

348
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:53,513
Damn it!

349
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:54,889
What?

350
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:56,724
He's not here.

351
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,369
[John] Curtis said there's
a bunch of places he could still be.

352
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,913
- Well, we need to find him.
- We will.

353
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,438
We have to find
him, Johnny.

354
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:02,898
We will, Lyla.
Are you okay?

355
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,943
Oliver put our family
back together.

356
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:08,445
What happens if...

357
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:12,074
if we can't do the same for his?

358
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:13,700
Lyla, look at me.
We can,

359
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,369
[tender music]

360
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,995
and we will, I promise.

361
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,414
[John]
We will.

[intense music]

363
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:34,262

[dramatic music]

367
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,322
I said, who are you?

368
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,866
You're wearing his hood.
You should know.

John Byrne...

392
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:07,267
you have failed this city.

[dramatic music]

Let him go!

395

I brought him up here
to throw him off.

396
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:18,320
My whole life ended
right here!

397
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:21,615
I don't care!
Final warning.

398
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,117
He thought he was
saving me.

399
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,787
eight years in Iron Heights
never saved anyone.

400
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,205
So you kidnap his son,

401
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,040
the man who spared
your life?

402
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,083
I should put this arrow
in you right now!

403
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,586
Do it! After eight years
in prison,

404
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:37,005
I got nothing left
to live for anyway!

405

Go ahead!

No.

408

Oliver Queen
didn't kill you,

409
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,192
then neither will I,

410
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,570
but your ass is going
back to prison.

411

This is the riser,

412
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:07,410
uh, this is the arrow shelf,

413
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:09,662
and this is the fadeout.

- That's really cool.

Must be a lot
to take in.

418
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:25,011
Yeah. That's the...

419
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:27,848
understatement
of the millennium.

420
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,141
She became a hero.

421
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,227
Well, she had
good parents.

422
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,816
Do you... you want
to meet her?

423
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,900
I don't know.

424
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,530
She... she might
be here,

425
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:46,116
but she's... she's
also at home,

426
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:49,995
waiting for me,

427
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:54,082
and I get to see
her grow up.

[tender music]

429

I'm not sure I want
to rush that.

430
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:07,220
- Hey.
- [Mia] Hey.

431
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:09,077
Something on the news
you should see.

432
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:10,139

Don't use
just your arms.

Power's coming

Thanks for the tip.

449
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,257
Just get real good
at that,

450
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:28,464
and maybe I'll eventually
take you out in the field.

[John] Byrne didn't really

Hmm.

00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,573
Plenty of people in this book that
deserve to die,

plain and simple,

457
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,495
probably not
everyone.

458
00:24:57,122 --> 00:25:00,041
Let's consider
Mr. John Byrne to be

459
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:03,086
proof of concept.

460
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,005
That people can be
redeemed?

[Roy] Your mom let me in.

Is it just me,
or does the new Moira

466
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,367
seem to like me a lot more than
the old Moira?

Yeah. She never really
liked you that much,

00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,498
but in her defense,
you were a criminal.

Well, I regret nothing.

471
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:43,793
If I never stole
your purse,

472
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,200
then I never
would have met you,

say no to my proposal,

which I... I really hope
you don't...

[tender music]

loving you has changed
my life, Thea.

477
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:59,267
If Ollie's death has
taught me anything, it's...

478
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:03,229
that we don't have a lot of time
in this life.

479
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,901
As long as you promise

480
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:10,070
if you ever freak out
on me like that again,

481
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:13,239
you tell me instead
of just leaving.

482
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,992
Yeah, yeah.
I... I can make that promise.

483
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:19,161
Then yes.

484
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:21,205
Yes?

485
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:24,084
I will marry you,
Roy Harper.

486
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,002

- [indistinct chatter]
- [phones ringing]

488
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:40,934
Hey. What are you
doing here?

489
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,142
Looking for you.

490
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,686
Well, I was just
looking for Dinah.

491
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:45,897
I think she's, uh,
ghosting me.

492
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,565
Do you have a second
to talk?

493
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:50,276
Want to step
into not my office?

494
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:59,327
So, uh, what's up?

495
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:01,746
It's about Oliver.

496
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,040
Well, not
exactly him, but...

497
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,710
who his sacrifice
brought back.

498
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:11,798
- Like me?
- And Tommy and Moira...

499
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:14,759
[melancholic music]

500
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:16,136
but not me

501
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:19,848
or the other
me, your...

502
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:22,975
your Laurel.

503
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,499
Look. We don't exactly
know the rules

504
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:25,841
of this whole
resurrection thing.

505
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:26,937
[Laurel]
Yes, we do.

506
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,023
You're all of
the people who Oliver

507
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,276
would have wanted
his sacrifice to bring back,

508
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,361
and Laurel, she...

509
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:37,052
she would have been
on that list, too,

510
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:39,492
if it wasn't for me.

511
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,997
Oliver's death, it
fixed everything else.

512
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,167
Why didn't it fix
this, too?

513
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:51,754
Because, sweetheart,
there is nothing about you

514
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:53,256
that needed
to be fixed.

515
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:01,597
[Lance]
All right.

516
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,437
[Rene]
Dig, what's going on?

517
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:14,611
[John]
The end of the line.

518
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:16,972
You were right.
The mission's over.

519
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:19,657
Just took me a while
to accept that.

520
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:23,762
I think accepting that
meant accepting

521
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:25,246
that Oliver is
really gone.

522
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:29,375
[somber music]

523
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:31,961
You know, Sara said
that before Oliver died

524
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,504
that he became
something else.

525
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:36,883
I'd like to think
that somehow, someway,

526
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:39,928
he's still here.

527
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:41,387
I'd drink to that.

528
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:43,681
Just as long as it's no more
of that God-awful vodka.

529
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:44,933
[both chuckle]

530
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:50,688
Okay. Cool. So...
you're moving on.

531
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:51,855
So what's next
for you?

532
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:54,108
Lyla accepted a promotion
in Metropolis, so...

533
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,087
we're all gonna move
there after the funeral.

534
00:28:57,111 --> 00:28:58,112
[soft dramatic music]

535
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,279
So am I.

536
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,200
I'm not gonna take
the promotion.

537
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:05,828
Just no point being police
in a safe city,

538
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:09,499
and there are lots
of cities that still need saving.

539
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:10,791
Damn.

540
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:14,128
And here I am getting
to be elected in a few months,

541
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:16,464
- and you guys decide to move away.
- [John snickers]

542
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:19,092
Kind of hard not to
take that personally.

543
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,095
[chuckling] Don't worry, Rene.
You are gonna be a great mayor

544
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,180
because you're
a great man.

545
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:26,015
I learned
from the best.

546
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:28,517
Oliver.

547
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:30,436
And the two
of you.

548

the lights?

00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:42,531
I will.

I'm gonna miss
this place.

00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:10,143
We all will.

[Lance]
Thank you for coming.

559
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:33,791
For a long time...

560
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:37,920
I hated Oliver Queen.

561
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:43,801
I blamed him for the death
of my youngest daughter,

562
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:48,890
I blamed him for the violence
in my city,

563
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:53,728
I interrogated him,
I hunted him,

564
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,272
persecuted him.

565
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,110
I've never been
more wrong in my life.

566
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:04,572
Oliver Queen wasn't just a hero.

567
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:07,492
[soft dramatic music]

568
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:08,993
He was a good man.

569
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:12,080
He was an honorable person.

570
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,221
The fact that he didn't
start out that way

571
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,834
makes him, in my book,

572
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:19,921
even more honorable.

573
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:24,092
He stands as a reminder
to all of us

574
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:26,928
that anyone can change.

575
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:32,683
So will this.

576
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:37,897

I just don't
understand.

580
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:18,563
If Ollie could
fix everything,

581
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,148
then why couldn't
he fix this?

[melancholic music]

583
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:26,362
I think that Oliver
could only change the things

584
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:28,072
that didn't change him,

585
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:31,159
and if not
for your father and...

586
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,829
[sighs]
what he did for Oliver,

587
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:39,792
your brother would never
have become the man that he was.

588
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:44,297
I still can't believe
Ollie's really gone.

589
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:46,424
I know, sweetheart.

590

[clears throat]
I'm sorry to intrude,

591
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:55,433
but I wanted to meet you.

592
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:57,643
- I'm...
- My sister.

593
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:00,104
Oliver told me a lot
about you.

594
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:01,981
I'm sorry that it took
something like this

595
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,148
for us to
finally meet.

596
00:33:03,274 --> 00:33:07,403
Yes. Emiko, you are
welcome here anytime.

597
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,070
Thank you.

598
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:15,995
So you're from
another Earth, is that it?

599
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,831
I know it's a lot
to take in.

600
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,643
Well, I just found out
there's a reality where I was dead,

601
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:24,170
so that's the curve I'm
grading on these days.

602
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:31,052
The Laurel of, well,
this Earth, um...

603
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:33,638
she was my wife.

604
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:38,059
So it must be
strange seeing me.

605
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:42,271
Ho! Yeah. Well, strange
enough to blow the curve...

606
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,442
but there's something
nice about it, too.

My condolences
on your husband's passing.

609
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,829
I had our marriage
erased.

610
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:01,582
Feelings cannot
be erased.

611
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,376
I had no feelings
for him.

612
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:06,045
Our marriage was
Father's perverse joke,

613
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:08,047
meant to torment me.

614
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:12,051
Our father only ever
meant for you to have a normal life.

615
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:15,012
I have lived a life
far more normal

616
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,973
than the one father
designed for me.

Hey. Thank you
for coming.

else I'd be.

Sara,

Oh. Hi.

- I'm...
- I know.

This morning,
you were teething,

629

and now you're...
I mean, wow.

630
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:03,811
Dad had a very similar
reaction when he first saw me.

631
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:07,189
You met your father.

632
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,026
[Mia]
Yeah. He trained me.

633
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,279
He taught me
to be a hero,

634
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:15,740
how to be like him.

635
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:18,200
I can tell you're
a lot like him.

I'm so sorry.

640
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:38,429
He was a good man.

641
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:41,474
I was there
at the end, and...

642
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:44,870
every day, I'm tortured
with the thought

643
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:45,978
that I could have
done more,

644
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,606
should have
done more.

645
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:52,943
No. You did everything
that you could, Barry.

646
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:54,362
How could you
know that?

647
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,614
Well, because,
you know, I know you.

648
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:01,242
I'm sorry.

649
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:06,123
- [whispering] Hey. Hey.
- [Felicity] Hey.

650
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:12,545
[quietly]
Felicity.

651
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:14,465
[Kara]
I'm so sorry.

652
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:17,259
There is no body
down there, no?

653
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:18,593
No.

654
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:20,721
We buried a casket
full of mementos.

655
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:23,599
Does anybody wanna say a few words?

656
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,976
I'm barely keeping it
together as it is.

657
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,788
I think that Oliver would
have been worried

658
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:29,855
that I'd say something
tactless anyway, so...

659
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:33,776
- I don't know what to say.
- Yeah.

660
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:38,864
Words seem...
meaningless. [sighs]

661
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,033
Hey.

662
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:44,954
Should be you.

663
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:56,549
[somber music]

664
00:36:58,509 --> 00:36:59,969
The Oliver that I met
eight years ago

665
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:02,680
is not the one that we say
good-bye to today.

666
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:08,269
Oliver always told me
that in order to save his city,

667
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:10,146
he had to become someone else,

668
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:11,939
he had to become
something else.

669
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:15,544
I always thought that meant
becoming the Green Arrow,

670
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:20,156
but... today, I realized
that meant becoming

671
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,241
a better man,

672
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,327
the best man he knew
how to be,

673
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:31,250
and he took all of us
with him on that journey.

674
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:33,961
He changed everything.

675
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:36,898
Oliver brought heroes
into the world,

676
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:37,882
he inspired heroes,

677
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:41,011
he inspired all of us here.

678
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:44,972
I was his brother,

679
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:50,770
and Oliver Queen...
was mine.

00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:09,663

[flames crackling]

704
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,237

706

even if it is
a little less bright

707
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:39,545

there is no return.

00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:01,317
I have waited
a very long time to see him.

712

I'm ready.

Hi.

718
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:20,229
Glad you could
finally make it.

719
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:33,659

This is so nice.

723
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:50,917
Not to complain.
I just thought

724
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,654
that the afterlife would
look a little less

725
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:53,804
like your old office.

726
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:56,849
It's my mom's office.

727
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:00,436
I wanted to be
where I first saw you.

728
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:04,189
Well, that would be
in the IT Department seven floors down.

729
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:06,357
You sure?

730
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:10,695
[Felicity] You're cute.

731
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,533
Too bad you're,
you know, dead,

732
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:18,037
which is obviously
a lot worse for you than it is for me.

733
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:20,831
It's a long story.

734
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:28,047
Lucky for us...

735
00:42:31,175 --> 00:42:32,360
we have all the time
in the world

736
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,719
for me to tell it
to you.
