I've seen good men go down purely

because someone didn't let us know
what we were walking into.

I've moved on to the next one,

You're aware that we've got

He thought he was working
on radiation resistance.

303

I would never have told him
what the project really was.

304
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:06,069
But he was so sure of what he was onto,
that he tested it on himself.

No, I'm a fighter.

put it in the body I had ten years ago,

00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,709
that would be someone
I wouldn't wanna fight.

Have you talked to her?

No. She doesn't know that I'm here.

She's with somebody?

He's a-- He's a head shrink.
They say he's one of the best.

What can I do to help you?

345
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:18,905
I could use a bed for a few nights.

346
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:21,825
Well, you can have
the spare room upstairs.

That'd be so great.

just go in there together and talk to him.

He told me what he wanted to do.

He wants it out of me.

He wants to dissect it

01:08:33,321 --> 01:08:37,242
No. No, that's the only thing
you have left from her. No.

667
01:08:39,244 --> 01:08:41,162
Well, we'll have to try and get it back.

668
01:08:42,747 --> 01:08:46,960
Federal is already monitoring phones,
plastic, and Dr. Ross's web account.

669
01:08:47,043 --> 01:08:49,170
And local PD have been placed on alert.

670
01:08:49,254 --> 01:08:52,048
They'll pop up somewhere.
And when they do, it comes straight to us.

671
01:08:52,132 --> 01:08:54,092
They're not gonna just pop up.

672
01:08:54,175 --> 01:08:57,262
He made it five years and got across
borders without making any mistakes.

673
01:08:57,345 --> 01:08:59,055
He's not gonna use a damn credit card now.

674
01:08:59,139 --> 01:09:01,224
<i>If he was trying to escape,</i>
<i>he'd be long gone.</i>

675
01:09:01,307 --> 01:09:03,685
<i>He's not trying to escape this time.</i>
<i>He's looking for help.</i>

676
01:09:03,768 --> 01:09:06,438
<i>And that's how we're gonna get him.</i>
<i>We know what they're after.</i>

677
01:09:06,521 --> 01:09:09,899
<i>And we know he's been talking to somebody.</i>
<i>You'll have copies of the correspondence.</i>

678
01:09:09,983 --> 01:09:12,193
<i>And the aliases Mr. Green and Mr. Blue</i>

679
01:09:12,277 --> 01:09:15,196

<i>to the S.H.I.E.L.D. operations database.</i>

680
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:19,367

<i>If he makes a peep, we'll hear him.</i>

681
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:22,620

What is it like?

[sighs]

688
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:26,393
When it happens, what do you experience?

689
01:10:27,477 --> 01:10:30,105
Do you remember those experiments
we volunteered for at Harvard?

690
01:10:30,188 --> 01:10:31,898
Those induced hallucinations?

691
01:10:33,024 --> 01:10:36,778
It's a lot like that,
just a thousand times amplified.

692
01:10:38,363 --> 01:10:41,449
It's like someone's poured
a liter of acid into my brain.

693
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:44,369
Do you remember anything?

694
01:10:44,452 --> 01:10:47,080
Just fragments, images.

695
01:10:47,163 --> 01:10:50,625
There's too much noise.
I can never derive anything out of it.

696
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:52,961
But then it's still you inside it.

697
01:10:53,044 --> 01:10:55,005
No. No, it's not.

698
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:01,094
I don't know. In the cave,
I really felt like it knew me.

699
01:11:01,678 --> 01:11:03,096
Maybe your mind is in there.

700
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:05,932
It's just overcharged
and can't process what's happening.

701
01:11:06,016 --> 01:11:09,060
I don't wanna control it.
I wanna get rid of it.

702
01:11:22,657 --> 01:11:25,827
-You ready?
-Let's even the playing field a little.

We gotta go. Walk toward the back.
Just don't move too fast.

01:12:07,702 --> 01:12:09,120
All right. Come on.

-Taxi!

710

[Betty] It is a long way uptown.
I think the subway's probably quickest.

711
01:12:28,306 --> 01:12:31,101
Me in a metal tube, deep underground,
with hundreds of people,

712
01:12:31,184 --> 01:12:32,936
in the most aggressive city in the world?

713
01:12:33,019 --> 01:12:34,979
Right. Let's get a cab.

-[hip-hop blaring on radio]

718
01:12:46,616 --> 01:12:49,077

What is wrong with you?

What's the matter, baby?
You don't like a good ride?

723
01:13:01,006 --> 01:13:02,465
Ugh!

-Excuse me. Dr. Sterns.
-Yes?

733
01:13:25,405 --> 01:13:27,365
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm Elizabeth Ross.

734
01:13:28,491 --> 01:13:30,243
Oh! Dr. Ross.

735
01:13:30,326 --> 01:13:32,245
I have someone who'd like to meet you.

736
01:13:32,328 --> 01:13:33,747
Okay.

737
01:13:36,207 --> 01:13:37,500
It's Mr. Blue, isn't it?

738
01:13:39,294 --> 01:13:40,587
Mr. Green?

739
01:13:42,839 --> 01:13:46,426
I've gotta tell you, I-- I've been
wondering if you were even real.

740
01:13:46,509 --> 01:13:48,219
And if you were, what would it look like?

741
01:13:48,303 --> 01:13:53,224
A person with that much power
lurking in him…

742
01:13:53,308 --> 01:13:57,854
Nothing could have surprised me more
than this unassuming man shaking my hand.

743
01:13:57,937 --> 01:14:00,648
But look, we're not strolling
into the park for a picnic here.

744
01:14:00,732 --> 01:14:02,484
Even if everything goes perfectly--

745
01:14:02,567 --> 01:14:06,571
if we induce an episode,
if we get the dosage exactly right--

746
01:14:07,322 --> 01:14:08,907
is that gonna be a lasting cure?

747
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:12,660
Or just some antidote
to suppress that specific flare-up?

748
01:14:12,744 --> 01:14:13,995
Uh… [snaps]

749
01:14:14,954 --> 01:14:15,955
I don't know.

750
01:14:17,248 --> 01:14:20,001
What I'm saying is that,
if we overshoot this

751
01:14:20,085 --> 01:14:22,712
by even the smallest integer,

752
01:14:22,796 --> 01:14:27,509
we're dealing with concentrations
with extraordinary levels of toxicity so--

753
01:14:27,592 --> 01:14:29,052
You mean it could kill him?

754
01:14:29,135 --> 01:14:30,261
Kill him? Yeah.

755
01:14:30,345 --> 01:14:32,389
[stammers] I should say so.

756
01:14:33,807 --> 01:14:36,017
You should know that there's
a flip side to this too.

757
01:14:36,101 --> 01:14:39,688
If we miss on the low side,
if we induce me and it fails,

758
01:14:39,771 --> 01:14:41,648
this will be very dangerous for you.

01:14:44,192 --> 01:14:47,946
Look, I've always been
more curious than cautious.

761
01:14:48,029 --> 01:14:49,989
And that's served me pretty well.

762
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:52,492
So, are we gonna do this?

That was the most extraordinary thing
I have seen in my entire life.

824
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:06,723
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.

825
01:20:06,806 --> 01:20:09,267
We need to go back and talk about
what just happened in there.

826
01:20:09,351 --> 01:20:12,562
Absolutely. Okay.
The gamma pulse came from the amygdala.

827
01:20:12,645 --> 01:20:15,148
-I think Dr. Ross's primer…
-Are you okay?

828
01:20:15,231 --> 01:20:18,151
…lets the cells absorb
the energy temporarily and then it abates.

829
01:20:18,234 --> 01:20:21,071
That's why you didn't die
of radiation sickness years ago.

830
01:20:21,154 --> 01:20:23,782
Now, maybe we've neutralized
those cells permanently,

831
01:20:23,865 --> 01:20:25,825
or maybe we just suppressed that event.

832
01:20:25,909 --> 01:20:28,161
I'm inclined to think the latter,
but it's hard to know,

833
01:20:28,244 --> 01:20:30,121
because none of our test subjects
ever survived.

834
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:32,582
-But they weren't getting the primer.
-Wait. What did you just say?

835
01:20:32,665 --> 01:20:35,460
-They weren't getting the primer.
-No, no. Test subjects?

836
01:20:36,753 --> 01:20:38,338
What test subjects?

837
01:20:39,589 --> 01:20:40,590

<i>so we had to go bigger.</i>

842
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:08,576
And we still don't know
which is more toxic:

843
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:09,953
the gamma or your blood.

844

Bruce, this is all you.

846
01:21:14,457 --> 01:21:18,545
You didn't send me much to work with,
so I had to concentrate it and make more.

847
01:21:18,628 --> 01:21:21,840
With a little more trial and error,
there's no end to what we can do.

848
01:21:21,923 --> 01:21:24,926
This is potentially Olympian.

This gamma technology
has limitless applications.

850

We'll unlock hundreds of cures.

851
01:21:31,599 --> 01:21:35,103
We will make humans impervious to disease.

No, no. We've gotta destroy it.

Wait. What?

854
01:21:51,745 --> 01:21:53,329
All of it, tonight.

855
01:21:53,413 --> 01:21:55,540
We're gonna incinerate it.
Is this the whole supply?

856
01:21:55,623 --> 01:21:58,335
What-- We could get the Nobel for this.

857
01:21:58,418 --> 01:22:00,545
You don't understand
the power of this thing.

858
01:22:00,628 --> 01:22:03,214
It is too dangerous.
It cannot be controlled.
