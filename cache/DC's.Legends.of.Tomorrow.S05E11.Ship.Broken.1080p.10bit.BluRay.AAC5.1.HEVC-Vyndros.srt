00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,758
[rock music playing on headphones]

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,970
-[Mick] Hey.
- I have Mace, jackass.

3
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:14,639
Oh, it's you.

4
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,435
Listen, uh, sorry I didn't make
your thing last week.

5
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,561
I was stuck in Hell.

6
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,563
Don't sweat it, I didn't miss you.

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,565
Right.

8
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,317
Your mom said I could have the weekend.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,944
Maybe we could bond, do stuff.

10
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,156
Come on, I'm trying.

11
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,913
All right, what is our father-daughter
weekend gonna look like?

12
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:41,750
I got tickets to the roller derby.
Should be lots of blood and cleavage.

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,378
I...I just remembered I actually
have a big history test on Monday,

14
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,130
so I can't. I gotta study.

15
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,133
Study. Mmm.

16
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,094
Very important, study. Yes.

17
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,471
Right.

18
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:55,972
[automatic lock chirps]

19
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,437
What's that?

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,314
- That's a time machine.
- Is this...

21
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,399
[whirring]

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,193
Can I see it?

23
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,028
I thought you had to study.

24
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,906
Uh, well, it could be useful
for a history test.

25
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,964
Basically, this bucket of bolts
can travel anywhere in history.

26
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:33,301
We can catch a show
with The Ramones or Sabbath.

27
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,179
- Some Lita Ford of The Runaways?
- That, too.

28
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,684
You know, I have been fighting so hard
to get you out of Hell

29
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,893
and you are finally here.

30
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,396
I bet you're the only one on this ship
who's happy to see me.

31
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,023
Oh, nonsense.
As far as this sorry lot are concerned,

32
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,693
as soon as anyone stops
trying to murder them on a weekly basis,

33
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,694
they're best friends.

34
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,571
Either way, I am gone
the second Charlie uses that Loom

35
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,365
-to bring my mom back.
- Yeah.

36
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,993
[Charlie chanting]

37
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,494
What's she doing?

38
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,997
She said she wanted to get
into the right headspace, so...

39
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,832
-[Agent Sharpe] Huh.
-[Zari] I totally get that.

40
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,626
There's nothing like a 20-second
meditation micro-sesh to zen out.

41
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,920
Did we miss the weaving?
I hope we didn't miss the weaving.

42
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,088
[dog vans]

43
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,507
- Whoa! Gary, what... You have a dog?
- What?

44
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,925
We don't have dogs.
This is not a dog place.

45
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,344
I have a letter from my therapist.

46
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,846
We don't have therapists either.

47
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,639
Well, we should.

48
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,392
Going to Hell
generated a lot of anxiety.

49
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,230
Well, this says
this is his emotional support animal.

50
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,732
- It's signed and everything.
- I don't have time for this.

51
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,608
I've named him Gary Junior.

52
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,611
- Oh! He's made a tiny tinkle.
- Ew.

53
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,904
He isn't ship-broken.

54
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,489
[Yaps]

55
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,825
Junior!

56
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,661
He's usually a very good boy.
Everyone, watch your step.

57
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,288
[Constantine] Oh!

58
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,624
Chasing tail now, are we, Gary?
That's a first. [chuckles]

59
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,169
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, don't--
- Ah, bollocks.

60
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,545
Gary!

61
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,715
[sighs] All right, almost ready.

62
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,884
I think. It's been a few millennia.

63
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,303
Okay, so, who's gonna
get the first weave?

64
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,429
-[Constantine] Her mother.
-[Zari] Behrad.

65
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,765
Behrad first, John.

66
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,600
Yeah, look, uh...

67
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,560
Well, I, uh...

68
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,021
I made a promise to Astra, love.

69
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,149
I'm with Zari.

70
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,109
Behrad.

71
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,652
Who's Behrad?

72
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,322
I did not come back from Hell
to take a number and wait my turn.

73
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,699
He is my brother and he's part
of the team that found the rings.

74
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:20,825
We're getting him back first.

75
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,244
Okay, stop, stop.
Everybody, stop arguing-

76
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,537
You're all gonna get a chance.

77
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,581
But Sara's in a coma.
Charlie's gonna weave her out first.

78
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,875
[all arguing]

79
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,544
All right, enough! Come on, guys.

80
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,547
This is exactly why I should have
left the damn thing broken.

81
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,300
Okay, I'm gonna choose. It's Behrad.

82
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,511
Now, goggles on, and let's get going.

83
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:50,980
Okay.

84
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,325
The ring of Clotho,
the maker of threads.

85
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,035
And extremely rad dresser.

86
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,958
The ring of Lachesis,

87
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,168
the weaver of destinies,

88
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,087
and a manipulative control freak.

89
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,258
And the ring of Atropos,

90
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,634
the cutter of threads,

91
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,469
and a heartless psychopath.

92
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,055
[Charlie chanting]

93
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,182
[rings chime]

94
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:38,862
[voices whispering]

95
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,168
I see Behrad's thread.

96
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,671
But it's a bit of a tangled mess.

97
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,548
It's probably
because of all the time travel,

98
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,925
but I think it'll be all right.

99
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,576
[electricity crackling]

100
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,348
[high-pitched ringing]

101
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,145
[Agent Sharpe] All right.

102
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,649
Gideon, status.

103
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,235
Gideon?

104
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,237
[Gideon] Still assessing the damage,
Ms. Sharpe.

105
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,114
Running on backup power.

106
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,865
[grunts]

107
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,578
I'm sorry, Z.

108
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,872
- What happened?
- It didn't work.

109
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,208
- Okay, so we try again.
- I said it didn't work.

110
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,753
I've never tried to use the Loom
without my sisters.

111
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,130
I guess I need them.

112
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,214
Then let me try it.

113
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,051
Lachesis said she was preparing me
to be a Fate. Maybe I can--

114
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,262
Yeah, go ahead if you wanna
burn up from the inside.

115
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,389
Okay, what are we supposed to do?

116
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,808
Right now, we're just gonna sit tight
and try to fix the ship.

117
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,059
[electricity crackling]

118
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,436
Well, that's great.

119
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,980
I could do some research
back at the house,

120
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,274
see if there isn't another way
to harness the rings.

121
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,067
I could use another set of eyes.

122
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,029
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere
until Behrad's back.

123
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,782
Wait. So, I left an empire in Hell
for "sit tight,"

124
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,200
for "do some research"?

125
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,703
Not good enough.

126
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,622
[Gideon] Apologies,
but no one's going anywhere.

127
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,458
The energy burst
created an anti-chronotomic field.

128
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,418
Time travel functions are offline.

129
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,754
So, no Jumpships, no Time Couriers?

130
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,672
-[Gideon] All out of commission.
- Great.

131
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,049
We're stuck.

132
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,302
Why are the lights out?

133
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,512
The ship better not be broken.

134
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,181
[Gideon] Unfortunately, I am.

135
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,975
I was damaged in an explosion
caused by the Loom of Fate.

136
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,727
You're kidding me.

137
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,896
I promised the kid we'd time travel.

138
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,606
Now she's gonna fail her exam.

139
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,066
Nope, it's fine. I'll be okay.

140
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,360
We have to find you a room to study in.

141
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:09,614
Um, did the computer
just say "Loom of Fate"?

142
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,830
[exhales deeply]
Things are really bad, baby.

143
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,541
Ship's broken.

144
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,129
The Loom backfired and almost
killed Charlie. Everybody's bickering.

145
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,092
The chances of getting Behrad back
have never felt more slim.

146
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,346
We could really use your vision.

147
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,516
I could really use you.

148
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,479
[breathes deeply]

149
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,609
- Oh, my God, Sara, you're awake.
-[groans]

150
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,490
Ava?

151
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,827
I can't see anything.

152
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,286
Gideon, what's wrong with her eyes?

153
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,081
[Gideon] Unfortunately, Ms. Sharpe,
at my current power levels,

154
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,459
I am unable to offer a prognosis.
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,712
You're sorry? What are you
talking about? She's blind.

156
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,547
Reroute some power, Gideon.
Do something.

157
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,881
Ava, shh. It's okay, all right?

158
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,466
It's probably just temporary.

159
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,676
What if it's not? Lay back.

160
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,554
Who knows what else
is wrong with you.

161
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,103
[Sara gasps]

162
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,148
[gasping]

163
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,024
Sara?

164
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,539
[exhales]

165
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,916
You were startled when we touched.
What happened?

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,126
Nothing.

167
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,795
Are you hiding something from me?

168
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,046
Always.

169
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,131
Come on, Sara.

170
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,801
Babe, it was just a weird reaction
to waking up from a coma.

171
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,013
Whoa, no, no, no, no, no. Where do you
think you're going? You can't see.

172
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,766
I trained in a blindfold for weeks
in the League of Assassins.

173
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,268
And nobody knows
how to fix the ship like I do.

174
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,811
Except for maybe Ray and Jax.

175
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,731
And Rip and Stein.

176
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,107
I guess Behrad's not bad either.

177
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,109
But you know what? None of them
are walking through that door,

178
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,486
so let's go.

179
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,199
So, what did I miss?

180
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,743
Oh, nothing much, actually. Just, uh...

181
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,369
Hey, Mick.

182
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,871
Hi.

183
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,666
Oh, uh, Lita, this is Sara Lance,
the captain.

184
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,919
Sara, this is Lita, my kid.

185
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,962
Oh! Uh...

186
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,255
Nice to meet you.

187
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,512
<i>[Lita] It's really cool
that there's a woman in charge here.</i>

188
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,348
[gasps]

189
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,474
[Sara] Uh, what, sorry?

190
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,352
I just said that it's really cool
that there's a woman in charge here.

191
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,939
- Uh-huh. Uh, yes.
- Good... Good to see you.

192
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,315
- Yes, it is.
- Come on.

193
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,319
What are you not telling me?

194
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,571
What are you not telling me?
There's a kid on the ship?

195
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,489
<i>I--</i>

196
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,532
[Gary Junior barks]

197
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,700
And a dog? Ava?

198
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,701
[hesitates]

199
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,495
Gary has an emotional support animal.

200
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,205
He had a signed letter.

201
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,541
- That's not a thing.
- I don't know, baby. Come here.

202
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,511
Is that Behrad?

203
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,430
He sounds like a pretty nice guy.
Were you two close?

204
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,978
No. But we were starting to be.

205
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,650
I only just learned about
this big life he was living

206
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,402
and then I lost him.

207
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,655
But I'm getting him back, so...

208
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,532
Yeah, about that.

209
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,618
I think I might have a way to do it.

210
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,413
I'm listening.

211
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,958
You know, I think I'm probably good
for my test tomorrow.

212
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,877
I'd kind of just like to
look around the ship.

213
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,087
Uh, you got to hit the books.

214
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:54,964
Punched him.

215
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,465
Elbowed him.

216
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,383
Ooh.

217
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,969
Made out with her.

218
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,929
Okay, smart guy.

219
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,764
We're studying the French Revolution.

220
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,474
I've heard of it.

221
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,104
So, I have to compare and contrast
the American Declaration of Independence

222
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:13,524
and the French Declaration
of Rights of Man and Citizen.

223
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,526
Right.

224
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,196
So, does anybody on the ship
know history?

225
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,783
I know a guy.

226
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:27,121
Did I hear someone say the Declaration
of the Rights of Man and Citizen?

227
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,789
Hi. Dr. Nathaniel Heywood.

228
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,500
I specialize in deductive
historical reconstruction.

229
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,836
Now, while technically I am a doctor,

230
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,421
you can call me Professor.

231
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,424
Or Steel because...

232
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:39,884
[slang]

233
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,135
I turn into it.

234
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:43,930
Whoa.

235
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,766
You're the coolest professor
I've ever met.

236
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,225
Most likely, yeah.

237
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,352
[Mick] All right.

238
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,436
Let's study.

239
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,356
Well, we can't study
without snacks, right?

240
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,399
[whispers] Gideon makes the best snacks.

241
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,943
Really? Can we have Ants on a Log?

242
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,069
Okay, Ants on...

243
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,447
Mick, can you be an absolute peach
and run to the Fabricator for us?

244
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,044
Now, what's happening with your sight
is a mystery, love.

245
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,546
Are you experiencing any more effects?

246
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,055
[exhales] No, nothing.

247
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,349
Oh, well, we'll just have to
wait and see then.

248
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,435
And there is one other matter
to discuss.

249
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,354
Astra Logue is on the ship.

250
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,147
What?

251
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,274
Ava?

252
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:41,278
Uh, sorry, babe, but there was just
never a good time to tell you.

253
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,780
She was only supposed to
be here temporarily

254
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:43,864
and then the Loom didn't work.

255
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,950
She cannot be on the ship.

256
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,578
I mean, what if...
What if she goes on a stabbing spree?

257
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,248
A stabbing spree? Well, that seems
a little excessive, honey.

258
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,917
Look, she's made her choice.
She decided to throw in with us.

259
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,421
- Now, why would you doubt her word?
- Look, I don't know, okay? It's just...

260
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,547
It's a feeling.

261
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,259
John, I need you by her side 24/7.

262
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,261
Fine.

263
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,307
What if Charlie just wasn't warmed up?

264
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,979
She tried to reweave the most
complicated thread right out the gate.

265
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,357
What if she tries with an easier thread?

266
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:23,487
One that hasn't been complicated
by, well, time travel.

267
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,990
Like your mother's?

268
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,533
Exactly.

269
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,537
If she succeeds
on an easy thread like hers,

270
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,581
she might be ready
to try Behrad's again.

271
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,584
The thing is,

272
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,794
if it comes from me,
they might not buy it.

273
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,505
But if it comes from me...

274
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,342
they just might.

275
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,599
[Gideon] Again, I do apologize

276
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,143
that the Fabricator
is not functioning, Mr. Rory.

277
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,066
Oh, man. Must have been damaged
in the explosion.

278
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,862
Oh! Ants on a Log?

279
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,113
[Gary Junior yaps]

280
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,325
Are those for sharesies?

281
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,368
My kid.

282
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,286
Oh.

283
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,455
I see what's happening here.

284
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,290
You're new
to this whole parenting thing.

285
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,875
You know what?

286
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,837
I think you need some advice
from the Papa Gare.

287
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,549
Parenting is about doing the crap work.

288
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,967
No matter how degrading,

289
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,178
and never, ever once
hearing a word of thanks.

290
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,014
But you'll know in your heart
that they appreciate it.

291
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,475
Even if the thought
never crosses their mind.

292
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,811
Isn't that right, Gary Junior?

293
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,728
Oh.

294
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,773
Duty calls, as they say.

295
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,775
Crap work.

296
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,114
[exhales]

297
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,452
[thud]

298
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,579
What is that?

299
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,210
Okay.

300
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,089
I've removed panel 16-QW45G.

301
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,215
[Sara] Mmm.

302
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,343
No, I'm pretty sure I said 16-QW45T.

303
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,511
No, you said "G."

304
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,264
- No, 16--
- Okay. Yep. Finding T.

305
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,974
[Charlie] Sara?

306
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,101
Caught a case of blindness, I hear.

307
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,688
Yeah, and while Gideon's down,

308
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,648
I'm stuck like this,
but it's no big deal.

309
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,316
No big deal?

310
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,861
Right, you're the first mortal
to ever see a god's true form

311
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,321
and live to tell the tale,
and that is no big deal.

312
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,115
It's no big deal.

313
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,618
So nothing else
has been happening, right?

314
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,204
-[sighs]
- There's no other side effects?

315
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,875
Look, I know you're not
being honest with me, Sara.

316
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,209
I just wanna help.

317
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,086
What is she talking about, babe?

318
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,215
[sighs] Look, it's nothing, okay?
I just...

319
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,093
I didn't wanna upset anyone.

320
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,304
What's so upsetting?

321
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:59,602
When I touch somebody,
I see people stabbed to death.

322
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,855
But it's probably
just some subconscious fear

323
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,357
that's being kicked up by the coma.
It's like a... It's a nightmare.

324
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,860
You've lost one kind of vision,
and you've gained another.

325
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,111
Sara, you're seeing the future.

326
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,739
Look, they're just nightmares, Charlie.

327
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,994
This can't be the future, all right?

328
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,038
- It's not possible.
- Why?

329
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,832
You're a Paragon of Destiny
who got radiated by godly light.

330
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,168
Why is it so impossible that you've
gained the gift of foresight?

331
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,878
Because we don't all die.

332
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,006
"We"? What do you mean, like,

333
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,550
we die in, like, 50 years,

334
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:35,095
or we die with me
wearing this exact outfit?

335
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,683
Option two.

336
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,894
- It's got to be Astra.
-[Agent Sharpe] Charlie.

337
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,771
Would you stop with the Astra thing?

338
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,648
She saved our lives in Hell, okay?

339
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,191
I'm not gonna just assume the worst.

340
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,109
What, that she's
some manipulative psychopath?

341
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,987
Well, she just tried to manipulate me
into coming in here

342
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,156
and begging Charlie
to use the Loom again, so...

343
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,532
Okay, well, that's not a crime.

344
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,992
Guys, the rings.

345
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,744
They're gone.

346
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,080
I found this in the trash chute.

347
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,873
Okay, that is a crime.

348
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:06,293
Gidget, play back internal monitoring
of the parlor, please.

349
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,546
[Gideon] My internal monitoring
subsystems have been disabled.

350
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,465
I'm afraid we have a saboteur on board.

351
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,718
Okay. Now I'm starting
to assume the worst.

352
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,143
Well, this was inevitable, wasn't it?

353
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,441
First thing that goes wrong,
and you all point the finger at me.

354
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,026
You know what, Astra? Slow your roll.

355
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,778
You wanted the rings
and now they're missing, so...

356
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,531
You're the only person
who doesn't belong on this ship.

357
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,865
Happily.

358
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,368
Look, I was with her the whole time,
all right? She never took the rings.

359
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,496
And besides, how is she supposed
to have sabotaged Gideon, eh?

360
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,664
We have no idea, John.

361
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,874
That's why she's here
and not out the airlock, okay?

362
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,294
- Come on, babe.
- Sorry, Astra.

363
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,838
You just spent too much time
with my sisters to be trusted.

364
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,051
I was shown more hospitality
in the deepest pits of Hell

365
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,261
than on this ship of fools.

366
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,221
Yeah, just sit tight, all right?

367
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,682
I got just the spell
to track this saboteur.

368
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,183
I never should have trusted you.

369
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,184
[Constantine scoffs]

370
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,895
Did you really, though?

371
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,816
Or did you just run out of
other options?

372
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,612
[sighs]

373
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,907
Then there's Zari.
She's from the future.

374
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,410
She's supes cute,
and she can control air.

375
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,870
- What?
- Yep. [smacks lips]

376
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,538
[Mick] Ants on a Log.

377
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,624
Everybody here has a superpower.

378
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,001
Do you have a superpower?

379
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,754
I have this.

380
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,255
Your gun?

381
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,007
Uh, yes.

382
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,551
Your superpower is that you shoot a gun?

383
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,553
It shoots fire.

384
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,804
No, I know. I don't like any guns.

385
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:41,722
Why not?

386
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:45,434
I marched in protest of them.
Do you know how dangerous that thing is?

387
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,643
Well, that's the point.

388
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,854
[clears throat] Lita...

389
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,398
You know,
if it wasn't for your pops here,

390
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,317
we wouldn't be able
to travel through time.

391
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,860
Mick keeps the lights on.

392
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,278
Lights are off.

393
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,865
Oh, it's an unfortunate coincidence.

394
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:05,287
However, Mick funds this whole operation
through the simple act of stealing.

395
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,332
Oh, didn't you go to prison
for stealing?

396
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,042
Isn't that why you missed my childhood?

397
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,795
[softly] Damn it, Mick.

398
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,838
[clears throat]
Sometimes they're just souvenirs.

399
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:20,344
Like, Mick, did you happen to steal
any French Revolution souvenirs

400
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,512
from Marie Antoinette?

401
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,640
[softly] say Yes-

402
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,393
Yes. Yes. Yes, I did.

403
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,645
Really? Can I see them?

404
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,979
Really?

405
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,441
Come with me.

406
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,156
Not bad, Nate. Not bad at all.

407
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,242
Mmm.

408
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,412
Not bad, Mick. Not bad at all.

409
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,164
[crackling]

410
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,293
Well?

411
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,045
Yeah, definitely sabotage.

412
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,171
Yeah, thought so.

413
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,091
Ooh. What happened here?

414
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,135
Hmm, we have a saboteur.

415
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,512
Hmm. I think I know who it is.

416
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,973
-[crackling]
- Oh, come on!

417
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,520
Oh, hello, Zari.

418
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,980
Hello, Astra.

419
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,984
Look, I'm sorry you are locked up.

420
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,611
Well, at least we have that in common.

421
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:25,159
We also both lost a relative
who we want back,

422
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,662
and got screwed when the Loom failed.

423
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,415
[scoffs] One of us
more than the other.

424
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,043
[Zari chuckles]

425
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:39,673
Okay, I know John is out there
trying to prove your innocence,

426
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,759
but we both know
how much you wanted those rings,

427
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,053
so why not just give them back?

428
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,849
[chuckles] Oh, wait. I see now.

429
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,310
You think you're here to interrogate me,

430
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,021
but that's not why you're really here.

431
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,064
No, that's literally why I'm here.

432
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,818
You're here because you've got Nate
wrapped around your finger,

433
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:03,739
and you thought you had John
wrapped around your finger, too...

434
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,533
but you don't.

435
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,745
[scoffs] What are you talking about?

436
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,290
When we were choosing
who to weave first,

437
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,000
he picked my mother.

438
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,295
- Not Behrad.
-[chuckles]

439
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,340
You think you clocked something
between John and I,

440
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,134
and now you're using it
to manipulate me.

441
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,302
Wow.

442
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,386
You are devious.

443
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,222
So are you.

444
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,975
So why don't you use
that devious little brain of yours

445
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,270
and figure out
who really took the rings?

446
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,067
[Sara] You think you can repair
the security cameras to find our thief?

447
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,401
[Agent Sharpe sighs] Maybe, but...

448
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,280
whoever did this left a lot of damage
and not a lot of clues.

449
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,118
Ah, it seems we've all arrived
at the scene of the crime.

450
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,120
Well, this crime, anyway.

451
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,789
You know, we could, um...

452
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,583
We could just work together
to find our ring thief.

453
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,584
[chuckles]

454
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,879
And how can I hope to defend Astra
by teaming up with her accusers?

455
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,839
We're all looking for the truth, John.

456
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,925
Yeah, well, some of us
can just see the situation

457
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,218
a little more clearly than others.

458
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,813
[gasps]

459
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,608
You Okay?

460
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,236
- What's wrong?
- I...

461
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,362
It was me.

462
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,073
I kill everyone.

463
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,414
[Agent Sharpe] Baby,
you are an amazing assassin, okay?

464
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,207
But you're blind
and now you've warned us.

465
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,917
The idea of you killing everyone is--

466
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,961
Arrogant? Delusional? Just plain rude.

467
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,629
Yeah, and you're not
that kind of person.

468
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,881
Something is going on with me,
all right?

469
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,467
I went from seeing you all dead
to being the one responsible for it,

470
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,885
and I don't know why.

471
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,847
Look, you have to figure out
what is going on.

472
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,141
And until then,
I cannot be trusted, all right?

473
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,977
So promise me, no matter what I say,

474
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,353
you will not let me out of here.

475
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,272
Okay, I promise, honey.
I love you, all right?

476
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,482
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
Just please take a breath.

477
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,407
And what exactly
are we getting to the bottom of?

478
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,909
I have no idea.
She has lost her damn mind.

479
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,709
- Don't touch anything.
- Copy that.

480
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,757
Whoa.

481
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,097
You really like to steal.

482
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,266
Don't tell your mom. Here.

483
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,227
This belonged to the headless lady.

484
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:47,444
So, I really dig the whole
Scrooge McDuck aesthetic,

485
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,488
but why not put your money in a bank?

486
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,822
Bank?

487
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,324
Too easy to rob.

488
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,118
Hold on, all of your money is here?

489
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,454
What if somebody robs this?

490
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,872
Let them try.

491
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,207
What about compound interest?

492
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,918
Okay, how much money is in here?

493
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,921
Uh, million? Billion.

494
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,382
And in ten years,
how much is that gonna be worth?

495
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,968
The same. It's gonna be worth the same.

496
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,013
If you invest it,
it'll be worth way more.

497
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,973
Sounds complicated.

498
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,811
What if you take the time machine

499
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:24,314
back to the start of the New York
Stock Exchange and invest it all then?

500
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,402
We could go and buy Manhattan
in the 1600s.

501
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,070
We can invent Bitcoin.

502
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:33,907
We can become partners
in getting freaking rich.

503
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,618
What the hell?

504
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,496
Room's off-limits.

505
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,790
So we're finally connecting,
and you're shutting me out?

506
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,209
You're a terrible father.

507
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,673
What are you doing?

508
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,717
Looking for footage of you
stealing the rings.

509
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,135
It doesn't exist.

510
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,929
Besides, I thought
the cameras were sabotaged.

511
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,806
I'm hacking the backup feed.

512
00:25:58,724 --> 00:25:59,766
You hack?

513
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,601
Mmm, not so much me,

514
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,687
but a version of me that used to exist.

515
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,607
Do you think I could talk
to this other version of you?

516
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,650
Maybe she'd trust me.

517
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,069
Shush. She wouldn't.

518
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:16,074
You know, you could gain trust
the normal way by being trustworthy.

519
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:20,078
Well, things are getting crazy
out there. Sara just locked herself up.

520
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,539
Is locking someone up
her solution to everything?

521
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,708
She had a vision that she killed us all.

522
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,625
Oh.

523
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,711
Great. So I'm exonerated? I can go?

524
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:31,757
Mmm, no, you're staying in time-out
until we find out where these rings are.

525
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,967
-[computer chimes]
- Huh. Speaking of which,

526
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,094
backup feed is up.

527
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,226
Oh, my God!

528
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,895
Charlie, Why'd you take the rings?

529
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,313
Mate, that wasn't me.

530
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,690
I mean, it was. But it wasn't.

531
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:51,193
Ooh. That does not look good for me.

532
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,155
[imperceptible]

533
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,492
You disabled the cameras?

534
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,534
Are you two in cahoots?

535
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,244
- No.
- No, obviously not.

536
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,039
Why would I hack into footage
that incriminates myself?

537
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,540
I don't know.

538
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,962
I just destroyed the Food Fabricator.

539
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,672
Which makes no sense 'cause I love food.

540
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,800
And let me guess,
you don't remember that either, eh?

541
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,801
No.

542
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,472
-[gasps]
- Oh!

543
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,099
I am guessing
you also don't remember that.

544
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,227
I can't believe that
I flushed the Loom of Fate.

545
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,145
[Nate] Well, it's all right there
in the surveillance footage

546
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,606
Gideon apparently records
of our bathroom.

547
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:30,982
Ew.

548
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,485
Well, clearly you're all the culprits,

549
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,863
which, obviously, exonerates me.

550
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,281
No. Still no.

551
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,325
Yeah, this could all be mind control.

552
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,536
You think I'm behind it?

553
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:44,663
[all] Yeah.

554
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,873

[growling]

558
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,594
It's Papa Gare to the rescue.

559
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,972
Damn it, Gary,
what are you doing in here?

560
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,224
Oh, don't worry, I'm not gonna
let you out. I'm not a crazy person.

561
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,685
No, I'm serious.
You cannot be in here, it is not safe.

562
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,729
Well, neither is solitary confinement.

- Gary, what are...

- What?
- Which is why,

565
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,028
after careful consideration,
I decided...

[chuckles]

567
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,199
...you need my emotional support dog
more than I do.

568
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,619
I mean... I guess...

569
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,289
I guess it is kind of comforting.

570
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,584
Just promise me you'll treat him
like the little angel he is.

Who... Who said that?

- Said what? Gary Junior, stop barking.

[Sara gasps]

Your dog... Your dog is a demon,

587
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,710
and it's gonna tell me to kill everyone.

588
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,670
But you know what?
I am not gonna listen.

589
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,005
I'm not gonna listen, dog.

590
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,883
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't raise your voice.

591
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:23,637
Gary Junior's a very nervous pee-er.

Hey!

- Hey, where is everyone?
- Sara, Sara, Sara, hey, hey.

Oh, bollocks. How did you escape?

595
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,027
Hey, look, I figured it out.

596
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,489
It's Gary's dog.
He's gonna make me kill everyone.

00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,949
Okay, babe, just calm down.

598
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,784
You told us not to listen
to anything you say. The dog?

Look, I know, but just listen.

600
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,912
I can prove to you
that I am telling the truth, all right?

601
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,748
I had a vision that I killed Gary,

602
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,583
and then, in real-time, I saved him.

603
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:57,629
And the fact that he is alive right now
proves that I am not lying.

You were right
to lock yourself up, love.

Well, when you say it like that...

639
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,888

He was all alone, I felt bad for him.

Oh, my God.

641
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,808
Sara was right.
This dog is making us go crazy.

642
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,185
This is absurd.

643
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,812
This is more absurd than
that StabCast I did on the Son of Sam.

644
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,148
Uh, wait, uh...

645
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,526
What does "Son of Sam" mean? 'Cause I...

646
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:47,489
I feel like Gary Junior
kept saying that to me in his barks.

647
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,241
What? No. It was a guy in the '70s
in New York. He killed a bunch of people

648
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,452
and later said
that a dog made him do it. Oh, my God!

649
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,456
You adopted Son of Sam's demon dog.

650
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,333
- Oh, my God.
-[shudders]

651
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,377
At least I didn't buy from a breeder.

652
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,675
[barks]

653
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,011
Whatever he says, don't listen to him.

654
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,097
All I hear is annoying barking.

655
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,099
All I hear is
why I should murder you all.

656
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,851
And he's making some very good points.

657
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,438
- Nate.
- Nate.

658
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,190
- Nate... No.
-[barking continues]

659
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,191
Whoa.

660
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,651
Hey, hey, hey!

661
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,194
[imperceptible]

662
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,445
[barking stops]

663
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,323
Was I trying to murder you
with the stool?

664
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,699
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

665
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,452
[gasps] I am so sorry, guys.

666
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,246
What the hell are you doing?

667
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,289
It's a whistle only dogs can hear.

668
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,625
Why are you doing this to us?

669
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,377
<i>[Gary Junior] Because I hate hats.</i>

670
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,045
<i>I hate stupid ties.</i>

671
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,547
<i>And I hate Gary.</i>

672
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,967
But I rescued you from Hell.

673
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,093
From Hell?

674
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,012
Wait, are you working for my sisters?

675
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:57,559
<i>Uh, no, sweetheart.
I'm the Canine of Chaos.</i>

676
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,310
<i>I was gonna have you murder each other,</i>

677
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,815
<i>but now I'm gonna kill you myself.</i>

678
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:09,863
[growls]

679
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,239
Whoa.

680
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,490
[Agent Sharpe] Get to the dais.

681
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:13,867
-[Astra] Don't let me out now!
-[roars]

682
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,201
[all gasp]

683
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,375
Where'd he go?

684
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,751
[roar]

685
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,086
What's that?

686
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,216
[growling]

687
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,349
Yeah, it looks like
we owe you an apology, love.

688
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,893
Wait, that was Junior?

689
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,687
Let's just say
Gary has some explaining to do.

690
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,816
Come on, let's go stop this bloody thing
before it kills someone.

691
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,405
Gary, your hand's on my... Just move it.

692
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,323
Sorry.

693
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,116
- Ow, Gary, that hurts.
- Sorry.

694
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,119
Gary, your hand is still on my...

695
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,662
No, I think that's me.

696
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,623
You can leave it if you're comfortable.

697
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,166
- It's... It really doesn't bother me.
- Can I put my hand back?

698
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,876
- Man, shut up, Gary!
- No.

699
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:08,421
Why are you all acting like I brought
the Son of Sam's dog here on purpose?

700
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,797
- That's who that demon is?
- Yeah.

701
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,926
- Let me out. I will get rid of him.
- How?

702
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,595
- You still don't trust me, do you?
- No.

703
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,138
Ava, just let her out.

704
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,264
If we'd listened to her
in the first place,

705
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:20,725
we wouldn't be in this
hot, uncomfortable mess.

706
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,393
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

707
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,270
Astra, I...

708
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:30,568
Uh, yeah. Hey, I think you accidentally
put the force field back up.

709
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,238
I think she knows.

710
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:36,449
[Agent Sharpe] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

711
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:39,160
[Nate] Oh, come on!
You gotta be kidding!

712
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:43,248
You really shouldn't mess with someone
so comfortable with torture.

713
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,172
Lita. Open the door.

714
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,674
[Lita] Go away, Becky.

715
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,885
I know what it's like
to be mad at your parents.

716
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,387
I lit mine on fire.

717
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,932
But... Let's talk about it.

718
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,643
We have nothing to talk about.

719
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,688

[Gary Junior snarls]

721
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,236
This is taking too damn long.

722
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,113
- We have to find that dog.
- Yeah, don't I know it?

723
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,865
And I could really use
another set of eyes. No offense.

724
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,995
Wait, wait, wait. What if we can use
my vision to search the ship?

725
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,830
- Yeah?
- Give me your hand.

726
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,834

[breathing heavily]

728
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,881
Is it working?

729
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,925
- We have to get to the library.
- Come on.

- What did you do?
-[panting]

00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,858
I told it to attack me.

747
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,401
But at least I've got you to protect me.

748
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,028
John, I'm blind.

749

Now what?

753
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,378
[sighs] To send the demon to Hell,
I need to know its true name.

754
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,838
Well, I'm pretty sure
it's not Gary Junior.

755
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,757
His name is Marchosias.

00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,132
Gideon, did something die
in your ventilation system?

768
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,883
No. It's me.

769
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:45,304
[sighs] I had to scour every inch
of the waste disposal unit,

770
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,764
but I found the rings.

771
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:47,682
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

772
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,683
Just... Just hold on.

[Sara] Ugh.

774
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,270
Thanks, Gary.

775
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,355
Yeah, getting the rings was tough,

776
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:57,900
but fair punishment
for letting a Hell Hound onto the ship.

777
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,487
It's all right. All is forgiven.
You were obviously mind-controlled.

778
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,657
- I wasn't.
- Huh?

779
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,659
I just thought he was really cute.

780
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,786
- Of course you did.
- Yeah.

781
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,124
Well, this has been
very traumatic for me,

782
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:16,586
so, um, once the Time Couriers
came back online,

783
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,046
I, uh, got myself another
emotional support animal.

784
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,465
- You what? What?
- Oh, come on.

785
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:23,885
-[Sara] What is it?
- It's a wittle wabbit.

786
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,762
- Oh! Babe, it's actually really cute.
- What?

787
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,765
I've named him Gary Junior ll.
[chuckles]

788
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,976
Please tell me he's not from Hell,
though, because I'm gonna have to--

789
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,769
No, no, I wouldn't
make that mistake again.

790
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,022
- Okay.
- No, I got this wittle guy

791
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,940
from a mysterious carnie

792
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,610
who warned me
never to feed him past midnight.

[laughs]

794
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,327
Is one of those for me?

795
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,162
No. You're too young.

796
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,372
Oh, so, now you obey the law?

797
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,666
Never.

00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,469
and I only want what's best for you.

801
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,139
I was a little harsh before.

802
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,308
It's okay. You saved my life.

803
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,436
It's... It's no excuse. Let me explain.

804
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,357
Ah.

805
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,152
"The life of a criminal
is a life of misery.

806
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:27,198
I've spent years in jail
thanks to some red leather freak

807
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:30,076
-so fast that I couldn't--"
- It's okay, it's okay. I get it.

808
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,495
You just don't want me
to suffer in the ways that you have.

809
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,541
Should I, um, stop reading?

810
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,794
We have a common interest,

811
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,754
and I thought we could bond over it.

812
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,548
But I understand why we shouldn't.

813
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,636
Right. I'll, uh, take you home.

814
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,972
Why? I thought we were
spending the weekend together.

815
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:52,890
You wanna stay?

816
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,310
Yeah. Today wasn't so bad...

817
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:58,854
Dad.

818
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,440
[Mick] Hmm.

819
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,695
- Roller derby tomorrow?
- No, absolutely not.

820
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,363
- The mall?
- Definitely no.

821
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,915
[sighs] I see you're
making yourself comfortable.

822
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,168
You looking for John?

823
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,006
No. I am looking for you.

824
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,383
<i>Why?</i>

825
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,343
We're not friends.

826
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,722
I only saved your entire team
because it helped me.

827
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:36,434
And I only told Ava to let you out
because it helped us.

828
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,645
So we're even. We're the same.

829
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:44,108
No, girl, you released
Encores onto the world

830
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,860
just to get your own way.

831
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:47,820
So we're not even.

832
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,197
We'll keep using each other
till it stops suiting us.

833
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,116
I am comfortable with that.

834
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,745
Well, I'm not.

835
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,082
I don't know, let's see
if we can be more than that.

836
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,545
Come on, let me show you around
this weirdo ship.

837
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,047
I'm good.

838
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,341
Not planning on staying long.

839
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,261
But you get points for trying.

840
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:13,929
[chuckles]

841
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,223
Okay.

842
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,776
So, I was thinking maybe later
we could try--

843
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,235
Try blindfolding you?

844
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,737
Stop reading my mind
or it's gonna get--

845
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,906
- Awesome?
- Oh. [chuckles]

846
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,616
Okay, let's just fix you up.

847
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,368
Come on, baby.

848
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,786

00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,204
[sighs]

850
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,375
- Okay, Gideon, do your thing.
-[sighs]

851
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,588
[Gideon] Scan complete.

852
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:51,217
I do not detect any abnormalities
in Captain Lance's ocular region.

853
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,302
What do you mean, no abnormalities?

854
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,805
- Gideon, she's still blind.
-[Gideon] I'm sorry,

855
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,516
but there's nothing I can do.
