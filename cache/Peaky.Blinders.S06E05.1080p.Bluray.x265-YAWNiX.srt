1
00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:02,679
{\an8}<i>A daughter lost.</i>

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:04,799
{\an8}A son found. He is yours.

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:06,639
{\an8}Evadne Barwell?

4
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,959
<i>Since you have proven
your commitment,</i>

5
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:12,359
<i>Boston is now officially open</i>

6
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,079
for the importation
of your merchandise.

7
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,159
Jack says just a few more weeks
and you'll be free.

8
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:20,239
Stories about you
come up the canal.

9
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:21,999
<i>Once you walked fine alone,</i>

10
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:24,359
<i>now you need a stick.</i>

11
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:25,479
<i>You stay clean for two weeks,</i>

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,519
I'll write Linda
another letter.

13
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:29,239
<i>Have you recently
suffered seizures?</i>

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,959
It is tuberculoma.
I am afraid it is inoperable.

15
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:56,839
Mr Shelby.

16
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,959
I only gave opium
to your brother

17
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,999
because he give me big trouble.

18
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,759
He attacked my wife.

19
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,599
I'd like a pot of green tea,
please.

20
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,439
It's taken me ten years
to build this business.

21
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:30,119
Business will be safe,
if you do what I say.

22
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,839
How much opium do you have
in your cellar?

23
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,639
Five pounds.

24
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,079
Bring it to me.

25
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,719
Four minutes,
against the clock.

26
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:18,759
As a Member of Parliament...

27
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,199
...for this constituency. <i>..</i>

28
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,359
<i>...it</i> is my duty

29
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,159
to take responsibility
for the welfare. <i>..</i>

30
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:28,199
- Mr Shelby!
- <i>..</i> .of my constituents.

31
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,839
The clock is still ticking.

32
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,919
The consumption of opium
is very prejudicial to health.

33
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,279
Women give it to their children
so they can leave them untended

34
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:37,839
while they work
in the factories.

35
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,839
Men lose their jobs
when they become addicted.

36
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:48,959
From now on, you will sell
only cigarettes, cake and tea.

37
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:53,559
If I hear that you're selling
opium again, time will indeed

38
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:55,519
run out very quickly for you.
Do you understand?

39
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,999
Yes, I understand, I will stop.

40
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:00,199
Mr Shelby,
the clock is still ticking.

41
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,399
Please tell...

42
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,759
...your suppliers
and your customers. <i>..</i>

43
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:15,519
<i>...that</i> from now on. <i>..</i>

44
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,799
<i>..</i> .There will be no more opium

45
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:22,159
in Small Heath or in Bordesley.

46
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,039
Thank you for the tea.

47
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:06,279
- You can let them through now.
- Yes, sir, Mr Shelby.

48
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,039
You tell the pub
and cafe owners

49
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:11,399
in Montague Street. <i>..</i>

50
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,159
<i>..</i> .If there's any further trade
in powder,

51
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,999
there will be no more
Montague Street.

52
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:18,199
I'll have it demolished
and replaced by apartments,

53
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,039
by order of the Birmingham
Urban District Council.

54
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,919
Sorry I'm late,
they closed Montague Street.

55
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,239
There's a gas explosion or...

56
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,759
Right, well, it would be nice
if just one thing

57
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,719
could happen in Birmingham
that wasn'<i>t</i> our fault.

58
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:57,759
I've gathered you all here
today because there is news,

59
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:00,519
and it's of interest
to the whole family.

60
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,839
First of all,

61
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,199
I'd like to welcome
Finn's new wife, Mary,

62
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,959
to the family.

63
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,839
Right, well, I'm very glad

64
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,679
that I dragged myself
out of bed for this.

65
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,639
There is...

66
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,679
...one more item of business.

67
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:21,199
- Johnny.
- Tom.

68
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:24,279
Come on, come on.

69
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,599
Hurry up.

70
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,039
Everyone...

71
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,039
...this here is Erasmus.

72
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,319
Nobody calls me <i>that.</i>

73
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,239
They call him Duke.

74
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:47,879
20 years ago,
at Appleby Horse Fair. <i>..</i>

75
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,879
...I met a girl.

76
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:51,919
We shared the shade
of a hazel tree.

77
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,559
Nine months later,
this lad was born.

78
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:00,959
This is my son.

79
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,999
His mother died on the road.

80
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:06,879
Up until now,
never tried to find him.

81
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:10,559
But I'm trying to look at life
in a different <i>way.</i>

82
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,119
A child is a precious thing.

83
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,079
So I'm bringing him...

84
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,479
Into the fucking family
with a snap of his fingers.

85
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:23,839
No, I am bringing him
into the fold.

86
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,039
He'll have to earn membership
of the family.

87
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:30,359
For the moment, welcome, son.
You have a seat. Go on.

88
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,759
Sit down here.

89
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,719
There are some mistakes
I've made...

90
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,839
<i>...that</i> I can never address. <i>..</i>

91
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,199
...and some I can.

92
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,279
Some wounds I can <i>try to</i> heal.

93
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:50,039
And new wounds you can open up.

94
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,719
Anyway...

95
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,399
<i>...that</i>'s the business
of the day.

96
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:57,599
Is it too early for whiskey?

97
00:07:57,623 --> 00:08:05,623
http://hiqve.com/

98
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,679
There you go.

99
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,599
Shelby breakfast for you, son.

100
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:10,319
I don't drink.

101
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:14,119
And I'm not a Shelby,
all right? I'm a Duke.

102
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:18,079
You're a fucking
Shelby, all right.

103
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,559
Don'<i>t</i> worry about <i>that.</i>

104
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:23,439
Mm, I think we'll need Curly

105
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:25,999
and a strong rope
to break this one in, Tom.

106
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:27,839
Arthur, open up the shop,

107
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,399
put the kid here
on the blackboard,

108
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,639
writing up the odds.

109
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,439
I can'<i>t write.</i>

110
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,239
Put the kid on the blackboard,
wiping off the chalk.

111
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,999
Go on, son.

112
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,799
Come on, then.

113
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,439
Lizzie...

114
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,759
...come on.

115
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,159
My father was
the Duke of the Saxon Shore.

116
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,999
My mother was a Romany queen.

117
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,759
Who told you that, your mum?

118
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,479
I don'<i>t</i> allow people to talk
about my mother.

119
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,359
Good for you.

120
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,039
So let's get this right, then.

121
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,399
You can't read,
you can'<i>t</i> fucking write.

122
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,479
Nothing wrong with <i>that.</i>

123
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:30,919
What can you do, eh?

124
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,799
I can tell the time.

125
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,079
Tell the time.

126
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,199
Here, he can tell the time.

127
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:37,959
Ain't that clever?!

128
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:41,359
It's a lot more
than what you can fucking do.

129
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,999
What did you just say to me?

130
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:49,159
What time is it, Mr Shelby?

131
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:54,759
That's what I can do.

132
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,519
You little bastard.

133
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:01,159
Here, keep it.

134
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,639
Stop you from being late
in the future.

135
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:33,479
Is there forgiveness
in your heart

136
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,959
for Arthur Shelby?

137
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,639
No.

138
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,119
But there may be forgiveness
from God.

139
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,639
And you will do God's work?

140
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,079
God is interested in you
as well, Tommy.

141
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:53,039
And God will be with you
on your journey,

142
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,239
every step of the <i>way.</i>

143
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:01,239
He may not need to take
many steps.

144
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,279
So, tell me this, Linda. <i>..</i>

145
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:20,279
<i>..</i> .Is God interested in me. <i>..</i>

146
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:23,279
<i>..</i> .Or in my money?

147
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,439
I believe you run a foundation,

148
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,799
and that your foundation has
many missions across the world,

149
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:35,359
but in these times
of financial crisis,

150
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:38,359
funding is hard to come by,
so perhaps...

151
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,039
...your God's plan
is a practical one.

152
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,359
Perhaps, He would like me
to make a donation

153
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:46,039
to your foundation

154
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,439
and, in return,
He would like you

155
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:52,239
to help my brother on his road
to redemption.

156
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:56,119
Now, I know that in a place
of worship such as this,

157
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,839
you would never ask how much.

158
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,719
So I will tell you plainly.

159
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,119
I will write your foundation
a cheque for £10,000...

160
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:05,399
Praise the Lord.

161
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,879
<i>..</i> .If you agree to look kindly
on Arthur and to help him.

162
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,079
I need to look after everyone
in the family.

163
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:18,079
Do we have a deal?

164
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,799
Your money will be spent
to do good around the world. <i>..</i>

165
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,119
...and a mission will be named
after you.

166
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,399
But I'm only agreeing
to help him...

167
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,759
<i>...not</i> sleep with him.

168
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,359
No.

169
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:40,919
No, I imagine the negotiation
for that particular favour

170
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,279
would take a considerable
amount of time. <i>..</i>

171
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,919
<i>..</i> .And I have an appointment.

172
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,759
God bless.

173
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,839
Apologies for
the initial misunderstanding.

174
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:18,199
My brother dealt with <i>it.</i>

175
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,679
For the care you took.

176
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,879
Even though
I succumbed to temptation?

177
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:34,119
Part of the reason my brother
is back dealing with it

178
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:35,839
is down to you.

179
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:37,279
You spoke to him.

180
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,599
As a comrade.

181
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:40,199
The beating
is still owed to you.

182
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,079
Do you still do that kind
of work yourself,

183
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:43,719
Thomas Shelby, MP?

184
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:48,799
Mr Stagg, you see,
I can use men like you.

185
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,399
I have friends
that are in need of guns.

186
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,439
Soon, there will be a shipment
of Thompson sub-machine guns

187
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:02,119
coming here from Boston.

188
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,199
And I need you to unload
and store those weapons.

189
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:09,479
There will also be
ammunition...

190
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,079
...like this.

191
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:14,519
You have a good look.

192
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,759
And I need you
to take better care

193
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,639
of the guns and ammunition

194
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,319
than you did of the powder.

195
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:23,599
You understand?

196
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,639
Previously,

197
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,119
all of my import and export
went through Belfast docks.

198
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:33,079
Now we're dealing
with Boston. <i>..</i>

199
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,799
...I'm considering shifting
my supply line to Liverpool.

200
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,439
You'll be a very rich man.

201
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,359
Don'<i>t</i> you ever say thank you?

202
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,559
Thank you.

203
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,679
Is that <i>why</i> you do it,
Mr Shelby?

204
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:18,319
Is that <i>why</i> you keep
all this going?

205
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:20,439
To have people say thank you?

206
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:24,039
You could close all this down.

207
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,439
You could leave the sport
behind.

208
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,519
You could live like
an ordinary mortal man.

209
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,159
On your gravestone -

210
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,039
"an ordinary mortal man".

211
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,279
But, instead,

212
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,879
you still go round collecting
"please" and "thank you"

213
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:44,079
and "sorry"
and "forgive me, Mr Shelby".

214
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,359
That what it's all for?

215
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,239
You want to know?

216
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,159
You want to know
<i>why</i> I've carried on. <i>..</i>

217
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:57,599
<i>..</i> .all these years?

218
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,279
It's so I can do this.

219
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,639
And then...

220
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,159
...do this.

221
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,079
Feel it?

222
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:18,319
I feel it.

223
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,479
Junk doesn't even come close.

224
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,279
Soon, Mr Stagg...

225
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:32,479
<i>..</i> .when my last bit of business
is done...

226
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,119
...I will indeed...

227
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:39,439
...be an ordinary mortal man.

228
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,759
You have a good day.

229
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,239
Arthur, we've got a problem
with a referee.

230
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,759
He's not taking the money.

231
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,479
He's fucking religious
or something.

232
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,359
Jesus Christ.

233
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,479
With Tommy away, you're in
charge of gambling, Arthur,

234
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,679
what shall we do?

235
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:08,799
"And this they said to him,

236
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:12,479
"that they may have some charge
to bring against him."

237
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,839
Arthur, this referee,

238
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,279
he's threatening
to go to the police. <i>..</i>

239
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:17,399
"Jesus...

240
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,159
"...bent down,

241
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:23,439
"and with one finger,
he wrote on the ground. <i>.."</i>

242
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,719
Arthur...brother...

243
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,519
<i>..</i> .people are laughing at you.

244
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,479
So I just phoned
our holy referee again.

245
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,879
He basically told me
to fuck off.

246
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:40,399
Not even basically, actually.

247
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,119
He literally just told me <i>to...</i>

248
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:44,119
- ...to fuck off.
- Is that right?

249
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,759
So, do you know?

250
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:48,359
Oh, for fuck's sake.

251
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:50,279
Do you know what he wrote
on the ground?

252
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:51,359
- Hmm?
- No.

253
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:52,399
- Do you know?
- No.

254
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:53,919
- You don'<i>t</i> know, do you?
- No, I don't.

255
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,799
Billy, do you know
what he wrote on the ground?

256
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,199
- I ...
- Hmm?

257
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,119
Do you know what Jesus wrote
on the ground?

258
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:01,719
He bent down,

259
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,839
and with one finger,
he wrote on the fucking ground.

260
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,959
Do you know?
Do you know what he wrote?

261
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:09,199
- Come on, Billy.
- No.

262
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,519
Arthur, what should we do?

263
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:14,439
Go and get me the referee.

264
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,239
Bring me the fucking referee.

265
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,039
I know she's here with us.

266
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,439
Always.

267
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,959
But still,
it's just you and me.

268
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:49,759
I thought it'd be good

269
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:51,519
if we were
in a different place.

270
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,399
I hate that house now.

271
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:58,319
I wish I could blow it up.

272
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,359
There was a time when we'd say
nothing afterwards

273
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:14,359
because we didn'<i>t</i> have
to say anything.

274
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:20,519
Now we've got nothing left
to say.

275
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,199
There's business.

276
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:32,679
What business?

277
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,759
The American.

278
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,159
He's coming to Birmingham.

279
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,399
He's stopping over
on his <i>way to</i> Liverpool.

280
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:47,959
He's staying with us
tomorrow night.

281
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,239
Frances knows.

282
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,839
She's been making up a menu.

283
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:55,999
And then...

284
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,119
<i>...we</i> have to make a move.

285
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,799
Do you want to know
what that move is, Lizzie?

286
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,719
No.

287
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,279
I know enough.

288
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,239
Your book of regrets.

289
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:24,599
23, 24...

290
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:27,119
...52, 55.

291
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:31,359
The combination to the safe.

292
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:36,359
Regrets.

293
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:38,999
And I'm on there.

294
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,079
I'm on the list.

295
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:45,159
On the very top of the list.

296
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,879
Yep.

297
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,479
Yes, you are.

298
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,799
I regret marrying you, Lizzie.

299
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:05,319
Cos I've put you through
so much.

300
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,879
Put you through all of this.

301
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:10,479
Ruby.

302
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,119
Everything that is to come.

303
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,759
When you married me,

304
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,239
you married a man
and you married a curse.

305
00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:23,919
You have shared my fate.

306
00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:28,919
That is my regret.

307
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,599
But know this, Lizzie.

308
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,199
In this moment,

309
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,719
in this room...

310
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,599
...I love you.

311
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:53,799
You sound like
you're ticking a fucking box,

312
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,199
and I don'<i>t</i> know
what's inside the box!

313
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,919
Never have you let me in. <i>..</i>

314
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:08,239
<i>..</i> .Even though I know
the combination to the safe.

315
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:49,279
So this is him, is it?

316
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:53,199
The one who likes
to be fucking difficult, eh?

317
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,319
When I leave this place,

318
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:55,879
I'm going straight
to the police.

319
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:57,719
- You are?
- This man pointed a gun at me.

320
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:00,519
- Who, him there?
- Yeah.

321
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,479
Well, let's phone the police,
eh?

322
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:07,679
Don'<i>t worry.</i>

323
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:08,919
We'll have this sorted out
for you.

324
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,039
Hello?

325
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,479
Yes, get me the police.

326
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:15,039
Reports of a man
with a revolver on Watery Lane.

327
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:16,959
There you go.

328
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,639
And you ask for Inspector Moss.

329
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,599
Chief Superintendent Moss.

330
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:29,199
He's in charge of Watery Lane
and Bordesley Green.

331
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,959
That's right.

332
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,239
And you see this?

333
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,999
That's his betting credit
with us.

334
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:42,039
He makes a lot of money
from football matches. <i>..</i>

335
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:46,759
...because we give him
the results before the match.

336
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,479
On Saturday afternoon,

337
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,919
you take this whistle,
and you blow.

338
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,839
You give a penalty
to Birmingham City

339
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,119
in the final minute.

340
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:06,599
The goalkeeper will let
the penalty go by him,

341
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:09,479
and Birmingham City will win
1-0.

342
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,679
All you got to do is...

343
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:20,239
No.

344
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:22,959
I won'<i>t</i> do <i>it.</i>

345
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:25,999
If the police won'<i>t</i> listen,
I'll go to the newspapers.

346
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,199
I'm not afraid.

347
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,239
I was in France.

348
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,839
Phone Tommy, Arthur.

349
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:35,839
You shut up.

350
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:39,119
I'm not phoning fucking Tommy.

351
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:40,759
I am dealing with this, OK?

352
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:43,239
- I'm leaving.
- You're going fucking nowhere.

353
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:45,879
It's time one of us stood up
to you people.

354
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,839
It's not right
what's been happening.

355
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:51,879
I will not take money to cheat.

356
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:53,399
Fucking hell.

357
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,559
In France, I ran at the wire. <i>..</i>

358
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,439
<i>..</i> .And I was not afraid.

359
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,119
I am not afraid.

360
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:04,439
I won'<i>t</i> do a bad thing.

361
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:07,479
I've seen too many bad things.

362
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:11,359
A beating will make
no difference.

363
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:16,999
I know that, cos I can see it
in your fucking eyes.

364
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,999
Fuck him.

365
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:22,279
"In the bleak midwinter. <i>.."</i>

366
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:23,679
Holy Mary, mother of God.

367
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,559
- Agh!
- Right, Billy Boy.

368
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,199
You've been in the family
long enough.

369
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,399
- No...
- Yeah.

370
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,639
It's time for you

371
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,279
- to get bloodied.
- Arthur, you can'<i>t.</i>

372
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:34,399
Arthur, please...

373
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,479
You've been with us
long enough.

374
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:37,599
Fuck, Arthur. Jesus Christ.

375
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:40,119
I can'<i>t</i> be that man,
Arthur, please!

376
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:43,519
Either <i>two</i> men die today,
Billy...or one.

377
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:44,679
You fucking decide.

378
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:49,479
- Hate him, Billy. Hate him.
- Please...

379
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:50,599
Try. You don'<i>t</i> know him, Billy.

380
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:51,919
He's fucking laughing at you,
look.

381
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:53,759
Come on, hate him.

382
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:56,239
Look him in the eyes, man.
Look him in the eyes.

383
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:58,279
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Look him in the eyes.

384
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:01,439
I'm sorry...sorry.

385
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:17,119
Enough. Enough, enough, enough.

386
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,079
It's all right. Billy, Billy,
come on, come on.

387
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:27,399
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

388
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,559
Look at you. Look. <i>..</i>

389
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,039
Look at you, look.

390
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:34,239
Huh?

391
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:38,239
You're bloodied now, Billy.

392
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:41,519
You're bloodied now.

393
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,559
You're not going to heaven
no more.

394
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,359
They won'<i>t</i> let you in.

395
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,399
Isiah,
you take him to the foundry.

396
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:56,119
You ask for Mr Patches,
all right?

397
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:58,479
You tell him we got some fuel
for the furnace.

398
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,079
Who the fuck are you?

399
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:37,959
- I hear...
- Please.

400
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:40,999
<i>...you</i>'re the informant
inside the Shelby organisation.

401
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,639
And who the fuck I am...

402
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,319
<i>..</i> .is the man you now work for.

403
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:49,359
Please, please.

404
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:51,439
I have something
I need you to do,

405
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,759
and I want to impress
upon you...

406
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:54,039
<i>...to impress...</i>

407
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,199
<i>..</i> .Upon you the seriousness
of my intent.

408
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:00,599
Cos, you see, I used to do

409
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:02,359
this kind of thing
for a living.

410
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:06,239
And sometimes
I kind of miss it.

411
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:09,639
Just like Mr Shelby,
I miss the...

412
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:12,359
<i>...the</i> wave of electricity
you get under your scalp.

413
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:15,959
I miss the taste like metal
on the tip of your tongue.

414
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,799
I'm about to give you
an instruction.

415
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:22,519
You do as I say,
you stay a man.

416
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:26,359
Fail, and I will send people
to serve your balls to you

417
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:27,759
on a china plate.

418
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:32,039
I'll do what you say.

419
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:35,999
A decision's been taken.

420
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:38,999
My associates are going
to take care of Tommy Shelby,

421
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:43,039
and you are going to give us up
his brother, Arthur.

422
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:45,839
Do you understand?

423
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:49,679
Yes! Yes! Fucking yes! Please!

424
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:57,079
Only information leading
to the murder of Arthur Shelby

425
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:59,399
will save you
from an Italian death.

426
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,359
Cos it was the Italians
that taught me that

427
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:04,799
above God, above children,

428
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,799
above his wife
and above his mother...

429
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,719
...most of all,
a man loves his balls.

430
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:23,279
Hello, Arthur.

431
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:36,759
I think we should pray.

432
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,199
That's how we begin this.

433
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,719
You'd like to pray?

434
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:44,199
The prayer I've chosen

435
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:46,639
is the Act of Contrition,
Version 2.

436
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,599
So, you're Catholic now, Linda?

437
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,519
You're Catholic.
Quakers don'<i>t</i> pray.

438
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:58,759
Bow your head, Arthur,
and close your eyes.

439
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:02,039
And recite the prayer.

440
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,719
You know it well
from when you were boy.

441
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,479
Oh, my mind's all dried up
with junk, though,

442
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:08,199
and shot full of fuck...

443
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,719
...shot full of holes.

444
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:14,199
Linda, please.

445
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:18,719
It's in there somewhere,
Arthur. It's like a song.

446
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:19,919
Yeah.

447
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,359
Somewhere.

448
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:23,919
Together, we'll find <i>it.</i>

449
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:26,639
Digging for the words
will help clean your soul.

450
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,559
I'll begin it.

451
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:35,239
Forgive me my sins, O, Lord,
forgive me my sins.

452
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:37,199
The sins of my youth.

453
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:39,439
The sins of my youth,

454
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,039
the sins of my age,

455
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:42,399
the sins of my soul.

456
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,999
The sins of my body.

457
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:50,159
The sins I know,
the sins I know not.

458
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:53,719
The sins I have concealed
for so long.

459
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,919
For so fu...

460
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,279
For so long.

461
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:19,199
Caught him stealing a car,

462
00:34:19,319 --> 00:34:22,279
and he's got a stack of cash
from the betting shop.

463
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,679
Steal from who you <i>want.</i>

464
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:38,919
But don'<i>t</i> steal from me.

465
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:42,599
Here you are.

466
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:46,439
Get a train

467
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:48,319
to wherever the fuck
you want to go. Get out.

468
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:50,359
- I don'<i>t</i> ride trains.
- That a fact?

469
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:55,559
Well, Curly has
a <i>two</i>-wheeled wagon.

470
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,999
What am I, a tinker?

471
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,639
I need four wheels.

472
00:34:59,759 --> 00:35:02,439
And a horse for the hills.

473
00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:07,719
Which hills?

474
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,559
All of them.
All the hills of England.

475
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:16,679
Why do you want to leave?

476
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,039
I didn'<i>t</i> take to that work
in the betting shop.

477
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:28,399
Well, you heard him, Charlie.

478
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,279
Get my dad's old four-wheeled
wagon and <i>two</i> strong ponies.

479
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:33,519
Right.

480
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,239
Curly! Get here.

481
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:44,399
Before you go,

482
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:46,519
do you want to know the truth
about yourself?

483
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,479
No. Who does?

484
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:53,959
Right, well,
I'm going to tell you.

485
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,599
That spring at Appleby Fair,

486
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:58,719
your mother stole
my watch and chain.

487
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:00,519
You're from a long line
of thieves.

488
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,719
The watch had the words
"Saxon Shore" carved in it.

489
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,359
Stole it meself from a drunk
when I was a kid.

490
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:10,799
I imagine she told you

491
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,359
your dad was the Duke
of the Saxon Shore. Well...

492
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:16,359
...I'm the Duke,

493
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:17,719
It was my watch.

494
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:19,999
I'm your father.

495
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:23,599
That's the truth.

496
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:25,959
When her dad found out,

497
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,639
he shot me in the chest
with a squirrel gun.

498
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:34,519
A scar and a stolen watch
and a story she made up.

499
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,999
That's all you need to know
about yourself

500
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:39,599
before you get on the road.

501
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:54,399
Esme tells me
the spirits favour you.

502
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,919
That the spirit is in you.

503
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:00,679
She tried to sell me like one
of those horses, didn'<i>t</i> she?

504
00:37:01,759 --> 00:37:04,039
How much did she pay for me?

505
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:06,799
I've no use for gold any more.

506
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,439
But if you <i>are</i> a horse,

507
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:11,039
you're in the right place.

508
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,759
Curly!

509
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,639
Curly, hurry up!

510
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:20,359
This boy has hills to climb.

511
00:37:23,479 --> 00:37:24,919
I remember that watch.

512
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:28,959
Oh, yeah?

513
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:32,079
She used to wear it
over her heart.

514
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:37,119
We buried it with her.

515
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:40,999
Tom.

516
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,999
The old wagon's right
front wheel is fucked, Tom.

517
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:45,399
It's standing in the <i>wet.</i>

518
00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:47,999
Put a new wheel on, Curly.

519
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:52,079
Yeah.

520
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,159
Fix wagons here.

521
00:37:57,959 --> 00:38:00,519
Good families
come from the New Forest

522
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,479
to get their wagons fixed

523
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:04,799
and fresh horses
before the fairs.

524
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,519
Yeah. Yeah, I like it here.

525
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:13,439
I like it better than
that betting shop.

526
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:17,359
Why?

527
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:19,559
People.

528
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:21,879
People piss me off.

529
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,879
There are a lot of people
in that betting shop.

530
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:29,799
So far, here... What?
I've only counted <i>two.</i>

531
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:30,919
Mm-hm.

532
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:33,159
Charlie and Curly.

533
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:34,999
The rest is dogs and horses.

534
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,799
Curly's half horse himself.

535
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:39,439
Dogs are OK.

536
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:42,519
Horses are better than people,
mind you.

537
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,239
There's work here
for a man who knows horses.

538
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:52,879
Unknown.

539
00:38:54,279 --> 00:38:56,559
I want to remain
completely unknown.

540
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:57,599
Well, you'd be

541
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:58,759
in the right place
for that as well.

542
00:38:58,879 --> 00:38:59,999
No-one knows anyone here.

543
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:04,279
Hey, mister!
Save that wheel a minute.

544
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:07,639
Where would I stay?

545
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,319
Stables,
with the other stallions.

546
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:15,239
Now that Finn is married off,

547
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,239
plenty of girls round here.

548
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,839
Fathers are mostly unarmed.

549
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:27,039
I have a future for you, Duke.

550
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:30,519
You already have a son.

551
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:34,199
My business has <i>two</i> sides.

552
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,759
Light and dark.

553
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,759
I'll need someone for each.

554
00:39:40,799 --> 00:39:42,519
And I'm dark, am I?

555
00:39:43,999 --> 00:39:46,759
I've realised we don'<i>t</i> get
to choose which one we are.

556
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:49,639
Dark knows dark.

557
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:53,599
And my affairs,
both light and dark. <i>..</i>

558
00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:56,439
<i>..</i> .Will need settling soon.

559
00:39:58,359 --> 00:39:59,399
Curly!

560
00:40:00,479 --> 00:40:03,799
Find a shovel for the Duke
of the Saxon Shore here.

561
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:05,799
Get him shovelling shit.

562
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,959
And put some petrol
in the boat.

563
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:11,079
I'm off to meet a lady
in Solihull.

564
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:51,959
Take a look at her.

565
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:56,399
Now imagine ten people
living on side.

566
00:40:58,439 --> 00:41:00,119
Step on. Have a look inside.

567
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:08,999
I've had a response
from the Guinness Trust

568
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,079
about building
charitable housing

569
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:15,319
at <i>two</i> sites
along the canal network

570
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,039
between London,

571
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,799
Birmingham and Liverpool.

572
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:22,639
This lock here would be
the one of the sites.

573
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,959
I have the permission.
Just need the finance.

574
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:31,439
I know that you and your
husband, Bryan Guinness,

575
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:32,599
are estranged,

576
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:35,279
but I understand
you still have influence

577
00:41:35,399 --> 00:41:36,519
in the Guinness family.

578
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:40,279
Your support might help them
make their decision.

579
00:41:40,399 --> 00:41:41,799
Will you help me?

580
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:53,999
I've booked a suite in a hotel
a mile from here.

581
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,799
My chauffeur
will take us there.

582
00:41:58,759 --> 00:41:59,919
You look quite the thing

583
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:02,719
dressed like that,
dressed like a working man.

584
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:04,279
They'll probably show you
to the coalhouse

585
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:06,239
to make your delivery.

586
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:08,599
Yep, they probably will.

587
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:13,759
Oswald has fucked your wife,

588
00:42:13,879 --> 00:42:16,479
so my suggestion is
about balance and proportion.

589
00:42:17,759 --> 00:42:18,959
It would be only fair.

590
00:42:22,399 --> 00:42:24,199
Can I assume...

591
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:26,679
...I have your support?

592
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,679
This isn'<i>t</i> about
charitable housing -

593
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:34,239
this is about changing
the world.

594
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,199
It's about a different kind
of trust.

595
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:39,239
Absolute trust.

596
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,559
We have important work
ahead of us.

597
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:46,479
It's much harder to lie
with your body

598
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:47,799
than with your words.

599
00:42:49,279 --> 00:42:50,519
This, I have learnt.

600
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:00,479
Mostly,
I do whatever I want to do.

601
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,839
Sometimes,
I do things for the cause.

602
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:05,919
In this case, it's both.

603
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:10,279
Come.

604
00:43:36,879 --> 00:43:38,879
In the interests
of absolute clarity,

605
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:40,479
that is simply

606
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:43,119
the English aristocracy's <i>way</i>
of shaking hands.

607
00:43:46,759 --> 00:43:47,759
So...

608
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:50,039
...welcome.

609
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,519
<i>If you do this thing...</i>

610
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:42,279
<i>...the possibility of war,
you have to consider.</i>

611
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:49,079
<i>It was the ambitions</i>

612
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:51,399
<i>and strategies of one man
that caused this.</i>

613
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:57,599
<i>There will be a war
in this family,</i>

614
00:46:57,719 --> 00:47:00,159
<i>and one of you will die.</i>

615
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:26,879
We need to leave early

616
00:47:26,999 --> 00:47:29,239
to catch the first train
to Liverpool, yes?

617
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:30,919
Yep.

618
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:33,079
So we eat early, finish early.

619
00:47:38,359 --> 00:47:40,199
You changed the combination
of the safe.

620
00:47:41,439 --> 00:47:42,519
Why?

621
00:47:43,759 --> 00:47:45,039
Have you got new secrets?

622
00:47:46,279 --> 00:47:48,159
With the new business
at hand...

623
00:47:49,479 --> 00:47:50,639
<i>..</i> .there are some things. <i>..</i>

624
00:47:51,799 --> 00:47:53,199
<i>...that</i> I cannot share.

625
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:55,479
What things?

626
00:48:00,759 --> 00:48:02,119
What are those tablets?

627
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:03,759
Doctor gave them me.

628
00:48:03,879 --> 00:48:05,479
Painkillers?

629
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,799
- Yeah.
- What pain?

630
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:11,679
Any pain that comes, Lizzie.

631
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:36,719
When you're ready, I want you
to tell me everything

632
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:38,039
that's going on.

633
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:42,879
It's like the clock's
stopped ticking

634
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:45,079
and I'm waiting
for the bomb to explode.

635
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,119
We're in that quiet minute.

636
00:48:57,479 --> 00:48:58,839
Tommy?

637
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:09,679
That's where we live now.

638
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:12,679
When I know everything...

639
00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:16,279
<i>...</i> I will tell you everything.

640
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:35,079
Oh, no,
Gina's running wild, you see.

641
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:37,879
Harrods, dope, amphetamines,
lords and ladies,

642
00:49:37,999 --> 00:49:39,999
you know, the whole
English aristocracy thing.

643
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:42,399
Fuck wine - whiskey.

644
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:44,279
Shelby, you having whiskey?

645
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:46,359
- I'll stay on wine.
- Fuck wine, more whiskey.

646
00:49:46,479 --> 00:49:49,999
I'm celebrating.
Celebration, you know.

647
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:51,519
Getting off
this fucking island.

648
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:52,959
You see,
the thing with England,

649
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:55,519
the currency here,
it's not money.

650
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:58,159
Nah, you got bored of money
a long time ago.

651
00:49:59,439 --> 00:50:00,879
Cos, you know,
anyone can have money,

652
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:02,319
you can fucking...

653
00:50:04,759 --> 00:50:07,239
<i>...you</i> can fucking find money
in the mud.

654
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,239
You can forge money.

655
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,759
Mr Shelby, you can steal money,
am I right?

656
00:50:13,959 --> 00:50:15,199
The currency here...

657
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:17,439
...it's blood.

658
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:22,799
And Mr Shelby knows that
better than all of them.

659
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:23,879
Blood here is like wine,

660
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:25,559
like the vintage wine
in that bottle.

661
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:28,079
It's the. <i>.. It</i>'s the label,
it's the terroir,

662
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:30,399
it's the grape
that makes the wine.

663
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:32,199
Who fucking cares
about the glass around it?

664
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,639
And you, my friend,
you're an American.

665
00:50:35,759 --> 00:50:37,599
You fucking...
...smash the glass,

666
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:38,999
you spill the blood

667
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,359
and you spend their currency
to get what you <i>want.</i>

668
00:50:42,479 --> 00:50:43,919
Am I right?

669
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:47,999
When you come to America,

670
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:50,519
I will show you things.

671
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:52,319
You're going to America?

672
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,239
To Canada, Lizzie, to collect
payment for the shipment.

673
00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:00,119
I need to do it myself.

674
00:51:01,279 --> 00:51:02,799
And who will be going with you?

675
00:51:02,919 --> 00:51:05,359
Michael will be there
to watch his back.

676
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,999
Another journey, Tommy?

677
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:10,319
$5 million, Mrs Shelby.

678
00:51:10,439 --> 00:51:12,479
It's worth a little cruise,
don'<i>t</i> you think?

679
00:51:16,399 --> 00:51:18,039
You know whiskey does talk. <i>..</i>

680
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:21,239
...Mr Nelson,
and sometimes whiskey is. <i>..</i>

681
00:51:22,359 --> 00:51:23,879
<i>..</i> .Very eloquent.

682
00:51:25,439 --> 00:51:29,359
But $5 million, Mr Nelson...

683
00:51:31,439 --> 00:51:32,639
<i>...that</i> is a legacy.

684
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:38,399
And when I come back,
I will know everything.

685
00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:45,959
I see myself so clearly
in you, Thomas Shelby.

686
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:50,439
You are a man with a bright
and glittering future.

687
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:56,519
Mr Shelby, there's
a car coming up the drive.

688
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:58,119
A Rolls-Royce.

689
00:51:58,239 --> 00:51:59,679
Were you expecting more guests?

690
00:52:01,759 --> 00:52:02,919
No.

691
00:52:10,399 --> 00:52:11,839
Excuse me.

692
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,839
We were on our <i>way</i>
to my constituency in Smethwick

693
00:52:21,959 --> 00:52:23,679
and I heard our American friend

694
00:52:23,799 --> 00:52:26,159
was in Birmingham
and that he was coming here,

695
00:52:26,279 --> 00:52:29,799
so we came
to say one last farewell.

696
00:52:32,919 --> 00:52:35,479
Champagne.
We have much to celebrate.

697
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:45,959
It isn'<i>t that</i> I wasn'<i>t</i> sure
Mr Shelby would give you

698
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,119
an excellent send-off,

699
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:52,119
I just felt, since telegrams
and wires and letters

700
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:54,359
can so easily be intercepted,

701
00:52:54,479 --> 00:52:56,239
we might confirm
all that we've achieved

702
00:52:56,359 --> 00:52:57,719
during your visit

703
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,199
over champagne.

704
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:01,319
It is remarkable

705
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:03,839
how quickly our relationships
have developed.

706
00:53:03,959 --> 00:53:06,519
So many triangles in this room.

707
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:09,959
Everyone except from Mr Nelson
is the point of a triangle.

708
00:53:10,959 --> 00:53:13,479
How am I part of a triangle?

709
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,239
Mr Nelson,
you have all that you came for?

710
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,919
I have confirmation
that the future of Europe

711
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:22,559
is in the hands
of men like yourselves.

712
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:27,479
And that urgent conversations
between Washington, Rome,

713
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,519
and of course Berlin
can now begin.

714
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:34,359
A two-week visit that may have
changed the course of history.

715
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:37,199
We all got what we wanted.

716
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:38,679
Yes.

717
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,319
And I got what I have wanted

718
00:53:40,439 --> 00:53:42,399
from the moment
I set eyes on <i>it.</i>

719
00:53:47,999 --> 00:53:50,919
Elizabeth,
you are a very lucky woman. <i>..</i>

720
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:55,839
<i>...to</i> have each day
what I have only sampled once.

721
00:54:18,999 --> 00:54:20,399
Forgive us, Mr Nelson,

722
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:22,119
that was a necessary bit
of housekeeping.

723
00:54:27,999 --> 00:54:29,079
Thomas...

724
00:54:30,879 --> 00:54:32,999
<i>...we</i> do so hate
to be indiscreet, but. <i>..</i>

725
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,039
<i>...we</i> have told you
many times,

726
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:37,319
if you are to seek power

727
00:54:37,439 --> 00:54:40,799
in these days
of shiny magazines

728
00:54:40,919 --> 00:54:43,159
and society photographs,

729
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:45,519
sooner or later,
you will have to find a spouse

730
00:54:45,639 --> 00:54:46,839
who's more suitable.

731
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:50,079
A woman with Lizzie's past

732
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:52,759
and personal history
really isn'<i>t</i> suitable.

733
00:54:55,279 --> 00:54:57,199
She doesn'<i>t</i> deserve you,
Mr Shelby.

734
00:55:21,399 --> 00:55:22,959
You know, the thing is,
Mosley...

735
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:25,759
<i>...you</i>'re right.

736
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:30,719
You're right,
she doesn't deserve me.

737
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,119
She doesn'<i>t</i> deserve what I am.

738
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:42,319
She doesn't deserve
what I will become.

739
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:44,039
What will you become?

740
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,639
Truth is, I belong here,
at this table,

741
00:55:47,759 --> 00:55:49,679
with fuckers like you.

742
00:55:51,919 --> 00:55:53,319
She doesn't.

743
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,839
For all I <i>try to</i> hide <i>it...</i>

744
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:02,439
<i>...</i> I'm just one of you.

745
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,559
Could there be a sadder ending,
eh?

746
00:57:10,479 --> 00:57:11,879
I'm here on behalf
of your wife, Gina,

747
00:57:11,999 --> 00:57:13,319
and Jack Nelson.

748
00:57:13,439 --> 00:57:15,959
Mr Nelson's prepared
to get you out of here.

749
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,679
But first he needs an answer
to a question.

750
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:22,759
If the answer is yes. <i>..</i>

751
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:25,439
...you'll be released.

752
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:29,119
If the answer is no. <i>..</i>

753
00:57:30,439 --> 00:57:31,639
<i>...you</i>'ll <i>stay.</i>

754
00:57:34,959 --> 00:57:36,439
I have consulted my mother.

755
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:38,839
Your mother's dead.

756
00:57:41,479 --> 00:57:43,199
Nevertheless,
I have consulted her.

757
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:47,839
And yes.

758
00:57:49,479 --> 00:57:50,559
When I'm released,

759
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:52,719
it is my intention
to kill Tommy Shelby.
