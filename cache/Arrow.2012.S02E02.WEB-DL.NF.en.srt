463
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,631
I'm sorry about you and Carly.

464
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,386
Yeah, well, couples break up.

465
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:01,016
Not everything that happens
in Starling City is your responsibility.

466
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,976
I'm learning that.

467
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,979
What I meant was I'm sorry
that I wasn't there for you.

468
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,023
Because I should have been.

469
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,192
I got wrapped up in my own suffering...

470
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:15,238
...and I forgot that some other people
might be suffering too.

471
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,746
We're getting dangerously close
to hug territory, so I'm gonna fall back.

472
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,247
You need a ride?

473
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:29,044
Turns out that being CEO,
I actually have some work to do.

474
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,129
I'll find my own way.

475
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,423
You always do.

476
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,761
MAN [ON TV]: <i>Back in Starling City, Oliver
Queen finds himself in the hot seat once more.</i>

477
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,847
<i>At least in the eyes of city alderman,
Sebastian Blood.</i>

478
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:45,101
SEBASTIAN: <i>Oliver Queen's failure to show up
to his own benefit shouldn't surprise anyone.</i>

479
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:49,230
<i>He's no different than the Starling City elite
who've failed to show up...</i>

480
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:53,276
<i>...when it comes to ending the suffering
of those left devastated in the Glades.</i>

481
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:58,114
<i>Oliver Queen is not a friend
of the people of this city.</i>

482
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,290
One.

483
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:32,190
To those men, this location could have been
on any one of 150 different islands.

484
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,944
But for somebody who knows this island
like he knows his own name...

485
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:39,072
So those men were looking for this place.

486
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,199
-Why?
-That would be the question.

487
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:43,159
OLIVER:
Slade?

488
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,328
Over here.

489
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,319
SHADO:
The skulls are misshapen.

490
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,449
What happened to these people?

491
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:29,831
Whatever did happen to them
was over 60 years ago.

492
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,501
These soldiers belonged
to the Japanese Imperial Army.

493
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,380
SHADO:
They've been here since World War II.

494
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:40,884
SLADE:
We're missing something here.

495
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,512
You don't just come here for corpses.

496
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,792
I've been looking for you.

497
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,170
-You need to stop.
-You saved my life.

498
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,090
Made me realize...

499
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,592
...it wasn't much of a life.

500
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:28,598
That I could do what others couldn't,
were too afraid to do.

501
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,018
I could help you save the city.

502
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,103
-You're untrained.
-I can fight.

503
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,190
You can take a beating. There's a difference.

504
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,150
Then teach me.

505
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:41,820
Let me help you.

506
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,032
Okay. You can help me.

507
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:49,536
But not by taking on the Triad or the cops.

508
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,329
Then how?

509
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:54,165
To do what I do, I need intel.

510
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,001
You can be my eyes and ears in the Glades.

511
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:01,422
-That's how you can save the city.
-How do I contact you?

512
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,846
Leave that in the alley wall...

513
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,098
...and I'll know to contact you.

514
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,273
You sure it's all right that I keep this?

515
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,910
If I wanna be with you,
do I keep that or give it back?

516
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,328
You were a little unclear.

517
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,498
-You mean it?
-No more fighting.

518
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:39,544
If it's a choice between life with you
or life without you...

519
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,422
...life with you will win every single time.

520
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,134
I'm done trying to be a hero.

521
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,574
I told you to stay away from me.

522
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,911
GREEN ARROW: I thought
you might have changed your mind...

523
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,330
...after I stopped the men
terrorizing our city.

524
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,041
This isn't your city. It's your killing fields.

525
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,085
-The copycats are still alive.
-Tommy Merlyn isn't.

526
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,048
I lost a friend that day too.

527
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,885
And I would gladly...

528
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,845
...have given my life for his.

529
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:33,139
Well, don't worry. Your life is over.

530
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,185
Your life as a free man.

531
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,780
I told you to stay away.
Somehow I knew you wouldn't listen.
