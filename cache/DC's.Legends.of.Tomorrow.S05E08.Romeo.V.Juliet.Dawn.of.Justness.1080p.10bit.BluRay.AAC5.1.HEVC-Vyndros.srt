1
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:03,211
[Ray] Previously
on Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:06,298
- I plan on asking Nora to marry me.
-[Nora] Yes.

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,258
You don't understand
how dangerous that Loom is, John-o.

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,510
Come on, Charlie.
We use the Loom to help Astra,

5
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,346
and then I will help you
destroy it forever. Deal?

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,348
Someone's trashing
Rebecca Silver online.

7
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:16,433
[Zari] Cute. You have a troll.

8
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,059
- This your kid?
- She's your kid, too.

9
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,853
<i>[Damien] Nora belongs
in the real world...</i>

10
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:21,062
I need you to support her.

11
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,606
<i>And she can't do it
on that ship of yours.</i>

12
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,690
Do the right thing, son.

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,168
Morning, babe.

14
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:45,587
Hey.

15
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:48,590
You okay?

16
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,551
Actually, I was thinking about your dad.

17
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:53,929
That's romantic.

18
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,389
Thinking about something he said to me.

19
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,559
When I committed my life to you,

20
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:01,811
I meant it.

21
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,438
So I've been thinking...

22
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,900
maybe our life together
isn't on this ship.

23
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:12,072
Maybe it's time for us
to move on.., and move out.

24
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,448
Together.

25
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,826
Oh, hey.

26
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:21,206
Listen, I wanna build a life with you
wherever we are.

27
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,999
I know, but...

28
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,127
you can't really
do your job on a Timeship.

29
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,004
What about the Legends?

30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,881
They've become my family.

31
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,342
But we can't begin our life together...

32
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,887
when I literally have
one foot in the past.

33
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,891
So I think I'll do one last mission
with the team.

34
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,019
Say goodbye.

35
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,481
Wow.

36
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,276
Are we doing this?

37
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,528
Yeah.

38
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,322
- Okay.
- Okay.

39
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,282
Okay. [chuckles]

40
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,160
Mmm.

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,705
Yeah, but maybe
after we brush our teeth?

42
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,290
Okay.

43
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,793
[groans]

44
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,253
Come on! Is she still in there?

45
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,880
Zari, there's a line.

46
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,509
[Zari] I'm doing my hair. You can't stop
the glam routine mid-process.

47
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,428
[Sara] Come on, we talked about this!

48
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,097
- Ooh, let me guess. Zari?
- Uh-huh.

49
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,099
Hey, what happened
to the sign-up sheet I made?

50
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,936
Oh, Mick burned it in frustration
after Zari's last Korean Sheet Mask day.

51
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,399
Well, I guess now is as good a time
as any to tell you two that...

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,110
Nora and I have some big news.

53
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,446
We're talking big news?
Because, guys, I got a Whopper.

54
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,865
I told John we'll help him
find the Loom of Fate.

55
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:37,782
Nuh-uh. You know the rules.

56
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,201
No MacGuffin talk until after
I've finished my coffee.

57
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,662
Yeah. And besides, you guys were
about to make a big announcement?

58
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:43,580
Yes.

59
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,749
Is it time for morning announcements?
'Cause I need you all to know,

60
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,542
I have to go so badly.

61
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,545
If my sister ever leaves the bathroom!

62
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,463
- B!
- Come on.

63
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,841
[Zari] Hey, bro, let's not pretend like
you don't take this long with your hair.

64
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:55,967
Get in line.

65
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,636
Bathrooms are also for other things.

66
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,472
And in other announcements--

67
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,681
She still in there?

68
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,060
I would be too
if I had all that damn hair.

69
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,772
Okay, well, this is the perfect time,
now that we're all here,

70
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,442
to let you know that Nora and I--

71
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,402
- You're moving out.
- Mmm?

72
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,528
How'd you know that?

73
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,490
Well, you got married.
Next logical step in a relationship.

74
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,744
And by the way, I heard you two
going at it like Jackrabbits last night.

75
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,454
[Charlie] At least someone's
getting it.

76
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,538
Oh, my God.

77
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,750
Look, after one final mission...

78
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,336
Nora and I will be leaving.

79
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,754
- Aw, I'm gonna miss you, man.
- Wait. For real?

80
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,214
- Seriously?
-[Zari] Congrats.

81
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,174
I mean, we always knew
this day would come,

82
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,385
but I never thought it would be so soon.

83
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,594
How are you gonna tell Nate?

84
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,845
-[Nate] Tell Nate what?
- What?

85
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,309
Hmm?

86
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,689
The wait for the bathroom is upwards
of 30 minutes. Can you believe it?

87
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,899
Hey, take it easy.

88
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,485
At least I get to wait in line
with the happy new couple.

89
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:59,072
Nora, welcome to your
new morning routine. Uptown!

90
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,699
[door opens]

91
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,785
- Thank God.
- Good morning. Good morning.

92
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,412
Damn, she looks good.

93
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,664
Glam complete. [chuckles]

94
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,543
You guys could really
work on your hygiene.

95
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,128
It's 7115.

96
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,560
Mick! There you are.

97
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:30,979
Mona.

98
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,064
Consent to hug you?

99
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,357
[grunts]

100
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,734
I'll take that as a no.

101
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,862
So what's new?

102
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:43,700
Any torrid affairs, flourishing
romances, lovers left behind?

103
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,744
Rebecca Silver could always
use fresh inspiration.

104
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:47,871
No.

105
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,040
Anyway, had to be here
for Nora's first book club

106
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,417
as a married woman.

107
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,503
And speaking of books,
I could use your advice.

108
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,839
Rebecca Silver has been
besieged by a troll.

109
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,258
Forget about her. I mean "him." Whoever.

110
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,012
Well, I tried that, and it didn't stop.
I was thinking of reaching out.

111
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,347
Don't. It's just gonna
make you feel worse.

112
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,849
Well, I think it's a cry for help.

113
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,767
Maybe someone just needs
to show them love.

114
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,311
It's got nothing to do with love!

115
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,355
[door opens]

116
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,651
Hey. I was packing up my stuff
in the lab,

117
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,278
and I noticed
that Marie Antoinette is gone,

118
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,155
and the jars of Rasputin are empty.

119
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,365
Astra must have recalled
their souls to hell.

120
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,826
Damien said something
about "eternal torture."

121
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,621
So, um.., packing, huh?

122
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,289
You talk to Nate yet?

123
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:35,084
Ah. When I saw his face back there,
I just couldn't.

124
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,878
He was so excited
about us living together.

125
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,006
[sighs] I just have to wait
for the perfect moment, you know?

126
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,550
Look, I say just get it over with.

127
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,969
And then you guys can enjoy
your last "hoorah" together.

128
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,640
Yeah. Saying goodbye to Nate,
it's my biggest mission yet.

129
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,058
- Mmm-hmm.
-[scoffs]

130
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,936
I did go to the moon once,
so second biggest.

131
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,270
[clears throat]

132
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,148
The Loom of Fate.

133
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,734
Eons ago, I tossed it
through space and time...

134
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,903
because it was too dangerous.

135
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,989
But now, for all my sins, we're
gonna piece it back together again.

136
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,492
And finally put an end
to our Encore problem.

137
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,411
By rewriting Astra's life
and setting her on the right path.

138
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,414
Yeah, speaking of life changes...

139
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,296
Must be a life-changing experience
for you, Charlie,

140
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,007
to know that the Loom
is back on our Earth. [chuckles]

141
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,093
- Charlie?
- Yeah, it is.

142
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,554
But there's only one piece
whose spot I'm sure of.

143
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,514
I gave it to a close mate
of mine for safekeeping.

144
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,058
All right, so we'll go back
to right after you dropped it off.

145
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,810
That's our move.

146
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,854
And, uh, speaking of moves...

147
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,317
Let's get a move on it. [chuckles]

148
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,569
Where are we headed, Charlie?

149
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,322
Well, the last place I left it
was in London, 1594.

150
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,782
Gideon, set a course.

151
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:51,369
[Gideon] Affirmative, Captain.
And speaking of setting a new course...

152
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,247
Of course, she means...

153
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,042
Sara, please give us one of those
terrific period-specific send-offs.

154
00:06:59,127 --> 00:06:59,961
Fine.

155
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,174
Enjoy the jolly old London, you blokes!

156
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,179
That was.., that was bad.

157
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,973
And, frankly, offensive.

158
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,521
[lively music playing]

159
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,189
[both grunt]

160
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:24,277
Oh, it warms my cockles to know
that Londoners haven't changed a bit.

161
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,529
Let's find this bloody Loom piece,
shall we?

162
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,615
Well, I've disguised the pieces
as rings.

163
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,408
And this one, I gave
to a close mate of mine.

164
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,493
And if I know him, he'll be here.

165
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,245
Wasn't a day he didn't stop by
for a pint.

166
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,663
[Mick] Why stop at one pint?

167
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,791
Hmm. Well, found our guy.

168
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,126
Will the Quill.

169
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,046
You didn't tell me you were friends
with the real William Shakespeare.

170
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,589
[Charlie] I didn't wanna name-drop.

171
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,719
Pardon the intrusion, squire.

172
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,263
We have the knowledge
that you came into possession

173
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,350
of a particular ring
some several days past.

174
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,436
I know not of what you speak,
good constables.

175
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,605
And why should anyone hand me a ring?

176
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,315
Do I appear as a jeweler to thine eyes?

177
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:06,194
[yells] It's a pity! Because that ring
was stolen from the...

178
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,197
- Duke-
- And... And he wants it back!

179
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,531
And if it were to be discovered

180
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,076
that someone had lied
about its whereabouts...

181
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,829
let's just say, heads would roll.

182
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,749
[stutters] Yes! Yes, the ring.

183
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,876
- Ah.
- The ring. Now, I remember it well.

184
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,670
Would that I could yield it for you,

185
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,755
but I just sold that very ring
of which you speak.

186
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,216
What? You sold it already,
you lousy git?

187
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,884
[Shakespeare] It was by necessity.

188
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,845
See, a stubborn case of writer's block

189
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,600
is preventing me from finding the ending
to my new play, Romeo and Juliet.

190
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,519
Sounds like an instant classic.

191
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:43,231
My producer, Philip Henslowe,
has threatened to remove me of hands

192
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,525
by way of sword if I can't finish.

193
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:49,070
Thus, I gave him the ring in exchange
for more time.

194
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,781
If I can't bring my story to a close,

195
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,618
my career is over. [clears throat]

196
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,246
So much for quick and easy.

197
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:09,257
Discussing Romeo and <i>Juliet</i>
in Elizabethan England.

198
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,300
- Hmm.
- Ava, you needed me?

199
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,679
Sorry, is this an intervention?

200
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:18,933
No,no,no,no,no.
So, since you're a member of the team,

201
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,810
we wanted to invite you to book club!

202
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,019
-[all cheering softly]
- Oh.

203
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,356
That is very sweet, but I actually
have a lot on my plate right now,

204
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,984
so I don't really have time
to talk about books.

205
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,944
The thing about book club is, uh...

206
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,654
we don't really talk about books.

207
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:35,032
- Mmm-mmm.
- Because book club is magic.

208
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,952
What she means is,
book club is a place

209
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,705
where you can hang out with your friends
and talk about your problems.

210
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,790
- And eat tiny crackers!
- And drink.

211
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,128
Well, according to the ironmonger
at the bar,

212
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,631
for 20 shillings, I can get a bottle
of wine and a strumpet.

213
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,842
Also, Henslowe and his goons
just arrived,

214
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,093
and they're right over there.

215
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,679
[Charlie] Yeah,
I can see the ring on his hand.

216
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,015
I doubt he's gonna give it up so easily.

217
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,433
Ah, that's simple.

218
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,603
You distract the goons,
and I'll punch the producer in the face.

219
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,189
Anyone got 20 shillings?

220
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,316
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

221
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,318
This mission has to be epic. Okay?

222
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,614
By which I mean, extremely well
and elaborately coordinated.

223
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,199
Ray's right.

224
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,660
And I have the perfect plan.

225
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,164
<i>We have the element of surprise
on our side,</i>

226
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,333
<i>so I say, aerial attack.</i>

227
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,835
<i>I'll rappel down
while he's totally distracted.</i>

228
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,921
[Ray] <i>Love it.
And then I'll rappel next to Nate.</i>

229
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,800
And then we'll high-five mid-air,
and it will be epic.

230
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,678
And then... Wait. Ray, are you crying?

231
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,389
It's just that I love this plan.

232
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,516
[Nate] No. Yeah, man, I get it.

233
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,309
I'm a little choked up.
It's a great plan.

234
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,896
<i>And then we'll land behind Henslowe
to his total surprise.</i>

235
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,942
<i>You'll subdue him,
and I'll grab the ring.</i>

236
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,318
Ha! Got it.

237
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:56,072
Then Behrad will air-blast Henslowe's
thugs with a killer gust of wind.

238
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,200
Dude, I don't dance like that.

239
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,703
And then Constantine will emerge
from the shadows, per uje.

240
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,122
[yelling gibberish]

241
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,584
Spout some nonsense, and cast a spell
on any troublemakers

242
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,294
<i>to make them think that they're animals.</i>

243
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,547
[animal vocalizations]

244
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,757
<i>[Nate] And then we go to Star City.</i>

245
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,509
We pick up Wild Dog and we--

246
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,303
Oi. Story time's over. I got it.

247
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,014
How the hell did you do that?

248
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,350
What, I just nicked it off his hand
while you lot were prattling on.

249
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,935
Does that mean the mission is over?

250
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,980
Which is why we should get moving,
find that next Loom piece, yeah?

251
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,524
And it's time for you to go, Haircut.

252
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,276
Ray, where are you going?

253
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,029
On.., on my honeymoon.

254
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,992
Nora and I are going
to Bermuda... Bahamas.

255
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,203
Shut up! You're doing
the whole "Kokomo" package?

256
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,538
Bro, you're gonna be gone for weeks.

257
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,540
I didn't even throw you
a proper bachelor party.

258
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,293
The mission isn't officially over

259
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,836
until we bring the ring back
to the ship, right?

260
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,046
Which is where
we should be going right now.

261
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,799
- Come on, let's go.
- Ray! You're not going anywhere.

262
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,843
Grab your doublet and your ruff,

263
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:03,222
because this bachelor party
is gonna be an Elizabethan extravaganza!

264
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,725
You know, the other thing
about book club is,

265
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,311
it can help you figure out what
your true path is supposed to be.

266
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,604
Oh, so this is a cult.

267
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,813
-[coughs]
-[Agent Sharpe] No, no, no.

268
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,858
We don't... We don't use certain
"C" words. "Cult," "clone."

269
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,694
I would know,
because book club helped me

270
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,946
move forward after my time
in a real cult.

271
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,573
Look, I get your reservations.

272
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:24,118
The last "club" I joined programmed me
to be an assassin.

273
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,454
But book club,
it's helping me be a real person.

274
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,456
And I'd killed a federal agent.

275
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:34,003
I meant to lead with, I'm a Kaupe.
It's like a Hawaiian Werewolf.

276
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,838
Book club helped me cope with that.

277
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,466
That's also a lot to... Okay.

278
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,385
So what do you think, Zari?
Can book club help you?

279
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,682
You know what? Enough about me.

280
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,684
This is Nora's last book club.

281
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,730
Shouldn't we be throwing her
a belated bachelorette bash?

282
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,648
[all gasp]

283
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,692
-[all] Yes!
- That's what I'm saying, right?

284
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,778
[Gideon] Captain, I have
an incoming transmission.

285
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,321
-[shushing] The boys.
- Let's get a fireman.

286
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,447
- Shh!
- What?

287
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,325
<i>[Nate] Hey, Sara. Sorry that the mission
is taking so long.</i>

288
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:08,120
It's just that a dog took the ring,
and it turned out to be the, um...

289
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,958
You know, the Queen's dog.
But we got it covered. We're good.

290
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,878
Well, great then.
Uh, keep us posted, and be safe.

291
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,004
Copy that.

292
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,132
Fill them up! She bought it.

293
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,425
[all cheering]

294
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,220
All right, the boys
are gonna be a while.

295
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,098
So pop that champagne and fill her up!

296
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,683
[all cheering]

297
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,938
I noticed John Constantine
is walking topside.

298
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,941
Plans changed. I needed leverage.

299
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,151
John is working for me now.

300
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,778
He promised me something.

301
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:45,116
What exactly is John Constantine
doing for you, Astra?

302
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,953
He said something
about some powerful artifact,

303
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,831
whatever it is,
that can bring my mom back.

304
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,169
I'd have a family again.

305
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,381
So...

306
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,678
John makes this grand promise
to bring your family back,

307
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,138
and you quickly forget...

308
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:11,475
that I'm the one who found you
roaming the streets as a child.

309
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,602
I'm the one who pulled you
from the gutter.

310
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,564
- I raised you--
- No! No, I haven't forgotten.

311
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,484
Then did it occur to you,
if John brings your mother back,

312

I will no longer be in your life.

00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,864
You know I don't want that.

314

You are my family.

315
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,912
If there's a way
to discover what he's after,

316
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,706
maybe you could get it for yourself.

317
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,918
I know a way we can find out.

318
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,841
This is an exspiravit ritual.

319
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,178
It will allow you to see the other side.

320
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,974
You'll be among those on Earth,
able to spy on John like a ghost.

You sure you're ready?

Fill it up.

323
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,753
Go on, Ray. Say a few words.

324
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,839
- Speech! Speech!
- Speech! Speech!

325
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,969
Um, I just wanna say.., thank you
for this bachelor party.

326
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,722
You're the best friend a guy could have.

327
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:36,060
- No, no. Because you are!
- You are!

328
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:40,356
Is there anything else
you'd like to say, Ray?

329
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,982
Mmm-mmm.

330
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:46,112
Anyone have any big life changes
that they wanna reveal?

331
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,116
I got a kid.

You what?

333
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,577
I've been trying to ignore her, but I...

334
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,080
can't stop thinking about her.

335
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,624
Aw, it's a good thing, Mick.

336
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,376
It's called love.

All right, Ray. What's up?

Why haven't you told Nate
that you're leaving?

Because he's my best friend.

And the moment I tell him, then...

444

this all becomes real.

445

And I know it's my choice, my decision,

446

but I don't... I don't know
if I'm really ready for it.

You remember when we first
moved on the ship?

448
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:41,467
We left our entire lives behind us.
We had no idea what to expect.

449
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,053
But because we embraced the change...

450
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,014
We made history.

451
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,308
Sure did.

that we would still be here...

453
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,609
and that we'd be saying goodbye already?

454

COPY-

473
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,462
[actor] Take to the skies, brethren.

474
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,172
I can't believe
we have to destroy these.

475
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:03,882
This show has potential.

476
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,971
[clears throat] Hear ye! Hear ye!

477
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,139
So there's been a change of plans.

478
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,684
You guys have been replaced
by <i>Riverdale.</i>

479
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,731
- William Shakespeare?
- Bother me not.

480
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,984
I'm making amendments to my script.

481
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,277
I must elucidate more clearly

482
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,862
what the Steel Man's
takeaway lesson is from the story.

483
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,490
I'm actually here to speak to you
about your new play.

484
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:29,950
I know you.

485
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,411
You're one of the constables
that asked for the ring,

486
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,788
and who caused such a glorious row
with Henslowe and his men.

487
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,082
Yes, and now I'm here

488
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,584
to say that

489
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,335
you cannot put on the show.

490
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,380
But I finally struck inspiration.

491
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,841
Look, I have a plan.

492
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:48,844
Romeo and Juliet

493
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,345
will form a team,

494
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,347
and I will henceforth
introduce the allies,

495
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,808
Hamlet, Viola, and Puck,

496
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,603
who will join forces
to face Richard Ill.

497
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,646
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

498
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,774
Now I understand why you've written
this new version of the play.

499
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,526
You don't want
Romeo and Juliet's story to end.

500
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,527
Exactly.

501
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,655
I love the characters,
so why say goodbye?

502
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,491
But if you truly love the characters,

503
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,493
don't they deserve a great ending?

504
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,209
I've always known
how to finish their story.

505
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,128
If I let them go,

506
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,839
I'm unsure what happens next.

507
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,010
I understand, but...

508
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,638
endings are necessary for growth.

509
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:37,351
No matter how painful they may be.

510
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,687
You speak quite wisely.

511
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,857
I'm speaking from experience.

512
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,985
I find myself in a similar situation.

513
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:52,824
When I'm done here, I am leaving my team
for a new adventure,

514
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,245
and ending our journey
has proven more heartbreaking...

515
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,456
than I can bear.

516
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,709
And while
I can't imagine saying goodbye,

517
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,670
I know that I must.

518
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,797
Very well.

519
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,259
I shall do what is needed
for my beloved characters,

520
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:15,097
give Romeo and Juliet an ending
no one will forget.

521
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,646
All righty.

522
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,231
If we did our job right,

523
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,149
this cover should change back

524
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,236
<i>to Romeo and Juliet any second.</i>

525
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,946
I know you're leaving, Ray.

526
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,616
Yeah, uh, to my honeymoon.

527
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,368
Would you just knock it off?

528
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,162
I know you're leaving the team.

529
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,626
Nate, I'm... I'm sorry.

530
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,461
I was gonna tell you sooner.

531
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,506
I swear, but I just...
I didn't know how to do it.

532
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,341
Maybe if you had the balls
to say it sooner,

533
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:54,761
maybe I could have done something
like make us a last-mission playlist

534
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,763
or get us matching T-shirts.

535
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,057
That would have been amazing.

536
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,560
But I was waiting
for some perfect moment,

537
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,145
which doesn't exist,

538
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,106
because I didn't want to upset you.

539
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,983
Of course, I'm upset!

540
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,651
Today could have been awesome.
It could have been amazing,

541
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,403
but now it's just...

542
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,197
It's just over.

543
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:18,827
Eventually, everything has to change.

544
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,287
Yeah, I know everything
changes eventually.

545
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,496
I didn't think it'd be so soon,

546
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,248
and I didn't think
I'd be the last one to know.

547
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,541
[Gideon] Attention, Legends.

548
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,918
There is no record of the play
Romeo and Juliet

549
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,171
in the timeline, which means--

550
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,089
Shakespeare didn't put on the play yet.

551
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,425
The final mission isn't completed.

552
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,718
We can still go back

553
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,344
and fix history together.

554
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,808
The team has it, Ray. You should go.

555
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,351
You're right.

556
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,229
Things change eventually,
so why not start now?

557
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,023
Nate.

558
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,567
Nate!

559
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,533
[Nate] Willy Shakes,

560
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,826
what's happening?

561
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,329
Spare me your whimsical turns of phrase.

562
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,246
Barkeep,

563
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,749
my draught has gone hollow.
I'll have another.

564
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,710
Will, what happened to the play?

565
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,047
Henslowe withdrew the moneys
and shut us down.

566
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,508
In his mind's eye,
he thinks I stole back his ring.

567
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,676
Now, I have no theater,

568
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,805
no actors, and so no career.

569
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,224
Tell us where Henslowe is.
We'll help you.

570
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,892
Just leave me be.

571
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,353
I've seen your help in action,
and it is anything but.

572
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,646
So you're just gonna give up?

573
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,356
It's like the tall one said.

574
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,441
All things must cease.

575
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,820
And this is the end
of William Shakespeare.

576
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,782
- He is so dramatic.
- Yeah.

577
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,167
Woah.

578
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,754
- Packed already?
- Yeah.

579
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,756
Figured why wait.

580
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,383
Well, there's no rush.
You know, we can stick around

581
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,009
until they get back.

582
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,263
I think we've stuck around
too long already.

583
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,696
What is going on?

584
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,781
Well, we ruined
the Western literary canon,

585
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,116
and Shakespeare hates us,

586
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,493
so here's to Legends of Tomorrow,

587
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:27,455
who single-handedly destroyed
storytelling as we know it.

588
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,791
Sorry, so that's it?

589
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,461
First, you pick a fight with Ray,
and now you admit defeat!

590
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,006
Are you just trying to prove
that everything is as miserable

591
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,049
-as how you feel?
- I don't wanna talk about Ray.

592
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,052
Look, Nate, I get it.

593
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,013
I'm afraid of losing Ray, too.

594
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,348
Honestly, I don't know
what we're gonna do

595
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,768
without his stupid optimism
and blind faith

596
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:52,188
and ridiculous plans
that somehow always work.

597
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,233
I know what we need to do.

598
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,072
Gideon, tell the team it's
all hands on deck here at the tavern,

599
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,575
and fabricate some codpieces.

600
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,161
The show must go on.

601
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,502
All right, it's almost showtime.

602
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,838
Remember, Gideon is going to be
feeding you your lines.

603
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,048
Yeah, no pressure.

604
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,675
It's not like we're rebooting
Shakespeare's career or anything.

605
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,677
It really is book club's
greatest mission yet.

I can't believe I let you guys
rope me into this one.

you gotta do things our way.

You think this is gonna work, Captain?

609
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,228
Honestly, no. But Ray would.

Give me my long sword, ho!

635
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:42,132
A sword? A crutch!

636
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:45,176
Why call you for a sword?

00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,220
My sword, I say!

Thou shalt not stir one foot

Do not swear.

648

Although I take joy in thee,

649
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,557
I take no joy in this contract tonight.

650
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,808
It is too rash,

651
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,478
too unadvised, too sudden.

652
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,064
Too rash,

653
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,400
[voice wavers] too unadvised,
too sudden.

654

Too like the lightning,

00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,160
which doth cease to be.

656
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,288
One can say, it lightens.

What's wrong?

663
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,845
I mean, other than the fact this role
clearly should have gone to a woman.

664
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,681
I just need a second, okay?

665
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,974
Acting is hard.

666
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,727
I know it can be hard to face

667
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:20,063
that your time with someone
is coming to an end.

668
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,774
Sometimes, it's easier to just

669
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:27,028
send them away before it hits you.
Like Juliet's doing here.

670
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,655
She got all that?

671
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,490
She was meant for book club.

672
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,742
Change is hard,

673
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,912
but it can also be beautiful.
It can be both.

674
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:41,042
You know, it's not too late
to say goodbye to your friend.

675

- What about Juliet?
- I have it handled.

Gidget, I'm off-book.

This bud of love,
by summer's ripening breath,

may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

Is that a man?

- Good night.
- Does it matter?

683

Good night.

All right, Gideon.

It's time for me to go.

Will I ever see you again?

I hope so.

What satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?

702
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,856
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vows for mine.

703
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,525
I gave thee mine
before thou didst request it,

704
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,152
and yet I would it were to give again.

705
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,821
Wouldst thou withdraw it?
For what purpose, love?

706
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,867
But to be frank, and give it thee again.

It was just a lot to process,
and I didn't know how to say it.

00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,056
The thing is, I'm just really sad...

I'm sorry that you found out
the way you did...

some way that everything

You Okay?

It's a weird thing with friendship.

740
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,282
It starts because you need each other.

741
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,077
And then, if you do it right

742
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,954
and help each other grow,

743
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,206
you need each other less.

744
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,417
I guess change is the whole point.

745

On a Shakespeare kick?

This guy is a hero.

758
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,539
You know King Lear is a tragic figure

759
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,624
whose stubbornness
and fear of the future

760
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,293
leads to his own misery?

761
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,336
Sounds like someone I can get behind.

762
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,005
You should talk to your daughter.

763
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,008
There's no secrets in book club.

764
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,637
I'm not hiding from her.

765
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,223
- I'm protecting her.
- From what?

766
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,815
Nurturing fathers
don't run in my family.

767
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,402
But I'm better off
because I had you in my life.

768
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,362
She will be, too.

Gonna take that as a yes.

774
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,216
So this is part of the Loom of Fate?

775
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,177
Well, I had to disguise the bit
so that mere mortals like you

776
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,929
wouldn't burst into flames
when you looked at it.

777
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,890
That is certainly
very thoughtful of you, Charlie.

778
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,768
Not so fast.

779
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,604
This is too powerful, John,
and, honestly,

780
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,772
you're too close to it.

781
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,649
You know, this is my mission, Sara.

782
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,692
And this is my ship.

783
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,362
- So what's the plan?
- This is just the beginning.

784
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,698
But with that,
we can find the other pieces.

785
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,376
[sighs] I was so worried.

786
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,586
I wasn't sure when you'd wake up.

787
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,296
What did you see?

788
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:46,175
I...I was in a bar...

789
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,094
and people were...

790
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,389
laughing, and...

791
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,766
And John was there with his friends.

792
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,393
Did he say what he was looking for?

793
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,731
He's looking for the Loom of Fate.

794
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,360
The Loom?

795
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,196
- So you've heard of it?
- Of course.

796
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:12,118
The Loom of Fate is one
of the most powerful tools in existence.

797
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,954
It could completely rewrite your life.

798
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,584
Are you sure you want to trust
that power in someone else's hands?

799
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,379
Especially John Constantine's?

800
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:29,885
[sighs]

801
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,308
- Can't sleep either, huh?
- Yeah.

802
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:39,145
You know,
we all spend time off the ship,

803
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,647
but people usually don't feel this,
uh...

804
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,357
<i>Gone.
-. , gone.</i>

805
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,152
How early does a guy have to get up
to get some alone time?

806
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:50,364
Ray's green juice.
You feeling sentimental too, huh, Mick?

807
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,200
The juice was taking up
all the room in the fridge.

808
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,493
Now shut up, pretty.

809
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:58,039
Missing someone after they're gone
almost makes them more present.

810
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,832
Heard you get up, babe.

811
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,627
- I was awake anyway.
- Hi, babe.

812
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,004
I had a feeling other people
would be up.

813
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,048
Oh, gross! Is that Ray's green juice?

814
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,674
- Yep.
-[Charlie] Give me some.

815
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:15,765
[sighs]

816
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,437
To Ray...

817
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,315
who taught me how to be a better friend

818
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,567
by being a better friend
than I deserved.

819
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,654
Who told me that, if you're dumb enough
to expect good from the world,

820
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,906
well, it might just live up
to your expectations.

821
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:36,077
And who showed us
that there's never a problem so big

822
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,245
it can't be solved with a smile.

823
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,498
To the big guy.

824
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,415
- To Ray.
- To Ray.

825
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,375
To Ray.

826
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,669
I'm really gonna miss him.

827
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:46,003
[gags]

828
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,130
Tastes like death.

829
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,298
It's delicious.

830
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,137
You think Ray left
that bathroom sign-up sheet?

831
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,643
No, no, no!

832
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,773
