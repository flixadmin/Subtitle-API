we're delivering 40 kilos.

We didn't hear a call for ESU go out.

You guys
aren't supposed to be here, either.

he wanted to do things differently.

{\an8}Oh, no. Look, it's fine, he

26
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:31,007
{\an8}still thinks
we spent the weekend at a spa.

27
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:35,011
{\an8}But why can't we tell him about Sara?

00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,763
{\an8}Sara, she needs more time.

{\an8}And I don't need Oliver's judgment.

{\an8}Just a couple more days,
and she'll be back to herself.

{\an8}I promise.

32
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,689
{\an8}Guessing he didn't tell you
what we're doing here, either.

33
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,526
{\an8}No. He just had a perma-grin on his face
the whole way here.

34
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,194
{\an8}Okay, now I'm worried.

35
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,945
{\an8}He said he has some big announcement
to make.

{\an8}Uh...

{\an8}What is it that you wanted to tell us?

{\an8}And why are you telling us here?

-Yes.

that this

who isn't hiding behind a mask.

but you're not a politician.

for me to be elected.

{\an8}What are you going to do for a staff,
or campaign manager, money?

00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,343
{\an8}The money part's taken care of.

58
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,762
{\an8}Palmer Tech has funded enough
to kick-start the campaign.

59
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,181
{\an8}The decision I'm sure
my Board of Directors

{\an8}But you can't say that you're gonna run

isn't enough.

be a little bit more supportive.

we're not supportive, Oliver.

it was just me.

through a processing algorithm, 24/7.

This way, if anything happens in the city,
we will know about it.

Two police detectives found shot to death
responding to a code three.

99

Um, there's no record of them
calling dispatch for backup.

100
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,561
Which means either their comms failed,
or they were ambushed

Right. I'll talk to Lance.

00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,611
Maybe skip the part
about running for mayor

you're not gonna have his vote.

without the help of the S.C.P.D.

-Okay.
-Hmm.

No idea.

to get a full work-up.

116

What? How is evidence from a crime scene
where two detectives were killed

00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,931
not a top priority?

are they gonna be a weekly thing?

-What's that?
-I wouldn't know.

I might be able to help with eventually.

I'm trying to catch a cop killer

you're gonna draw attention. All right.

-The woman tried to escape.

307
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,789
(SIGHS) We chased her,
but she went through a mine field.

-That one got Richards.

Made it memorable.

312
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,429
-What? I'm supposed to kill her, right?
-Her, yeah. Richards, not so much.

313
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,015
-I didn't kill Richards. I told you...
-Yeah, landmine. I know.

00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,144
You know what's funny?

315

We've been here months without a problem.

316

And here you come, and two guys
get wasted by landmines.

What's that supposed to mean?

318
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,987
It means I want to see her.

319
00:15:46,903 --> 00:15:49,573
The woman. I want to see the body.

320

Okay.

but something about the drugs, the club...

there's corruption on the force.

Those ESU
had some pretty fancy toys tonight,

357

that definitely weren't
standard police issue.

358
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:39,243
Well, they were police issue, all right.
But just not standard.

359
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:43,038
Those were specialized anti-vigilante
task force gear.

I thought the task force was disbanded.

Yeah. I might've reinstated that, uh,
last year.

-Forty or so.

Well, that definitely narrows things down
a bit.

We should check their conduct records.

a little bit more.

we'd sniff them out otherwise.

to pack the special gear.

-There's no way he didn't peg us as cops.

-We got to take him out.
-We don't kill cops.

Tell that to the two gold shields
we wasted last night.

They were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

380
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,971
I'm not killing fellow officers
in cold blood.

381
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,682
Our advantage was
the force thought we were gangbangers.

382
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:45,601
We should put this to a vote.

383
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:50,397
My vote's nine-millimeters
and the only one that counts.

384
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,524
We are not criminals.

385
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,151
Let's all just try to remember that.

386
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,946
We went this route
because this city is dying,

387
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:00,616
and we need to be able to provide
for our families.

388
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,411
It still doesn't change the fact
that Lance is a problem.

389
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:07,289
No. He's not.

390
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,209
He's a solution.

00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,127
Curtis.

392
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,045
There you are.
Why haven't you been answering my texts?

393
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,883
Your texts were "9-1-1 OMG ASAP"
and five exclamation points.

394
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,427
I do not have time to respond to something
that doesn't contain

395
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,221
at least one actual word.

396
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,473
I need your help
with Mr. Palmer's crash log.

397
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,807
I thought I told you to let that go.

398
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,769
Look, I've tried brute-forcing
the password, but nothing works.

399
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,104
But there is a sub-kernel
that contains a programmer note.

400
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:32,731
Oh, my God, this must be
what talking to me is like.

401
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:36,443
And that programing note suggests that
you know the password.

402
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,154
I mean, which makes sense, right,
you and Mr. Palmer were friends.

403
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,325
-Yeah. I know the password.
-You do?

404
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,035
-So tell it to me so we can just...
-No, I...

405
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,416
I do not want to listen to a recording

406
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,168
of my ex-boyfriend's
final moment before he died.

407
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,881
You and Mr. Palmer were together?

408
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,010
Now, do you understand why
I don't want to hear his voice?

409
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,597
No.

410
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,603
My brother died six years ago.

411
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,274
Pancreatic cancer.

412
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,947
To be able to hear something from him
I'd never heard before?

413
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,452
God, I'd give anything.

414
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,423
Captain Lance. What a pleasure it was
to receive your message.

415
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,550
And for you to initiate contact, well,

416
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,386
it made me feel like our relationship
took an important step forward.

417
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,055
-I need your help.
-I'm sorry. Say that again?

418
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:48,390
It's for my daughter.

419
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,100
And not the one
that you're holding over me as leverage.

420
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,977
Sara, the one you lost last year.

421
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,895
Yeah, she's back.

422
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,897
This thing called the Lazarus Pit.

423
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,566
Sure you've heard of it.

424
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:59,360
What, you did your homework on me,

425
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,111
you don't think I did a little
digging around on you?

426
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,155
You used to be a member
of The League of Assassins.

427
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,032
What is it you want, Mr. Lance?

428
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,034
She's my daughter.

429
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,954
She's not right.
She's come back, and she's different.

430
00:22:11,037 --> 00:22:12,914
-She's crazy.
-It's a miracle she came back at all.

431
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,711
It doesn't feel like a miracle, all right?

432
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,755
Now, you know about this stuff.
Is there anything I can do?

433
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,882
-Is there anything that you can do?
-I can give advice.

434
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,717
Father to father.

435
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:27,554
I can tell you that
if it were my daughter, I'd put her down.

436
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,769
-She's my baby girl.
-No, she isn't.

437
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,187
She may look like your daughter,
but she doesn't possess her soul.

438
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,568
The most loving act you can commit

439
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,945
is to return Sara to her final rest.

440
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,866
I'm sorry.

441

Oh!

443

Oh, I'm so glad we came back.

444
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:11,097
-You all right?
-Hmm?

445
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,307
You're doing that, um...

446
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,935
Crinkly thing, with your eyebrows.

447
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,896
Just... (CHUCKLES)
No, just something at work.

448
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,774
It's no big deal. Um, this work, big deal.

449
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,109
OLIVER: Liza Warner.

450
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,904
I pulled her S.C.P.D. personnel file
using my computer at Palmer Tech

451
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,155
since ours is fritzing.

452
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:30,200
One of the original recruits
to the anti-vigilante task force

453
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:33,203
-over three years ago.
-Hand-picked by then-Detective Lance.

454
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,581
Do you think she's a suspect?

455
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,167
I think that Sergeant Warner has deposited
over a quarter of a million dollars

456
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,919
into offshore bank accounts
for the last three months.

457
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,421
-Where can we find her?
-I am working on that.

-No. Someone.

The man that Lance is talking to...

I didn't know if you knew who he was,

By the time I figured out who he was,
what he was...

-That's when he threatened Laurel.
-Laurel can take care of herself.

what kind of man I really am.

You kill that man, you are.

616
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,004
I told you I wasn't a criminal.
But I also told you I was desperate.

617
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,673
(SCOFFS)

618
00:34:10,756 --> 00:34:11,966
We all are.

619
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,052
Living in this city,

620
00:34:14,885 --> 00:34:17,513
dealing with what we're dealing with
right now, we're all desperate.

621
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,849
We've all been made to do
desperate things.

622
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,561
Terrible things.

623
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:29,275
But I've got to believe
that we are not beyond redemption.

624
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,654
I got to believe that
this city can still be saved.

625
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,449
'Cause once we stop believing,

626
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:41,579
that's when this city really dies
and us, us right along with it.

627
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,456
But, maybe...

628
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,585
Just maybe, we start saving our home

629
00:34:49,044 --> 00:34:51,046
by saving ourselves first.

630
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,761
And that means facing up to our mistakes.
That means facing justice.

631
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:04,102
You put on that uniform
'cause you believe in justice.

632
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,770
Ask yourself, Warner.

633
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,274
Is that still the case?

634
00:35:12,943 --> 00:35:14,112
(GRUNTS)

635
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,115
Do what you got to do.

636
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,120
I guess you know your Miranda rights.

637
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,297

(SIGHS)

639
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,842
-You got your own key or something?
-What you said to Warner saved my life.

640
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,431
I didn't know you had such a way
with words.

641
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,057
Well, I don't do encores.

642
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,810
You believe what you said?

643
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,813
Yeah. (SNIFFS) Every word.

644
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,774
Especially the part about facing justice.

645
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:57,280
When One Police Plaza opens this morning,
I will be there, turning myself in.

646
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,990
Can't have you do that.

647
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,827
We haven't been able
to get close to Darhk.

648
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,995
You have.

649
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,832
I'd like you to stick around.

650
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,000
Stay on the inside.

651
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,503
Well...

652
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,632
Well, that's only a smart plan
if you can trust me.

653
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,884
I trust the man who said
we can't stop believing

654
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,470
we can save this city.

655
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:53,043
-Like I said, stone cold killer.
-You satisfied?

656
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,046
Get rid of the body.

657
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,549
This cave might be useful for something.

-It's okay. You're okay.
-(PANTING)

660
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:17,360
How did you...

661
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:19,904
Where did you learn to do that?

662
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,406
I learned it here.

663
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,492
I haven't always been alone
on this island.

664
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,810
Son of a bitch.

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

OLIVER: Hi.

669
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,405
How you doing, man?

670
00:38:03,113 --> 00:38:04,532
Oliver Queen. Oh!

671
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,616
Hi, there.

672
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:10,288
It's, uh, absolutely wonderful
that, that all of you are here.

673
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,749
Just, just wonderful, and surprising.

674
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,586
(CHUCKLES) So? What do you think?

675
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:21,048
Um, hey, did you, did you hire
all of these people?

676
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:23,426
No. That's what makes them interns, Ollie.

677
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,177
Where did we get all of these interns?

678
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,013
Easiest way to get a lot of followers
on social media

679
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,475
is to own a very successful club.

680
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:34,562
All I had to do was tell them
what I've already known for three years.

681
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,065
Oliver Queen is gonna save the city.

682
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,652
-What's this?
-This is your speech.

683
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,572
You're announcing your candidacy
this afternoon.

684
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,325
So you better get your suit out
of mothballs.

685
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,661
Did you write this?

686
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,456
I wrote it down.

687
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,083
I just went with what you told me.

688
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:59,044
About this city being united.

although in my defense,</i>

696
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,194
<i>I did go to four of them.</i>

697

<i>I certainly don't have
a traditional background for leadership,</i>

to the shining beacon we know it can be.</i>

isn't a mystery.</i>
