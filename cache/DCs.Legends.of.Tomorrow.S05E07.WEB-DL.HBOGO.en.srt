1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,400
<i>Not even the six can stop me, now!</i>

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,880
Beebo want cuddles.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,160
Guys? Guys!

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,720
- Dad.
- I'm sorry, Nora.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,280
He died a good man.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,160
He died a demon, Ray.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,400
<i>Oh, I've been cleaning up some Beebo</i>

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,760
<i>Just to scrub the time anomalies away</i>

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,320
<i>Hey, can't you see
The blue fluff blowing</i>

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,400
Hello?

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,280
Who's there?

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,760
I'm just gonna use my hand
to block out the sun's glare

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,960
so I can see you...

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,240
You.

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,360
No!

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,960
No! It can't be you!

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,400
The Loom of Fate.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,840
An ancient artifact
that has the power

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,040
{\an5}to change any person's life story
without wrecking the timeline.

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,480
Anyone's, like...

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,880
Astra's.

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,120
And we give her a life
where her mum never died

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,280
and where she never goes to Hell.

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,000
{\an5}If you think I'm helping you,
you're daft as a brush.

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,120
I destroyed that thing
for a bloody good reason, John-o.

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,400
Come on, Sara.

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,040
You know this can solve
all of our problems.

28
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,560
It can erase all of the Encores.

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,840
Yeah, and make
all of our dreams come true.

30
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,520
John, I'm sorry,
but I'm with Charlie on this one.

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,840
That kind of cosmic power

32
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,600
doesn't belong
in the hands of anyone.

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,280
Astra has made her choices, John.

34
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,200
It's not up to you to undo them.

35
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,360
Now, this...

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,760
{\an5}will be the solution
to our Encore problem.

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,840
<i>Captain Lance,
there is a new Encore detected</i>

38
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,880
<i>in Salvation, 1874.</i>

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,080
I love my Prognosticator.

40
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,760
All right, Legends!

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,520
{\an5}Grab your cowboy hats
and leather straps

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,120
because we are going to...

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Where is everyone?

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,960
I, might have got
a bit sentimental on my deathbed

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,880
{\an5}and encouraged Raymond
to carpe his diem.

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,280
Nice rock.

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,920
She'll love that.

48
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,560
And when she finds it...

49
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
I'll pop the question.

50
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,520
She's here. She's really here.

51
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Oh, man.

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,360
It's really happening.

53
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,560
Our work here is done.

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,440
Our boy is all grown up.

55
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,920
Nora Darhk, welcome.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,240
I will have the pleasure
of serving you this evening.

57
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,280
Thanks, Gare.

58
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
Wow, Ray.

59
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,320
{\an5}You really went all out
for date night.

60
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,480
I thought we were just having pizza.

61
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,600
Oh. I got a little inspired, I guess.

62
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,320
Yeah. Yeah, well...

63
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,760
I see Pippa is still your charge.

64
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,680
{\an5}Yes, until we figure out
her heart's deepest need.

65
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
Big talker, I see.

66
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,840
Defiling the library, I see.

67
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,200
{\an5}Yeah, well, you know,
I've quit smoking.

68
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,920
So, I need a new habit.

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,280
- Doing some research?
- Yeah. Yeah.

70
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,880
{\an5}I need to find the Loom of Fate
to save Astra.

71
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,880
{\an5}But since, Charlie
isn't making it easy for me,

72
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,800
I am doing it the hard way.

73
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,680
Why not ask an historian?

74
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,360
All right then, Mr. Professor,
tell me, what do you know?

75
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,440
Well, when I was in grad school,

76
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,760
my professor showed me a diary

77
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,160
of an explorer named
Ernest Shackleton.

78
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,320
Now, Shackleton
was obsessed with the Loom

79
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,000
and he believed a piece of it
was buried under the South Pole.

80
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,200
{\an5}So, if I'm to find the Loom,
I've got to search the South Pole.

81
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,360
Shackleton thought so.

82
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Bloody hell.

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
Nice one, mate.

84
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
Don't worry, John.

85
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,480
We'll figure out another way
to help you and Astra.

86
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,720
That ought to cool his jets.

87
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,320
Hey, Mick.

88
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,920
Saddle up.
We're going to the Wild West.

89
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,440
Is everything okay in there?

90
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,240
He's been in there for days.

91
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,440
What are you still doing here?

92
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
Exfoliating.

93
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,360
Mick, get out here right now!

94
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,120
- What?
- What is going on?

95
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,120
Someone's trashing
Rebecca Silver online.

96
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Oh, cute. You have a troll.

97
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,840
What's wrong with your face?

98
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,800
Zari, your mission is to help Mick.

99
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,760
Okay. I have so many makeover ideas.

100
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,200
With his troll problem.

101
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,960
Did I just fritz out of existence?

102
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,280
Help! A train coming! Help me!

103
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,280
Please! Help me. Untie me.

104
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,920
I'm too beautiful to die so young.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,200
Train's coming!

106
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,080
Oh, my God! Oh, God! The train!

107
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,320
Oh, God!
Director Sharpe, you saved me.

108
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Okay.

109
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,560
Wait, wait a second.

110
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,680
Did you just say "Director Sharpe"?

111
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah.

112
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,200
Gary, what year are you from?

113
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,920
The present. 2018.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,480
Okay, listen.
I need you to tell us who did this,

115
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,440
and then immediately
courier back to the Bureau.

116
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
I can't.

117
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,400
He stole my Time Courier.

118
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
Who?

119
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,600
Hi, Nora-doll.

120
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,800
Daddy's home.

121
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Dad.

122
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,600
Oh, Nora-doll, I missed you so much.

123
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,240
This is amazing.

124
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,360
How are you...

125
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,920
You are an Encore.

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
Look, all I know is,
I'm up here right now

127
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,480
as part of some
soul-harvesting pyramid scheme.

128
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,680
Honestly, I can't keep up
with these millennials

129
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,080
and all their newfangled
world-domination plans.

130
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,400
So, you're doing
the whole villain thing again.

131
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,800
Well, you, no, I mean...

132
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,560
Part of my parole agreement.

133
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,840
But after spending two years in Hell
worrying about my little girl,

134
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,800
I had to come and see you first.

135
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,040
But look at this place!

136
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,920
You must be a master sorceress
by now.

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,360
Oh, yeah, yeah.

138
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
This is just a place
where I hang my hat

139
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,640
and do my dark rituals.

140
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,760
"Dark rituals."

141
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,880
How did you find me? Blood magic?

142
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,640
Your Palmer Tech watch.

143
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,040
It still has location-sharing on.

144
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,680
Palmer Tech, right.

145
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,520
Ray!

146
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,680
Sorry for the delay.
Gary seems to have run off.

147
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
My dad's here.

148
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,240
- What?
- My dad's here!

149
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Your dad's here?

150
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,200
Oh, man. Is he an Encore?

151
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
Oh, man.

152
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,920
And Sara just found herself
a Hell Sword.

153
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
- Which means...
- She'll kill him.

154
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,760
- What do we do? What do we do?
- You have to leave.

155
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,520
- What about Pippa? Pippa! Pippa!
- Pippa. Pippa.

156
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,640
You have to take her.

157
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,920
You have to keep her comfortable,
so that she doesn't summon me.

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,280
That's it. That's gonna work.

159
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,360
- Thanks, Ray.
- Okay.

160
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,040
"Rebecca Silver knows
as much about love

161
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,280
as a teenage boy's sock drawer."

162
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,240
Okay. Bad reviews,
they just come with celebrity.

163
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,800
You should have heard
what they said about my perfume

164
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
when it made people
bleed out their noses.

165
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,360
He's gonna get more
than a bloody nose.

166
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,120
No. Don't stoop to his level.

167
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,560
Inside every troll is the heart of
a fan just dying for some attention.

168
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,800
And some swag.

169
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,200
One signed book, and he'll be
a Rebecca Silver stan forever.

170
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,560
Ta-da!

171
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
What's that?

172
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,440
Oh, this is a TV show
I used to watch when I was a kid.

173
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,240
It really helped me dig deep
and communicate my feelings better.

174
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,240
It's called
Mister Parker's Cul De Sac.

175
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,520
And I think
you're really gonna like it.

176
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
<i>Hi.</i>

177
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,600
<i>Welcome to my cul-de-sac, friend</i>

178
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,960
<i>That's a street that ends in a circle</i>

179
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,040
<i>The thing about circles
Is they never end</i>

180
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,080
<i>So our friendship will be universal</i>

181
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,040
This is very dumb.

182
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
<i>Hi, boys and girls.</i>

183
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,680
Well, just give it a chance, okay?

184
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,280
<i>Today, we're going to have
ourselves a wonderful...</i>

185
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,240
And how about 20 bucks?

186
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,160
I'll be right back.

187
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,800
<i>Could you ever imagine
what it'd be like to live underwater?</i>

188
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,200
So? Bachelor party?

189
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
No.

190
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,920
Nora's dad literally came back
from the dead

191
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,520
and ruined the evening.

192
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,920
Damien Darhk?

193
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,880
Anyway, Nora said she can handle it,
and so, she's handling it.

194
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,440
But we can't let anyone interfere.

195
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,560
Especially not Sara.

196
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,840
I mean,
he is your future father-in-law.

197
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,760
You don't think
we could talk Sara down?

198
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
When I see Damien Darhk,

199
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,440
I'm gonna kill him
for good this time.

200
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,600
What about Nora?

201
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,560
Well, ideally, she never finds out.

202
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,800
- Gideon, any hits?
<i>- Yes, Captain.</i>

203
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,840
<i>In fact,
I'm detecting new Encore activity</i>

204
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,800
<i>at Constantine's home in 2020.</i>

205
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,480
All right, let's do this discreetly.

206
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,960
Just us, no boys.

207
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,200
You know how sentimental
they can get.

208
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,000
- Yep.
<i>- You also received a call</i>

209
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,880
<i>from a Wild Dog while you were away.</i>

210
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,680
Yep, got it. Thanks, Gideon.

211
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,880
What was that all about?

212
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,040
Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.

213
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,160
This is extremely pornographic.

214
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,240
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

215
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,840
Troll made a post.

216
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,520
Must have gotten his swag back.

217
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,160
Oh, look,
he's showing off your signature.

218
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,520
This is perfect.

219
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
What the...

220
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,360
That little punk.

221
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,240
Okay. Change of tactic.

222
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
What are you doing?

223
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Scouring the metadata from his posts
to composite his location.

224
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,920
- You hack?
- No.

225
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,760
- It's a girl.
- It's okay. Just go.

226
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
Do you know who I am?

227
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,920
Yeah, what are you doing here, Becky?

228
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,280
<i>"I am Rebecca Silver, and you will
listen to me, you pimple-faced..."</i>

229
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,000
- But she doesn't have pimples.
- Just go. Keep going.

230
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,640
<i>"I'm a celebrated author.</i>

231
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,080
<i>My latest novel was a triumph
and you know it.</i>

232
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,840
<i>What... what the hell
have you done with your life</i>

233
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,440
<i>and who are you to judge others?"</i>

234
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
Mick?

235
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,920
Ali?

236
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,800
Mick, why... why are you here?

237
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
- Why are you here?
- I live here.

238
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,080
Why is she filming us?

239
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
This your kid?

240
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,120
Well, I guess, since you're here,
I might as well tell you.

241
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
She's your kid, too.

242
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,080
This is Lita, your daughter.

243
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
<i>Twist!</i>

244
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
<i>Oh, he's fine.</i>

245
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,040
Well, that was my wizard's tower.

246
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,440
I love it.

247
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,720
You can just smell
the dark forces at work in here.

248
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,480
- Safe neighborhood?
- Super safe.

249
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,120
People just mostly keep
to themselves.

250
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Good.

251
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,440
You know what the worst
kind of neighbors are?

252
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,240
- Kids.
- Hate kids.

253
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,080
You know, all I've ever asked for
are neighbors I don't have to kill.

254
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,320
But for people like us...

255
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,880
sometimes, it's kill or be killed.

256
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,880
You know what?

257
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,080
Better safe than sorry.

258
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
Right, Dad?

259
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
Atta girl.

260
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,720
- Did she see us?
- I don't know.

261
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,040
- What was that?
- You know what?

262
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,680
I have a surprise
for you in the study.

263
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,440
Well, I love surprises.

264
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Yes, I saw you!

265
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,800
Listen, I know you're here
to kill my dad.

266
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,520
And I know you have good reason.

267
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,000
But I'm asking you, as my friends...

268
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,880
just to give me this one night
to handle it my way.

269
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,360
And what exactly is your way?

270
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,120
This...

271
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Dad, may I present my...

272
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,040
henchmen.

273
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Women.

274
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,840
- People. Hench-people.
- Wait a minute.

275
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,400
Are you saying
the head of the Time Bureau

276
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,520
and the Captain of the Waverider
work for you now?

277
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,920
Well, I can be very convincing.

278
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,680
That is a heck of a find.

279
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,920
Eleventh century Mongolia,
if I'm not mistaken.

280
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,320
Oh, yeah!

281
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,960
That's just a little something
they picked up for me.

282
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,880
Thanks.
It's not for indoor use, though.

283
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,280
So, I'm just gonna...

284
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,280
Safety first, Nora-doll.

285
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,000
Thanks, you guys, for playing along.

286
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,160
Tick-tock, ladies.

287
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,280
I could really use that cocktail
about now.

288
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,600
Remind me again why
I shouldn't go in there right now

289
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,400
and stab him with Khan's sword.

290
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,520
He's my dad.

291
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,520
He's also one of the most powerful
dark warlocks on the planet, so...

292
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,720
Wait.

293
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,560
What if he was just a man?

294
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,920
- What?
- There's a potion

295
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
that can strip him of his powers.

296
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,080
It's complicated to make,

297
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,560
but there are ingredients here
in this house.

298
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,040
I know we can make it work.
We can put it in his dinner.

299
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,720
- I volunteer as tribute.
- Gary.

300
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,160
What the hell are you doing in there?

301
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,920
I was cowering, from the man
who almost killed me with the train.

302
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,360
Give me the recipe to your potion,
I will not fail you.

303
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
Bad idea.

304
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,600
- Do it for book club.
- What?

305
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,800
Are you seriously
invoking book club right now?

306
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Yeah.

307
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,560
You get one of those.

308
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,880
You get one. Are you sure?

309
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,040
Ava, I am invoking book club

310
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,200
to ask you to give me
one night with my dad.

311
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,480
And if he is a harmless,
normal man by the end of it...

312
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
you let him live.

313
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,160
Where are you going, Captain Cold?

314
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,160
Antarctica, of course.

315
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,480
That place is the worst.

316
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,320
But I'm following up
on the lead that you...

317
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,240
Bloody shape-shifters.

318
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,600
What?

319
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,600
Charlie. She used your face
to send me on some dead-end trail.

320
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,440
Send me to Antarctica.

321
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,560
Freeze my bloody arse off!

322
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,920
No! I'm getting off
this gormless jam jar.

323
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,600
Since there's no one here
that can help me, I'll do it my way.

324
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
Alone.

325
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,160
All right. I think I got
these stupid crostinis right.

326
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,360
How's the salad?

327
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,640
It just needs to be dressed,
and then there's the soup.

328
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,520
How many courses
did Ray have planned?

329
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,760
By my count, five.
Six if you include cocktails.

330
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,840
Come on, Ray.
Nobody gets laid after six courses.

331
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,160
Gary, how's the potion coming along?

332
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,880
Don't rush me.
Everything has to be done precisely

333
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,880
- or it will not work.
- Okay. Are you talking entree...

334
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,240
It'll be done by dessert.

335
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,000
Then let's get this dinner started.

336
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,200
Hello, you've reached
the office of Sara Lance.

337
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,720
How can I help you?

338
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,200
Well, hello, Mr. Dog.

339
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,480
What is this in reference to?

340
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,200
Cheers.

341
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,800
Oh, more crostinis!

342
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,920
These are delicious.

343
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,400
Bloody hell. Gary!

344
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,200
Damien Darhk.

345
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,480
John Constantine.

346
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,880
You know, I don't think
we've actually ever met before,

347
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,280
seeing as you're still breathing.

348
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,600
But you have died before,
though, right?

349
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,440
So, what's about to happen
should feel a little familiar.

350
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,880
<i>Remitte istud.</i>

351
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,560
That was an heirloom, you...

352
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,960
Stop it! Both of you.

353
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,440
This vagrant is trespassing.

354
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,680
This is my house, you plonker.

355
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,160
Your house? Nora, I thought...

356
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
Well...

357
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,040
technically, it is his house.

358
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,480
His name is on the title.

359
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,320
But, in practice...

360
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
it's our house.

361
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Right, babe?

362
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,600
Just go with it.

363
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Right, love.

364
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,960
My love, that is
because we are indeed together.

365
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,200
Oh, Nora-doll.

366
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,240
Here, I thought you were all alone.

367
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,000
But now, I know

368
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,240
that you have a powerful
warlock in your life.

369
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,800
Johnny C, you bring it in here.

370
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,360
You rascal!

371
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,680
<i>The thing about circles is
They never end</i>

372
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,360
<i>So our friendship will be universal</i>

373
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,920
Why does he keep changing his shoes?

374
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,920
Changing his shoes
is a soothing ritual

375
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,680
which takes him
from one space to another.

376
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,240
Where's my fairy godmother?

377
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,960
She's busy with her father.

378
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,760
So, why are you here and not there?

379
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,560
She asked me to give them space,
and I am respecting her boundaries.

380
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,760
She's hiding you from her dad.

381
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,680
Mr. Parker says you can love
whoever you want to love

382
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,280
and to not be ashamed.

383
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,880
Well, you don't have to quote
Season eight, Episode 15 to me.

384
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,280
Okay?

385
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,040
But look, she's not trying to hide...

386
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,080
Fairy godmother!

387
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,680
Fairy godmother!

388
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,760
Come here, right now!

389
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,440
Damn it, Ray! I said no summoning.

390
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Do you have any idea how many plates

391
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
I'm spinning right now,
trying to keep my dad happy?

392
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,160
Many. But quick question.

393
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,520
Are you hiding me?

394
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,240
Of course I am.

395
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,520
I am telling him
a thousand lies right now

396
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,800
to make sure nobody gets killed.

397
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,400
Oh, well,
why not just tell him the truth?

398
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,000
"Why not just tell him the truth?"
Okay.

399
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,040
Why don't I just tell
my megalomaniac dad

400
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,680
that his little girl is a slave
to the whims of children

401
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,560
and is schtupping an Eagle Scout?

402
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,320
That sounds amazing.

403
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,600
The longer you lie
about who you really are

404
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,280
the harder it's gonna be
when the truth finally comes out.

405
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,560
Listen, can you just give me
this one night?

406
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
Okay? Just help me out.

407
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,680
And save the guilt trip? Please.

408
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,000
- Okay?
- Of course.

409
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,240
- Okay? Good? Everything good?
- Of course.

410
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,520
Okay. Great.

411
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
<i>Good night, boys and girls.</i>

412
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,880
Do you need to change your shoes?

413
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
I think I do.

414
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,400
I named her Lita, after...

415
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,480
Yeah. Lita Ford of The Runaways.

416
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,720
Sorry I never told you.

417
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,880
Actually, I looked you up
after I found out I was pregnant

418
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,400
but you were in jail.

419
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Again.

420
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
So, it...

421
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,200
It must have been challenging,
raising a kid by yourself.

422
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,680
I made it work.

423
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,880
Sure, Lita would ask about her dad,
but whenever she did...

424
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,080
She would just say, you know,

425
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,520
"My standards were low
and his sperm count was high."

426
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,360
- Oh, God.
- But...

427
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,720
when I learned that Rebecca Silver
was actually him...

428
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,800
I guess I let it slip that we
had hooked up at our reunion.

429
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
Lita's a smart kid.

430
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
I guess she figured it out.

431
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,880
Yeah. My dad writes crappy novels.

432
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,800
- They're brilliant.
- Debatable.

433
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,760
Either way, I still hate you.

434
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,760
Lita, he... he didn't know.

435
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,920
But, I guess now that the pussycat's
out of the pouch...

436
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,080
guess you two can get
to know one another.

437
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,600
Sounds like fun.

438
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,360
No! What the hell are you doing?

439
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,560
We were never here.

440
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,640
True story, that.

441
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,720
I never knew that...

442
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,280
Wine!

443
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,640
Good to see you two getting along.

444
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,800
Oh, we're just telling stories,
aren't we?

445
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,240
You know, I shouldn't be shocked
that you'd be drawn

446
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,400
to a fellow after your pop's
old line of work.

447
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,960
Oh, well, you know me, Dad.

448
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,840
I can't help
but keep the family business going.

449
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
That's my girl.

450
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,480
Not that I could ever live up
to a great collector

451
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,320
of artifacts such as yourself.

452
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Oh, but sadly, some things
could never be found.

453
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,040
You take for instance,
the Loom of Fate.

454
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,800
I never did find that one.

455
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,040
That's because it was scattered
across the multi-verse.

456
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,320
Well, it's all on one Earth now.

457
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Ours.

458
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,320
Intriguing.

459
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,200
Still, you'd need a Fate to put it
all together and operate it.

460
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,280
Right. Sounds like there's no point
in even looking for it, right, John?

461
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,560
Yeah, especially with so many
exciting opportunities

462
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,120
to think about, right, babe?

463
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,120
Yep. Maybe not the time.

464
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,520
I'm sensing something juicy
bubbling with the help.

465
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,320
No, I don't...

466
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
Is there trouble in paradise?

467
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,840
You know what?
It's none of your damn business.

468
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,040
Oh, sit and spill.

469
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,840
Uncle Damien wants
to hear everything.

470
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,520
No, they don't have to...

471
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
You know what?

472
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,200
Someone forgot
to tell their girlfriend

473
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,080
about a job offer
they received to work in Star City.

474
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,800
- Babe.
- Permanently.

475
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,560
I was going to talk to you about it
before it became permanent.

476
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,360
- So, you're actually considering it?
- Yes.

477
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
I don't know... Okay, how is that
supposed to work with you there

478
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,360
and me, one of Nora's hench-people?

479
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,320
Sara, she's right.

480
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,840
You know, long-distance
relationships can be tough.

481
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,960
- Thank you.
- It wasn't going

482
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,440
to be a long-distance relationship.

483
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,600
I thought that we could go together.

484
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,480
This... this is why I always have

485
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,360
a no-fraternizing policy
with my staff.

486
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,280
Next course, please.

487
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,760
The potion is now purple,
and therefore...

488
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,120
ready to de-power the supervillain.

489
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,000
So, let me get this straight.

490
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,600
You stood up for yourself,
and she shut you down?

491
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,680
She just, doesn't think
that Damien would accept me.

492
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,160
But aren't you setting yourself up
for a lifetime of lies?

493
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,880
Will you have to lie
when Damien comes to visit?

494
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,440
Or when you guys have kids?

495
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,080
Because you know
those babies are going to have

496
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,800
that beautiful Palmer jawline.

497
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,640
The Palmer jawline
is a dominant gene.

498
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
Damn right.

499
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,280
- Am I rushing into this?
- Yes!

500
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,920
We couldn't say something
unless you said something. Ray...

501
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,960
It feels rushed.

502
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,480
She's embarrassed of you.

503
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,840
After you made the perfect dinner,
took a massage class

504
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,800
and hid an engagement ring
in the mousse?

505
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,160
The ring is in the mousse!

506
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,720
Well, I hope
you saved room for dessert.

507
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,520
Chocolate mousse.

508
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,120
Yeah, you should try it.

509
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,240
Don't eat the mousse.

510
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,120
- There's no chocolate in Hell.
- Perfection!

511
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,440
Mousse!

512
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,680
- What's that?
- Chocolate mousse.

513
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,400
This has always been your favorite,
right, Dad?

514
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,960
This just looks sinful.

515
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,200
Everybody, isn't this delicious?

516
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,640
Perfection!

517
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,280
A ring?

518
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,440
Well, that's unexpected.

519
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,840
I'm surmising that perhaps,

520
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,040
that cup was put in front
of the wrong person.

521
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,960
John, was there a question
that you wanted to ask?

522
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,040
"Question"?

523
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,720
Oh, right, yeah!

524
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,600
Question, of course.

525
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,560
Nora Darhk...

526
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,000
will you marry me?

527
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,480
Just when I thought this night
couldn't get any better,

528
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,520
my daughter has found
the love of her life.

529
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,720
Forget the mousse.

530
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,000
- More champagne!
- No.

531
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,400
What? What? I'm sorry, what was that?

532
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,960
- I thought you said no.
- No.

533
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,800
Okay, she said...

534
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,880
Did she say "no"?

535
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,400
No, I won't marry John...

536
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,800
because I can't lie
to you anymore, Dad.

537
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
Oh, thank God.

538
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,880
Johnny C, Johnny C,
Johnny C, don't, what are you doing?

539
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,720
Dad, Sara and Ava
aren't my henchwomen.

540
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,880
They're just my friends.

541
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,080
I'm not a powerful sorceress.

542
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,280
I'm a fairy godmother.

543
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,200
Dad, this isn't my house.

544
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,280
John isn't my boyfriend.

545
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
He is.

546
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,720
And I love him madly.

547
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,400
Hi, Damien, Mr. Darhk.

548
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,560
Since you're here, I was wondering
if I could get your blessing

549
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,680
to have your daughter's hand
in marriage?

550
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,000
You deceived me, Nora-doll.

551
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,240
Your own father.

552
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,720
You tried to poison me.

553
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,200
That's, that's not as bad
as it looks.

554
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,320
I've been gone
for less than two years, and you...

555
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,880
You're a completely different person.

556
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,600
And I know who's to blame.

557
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,400
No, no, no, no. Dad!

558
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,200
Stop! Stop!

559
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,520
<i>Inferni.</i>

560
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
<i>Brexit!</i>

561
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,680
- No!
- Let him go.

562
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,840
Stop, Dad!

563
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,160
Dad, I am not a child.

564
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,480
You can't just kill
my friends anymore!

565
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,160
Did you think you were gonna kill me
with that little toy, Lance?

566
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,600
Why don't you give me
a chance and find out?

567
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,240
That's no Mongolian relic.

568
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,160
That's a Hell Sword.

569
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,600
My, oh, my.

570
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,040
I am so going to enjoy
obliterating all of you.

571
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,040
<i>It's after 5:00
And I could use a cold one</i>

572
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,760
Is Mr. Parker getting tipsy?

573
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,080
The guy has done 4,000 hours
of children's television.

574
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,160
He's earned it.

575
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,440
Oi! How have you guys
not noticed the Encore alarm?

576
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,400
- It's at Constantine's house.
- Ray.

577
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,400
- Let's go.
- I wanna go.

578
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,560
No!

579
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,960
I wish it.

580
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,760
Now, that guy is marriage material.

581
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,080
Quit insulting Ray!

582
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,960
He made you poison your own father.

583
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,600
No, he didn't. That was my idea.

584
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,280
That's because he twisted you.

585
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,960
Look at you.
You're, you're a powerless fairy.

586
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,440
That's it! Pippa, make a wish.

587
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,320
Yes. You can stop this.

588
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,480
This is the only way you'll learn.

589
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,520
I wish you were all
on Mister Parker's Cul De Sac.

590
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,720
<i>Welcome to my cul-de-sac, friend</i>

591
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,000
<i>That's a street that ends in a circle</i>

592
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,280
<i>The thing about circles
Is they never end</i>

593
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,400
<i>So a friendship would be universal</i>

594
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,720
- Hello, boys and girls.
- Hi, Mr. Parker.

595
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,240
Hope you're having a wonderful day.

596
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
I sure am.

597
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,440
Come with me.

598
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
What the...

599
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,120
Boys and girls, please welcome
my friends Nora and Damien.

600
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,880
Now, why don't we discuss
our problems?

601
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,120
Damien, what seems to be
on your mind?

602
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,480
Well, you simpleton,
my child means everything to me

603
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,680
and you've completely
corrupted her into this!

604
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,400
See, this is why I had to lie.

605
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
I knew you couldn't handle it

606
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,600
because emotionally,
you're the child!

607
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,920
Well, I think this is gonna be
tougher than we thought, kids.

608
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,800
Why don't we travel
to the Land of Make 'Em Ups

609
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,000
with Gary,
the Unspeakable Train Abomination?

610
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,920
- Hi, Gary.
- Toot, toot, everybody, toot, toot!

611
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,800
Toot, toot, to you!

612
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,240
- Hello, John.
- Hello, Charlie.

613
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,560
- Hey, Ava.
- Yeah, Sara?

614
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,000
Are you bloody kidding me?
Puppets? Again?

615
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,600
I wanted to say that I feel bad
that I made you feel bad.

616
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,360
Oh, well, maybe we should
communicate.

617
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,800
I'm sorry I kept the job offer
in Puppet Star City a secret.

618
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,600
I was only considering it because I
thought you wanted to settle down.

619
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,160
Well, I used to want that.

620
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,560
But I've been having
a lot of fun on the ship.

621
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,520
Then I'll tell Puppet Wild Dog
to shove it!

622
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
- Yay!
- Yay!

623
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,800
Maybe you can work out
your problem with communication.

624
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,200
Yeah!

625
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,480
You were gonna send me
to the South Pole, Charlie.

626
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,320
You don't understand
how dangerous that Loom is, John-o.

627
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,840
It gave my sisters and me control
over everyone's lives.

628
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,920
I smashed that thing,
so we could be free.

629
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,240
People could be free to rebel,
free to be weird.

630
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,360
Oh, come on, Charlie.

631
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,640
If you sensed that the Loom was
in one universe again,

632
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,480
what's to say
your sisters didn't feel it, too?

633
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,680
What's to stop them going after it,
and for the wrong reasons?

634
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,160
Listen, I will use
the Loom to help Astra.

635
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,760
And then, I will help you destroy it,
forever this time.

636
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
Forever?

637
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,240
Deal?

638
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,680
Deal.

639
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,880
Yay for communication
and cooperation!

640
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,240
Yay.

641
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
<i>I wonder who that is?</i>

642
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,560
<i>It's Bike Messenger Behrad.</i>

643
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,640
<i>I hope you're having a wonderful day.</i>

644
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,880
<i>Let's see what was delivered.</i>

645
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,160
Open it! Open it!

646
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,000
It's the Safe Space Sombrero.

647
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,600
Please make it stop.
Make it just stop.

648
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,800
I am going to just...

649
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,520
Only the person wearing
the Safe Space Sombrero may speak.

650
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
You've ruined her life.

651
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,920
Her life is absolutely in shambles

652
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,320
because of you and the idiot brigade
she hangs out with.

653
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,800
I mean, look at her. She is trapped
in this horrible fairy godmother job.

654
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
Horrible job?

655
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,600
You know what, Dad?

656
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,800
My life now...

657
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,360
that's not Ray's choice, it's mine.

658
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,760
I know you think
all magic should be self-serving,

659
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,960
but I like helping kids

660
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,000
because being raised by a demon cult
instead of my own father?

661
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,920
That wasn't my choice.

662
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,200
That was yours.

663
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,080
So, maybe working with kids
helps me cope with that.

664
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
And you're right.

665
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,400
I am not the Nora-doll you remember.

666
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,960
I like who I am...

667
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,280
and I'm never going back.

668
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,000
I've been an ass.

669
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,720
I've had this vision of this life
that would make you happy.

670
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,040
Obviously, I was wrong.

671
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,720
I just want you to be proud of me.

672
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Proud?

673
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,080
Nora-doll...

674
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I am.

675
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Really?

676
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,080
I really am.

677
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,600
Oh, kids, look, the sun is smiling.

678
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:52,120
I thought my family was messed up,
but these guys are truly deranged.

679
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,760
I want to be with my own family now.

680
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,880
Fairy Godmother, I release you.

681
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
It worked!

682
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,800
I've been cured.

683
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,560
I'm not afraid of trains anymore!

684
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,640
No hard feelings, Ray.

685
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,920
Yes.

686
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,640
- Yes?
- Yes.

687
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,920
Yes.

688
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,640
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

689
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,280
I love you so much.

690
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,960
I'm so sorry I tried to hide you.

691
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,920
I can't wait to marry you.

692
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,200
I can't wait to marry you.

693
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,280
So, let's... let's do it.

694
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,840
Let's do it, let's do it right now.

695
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,920
- Right now?
- Right now.

696
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,480
I'm off-duty. My dad's here.

697
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,160
His schedule's unpredictable.

698
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,160
So, let's... let's do it.

699
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,840
Right now. Tonight.

700
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,680
Yeah. Okay.

701
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,360
- Okay? Okay!
- Okay.

702
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,320
You're not married yet.

703
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,120
Champagne?

704
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,200
I wanna tell you how much
I appreciate everything you've done

705
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,600
for my daughter.

706
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,920
Thank you,
but, I haven't really done that much.

707
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,440
She's pretty incredible
all on her own.

708
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,040
Yeah, but you make her happy.

709
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,920
That's something
that I ultimately failed at

710
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,680
when I was the main man in her life.

711
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,680
Well, you know, I... I think
you're being too hard on yourself.

712
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,920
I don't need a pep talk.

713
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,640
But I do need you
to do something for me.

714
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,720
I need you to support her.

715
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,160
Of course. Always.

716
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,000
No, I don't think you understand
what I'm trying to say.

717
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,200
Nora's job is very important
to her...

718
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,480
and she can't do it
on that silly little ship of yours.

719
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,520
Nora belongs in the real world...

720
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,520
and you belong together.

721
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,600
I hope you understand
what I'm trying to say here.

722
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,720
Do the right thing, son,
or I'll come back and get you.

723
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,200
I'm only kidding.

724
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,920
Okay. That's what I thought.

725
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,680
But not really.

726
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,880
Eating your feelings, I see?

727
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,320
She's better off without me.

728
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,200
She reached out to you for a reason.

729
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,360
She's an idiot. I'm an idiot.

730
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,160
She's a pain in the ass.
I'm a pain in the ass.

731
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,480
The fact that she's not already
in juvie is a miracle,

732
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,040
and it proves one thing.

733
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,440
What?

734
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,560
I'm no good for her.

735
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,800
Are you sure about that?

736
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,000
You know what?

737
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,000
You've inspired me
to forego this evil thing.

738
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,840
Maybe this old dog
can learn some new tricks.

739
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,640
So you'll stick around for a bit?

740
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,720
Oh, I think it's time both of us
move on to the next chapter.

741
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,680
Promise you'll check in on me
once in a while?

742
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,760
Of course.

743
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,720
I'll never be far.

744
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,040
I love you, Nora-doll.

745
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,560
I love you, Dad.

746
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,720
- Let's go.
- Okay.

747
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,200
Taking off already?

748
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,640
Oh, I hate prolonged goodbyes.

749
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,400
I'd rather slip out while everyone's
in there still having a good time.

750
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,520
So, where are you going?

751
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,640
I was given this Encore
under certain conditions.

752
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,720
I was ordered
to cause pain and misery

753
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,960
and damn more souls to Hell.

754
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,840
But instead, you decided
to check in on your Nora-doll.

755
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,280
I just wanted to make sure
that my little girl's okay.

756
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
And she is.

757
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,360
Thanks to the help of you idiots.

758
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,280
Plus, Astra's going to recall me soon
to an eternity of torture.

759
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,400
I didn't want to bum my daughter out

760
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,800
with all of that
on her wedding night.

761
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,120
I know you'll never forgive me.

762
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,800
To tell you the truth...

763
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,560
I won't, either.
