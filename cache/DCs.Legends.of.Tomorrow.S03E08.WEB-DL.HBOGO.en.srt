1
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,120
Grey's hit.

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,480
We got to get him out of there!

3
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,880
Where's Barry when you need him?

4
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,040
Just tying up some loose ends.

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,200
He's almost at the breach hangar.

6
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,800
If we don't stop him,

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,200
he's gonna blow up
our only ticket home.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,760
Not to mention us.

9
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,520
A little help with that, please.

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,600
No, no, no, no, no!

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,160
Grey! Stay down!

12
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,600
Grey! No!

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,720
Grey!

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,320
Fall back!

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,200
Fall back!

16
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,600
He did it.

17
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,040
- He opened the breach.
- Let's go.

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
Hey.

19
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,480
Barry, the breach is open.
Where are you?

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,920
We got to take him out now.

21
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,640
I have an idea.
Throw another lightning bolt.

22
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,760
- We already tried that.
- Just do it.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,040
Now!

24
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,760
{\an5}Barry, we need to you to hurry up.
Stein's hurt.

25
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,200
{\an5}All right, we're on the move.

26
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,360
He's alive,
but his condition is critical.

27
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,600
All right, Gideon will fix him.

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,000
No, it's too dangerous to move him.

29
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,720
Not if he's Firestorm.

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
Yeah.

31
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,880
Grey! Grey.

32
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,840
Grey, come on.

33
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
{\an5}- Thanks for your help.
- We're not done helping yet.

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,440
{\an5}Our enemies are still on your earth,
Ollie.

35
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,560
Don't call me that.

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,080
{\an5}Give it time, I'll get through
that crusty exterior.

37
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,640
{\an5}- No, you really won't.
- I was talking to you.

38
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,280
- Oh, my God.
- Kara.

39
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,120
What are they doing?

40
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,120
This next sound...

41
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,920
metal through a bone,

42
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,680
that's my favorite.

43
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,640
You should probably close your eyes.

44
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,960
This will all be over in a minute.

45
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,080
{\an5}What are you waiting for?

46
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,760
- Do it.
- I'm trying.

47
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
I'm trying but...

48
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,200
Mitts off, Mengele.

49
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,040
{\an5}- Ray?
- Hi, how are you?

50
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
{\an5}Oh, I got your S.O.S.
How was the wedding?

51
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
{\an5}All right, don't worry.

52
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,960
{\an5}The rest of the Legends are here
and we're busting everybody out.

53
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,920
Wait, we need someone
to lock the time vault.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,840
{\an5}I got it.
You guys get Kara out of here.

55
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,120
{\an5}- Be careful.
- Okay.

56
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
{\an5}Look, I know I'm late to the party,

57
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,120
{\an5}but why have Nazi doppelgangers
taken over S.T.A.R. Labs?

58
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,680
They're from Earth-X.
They hate everybody.

59
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,560
They want to steal Kara's heart,
and they have this giant robot.

60
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,400
Oh, I've actually fought one
of those before.

61
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,040
Little known fact the suit
doesn't just shrink...

62
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Ray!

63
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,640
It embiggens.

64
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,880
<i>Attention all prisoners:</i>

65
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,000
{\an5}<i>Great news.
The cavalry has arrived.</i>

66
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,160
About time.

67
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,920
{\an5}I knew I could count on you,
Pretty.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,320
{\an5}Did you bring beers?

69
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,600
Better yet, an army.

70
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,440
Who needs an army
when you got Legends?

71
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,360
We have a problem.

72
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,240
{\an5}I need you to wake up, Kara.

73
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,040
{\an5}The General is no longer safe here.

74
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,280
I'm well aware.

75
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,120
{\an5}Retreat to the troop carrier
and prepare for the invasion.

76
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,320
- Without you?
- I'm staying.

77
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,760
{\an5}Supergirl is not leaving here alive.

78
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,240
{\an5}Do not make it personal.
That is not a good idea.

79
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,200
{\an5}Are you questioning
your Fuhrer's orders?

80
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,360
{\an5}Of course not.

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
General.

82
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,720
Stay here. Stay safe.

83
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,680
{\an5}And I'll be back for you
with her heart.

84
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,120
{\an5}So this is Earth-1? Cute.

85
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,800
{\an5}- We need to find Kara.
- Then we need to split up.

86
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,760
<i>- I got Supergirl.</i>
- I got Group B.

87
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,040
- You're late.
- Don't mind him.

88
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,960
He's just pissy
'cause he came out of a steel box.

89
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,720
Actually he's always like this.

90
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,440
What the hell?

91
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,120
{\an5}- How much further, Ray?
- Waverider's on the roof.

92
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,720
{\an5}How do you two know each other again?

93
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,840
{\an5}- We used to date.
- We used to date.

94
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,040
That's awkward.

95
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,280
Careful.

96
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,960
{\an5}Oliver got the girl,
I got a life of adventure

97
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,160
on a time-traveling spaceship.

98
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,880
Step away from her.

99
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,520
{\an5}There's no way.

100
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,080
{\an5}My grandparents didn't survive
the Holocaust

101
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,120
{\an5}so the world could be ruled
by Nazis. So if you want Kara,

102
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,320
{\an5}you got to go through me.

103
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,440
{\an5}And even if you do,
you're not gonna win.

104
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,440
{\an5}'Cause we will not back down.
We will keep fighting.

105
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,200
{\an5}So get the hell off our earth
while you still can.

106
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,280
{\an5}As final words go,

107
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,560
{\an5}those weren't bad.

108
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,400
Lower your weapon.

109
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,320
Or I'll kill her.

110
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,080
This guy's like the Terminator.

111
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,280
Why are you laughing?

112
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,600
{\an5}I just love a good
pop culture reference

113
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,160
{\an5}in a moment of crisis.

114
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,520
Also, that!

115
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,680
Let's kick some ass!

116
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,920
Her neck doesn't seem invulnerable
so I will say again.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,240
Lower your weapon.

118
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,720
Don't listen to him. Just shoot her.

119
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
No! No.

120
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,240
{\an5}I can save your wife's life.

121
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,000
There's only one way to save me.

122
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,680
We have friends at S.T.A.R. Labs.

123
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,000
There are ways to do this
without hurting Kara.

124
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,200
He's lying.

125
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,880
Do it for the Fatherland,
just kill her!

126
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,360
{\an5}I thought that jerk
was supposed to be dead.

127
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,440
{\an5}- Hey, hey.
- Hi.

128
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay

129
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,920
You're safe. You're safe.

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,080
{\an5}Oh, I shouldn't have said
what I said.

131
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,360
{\an5}What if it was the last thing
we ever said to each other?

132
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,800
{\an5}It doesn't matter. Nothing matters
except that I love you.

133
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,840
{\an5}Okay? I don't need anything else.
I don't need to get married.

134
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,200
I just...

135
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,400
I just want to be with you.

136
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
- Okay.
- Okay.

137
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,640
Gideon, fix him!

138
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,480
His pressure's dropping.
We have to stanch the bleeding.

139
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,840
<i>Right away, Dr. Snow.</i>

140
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,400
Jax, relax.

141
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,600
Professor's going to be fine.
He's a tough bastard.

142
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,240
Jackson's hit.

143
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,040
- I can't find an entry wound.
- Look at their vitals.

144
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,240
It must be
because of their connection.

145
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
What the hell does that mean?

146
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,680
Even though Jax isn't injured,

147
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,680
their life functions must still
be linked somehow.

148
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,200
- Well, how do we unlink them?
- We can't.

149
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,600
Their connection's the only thing
keeping the professor alive.

150
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,640
Are you okay?

151
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,520
I can't even begin to answer
that right now.

152
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,560
We should be on our honeymoon.

153
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,160
We should be on a beach,
drinking mai tais out of coconut.

154
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,840
Instead we're on this space ship,

155
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,920
looking for our friends'
evil doppelgangers.

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,200
- We should have just eloped.
- Yeah.

157
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,360
- Kara?
- Alex?

158
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,120
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

159
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,920
- I can't believe they almost...
- I know, I know.

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,440
- I thought I lost you.
- Me too.

161
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,200
So much for getting away
from it all, huh?

162
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,160
I should have known better
than to think that a wedding

163
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,040
on another Earth is gonna solve
all of our problems.

164
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,680
Yeah, but...

165
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,800
you know, fighting
the evil versions of ourselves

166
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,560
does kind of put those problems
in perspective, doesn't it?

167
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,000
Way to see the silver lining.

168
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,320
Hey there, friend.

169
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,120
No need to numb your feelings
with alcohol.

170
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,360
The ghost is back.

171
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,600
No, not a ghost. I'm Leo.

172
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,240
Leo Snart from Earth-X.

173
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,600
It's okay, buddy.

174
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,520
I know you're hurting over Firestorm.

175
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,360
Get your hand off me.

176
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,600
What is wrong, partner? Talk to me.

177
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,960
You're not my partner.

178
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,880
You're a gangbanger.

179
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,000
I think you mean "doppelganger."

180
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,120
And there was one of you
on my earth, too.

181
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,120
Rest his soul.

182
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,720
Wait. I'm dead on Planet Nazi?

183
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,920
Let me guess.

184
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
In a fire?

185
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,560
You just kept going back
into that burning police station

186
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,000
until the last officer
had been rescued.

187
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,640
I died trying to save pigs?

188
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,480
I'm gonna be sick.

189
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,400
How you feeling, Jax?

190
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,800
Oh, don't worry about me.
How's Grey?

191
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,640
I have him sedated. Don't worry.

192
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,080
Gideon and I are doing everything
we can to fix him.

193
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,520
Okay. Good.

194
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,520
Still no improvement?

195
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,000
He's getting worse.

196
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,440
Marty or Jax?

197
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,280
Both.

198
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,560
I just can't believe
there's nothing Gideon can do.

199
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,480
Medically speaking, Professor Stein
shouldn't even be alive right now.

200
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,120
The only thing that kept him
from dying is...

201
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,520
- Jax. Bonding with him.
- Yeah.

202
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,480
Jax is basically functioning
as a human life-support machine,

203
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,480
able to keep the professor alive
but...

204
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,320
only for so long.

205
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,440
Does Jax know?

206
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,680
That he's gonna die too?

207
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,360
I didn't know how to tell him.

208
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
It'll be okay.

209
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,200
We got a whole mess
of smart people on this ship.

210
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,720
Somebody's gonna figure out
something.

211
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Okay.

212
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,240
Oh, man. I have just died
and went to geek heaven.

213
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,920
Told you we picked the right guy.

214
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,720
Picked the right guy to do what?

215
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,840
Hunt Nazis.

216
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,720
Meet out resident Earth-X expert,
The Ray.

217
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,160
Well, you can use my real name
Ray Terrill.

218
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,680
Your secret identity is your
first name with the word "the"

219
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,240
- in front of it?
- Yeah.

220
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,160
Why? What's your secret identity?

221
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,840
- Mr. Terrific.
- Really?

222
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,800
That's a little boast-y,
don't you think?

223
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,280
Nah, it's just one
of my favorite wrestlers.

224
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,440
Still... that's... you should
change your name.

225
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,640
- Can we talk about these Nazis?
- They vanished.

226
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,040
Owing to the fact that they
have their own Waverider.

227
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,880
A Nazi Waverider?

228
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,120
Yeah, we had been tracking them

229
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,360
using the radiation
signature given off by Overgirl

230
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,040
- because of her...
- Extreme exposure

231
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
to the solar radiation.

232
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,480
Are these readings right?

233
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah, of course they're right. Why?

234
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,920
Well because the trace
radiation readings on here

235
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,400
are slowly approaching
the Chandrasekhar Limit.

236
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,120
- Which means?
- Overgirl isn't just dying...

237
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,480
Yeah, if she doesn't get
Supergirl's heart,

238
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,240
she'll create a supernova
that will destroy...

239
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,120
the entire Midwest.

240
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,120
Jef... Jefferson?

241
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
Jefferson.

242
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,200
I need...
I need to tell you something.

243
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,040
Well, talk fast.

244
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,920
Because unless you're sedated,
Gideon can't do her thing,

245
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,120
patch you back up.

246
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,320
Can't you see that...

247
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
I'm dying?

248
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,120
What... what are you talking about,
man?

249
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm old, Jefferson.

250
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,920
And even if I hadn't been shot,
no one lives forever.

251
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,360
Grey, I don't even want to hear you
talking like that, man.

252
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,240
As long as we're connected,

253
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,680
I'm nothing more than an anchor
around your neck.

254
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,840
Which is why you must help me.

255
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,400
I don't understand. I...

256
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,240
Not Cisco's drug.

257
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,000
Gideon resynthesized the liquid.

258
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,720
She assures me it will free you
from my body's biology.

259
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,880
And it will free you of mine.

260
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,320
I'm the only thing
that's keeping you alive, man.

261
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,160
You're asking me to kill you, Grey.

262
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,440
I'm asking you

263
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,800
to let me die so that you may live.

264
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,440
- Please hand me the vial.
- No.

265
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,160
I know, I know you think

266
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,080
you're strong enough for both of us.

267
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,160
But unless I do this, we'll both die.

268
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,520
- Then we'll both die. I don't...
- No.

269
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,640
You...

270
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,760
You have your whole life
ahead of you.

271
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,840
Grey.

272
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,680
But now it's time

273
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,280
for you to let me go.

274
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,720
- No, I'm not ready for you to go.
- I'm not either.

275
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,120
But when you think about it,

276
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
compared to the Cosmos,

277
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,680
one's life is but a blink of an eye.

278
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
Really?

279
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,120
You're gonna lecture me
about astrophysics right now?

280
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,120
Grey, please don't do this to me.

281
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,600
I can't do this.

282
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,480
You once told me...

283
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,480
that I was like your father,
and I said

284
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,840
you were my son.

285
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,160
How could a father do anything less?

286
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,760
- Grey.
- Please. Please.

287
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,440
Thank you, Jefferson.

288
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,040
Grey, no, don't.

289
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,920
Stay with me, please.
I'd prefer not to be alone.

290
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah.

291
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Please...

292
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,280
tell Clarissa and Lily
that I love them.

293
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,040
I promise.

294
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,360
Thank you, Jefferson...

295
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
for the adventure of a lifetime.

296
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,440
I hope your life is long

297
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,480
and full of love.

298
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,200
Just as mine...

299
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,280
has been.

300
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
Grey.

301
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
Grey.

302
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
No.

303
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,000
No, no.

304
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,400
Jax.

305
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,600
He did it for me.

306
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,760
Where's Jax?

307
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,800
I'll get it, honey.

308
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,440
Jefferson.

309
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,360
I'm sorry.

310
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,480
Oh, no.

311
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,600
No, no.

312
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,800
How are you holding up?

313
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,080
I'll cry at the funeral.

314
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,320
Sara.

315
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,320
I'm fine.

316
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,160
We need to gather everyone.

317
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,960
Overgirl's gonna go nuclear,
and the Earth-Xers are gonna

318
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,600
use their Waverider
to threaten Central City

319
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,240
and leverage us
into surrendering Kara.

320
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,440
How do you know that?

321
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,320
It's exactly what I would do.

322
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,640
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

323
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,120
For being so weak.

324
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,160
<i>I've managed to stabilize
her deterioration,</i>

325
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,600
<i>but without a transplant
she'll be dead within an hour.</i>

326
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,800
Quiet!

327
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,120
Now don't you listen to her.

328
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,800
There is more strength in you

329
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,920
than in this entire planet
of lesser humans combined.

330
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,880
Nice outfit.

331
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,880
Yeah, I didn't want to feel left out.

332
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,120
Where are we with locating
the other Waverider?

333
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,080
We got a pretty good idea.
I mean, we've all heard

334
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,680
of the Chandrasekhar Limit,
I assume?

335
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,200
The data indicates it's still
in the vicinity of Central City.

336
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,920
Which also indicates that Overgirl
isn't long for this world.

337
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,200
Which means that this world
isn't long for this world.

338
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,680
Failure's not an option.

339
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,200
Losing is not an option.
We are gonna win.

340
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,600
And we are gonna show these
people that this earth

341
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,840
belongs to us.

342
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Great speech.

343
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,440
<i>Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Queen,</i>

344
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,800
<i>but we're being hailed
by a fellow Timeship.</i>

345
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
Put it on.

346
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,040
- What do you want?
- To offer a truce.

347
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,520
In exchange for what?

348
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,240
<i>We will return to our earth
peacefully</i>

349
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,680
<i>if you meet my one demand.</i>

350
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,640
<i>Supergirl comes with us.</i>

351
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,240
Here's another difference
between you and me.

352
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,680
I don't abandon my friends.

353
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,080
All right.

354
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,520
- Everybody ready to go?
- Never been more.

355
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,280
We can't bring Marty back,

356
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,360
but we can protect the city he loved,
and the family he left behind.

357
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,840
For the Professor.

358
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,920
Now let's go kick some ass.

359
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,920
<i>Let them run.</i>

360
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,280
We'll turn this city
into a mausoleum.

361
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,560
Kill them all.

362
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,920
Yes, sir!

363
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,960
Excuse me.

364
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,960
You can't just go around
roasting people.

365
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,160
- Why not?
- You ever heard of due process?

366
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,360
- Rule of law?
- No.

367
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,400
Could use a little help here.

368
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,480
I got you covered.

369
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,360
This is just like Star Raiders
on Atari except it's real.

370
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,000
Cut the chatter, Red 2.
Fly the ship.

371
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,240
- Launching torpedo one.
- You don't have to say it out loud.

372
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,600
Okay, guys, is it just me
or is this not working?

373
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,840
- It's not working.
- It's not working.

374
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,240
You need to take down their shields.

375
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,200
Open fire!

376
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,160
Guys, this isn't working.
I think we need a bigger gun.

377
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,840
Way ahead of you.

378
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
General, we've got inbound.

379
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,960
- Then fire counter-measures.
- We can't.

380
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,720
It's hovering directly off our bow.

381
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,920
General, would you care
to step outside?

382
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,680
Waiting for some good news here.

383
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,800
I don't have any for you, man.

384
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,120
The only way to take out
their shields is to get

385
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,720
someone onboard that ship.

386
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,600
We're on our way.

387
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,160
We're on the bridge, Felicity.

388
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,080
And we don't know
what we're looking for.

389
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm working on it.

390
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,720
Felicity's got it.
I'm sending you the source code

391
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,840
for their deflector shields.

392
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,040
Yeah, got it.
Manual override protocol.

393
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,000
If I am reading this correctly,
all you need to do now is...

394
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,160
Hit the big, blinking red button.

395
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,280
Got it. Shields are down.

396
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,760
Harry, you think you can
handle this bad boy?

397
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,960
Walk in the park, Kazansky.

398
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,360
- Where are you going?
- Getting our friends off that ship.

399
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,040
Count of 10,
hit them with everything we got.

400
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,120
You got it.

401
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Come on, Ramon.

402
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
Nailed it!

403
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,000
Go on! End it.

404
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,080
End it!

405
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,920
What's stopping you?

406
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,880
Oh, I forgot.

407
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,360
Barry Allen is above killing.

408
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,760
Isn't that right?

409
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
Get out of here.

410
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,800
I wonder what face
I'll be wearing next time we meet.

411
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,760
Flash.

412
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,880
Can't wait.

413
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,480
<i>I'm detecting dangerously
high radiation levels.</i>

414
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,000
Disembodied computer voice
lady's right.

415
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,800
Supergirl-X is about to go
super-nova.

416
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,280
Supergirl, your doppelganger's about
to have a meltdown.

417
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,760
- What do I do?
- You need to fly her up.

418
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,600
Up. And away.

419
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,760
Now.

420
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,360
No!

421
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,800
I'm gonna kill you.

422
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,960
Wha... what?

423
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,200
How did you?

424
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,400
I figured it'd take the man
of steel to catch the girl of steel.

425
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,120
That and, you know,
a tremendous amount of help.

426
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,760
Thank you both.
This world owes you a lot.

427
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,560
Well, it's my world too so...

428
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,000
Punching out Nazis
is kind of our thing.

429
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,600
Well, if you ever need us to do
any punching over on Earth-X

430
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,720
- just let us know.
- Will do.

431
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,520
- Take care, Barry.
- Take care, Ray.

432
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,200
- Barry, I need a hug.
- Okay.

433
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,440
- Be good, Leo.
- Always.

434
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,520
I'm gonna get ready.

435
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,720
- You got this?
- Yeah.

436
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,760
All right, fellas.
You ready to go home?

437
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,640
Sure. So how does this thing work?

438
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,520
It's a very complex two-part process.

439
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
One, I open a breach. Two...

440
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,320
You walk through it.

441
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Cool.

442
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,960
Leo?

443
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,240
I think I'm gonna stick
around here for a little while.

444
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,360
I...

445
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,240
I won't stay here forever.

446
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,520
I will come home to you.

447
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Promise.

448
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
Okay.

449
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,520
- I love you.
- I love you.

450
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,880
Clarissa asked me
to say a few words.

451
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,560
But, as you all know,

452
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,280
it was Grey... Martin
who was the wordy one.

453
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,360
But...

454
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,960
I got used to hearing
his voice inside my head.

455
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,800
And even now,

456
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
I can still hear him.

457
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,160
'Cause even though he's gone,
he's still a part of me.

458
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,760
He's still a part of all of us.

459
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,400
He was the best man
right until the end.

460
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,520
The best teacher.

461
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,440
Friend.

462
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,360
Husband.

463
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Father.

464
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Clarissa...

465
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,840
I'm so, so sorry.

466
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,920
I couldn't save him. I...

467
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,920
All he wanted was to come home.

468
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,960
To you, and you, and Ronnie.

469
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,200
To his family.

470
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,760
Oh, Jefferson.

471
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,120
You were his family too.

472
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
I just...

473
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,840
I don't know how to do any
of this without him.

474
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,040
Then, don't.

475
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,680
You said it yourself.
He's still part of you.

476
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,120
That's it, big guy. Let it out.

477
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,760
Allergies.

478
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,040
Good-bye, my love.

479
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,920
Thank you for believing in me.

480
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,120
Tell Ronnie I miss him.

481
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,840
Thank you for bringing me home
to her.

482
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,840
So, you're going to another earth,
and I'm going to another time.

483
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,280
Yeah, that's kind of
how we roll, huh?

484
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,440
Totally normal.

485
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,280
- Should we...
- Should we...

486
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,320
- It's... it's a hug thing, okay.
- Okay.

487
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,800
Thank you for putting things
in perspective for me.

488
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,840
Does that mean you're gonna
take my advice on Maggie?

489
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,520
Yes, I'm gonna trust my instincts.

490
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,760
I mean, there's got to be
somebody else out there for me.

491
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,000
- Right?
- For sure.

492
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,160
Just like there's somebody
else out there for you.

493
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,400
And for more than just a night.

494
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,800
That's funny.

495
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,040
- That was my takeaway too.
- Boss.

496
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,640
Ship's ready.

497
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,360
Catch you on the other side.

498
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,200
- You hit that?
- Shut up.

499
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,120
You ready?

500
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,800
Oh, so, so ready, yeah.

501
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,440
Thank you guys for everything.

502
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,680
And thanks for inviting us
to your wedding.

503
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,760
Sorry it didn't turn out
the way you wanted it to.

504
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,000
- Well, at least it was memorable.
- Yes.

505
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,000
Well, we'll be back out
for the do-over.

506
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,800
Iris and I talked about it and...

507
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,320
And yeah, we're just gonna
get ourselves a justice of the peace

508
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,880
and get it done, quick and simple.

509
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,280
Fewer Nazis that way.

510
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,680
Well, take care, guys.

511
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,040
- Oh.
- Oh, that's good. That's...

512
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
Yeah, bring it in.

513
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,640
All right.

514
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,120
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

515
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,320
You guys really not going to have
a wedding now after all that?

516
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,840
- Now she's pro-wedding.
- Hey.

517
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,840
Well... I mean, we've already
had the ceremony.

518
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,120
So all we need to do now
is exchange vows and rings.

519
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,000
Hey, can't a mayor marry people?

520
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,840
Very flattered, but I think
that we would have to be

521
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,440
within the limits of Star City
for it to be official.

522
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,720
And we definitely want it
to be official.

523
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,120
Well, if you want it to be personal,
I think we know a guy who's ordained.

524
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,520
It's a good thing I didn't vomit,
right?

525
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

526
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,560
Are you okay?

527
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,640
- A little warning next time?
- Sorry.

528
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,920
What's up?

529
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,760
You got ordained to marry
your brother and Carly, right?

530
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,000
Yeah.

531
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,720
We were hoping that you could give us
the same treatment.

532
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,320
Wow, really? I'm honored.

533
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,560
- Yeah?
- I am.

534
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,800
All right. Well, let's do it.

535
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,360
Okay, that's great.

536
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,160
I guess that makes you

537
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,040
the best man
and you the maid-of-honor.

538
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,200
- "Honored" is correct.
- All right.

539
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,000
- Let's get into position.
- Oh, my goodness.

540
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,200
- You're here.
- Okay.

541
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,440
- You're there, you're there.
- Oh, I see.

542
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,280
Did you guys write vows
or you just want the boilerplate?

543
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,400
Yes, I... wrote mine.

544
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,360
I tried to write mine.

545
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,120
But then I realized
that I didn't need to.

546
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,520
My entire life has been marked
by two things.

547
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,480
The first one is change.

548
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,160
From when I was a kid
to when I was an adult,

549
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,720
things were always changing.

550
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,640
But no matter
how different things became

551
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,840
or what new challenges
I had to face,

552
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,040
I always had the other thing
that my life was marked by.

553
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,240
And that's you.

554
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,840
You've always been there.

555
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,360
As a friend, as a partner,

556
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,800
as the love of my life.

557
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,120
You're my home, Iris.

558
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,680
And that's one thing
that will never change.

559
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,160
That was really nice.

560
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,320
When I was nine years old
I wanted to be a ballerina.

561
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,520
Remember?

562
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,360
Even though
I was not a very good dancer.

563
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,440
And the day of the recital I froze.

564
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,000
I couldn't move, and I wanted to die.

565
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,520
And then I looked in the audience
and I saw you.

566
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,920
And you got up
and you climbed onto stage

567
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,360
and you did
that whole routine with me.

568
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,240
And we killed it.

569
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,680
I mean...

570
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,040
We brought the house down.

571
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,120
And from that moment, I knew that...

572
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,680
With you by my side,
anything was possible.

573
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,720
The Flash may be the city's hero,
but you, Barry Allen,

574
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,760
you're my hero.

575
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,200
And I am happy...

576
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,880
excited...

577
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,920
and honored to be your wife.

578
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
Wonderful.

579
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Well then, I pronounce you both...

580
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,280
Wait! Wait.
Wait, just one second.

581
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,800
If you guys don't mind...
I mean if you don't mind,

582
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,000
really if you don't mind,
but would you marry us too?

583
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,080
Will you marry me?

584
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,680
I thought...

585
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,440
I mean, I thought you didn't
believe in marriage.

586
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,480
No, but I believe in you, and...

587
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,600
I believe that no matter
what life throws at us,

588
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,160
our love can conquer it,
married, unmarried.

589
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,440
I love you.

590
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,800
My greatest fear...

591
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,800
My greatest fear in life
is losing you.

592
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,880
- I...
- Yes.

593
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,520
Okay.

594
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,680
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

595
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,760
I do.

596
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,800
I do.

597
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,920
John, what do you say?

598
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,920
You kidding me, Oliver?

599
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I'm the guy for the past six years

600
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,880
that's been trying to keep
you two together.

601
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,360
It's only fitting that I marry you.

602
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,840
Okay. Vows?

603
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,080
- No.
- No.

604
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,800
I mean, we can't do better than them.

605
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,200
Definitely not.
We kind of did those fake vows

606
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,280
when we had that fake wedding

607
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,480
with that psychopath
serial-killer archer lady.

608
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,600
I remember saying something
along the lines of...

609
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,240
You're the very best part of me.

610
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,160
Felicity, I'm a better human being...

611
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,760
Just because I've loved you.

612
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,840
Well, since we don't have
any rings just yet.

613
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,360
I'll skip right to the part
where I say this,

614
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,280
Oliver Jonas Queen,

615
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,040
Felicity Megan Smoak,

616
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,880
Bartholomew Henry Allen,

617
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,000
and Iris Ann West...

618
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,120
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

619
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,440
Please, kiss your brides.
