00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:44,275
That what they say about me now?

159
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:45,780
Paranoid?

160
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,785
DAN: Look, Comedian made
a lot of enemies over the years...

161
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:50,445
...even among his friends.

162
00:19:50,445 --> 00:19:52,785
RORSCHACH:
Speaking of friends, how's Hollis Mason?

163
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,619
He wrote that book. Said some bad things
about the Comedian in it.

164
00:19:57,619 --> 00:20:01,859
I don't like what you're implying,
and I like being followed even less.

165
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:06,862
Maybe I was keeping an eye on you,
in case someone's gunning for masks.

166
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:11,704
-You were never that sentimental.
-Attack on one is attack on all of us.

167
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:14,579
What do you suggest we do about it?

168
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:16,642
Retribution.

169
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:21,350
-Watchmen are over.
-Says Tricky Dick.

170
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,284
Says me.

171
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,519
Nobody knows who you are.

172
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,663
You can give it up,
try and have a normal life.

173
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:34,733
That what you have now?
A normal life?

174
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:39,102
When you walk down the street
in a city dying of rabies...

175
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:40,739
...past the human cockroaches...

176
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,671
...talking about their heroin
and child pornography...

177
00:20:43,671 --> 00:20:45,368
...do you really feel normal?

178
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:49,277
Least I'm not the one
still hiding behind a mask.

179
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:52,413
No.

180
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,214
You're hiding in plain sight.

181
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,752
Be seeing you, Dan.

182
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,728
A maintenance hatch
will let you out two blocks north.

183
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,625
Yeah, I remember.

184
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:08,859
Came here often,
when we were partners.

185
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:10,935
DAN: Those were great times, huh,
Rorschach?

186
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:14,669
-What happened?
-You quit.

187
00:21:41,902 --> 00:21:42,926
<i>MAN:
Mr. Veidt...</i>

188
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:45,864
...to date,
you're one of only two Watchmen...

189
00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:48,473
...ever to reveal their true identity
to the world...

190
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,576
...the first being Hollis Mason.

191
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:53,736
And you've certainly profited greatly
by it...

192
00:21:53,736 --> 00:21:59,181
...turning your superhero alter ego,
Ozymandias, into a billion-dollar industry:

193
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:02,412
Toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering.

194
00:22:02,412 --> 00:22:04,648
I understand there's a movie
in the works.

195
00:22:04,648 --> 00:22:09,022
-I'm not hearing a question, Mr. Roth.
ROTH: I'm sorry. Do you think--

196
00:22:09,022 --> 00:22:11,755
The Watchmen resent me
for prostituting their struggle?

197
00:22:11,755 --> 00:22:14,662
It's a fair question.
Yes, it's crossed my mind...

198
00:22:14,662 --> 00:22:17,860
...some of my old colleagues
might see it that way...

199
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,030
...just as you're clearly aware
that biased journalism...

200
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,801
...sells more magazines.

201
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:29,078
The merchandising arm of Veidt Industries
is funding our work with Dr. Manhattan.

202
00:22:29,078 --> 00:22:32,184
We recently expanded our research facility
in Antarctica...

203
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,583
...in the hope of developing cheap,
renewable sources of energy...

204
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:38,747
...that we might eliminate
the world’s reliance on fossil fuels.

205
00:22:38,747 --> 00:22:41,359
Now, it doesn't take
a political scientist...

206
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,929
...to see that our Cold War
with the Russians isn't ideological...

207
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:48,590
...it's based upon fear.
Fear of not having enough.

208
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:52,666
But if we make resources infinite...

209
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,932
...ah...

210
00:22:54,932 --> 00:22:57,201
...we make war obsolete.

211
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:01,878
I would hope the other Watchmen
understand that...

212
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,744
...wherever they may be.

213
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:08,218
Thanks for your time.

214
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:17,123
-You look good, Adrian.
-Dan.

215
00:23:17,123 --> 00:23:19,527
It's been too long.

216
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:25,328
So Rorschach thinks
someone's hunting the Watchmen, huh?

217
00:23:26,006 --> 00:23:27,871
You think it's possible?

218
00:23:27,871 --> 00:23:30,771
Statistically, one murder
doesn't equal a trend.

219
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,879
Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan.

220
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:37,881
And so was the Comedian.
He was practically a Nazi.

221
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:40,743
You know that better than anyone.

222
00:23:40,743 --> 00:23:43,115
I'm not here because I miss him.

223
00:23:43,115 --> 00:23:44,620
It's obviously occurred to Rorschach...

224
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,760
...that we're the only ones
who know each other's identities.

225
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,354
Actually, the whole world knows yours.

226
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:53,599
That's why I'm warning you first.

227
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:59,194
Thank you, Dan...

228
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:04,607
...but I fear there's something
much more real to worry about...

229
00:24:04,607 --> 00:24:07,372
...than Rorschach's mask killer.

230
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:13,410
If the Russians do launch their nukes,
can Jon really stop them?

231
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,215
The Soviets have 51,000
warheads stockpiled.

232
00:24:17,215 --> 00:24:20,587
Even if Jon stops 99 percent of them...

233
00:24:20,587 --> 00:24:24,958
...the 1 percent that get through
could still kill every living thing on Earth.

234
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,066
Even Dr. Manhattan
can't be everywhere at once.

JON:
Good evening, Rorschach.

254
00:26:05,126 --> 00:26:08,790
RORSCHACH:
Dr. Manhattan, you know why I'm here.

255
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,401
JON:
Yes...

256
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:13,639
...but you're going to leave disappointed.

257
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:17,537
Rorschach. You shouldn’t be here.
You're a wanted man.

258
00:26:17,537 --> 00:26:19,905
RORSCHACH:
Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

259
00:26:19,905 --> 00:26:22,138
I have a real name I've been using
a couple years.

260
00:26:22,138 --> 00:26:23,339
Now, Try it.

261
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:25,609
Whatever you say, Laurie.

262
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:27,013
What are you doing here?

263
00:26:27,013 --> 00:26:29,519
JON:
The Comedian is dead.

264
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,782
Rorschach wants me
to look into my future...

265
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:34,593
...see if the killer is ever
publicly identified.

266
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,855
Already warned Dreiberg.
Came to warn you too.

267
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:42,933
Even if I wanted to help...

268
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:47,438
...my future is blocked
by some kind of temporal interference.

269
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,901
-I cannot see it clearly.
-Interference? Caused by what?

270
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:55,479
In all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.

271
00:26:56,216 --> 00:27:00,312
If the United States and Soviet Union
engage in all-out war...

272
00:27:00,312 --> 00:27:04,479
...the resulting blast wave would produce
a sudden burst of tachyons...

273
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:09,617
...particles which travel backward
through what you perceive as time...

274
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:13,596
...therefore obscuring my vision
of the present.

275
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,799
I must return to my work.

276
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:17,095
RORSCHACH:
Wait a minute.

277
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:19,761
What if that's why
someone wants us out of the way?

278
00:27:19,761 --> 00:27:22,169
So we can't do anything to stop it?

279
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:24,173
Goodbye, Rorschach.

280
00:27:24,173 --> 00:27:26,608
RORSCHACH: Took a lot of effort
to get in here to see you.

281
00:27:26,608 --> 00:27:28,110
I'm not leaving--

282
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:31,714
--till I've had my say.

283
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:42,160
Seems like there's a lot of things
you don't tell me these days.

284
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,024
I didn't wanna worry you prematurely.

285
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:49,628
If Adrian and I can solve the energy crisis,
war may be averted.

286
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:51,861
LAURIE:
But you always say time is simultaneous.

287
00:27:52,572 --> 00:27:55,439
If that's true,
then how can you change the future?

288
00:27:55,439 --> 00:28:00,602
If only you could perceive time as I do.

289
00:28:00,602 --> 00:28:02,042
Please let me show you.

290
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:12,958
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
I was a hero, goddamn it!

291
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:16,186
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

292
00:28:16,186 --> 00:28:18,796
I'm putting food on the table
for you and your child.

293
00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:21,729
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

294
00:28:21,729 --> 00:28:26,065
-It was a mistake. One time.
-Man tries to rape you--

295
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:27,737
Stop!

296
00:28:28,508 --> 00:28:29,975
Your mind goes to dark places...

297
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:32,475
...and you wonder
why I keep the worst from you.

298
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:39,852
-Say hello to Dan for me.
-What?

299
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:44,419
You wanna ask me
to go to dinner with you...

300
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,286
...like we used to...

301
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:50,855
...but you won't.

302
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:53,895
You know I can't.

303
00:28:56,536 --> 00:28:58,800
So you'll call Dan...

304
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,433
...which is only natural.

305
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:04,368
You deserve the comfort of an old friend.

306
00:29:38,678 --> 00:29:40,202
LAURIE:
Dan Dreiberg's table.

307
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:05,133
DAN: Did you know that
he and H.J. were--? I had no idea.

308
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:08,698
You remember that crazy guy?
What'd he call himself?

309
00:30:08,698 --> 00:30:10,365
Captain Carnage.

310

1710
02:33:21,662 --> 02:33:25,962
Long as people think Jon's
still watching us, we’ll be all right...

1711
02:33:26,166 --> 02:33:28,031
...in the end.

1712
02:33:29,670 --> 02:33:31,831
I know what Jon would say:

1713
02:33:31,831 --> 02:33:34,030
Nothing ends.

1714
02:33:35,942 --> 02:33:38,536
Nothing ever ends.

1715
02:34:25,892 --> 02:34:29,658
Seymour, we got nothing
to write about anymore.

1716
02:34:29,658 --> 02:34:31,195
Everyone in the country...

1717
02:34:31,195 --> 02:34:33,629
...every country in the world
are holding hands...

1718
02:34:33,629 --> 02:34:37,065
...and singing songs
about peace and love.

1719
02:34:37,571 --> 02:34:40,438
It's like living in a goddamn
global hippie commune.

1720
02:34:40,438 --> 02:34:44,543
Well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna
be running for president in '88.

1721
02:34:44,543 --> 02:34:46,542
We could run a piece on that.

1722
02:34:46,542 --> 02:34:49,876
Seymour, we don't dignify absurdities
with coverage.

1723
02:34:49,876 --> 02:34:53,884
This is still America, damn it.
Who wants a cowboy in the White House?

1724
02:34:54,621 --> 02:34:58,853
Okay. I could look for something
in the crank file.

1725
02:34:58,853 --> 02:35:00,617
Crank file.

1726
02:35:00,617 --> 02:35:02,785
Whatever. Take some initiative.

1727
02:35:02,785 --> 02:35:05,591
Run whatever you like.
I leave it entirely in your hands.

1728
02:35:12,105 --> 02:35:16,804
<i>Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.</i>

1729
02:35:16,804 --> 02:35:21,437
<i>Tonight, a comedian died in New York.</i>
