1
00:00:32,663 --> 00:00:34,164
Here to the right.

2
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:48,470
Stop.

3
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:54,184
Stay here.

4
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:07,489
Who's there?

5
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:10,951
Relax, sir.

6
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,579
We come in peace.

7
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:14,955
Stay right there!

8
00:01:17,332 --> 00:01:19,001
Relax.

9
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:28,135
How are the cows?

10
00:01:54,828 --> 00:01:58,999
The cops came here...
a few months ago.

11
00:01:59,124 --> 00:02:00,667
What did you tell them?

12
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:03,253
The truth.

13
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:08,467
That I haven't seen you in years.

14
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:15,140
You've gotten old, Pablo.

15
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:22,189
It happens.

16
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:24,483
You look younger.

17
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:27,319
It happens.

18
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:32,574
Life in the country keeps you young.

19
00:02:36,495 --> 00:02:38,789
Be careful, it's hot.

20
00:02:40,624 --> 00:02:42,626
What's your name?

21
00:02:44,628 --> 00:02:46,338
Limón, sir.

22
00:02:46,463 --> 00:02:49,716
Don't give me that shit.
What's your real name?

23
00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:51,885
-Jhon.
-Jhon.

24
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,221
Do you know how to milk a cow, Jhon?

25
00:02:54,763 --> 00:02:57,849
- No, sir.
- Well, you'd better learn.

26
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:02,979
All right, gentlemen.

27
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:06,733
I get up at 5:00am.

28
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:09,986
Good night.

29
00:03:10,737 --> 00:03:12,614
Good night, Dad.

30
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:53,525
It is the state, not individuals,

31
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,404
that has justice in its hands
and the legitimacy to use arms.

32
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:37,319
Gilberto's no longer our partner.
I don't care what he thinks.

33
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:39,446
Have you seen the news?

34
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:42,407
They have issued
a statement without us.

35
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:44,618
Los PEPES is done.

36
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,788
That's only for show.
The Castaños are still in Medellin.

37
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:50,498
Hmm?

38
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:52,042
No one told me anything.

39
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:55,420
Listen to me, Berna.

40
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:58,924
If Escobar comes through that door,
we'll kill him ourselves.

41
00:06:59,049 --> 00:07:00,967
We don't need anybody else.

42
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:03,178
Start moving this product now.

43
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:05,347
That's all fine, Judy.

44
00:07:06,014 --> 00:07:07,891
But if Gilberto finds out, what then?

45
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:12,020
Did you know they're offering
$1.4 million for Los PEPES?

46
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:14,397
I know where they are.

47
00:07:17,525 --> 00:07:19,653
Be careful what you say.

48
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:23,782
That's a dangerous thought, Judy.

49
00:07:23,907 --> 00:07:26,201
I'm not interested in the reward.

50
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,287
I'm interested in my labs.

51
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:32,874
Then at least tell Gilberto yourself.

52
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:39,965
Sir?

53
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:45,470
Hello.

54
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,516
And to what do I owe this lovely surprise?

55
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:52,644
We're at the warehouse in Manrique.

56
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:54,437
This place is full of product.

57
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:57,148
<i>What do you want us to do?
Where do we send it?</i>

58
00:07:57,273 --> 00:08:00,986
Keep it. Think of it as a contribution
to your great cause

59
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:03,655
against the communists in the jungle.

60
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,034
I'm sure you'll find its value
can be put to good use.

61
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:09,411
<i>And what do we do about Judy?</i>

62
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:11,997
<i>Do whatever you think is best.</i>

63
00:08:12,122 --> 00:08:15,667
Well, Gilberto, if you say so.
Thank you very much.

64
00:08:17,335 --> 00:08:21,423
Fidel. Gilberto said
we can keep all of it.

65
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:25,135
What? I thought
we were going home.

66
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,887
We don't know anything
about cocaine.

67
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,765
We'll learn.

68
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,518
If they can, why not us?

69
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:36,813
And what about Judy? Hmm?

70
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:42,652
Judy feels Medellin
is only big enough for one narco.

71
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:46,740
We'll let the Castaños decide which one.

72
00:09:54,015 --> 00:09:55,558
- Fabian.
- Yes?

73
00:09:55,683 --> 00:09:58,478
- Bring the Mercedes. Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am. Right away.

74
00:09:58,603 --> 00:10:00,313
Hurry up, Berna.

75
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:05,318
Relax, Judy.
That meeting can't start without you.

76
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,405
How many people do we have
in the laboratories?

77
00:10:09,531 --> 00:10:11,491
Forty-five in each one.

78
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:13,451
How many supervisors?

79
00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:15,328
Three in each.

80
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:19,249
- We need twice as many shifts.
- Yes, ma'am.

81
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,836
Oscar, Luis! Get in the cars.
The boss is leaving.

82
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:24,254
Yes, sir.

83
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:55,785
- Peña.
- <i>Javier.</i>

84
00:10:57,078 --> 00:10:59,497
- What do you want?
- Something happened, we need to talk.

85
00:10:59,622 --> 00:11:03,418
- I'm busy. I can't talk.
- <i>There 's been an attempt on Judy.</i>

86
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:08,464
She's saying a few things
you might want to hear.

87
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,555
Give me time.

88
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:47,337
- Peña.
- Mr Peña has arrived.

89
00:11:48,463 --> 00:11:50,965
Let's go. Search.

90
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:24,040
Kiko and I built all of this together.
This is all that is left for me.

91
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:25,708
What are the Castaños thinking?

92
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,962
That they can chase me out?

93
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:30,880
I'm not leaving.

94
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:32,882
They don't want you to leave,
they want to kill you.

95
00:12:33,841 --> 00:12:35,927
And what about you?

96
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:39,180
You're in this with me, too.

97
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,104
Look...

98
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:50,525
You brought these guys here.
You got in bed with Cali.

99
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,735
This is all your doing.

100
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,697
This is a fight between narcos.
It's not my problem.

101
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:58,199
Don't call me again.

102
00:12:59,284 --> 00:13:03,329
Berna, last I heard, leaking classified
intelligence is a federal offence.

103
00:13:03,454 --> 00:13:06,582
Especially when it ends up
in the hands of a death squad

104
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,167
that's killed innocent people.

105
00:13:08,293 --> 00:13:10,378
I'm sure some newspaper in America

106
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:13,589
might be interested
in hearing more about that.

107
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:17,135
Are you threatening me?

108
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,346
Yes, I'm threatening you.

109
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,022
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

110
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,400
What do you want?

111
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:34,444
You're a cop.

112
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:38,448
You know perfectly well
where Montecasino is.

113
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:41,409
Where the Castaños are,
and the Rodriguezes.

114
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:44,203
Arrest them.

115
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:47,582
And when you do,
accidentally shoot them in the head.

116
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:50,960
- It doesn't work that way.
- Oh, no?

117
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:52,795
Then how?

118
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:04,849
We'll do it my way.

119
00:14:05,808 --> 00:14:09,562
So you want Judy to be a rat?

120
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:11,314
I don't agree with this, Javier.

121
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:14,817
We are narcos, but we have our honour.

122
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,528
Berna...

123
00:14:17,653 --> 00:14:21,074
you're a fucking drug dealer
who sells poison by the kilo.

124
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:24,202
Fuck your honour.

125
00:14:26,704 --> 00:14:28,122
Says you.

126
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:31,834
You've been happily working
with the information we've provided.

127
00:14:32,835 --> 00:14:35,046
And what have you done?

128
00:14:37,215 --> 00:14:39,842
If you have a better idea, go for it.

129
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:43,346
Otherwise, this is the deal.

130
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:45,848
Judy becomes a confidential informant
to the DEA.

131
00:14:46,557 --> 00:14:49,268
She gives us Cali, everything she knows.

132
00:14:50,353 --> 00:14:52,772
If you don't like it,

133
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:55,525
you can take on the Castaños alone.

134
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:43,364
We haven't heard anything
from him for weeks.

135
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:46,409
We don't even know where he is.

136
00:15:46,534 --> 00:15:49,203
I don't know why you're letting
De Greiff come here.

137
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:51,080
He's coming to scare you.

138
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:54,208
And now you're losing faith in Pablo.

139
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,545
You don't understand, do you?

140
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:02,884
We don't have any more money,
Hermilda.

141
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:05,928
If they take our protection away,
we can't do anything else.

142
00:16:06,053 --> 00:16:09,474
Pablo has many properties.
Don't be so dramatic, Tata.

143
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:12,018
You think someone
is going to invest in us?

144
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:14,270
They're going to give us their money?

145
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:21,277
No one is going to help us.

146
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:24,697
Everyone knows what that would mean.

147
00:16:37,084 --> 00:16:39,170
Whatever he's doing...

148
00:16:40,463 --> 00:16:44,800
wherever my son is,
he's doing it for his family.

149
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:47,970
Don't forget that.

150
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,998
Pablo? Pablo?

151
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:19,418
Can you hear me, Pablo?
Please answer.

152
00:17:34,016 --> 00:17:35,810
Tata, can you hear me?

153
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:41,232
Tata?

154
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:44,819
Can you hear me?

155
00:19:00,353 --> 00:19:03,689
That's a lot of product for men
who don't know how to run this business.

156
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:08,569
We have to be clear with them.
Their work isn't done.

157
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:10,780
Our donation to them is an advance.

158
00:19:11,989 --> 00:19:14,492
Besides, we have to keep them happy.

159
00:19:14,617 --> 00:19:18,788
Their connection with the Americans
is invaluable, brother.

160
00:19:18,913 --> 00:19:20,414
What a fucking joke,

161
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:23,668
the CIA and their war
against the communists.

162
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:28,589
It's a joke, but that friendship
could save our lives one day.

163
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,677
What? Any news about Judy?

164
00:19:32,802 --> 00:19:37,598
The Castaños took their first shot,
a bomb. But they didn't kill her.

165
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:41,102
Since when did it get so fucking hard
to kill someone?

166
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:42,687
What about her assistant?

167
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:45,481
The fat one, what do they call him?
Berna?

168
00:19:45,606 --> 00:19:48,526
He's the one we should kill.
She's just a loud-mouth bitch.

169
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:51,946
Don Berna. Him we found.

170
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:54,448
Where?

171
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:55,908
Here.

172
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:58,369
Out front.

173
00:20:08,504 --> 00:20:10,423
Don Berna!

174
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,385
Welcome to Cali.

175
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,263
Gilberto, thank you, brother.

176
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:20,224
Forgive us, but we weren't expecting you.

177
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:25,146
Don't worry about it.
I'm here to speak to you all.

178
00:20:26,063 --> 00:20:27,857
Very well, brother.

179
00:20:27,982 --> 00:20:30,067
It's about Judy.

180
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:43,098
Thanks. You won't regret it.

181
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:55,778
Tata, are you there?
Can you hear me?

182
00:22:21,637 --> 00:22:22,805
Tata, are you there?

183
00:22:28,102 --> 00:22:30,688
There's no signal here.

184
00:22:30,813 --> 00:22:32,565
I don't know why you keep trying.

185
00:22:34,817 --> 00:22:37,111
Why don't you come and drink with us?

186
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,321
I'll be right there.

187
00:23:41,175 --> 00:23:42,468
There's coffee in the Thermos.

188
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:08,243
He's communicating to his wife via radio.

189
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:10,746
Those are the codes and frequencies.

190
00:24:33,477 --> 00:24:36,188
What do you want, Lugo?
Money? Visa?

191
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,901
No visa, no money,
you understand?

192
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:44,989
Is that what he thinks?

193
00:24:45,114 --> 00:24:47,491
That everyone wants to go
to the United States?

194
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:50,577
I don't want anything.

195
00:24:50,703 --> 00:24:55,290
All I want is for this to end soon and you
to understand the family is in pain.

196
00:24:55,874 --> 00:24:58,252
Find him and kill him.

197
00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:44,918
What are you doing, Pablo?

198
00:27:46,086 --> 00:27:48,630
You don't know how to tie a knot.

199
00:27:57,556 --> 00:28:01,101
This is a cowboy's knot.
This is really good.

200
00:28:34,343 --> 00:28:39,556
<i>Wanted: Pablo Escobar.
Reward 2,700,000 pesos.</i>

201
00:28:39,681 --> 00:28:44,144
<i>Call for free from any city
at 9-800-10-600.</i>

202
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:47,439
<i>In Bogotà, 222-50-12.</i>

203
00:28:47,564 --> 00:28:50,150
<i>In Medellin, 461-11-11.</i>

204
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:52,421
The kids would love to be here.

205
00:29:57,134 --> 00:29:59,136
I've been thinking...

206
00:30:02,973 --> 00:30:05,892
I could buy some land here next to you.

207
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:12,941
Some cows, maybe some sheep.

208
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:18,363
And have my own farm.

209
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:33,503
We could run it together.

210
00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:42,888
What do you think?

211
00:30:59,196 --> 00:31:01,490
We need to finish putting up the wire.

212
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,257
Do you remember when the soldiers
came to our village?

213
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:25,263
You were a tough little boy,
probably only seven or eight years old.

214
00:31:26,723 --> 00:31:31,144
But even in that moment,
you were already the man of the house.

215
00:31:33,397 --> 00:31:38,860
In the face of all that
violence and death, you were strong.

216
00:31:39,486 --> 00:31:41,655
You are a survivor.

217
00:31:42,489 --> 00:31:44,241
A man of action.

218
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:49,579
I knew that day you were destined
for great things, Pablo.

219
00:31:51,331 --> 00:31:54,084
- Good evening.
- Colonel.

220
00:31:54,209 --> 00:31:55,627
Sit.

221
00:31:57,254 --> 00:32:00,966
So, did you decipher those codes?
Are they real?

222
00:32:01,091 --> 00:32:03,677
Yes, Colonel.
I verified the frequencies.

223
00:32:03,802 --> 00:32:05,971
The codes are the same ones
Escobar's wife is using.

224
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:08,306
He'll use them when he calls her.

225
00:32:08,432 --> 00:32:11,184
Did you confirm it's Escobar?
Did you hear him?

226
00:32:12,853 --> 00:32:14,104
No, Colonel, not yet.

227
00:33:00,317 --> 00:33:05,197
Why didn't you answer me when I asked
about me coming here with my family?

228
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:08,408
I wasn't paying that much attention.

229
00:33:09,451 --> 00:33:11,703
But you're paying attention
to me now, right?

230
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:19,211
So, what do you think?

231
00:33:20,086 --> 00:33:23,048
- It's a nice idea.
- Yes, it's a nice idea.

232
00:33:24,758 --> 00:33:28,845
It's a nice idea, now help me.
Put that bucket down here.

233
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:38,104
Now hold on to the pig.

234
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:42,275
Fuck!

235
00:33:44,694 --> 00:33:47,280
Funny that you don't like blood.

236
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:50,450
How strange.

237
00:33:51,493 --> 00:33:53,286
What are you trying to say?

238
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:00,377
Clean yourself.

239
00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:11,888
You know what's funny?

240
00:34:17,561 --> 00:34:19,354
That my dad...

241
00:34:21,273 --> 00:34:26,486
has no fucking idea who I am.

242
00:34:28,738 --> 00:34:30,949
I know very well who you are.

243
00:34:33,702 --> 00:34:38,290
Did you know that I was
one of the world's richest men?

244
00:34:38,415 --> 00:34:39,583
Is that right?

245
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:42,877
You know the President
of the United States knows who I am?

246
00:34:43,003 --> 00:34:45,422
The United States? Disgusting.

247
00:34:46,298 --> 00:34:51,261
I was elected to the
House of Representatives of this country.

248
00:34:51,386 --> 00:34:55,765
Your last name is known throughout
the whole world because of what I did.

249
00:34:57,017 --> 00:34:59,978
- So what? So what? So what?
- So what?

250
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:03,940
And what about you?
What about you?

251
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:10,572
An ignorant old man...

252
00:35:10,697 --> 00:35:12,198
who lives alone.

253
00:35:12,324 --> 00:35:15,577
On this shithole farm.

254
00:35:16,953 --> 00:35:19,914
Who doesn't know his own grandchildren.

255
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:24,252
Not even one fucking picture
of them here.

256
00:35:28,715 --> 00:35:31,676
So I'm nothing more than
an ignorant old man?

257
00:35:33,762 --> 00:35:35,388
That's right.

258
00:35:38,933 --> 00:35:41,978
Now tell me...

259
00:35:43,229 --> 00:35:45,065
Tell me...

260
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,277
what you think of me.

261
00:35:53,907 --> 00:35:56,284
- Who cares?
- I do.

262
00:35:58,078 --> 00:36:00,163
It's important to me.

263
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:07,170
You wanted to come live on this farm
with your wife and kids.

264
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,424
But that's not possible, Pablo.

265
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:15,428
You chose your life!

266
00:36:16,221 --> 00:36:17,847
Be in charge of it.

267
00:36:19,432 --> 00:36:22,268
You want me to tell you
what I think of you?

268
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:26,439
I'm ashamed.

269
00:36:29,943 --> 00:36:32,904
I think you're a murderer.

270
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:40,286
At last, the truth.

271
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,751
At last, the truth.

272
00:36:48,503 --> 00:36:50,463
A truth...

273
00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:56,094
that breaks my heart.

274
00:37:01,224 --> 00:37:03,017
Leave me alone.

275
00:37:38,511 --> 00:37:40,263
Limón.

276
00:37:42,766 --> 00:37:44,350
Yes, sir?

277
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,024
You like it here, right?

278
00:37:52,776 --> 00:37:54,694
Yes, boss.
It's a peaceful place.

279
00:37:56,529 --> 00:37:58,573
Peaceful.

280
00:38:02,243 --> 00:38:03,787
Kneel down.

281
00:38:15,673 --> 00:38:21,638
A few kilometres from here, in a field,
you will find a big tree.

282
00:38:22,555 --> 00:38:26,601
Under that tree
is a buried case of money.

283
00:38:28,436 --> 00:38:29,979
Go and get it.

284
00:38:30,104 --> 00:38:31,314
Are we leaving, boss?

285
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,025
Yes.

286
00:38:35,777 --> 00:38:36,778
Go on.

287
00:38:54,337 --> 00:38:57,090
That's correct, Mrs Escobar.

288
00:38:57,215 --> 00:39:01,511
How long did you think
this arrangement was going to last?

289
00:39:01,636 --> 00:39:04,889
Do you not realise that if
we leave here, they're going to kill us?

290
00:39:05,014 --> 00:39:11,688
If you desire, you have the right
to contract private security services.

291
00:39:11,813 --> 00:39:15,275
Tell us how. We don't have a dime.

292
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,737
That is not our problem.
Mrs Escobar, I'm sorry.

293
00:39:19,863 --> 00:39:21,364
You're sorry?

294
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:24,200
Then help us find asylum
in another country.

295
00:39:24,325 --> 00:39:28,663
I don't have an issue with you
leaving Colombia. But...

296
00:39:28,788 --> 00:39:30,748
But you can't help us find asylum.

297
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,506
That's bullshit!

298
00:39:39,716 --> 00:39:43,136
They're going to... kill us all.

299
00:39:44,387 --> 00:39:46,431
Mama, what's wrong?

300
00:39:50,602 --> 00:39:52,312
Nothing, my love.

301
00:40:04,157 --> 00:40:06,117
I'm sorry, Attorney General...

302
00:40:08,786 --> 00:40:10,914
but I don't know what else to do.

303
00:40:16,711 --> 00:40:22,008
If you're in contact with your husband,
I advise you to express your concern.

304
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:24,177
Tell him to surrender.

305
00:40:25,011 --> 00:40:29,682
The power of the law is your last hope.

306
00:40:30,892 --> 00:40:33,061
Think about your children.

307
00:41:19,524 --> 00:41:21,275
Shit.

308
00:42:37,727 --> 00:42:40,563
- No.
- Yes, before you go to sleep.

309
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:43,900
- Do you like it? Yes?
- No. No.

310
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,684
Fuck.

311
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:22,772
Jhon. What are you doing here?

312
00:43:28,277 --> 00:43:33,866
Where is the money?
The money we gave you. I need it back.

313
00:43:33,991 --> 00:43:36,494
We spent it. It's gone.

314
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:39,413
Relax. I'm not going to hurt you.

315
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:45,503
You've already hurt me.

316
00:43:46,671 --> 00:43:48,381
You've fucked up my life.

317
00:43:56,305 --> 00:43:59,559
I want to put the baby in her crib.
Can I put her down?

318
00:44:01,227 --> 00:44:02,562
Hang on, Maritza.

319
00:44:20,413 --> 00:44:22,039
And this?

320
00:44:25,835 --> 00:44:29,589
That's all we have, Jhon.
It's all we have. We need it.

321
00:44:29,714 --> 00:44:34,010
Please, don't take it. Please.
It's for the baby, please!

322
00:44:34,135 --> 00:44:37,763
You lying... bitch! Get off!

323
00:44:37,889 --> 00:44:40,558
Motherfucker! Bastard!

324
00:44:40,683 --> 00:44:44,478
I should turn you in for the reward!
You deserve it!

325
00:44:44,604 --> 00:44:47,690
Sooner or later, they'll find you anyway.

326
00:44:50,193 --> 00:44:51,819
What did you say?

327
00:44:53,821 --> 00:44:56,157
Are you going to say something?
Are you going to rat on me?

328
00:44:56,282 --> 00:44:59,744
I might! Why shouldn't I?

329
00:45:01,495 --> 00:45:06,375
What? So now you're a killer?
Like your hero?

330
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:08,878
Jhon!

331
00:45:09,921 --> 00:45:12,298
I know you! Get that shit out...

332
00:46:08,646 --> 00:46:11,148
- Boss, I did what you asked.
- Show me.

333
00:46:12,108 --> 00:46:14,235
But I have bad news.

334
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,362
- What happened?
- Look.

335
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:26,747
It's rotten, sir.

336
00:46:37,508 --> 00:46:41,637
There was half a million dollars
in that fucking case.

337
00:46:50,688 --> 00:46:53,691
This is what I could retrieve, sir.

338
00:46:53,816 --> 00:46:56,360
There's about six thousand dollars
I counted, boss.

339
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:09,957
Get your things. We're leaving.

340
00:47:12,168 --> 00:47:14,587
Remember, you and I
are partners in all this.

341
00:47:14,712 --> 00:47:18,883
<i>Everything's set.
We have to do this tonight.</i>

342
00:47:19,008 --> 00:47:20,009
Where?

343
00:47:20,134 --> 00:47:22,261
It's a safe house in El Poblado.

344
00:47:23,137 --> 00:47:24,221
We've used it before.

345
00:47:25,306 --> 00:47:26,932
<i>Berna knows Where.</i>

346
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,143
<i>I'll see you there.</i>

347
00:47:47,495 --> 00:47:49,955
Everything is ready, Judy. Get in.

348
00:47:51,415 --> 00:47:52,917
Let's go, Flaco.

349
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,601
I know what you're thinking.

350
00:48:13,479 --> 00:48:15,898
I'm making a mistake.

351
00:48:17,983 --> 00:48:21,821
You'll be taken care of
like you've taken care of me.

352
00:48:21,946 --> 00:48:25,366
The only thing that needs to happen
is to get rid of the Cali cartel.

353
00:48:25,491 --> 00:48:26,659
Up here, Flaco.

354
00:48:40,965 --> 00:48:43,426
I can't protect a rat.

355
00:49:00,943 --> 00:49:04,071
I didn't think you'd betray me.

356
00:49:05,281 --> 00:49:07,658
You were going to get yourself killed,
Judy.

357
00:49:08,784 --> 00:49:11,287
So now, you're going
to get on that plane.

358
00:49:11,412 --> 00:49:14,290
And if I don't, what?
What happens?

359
00:49:14,415 --> 00:49:17,334
If you don't get on,
then you'll leave with the Castaños.

360
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,503
And I won't protect you anymore.

361
00:49:50,868 --> 00:49:52,411
Tell me something.

362
00:49:53,662 --> 00:49:55,623
Did Cali arrange this?

363
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:00,544
How much did they offer you?
At least tell me that.

364
00:50:00,669 --> 00:50:04,673
It's a mutual understanding.
I'll work with the Castaños.

365
00:50:05,716 --> 00:50:07,593
They don't understand our business,

366
00:50:07,718 --> 00:50:11,764
- but they'll be useful in mine.
- So you fucked over your partner.

367
00:50:11,889 --> 00:50:14,099
I was never your partner.

368
00:50:14,808 --> 00:50:17,269
I only protected your life.

369
00:50:18,354 --> 00:50:22,858
Relax. You'll have money.

370
00:50:22,983 --> 00:50:26,195
The Americans said they'd make sure
you had everything you need.

371
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:30,032
- Where am I going?
- Doesn't matter.

372
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:35,579
Go. And never come back to Colombia.

373
00:50:42,044 --> 00:50:43,796
Don't worry about a thing.

374
00:50:44,505 --> 00:50:50,177
You'll still be a rat, but for the CIA,
instead of the DEA.

375
00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:45,621
Tata?

376
00:54:50,751 --> 00:54:52,461
Tata, can you hear me?

377
00:54:53,253 --> 00:54:54,588
<i>Pablo?</i>

378
00:54:57,341 --> 00:54:59,009
It's me, my love.

379
00:54:59,968 --> 00:55:02,554
<i>Finally, I can speak to you, my love.</i>

380
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:04,932
<i>I've missed you so much.</i>

381
00:55:05,057 --> 00:55:07,059
<i>Where have you been, Pablo?</i>

382
00:55:10,395 --> 00:55:13,148
I had to do something very important.

383
00:55:17,152 --> 00:55:19,571
But I'm back home, my love.

384
00:55:22,699 --> 00:55:24,701
I'm home.
