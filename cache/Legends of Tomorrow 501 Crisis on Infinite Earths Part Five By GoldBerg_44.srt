- At the Dawn of Time.

Ah!

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,710
Well, look who's finally...

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,530
Ah!

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,800
- Awake.
- Alex.

00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,450
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,890
No, no, no, it's okay. It's okay.

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,320
Are you okay? Did you have a bad dream?

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,760
I don't know. I'm...

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,020
How did I get here?

11
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,550
Well, you fell asleep
in front of the TV,

12
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,200
and you just looked so peaceful,

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,330
so I didn't have the heart
to move you to the bed.

watching before you nodded off?

Wait. What is...

18
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,170
This isn't right.

Well, I mean, it's
right, but it's not right

- because it's right.
- Uh-huh.

I see the White Martian did
a number on you last night.

00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,410
Could you maybe help me interpret it?

50
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,110
What happened?

51
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,730
Oh, uh, the world ended,
but, like, all the worlds.

52

All of them.

That's dramatic even for us.

I suppose that's why people
love superheroes so much.

I can't leap tall
buildings in a single bound,

but I have dedicated my life to fighting

on the side of humanity,
and to be recognized for that

is more than I can put into words,

was Lex doing up there?

Well, they keep throwing
all these awards at him.

He doesn't usually
accept them in person,

88

but this one meant a lot to him.

He's the best guy.

No, he's not. He's a

What? No, he's the boss.

94
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,130
And he's your number one supporter.

I mean, besides Lena.

Uh, portaling to this
location on your orders.

You don't remember coming
here for trivia night

179
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,040
and being teleported to
an alternate Waverider

180
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,990
to stop the multiverse
from being destroyed?

181
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,720
Wait, was there a crossover?

Were we invited? Did we win?

That's certainly how it looks.

184

It's good to see you're both safe.

186

from Supergirl's Earth?

Of course I know J'onn.

190
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,590
Supergirl has her own Earth?

191
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,290
Not anymore.

192
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,550
When we restarted the
universe, our worlds combined,

193
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,160
and only we Paragons know
it was ever any different.

Okay, sorry, guy, I'm
a little lost here.

195
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,980
Here, this'll be faster.

196
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,220
Whoa, there was a multiverse.

197
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,390
It all got destroyed.

198
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,440
There's an evil Batman,

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,200
and there's a me that's a super me?

200
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,420
It'll take him some time

201
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,010
to assimilate to this new paradigm.

Martian J'onn came by

230
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,490
Look, we all... we all died,

231

the entire universe, the multiverse.

232
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,490
Now we're back

233
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,370
that means, Oliver,
he might be back too.

234
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,980
After the brain dump...

235
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,330
We had Felicity run a global search.

236
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,640
I mean, nobody's better
at finding people,

237
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,080

Look, when Oliver died,
he became something else.

240
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,830
He... he called it the Spectre.

241
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,620
Then maybe, Felicity, she just
can't find him in that form.

yourselves into a giant Beebo

323
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,660
to fight a time demon.

324
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,970
I guess it's not a long story.

325
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,020
Could that be what's happening here?

326
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,330
Ava, Nate, you there?

327
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,520
I need a twenty on Behrad and his totem.

328
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,050
Sara, are you okay?

329
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,560
Ray called us to tell us you
were on some special mission.

330
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,690
But he's a little flimsy with the deets,

331
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,080
so what's the haps, Cap?

332
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,490
Yeah, we've been busy
saving the multiverse.

333
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,940
You got shanghaied into
another crossover, didn't you?

334
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,070
Hmm, yeah, kind of.

335
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,380
Whoa, whoa. Did they kidnap you?

336
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,020
This is a classic crossover move.

337
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,440
We tell 'em we're too
busy, they commit a felony.

338
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,710
Guys, Beebo is rampaging
through Star City.

339
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,110
Does Behrad have his totem?

340
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,850
Beebo? That doesn't make any sense.

341
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,590
You would need all six
totems to make that happen,

342
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,110
and Behrad's definitely
still on the ship.

343
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,110
All right, I gotta go.

344
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,190

345
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,400
No, stay in DC.

346
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,400
I don't want any more of my people

347
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,070

00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,510
Well, here's the thing.

349
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,990
One of us is kind of already there.

350
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,520

351
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,210
And who should I make this out to?

352

00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,890
How'd you find me?

485
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,640
You feel that gust of
wind a few seconds ago?

486
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,820
That was me.

487
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,920
I did a quick search of
the whole city for you.

488
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,090
When you didn't come back for
the post-Beebo celebration,

489
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,310
I got a little worried.

490
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,480
Yeah.

491
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,310
<font color="#ff00ff">[SIGHS]</font>

492
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,090
See that tree over there?

493
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,360
My sister and I, we
used to race to the top

494
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,580
when we were little.

495
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,320
I'd win every time.

496
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,930
I used to think it was
because I was a better climber,

497
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:38,330
but now I think Laurel let me win

498
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,290
'cause she knew I was a sore loser.

499
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,250
A lot has changed since then.

500
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,470
I was an assassin. <font color="#ff00ff">[CHUCKLES]</font>

501
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:54,560
I was dead, now I'm the
captain of a friggin' time ship.

502
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,820
One thing remains the same.
I'm still a sore loser.

503
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,830
<font color="#ff00ff">[SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC]</font>

504
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,220
I know it's... it's hard

505
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,530
not having Oliver here with us.

506
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,060
But look at what his
sacrifice made possible.

507
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,230
Our world is... it's different...

508
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,840
But at least it's safe.

509
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,930
<font color="#ffff00">♪</font>

510
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,420
He was just the last tether
to my old life, you know?

511
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,550
And he was the only
person left who knew me

512
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,430
when I was just... me.

513
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,840
With him gone, my
connection to this world,

514
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,540
this place, to that tree...

515
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,660
It's gone.

516
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,660
I know what it's like to lose family.

517
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,410
My mom, my dad,

518
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,500
each death felt like

519
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,630
there was no moving forward, like life

520
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,590
- would never be the same.
- Yeah.

521
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,030
And I was right it's not the same,

522
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:14,380
but... somehow it's okay.

523
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,820
Family isn't just the
people that you grew up with.

524
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,300
It's the people you
find, the ones you love,

525
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,870
ones that make you crazy...

526
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,570
Make you smile.

527
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,570
When did you get so wise?

528
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,010
The Legends, they are my family.

529
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,060
They have been for a while.

530
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:43,280
I guess I just... I always
thought there would be

531
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,590
at least someone who
remembered what I was like

532
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,460
before I got on that boat.

Barry, Sara, the shadow demons are back.

541

All right, Barry, J'onn,
Supergirl, and Batlady

556
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,730
are gathering the troops.

557
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,950
Those attacks were probably
just the first wave.

558
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,380
Assassins sent to pick us off in pairs.

559
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,600
How are the shadow
demons even still here?

560
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,610
Didn't Oliver destroy
the guy who controls them?

561
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,130
Well, not according to the surge

562
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,130
in antimatter energy I'm reading.

563
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,000
The Anti-Monitor is alive?

564
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,660
But you said Oliver sacrificed himself

565
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,360
to create this new world.

566
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,350
Apparently, his sacrifice
didn't kill the Anti-Monitor.

567
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,100
Well, then how do we do that?

568
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,540
Well, let's just throw him into the sun

569
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,360
and let the bastard burn.

570
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,890
Oh yeah, let's throw him in the sun

571
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,930
and cause an antimatter explosion

572
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,410
that obliterates the solar system.

573
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,740
You know what, let's not do that.

574
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,590
At least he's trying
to offer up a solution

575
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,640
instead of being the
cause of the problem.

576
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,680
That's the solution?
Blow up the solar system?

577
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,560
Guys, guys, we're all
on the same team, okay?

578
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,460
No, Scrappy's right.

579
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,040
It's my fault we're in this mess.

580
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,000
We gotta fix it. Gotta fix it.

581
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,950
It's just a little tricky.

582
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,350
The Anti-Monitor is made of antimatter,

583
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,570
and, like its opposite,

584
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,180
it can neither be created nor destroyed.

585
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,610
It can only...

586
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,270
Change form and move
from place to place.

587
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,400
So what if we do just that?

588
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,580
What if we could set
off a chain reaction

589
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,970
that will destabilize his form?

590
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,430
Compressing his molecules
so he's essentially

591
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,230
shrinking for eternity.

592
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,930
Is that kind of reaction even possible?

593
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,920
Sure it is.

594
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,500
I did it a bunch of times by accident

595
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,280
when I was developing my ATOM exosuit.

596
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,190
So you think you can keep
him shrinking indefinitely?

597
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,030
Essentially, we'd be sending
him to the "Atomverse".

598
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,980
I like to call it the Microverse.

599
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,300
Ah, that's better.

600
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,030
Possible trademark
issues, but that's better.

601
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,640
He could get stuck
there for, like, ever.

602
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,430
In theory it could totally work.

603
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,600
But developing a device in time...

604
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,080
Leave that to me, D-League.

605
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,480
I just gotta get to STAR Labs. Scrappy.

606
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,780
Look, if this goes down
anything like it did

607
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:27,830
on Earth-38, then things
are gonna get messy.

608
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,180
Geek team, get on it.

609
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,530
Mick, go with 'em, keep 'em safe.

610
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,490
The rest of us, we'll need to
hold back this incoming army.

back at the Dawn of Time.

as the first of our heroes,

00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,560
and while this is a devastating loss,

786
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,990
we can take solace in knowing

787
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,650

And finally, the darkness broke,

804
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,270
filling it with life...

805
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,540
<font color="#ffff00">♪</font>

806
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,410
With the multiverse.

807
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,630
<font color="#ffff00">♪</font>

808
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,060


809
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,290
Every existence
multiplied by possibility.

810
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:51,770
And spread out before space
and time in infinite measure.

811
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,190
<font color="#ffff00">♪</font>

812
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,470


813
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,920
Civilizations rose and fell...

814
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,650


815
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:07,020
And rose again across
reality's grasping expanse.

816
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,970


817
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,450
Life, a precious gift, persevering

818
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,820
in the face of every obstacle...

819
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,900


820
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:29,750
Until, finally,

821
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,230
- 
- the age of heroes was born.

822
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,380
Thanks for saving us, Oliver.

823
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,080
The world has hope again.

824
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,000
I have hope again.

825
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,620
We'll never forget you.

00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,790
Thanks for believing in
me even when I didn't.

829
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,100
You had this way of bringing
out the very best in all of us.

830
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,770
I'm gonna miss you, man.

831
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,570
I've lost a lot of people that I love.

832
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,540
But I never imagined my
life without you in it.

833
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,760
You were always there for me.

834
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,240
And now...

835
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:42,280
Ollie, you changed my
fate for the better.

836
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,550
Thank you.

837

<font color="#ffff00">♪</font>

838
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,590
I never met Oliver, but he
must have been a good dude.

839
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,400
But why'd you choose
a condemned building?

840
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,750
What?

841
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,060
No, this is not a condemned building.

842
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,670
No, listen, this is an old
STAR Labs Research Facility

843
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,630
that nobody uses, and
what's even better,

844
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,680
no one knows it exists.

845
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,160
- Good for you.
- No, good for us.

846
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:46,250
I figure we could all use this to gather

847
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,110
if anything ever happens again.

848
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,410
It's a great idea, Barry.

849
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,370
Thanks, Superman.

850
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,230
It's a better option than
you all dropping by the DEO.

851
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,620
Why do we even need it?

852
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,100
I mean, how often does the world

853

almost come to an end? <font color="#ff00ff">[CHUCKLES]</font>

Oh, it's like that.

855
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,690
Don't worry, I was
the new kid last year.

856
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,300
All right, listen, I
haven't even shown you guys

857
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,300
the best part yet. You ready?

You should have led with that, bro.

862
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,820
Yeah.

863
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,480
- Not bad.
- I love it.

864
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,240
It's perfect.
