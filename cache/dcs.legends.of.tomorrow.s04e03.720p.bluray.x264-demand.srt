<i>Previously on</i>
Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,560
Hello.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,472
Mallus wasn't the only
prisoner to escape.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,789
And now, there's magic.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,749
Oh, my God!

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,880
<i>An unknown number of
dangerous magical beings</i>

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,515
got spat out across the timeline
and now must be sent to hell.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,520
Going somewhere, Raymond?

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,950
You think it's Nora.

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,753
<i>And if the Time Bureau
finds her first,</i>

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,160
<i>she's gonna tell them you're the one
who helped her escape.</i>

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,156
Ma'am, your crown jewels are here.

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,434
There's absolutely
no reason to worry.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,354
All is in order.

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,550
Excellent.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,837
I shall wear them out,
so my people can adore their queen.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,229
Yes, of course, ma'am.

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,039
And will you be waving from
the north balcony or the south?

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,680
I was thinking
something a little more intimate.

20
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,879
<i>God save the queen</i>

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,197
<i>A fascist regime</i>

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,040
<i>They made you a moron</i>

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,518
<i>Potential H-bomb</i>

24
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,755
Wow. Red beans and rice
didn't miss Her Majesty.

25
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,073
Now I understand
how Mr. Mix-a-Lot got his knighthood.

26
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,496
- Sir... Sir...
- Sir... Sir...

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,512
Guys, guys.
A little professionalism, please.

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,536
What kind of ripple effect
are we really looking at here, Nate?

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,871
Okay. Right now,
the Queen gets institutionalized,

30
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,637
the British monarchy fails,
and England descends into chaos.

31
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,120
Anarchy in the U.K.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,476
Which is weird, but paranormal?

33
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,349
Well, something freaky
is definitely at the heart of this.

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,235
Our magic-tracking device
detected a massive spike.

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,593
All right, then we got a live one.

36
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,036
Punk rock London. Nate, you ready?

37
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,960
Um...

38
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:19,521
Well, Ava asked me to stick around

39
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,990
and help launch
the magic operations here.

40
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,318
We need to establish procedure,
protocols, command structure...

41
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,030
So, desk job?

42
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,551
Nate Heywood, cubicle guy?

43
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,393
Sad little plant on his desk, really?

44
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,914
It's prestigious, Sara.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,798
And then,
when everything's up and running,

46
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,553
I come back to the <i>Waverider.</i>

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,676
Fine.

48
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,000
Cool kids are off to the jolly ol'.

49
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,560
Wow. This is very sleek.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,040
Ah. Handles all your messaging and data,
it keeps accurate time in any era,

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,156
and it counts your steps.

52
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,720
Which, to me,
is a little overrated...

53
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,638
And it also contains the Air Totem.

54
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,040
Thanks, Ray. I love it.

55
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,550
Well, you are actually
the one I should be thanking.

56
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,560
I feel like you're the only one I can
talk to about this whole Nora thing.

57
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,149
Your secret's safe with me.

58
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,672
Doing bad things for good reasons
is practically our mission statement.

59
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,435
Even Amaya did it.

60
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,910
Yeah, but, uh, this is
kind of complicated.

61
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,673
The others can handle complicated.

62
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,356
Maybe.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,038
- And then there were five.
- Shorter bathroom lines.

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah, but no one to watch
Patrick Swayze movies with.

65
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,119
Nate will be back soon.
In the meantime,

66
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,159
we need to go back
before the monarchy goes anarchy.

67
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,477
Never thought
I'd get to meet the Queen.

68
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,755
Not gonna happen.

69
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,157
Too risky. And besides,

70
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,472
she's not the one
setting off Ray's magicometer.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,516
The Queen's favorite new band
is The Smell.

72
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,110
The Smell?

73
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,376
Never heard of them,
and I know of every

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,232
rubbish punk band there is in London.

75
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,960
That's because
they didn't exist in this timeline.

76
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,076
Gideon.

77
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,198
<i>The Queen's cheekyjig
launched The Smell's rise to stardom.</i>

78
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,776
<i>They were known as much
for their music</i>

79
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,679
<i>as for a series of improbable
anti-establishment pranks.</i>

80
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,319
All with a magical signature.

81
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,240
Okay, so we're looking
for someone in the band.

82
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,272
We could be dealing
with demonic possession,

83
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,079
mind control, illusion,

84
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,279
or maybe just a run-of-the-mill
royal dementia.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,036
Hold on a minute.

86
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,917
There's your magic man right there.

87
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,595
Obsessed with riches,
given to mischief...

88
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,797
That Irishman there is a leprechaun.

89
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,670
So... So sorry.
Are, are you being serious or racist?

90
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,634
- Both, love.
- Why is the weasel running the show?

91
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,238
If you've got a problem with me,
pie head, why don't you just say?

92
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,829
I got a problem with you.

93
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,874
I'm running it, and I say
we need to get close to that band,

94
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,256
which shouldn't be a problem,

95
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,272
'cause everybody
left on this ship is a punk.

96
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,555
Except for Haircut.

97
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,678
He hasn't broken a rule in his life.

98
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,475
Yep. Not a single rule.

99
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:04,991
The Hole. Cradle of punk rock

100
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,390
and the stickiest floor
in the British Isles.

101
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,312
Sounds lovely. You kids have fun.

102
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,640
I'll have a bottle of hand sanitizer
when you come back.

103
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,479
You gotta love that sound.

104
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,594
- What?
- The music.

105
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,353
It's the dog's bollocks.

106
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,512
Sorry, I can't hear you
over the terrible music.

107
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,954
We're The Smell,
and you're a bunch of mingers.

108
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,997
And we'll be back up
when we feel like it!

109
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,136
All right, guys.
Here's our chance.

110
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,358
Somebody's got to slip backstage
and get in with the bands.

111
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,280
Yeah, leave it to me. I used to
play here with Mucous Membrane.

112
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,159
I know my way around.
Besides, you're all bloody Yanks.

113
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,880
- Not you.
- Why not?

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,116
I don't like him.

115
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,352
It's always Perfidious Albion, is it?
Never trust a Brit?

116
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Something like that.

117
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,318
Guys, really,
we don't have time for this.

118
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,551
Somehow, Mr. Rory here
hasn't realized

119
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,553
that if he's gonna play with fire,
he's gonna get burned.

120
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,956
Don't...

121
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,635
Fight!

122
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,152
<i>Clouds...</i>

123
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,959
<i>...like we're close together...</i>

124
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,310
Oi! You lot.

125
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,120
<i>Building castles in air</i>

126
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,675
- Thanks for the lift, mate.
- Get us out of here!

127
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,797
Come on! Go! Let's go!

128
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,199
Oh, let me out, I'm gonna puke.

129
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:10,401
Don't let the suit fool you.
Our man is a punk.

130
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,016
He drove on
the wrong side of the road

131
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,394
- the whole way here.
- I did?

132
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:15,441
Nice.

133
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,350
See you around, mate.

134
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,998
All right, Sara.
I found their hideout.

135
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,600
Heading back to the <i>Waverider.</i>

136
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,480
No, Ray.
You are our guy on the inside.

137
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,870
<i>Look, loud music
makes my nose bleed.</i>

138
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,758
I... I'm not a punk.

139
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,231
<i>Well, you are now.
You stay with that band.</i>

140
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,656
<i>Ray. Ray, are you there?</i>

141
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,280
Aah. You're pressing
the button too hard.

142
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,632
All right, yeah. It's my first time.
Listen, mate.

143
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,957
<i>There's an old trick
for unmasking leprechauns.</i>

144
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,509
You spill a bunch of grain
in front of them on the floor,

145
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,637
and they're compelled
to count every kernel.

146
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,915
Really? That sounds bizarre.
That's not true.

147
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,876
- Is that true?
- That's a stupid plan.

148
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,714
Have you got a better one, big man?

149
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,995
I don't do magic tricks.

150
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,316
Oh, great. So the plan is no plan.
Is that you...

151
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,160
- Enough! Both of you.
- You know what?

152
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,360
It is 1977 in London town.
I'm gonna enjoy the sights.

153
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,239
Good luck with your magic problem.

154
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,715
Did you guys just
make Constantine leave?

155
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,360
We'll get back to you, Ray.

156
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,669
- Not your finest work, bud.
- He's gonna get us killed.

157
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,717
You just don't like guys with ties.

158
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,176
That's right. It's like a little flag
hanging from someone's neck

159
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,429
saying, "I'm a liar."

160
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,477
Look, I'll have
Zari follow him, all right?

161
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,950
But in the meantime,

162
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,096
you and I need to help Ray
find this magical creature,

163
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,874
so we can send it to hell
before this whole team falls apart.

164
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,838
- How's it going?
- Good.

165
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,956
Great.

166
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,160
All right.
This should be all of it.

167
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,830
These protocols were developed by Rip
and myself over the last six years.

168
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,997
- I did the drawings.
- Thank you, Gary.

169
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,754
So, your job is to just update

170
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,349
all of this for our new,
uh, magical fugitives, okay?

171
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,999
You got it, boss.

172
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,198
And as we say at the Time Bureau,
the adventure is in the details.

173
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
Have fun.

174
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
You okay?

175
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,560
Um...

176
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:06,711
I'm good. I'm good.

177
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,696
It's just... I know you guys
do things differently here.

178
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,757
I just didn't know
it was so protocol-centric.

179
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,356
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

180
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,400
Look, I know you're used to
zooming around in a time machine...

181
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,896
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...with all your best friends,

182
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,673
shooting from the hip
and saving history.

183
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,395
- Always.
- But, you know,

184
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,917
the Bureau's not all protocols.

185
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,270
I'm listening.

186
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
Come with.

187
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,436
Buckle up, Nate. It's Taco Monday.

188
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,830
Instead of Taco Tuesday?

189
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,240
Oh, we dare to defy.

190
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,754
- Whoa.
- Taco delivery.

191
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,672
Are you Mr. Green?

192
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,076
Oh, name's Gary.

193
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,039
Mr. Green's in the conservatory
with the lead pipe.

194
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,600
- Sorry. Bad joke.
- No, that was great.

195
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,990
Um... Yeah.

196
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,480
My name is Mona, by the way.

197
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,600
Just kind of like <i>Mona Lisa</i>
without the Lisa, so it's just Mona.

198
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Cool.

199
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,834
Time Bureau. Ah.
Is that what this place is?

200
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,556
You know, they just never tell us.
What's a Time Bureau?

201
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,396
Uh... Um...

202
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,359
You know, like, daylight savings
and time zones and stuff like that?

203
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,476
We're in charge of that.

204
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,914
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

205
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,359
It's actually just one...

206
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,439
- Uh-oh.
- One per person.

207
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,994
Okay, bye.

208
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,316
Okay.

209
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,551
Shh. Got it. Yeah.

210
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,713
What, did we forgot something
in the van?

211
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,632
No, I... Seeing as, um, I drove you guys
and you didn't pay me,

212
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,696
Uh, I thought maybe I could hang out
with you...

213
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,880
...blokes.

214
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,400
Down with the monarchy, right?

215
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,915
I didn't catch your name.

216
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,358
Rage.

217
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,949
- Rage?
- Yep, Rage. That's what they call me.

218
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,754
On account of all my various
rages, uh, against, um, the machine.

219
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,030
Oh.

220
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,077
I'd like to see some rage, Rage.

221
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,117
I'm Charlie. Come on in.

222
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
Ha.

223
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,353
Guys, do you remember our driver?

224
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,036
Well, he goes by the name Rage,
because of his wicked rages.

225
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,072
Yeah? About what?

226
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
Oh.

227
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,079
Disco music, right?

228
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,200
The Queen, obviously.

229
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,830
Doing chores in a timely fashion.

230
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,630
- We hate disco too.
- Yeah, hate disco. Hate it.

231
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,236
I had to move from New York
just to get away from

232
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,352
tight trousers
and platform shoes.

233
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,160
Do you know how hard it is
to walk in those?

234
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,954
- All right. Let's hear a rage then.
- Yeah, go on.

235
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,271
At this hour?
No, I don't like to force them.

236
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,592
You know, just let them
come naturally, but it'll happen.

237
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,912
What about you guys? You know, uh...

238
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,351
- What makes you tick?
- We're The Smell.

239
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,069
We're a band.
What more is there to say?

240
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,880
We're a bit more than that, Declan.

241
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,430
We're a movement.

242
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,155
We're gonna shock the system,
wake up all the drones.

243
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,674
Yeah, present company included.

244
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,640
Oh. Oh!

245
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,478
Sorry, I got rice everywhere.
Sorry. You see that, Declan?

246
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
What?

247
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,196
The rice... The grains of rice,
they are everywhere.

248
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,240
I'm sorry if you feel the urge to
have to pick up every single piece.

249
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,638
Mate, are you trying
the leprechaun test on me?

250
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,798
You know how hurtful
you're being right now? Deeply!

251
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,196
Declan's a bit touchy
about being ginger.

252
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,840
- You're all right, Rage.
- Well, Rage has got to leave.

253
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,437
We've got to plan
Operation Mum's Bum.

254
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,555
Mum's Bum. Mum-Mum's Bum? Hey.

255
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,240
Sounds fun. I could get into that.

256
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,755
Oh, we could use a driver.

257
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,039
- Can we trust him?
- There's only one way to find out.

258
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,920
So, that's the big highlight?

259
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,760
Eating tacos one day before
the rest of America?

260
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,320
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

261
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,680
Oh. Hey, there's a blip
on the magicometer.

262
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,117
It's from the Pleistocene period.

263
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,114
Clear your schedule.

264
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,519
We've got a report to write.

265
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,000
Or, or, or...

266
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,955
Or we can handle this ourselves.

267
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,189
Without approval?
That sounds dangerous.

268
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,393
You've got two, but I'm sort of
down to my last nipple.

269
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,120
Gary, Ava hired me
to optimize this department, okay,

270
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,238
and I can't do that
waiting three days for approval.

271
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,590
And we could be time bros.

272
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,709
- What?
- We could be time bros.

273
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,629
- Time bros?
- Yeah.

274
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,235
- Me and you?
- Mmm-hmm.

275
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,476
- Oh, but, um...
- We could re-heat your tacos later.

276
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,555
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah.

277
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,995
- This way.
- Okay.

278
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,309
Okay. Here we are.

279
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,349
Uh... Where are we?

280
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,078
St James's Park,
next to Buckingham Palace.

281
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,119
St James's Park, you say?

282
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,554
All right, Ray, we're listening.

283
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,714
The Queen's royal corgis are taking
their afternoon constitutional.

284
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,576
You're gonna nab
one of those little yippers

285
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,670
and bring him back to us.

286
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,096
Uh... We-we're not gonna
hurt the dog, are we?

287
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,032
No, we're gonna hurt the Queen.

288
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,080
She treats her dogs
to beef Wellington

289
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,560
while poor people are starving.

290
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,154
It's time to expose the hypocrisy.

291
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,597
Okay, yeah. No problem. Dogs love me.

292
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,750
<i>Yes. Problem.</i>

293
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,880
They're the Queen's dogs.
They are gonna be guarded.

294
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,635
Question. Will the dogs
be heavily guarded?

295
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,434
Well, that's your problem.

296
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,920
It's time to see how far you'll go.

297
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,471
If you've got a rage stored up,
now is the time.

298
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,709
It's...

299
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,877
Ray, we can hear you
gulping through the comms.

300
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,077
Do we really have to do this?

301
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,117
I mean, we know that
Declan's not a leprechaun.

302
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,237
Well, your machine says
one of them is magical,

303
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,835
so our job is to find them
and get it gone.

304
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,351
<i>You're gonna have to do this
the old-fashioned way.</i>

305
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
Corgi-napping?

306
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,671
Gaining their trust
and betraying them.

307
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,279
We'll help you out with the corgis.

308
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,592
- QB or wet work?
- QB.

309
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,431
<i>Ray, Rory's gonna
walk you through this one.</i>

310
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,159
<i>Easy-peasy lemon squeezy.</i>

311
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,480
Oh. I see them.

312
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,319
Let's go, pups.
Pup-and-at-'em, Sparky.

313
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,240
You see that bench in front of you?

314
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,800
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Sit on it.

315
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
<i>Okay.</i>

316
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,757
All right, Ray. I feel like
I should do, uh, something like, uh...

317
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,071
- Maybe a distraction?
- Just wait.

318
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,670
This would go a lot faster
if you'd just do your thing, Gordon.

319
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,072
Can we just nick his van already?

320
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,754
That's why we're here, innit?

321
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,990
Give him a minute.

322
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,201
Mick, you were right.
It's just the dog walker now.

323
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,034
Go and ask for the corgi.

324
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,675
Ah. Excuse me, sir.

325
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,956
I, uh... I don't know
if this is royal etiquette,

326
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,874
but if it may please the Crown,

327
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,871
may I, uh, borrow one of those corgis?

328
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,116
Just take him.

329
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,760
Oh.

330
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:13,841
There are those famous
British manners I've heard of.

331
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,990
Thank you.

332
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,720
Good choice.

333
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,480
Well, how long do you think
the poor lad is gonna last in the clink?

334
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,910
Blimey.

335
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,040
My word! That young man's
stolen a royal corgi!

336
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,591
He did it. He bloody did it.

337
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,836
Go on, roll up, Declan!

338
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,594
Go, go, go, go, go!

339
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,429
<i>We start off the hour with an update
of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth's</i>

340
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,113
<i>beloved corgi, Sparky.</i>

341
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,193
<i>Reported missing
earlier this afternoon,</i>

342
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,192
<i>he has finally been found behind bars</i>

343
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,520

animal rescue for dogs.</i>

344
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,793
<i>From the looks of it, the pooch
has fallen in with a bad crowd.</i>

345
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,672
<i>Well, at least someone
from Buckingham Palace</i>

346
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,880
<i>has glimpsed the real world.</i>

347
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,077
Rage! Rage! Rage!

348
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,836
- To the table!
- Oh! Snacks! I'm famished!

349
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,351
- It'll only hurt for a minute, love.
- Hurt?

350
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,216
- A tattoo.
- Yeah, we all have them.

351
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,674
Get them after our first prank.

352
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,194
It's a Smell tradition.

353
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,397
Once you get one,
you're one of us, mate.

354
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,350
Oh, that needle's
been sterilized, right?

355
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,511
See, Charlie, told ya. He's a narc.

356
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,797
No, he just doesn't get it.

357
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,357
This isn't a tattoo.
It's a statement.

358
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,514
That ink says you won't swallow
the crap they force down our throats.

359
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,470
Sometimes you have to do bad things
for good reasons.

360
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,676
So what do you say? You in?

361
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,192
Yeah, I'm in.

362
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,476
Give me the tattoo.

363
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Yeah.

364
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,236
Now that you're officially one of us,
the corgi was just for a laugh.

365
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,960
We're gonna make the Queen
hand over her precious jewels.

366
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,431
Yeah. Uh... Just one question. How?

367
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,473
Leave that part to me.
I'll work my magic.

368
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,790
Another pint?

369
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,350
I'd love one.

370
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,000
You should probably have something
in your stomach with this one.

371
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,113
Aren't you kind, looking after me?

372
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,876
I try my best.

373
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,278
Did he tell you he's a dark soul,
cursed to walk the world alone?

374
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Something like that.

375
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,870
I'll be right back.

376
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,076
Thanks, love.

377
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,994
How the bloody hell did you find me
up here in Liverpool, eh?

378
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,956
Sara had me
install a tracker in your comm.

379
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Ah.

380
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,392
No one trusts old Johnny boy.

381
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,799
Can't say I blame you lot.

382
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,353
Yeah, she had a hunch

383
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,350
your baser instincts
would pull you off-mission.

384
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,400
Ah, she'd be the one to bloody know,
wouldn't she?

385
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,800
- Here you are, love.
- Thanks.

386
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,713
Just give me a shout
if you want a water.

387
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,876
Will do.

388
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,269
That brooding antihero crap
must be a real panty-dropper. Huh?

389
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,275
You tell her you have four roommates
and sleep on the couch?

390
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,840
No, I didn't.

391
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
She's my mum.

392
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,954
I'm really wishing
I had not said "panty-dropper."

393
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
Yep.

394
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
Oh.

395
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,110
Feels so good
to be back in the field.

396
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,360
Feel that cool Pleistocene breeze
in our hair.

397
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,033
The only thing is I do feel a little
naked without a clever costume on.

398
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,194
Oh, I'm sort off of costumes
right now.

399
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,000
Oh, 'cause of your, uh, John Cosplay?

400
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,160
What's going on with you two anyway?

401
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,870
Well, he dropped me, which sucks.

402
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,674
I mean, you know.

403
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,590
Why would you say that?

404
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,474
Oh, there's no shame in it.

405
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,796
You know, I used to just think
of you as Amaya's arm-candy,

406
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,112
so it's nice to know you're
more than just the guy Amaya dumped.

407
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,715
She didn't dump me.
We broke up to save the timeline.

408
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,315
Yeah, Constantine
let me down easy too.

409
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,597
Said it was about
the balance of good and evil.

410
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,240
Wait. Did she dump me?

411
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,074
Well, all I know is that she started
a family with another guy, real fast.

412
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,629
You tell me. But, hey, hey.

413
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,314
You get back out there.

414
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,517
Meet some new people,
change up your scenery a bit...

415
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,990
- Hide.
- Hide if it heals your heart better.

416
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,196
Shut up. Hide!

417
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,136
- Quitting time.
- Yo, shut that off.

418
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,276
You're gonna get us killed.

419
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,856
If we don't get back to the office,
Director Sharpe is gonna kill us.

420
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,394
She hates overtime.

421
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,795
- You're kidding.
- No!

422
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,669
- On three.
- Yes.

423
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,672
- One, two...
- One, two...

424
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,155
- Three. Go.
- Uh...

425
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,320
Gary, go on!

426
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,719
Psst. It's me, Ray.
Look straight ahead.

427
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,200
Talk straight into your newspaper.

428
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,714
No one will suspect a thing.

429
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,390
What do you got on them?

430
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,159
Gilly loves monkeys,

431
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,159
Ian's first language was Yiddish,

432
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,280
and Declan, his nose crinkles
when he smiles.

433
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,376
- It's actually pretty cute.
- I don't want to date them, Haircut,

434
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,960
just tell me which one
I'll have to off.

435
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,638
Well, it appears that
Charlie is our "myth-ery"

436
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,040
or fugitive.

437
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,630
Good.

438
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,473
We'll nab her and send her to hell.

439
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,118
Hell? What...

440
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,709
Look, all she's guilty of is
questionable hygiene,

441
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,634
playing bad music,
and pulling a couple pranks.

442
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,110
We started this mess,
we gotta take care of it.

443
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,190
All right, well...

444
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,536
Just give me some time to figure out

445
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,313
what her powers are
before we move on her.

446
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,471
You've got until the weasel
gets back.

447
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,034
What the hell is that on your arm?

448
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,870
It's my tattoo.

449
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,597
It's a corgi with a mohawk.

450
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,040
You've lost it, Haircut.

451
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,910
Finally lost it.

452
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,555
It's Rage, mate.

453
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,720
Were you and your mom close?

454
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,239
Just met her 20 minutes ago.

455
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,080
Died in childbirth.

456
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,989
Two for two. Sorry.

457
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,799
My dad used to call me "Killer."

458
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,439
Never let me forget what I did.

459
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,639
- Hmm. Father of the year.
- Mmm.

460
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,920
You wouldn't guess that
to look at him, would you?

461
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,680
You didn't just happen
to run into your parents, did you?

462
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,394
I've ruined a lot of lives,

463
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,515
and that bastard's just the first one
to call me out on it.

464
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,191
Listen, if you're going to wallow
in self-pity,

465
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,431
the <i>Waverider's</i> got a lot of rooms
for that.

466
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,757
I'm partial to the kitchen myself.

467
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,992
Oh, I'm not here to wallow, love.

468
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,150
I'm here to fix it.

469
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,360
I'm gonna give him
the old Manchester Mengele.

470
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,875
- What?
- Back-alley vasectomy.

471
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,510
"Back-alley..."

472
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
No, John, you can't!

473
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,835
What happened?

474
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,195
Ball-kick paradox.

475
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,696
You can't kick your own dad
in the junk

476
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,456
because you'd erase yourself
from the timeline,

477
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,960
which means there would be
no one to kick your dad in the junk.

478
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,720
Bloody hell, I can't.

479
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,911
Toss off, you legless wanker.

480
00:23:33,561 --> 00:23:35,757
Tommy.
Tommy, are you all right?

481
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,240
Get the hell out of my pub!

482
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,280
I never wanna see your face again.

483
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,360
You won't.

484
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,912
Another cracking
Constantine family reunion.

485
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,679
Look, I get it.

486
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,151
There's a lot of things
I wish I could change.

487
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,712
But you can't mess with your past.

488
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,953
Time Travel 101.

489
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,239
It's not just my mum.

490
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,400
There are others I've hurt.

491
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
My past

492
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,589
is coming for me.

493
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,600
What do you mean?

494
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,000
You know what? Forget it!

495
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,272
Ray will be needing us now,
won't he?

496
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,472
Hello, punk friends.
Anyone seen Charlie?

497
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,554
We know what you've been up to.

498
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,280
You do? Of course you do.
I'm a terrible liar.

499
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,635
Shut it, Rage.

500
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,189
If that is your real name,
which I'm pretty sure it's not.

501
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,920
You said you left New York
to escape the disco scene.

502
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,593
Then explain this.

503
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,240
"Mystery disco band
leaves the audience saying,

504
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,800
"'Thank you for the music."'

505
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,312
Can you even name a punk song?

506
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,312
Well, I...

507
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,600
I told you idiots we couldn't
trust him. He's a narc.

508
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,672
Yeah, a disco narc.

509
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,911
Look, can we just talk
about this calmly?

510
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,190
Calmly?

511
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,954
Is this Rage chap
ever gonna have a rage or not?

512
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,437
I think we should
glue sequins all over him,

513
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,256
and string him up like a disco ball
at the Roxy.

514
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,475
Shut it!

515
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,360
Listen to yourselves.

516
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,597
You lot sound like brainwashed pigs.

517
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,111
So what?
The bloke fancies a bit of disco.

518
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,989
Gilly used to be a nun.

519
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,955
Ian was a mime.

520
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,199
I've done a stint in the lockup.

521
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,680
Declan's not even Irish.

522
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,954
I thought it sounded more street.

523
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,400
We've all got a past.

524
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,432
And it is just that, a past.

525
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,639
I don't care who you were before.

526
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,269
Whoever you wanna be now,
that's what matters.

527
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,240
Did you put butter
in the coffee machine again, Gary?

528
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,240
- Yes.
- Hey, Ava.

529
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,520
Oh.

530
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:12,875
Hey, happy Tuesday.

531
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,256
- How was your evening?
- Actually, it was nice.

532
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,316
What about you?

533
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,760
You ready to get back out there?

534
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,336
Gary told me you guys wrapped up
yesterday's mission without a hitch.

535
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,476
I am very impressed.

536
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,080
I look forward
to reading your report.

537
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,509
Good job.

538
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
We wrapped it up?

539
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,320
It wrapped itself up.

540
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,920
The blip is gone.

541
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,600
What do you mean it's gone?

542
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,672
Don't overthink it, Nate.
Take the win.

543
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,759
Oh. I got you something
to commemorate our first

544
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,230
mission together as time bros.

545
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,116
It's an exotic plant
to spruce up your work space.

546
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Looks good.

547
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,473
Mixtape.
If you're gonna be in the band,

548
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,840
you should be able to
at least name one punk song.

549
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,713
Cool. Thank you.

550
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,231
And thank you for, uh, earlier.

551
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,800
Oh, sometimes the others think
they're the damn punk police.

552
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,000
I have to tell you something.

553
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,597
My name is not really Rage.
In fact, it's nothing anger related.

554
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,156
It's Just Ray.

555
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,840
- Just Ray?
- Yeah.

556
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,316
I like that.

557
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,269
So, Just Ray,

558
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,634
what happened to your old crew?

559
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,954
Well, Sara met a special someone
and they are trying to make it work.

560
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,394
- That will kill a band.
- Mmm.

561
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,037
My best friend, Nate,
he, uh, has a desk job.

562
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,479
And Amaya, well, she's gone.

563
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,800
And I actually really miss her.

564
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,675
She was kind of our moral compass.

565
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,240
Helped us do the right thing

566
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,516
when it wasn't always easy
to do the right thing.

567
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,831
I never knew
disco could get so barmy.

568
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,272
Well, I guess the way we did it,

569
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,959
yeah, it did get pretty barmy.

570
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
So, uh...

571
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,710
How long were you locked up?

572
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,831
Long enough to know
I ain't ever going back.

573
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,236
What happened?

574
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,353
Small-minded people got scared.

575
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,435
Turned to law and order
to make themselves feel big.

576
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,749
Prison seems extreme
for a little bit of mischief.

577
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,796
I wasn't sent away
for stealing corgis.

578
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,351
Are you sure you can handle
the truth, Just Ray?

579
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,834
Yeah, try me.

580
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Whoa.

581
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,830
- This doesn't freak you out?
- No.

582
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,315
Such rapid molecular
transformation is,

583
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,437
to quote an old friend, astonishing.

584
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,111
How do you choose who to be
when you can be anybody?

585
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,115
Just saw this mug
on a toothpaste ad on the Tube.

586
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,600
I liked her smile.

587
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Huh.

588
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,200
Wow.

589
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:03,160
Must be strange to completely change.

590
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,356
It is.

591
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,477
That's why I have to hold tight
to what I believe.

592
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,995
Strong drinks, loud music,
and screwing the system.

593
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,438
Otherwise I'd lose myself.

594
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,073
You're a pretty cool lady.

595
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,870
Or man. Or whatever you wanna be.

596
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,314
I wish the humans who threw me
in the slammer felt that way.

597
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,910
They just saw a magical creature
and panicked.

598
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,669
I'm so sorry.

599
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,435
Oh, don't be.

600
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,273
You're one of the good ones,
Just Ray.

601
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,878
Sara, I figured it out.

602
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,998
All right, Ray,
what are we dealing with?

603
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,434
<i>She's a shapeshifter.</i>

604
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,160
<i>She doesn't kidnap the Queen,
she becomes the Queen.</i>

605
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,197
- I knew it.
- He definitely said leprechaun.

606
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,075
<i>So I have an idea.</i>

607
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,675
What if I just ask her to stop
impersonating the Queen?

608
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,479
History goes back to the way it was,

609
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,114
and we don't have
to send her to hell.

610
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,376
Ray, so far we've learned that

611
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,916
unicorns are homicidal maniacs
and fairy godmothers are psychopaths.

612
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,616
And they're supposed to be
the nice ones.

613
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,154
And these shapeshifting bastards,

614
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,550
they put the rest to shame.
We're talking killing sprees,

615
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,040
<i>world wars, you name it.</i>

616
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,536
Yeah, but she's not doing
any of that.

617
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,280
She's manipulating you.
Don't fall for it, mate.

618
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,317
Too late. He's got a tattoo.

619
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,233
Oh, please let it be a tramp stamp.

620
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,320
She's not hurting anyone.

621
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,631
Sit tight, Haircut.
We'll, uh, work this out.

622
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,753
<i>Thank you, Mick. Maybe we could...</i>

623
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,710
He's in too deep.

624
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,990
For once, I agree with you.

625
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,119
Ray has no bloody idea
what he's dealing with.

626
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,793
Ray has been doing this a long time.

627
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,916
He can handle himself.

628
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,072
Sara, if this thing gets loose,
there is no stopping it. Trust me.

629
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,240
Zari, what do you think?
Has the shapeshifter gotten to Ray?

630
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,796
Yeah.

631
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,070
All right, then.
Squad save the Queen.

632
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,875
That's not the plan.

633
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,112
- Do you trust me?
- Of course.

634
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,714
- You are my friend.
- We gotta go.

635
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,910
What? Why?

636
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,434
Because my friends don't trust me.

637
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,199
Ray, we just wanna talk.

638
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,792
So your disco mates
think I'll come quietly.

639
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,430
Who are you, really?

640
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,800
Look, Declan was right.
I am a narc. I'm a magic narc.

641
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,760
I was sent here to capture you
and take you in, but...

642
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,120
- You ain't sending me back to prison.
- I'm not gonna do it.

643
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,236
Haircut!

644
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,960
Then what are you gonna do?

645
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,440
You told me that you wanted
to shock people and wake them up.

646
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,515
That's what I'm gonna do
to my own team.

647
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,200
You asked me who I really am?

648
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,316
I'm a punk.

649
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,799
Come on, Ray, open the door.

650
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,200
Or we burn it down.

651
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,558
Ah, lunch is here. Yes!

652
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,150
Hey, I have an idea for you guys.

653
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,471
- Who guys?
- You guys, the Time Bureau.

654
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,760
Oh.

655
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,875
Sorry, that was supposed
to be top secret.

656
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,272
No worries, because I was thinking,

657
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,996
you know how time zones
go up and down?

658
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,390
Well, what about sideways?

659
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,914
Sideways time zones?

660
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,150
Huh? Like across?

661
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,896
So you wouldn't have
to change your clock

662
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,231
- when you took a solo...
- ...road trip across America!

663
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,518
- That's genius.
- Thanks.

664
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
What is happening?

665
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Sorry I have to do this.

666
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,319
And have a nice day.

667
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,354
Okay, you got a sandwich.

668
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,389
I got a sandwich.

669
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,153
Pro tip. Bureau pays for lunch,

670
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,550
so make sure you eat enough
so you're not hungry again

671
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,640
until tomorrow.

672
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,516
You really do know
all the boring tricks.

673
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,959
I can see you're in a funk.
Is this still about Amaya?

674
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,919
Lay it on the Gare Bear.

675
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,593
It's okay to cry. In fact...

676
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,840
It's encouraged.

677
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,200
Gary, where did you get that plant?

678
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,799
It's from our first mission together.

679
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,595
I wanted it to have
a special meaning for us.

680
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,030
Gary.

681
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,315
- Gary, it's magical.
- It is?

682
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,919
Gary, stapler!

683
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,200
Today, we ride!

684
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Yah!

685
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,834
Oh, no sign of Ray
or the creature, Captain.

686
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
Sara?

687
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
- Sara?
- Mmm.

688
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,231
Maybe you should have put a tracker
in her comm.

689
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
What the hell, Ray?

690
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,990
Come on.

691
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,596
Sara, Charlie decked me.

692
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,795
Oh, no.

693
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,276
No.

694
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,633
Sara. Sara.

695
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
Mick.

696
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,989
Oh, no.

697
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,196
Stop!

698
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,120
Don't hurt my friends.

699
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,716
Your friends?

700
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,156
- Or drones?
- No, they're better than that.

701
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,835
I'm not taking the chance.

702
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,673
No way I'm going back to prison.

703
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,434
A.T.O.M. suit, disassemble.

704
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,432
<i>Dr. Palmer voice authenticated.</i>

705
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,840
- Guess you're a drone too.
- That's enough. Zari.

706
00:35:13,961 --> 00:35:16,999
Great. Now let's
send this beast to hell.

707
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
Hell?

708
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,716
- What the hell?
- Guys, come on, look.

709
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,640
Let's think about this, all right?
She is not evil.

710
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,840
She stole your suit
and tried to kill us, Ray.

711
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,470
That's the ballsiest thing
you've ever done, Haircut.

712
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,496
She's only doing what any one of you
would have done if you were cornered.

713
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,557
We let her out. This is on us.

714
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,551
The portal is open.
Send the monster through.

715
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,477
I'll show you
what a real monster looks like.

716
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,960
Like this.

717
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,360
Like someone who would rather
do what's easy,

718
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,159
than figure out what's right.

719
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,756
Someone who would send
an innocent to hell.

720
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,032
Don't fall for
its bloody parlor tricks.

721
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,678
Ray said your team's
moral compass is missing.

722
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,473
Can you send her to hell?

723
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,136
Zari, you are too smart
to fall for this bloody creature.

724
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,441
Now send it through.
I can't keep the portal open forever.

725
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,034
No, I can't, I can't do it.

726
00:36:25,481 --> 00:36:27,481
All right, we're gonna
figure this out on the ship.

727
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,031
Fine, but I'm not letting
a shapeshifter on the bloody ship.

728
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,079
What did you do to me, you ass?

729
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,320
It's a lobotomy of sorts.

730
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,995
Your shapeshifting days
are over, sweetheart.

731
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,875
No!

732
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,958
Come on, you cowards!

733
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,350
<i>Bring it on! Come on down here!</i>

734
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,360
You can't just leave her
locked in there forever.

735
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,638
You are on thin ice in terms of
what we can and cannot do.

736
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,712
Those punks were
a bad influence on you.

737
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,840
Oh, well, maybe you just don't know
as much about me as you think you do.

738
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,599
You were an Eagle Scout,
former CEO of Palmer Tech.

739
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,912
Your favorite musical
is <i>Singin' in the Rain.</i>

740
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,559
You're allergic to cats and Grodd.

741
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,438
And you were knighted
by Queen Guinevere,

742
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,000
Sir Raymond of the Palms.

743
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,232
- Okay, so you know a lot.
- Yeah.

744
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,597
But you don't know that I was the man

745
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,592
who helped Nora Darhk
escape the Time Bureau.

746
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
You what?

747
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,959
She's not gonna
sleep with you, Haircut.

748
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,910
That is not why I did it.

749
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,911
I just...
I believe she can be a better person.

750
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,469
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe she's
a terrible, horrible monster,

751
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,440
but I believe she should be given
the chance to find out.

752
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,955
Everyone else on this ship
has been given a second chance.

753
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,040
Why doesn't she get one?

754
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:52,197
Look, you better not be wrong about her.

755
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,079
But right now, we need to deal
with our current captive.

756
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,799
She cannot stay on this ship.

757
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,798
Yeah, especially not with Amaya's face.

758
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,036
It's freaking creepy.

759
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,034
You broke her, you fix her, weasel.

760
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,190
Make her not Amaya again.

761
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,918
Spell doesn't work like that, Womble.

762
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,030
I took away her power to transform.

763
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:15,036
It's like clipping an angel's wings.
You can't exactly unclip them.

764
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,120
Whoo!

765
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,232
That was one surprisingly
strong little plant.

766
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,636
Surprisingly full of goo.

767
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,240
I like what you've done
with the place.

768
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,956
Sort of
a Little Office of Horrors theme.

769
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,671
Nate showed the plant who's boss,
Captain Lance.

770
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,513
- Oh, yeah?
- Although the plant did get in

771
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,398
- a lot of punches...
- Okay, Gar-Gar.

772
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,136
All right, let's leave a little
something to the imagination.

773
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,736
Speaking of, you should probably
change your shirt

774
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,880
before Ava gets back.
I can see where your nipple was.

775
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,480
And the handshake.

776
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,595
Oh.

777
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,956
You already found a new time bro.

778
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,190
He's growing on me.

779
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,920
Okay, but really, when are you
coming back to the ship?

780
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,118
There's a situation that I could
really use your input on.

781
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,318
When I took this job at the Time Bureau,

782
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,029
I thought I was doing it
for my dad or even maybe

783
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,278
a little bit for Ava,
but, um, the truth is

784
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,278
I was trying to avoid the <i>Waverider.</i>

785
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,436
Why?

786
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,512
Because every room
I went into on that ship,

787
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,353
I was hoping she'd be there.

788
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,678
- Amaya?
- Yeah.

789
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,280
But I'm over it.

790
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,590
Amaya is no longer on the <i>Waverider.</i>

791
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,075
That's it.

792
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,077
I'm sorry.
You wanted to talk about something.

793
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,920
Um...

794
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,557
No. It can... It'll wait.

795
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,190
Maybe a little Bureau time
is exactly what you need.

796
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,358
So I think you should stay here,

797
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,309
because I like to watch you grow.

798
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,471
- Mmm. Thank you, Sara.
- Yeah.

799
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,240
Hi.

800
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,790
Uh, wow...

801
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,879
So, enough chit-chat.

802
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,320
Dinner? Drinks?

803
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,576
- Should we just get straight to it?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

804
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,360
What did I say about
professional boundaries?

805
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
Sorry.

806
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,150
I mean, look at this place.

807
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,070
Can you please tell me

808
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,311
how do you keep five Legends
on a leash at once?

809
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,160
Very loosely.

810
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,597
Because sometimes
we pull you in the right direction.

811
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,114
Hey, you got a minute?

812
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,995
I just wanted to say, about the pub...

813
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,400
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

814
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,393
Listen, if you're here to have
some weepy heart-to-heart

815
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,960
end-of-the-mission hug fest

816
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,256
where you tell me that
my problems are your problems and that

817
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,590
happiness is just one friend away,
and all that bollocks,

818
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,149
don't bother, yeah.

819
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,072
Hey, you don't know me.

820
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,157
I wouldn't do that.
That would be lame.

821
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,230
Yeah, it would.

822
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,390
So, why are you here?

823
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,960
I wanted to give you

824
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,040
this surveillance photo
I took of you and your mom.

825
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,156
Thank you.

826
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,797
You know,
for not doing any of that stuff.

827
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,560
Yeah, anytime.

828
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,760
Yeah.

829
00:41:30,081 --> 00:41:31,355
I hate cops.

830
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,280
I am well aware of that, Mick.

831
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,432
Well, today we nearly became cops.

832
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,633
Yeah, but we didn't.

833
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,871
No. Thanks to you.

834
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,513
- Rage.
- Aw. Thanks, Mick.

835
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,840
All right, are you two plonkers

836
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,479
just gonna stand there
and stare at me?

837
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,756
Or is one of you gonna
pour me a bloody pint?

838
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,797
She definitely isn't Amaya.

839
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,960
Bah!

840
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,756
No, but I do like her.
