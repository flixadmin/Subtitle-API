00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:03,135
My name is Barry Allen,

3
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:06,138
And I am the fastest man alive.

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,007
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,008
By something impossible.

6
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,275
Run, Barry, run!

7
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:13,012
My father went to prison
for her murder.

8
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:16,949
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

9
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:18,250
To the outside world,

10
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:19,752
I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist,

11
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:22,454
But secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime

12
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:24,456
And find others like me.

13
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,258
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

14
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,326
Mom!

15
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:29,128
And get justice for my father.

16
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,964
I am the Flash.

17
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:34,299
Previously on <i>the Flash...</i>

18
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:36,468
Ronnie was vaporized
in the accelerator

19
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,636
When it went critical.

20
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:38,771
Ronnie's alive.

21
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:40,305
I saw him, Cisco.

22
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:43,776
Firestorm.

23
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:45,811
I wanted to talk to you
about firestorm.

24
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:48,213
We had some rudimentary success
with our stage one testing.

25
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,482
- Professor Stein...
- Professor Martin Stein?

26
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:51,984
He was our team leader.

27
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:53,786
I know what really happened
to him that night.

28
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:55,154
In the mass of energy.
Looks like...

29
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:56,955
- Ronnie.
- And Professor Stein.

30
00:00:56,957 --> 00:01:00,292
The dark matter
merged them together.

31
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:09,902
So how does a superhero
get ready for a date?

32
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:12,604

Yeah, yeah, that is
what my friends call me:

50
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:52,277
Mr. Punctual.

51
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,114
Is that lonely-looking flower
for me?

52
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:56,548
Is this dumb?

53
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,117
I thought about getting
a full bouquet,

54
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,018
But then I thought
that was weird.

55
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,753
No.

56
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,222
It's awesome.

57
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:04,623
All right.

58
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,666
Mm.

59
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:15,667
Okay.

60
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,803
Yes!

61
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,972
Victory.

62
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:22,174
I told you these were the
spiciest tacos in Central City.

63
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:23,642
Oh, I thought
you were bluffing.

64
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,310
I never bluff.

65
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,780
Just say it, I am the champion
of all things spicy.

66
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:33,118
You are the spice champion
of Central City.

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,920
Well, this requires
soap and water.

68
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:36,655
- I'll be right back.
- Mm-hmm.

69
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:42,761
Hey.

70
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,164
Robbery at the convenience store

71
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,299
On brand and Paulson.

72
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,635
Man, come on.
Kind of on a date.

73
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:51,803
Can't the cops get this one?

74
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,306
Fine, but when you read
in the paper tomorrow

75
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,608
About that poor little old lady
getting robbed...

76
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,510
How do you know
it's a little old lady?

77
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,246
Please,
it's always a little old lady.

78
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,016
Okay, all right.

79
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,151
No little old lady.

80
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,689
Your move, Allen.

81
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,024
What's next?

82
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,794
So what's wrong with you?

83
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:18,163
Why hasn't someone
snatched you up yet?

84
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,967
Oh.

85
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,236
It's work.
Just a sec.

86
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,171
Hey.

87
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,908
- Hello.
- Hey.

88
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,543
I know you're on a date,
but we got a jumper

89
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,811
On 52nd and Waid.

90
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:39,484
Sir, please,
you have everything to live for.

91
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:40,886
No, I don't.

92
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,293
Are you gonna let me go
back up there?

93
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,162
No.

94
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:56,802
Well, thanks.

95
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,470
Yeah.

96
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,577
What was that for?

97
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,247
To see if I wanted
a second date.

98
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,948
And?

99
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,150
Let me see one more time.

100
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,594
Definitely.

101
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,771
Quentin Quale.

102
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,240
Can I help you, young man?

103
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,976
Haven't been called that
in quite some time.

104
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,479
I'm sorry, do I know you?

105
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:41,780
We went to school together.

106
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,982
You're one of my students.

107
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,785
No, classmates.

108
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,921
University of Chicago,
class of '74.

109
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,523
We protested the war.

110
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:56,028
Make love, not napalm,
remember?

111
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,697
Look, I don't know if this is
some kind of practical joke...

112
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,399
I know about your brother.

113
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,037
The truth is,
he committed suicide.

114
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,972
You found the body.

115
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,640
I never told anyone
about that.

116
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:12,077
You told one person.

117
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,516
Martin?

118
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:20,352
I need you to help me.

119
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:33,465
Dude, you are a crime-fighting
lady-slaying machine.

120
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:34,833
Oh, god, it was so cool.

121
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,301
She was so cool.

122
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,936
We're going on another date
tonight.

123
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,471
Tonight? Really?

124
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:42,007
Aren't you worried
about moving too fast?

125
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,042
No. What do you mean?

126
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,677
It's a second date.

127
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,014
No, no, no, no, I meant
going too fast, hurrying.

128
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,649
Look, I mean, you're fast,

129
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:51,817
But there's fast,
and then there's fast.

130
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,118
Am I being subtle enough?

131
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,853
- You're really not.
- Cisco's right.

132
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,589
With your increased blood flow
and increased heart rate,

133
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,691
Theoretically, your speed
could cause you to...

134
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,027
You're gonna need to think
about a lot of dead puppies.

135
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,696
Like, we're talking
a whole kennel.

136
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,098
And baseball.

137
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,099
Cold showers.

138
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:08,367
You know what?
Nuns.

139
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,168
Okay.
It is just a second date.

140
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,738
A second date? With who?

141
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,273
Uh, with Linda Park,
the sports reporter.

142
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,541
Hello?

143
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,176
That's great.

144
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,379
Linda seems great,
and you're great.

145
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:23,682
So... Great.

146
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:27,018
Hey, I gotta go.
I gotta help out a friend.

147
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,587
Everything okay?
We just got here.

148
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,422
Yeah, I'll see
you guys later.

149
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:31,690
Quentin Quale
was attacked near his lab

150
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:34,059
At concordance research
last night.

151
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,328
There were several
unsubstantiated reports

152
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,863
Of the so-called "burning man"

153
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,664
In the area
following the attacks.

154
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,433
Burning man?

155
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:45,670
Caitlin, weren't you asking
about him a few weeks ago?

156
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,844
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

157
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:53,845
Thanks for meeting me.

158
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:54,946
Sure.

159
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,681
What exactly are
we doing here?

160
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,717
That's Barry's old house.

161
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,318
Where his mother
was murdered?

162
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,120
I have a theory about
who might have been involved

163
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,789
In Barry's mother's death.

164
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,791
I thought you and I could
reexamine the crime scene,

165
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:07,492
You could apply
your technical expertise

166
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,994
And help me prove
who really did it.

167
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:10,562
For sure,
we should get Dr. Wells

168
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:11,763
And Caitlin in on this.

169
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,098
No, we should keep this
between us

170
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,499
For the time being.

171
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,734
If too many people know,
Barry will find out,

172
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,068
And I don't want
to involve him

173
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,738
Until we know
something definitive.

174
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,145
Hello, ma'am.

175
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,448
I'm Detective West.

176
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,316
This is Cisco Ramon.

177
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,652
Oh, please, it's Sherry,
like the drink.

178
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,789
What can I do for you,
Detective?

179
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,157
I don't know
if you were aware,

180
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,126
But there was a homicide
in this residence

181
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,561
Approximately 15 years ago.

182
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:43,929
Oh, I know.

183
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,097
We've reopened
the investigation.

184
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,098
Do you mind if we come in

185
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,600
And take another look around?

186
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:51,970
Oh, not at all.

187
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,872
Thank you.

188
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,743
Do you live alone?

189
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:02,047
Yes, I'm divorced.

190
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,221
Well, it appears
letting Ronnie roam free

191
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:10,789
Is no longer an option.

192
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,691
He's not even Ronnie anymore.

193
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:16,161
He's Martin Stein walking
around in Ronnie's body,

194
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,562
Like a vampire.

195
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,364
Is there a reason
that Stein's brain

196
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,132
Is in control
of Ronnie's body,

197
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,300
Not the other way around?

198
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,735
Simple Darwinism, I suspect.

199
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,737
A brand-new organism
will select

200
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,173
The strongest parts of itself
in order to survive.

201
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,841
Survival of the fittest.

202
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,244
In this case, Ronnie's body,
stein's mind.

203
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:34,746
In any event,
he badly hurt an innocent man,

204
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,681
And we have hunted
meta-humans for less.

205
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:40,185
Caitlin, we need to know
that you're on board

206
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:44,689
With what needs to be
done here.

207
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,192
How do we find him?

208
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,462
Quentin Quale, the scientist
that Ronnie attacked,

209
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:52,898
Is a former colleague
of Martin Stein.

210
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,034
If Martin is indeed in control
of Ronnie's body,

211
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,904
He may be trying to figure out
exactly what's happening to him.

212
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,472
What do we know about him?

213
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:03,308
I don't even know
what Stein looks like.

214
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,744
Martin Stein.

215
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:06,745
That's Stein?

216
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,046
It is.

217
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,447
I've seen him before.

218
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,883
When?

219
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,020
On the train, the day
the accelerator exploded.

220
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,931
Super cool, isn't it?

221
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:29,434
Uh, S.T.A.R. Labs,
I mean.

222
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:33,038
Yes, it's...
Super cool.

223
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,573
Trust Harrison Wells

224
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:38,076
To build a particle accelerator
with a bit of style.

225
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,379
Most scientists
don't have an appreciation

226
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,315
For the value of aesthetics.

227
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,450
Albert Einstein said,
"once you can accept

228
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,519
"the universe as being
something expanding

229
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:50,055
Into an infinite nothing
which is actually something"...

230
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:54,426
"wearing stripes
with plaid becomes easy."

231
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,261
I thought people your age

232
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,063
Didn't read actual books
anymore.

233
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,064
Oh, I'm the only one.

234
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,899
Oh. Mm.

235
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:05,036
Physics.
Hobby or endeavor?

236
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,271
Both, actually.

237
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,806
I'm a CSI.

238
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,574
I work for the Central City
police department.

239
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:13,278
Really? You look
too young for that.

240
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,047
That is what they tell me.

241
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,818
Are you gonna watch
the accelerator turn on tonight?

242
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,620
I wouldn't miss it.

243
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,422
They say
it's going to change the world.

244
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,957
I hope so.

245
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,892
Carson station. Carson station.

246
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,128
Oh, this is my stop.

247
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,763
- It was nice talking to you.
- You too.

248
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:34,566
Maybe I will see you
there tonight.

249
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:35,734
Excuse me.

250
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,369
I'm taking a girlfriend.

251
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,704
Not my girlfriend,
she's just, uh...

252
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,906
Sorry... she's just
a female friend

253
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,108
Who I'm not dating yet.

254
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,409
The doors are about to close.

255
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,177
Yeah.

256
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,520
Don't turn it on!

257
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:59,290
Don't turn it on!
Don't turn it on!

258
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,826
Don't turn it on!
Don't turn it on!

259
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,073
Caitlin, whatever happens...

260
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,118
of course
I've heard of S.T.A.R. Labs.

261
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,121
Martin was always vocal
about the competition.

262
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,624
S.T.A.R. Labs is actually
helping the CCPD

263
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:35,927
Looking into your husband's
disappearance, Mrs. Stein.

264
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,029
Oh, please.
Call me Clarissa.

265
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,633
The Conway prize
for scientific advancement.

266
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:44,369
Martin was very proud
of that one.

267
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,638
I'd always hoped to win
one of these myself.

268
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,041
Oh, and look at that.
He won it three times.

269
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,710
Takes a special kind
of person

270
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,812
To make Dr. Wells
jealous.

271
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:57,649
Well, Martin had a talent
for making people jealous.

272
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,451
Even me.

273
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:03,154
I sometimes think Martin loved
his theorems and experiments

274
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,056
More than he did me.

275
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,727
I'm sure that's not true.

276
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,029
And you haven't heard
from your husband

277
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,064
Since he disappeared.

278
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,066
No.

279
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,870
Mrs. Stein, could I
show you a photograph?

280
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:22,006
Have you seen
this person before?

281
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:25,343
Yes, I have.

282
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,580
- Who is he?
- Um...

283
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,115
He's just a person
of interest

284
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:32,684
In your husband's case.

285
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,186
When did you see him?

286
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:38,757
I started getting the feeling
that someone was watching me,

287
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,992
And sometimes I still do.

288
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:44,929
And about a month
after Martin disappeared,

289
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:48,900
That young man
showed up here.

290
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,014
What happened to me?

291
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,184
A month...

292
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,585
A month.

293
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,192
Clarissa.

294
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,764
Clarissa.

295
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:22,233
Who are you?

296
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,636
How did you get in here?

297
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:28,807
Under the loose stone.
You leave a key for me there.

298
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,675
I'm always losing mine.

299
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:34,245
Losing my keys.
Losing my mind.

300
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,246
I'm going to call the police.

301
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:38,149
Losing my mind.

302
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,819
Where is my body?

303
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,288
I see my life,
but I can't reach it.

304
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,589
Please send someone.

305
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:47,458
There's an intruder
in my house!

306
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,797
So it appears Martin Stein
and Ronnie Raymond

307
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,567
Have something in common
besides sharing a body.

308
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:58,670
They both feel the need
to protect the women they love.

309
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:02,240
Clarissa said she feels
like she's being watched.

310
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,908
Well, then,

311
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,377
This has all the makings
of a stakeout.

312
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,846
But Barry's got
a date tonight.

313
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,180
I'll cancel.

314
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,416
No! No, go.

315
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:12,584
If we need you here,
something tells me

316
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:14,285
We can get you back
in a hurry.

317
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,960
I'm not picking up anything.
Not even with the super light.

318
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,328
Super light?

319
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,896
Well, technically
it's a multi-spectrum,

320
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,664
Ultraviolet laser-enhanced
scanner that detects

321
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,900
Molecular schisms
in the 600 mega-volt range,

322
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,802
But I figured "super light"
was easier to say.

323
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,637
Right, but what does
it tell you?

324
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,073
Nothing we didn't
already know about that night.

325
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,574
Okay, keep looking.

326
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,042
Ahem.

327
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,912
Uh, can I get you boys
something to drink?

328
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,247
Water? Soda?

329
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:44,983
Wine?

330
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:48,486
Uh, we're fine.
Thank you.

331
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,955
Well, if you change your mind,
I've been told

332
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:53,858
My strawberry daiquiris
are sinful.

333
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,897
I will not judge you.

334
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,233
Okay, Barry's mother's body
was found here,

335
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,869
Knife beside her,

336
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:07,405
Blood spatter on the wall
belonged to Nora.

337
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,774
Joe, I think...

338
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,277
I just think maybe
it's been too long,

339
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,946
And everything's different.

340
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:19,651
Except that mirror.

341
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:23,721
Sherry must have bought it
at the estate sale.

342
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:26,925
Oh, my god.

343
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,760
Silver nitrate.

344
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,628
The compound used
in photography.

345
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,631
It was often used
to back vintage mirrors.

346
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,370
If there were two speedsters
there that night,

347
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,306
The sparks from their movement
would have generated

348
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:44,208
Enough flashes
to actually expose images

349
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,643
Onto the silver nitrate.

350
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:46,978
You saying what
I think you're saying?

351
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,547
This mirror might
contain photographs

352
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:52,884
Of what actually happened
that night.

353
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,455
Hey!
You look great.

354
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,524
Well, I have
a big date tonight,

355
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,659
And I kind of wanted
to impress the guy.

356
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,594
I think I can speak
for that guy

357
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:08,032
And say that he is
super impressed.

358
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,702
So is this your place?
It's awesome.

359
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:13,771
Yeah. Well, not entirely.
I grew up here.

360
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,440
Is it really lame
that I live at home?

361
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,976
Not at all.
I still live with my parents.

362
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,044
Really?

363
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,380
No.
That would be so lame.

364
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,316
All right,
so here's the plan.

365
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,819
First, a dinner reservation
at paper clip.

366
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,488
Then a round of mini-golf,
followed by Mal Duncan,

367
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,256
Who is playing
at an underground jazz club.

368
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,825
But my foster dad
has a connection there,

369
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,126
So he hooked us up.

370
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,127
And if you're not
sick of me by then,

371
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,996
We can get froyo.

372
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,231
Or...

373
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,637
want some of my fries?

374
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,272
No, thanks.

375
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:51,776
Why would he come back here?

376
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:55,179
Because this is his home.

377
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,682
I don't mean
the actual house.

378
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,651
I mean Clarissa.
She's his home.

379
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:03,688
We all want to go home again.

380
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,692
You know, where we feel safe.

381
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,695
Where we feel loved.

382
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:14,532
Ronnie's your home.

383
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,402
Not anymore.

384
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,741
Remember what I told you on
your first day at S.T.A.R. Labs?

385
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,010
"A scientist's work
is never finished."

386
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,178
A scientist's work
is never finished.

387
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,413
Well, my work did this
to Ronnie

388
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,715
And did this to Martin Stein.

389
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,284
But it's not finished,
and it won't be

390
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,787
Until we bring them
both home.

391
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,764
So I'm assuming
you have Barry on speed dial?

392
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:52,203
♪ You and me, we made a vow ♪

393
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,839
Mm!

394
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,909
Whoa! What's wrong?
That felt amazing.

395
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,178
I just got a little excited.

396
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,312
I would hope so.

397
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:04,015
Sorry, Linda, I'm just, um,

398
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:06,451
A little worried about, um,

399
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,352
Moving too fast.

400
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:10,788
It's okay.

401
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,592
I hate slow.

402
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:22,266

403
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,669
I'm sorry, I should check

404
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,104
Just in case
it's an emergency.

405
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,072
Ah!
Okay.

406
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:31,275
♪ I still need you here ♪

407
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,743
I'm so sorry.

408
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,146
It's important.

409
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:38,116
Not that this isn't important.

410
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:41,152
It's just that, um,
this other thing

411
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,554
Is time sensitive...
ah!

412
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:46,791
Otherwise there's no way
that I would be leaving you.

413
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,961
No one in their right mind
would leave you.

414
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,096
Um, your shirt's
on backwards.

415
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,398
Yeah, I got it.
Okay.

416
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,567
I will text you, all right?

417
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,436
Uh, no, I'll call you.
I'll call you.

418
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,671
Or how about I just...
I'll just do both, okay?

419
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,140
I'll do both.

420
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,876
I'm so sorry.

421
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,517
Professor Stein.

422
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,819
Hey,
I'm not here to hurt you,

423
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,054
And I know you don't
want to hurt anyone else,

424
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:20,057
So if you could just not...

425
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,592
Flame on.

426
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,745
No!

427
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,424
Well, that was terrifying.

428
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,533
I sent Sherry to the movies.

429
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,535
Trust me,
the best show in town

430
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,303
Is going to be
in here tonight.

431
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:40,805
So you're telling me
you can get actual photographs

432
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:41,872
From this thing?

433
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,174
The science is solid.

434
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:45,142
It works exactly like
an old film camera.

435
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,978
I developed
the mirror backing,

436
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,679
And fortunately for us,

437
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,716
The lightning went off
about ten times that night.

438
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:53,050
Multiple exposures.

439
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:54,485
Now you're getting it.

440
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:55,753
I went ahead
and enhanced them digitally

441
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,055
And, just for kicks,

442
00:20:58,057 --> 00:20:59,790
Decided to extrapolate
a 3-d hologram

443
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:00,825
From the original 2-d.

444
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:02,560
Cisco.

445
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:04,695
Lights.

446
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,398
Camera.

447
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,867
Action.

448
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,669
Wow.

449
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,189
Can you play it again?
Slower?

450
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,194
There, there.
You see that?

451
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,500
Huh.

452
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,504
Next frame.

453
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,453
This wallpaper's new.

454
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,426
Oh, man.
Is that blood?

455
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,696
We had a husband
who was holding

456
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:13,297
The same weapon
that killed his wife.

457
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,499
We weren't looking
for any other suspects.

458
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,768
That blood belongs
to one of the two speedsters

459
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,104
That was here that night.

460
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:22,340
Maybe the one
that killed Nora.

461
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:25,810
I'll get a sample kit.

462
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:28,346
I got you.

463
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,285
That's great.

464
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:35,653
Linda, hey.

465
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:37,121
Hey!

466
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:38,622
So I hope it's cool
that I came by.

467
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:39,990
Yeah, of course.

468
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:41,826
I was just writing
a column on the combines.

469
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,527
Oh, sweet,
how are they doing?

470
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,630
Well, they were up
two goals to none last night,

471
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:49,700
But then they blew it.

472
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:54,138
Wait, we're not talking
about hockey anymore, are we?

473
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,840
No. We're not.

474
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:59,110
Look, I am so, so sorry
that I left you like that.

475
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:02,079
I'm... I'm not
that kind of guy.

476
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:05,783
Well, let me tell you
what kind of girl I am.

477
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:08,085
I work in a hard business,
and I work hard in it.

478
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,221
And so I'm very picky
about who I choose

479
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,256
To spend my free time with.

480
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:14,658
I chose to spend
some of it with you, so...

481
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,229
Tell me, Barry Allen,
did I make the right choice?

482
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,497
Yeah, you did.

483
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:22,166
It just that something important
came up.

484
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,934
And not more important
than you,

485
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:26,604
It's just sort of, like,
an equal level of importance

486
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,406
Type situation...

487
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:32,777
And... and usually I can
do both,

488
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:35,913
Um, but it's just
that I have to, um...

489
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:41,118
I have to go to work.
I'm so sorry.

490
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,887
It's a police emergency.

491
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:45,055
Can we talk later tonight?

492
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,491
I'm not
going anywhere... Yet.

493
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,660
Okay, thanks.

494
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:50,728
- Hey!
- Hey!

495
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,163
Sorry, gotta go.
Uh...

496
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:54,031
Hey!
What's up?

497
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,033
Bye.

498
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,701
Hey, can I ask you
a question?

499
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:59,203
Yeah, sure.

500
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:02,306
So, um, you and Barry
are like bffs, right?

501
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,442
The best of bffs.

502
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,944
Has he ever actually
dated anyone before?

503
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,947
Because he's simultaneously
surprisingly good at it

504
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,515
And really, really bad at it.

505
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:12,516
I don't know.

506
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:15,119
He's... Barry.

507
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,521
What was
his last girlfriend like?

508
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:20,958
You know, he hasn't really
had a girlfriend in a while.

509
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,494
I don't know,
maybe he's just not ready yet.

510
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:25,062
What do you mean?

511
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:27,898
You know, I mean,
he was into someone,

512
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,968
An unrequited love thing.

513
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,470
You know, he had
feelings for someone,

514
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:36,607
And they weren't
really reciprocated, so...

515
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:39,910
Yeah, maybe just
give him time.

516
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:41,479
Sure.

517
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,183
There he is.

518
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:51,288
Looks like the tracker
Barry placed on him worked.

519
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,590
Professor Stein?

520
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:54,658
Ugh, I told you
to stay away from me.

521
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,495
And I will,
but there's someone else

522
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:00,064
Who wants to talk to you.

523
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:01,532
Martin?

524
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:09,406
Do you know who I am?

525
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:11,308
Clarissa.

526
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,810
Is it really you?

527
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:14,411
I don't know.

528
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:17,014
I hear the other
inside of me.

529
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:20,751
He wants to go home to her.

530
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:24,588
But we can't.
I want to be me again.

531
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,959
Martin...
What's my favorite color?

532
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:36,033
You could...
you could never decide,

533
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,334
So you chose stripes.

534
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:46,410
You shouldn't see me
like this.

535
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:48,879
I see you.

536
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,316
I see you, Martin.

537
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:54,652
These people can help you.

538
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:58,122
They say they can.
Please let them.

539
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:04,762
Please... Help us.

540
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,541
Well, we got him.
Them.

541
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:18,576
Now what?

542
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:19,977
Well, Stein clearly thinks

543
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:21,612
He can separate himself
from Ronnie's body

544
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:22,947
Using nuclear fission.

545
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:24,248
What do you think?

546
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,450
What do I think?

547
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:29,920
Is it possible?
Theoretically.

548
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,255
But splitting an atom
and splitting a man

549
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,290
Are two
very different things.

550
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,998
I don't suppose it's necessary
to point out you're all staring?

551
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,069
Our apologies.

552
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,637
It is remarkable.

553
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:49,773
I feel clearer than I have
since the accident.

554
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,141
What did you give me?

555
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:53,777
A cocktail of anti-psychotics,
depressants,

556
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,579
And mood stabilizers.

557
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:59,083
The same formula used to treat
dissociative identity disorders.

558
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:02,486
I assume this was your idea?

559
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:04,622
Very clever, Cait.

560
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:06,156
Don't call me that.

561
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:07,458
Please.

562
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,627
I apologize.

563
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:12,029
We'd like
to run some tests on you,

564
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:13,497
If you don't mind.

565
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:18,469
Of course, Dr. Snow.

566
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,604
Hey, I'm so sorry I had
to run out like that again.

567
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:23,674
Uh, police business.

568
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:25,643
That's funny, because
I just called the station,

569
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:28,178
And they said that you had
taken some personal time.

570
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,281
I'm not mad, Barry, I swear.

571
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:33,183
But I do think
that we should call it.

572
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:34,652
W-wait, can we
talk about this?

573
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:35,819
What do you mean?

574
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,054
Look, I know
how hard and weird it is

575
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:38,489
Trying to date someone new

576
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,524
When you're still not
over someone.

577
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,126
What are you talking about?

578
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:43,861
You and Iris.

579
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:46,764
Me and Iris, we're not...

580
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:48,432
Who told you that
I was hung up on Iris?

581
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,038
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

582
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,543
Uh, why would you tell Linda
that I had feelings for you?

583
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:01,278
I did not say that.

584
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,613
Wait, did I?

585
00:28:02,615 --> 00:28:03,747
Okay, Iris, this isn't funny.

586
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,582
I mean, I like this girl.

587
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,885
I know,
and I am happy for you.

588
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:10,287
Really? Because I don't...
I mean, right now

589
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,856
It sort of feels like
you don't want to be with me

590
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,025
And you don't want anyone else
to be with me either.

591
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,327
I have wanted nothing more
than for you to meet someone

592
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,328
Who is amazing.

593
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,396
And I did!

594
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:20,831
And you went out of your way

595
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:23,701
To convince her
that I was unavailable.

596
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:25,869
Look, I'm really sorry.

597
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,072
Great.

598
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:29,239
Wait, do you want me
to talk to her?

599
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,608
No, no, no.
Absolutely not.

600
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,944
Don't talk to her.
I'll figure this out on my own.

601
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:37,347
I just need you to know that

602
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,150
I don't have those feelings
for you anymore.

603
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:45,289
Yeah, I know.

604
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:48,225
Okay.

605
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,928
I'll see you later.

606
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,270
Yes, yes, yes!

607
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:03,173
See? We got
two different blood samples.

608
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,075
- One for each speedster.
- That's right.

609
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,477
One is a-positive,

610
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:08,579
And the other one's
ab-negative... super rare.

611
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,614
I'm gonna run them both through
the CCPD criminal database

612
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,116
To see if I get any matches.

613
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:14,685
Can you run them
against a specific person?

614
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,587
Yeah, sure, if we
have something to match it to.

615
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,589
Who are we looking at?

616
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,657
Dr. Harrison Wells.

617
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:30,100
I thought we were trying
to solve Barry's mom's murder.

618
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,668
We are.

619
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,506
And I'm asking you
to keep this between us.

620
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:39,777
You think Dr. Wells
killed Barry's mom?

621
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,279
No way.
He didn't even know Barry then.

622
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,982
Why would he kill his mom?

623
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:47,484
I don't know yet.

624
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:51,255
But I do know
that Wells keeps secrets.

625
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:53,157
And this may be one of them.

626
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:56,160
Dr. Wells
is a great man.

627
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:58,162
I was nothing
when he gave me a job,

628
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:00,631
A chance to change my life.

629
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,634
He has helped so many people.
He's not a murderer.

630
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:07,337
Cisco, I'm a cop.

631
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,939
I'm good at reading people,

632
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:13,277
So I know I can trust you
with my suspicion.

633
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,312
When I go talk
to the family and friends

634
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,747
Of a murder suspect,

635
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:19,583
Somebody I know is guilty,

636
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:22,252
And I tell them the person
they love is a killer,

637
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:25,522
Guess what they all say.

638
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:28,058
That's not the person I know.

639
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:34,565
I think I'm done
being a cop for today.

640
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,740
Are you comfortable?

641
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:45,609
A little warm.

642
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:49,813
Ronnie used to always
run warm.

643
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:53,650
Not that warm.

644
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:56,753
Can I talk to him?

645
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:58,322
I'm sorry, my dear.

646
00:30:58,324 --> 00:31:00,757
I'm not sure
it works like that.

647
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:03,627
I can feel him though.

648
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:05,629
I have these memories.

649
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:08,899
Memories that I know
aren't my own.

650
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:11,368
One is particularly strong.

651
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,736
Piedmont state park?

652
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:15,806
It's famous
for the Hudson falls.

653
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:17,341
I know that I've never been,

654
00:31:17,343 --> 00:31:21,044
But I can remember
those waterfalls perfectly.

655
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:26,483
That's where Ronnie
proposed to me.

656
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:29,486
He loves you very much.

657
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:33,457
That I can feel.

658
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:36,526
Dr. Snow, can we
see you for a minute?

659
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:39,529
Excuse me.

660
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,333
You okay?

661
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:46,036
Yeah, it's just confusing.

662
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:49,339
What isn't confusing is
what's happening to him now.

663
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,141
Ronnie's body is rejecting
stein's atoms

664
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:54,011
Like a host
rejecting a parasite.

665
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:57,848
The resulting instability is
causing an exothermic reaction.

666
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,584
I worry if his temperature
continues to rise,

667
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:03,287
It'll set off
a chain reaction.

668
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:05,856
And then what happens?

669
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,593
He could go nuclear.

670
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,805
Ronnie.

671
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,373
Not Ronnie.

672
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,741
Martin Stein.

673
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,443
Cisco Ramon.

674
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:27,878
Your colleagues are
in the next room,

675
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,947
Not so subtly discussing
my condition.

676
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:36,954
That's not freaky at all.

677
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:38,755
It seems Ronnie's fight
with the Flash

678
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:41,425
Has exacerbated
the firestorm matrix.

679
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:43,293
It's unstable.

680
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,629
Exponentially increasing
the rate of fission

681
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,130
Inside his body.

682
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,633
Well, how long does he have?

683
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:53,570
If his temperature keeps
rising at the current pace,

684
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:55,072
No more
than a couple of hours.

685
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:56,773
But you can fix it, right?

686
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:58,809
I mean, you... you can separate
them before it's too late.

687
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:02,379
Any attempt we make
to separate the two of them

688
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:06,283
Could be catastrophic...
a nuclear explosion.

689
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:08,285
And a nuclear explosion
of this magnitude

690
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:10,687
Would level this entire city.

691
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:12,889
Unless...

692
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,825
Unless what?

693
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:19,096
Unless the host body
were no longer functional.

694
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:20,330
You want to kill Ronnie?

695
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:23,433
No, I don't want
to kill Ronnie.

696
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:26,336
But in this scenario,
Ronnie is the host body.

697
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,205
If you kill Ronnie,
you kill Stein.

698
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:29,606
That's two people.

699
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:32,376
I don't know how else
to stop it.

700
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:36,013
And my guess is that
if Ronnie and Professor Stein

701
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:38,315
knew the consequences
that we were all facing,

702
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:40,117
they would make
the same decision.

703
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:43,420
It's two lives for millions.

704
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,060
Can you give us a minute?

705
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,933
Caitlin...

706
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,769
I've already lost
Ronnie once.

707
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:02,172
I'm not going to do it again.

708
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:05,008
You said we have
a couple of hours.

709
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,610
Use them.

710
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,885
Dr. Wells,
you don't really think

711
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,953
we should kill Ronnie,
do you?

712
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,856
Stay here, Cisco.

713
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:32,235
Hey. Sorry.

714
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,838
Um, can I get you anything
or...

715
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,075
A glass of Chateau Haut-Brion
Pessac-Leognan 1982

716
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:40,877
might be nice.

717
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,712
Or maybe it wouldn't.

718
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,581
This body's taste buds
would obviously

719
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,117
Be different from my own.

720
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,187
Perhaps I'm now
a light beer man.

721
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:52,222
There are worse things to be.

722
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:56,560
You mean like
a living nuclear bomb?

723
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:57,928
You know.

724
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,063
Unstable nuclear fission
was always a danger

725
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:02,933
In the transmutation process.

726
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:07,637
Plus, you all argue
very loudly.

727
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,339
I'm sorry.

728
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:10,607
But my friends
are gonna figure out

729
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,576
How to fix this, I promise.

730
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:15,979
I remember meeting you,
Mr. Allen, on the train.

731
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:18,515
You were headed
to S.T.A.R. Labs with a girl

732
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:20,584
But not your girlfriend.

733
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,154
Yeah.

734
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:28,959
I'm not sure that
I have any girlfriend.

735
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:32,562
You know,
Einstein was not only brilliant,

736
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:35,332
He had
a great sense of humor.

737
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,400
How did it go?

738
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:40,670
"Any man who drives safely
while kissing a pretty girl

739
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:45,542
Is not giving the pretty girl
the attention she deserves."

740
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,247
If I learned anything
this past year,

741
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:52,749
Life's too short not to live.

742
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,859
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

743
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:05,162
- I gave you an out.
- I don't want an out.

744
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:06,997
I don't wanna date someone
who's into someone else.

745
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:07,998
I'm not into anyone else.

746
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,799
I'm gonna prove it to you.

747
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:11,501
This is the Naga Jolokia

748
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,836
Or the ghost pepper.

749
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,371
It is
the world's hottest pepper

750
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:18,208
Measuring 401.5 times hotter
than Tabasco sauce.

751
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,510
If you do not agree
to go on another date with me,

752
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,747
I will eat it right here,
right now.

753
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,151
You're bluffing.

754
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:29,519
I never bluff.

755
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,026
Are you okay?

756
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:37,961
- I'm fine, yeah.
- You sure?

757
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:39,996
Mm-hmm.
Mm!

758
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:42,299
Yes!
Yes, I'll go out with you.

759
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:44,534
That pepper could have
killed you, nerd.

760
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,040
Oh, thank you.

761
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,341
Okay.

762
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:54,144
I won't let my job...

763
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:56,813
Or how bad my mouth
is burning right now

764
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:59,182
Come between us.

765
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:02,552
My spice champion
of Central City.

766
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:21,471
A crude weapon,
if I may say so, Dr. Wells.

767
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:24,774
I couldn't agree more,
Gideon.

768
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:26,843
But it will do the job.

769
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:39,556
Gideon,
can the tachyon prototype

770
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:41,458
Be converted
into a quantum splicer?

771
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,227
Theoretically,
but I must warn you, Dr. Wells,

772
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:48,031
Converting the tachyon prototype
will delay your timetable.

773
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:49,366
There's not going to be
a timetable

774
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:52,569
If Central City goes up
in a mushroom cloud.

775
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:55,605
Hey. Anything?

776
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,740
I have an idea.

777
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:58,642
It's a bit of a hail mary,

778
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:00,543
But Cisco and I
are going to give it a try.

779
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:01,978
Thank you.

780
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,947
I'll get Professor Stein.

781
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,515
Looking for the Professor?

782
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:08,518
Yeah, he's gone.

783
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:15,825
You guys almost done?

784
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:17,093
Hang on. Hang on.

785
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,928
I found Stein.
He's in the badlands.

786
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,765
Middle of nowhere, 30 miles
outside of Central City.

787
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:25,535
- Minimum safe distance.
- He's sacrificing himself.

788
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:28,004
How much time
does he have left?

789
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:30,607
12 minutes.

790
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:32,709
And...

791
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:34,210
We're done.

792
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:35,679
What is it?

793
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:39,349
This is a quantum splicer.

794
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:40,383
Will it work
to separate them?

795
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,319
We'll know in 12 minutes.

796
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:44,621
Now, Barry, even you
can't outrun a nuclear blast,

797
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:46,690
So you get this device
to Professor Stein,

798
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:49,693
And you get out of there
as fast as you can.

799
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:51,294
- What are you doing?
- I'm going with you.

800
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:53,697
- No, you're not.
- It's too dangerous!

801
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,765
Barry doesn't know
how to operate the splicer.

802
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,133
Cisco's gonna talk me
through it.

803
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:58,435
There's not enough time.

804
00:38:58,437 --> 00:38:59,536
Let's go.

805
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:01,805
Go!

806
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,413
What was that?

807
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,018
Uh, comm system's
on the fritz.

808
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,686
I'll be right back.

809
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:20,590
Cisco.

810
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,258
I'm not proud of it,
but I ran the samples.

811
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,561
One wasn't identified,
and the other had a match.

812
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:26,496
Cisco, you're hesitating.
Was it Wells?

813
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:27,997
No, it's not Dr. Wells.

814
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:30,333
I told you,
he has nothing to do with this.

815
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,702
But I know whose blood it is.

816
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,037
It's Barry's.

817
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,072
We already know
Barry was there that night.

818
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:38,341
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

819
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:40,377
The sample had high levels
of p16.

820
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:43,079
That's a protein that builds up
in the blood as we get older.

821
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:46,950
And these levels were
way too high for an 11-year-old.

822
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:50,520
This sample was from Barry
as an adult.

823
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,905
Professor Stein!

824
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,007
What are you doing here?
You can't be here!

825
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:13,009
Get her out of here now!

826
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:16,446
Please, look, Ronnie's still
in there somewhere.

827
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:19,682
All those people... Clarissa...
I won't let them die!

828
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:21,751
It's better I end this now.

829
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,787
We can separate you!

830
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:26,956
We can stop the explosion.

831
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:27,957
How?

832
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,526
A quantum splicer.

833
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:32,529
It's a fission device
designed to bombard your atoms

834
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,264
With as much energy
as they experienced

835
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,533
In the particle accelerator
explosion.

836
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:38,701
It should be enough
to separate you.

837
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:42,138
Please, Professor,
you have nothing left to lose.

838
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:52,449
Ronnie, if you're in there,
I love you.

839
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,728
That was from him.

840
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:10,166
I look forward to meeting you
in person, Professor.

841
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,278
It's not working!

842
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,013
He's not gonna make it.
He's gonna blow.

843
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,114
Get out of there.

844
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:27,917
Barry, get out of there now!

845
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:29,619
- No! No!
- Caitlin, we have to go.

846
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:31,788
Run!

847
00:41:34,426 --> 00:41:36,359
No!

848
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,411
Sir, we have
a thermonuclear detonation

849
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:58,414
Approximately 30 miles northeast
of Central City.

850
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:01,518
Deploy the rapid response team,
sergeant.

851
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,586
Bring me firestorm.

852
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,443
Greg, move your head.
