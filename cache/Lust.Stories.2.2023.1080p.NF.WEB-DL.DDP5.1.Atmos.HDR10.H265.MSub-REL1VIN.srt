1
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:44,292
Sister, when we went shopping, he looked
at the embroidery more than the clothes.

2
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,250
- Even now, look!
- Yes, he thought that would get him girls.

3
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,417
I got her.

4
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:50,917
Rubbish!

5
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,042
Yes, samosas!

6
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:54,833
Wow!

7
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:57,458
If you do all of this,
I won't agree to this marriage!

8
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:01,583
His limbs are intact,
he can take his food by himself.

9
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,625
If you serve him now,
he'll order you around all his life.

10
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:09,292
- Hey, Chiku, where's your mother?
- I'll take it.

11
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:10,708
She'll be here soon.

12
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,292
Two hours after sunrise,
and two hours before sunset,

13
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,167
even if someone dies,
Mom won't leave her Goddess' side.

14
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,333
Talk about better things!

15
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,208
And stay away from those samosas.

16
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,583
Put them down, come on.

17
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,500
Yes, give it to me.

18
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,458
Did you make them, Veda?

19
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,875
Have you put something sweet in these?

20
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:44,250
Grandma, it's sweet potato.
It's healthy.

21
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,542
Don't worry, eat it.

22
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:50,458
How can something that's not palatable
be good for health?

23
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:53,083
What's with your enmity with potatoes?

24
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,667
Not enmity, it's more of a friendship.

25
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:58,125
Whoever eats potatoes turns into one!

26
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:03,292
They're made for each other.

27
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,292
As a child, he would separate the potatoes
from the stuffed parathas.

28
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:13,000
But it is beyond me how today's generation
is so crazy about being fit.

29
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:14,208
Mom…

30
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:18,500
Not just being anti-potatoes,
I've heard they match on multiple levels.

31
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,167
I mean, three months
of chatting and walking…

32
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,772
I must say, you've profited a lot from it.

33
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:30,000
Sister, one can never tell
what nature has in store for us.

34
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,333
Now, for example, meeting Dabbu
in the market after 12 years,

35
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:35,708
which led to meeting you
for a cup of tea.

36
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,583
And right before I finish that cup,
Arjun entering your house.

37
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:41,958
Who knew I'd go shopping for vegetables
and come back with new relatives.

38
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,167
While I was here
matching their horoscopes,

39
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:50,167
these two already found out
everything about each other.

40
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:56,750
Sufi songs, Chinese food,
traveling the world, going for treks,

41
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,542
wanting to be CEO's.

42
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:00,083
They're so alike!

43
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,417
- Mom, please stop it.
- Stop what?

44
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,167
What's the big deal about talking
in front of our family?

45
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:09,083
I would say that you two are really lucky

46
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:13,167
that you have so much… compatibility!

47
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,000
Quickly say yes, brother.

48
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,542
If our son elopes
with your daughter on the night train,

49
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:19,917
don't come to us with any complaints!

50
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,958
Well, I'd say run away!
We'll save a fortune on the wedding!

51
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,375
Excuse me, Papa?

52
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,458
You had sex?

53
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,625
Coital conjugation…

54
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,333
Conjugated?

55
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:44,667
Mom!

56
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,750
What kind of nonsense is this?

57
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,500
Is your birth the result
of a nonsensical act?

58
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,375
You are the ones without any sense!

59
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,458
Grandma…

60
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:58,625
I asked because
we're talking about marriage.

61
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:03,917
Before buying a car,
don't you go for a test drive first?

62
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,542
Why no test drive before marriage?

63
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:11,833
Marriage is no joke, child.

64
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:15,583
It will decide
the course of your entire life .

65
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:19,667
Sorry! Mom, you aren't feeling well.
Let's go.

66
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,375
No, please let her speak.

67
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,958
Do you doubt our son?

68
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,250
Yes.

69
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:26,625
- Chiku, what is this?
- I'm--

70
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:28,375
Grandma, we're getting married--

71
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,583
That's why the doubt.

72
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,667
You also should doubt my granddaughter.

73
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,458
Leave us aside,
even they should have doubts,

74
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,042
whether they're compatible or not,

75
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,375
in the bedroom.

76
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:02,458
It's good. It's great
that both of them like Chinese food.

77
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:03,542
Good.

78
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,375
But how long will
the noodles keep them tied to each other?

79
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:14,208
After hours in the office,
working hard to become CEOs,

80
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,625
why would they still be eager
to see each other?

81
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,792
To listen to Sufi songs?

82
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,750
Or to plan for a trek?

83
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:26,167
No.

84
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,333
Whether their horoscopes are
a perfect match or not,

85
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:33,667
if the sex is good,

86
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:37,875
these two won't leave each other.

87
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:10,667
Grandma…

88
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,375
Hey, come here.

89
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:18,458
- You weren't sleeping, right?
- No, I was just lying down.

90
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,417
- Come.
- You're so funny, Grandma!

91
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:23,292
No.

92
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:25,417
I wasn't joking.

93
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,000
Grandma! Like a nuclear attack happened.

94
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,375
One blast took two houses down!

95
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,625
Mom and Dad aside,
poor Uncle Dabbu and Aunt Reena…

96
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:36,708
you should have seen their faces!

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,333
Yes, they are poor indeed.

98
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:41,042
Here.

99
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,083
This is a worldwide phenomenon.

100
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,583
The poverty of thought.

101
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:51,333
How is Arjun?

102
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,417
He's fine.

103
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,500
He's cool.

104
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,250
He was laughing uncontrollably!

105
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,542
I'm not asking about the reaction,

106
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,583
I'm asking about the action!

107
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,667
How's he?

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,083
I'll… I'll find out and let you know.

109
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,167
Quickly.

110
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:17,000
Hey… what's the hurry?

111
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,083
Wow!

112
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,458
You're not in a hurry?

113
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,458
That means you two aren't meant to be.

114
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,917
Everything is not about sex, okay?

115
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:36,625
And, I'm not that inexperienced.

116
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,125
I know. I have had boyfriends.

117
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,417
But…

118
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,333
marriage is something else.

119
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:52,583
Child, I'm not saying that
the one you have great sex with

120
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,042
is the one you should get married to.

121
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:56,792
All I'm saying is…

122
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,458
you need to make sure that…

123
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:05,583
sex with the person you marry is great.

124
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,375
Grandma!

125
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:09,542
Understood!

126
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:11,917
Understood!

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,750
But… why didn't I see
this side of you before?

128
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,625
Grandma, you're so passionate! So sexy!

129
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,583
You're such a rockstar, Grandma.

130
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,792
If your Grandpa…

131
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,792
was still alive…

132
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:33,000
then the door to this room
would be locked from the inside.

133
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,333
Oh, wow!

134
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:39,875
I mean… he was that good?

135
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,708
Not just that he was good,
we were good.

136
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,125
This-- Open this small drawer.

137
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,042
It's the last pack.

138
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:00,667
Grandma, this…

139
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:03,875
If there's ever a chance, why risk it?

140
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,792
It was always by our side.

141
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:13,125
Or who knows, you'd have an uncle
playing in your arms.

142
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,708
Hey, no, keep it back.

143
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,208
It's past its expiry date,
like your grandfather.

144
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:26,917
Tell me one thing.

145
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,458
You had an arranged marriage, right?

146
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:36,125
So, how did you know if
the both of you were compatible?

147
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,500
Arranged marriage was
for the ones who arranged it.

148
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,750
We were by the river banks…

149
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,917
or in sugarcane fields…

150
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,417
or inside the empty bogies
of the railway yard…

151
00:11:54,333 --> 00:12:00,000
and so many other places,
checking our compatibility.

152
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:07,000
Nowadays, you kids have so much comfort!

153
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,667
- You can do it.
- Grandma!

154
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,542
- Come on!
- You can do it.

155
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,792
Grandma, I'm going.

156
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:18,292
You're so sexy!

157
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,083
Good morning, son.

158
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,000
<i>Play the game</i>

159
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:46,125
<i>The game of love, player</i>

160
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,917
<i>Let your body and soul</i>

161
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:49,792
<i>Swing by the gates of heaven</i>

162
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,750
<i>Play the game</i>

163
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,917
<i>The game of love, player</i>

164
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,750
<i>Let your body and soul</i>

165
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:58,042
<i>Swing by the gates of heaven</i>

166
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:00,833
<i>Let candles of desire</i>

167
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,125
<i>Light up nights in your heart</i>

168
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,833
<i>As creases smile at your sight</i>

169
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,583
<i>Marvel at this maddening delight</i>

170
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,708
<i>Play the game</i>

171
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,667
<i>The game of love, player</i>

172
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:19,750
<i>Let your body and soul</i>

173
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,167
<i>Swing by the gates of heaven</i>

174
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:57,958
I'm really worried.
Where's the time?

175
00:13:58,292 --> 00:13:59,667
We have the date now, it'll work out.

176
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,333
Where have you been?

177
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,292
Please thank God
that despite your obscene talks,

178
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,083
Dabbu and I are still friends.

179
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:10,000
The 28th of the next month
is an auspicious date for the wedding.

180
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:13,500
Let something auspicious happen before
the wedding.

181
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:15,625
Have you lost it?

182
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,375
- You take care of this woman.
- Hey!

183
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:22,917
This wedding will not take place
until Veda and Arjun--

184
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,125
Oh, God!

185
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,667
What do you want?

186
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,500
- Before getting married, should she--
- Disgusting!

187
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,625
What's disgusting?

188
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:35,708
What is it?

189
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,625
I don't want to repeat the same mistake.

190
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:43,208
All of these unspoken,
disgusting things are reasons

191
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:45,958
for Suchi's life being the way it is.

192
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,208
What's wrong with my life?

193
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:51,042
It is dead.

194
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:53,917
Ended right after getting married.

195
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,708
I'm happy, Mother.

196
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:02,833
One who hasn't experienced joy in years
can't know what it is.

197
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,917
When did you last sleep together?

198
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Mom!

199
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,542
Don't shout.

200
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,917
Producing a child is by no means

201
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,833
the gold standard of a healthy sex life.

202
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,292
I'm not saying there's a problem
with you or her.

203
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,417
But there's surely a problem
with this pair.

204
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,208
You're just 52.

205
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,875
And she's just 48.

206
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,250
Before forging new relationships…

207
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,333
rekindle the existing ones.

208
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:47,125
I should've said all of this
when her parents came to me

209
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,000
with a marriage proposal for you.

210
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,375
It's 1:00 a.m. and Veda isn't home yet.

211
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,500
<i>Arjun also hasn't returned yet either.</i>

212
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:04,708
He was talking about some farewell.

213
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,417
Veda also must be with him at the party.

214
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
<i>Or maybe…</i>

215
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:12,958
they're clearing your mother's doubts.

216
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,750
Man, it's your son and my daughter.

217
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,125
<i>Don't turn this into a joke.</i>

218
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,917
Sorry, man! Cheers! Sorry!

219
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:45,333
How was it?

220
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:46,833
What?

221
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:50,375
I've left God's side to come talk to you.

222
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:52,958
How was it?

223
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:55,958
Grandma!

224
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:57,958
Nice.

225
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,708
"Nice" is a sugar-coated biscuit.

226
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:05,667
No, we are… we are good.
We're good.

227
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,708
Did Mount Fuji erupt?

228
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:10,417
What?

229
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,292
It was your grandpa's code word.

230
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:16,417
He would ask me every time.

231
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,875
This body…

232
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,333
is a volcano like Mount Fuji.

233
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,042
Only satisfied once it erupts.

234
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,625
Mount Fuji?

235
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:39,667
Mount-- Grandma, I really
didn't know you were so wild inside!

236
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:40,833
My God!

237
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:44,708
Why do you hide this image behind
this pious, religious stuff?

238
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,875
Meditation clears up the mind.

239
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:51,542
Did it erupt or not?

240
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It did.

241
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,000
Both?

242
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,542
Grandma, you're just so embarrassing!

243
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,167
This is very embarrassing, Grandma.

244
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:12,333
Embarrassing is better than depressing.

245
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,250
Okay.

246
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:27,708
Grandma, it was the first time.
And you know, guys, they erupt first.

247
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:32,167
Maybe I'm just too hot for them.

248
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,208
You know?

249
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:34,875
Too hot.

250
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:36,750
Isn't Arjun hot for you?

251
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:41,083
No, he's… he's so hot.
I mean he's so gorgeous.

252
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,542
Maybe I was tense.

253
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,333
Performance pressure, right?

254
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:51,583
And thanks to you, you were in my head,
sitting on the bed.

255
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,333
God!

256
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,500
You know what, Grandma? I'm--

257
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,042
I'm happy, I'm good.

258
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,375
Mount Fuji doesn't
have to erupt every day.

259
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:08,917
I'm not worried about you.

260
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,917
I'm worried for Arjun.

261
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,833
He's sensitive.

262
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:20,125
He wouldn't be able to turn around and
sleep soundly like 90 percent of men if…

263
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,042
his partner is left unsatisfied.

264
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,375
He'll try to find faults within himself.

265
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,917
How would he know if was left unsatisfied?

266
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,250
He thinks… I… erupted.

267
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:40,667
Then…

268
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,792
this marriage is going to be really sad.

269
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:57,292
<i>Those who seek pearls must dive deep</i>

270
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:01,500
<i>With drowsy eyes deprived of sleep</i>

271
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,875
<i>Don't stop rowing, says the boat</i>

272
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:08,667
<i>Keep swimming, stay afloat</i>

273
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,750
<i>Lose all your senses</i>
<i>Let the sun rise in the west</i>

274
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:17,500
<i>Lose your way</i>
<i>And set in the east</i>

275
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,458
<i>Play the game</i>

276
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,167
<i>The game of love, player</i>

277
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,292
<i>Let your body and soul</i>

278
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,417
<i>Swing by the gates of heaven</i>

279
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:27,292
<i>Play the game</i>

280
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:29,250
<i>The game of love, player</i>

281
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:31,167
<i>Let your body and soul</i>

282
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,417
<i>Swing by the gates of heaven</i>

283
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:36,083
<i>Let candles of desire</i>

284
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:40,208
<i>Light up nights in your heart</i>

285
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,125
<i>As creases smile at your sight</i>

286
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,917
<i>Marvel at this maddening delight</i>

287
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Come.

288
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,458
What do I have to say?

289
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,625
I'm here to have some tea.

290
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:04,833
Come!

291
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,083
Grandma--

292
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,167
Where are you off to?

293
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:19,208
Grandma, I didn't want to disturb you.

294
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:21,792
You can't disturb those

295
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,208
who are already disturbed.

296
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:39,917
Grandma…

297
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:42,292
Grandma…

298
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,292
We…

299
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,250
Grandma, we are fine.

300
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,250
Grandma, we are fully on.

301
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,667
We…

302
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,625
Grandma, the two of us…

303
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:20,750
Grandma, everything is great.

304
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:27,625
Grandma…

305
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,833
Grandma, we're in love.

306
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:48,792
Grandma, if you--

307
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,750
Grandma, if you don't want to listen
to us, then we'll go.

308
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,042
Twen--

309
00:22:58,292 --> 00:23:01,417
We've left a suite worth 23,000 rupees
to come and talk to you.

310
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:04,708
Why are you wasting our time, Grandma?

311
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:08,875
Yes! That is it!

312
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:11,250
That is what I wanted to hear.

313
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:13,958
Waste of time.

314
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:19,375
If you feel this is a waste of time,

315
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:24,625
it means you enjoy something so much

316
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:28,375
that you want to waste your time
doing just that.

317
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:36,333
May God keep you insatiable
for each other for life!

318
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,208
Look at him!
He's blushing so much!

319
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:44,917
If you've heard what I heard
from Grandma's mouth, you'd be shocked!

320
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:48,292
He's blushing like a squishy tomato!

321
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:49,625
I feel like…

322
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,208
Grandma, she's always picking fights.

323
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:54,708
I don't think we'll last a year.

324
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:57,292
What hotel are you in?

325
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,042
Do you have a boyfriend?

326
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:04,208
Speak softly,
or he'll come to haunt me at night.

327
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:15,458
If the base is strong,
you'll withstand all kinds of quakes.

328
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:21,208
Don't let it weaken or become boring.
Ever.

329
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,208
What do they call people who use drugs?

330
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:29,750
Junkie?

331
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,333
- Junkie.
- No, they're called something else.

332
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:32,542
- What do they call them?
- Addict?

333
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:33,792
- Yes!
- Addict.

334
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:40,208
Become addicted to each other.

335
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:42,708
And there will be things,

336
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,917
things that pull you apart.

337
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,917
But if the sex is the best,

338
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:52,333
then you guys won't leave each other.

339
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:53,958
The chances of that happening are low.

340
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:56,625
And even if you do part ways,

341
00:24:57,958 --> 00:25:01,917
these memories will
bring you back together.

342
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:06,458
Sex is important for love.

343
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,167
Where are you going for your honeymoon?

344
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:15,667
Grandma?

345
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,917
Do we even need a honeymoon?

346
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,125
I do.

347
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,542
For you.

348
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:23,667
See…

349
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,917
The Fuji eruption on the wedding night…

350
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,292
Don't laugh. Listen carefully.

351
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:36,208
The Fuji erupting on the wedding night
is more special than the Fuji erupting

352
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:40,167
on days and nights before the wedding.

353
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,125
And until that happens,

354
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:48,292
the both of you won't leave this room.

355
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,417
What did you say?

356
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:55,125
This room?

357
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:58,250
Grandma…

358
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:00,375
what is this Mount Fuji?

359
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,375
Made for each other.

360
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:30,042
You've done enough parenting for one life.

361
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:32,208
Now go on a honeymoon!

362
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,208
Make each other.

363
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:39,458
<i>Play the game</i>

364
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,625
<i>The game of love, player</i>

365
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:43,542
<i>Let your body and soul</i>

366
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:45,667
<i>Swing by the gates of heaven</i>

367
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:47,583
<i>Play the game</i>

368
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,500
<i>The game of love, player</i>

369
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,417
<i>Let your body and soul</i>

370
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:53,667
<i>Swing by the gates of heaven</i>

371
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:56,208
<i>Let candles of desire</i>

372
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,167
<i>Light up nights in your heart</i>

373
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,667
<i>As creases smile at your sight</i>

374
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:09,792
<i>Marvel at this maddening delight</i>

375
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,542
<i>Play the game</i>

376
00:27:11,917 --> 00:27:13,583
<i>The game of love, player</i>

377
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,458
<i>Let your body and soul</i>

378
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:17,958
<i>Swing by the gates of heaven</i>

379
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:03,542
Hi, Sammy.

380
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:06,333
<i>Isheeta, you won't believe what Rohan did.</i>

381
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:07,958
What happened?

382
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:09,708
<i>He's gone and applied for that loan.</i>

383
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:11,458
<i>We talked about it for weeks,</i>

384
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:14,250
<i>we decided together</i>
<i>that this is not a good time.</i>

385
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:17,500
<i>And this morning, he casually informs me</i>
<i>that he's applied for it!</i>

386
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:19,958
<i>I mean, what's the point then?</i>
<i>Am I supposed to ignore this too?</i>

387
00:28:21,292 --> 00:28:22,500
<i>It's not a small amount, babe.</i>

388
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:26,292
<i>And I don't understand why do we have</i>
<i>to have the latest model of the damn car!</i>

389
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:28,917
<i>It's so unnecessary!</i>
<i>Ish, I'm so angry I can't tell you!</i>

390
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,417
Yeah, I can understand.

391
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:32,292
<i>It's totally gonna fuck up my finances.</i>

392
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,583
<i>We just bought the house,</i>

393
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:35,792
<i>And he knows I also have to pay</i>
<i>for Ma's treatment also.</i>

394
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,656
<i>And the last thing I need</i>
<i>is another EMI!</i>

395
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:40,167
<i>Why are you sounding so low? All okay?</i>

396
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,833
Same old migraine.

397
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:43,667
<i>Oh, no! Again?</i>

398
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:48,625
<i>Ish, you have to try that acupressure guy,</i>
<i>just trust me.</i>

399
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,708
Yeah, I guess.

400
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:51,833
<i>Yeah.</i>

401
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:54,708
Listen, I've reached home.

402
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,292
<i>Yeah, okay, you go rest.</i>
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

403
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:59,083
- Yeah, okay, bye!
<i>- Okay, bye!</i>

404
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:42,708
<i>- Hi, Ish.</i>
- Hi, Sammy…

405
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:44,875
<i>- What?</i>
- You won't believe what has happened.

406
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,250
<i>- What?</i>
- I just walked in and Didi is…

407
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:51,958
- Didi is…
<i>- What? I can't hear you!</i>

408
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,042
She's having sex inside.

409
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:56,417
<i>Didi? Who Didi?</i>

410
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,375
Seema Didi!

411
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:00,250
<i>- What?</i>
- Yeah.

412
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,458
<i>Inside? You mean inside the house?</i>

413
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:04,625
On my bed.

414
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:06,333
<i>What the fuck!</i>

415
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:08,333
Why are you shouting?

416
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:11,875
<i>What the fuck, Ish!</i>
<i>That is disgusting. That is sick.</i>

417
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:15,542
I know, I just froze and I ran out.

418
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:17,625
<i>You ran out?</i>

419
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:19,500
<i>Are they still in there?</i>

420
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:20,875
Yeah.

421
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,375
<i>And where are you?</i>

422
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,208
On the landing.

423
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,667
<i>Babe, are you mad?</i>

424
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:30,958
<i>It's your house.</i>
<i>Your maid is in your bed.</i>

425
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:32,833
<i>You go back inside right now and fire her!</i>

426
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:34,792
Listen, Sammy, I can't.

427
00:30:35,522 --> 00:30:36,833
I just can't deal with this right now.

428
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:41,042
My head is… killing me.

429
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:43,625
<i>Listen, you go inside,</i>
<i>otherwise I'm coming there. I mean it.</i>

430
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,792
<i>Fuck, Seema! And with whom?</i>

431
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:47,208
<i>Do you think she's having an affair?</i>

432
00:30:47,292 --> 00:30:48,208
I don't know.

433
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:50,750
- Oh, they're coming out. I have to go.
<i>- Okay.</i>

434
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:01,833
<i>Close the door.</i>

435
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:06,000
- Didi…
- I bought fresh eggplants for lunch.

436
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:07,375
Ma'am, did you call the plumber yet?

437
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:11,208
- No, I forgot about--
- I've reminded you so many times already.

438
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:14,375
- I was caught up with work yesterday.
- Yeah, it was the same day before as well.

439
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,792
That tap is more like a fountain now!

440
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:17,708
I got drenched
while doing the dishes yesterday.

441
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:19,792
- The watchman told me that Thursday--
- Didi, yesterday...

442
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:25,792
Wha… What is it, ma'am?

443
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:33,667
…you left the window open!

444
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:37,875
No.

445
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:40,125
I shut all the windows while leaving.

446
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,250
The bathroom window was open.

447
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,000
Right?

448
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,250
Bathroom?

449
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,000
There were so many mosquitoes in here!

450
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:50,167
Dinner didn't taste good either!

451
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:51,625
Same old okra everyday!

452
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,167
Go more asymmetrical, okay?

453
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,667
Increase the arches here.

454
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,250
Here…

455
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:11,542
Simplify the notes.

456
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,083
Okay.

457
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:15,167
And print it in maybe a…

458
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:18,667
a thick paper, like maybe 300 GSM,
and show it to me.

459
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:08,417
- Ma'am…
- Ma'am…

460
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:11,250
Yeah.

461
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:14,333
- Tell me.
- Pass that.

462
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:16,083
- See this.
- Yup.

463
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:09,958
Did you pay Saayli's fees?

464
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:12,167
Yes.

465
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:17,542
I went to get the cylinder today.

466
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:19,917
It was too crowded.

467
00:43:20,542 --> 00:43:21,542
I'll get it tomorrow.

468
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:31,417
What happened to you earlier today?

469
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:20,958
<i>Didi, where are you at?</i>

470
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:23,917
<i>It's 9:30 a.m., I need to get to a meeting</i>
<i>and the lunch isn't ready yet.</i>

471
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:25,208
<i>Hurry up, come soon, please.</i>

472
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,875
Sorry, ma'am. I'll be there in five.

473
00:44:35,792 --> 00:44:37,333
Why aren't you in school today?

474
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:42,458
Up there! Didi!

475
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:44,167
There's something wrong with me, you know?

476
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:47,875
Last couple of months, I've been getting
these pounding headaches in the afternoon.

477
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:49,542
Migraines, you know?

478
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:52,667
So, my friend's mother told me about
this amazing acupuncture guy…

479
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:55,667
who fixed her in just two sessions.

480
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:57,875
It's very difficult to get
an appointment from him, you know?

481
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,708
So I have to go again today.

482
00:46:02,042 --> 00:46:03,208
Okay, no worries.

483
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:04,708
Great.

484
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,458
Ma'am, how come you're back early today?

485
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:42,042
No.

486
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,667
See, I called the plumber myself!

487
00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:47,458
Very good.

488
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,208
Actually, I…

489
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:53,042
forgot my charger.
So I'll just get that.

490
00:46:53,292 --> 00:46:54,583
Ma'am, it's done.
Please check it.

491
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:44,083
Hey, listen.

492
00:47:47,792 --> 00:47:49,083
Shave before you come tomorrow.

493
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:10,667
- Someone's out there.
- No.

494
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,292
- Wear your clothes.
- Now--

495
00:48:12,375 --> 00:48:13,375
- Let's go.
- No one's there.

496
00:48:13,667 --> 00:48:14,708
Listen to me…

497
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:15,667
Stop!

498
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:16,833
- I heard something.
- Just wait.

499
00:48:16,917 --> 00:48:17,875
Just listen to me.

500
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:19,000
Who's there?

501
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:32,042
What is going on in my house?

502
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
What is going on?

503
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:37,167
What do you mean?

504
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:39,875
What's going on out here?

505
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:41,333
- What?
- You…

506
00:48:42,417 --> 00:48:44,708
You were hiding here and watching us?

507
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:45,792
Shut up!

508
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:47,208
Why should I shut up?

509
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:48,917
Aren't you ashamed?

510
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:51,042
You were hiding here and watching us?

511
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:52,750
Her pants are undone, look!

512
00:48:52,917 --> 00:48:54,708
- What a disgusting woman!
- What?

513
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,875
- What nonsense!
- Seema, keep quiet…

514
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:00,792
You are the one doing
disgusting things on my bed…

515
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:02,333
and then you dare to accuse me!

516
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,167
What is so disgusting?

517
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:06,208
Whatever it is,
I'm doing it with my own husband!

518
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,667
Unlike you, who's getting off
on watching others do it.

519
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:09,750
What a slutty woman, my god!

520
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,583
- How dare you call me a slut?
- Seema, keep quiet! Have you gone mad?

521
00:49:11,717 --> 00:49:12,675
Who are you calling a slut?

522
00:49:13,697 --> 00:49:16,250
You were the one lying naked on
my bed furiously at it! And I am the slut!

523
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:18,292
- And I'm disgusting?
- Sorry, madam.

524
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:21,625
If you want to have sex with your husband
then do it in your own house!

525
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:26,250
- I trusted you with my house key.
- Please let it go, madam.

526
00:49:26,917 --> 00:49:29,375
- You took advantage of my trust.
- How did I take advantage of it?

527
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,375
- What did I do? Did I steal anything?
- Hang on a minute!

528
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:32,958
You gave me the key
for your own convenience…

529
00:49:33,042 --> 00:49:34,917
because your lazy ass can't
open the door in the morning.

530
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,125
- Lower your voice.
- Why should I?

531
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:37,333
Tell her to keep quiet!

532
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:38,958
You gave me the keys
to keep the house clean!

533
00:49:39,047 --> 00:49:41,147
- Keep your voice down.
- You have no clue where anything is kept!

534
00:49:41,242 --> 00:49:42,372
I even wash your fucking panties!

535
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:43,397
Seema, what are you saying?!

536
00:49:43,489 --> 00:49:44,639
What do you mean what am I saying?

537
00:49:44,706 --> 00:49:46,206
She can't talk to me like that
just because it's her house!

538
00:49:46,306 --> 00:49:47,832
You are not doing me any favors!

539
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:50,625
I pay you a salary!

540
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:53,375
And you!

541
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:55,875
Did you take my permission to come here?

542
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:57,500
Did you ask me?

543
00:49:58,792 --> 00:50:01,250
What do I know
who all she brings in here!

544
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:02,542
I don't know!

545
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:03,708
- How dare you!
- What did you say?

546
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:04,792
- What did you say?
- Have you lost it?

547
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:05,750
Should I call the police?

548
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,750
- You'll call the police? Call them!
- Sorry, madam. Please.

549
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:08,750
Why are you sorry?

550
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:10,667
She's blatantly calling me a whore!

551
00:50:10,792 --> 00:50:12,750
- And you're apologising to her?
- Let it go, please.

552
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:14,250
- She was watching us!
- Just calm down!

553
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:15,564
She was watching us in the mirror!

554
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:16,525
What?

555
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:20,667
Me? Watching you?

556
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:22,042
What else were you looking at?

557
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:23,292
Why would I want to watch you!

558
00:50:24,708 --> 00:50:26,625
The very thought repulses me!

559
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:28,958
Disgusting woman.

560
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:31,125
Really?

561
00:50:31,542 --> 00:50:32,542
So now I am repulsive?

562
00:50:33,167 --> 00:50:35,917
I gross you out? I have been cooking
and cleaning for you for years

563
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,250
and now suddenly I gross you out?

564
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:38,833
You weren't disgusted back then?

565
00:50:38,917 --> 00:50:40,000
When I kept your house so clean,

566
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:41,458
just like my own house.

567
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:42,667
You weren't disgusted then?

568
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:45,375
You cannot do a single thing by yourself!

569
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,000
You cannot even find a man for yourself!

570
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:48,958
You even need me to make yourself cum!

571
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:50,625
- Seema!
- Get out!

572
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,833
- Seema, that's enough!
- Get out of my house!

573
00:50:52,958 --> 00:50:54,792
Take your goddamn money and leave!

574
00:50:55,167 --> 00:50:56,417
- Leave.
- Wait!

575
00:50:56,542 --> 00:50:57,667
Give me my purse.

576
00:50:59,292 --> 00:51:00,292
Keep your money.

577
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:01,750
I don't want your job.

578
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:03,375
I don't want your money.

579
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,250
I can easily get ten other jobs.

580
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:07,000
Nobody in my building will hire you.

581
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:12,083
When I go tell them how you were naked,
fucking on my bed!

582
00:51:12,292 --> 00:51:13,167
Go ahead and tell them.

583
00:51:13,542 --> 00:51:14,708
You think I'm going to sit quietly?

584
00:51:15,042 --> 00:51:16,667
I have seen everything with my own eyes!

585
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:19,833
How you sneak in like a little rat,

586
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:22,833
and watch us from behind the plants,
and touch yourself!

587
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:24,125
Every fucking day!

588
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:25,958
And whom do you think people will believe?

589
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,250
You?

590
00:51:28,417 --> 00:51:29,417
Fuck off!

591
00:51:41,042 --> 00:51:42,875
Akash, take this.

592
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:44,417
I want the change back.

593
00:51:49,917 --> 00:51:51,042
See you, Mom.

594
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:56,292
Mom, you're not going to work today?

595
00:51:57,125 --> 00:51:58,125
I'll go in a bit.

596
00:52:04,167 --> 00:52:06,125
Didi, you're late again?

597
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:07,958
Sorry, ma'am. No water supply today.

598
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:11,208
Okay, hurry up, do the dishes.
I'm running late today!

599
00:52:11,292 --> 00:52:13,500
And please clean the fan on Sunday.

600
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:19,375
Ma'am, Seema worked for you
for many years, right?

601
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:22,292
Why did she leave?

602
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:31,958
The watchman said you needed a house help?

603
00:52:32,042 --> 00:52:34,167
Yes. Only for cooking
and doing the dishes.

604
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:36,292
Also, I'm vegan.

605
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:39,625
So, no dairy products at all.

606
00:52:40,208 --> 00:52:41,708
And go easy on the spices.

607
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:44,708
Can you start tomorrow?
9:00 a.m.?

608
00:52:44,792 --> 00:52:45,833
I'll start tomorrow.

609
00:52:46,167 --> 00:52:47,167
Thank you!

610
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:49,625
What?

611
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,333
<i>You didn't fire Seema that day?</i>

612
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:54,000
Actually I was…

613
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:55,167
<i>Babe!</i>

614
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:58,042
<i>You know, I've been hearing all sorts</i>
<i>of crazy things.</i>

615
00:52:58,708 --> 00:52:59,708
Meaning?

616
00:52:59,917 --> 00:53:03,208
<i>So your seventh floor neighbor,</i>
<i>who's in my Bandra Mom's group, you know?</i>

617
00:53:03,542 --> 00:53:05,667
<i>- She's been saying all these crazy--</i>
- What has she been saying?

618
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:09,208
<i>She's been saying,</i>
<i>you were making your maid do stuff</i>

619
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:11,042
<i>- and watching and all…</i>
- What?

620
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,208
<i>Yeah. And then apparently she was</i>
<i>asking for money as well,</i>

621
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:15,833
<i>but then you guys had some big fight</i>

622
00:53:15,917 --> 00:53:18,000
<i>- and everybody in the building heard--</i>
- What did you say?

623
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:19,792
<i>Babe, I didn't even know what to say.</i>

624
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:22,125
<i>Because I haven't even spoken to you.</i>

625
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:23,333
<i>You have just ghosted me.</i>

626
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,125
<i>And I think-- I mean,</i>
<i>did you even fire her?</i>

627
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,250
Sammy, are you nuts?

628
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:29,042
I fired her.

629
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:30,875
And I didn't call you
because I've been busy at work.

630
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:34,667
<i>You know, Ish, there's been something</i>
<i>on my mind and I really wanna ask you,</i>

631
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,625
<i>- so I'm just gonna go ahead and ask you.</i>
- Yeah.

632
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,125
<i>You know when you</i>
<i>and I used to live together,</i>

633
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,667
<i>and Rohan used to come over?</i>

634
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:44,708
<i>You, by any chance, didn't watch</i>

635
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:46,542
<i>- Rohan and me--</i>
- No.

636
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,833
<i>- And how can you even ask me this, Sammy.</i>
<i>- Okay, sorry.</i>

637
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:51,917
<i>Listen, I have to go now.</i>
<i>I'll talk to you later, okay? Bye.</i>

638
00:53:58,292 --> 00:54:00,208
<i>- Please close the door.</i>
- That's her.

639
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:01,458
The one with the maid drama!

640
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:04,500
Who? Her?

641
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:09,833
DESPERATE HAG

642
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:27,583
- Apply that heart filter.
- Wait.

643
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:30,167
See, how cute you look here!

644
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:34,917
Saayli? What's going on?

645
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:36,875
- Mom--
- Take your hands off her!

646
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,417
Dare you touch her!

647
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:39,625
How dare you touch my daughter?!

648
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:41,375
Want me to tell your mom?

649
00:56:42,167 --> 00:56:43,250
Bloody bastard!

650
00:56:43,417 --> 00:56:44,917
- And you, shut up!
- Mom…

651
00:56:45,042 --> 00:56:46,958
What were you doing with this boy, huh?

652
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:48,292
We were discussing exam papers…

653
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:49,583
Give the phone to me.

654
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:51,542
- Unlock it. What were you looking at?
- Mom, sorry.

655
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:53,333
- I'll show you!
- Mom, we were discussing the paper--

656
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:54,792
- Mom, listen--
- What were doing out there?

657
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:55,939
What did you close when I came?

658
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:57,325
- What did you shut?
- Mom!

659
00:57:03,542 --> 00:57:05,458
It's nothing, go to sleep.

660
00:57:08,417 --> 00:57:09,667
Was it necessary to hit her?

661
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:14,458
Want me to congratulate her instead?

662
00:57:17,042 --> 00:57:17,917
Right…

663
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,208
but you could have talked it out.

664
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:21,458
<i>It's 10:30 p.m.</i>

665
00:57:21,792 --> 00:57:24,000
We ran away and got married at her age.

666
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:28,458
Are you going to get her married
to that scumbag?

667
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:29,875
Is he okay for your daughter?

668
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:31,958
Did I say that?

669
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:33,458
Then?

670
00:57:34,042 --> 00:57:36,125
You think you know everything, right?

671
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:40,333
What is wrong and what is right.

672
00:57:43,792 --> 00:57:45,958
Forget it, I don't want to talk to you.

673
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:48,542
Right.

674
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:50,833
I can see that.

675
00:57:52,917 --> 00:57:54,417
I have been noticing it
for a couple of days.

676
00:57:56,667 --> 00:57:57,792
You can't bear to look at me

677
00:58:00,417 --> 00:58:01,292
Tell me.

678
00:58:02,458 --> 00:58:03,667
Do I disgust you?

679
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:07,375
What did I do wrong? Tell me!

680
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,500
Don't touch me!

681
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:11,625
Did I steal something?

682
00:58:12,667 --> 00:58:14,208
Did I sleep with someone else?

683
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:20,083
What do you think?

684
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:22,333
You haven't done anything wrong?

685
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:27,208
And what about what she did?
Didn't she do anything wrong?

686
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:30,333
They're rich people!

687
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:37,292
It is my fault.

688
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:40,458
I shouldn't have gone there.

689
00:58:41,625 --> 00:58:45,000
Not once or twice but every day?

690
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:47,083
It is not your fault.

691
00:58:47,417 --> 00:58:48,833
She knew everything.

692
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:51,333
She didn't have a problem with it.
She knew!

693
00:58:57,208 --> 00:58:58,208
So…

694
00:58:58,625 --> 00:58:59,625
So she knew everything.

695
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:02,417
You knew everything.

696
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,750
And me?

697
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:09,792
Shouldn't you have told me?

698
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,458
If she was there every time then why...

699
00:59:21,833 --> 00:59:23,083
It turned you on?

700
00:59:28,625 --> 00:59:30,500
The fact that she came every day
and watched us…

701
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,542
it turned you on.

702
00:59:37,042 --> 00:59:38,250
Tell me.

703
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,500
That excited you, right?

704
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,375
Tell me.

705
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:51,458
Tell me.

706
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:56,167
What are you doing? Someone might see.

707
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:58,167
So?

708
00:59:59,792 --> 01:00:01,042
Now you're feeling shy?

709
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,958
How much for the broccoli?

710
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:31,250
Fifty rupees for 100 grams.

711
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:32,875
Give me half a kilo, please.

712
01:00:35,167 --> 01:00:36,833
Broccoli is 400 rupees a kilo.

713
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:39,000
Give me some okra, half a kilo and…

714
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:41,958
Hand me fresh ones.
The ones here are not good.

715
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:46,375
Eggplant…

716
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Put in the eggplant.

717
01:01:01,542 --> 01:01:03,000
- How are you?
- Saayli's exams…

718
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:06,875
Are they done?

719
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,083
The exams are next month.

720
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,333
- But she hardly studies.
- Why?

721
01:01:12,458 --> 01:01:16,375
She is always on her phone,
chatting with boys.

722
01:01:16,667 --> 01:01:20,083
- After all, she is at that age…
- Yeah.

723
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:25,458
- How much?
- Hundred rupees.

724
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:40,750
Did you find a maid?

725
01:01:46,417 --> 01:01:47,417
Did you find a job?

726
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,125
Yes, got two of them.

727
01:01:57,583 --> 01:01:58,583
Actually…

728
01:01:58,875 --> 01:01:59,875
I…

729
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:04,000
thought a lot about calling you.

730
01:02:06,083 --> 01:02:08,917
I tried as well… to tell you.

731
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:15,958
Actually, I should have just told you
that I was…

732
01:02:18,792 --> 01:02:19,792
watching…

733
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:24,292
you and your--

734
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:26,042
I knew it already.

735
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:33,917
Why did you not…

736
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,125
tell me?

737
01:02:44,167 --> 01:02:46,167
Because I enjoyed it too.

738
01:02:48,792 --> 01:02:49,792
Take this, ma'am.

739
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,167
Two hundred rupees.

740
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,250
Okay.

741
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:21,792
- See you.
- Bye.

742
01:03:29,542 --> 01:03:30,542
Tomorrow…

743
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:34,042
should I come?

744
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:51,167
The keys…

745
01:04:56,458 --> 01:05:00,125
<i>Whenever something goes wrong</i>

746
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:04,042
<i>Whenever there's a problem</i>

747
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:08,000
<i>Stand by me, oh companion</i>

748
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,625
<i>- Whenever something goes wrong</i>
<i>- The rest of it… when you reach.</i>

749
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:15,708
No, Nisha, you can't stop.

750
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:21,875
One minute.

751
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:25,917
Now what?

752
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:28,375
<i>Senior has called for an emergency AGM</i>

753
01:05:28,667 --> 01:05:30,167
What? How's that possible?

754
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,042
He can't do that without me, I am the CEO.

755
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:33,667
<i>Well, he has.</i>

756
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:35,833
<i>The ED is up our ass, Vijay.</i>

757
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:39,667
<i>I kept telling you not to deal</i>
<i>with the Malaysians, stay away from them.</i>

758
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:41,042
<i>But you wouldn't listen, would you?</i>

759
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:45,208
Bro, whatever I've done so far has been
for this company. Not for myself.

760
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:47,197
<i>Clearly, Senior doesn't feel that way</i>

761
01:05:47,297 --> 01:05:49,708
<i>And maybe after today's board meeting,</i>
<i>even the board may agree with him.</i>

762
01:05:49,792 --> 01:05:51,167
<i>Just get your ass back here!</i>

763
01:05:51,917 --> 01:05:52,917
<i>Also, where are you?</i>

764
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:54,625
Site visit.

765
01:05:56,333 --> 01:05:57,333
I'll call you in a bit.

766
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:04,042
<i>How far are you?</i>
<i>When are you getting here?</i>

767
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,500
Yes, I…

768
01:06:07,958 --> 01:06:09,042
Nisha, give me a minute.

769
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,500
<i>Papa!</i>

770
01:06:15,042 --> 01:06:16,833
Hey, buddy! What are you doing?

771
01:06:17,167 --> 01:06:20,583
<i>Reading </i>Famous Five,
<i>But I'm not the one reading it.</i>

772
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:23,333
<i>Mom's reading. I am hearing.</i>

773
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,583
<i>It's not hearing, it's listening.</i>

774
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:28,333
- Bud--
<i>- Papa, when are you coming?</i>

775
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:29,417
Soon, buddy.

776
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,667
Let me talk to Mommy.

777
01:06:30,917 --> 01:06:31,958
<i>Okay, Papa.</i>

778
01:06:34,542 --> 01:06:35,958
What the fuck is wrong with your father?

779
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:38,375
For what joy has he called an AGM?

780
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:41,000
<i>I don't know either.</i>
<i>Got a call an hour ago.</i>

781
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:43,125
And you're going?

782
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:46,458
<i>I'm a member of the Board, Vijay.</i>
<i>I'll have to go.</i>

783
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:49,875
Listen, remind your father

784
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,792
that his company was nothing,
till I built it for him.

785
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:54,417
It was worth nothing before that.
How dare he fucking doubt my intentions?

786
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:57,625
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Why don't you ask him yourself?</i>

787
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,625
<i>You're getting a lot of calls.</i>

788
01:07:06,917 --> 01:07:09,250
Nisha, listen, I need to go back…

789
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:11,667
<i>What? No way! You promised me!</i>

790
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,958
I know.

791
01:07:13,208 --> 01:07:14,583
But something important has come up.

792
01:07:16,208 --> 01:07:17,708
<i>More important than this?</i>

793
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:22,583
Hey!

794
01:07:44,667 --> 01:07:45,917
Are you fucking blind?

795
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,208
Me? Sir, you came into my lane!

796
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:31,667
Sir, this is my village.
You'll find a mechanic here.

797
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,250
Thank you.

798
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:45,792
Sir, you have a vintage car.

799
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:47,375
In case you need
a new part then I cannot--

800
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:48,792
Just go and take a look.

801
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:50,500
Let's go.

802
01:08:51,417 --> 01:08:52,625
Is there a phone here?

803
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:01,750
It's dead. Since last two months.

804
01:09:02,417 --> 01:09:03,417
What the…!

805
01:09:04,375 --> 01:09:06,042
Fuck it, just go ahead.
I'm getting late.

806
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:08,875
Is there a coffee shop around?

807
01:09:16,667 --> 01:09:17,542
Hello!

808
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:34,250
<i>There isn't anyone, there never was</i>

809
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:37,500

01:11:18,917 --> 01:11:19,917
Excuse me?

828
01:11:21,833 --> 01:11:23,292
The fuck! Shanti, you're alive!

829
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,500
I'm Vijay.

830
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:28,167
Sorry…

831
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:30,417
- I think you're mistaken.
- Balls, I'm mistaken!

832
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:32,250
I can recognize you anywhere!

833
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:36,000
You should leave.

834
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:37,625
You're making a mistake.

835
01:11:38,125 --> 01:11:39,000
A mistake?

836
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:41,667
Okay, tell me, what's your name?

837
01:11:48,167 --> 01:11:49,167
I'm sorry!

838
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:50,875
I'm really sorry!

839
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
It's okay.

840
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:05,083
What's the matter?

841
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:06,917
Why are you behaving this way?

842
01:12:07,375 --> 01:12:08,375
Is there a problem here?

843
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,333
Is this man troubling you?

844
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:16,500
- Why would I--
- Did I ask you?

845
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:17,875
No.

846
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:18,958
No, right?

847
01:12:19,625 --> 01:12:21,125
Good. So, shut up.

848
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:25,375
Tell me, Shanti.
Is he troubling you?

849
01:12:26,292 --> 01:12:27,792
- Yes!
- Yes?

850
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:30,708
No, the yes was for something else.
I remembered something.

851
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:34,375
Not, "Yes, I am troubling her".
This is different.

852
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:37,667
It's okay, Inder. I know him.

853
01:12:38,375 --> 01:12:39,667
- He's not troubling me.
- Exactly.

854
01:12:40,042 --> 01:12:40,917
Sure?

855
01:12:41,167 --> 01:12:43,208
- Didn't you hear her?
- Did I not tell you to shut up?

856
01:12:44,542 --> 01:12:46,458
Who are you? What's your name?

857
01:12:47,542 --> 01:12:49,167
Vijay. Vijay Chauhan.

858
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:51,458
Vijay Chauhan?

859
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:52,625
Yes, full name.

860
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,625
What are you doing in my town?

861
01:12:58,792 --> 01:12:59,958
Your town?

862
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,083
My car broke down.

863
01:13:05,875 --> 01:13:08,042
I'll see you in the evening?

864
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:10,833
And you…

865
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:15,625
get your car repaired,
and get out of here.

866
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:17,833
I shouldn't see you here in the evening.

867
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:20,250
Hey, you can't talk to me that way.

868
01:13:24,458 --> 01:13:25,833
I'm telling you for your own good.

869
01:13:27,125 --> 01:13:28,125
Leave this place.

870
01:13:34,792 --> 01:13:36,000
He talks so strangely!

871
01:13:37,125 --> 01:13:39,833
Who talks like that?
He is right. You should leave.

872
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:42,583
I will.

873
01:13:44,417 --> 01:13:47,208
After you tell me
why you left me ten years ago.

874
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:52,792
I looked everywhere for you.
I was going out of my mind.

875
01:13:54,167 --> 01:13:55,458
You just vanished!

876
01:13:56,292 --> 01:13:57,708
That was ten years ago, Vijay.

877
01:13:57,792 --> 01:14:00,042
And for ten years I didn't know
where my wife was,

878
01:14:00,292 --> 01:14:01,875
whether she was alive or not.

879
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:04,583
And you're here!

880
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:08,375
Listen…

881
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:12,958
you owe me an explanation.

882
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:18,833
Sorry.

883
01:14:19,792 --> 01:14:20,792
Old habits.

884
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:25,000
I need to change.

885
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:26,750
Will you wait?

886
01:14:28,167 --> 01:14:29,083
Yes.

887
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:31,708
- Do you have coffee?
- Yes.

888
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:34,500
The kettle is there,
and the coffee right above.

889
01:14:35,042 --> 01:14:36,042
And milk?

890
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:39,292
Since when did you
start taking milk with your coffee?

891
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:42,542
Just checking if you still remember.

892
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,917
Vijay, can you turn that tap off, please?

893
01:14:58,875 --> 01:15:00,125
I'm not getting water here.

894
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:03,875
Doesn't this remind you
of our flat in Malad?

895
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:05,542
Only one tap at a time.

896
01:16:10,542 --> 01:16:11,792
What the fuck?!

897
01:16:25,417 --> 01:16:26,333
For you.

898
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:27,625
I don't drink coffee.

899
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:28,792
I know.

900
01:16:29,083 --> 01:16:30,458
Tea… with milk.

901
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:38,750
So, tell me…

902
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:40,750
You should get going.

903
01:16:41,417 --> 01:16:42,500
Or you'll be late.

904
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,958
I have a meeting, but it can wait.

905
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:49,083
Vijay Chauhan late for a meeting?

906
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:50,708
You're never late.

907
01:16:51,792 --> 01:16:53,375
Well, there is always a first time.

908
01:16:55,333 --> 01:16:56,333
Now, tell me!

909
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,417
I don't remember everything.

910
01:17:03,958 --> 01:17:05,958
I was coming back from the nursing home.

911
01:17:06,125 --> 01:17:07,458
<i>I met someone on the road.</i>

912
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:09,458
<i>He was looking for the nursing home.</i>

913
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:12,833
<i>His pregnant wife was in the car.</i>
<i>She was in labor.</i>

914
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:17,208
<i>She was screaming in pain,</i>
<i>so I went there to help her and…</i>

915
01:17:17,542 --> 01:17:18,417
<i>then…</i>

916
01:17:18,917 --> 01:17:19,792
Then?

917
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:22,167
I don't remember anything after that.

918
01:17:22,875 --> 01:17:26,583
What I do remember is
that I was here, in Paraisol.

919
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:28,917
Why didn't you come back home?

920
01:17:29,583 --> 01:17:30,875
You didn't even call me once.

921
01:17:32,375 --> 01:17:33,375
I was scared.

922
01:17:33,958 --> 01:17:34,958
Of what?

923
01:17:36,583 --> 01:17:37,917
I was scared that…

924
01:17:38,625 --> 01:17:40,917
Someone was trying to kill me.

925
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:42,458
To kill you?

926
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:46,167
Why would someone want to kill you?

927
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I don't know.

928
01:17:48,958 --> 01:17:50,417
I was really scared and…

929
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,583
I thought of calling you,

930
01:17:54,417 --> 01:17:55,708
but I didn't have the courage.

931
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:00,458
No one wants to kill you.

932
01:18:01,292 --> 01:18:02,667
How can you think so?

933
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:05,875
Nursing home?

934
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:08,167
You said you were returning
from the nursing home?

935
01:18:08,542 --> 01:18:09,792
Why did you go to the nursing home?

936
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:14,417
Were you pregnant?

937
01:18:14,792 --> 01:18:15,792
I'm sorry.

938
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:19,292
I wanted to surprise you.

939
01:18:20,625 --> 01:18:21,750
We were gonna have a baby?

940
01:18:23,292 --> 01:18:24,542
I lost our baby.

941
01:18:25,458 --> 01:18:26,875
It was all my fault.

942
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:29,208
I shouldn't have gone to that car.

943
01:18:30,125 --> 01:18:32,333
- It's okay.
- I should have told you everything.

944
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:33,625
It's okay.

945
01:18:33,833 --> 01:18:35,000
It would have been so--

946
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:08,292
No, we can't do this.

947
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:10,667
This is wrong.

948
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:12,625
What's wrong in this?

949
01:19:12,792 --> 01:19:13,958
You're my wife.

950
01:19:17,667 --> 01:19:18,792
So, you didn't remarry?

951
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:23,750
With whom?

952
01:19:26,167 --> 01:19:27,208
Anita.

953
01:19:27,667 --> 01:19:28,667
Anita?

954
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:31,000
Anu?

955
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:32,875
Our Anu?

956
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:36,042
Wow!

957
01:19:36,917 --> 01:19:38,333
So you married Anita?

958
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:40,583
Everything happened so quickly.

959
01:19:41,792 --> 01:19:43,125
After you left…

960
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:44,958
I was a mess.

961
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:46,542
And she was there for me.

962
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:49,042
Kids?

963
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:50,500
Two boys.

964
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,125
Eight and five.

965
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:55,125
So sweet.

966
01:19:56,083 --> 01:20:00,042
I still remember, when Anu
and you joined that company together.

967
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:01,625
What was the term?

968
01:20:02,042 --> 01:20:03,833
Graduate Management Trainees.

969
01:20:07,708 --> 01:20:10,042
And that first day
when Anu came over…

970
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:15,292
I thought that she was
the prettiest girl in the whole world.

971
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:16,792
Is it?

972
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:21,875
Jealousy?

973
01:20:23,917 --> 01:20:24,958
A little, in the beginning.

974
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:28,292
But I knew you were only mine.

975
01:20:29,042 --> 01:20:31,500
I even had the marriage certificate
to prove it.

976
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:35,042
You're right.

977
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,333
I was always yours.

978
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Nice tea.

979
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:41,625
And I still am.

980
01:20:46,833 --> 01:20:48,500
You look different.

981
01:20:50,042 --> 01:20:51,042
Well…

982
01:20:51,167 --> 01:20:52,667
What happened to Anu's fiance?

983
01:20:52,917 --> 01:20:55,292
The one who was going to take over
the company after they got married.

984
01:20:58,542 --> 01:20:59,417
I don't know.

985
01:20:59,667 --> 01:21:00,750
We'd only met a couple of times.

986
01:21:01,625 --> 01:21:03,500
Once we met them together, remember?

987
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:05,958
So, who's running the company now?

988
01:21:07,125 --> 01:21:08,292
Oh, hello.

989
01:21:10,906 --> 01:21:12,208
The one standing right in front of you.

990
01:21:13,792 --> 01:21:15,292
I'm so proud of you.

991
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:17,833
All you've wanted since college was this.

992
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:20,542
And look, you got it.

993
01:21:21,292 --> 01:21:23,042
It was impossible to do so without you.

994
01:21:24,667 --> 01:21:26,208
You sacrificed so much!

995
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:28,250
- Managed the house so that I--
- No!

996
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:30,833
Managing the house was my choice.

997
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:33,000
I was happy doing that.

998
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:37,125
Whatever I am today,
is all because of you.

999
01:21:38,792 --> 01:21:39,792
Thank you.

1000
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:46,500
Vijay!

1001
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:48,542
You've not changed at all!

1002
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,417
Jumping at every opportunity.

1003
01:21:52,208 --> 01:21:53,500
How does Anu keep up with you?

1004
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:55,042
Very happily.

1005
01:21:58,625 --> 01:21:59,667
You should leave.

1006
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,250
You'll be late.

1007
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:02,750
Yeah, I am getting late.

1008
01:22:06,792 --> 01:22:07,750
Listen…

1009
01:22:08,375 --> 01:22:09,625
you're coming with me.

1010
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:12,292
Why? No.

1011
01:22:12,417 --> 01:22:13,417
Why not?

1012
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:16,083
Anu will be so happy to see you.

1013
01:22:19,458 --> 01:22:20,708
She wouldn't be happy.

1014
01:22:21,167 --> 01:22:22,167
Why?

1015
01:22:23,417 --> 01:22:25,375
You still don't get it, Vijay?

1016
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:27,375
It was Anu.

1017
01:22:27,792 --> 01:22:28,792
What was Anu?

1018
01:22:29,458 --> 01:22:31,208
She was the one who hired those people.

1019
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:32,667
That couple.

1020
01:22:33,417 --> 01:22:35,083
The one near the nursing home.

1021
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:37,125
They were the ones who tried to kill me.

1022
01:22:37,292 --> 01:22:38,667
What nonsense is this!

1023
01:22:39,042 --> 01:22:40,208
Are you out of your mind?

1024
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:44,417
Anu loved you from the day she met you.

1025
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:45,417
No.

1026
01:22:45,667 --> 01:22:48,667
No, Shanti! The three
of us were best friends.

1027
01:22:49,083 --> 01:22:50,333
The three fucking musketeers!

1028
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,250
Anu always wanted you for herself.

1029
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:56,542
She always tried
to divert your attention off of me.

1030
01:22:57,208 --> 01:22:59,417
And the day she found
out that I was pregnant…

1031
01:22:59,917 --> 01:23:01,167
- she just--
- One minute…

1032
01:23:02,208 --> 01:23:04,083
How did Anu find out
that you were pregnant?

1033
01:23:04,417 --> 01:23:05,708
She's never told me anything.

1034
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:07,875
What was she going to say?

1035
01:23:08,792 --> 01:23:10,208
Remember the evening we had

1036
01:23:10,292 --> 01:23:11,458
the dinner

1037
01:23:11,917 --> 01:23:14,167
and we were all singing
<i>"Jab Koi Baat Bigad Jaye"?</i>

1038
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:15,333
No. Go on.

1039
01:23:16,375 --> 01:23:17,875
That's the evening I did my test.

1040
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:20,083
By mistake I left the

1041
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:21,250
test kit in the washroom.

1042
01:23:21,792 --> 01:23:23,750
I didn't want anyone else to know.

1043
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:25,750
So I instantly went back to check for it.

1044
01:23:26,125 --> 01:23:28,792
And I saw Anu coming
out of the washroom.

1045
01:23:29,208 --> 01:23:30,208
So?

1046
01:23:30,417 --> 01:23:34,333
Vijay, I had kept the test kit face up
inside the washroom.

1047
01:23:34,792 --> 01:23:37,208
But when I went back in there,
the test kit was kept face down.

1048
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:40,792
That means, Anu saw it
and accidentally put it back upside down.

1049
01:23:40,875 --> 01:23:42,625
Even if she did see it…

1050
01:23:48,333 --> 01:23:49,333
Fuck!

1051
01:23:52,042 --> 01:23:56,042
Actually, after you left,
Anu didn't leave me alone for a second.

1052
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,167
I thought she was
genuinely concerned, but…

1053
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:04,375
Such things require a lot of money,

1054
01:24:05,042 --> 01:24:06,792
the kinds she has in plenty.

1055
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:09,292
We need to do something about this.

1056
01:24:09,708 --> 01:24:10,750
No, we don't.

1057
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:11,958
Sorry?

1058
01:24:12,875 --> 01:24:14,125
Vijay, you're happy, right?

1059
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:15,958
With Anu and your kids?

1060
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:18,792
Yes.

1061
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,167
Then let things be.

1062
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:22,167
Return home.

1063
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:23,708
Back to your family.

1064
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:25,417
There's still time.

1065
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,083
Please go.

1066
01:24:27,167 --> 01:24:28,167
And forget all of this?

1067
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:30,083
Whatever you've told me?

1068
01:24:31,125 --> 01:24:32,208
Try to.

1069
01:24:33,542 --> 01:24:35,458
Or else, your life
will become a living hell.

1070
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:37,250
Listen to me.

1071
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:38,750
Please leave.

1072
01:24:41,333 --> 01:24:42,750
I know it's been quite a few years,

1073
01:24:43,583 --> 01:24:46,125
but do you remember
the faces of the couple you met?

1074
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:48,667
Yes.

1075
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,375
Seriously? Till now?

1076
01:24:51,375 --> 01:24:52,667
Fresh like it happened yesterday.

1077
01:24:54,042 --> 01:24:54,958
Superb.

1078
01:24:56,208 --> 01:24:59,917
If we find them, we can get closer
to the truth. We'll know the truth.

1079
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:02,625
What will you do by knowing the truth?

1080
01:25:03,583 --> 01:25:05,375
And what if Anu has done all of this?

1081
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:07,083
Then she must be punished.

1082
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:08,625
And then?

1083
01:25:11,458 --> 01:25:14,583
And then, maybe, we can live together.

1084
01:25:15,083 --> 01:25:16,042
Again.

1085
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,625
I missed you so much!

1086
01:25:21,542 --> 01:25:22,458
No.

1087
01:25:23,458 --> 01:25:24,625
No, we can't.

1088
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:25,958
You should leave.

1089
01:25:26,833 --> 01:25:27,875
You have a wife now.

1090
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:29,333
Because of whom I lost you.

1091
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:31,292
We can't do this.

1092
01:25:32,792 --> 01:25:33,792
Please leave.

1093
01:25:34,042 --> 01:25:36,292
Listen, I'm with Inder now.

1094
01:25:56,583 --> 01:25:57,667
Were they this big before?

1095
01:25:58,042 --> 01:25:59,125
Focus on the job.

1096
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:51,958
Vijay, careful.

1097
01:26:52,625 --> 01:26:53,625
Careful!

1098
01:27:20,375 --> 01:27:22,375
- Vijay, did you--
- Sorry, I lost control.

1099
01:27:25,542 --> 01:27:28,625
The last time you lost control,
I was the one who got pregnant.

1100
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:31,208
And then, straight here.

1101
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:33,750
Don't worry, you won't get pregnant.

1102
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:35,750
How do you know?

1103
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:37,333
I just do.

1104
01:27:39,167 --> 01:27:43,083
If you have doubts,
then try your Red Blue thing. You'll know.

1105
01:27:45,333 --> 01:27:46,542
Same old Vijay.

1106
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:48,750
I know everything.

1107
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:52,375
Correct!

1108
01:27:58,542 --> 01:27:59,625
Red Blue?

1109
01:28:01,875 --> 01:28:02,875
How do you know?

1110
01:28:03,583 --> 01:28:04,583
What Red Blue?

1111
01:28:05,708 --> 01:28:06,708
That test kit.

1112
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:08,792
The one Anu found.

1113
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:11,083
It's called Red Blue.

1114
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:15,458
My friend got it from Canada.

1115
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:17,708
That brand isn't available in India.

1116
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:19,958
I hadn't told anyone about it.

1117
01:28:20,708 --> 01:28:21,875
How did you know?

1118
01:28:22,417 --> 01:28:23,500
You must have told me.

1119
01:28:24,125 --> 01:28:25,208
I hadn't told you this.

1120
01:28:32,667 --> 01:28:33,667
Did Anu tell you?

1121
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:38,833
No, Anu didn't tell me.

1122
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:43,708
That means…

1123
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:46,500
it was you.

1124
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:49,375
Vijay! Vijay!

1125
01:28:49,542 --> 01:28:51,958
- Help!
- I gave those fuckwads so much money.

1126
01:28:52,042 --> 01:28:53,708
They couldn't even do one job well.

1127
01:28:54,292 --> 01:28:56,167
Moreover, you remember
their faces as well!

1128
01:28:56,583 --> 01:28:59,250
Thank you for not coming back
and staying the fuck away.

1129
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:01,417
Because whatever I am today
is because of you.

1130
01:29:01,625 --> 01:29:03,333
You've sacrificed a lot for me.

1131
01:29:03,708 --> 01:29:05,167
Just this one last time. Please!

1132
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:06,417
Please.

1133
01:29:21,333 --> 01:29:22,542
Fuck, I'm late.

1134
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:29,792
Fuck.

1135
01:29:54,125 --> 01:29:55,167
Shanti?

1136
01:29:57,542 --> 01:29:58,458
Shanti?

1137
01:29:58,833 --> 01:29:59,833
Shanti, are you--

1138
01:30:38,042 --> 01:30:39,500
Tried really hard to wake him up.

1139
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,333
Seems like he didn't want to come back.

1140
01:30:42,667 --> 01:30:44,667
<i>Whenever something goes</i>

1141
01:30:44,792 --> 01:30:48,750
<i>Whenever something goes wrong</i>

1142
01:30:48,875 --> 01:30:51,250
<i>- Whenever something goes wrong</i>
- Something's wrong with the music system.

1143
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:52,542
How do I turn it off?

1144
01:30:53,333 --> 01:30:54,417
Didn't I tell you?

1145
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:57,792
Leave…

1146
01:30:58,792 --> 01:31:00,250
or you'd be late.

1147
01:31:20,667 --> 01:31:23,250
Fucking whore!

1148
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:26,750
Don't move, bitch!

1149
01:33:21,292 --> 01:33:22,292
My Lord,

1150
01:33:22,625 --> 01:33:24,583
you have friends in high places,

1151
01:33:25,958 --> 01:33:27,250
why not request them?

1152
01:33:27,708 --> 01:33:29,708
Hey, we don't go begging for alms.

1153
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,208
We give orders.

1154
01:33:37,083 --> 01:33:39,125
So, my Lord,
will you get the tender this time?

1155
01:33:39,917 --> 01:33:41,208
Absolutely!

1156
01:33:42,625 --> 01:33:45,667
The Collector's mother used to scoop
cow dung at our palace back in the day,

1157
01:33:46,375 --> 01:33:48,042
then help me out as well, my Lord.

1158
01:33:48,583 --> 01:33:50,583
I pick up and drop off the prince
from his tuition every day.

1159
01:33:51,458 --> 01:33:54,542
If I could also get paid…

1160
01:33:56,167 --> 01:33:57,167
Have some patience.

1161
01:33:58,167 --> 01:34:02,250
Once we bag the contract,
you'll get paid too…

1162
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:04,333
In that case,
it will surely be awarded to you!

1163
01:34:07,583 --> 01:34:10,750
What have we got here?

1164
01:34:11,083 --> 01:34:13,750
It's nothing.
Just a sight for sore eyes, my Lord.

1165
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:15,042
I see…

1166
01:34:15,542 --> 01:34:18,042
Distraction can lead to an accident.

1167
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:27,042
{\an8}BIJOKPUR RAJWADA

1168
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:28,167
{\an8}Good day, my Lord.

1169
01:34:28,958 --> 01:34:29,958
{\an8}Drive safe.

1170
01:34:30,083 --> 01:34:31,708
{\an8}Goodbye.

1171
01:34:57,708 --> 01:34:58,875
Ankur.

1172
01:34:59,167 --> 01:35:00,167
Go on, son. I'll join you.

1173
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,083
Bitari.

1174
01:35:05,583 --> 01:35:06,667
You are leaving early today?

1175
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:11,208
My son's running a temperature, my Lord.

1176
01:35:11,542 --> 01:35:13,583
Him, I will give medicine to.

1177
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:16,083
But what do I do with this?

1178
01:35:17,708 --> 01:35:18,833
See… my pants have come undone.

1179
01:35:19,083 --> 01:35:20,083
Come, fix it.

1180
01:35:20,667 --> 01:35:21,667
Please, my Lord, I can't.

1181
01:35:21,917 --> 01:35:22,917
Please, my Lord. Please…

1182
01:35:23,208 --> 01:35:24,208
It'll only take a minute.

1183
01:35:24,375 --> 01:35:28,667
Come, come…

1184
01:35:29,208 --> 01:35:30,792
Please let me go, my Lord…

1185
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:55,958
Here's a fresh one for you.

1186
01:35:56,667 --> 01:35:57,667
I don't want more.

1187
01:35:57,958 --> 01:36:00,167
Put that glass down. Eat first.

1188
01:36:00,542 --> 01:36:01,875
I've prepared your favorite dish.

1189
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:08,250
So, tell me.

1190
01:36:08,839 --> 01:36:10,167
How are your preparations coming along?

1191
01:36:11,708 --> 01:36:12,708
Fine.

1192
01:36:13,958 --> 01:36:14,958
Just fine?

1193
01:36:16,542 --> 01:36:17,750
I hope better than fine?

1194
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
No.

1195
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:24,500
What do you mean by no?

1196
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:27,500
You do want to go to England, right?

1197
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:31,667
I don't want to go to England or anywhere.

1198
01:36:32,542 --> 01:36:33,750
What do you mean you don't want to?

1199
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:35,667
I don't want to.

1200
01:36:39,167 --> 01:36:40,792
You are going to England.

1201
01:36:42,375 --> 01:36:44,292
There is nothing left for you here.

1202
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:46,500
And you?

1203
01:36:47,458 --> 01:36:48,708
If I leave, what about you?

1204
01:36:56,333 --> 01:36:57,333
You don't worry about me.

1205
01:36:59,792 --> 01:37:00,792
See…

1206
01:37:02,042 --> 01:37:04,875
Once you go there, I'll come join you.

1207
01:37:06,542 --> 01:37:07,542
Understood?

1208
01:37:09,375 --> 01:37:11,000
Your hair's become so dry.

1209
01:37:11,292 --> 01:37:12,292
I won't oil my hair.

1210
01:37:17,125 --> 01:37:18,250
Do you know how expensive it is?

1211
01:37:19,792 --> 01:37:21,875
And today, Father went to the city again
for some new tender .

1212
01:37:23,958 --> 01:37:25,375
God knows what he's mortgaged now.

1213
01:37:28,167 --> 01:37:29,167
How do you know?

1214
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:31,167
He's the one telling the world about it.

1215
01:37:39,208 --> 01:37:40,500
You don't have to worry about money.

1216
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:44,208
You just focus on your studies.

1217
01:37:44,375 --> 01:37:45,958
Don't apply oil on my face, Mom!

1218
01:38:48,833 --> 01:38:49,833
Chanda!

1219
01:38:57,333 --> 01:38:58,333
Chanda.

1220
01:39:02,917 --> 01:39:03,917
My queen.

1221
01:39:10,958 --> 01:39:12,042
Are you asleep?

1222
01:39:14,958 --> 01:39:15,958
Are you asleep?

1223
01:39:18,250 --> 01:39:19,917
I have some good news for you,

1224
01:39:21,583 --> 01:39:22,833
do you know…

1225
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:25,458
today, we bagged a big tender.

1226
01:39:27,417 --> 01:39:28,750
Just like last time?

1227
01:39:38,083 --> 01:39:40,833
Bloody… bitch.

1228
01:39:41,667 --> 01:39:42,833
Wretch!

1229
01:39:44,375 --> 01:39:45,375
Whore!

1230
01:40:05,375 --> 01:40:06,375
Bastard!

1231
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:07,458
I'll show you!

1232
01:40:07,708 --> 01:40:08,583
Get out.

1233
01:40:08,667 --> 01:40:10,750
Get up, get out of this place!

1234
01:40:10,875 --> 01:40:12,250
Bastard!

1235
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:13,542
I'll show you!

1236
01:40:13,667 --> 01:40:15,750
Bastard! Think you're a man, huh?

1237
01:40:15,958 --> 01:40:18,083
If I ever see you here again,
I will cut you into pieces.

1238
01:40:18,208 --> 01:40:19,417
Get out of here, get lost!

1239
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:20,500
Go away!

1240
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:21,792
Son of a bitch!

1241
01:40:34,125 --> 01:40:36,125
Who is it?

1242
01:40:36,333 --> 01:40:38,625
- Aunty.
- Bastard, Get out of here.

1243
01:40:38,708 --> 01:40:40,250
Get lost! Go away!

1244
01:40:40,917 --> 01:40:43,042
Bloody animal!

1245
01:40:46,042 --> 01:40:47,667
Come on, back to work.

1246
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:49,042
Yeah…

1247
01:40:50,833 --> 01:40:51,792
Yes, tell me.

1248
01:40:51,875 --> 01:40:52,958
What happened?

1249
01:40:54,625 --> 01:40:56,417
The same old every day shenanigans.

1250
01:40:56,875 --> 01:41:00,125
The worst scum on earth end up here.

1251
01:41:02,583 --> 01:41:05,208
Forget it.
You tell me… what is the matter?

1252
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:06,875
You are still not feeling better?

1253
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:10,000
Don't ask… feels like I'm dying.

1254
01:41:11,417 --> 01:41:12,375
How are you?

1255
01:41:12,875 --> 01:41:13,875
<i>I'm fine.</i>

1256
01:41:15,292 --> 01:41:16,792
<i>Just missing you.</i>

1257
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,625
Right, I know everything.

1258
01:41:21,708 --> 01:41:23,000
When you start missing me.

1259
01:41:24,333 --> 01:41:26,292
You were a real queen
when you were here.

1260
01:41:28,292 --> 01:41:30,500
But he made you a whore in that palace.

1261
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:37,250
If being a whore makes my son the king,

1262
01:41:39,542 --> 01:41:40,625
so be it.

1263
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,250
<i>Did you go see a doctor?</i>

1264
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,125
What will the doctor do?

1265
01:41:47,625 --> 01:41:49,250
When it's time for someone to go…

1266
01:41:52,042 --> 01:41:53,375
they got to go.

1267
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:55,417
Good you got out of here.

1268
01:41:56,875 --> 01:41:58,083
<i>Just yesterday, I found out,</i>

1269
01:41:58,917 --> 01:42:01,167
<i>one of the girls has gotten the disease.</i>

1270
01:42:02,042 --> 01:42:03,917
<i>Don't know which degenerate</i>
<i>gave it to her.</i>

1271
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:06,708
<i>Her life is over</i>
<i>before it even began.</i>

1272
01:42:07,417 --> 01:42:08,583
<i>Fucking idiot.</i>

1273
01:42:10,833 --> 01:42:12,042
You got me drenched!

1274
01:42:12,625 --> 01:42:13,792
Told you to go slow!

1275
01:42:14,708 --> 01:42:16,333
Bastard. Hold me!

1276
01:42:16,875 --> 01:42:18,958
What? What is it?

1277
01:42:19,708 --> 01:42:20,708
What are you doing here?

1278
01:42:21,083 --> 01:42:22,250
My Lord, going to tuition classes.

1279
01:42:22,792 --> 01:42:23,792
Tuition classes.

1280
01:42:26,125 --> 01:42:27,125
Listen. Come here.

1281
01:42:29,583 --> 01:42:31,542
Fucker, if this time
the Prince doesn't score well,

1282
01:42:32,583 --> 01:42:33,708
you'll be the one to fail.

1283
01:42:44,333 --> 01:42:45,333
Let's go.

1284
01:42:56,875 --> 01:42:57,875
Devyani!

1285
01:42:59,917 --> 01:43:01,042
Devyani!

1286
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:02,750
What was he saying?

1287
01:43:04,208 --> 01:43:05,875
He was asking about my stars.

1288
01:43:06,792 --> 01:43:08,042
I told him they are not aligned.

1289
01:43:13,292 --> 01:43:14,500
You've prepped well, right?

1290
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:16,458
What?

1291
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,167
Never mind.

1292
01:43:28,792 --> 01:43:29,750
Those…

1293
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:32,125
hotel representatives had come over again…

1294
01:43:33,583 --> 01:43:35,125
to hold talks with you.

1295
01:43:44,625 --> 01:43:45,958
This palace belongs to Kings.

1296
01:43:47,208 --> 01:43:49,125
It's not your brothel
to turn it into a hotel.

1297
01:43:51,583 --> 01:43:53,417
I've said it once, I won't repeat it.

1298
01:43:55,042 --> 01:43:55,917
Out.

1299
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:10,500
Get out.

1300
01:44:14,917 --> 01:44:16,125
Bitch.

1301
01:45:04,708 --> 01:45:05,708
Bitari.

1302
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:08,208
Morning, my Lord!

1303
01:45:08,417 --> 01:45:09,833
Well, you're not Bitari.

1304
01:45:10,625 --> 01:45:11,625
Are you new?

1305
01:45:12,208 --> 01:45:13,167
Yes, my Lord.

1306
01:45:14,333 --> 01:45:15,417
Go, grab my towel for me.

1307
01:45:16,083 --> 01:45:17,083
Towel?

1308
01:45:28,667 --> 01:45:29,917
One, two…

1309
01:45:30,542 --> 01:45:31,875
and my pawn is safe.

1310
01:45:34,333 --> 01:45:35,458
- Father…
- Yes?

1311
01:45:36,625 --> 01:45:38,292
I want to study further in England.

1312
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:40,167
Why? What's the problem here?

1313
01:45:41,333 --> 01:45:42,542
The education is better there.

1314
01:45:43,333 --> 01:45:44,833
And now you even have the contract.

1315
01:45:45,625 --> 01:45:48,292
So, Mom and I can
go there for a few years.

1316
01:45:56,542 --> 01:45:57,542
Greetings, my Lord.

1317
01:45:58,083 --> 01:45:59,917
My lady has sent your tea.

1318
01:46:02,083 --> 01:46:03,083
Listen…

1319
01:46:04,542 --> 01:46:05,542
what's your name?

1320
01:46:07,167 --> 01:46:08,167
My Lord, Rekha.

1321
01:46:19,208 --> 01:46:20,208
Wrap it up.

1322
01:46:23,333 --> 01:46:26,292
Black clothes, black slippers, black
thread, don't wear anything black.

1323
01:46:26,917 --> 01:46:29,375
You see, your stars are against you.

1324
01:46:29,667 --> 01:46:30,667
A big one.

1325
01:46:30,875 --> 01:46:32,500
Ideally, the rituals are done in Ujjain.

1326
01:46:32,667 --> 01:46:34,625
But I can get it done right here
for Rs.1100, just for you.

1327
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:36,500
What else?

1328
01:46:38,125 --> 01:46:43,292
First thing in the morning,
feed the dogs, crows and five ants.

1329
01:46:43,417 --> 01:46:45,208
- Black ants?
- Absolutely not!

1330
01:46:45,542 --> 01:46:46,625
If you want to go to England,

1331
01:46:46,708 --> 01:46:48,872
then the difference between
black and red is like life and death.

1332
01:46:49,125 --> 01:46:51,042
I wonder why you are
so persistent about going to England.

1333
01:46:51,250 --> 01:46:52,875
Even the sun doesn't rise there
for three months!

1334
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:55,250
I wonder who they pray to in the morning?

1335
01:46:57,131 --> 01:46:58,208
I want to become a big shot.

1336
01:46:58,417 --> 01:47:00,042
How much more big do you want to get?

1337
01:47:00,958 --> 01:47:02,083
As much as your father?

1338
01:47:02,708 --> 01:47:04,875
Bhanu says he's like this
because his blood is white.

1339
01:47:05,708 --> 01:47:07,125
It's not your father's fault…

1340
01:47:07,875 --> 01:47:08,917
His stars…

1341
01:47:09,250 --> 01:47:10,792
His stars are not in the right place.

1342
01:47:11,125 --> 01:47:12,750
I know a ritual
that should be done in Banaras.

1343
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,500
But I can do it here also, just for you,

1344
01:47:14,667 --> 01:47:15,667
only for Rs.2100.

1345
01:47:20,833 --> 01:47:22,042
Your Venus is being influenced.

1346
01:47:23,042 --> 01:47:25,458
As long as you live in that palace,
you will never go to England.

1347
01:47:26,833 --> 01:47:28,208
What do I do to appease Venus?

1348
01:47:30,417 --> 01:47:31,583
There's a long ritual..

1349
01:47:32,333 --> 01:47:34,250
But for now. Take a drag.

1350
01:47:38,083 --> 01:47:39,000
You…

1351
01:47:39,958 --> 01:47:40,958
Rekha!

1352
01:47:41,542 --> 01:47:42,875
Coming, my lady.

1353
01:47:43,250 --> 01:47:44,750
Just finishing the laundry.

1354
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:46,208
Okay, hurry!

1355
01:49:07,167 --> 01:49:09,500
Will you iron this kurta for me?

1356
01:49:10,208 --> 01:49:11,208
There's a meeting in the city.

1357
01:49:13,792 --> 01:49:15,250
Who's the new girl?

1358
01:49:16,292 --> 01:49:18,667
The old one was working well,
why did you let her go?

1359
01:49:20,333 --> 01:49:22,125
I did not. She went away.

1360
01:49:22,833 --> 01:49:26,375
Why? Weren't we paying her?
What else did she want?

1361
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:30,208
We were paying her to work in the kitchen,

1362
01:49:31,625 --> 01:49:32,625
not in the bedroom.

1363
01:49:37,208 --> 01:49:40,125
Learn to be in your limits.

1364
01:49:42,417 --> 01:49:44,792
Or I'll throw you right back
into that hole I picked you from.

1365
01:49:47,875 --> 01:49:48,875
One more thing.

1366
01:49:49,542 --> 01:49:51,958
Stop corrupting the Prince's mind
with thoughts of England.

1367
01:49:55,125 --> 01:49:56,292
He is a King's son.

1368
01:49:58,792 --> 01:50:00,333
And Kings work for no one.

1369
01:50:14,167 --> 01:50:16,333
Such beautiful sarees, my lady.

1370
01:50:20,958 --> 01:50:22,833
They must look so good on you.

1371
01:50:23,875 --> 01:50:24,875
Pick one.

1372
01:50:25,208 --> 01:50:27,917
No, no, my lady.
They wouldn't suit me, would they?

1373
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:29,500
Fine, don't then.

1374
01:50:29,917 --> 01:50:31,208
This one… can I take this one?

1375
01:50:31,333 --> 01:50:33,083
I like this color a lot.

1376
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:35,250
Take it.

1377
01:50:56,458 --> 01:50:57,458
My lady…

1378
01:52:48,917 --> 01:52:50,583
Sons of bitches.

1379
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:52,250
Motherfuckers.

1380
01:52:52,667 --> 01:52:53,667
Bloody…

1381
01:52:55,208 --> 01:52:57,417
Squabbling with me, you asshole!

1382
01:52:58,375 --> 01:53:01,333
Your mother would pick cow dung,
motherfucking Collector.

1383
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:04,292
You swine.

1384
01:53:04,917 --> 01:53:05,917
Bloody…

1385
01:53:07,292 --> 01:53:08,292
Fucking Collector.

1386
01:53:21,833 --> 01:53:22,833
Slept off again?

1387
01:53:28,125 --> 01:53:29,583
How did this conk out again?

1388
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:31,417
Motherfucker.

1389
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:33,875
Nothing ever works in this house.

1390
01:53:35,458 --> 01:53:36,458
Son of a…

1391
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,083
fucking…

1392
01:53:38,458 --> 01:53:39,458
Fuck it.

1393
01:53:57,750 --> 01:53:58,750
My Lord.

1394
01:54:01,625 --> 01:54:02,625
My Lord.

1395
01:54:06,792 --> 01:54:07,792
Still alive.

1396
01:54:13,333 --> 01:54:14,333
Master.

1397
01:54:15,250 --> 01:54:16,250
Mehersa.

1398
01:54:41,292 --> 01:54:42,292
Drunkard.

1399
01:54:45,792 --> 01:54:46,792
<i>Rekha!</i>

1400
01:54:47,083 --> 01:54:48,458
Just a sec, my lady.

1401
01:55:26,792 --> 01:55:27,792
Listen, girl.

1402
01:55:29,125 --> 01:55:30,500
You are pretty good at this.

1403
01:55:32,792 --> 01:55:33,792
Where did you learn?

1404
01:55:34,958 --> 01:55:36,292
I didn't learn it anywhere, my Lord.

1405
01:55:36,833 --> 01:55:38,792
As a kid, I would
massage my father's feet.

1406
01:55:39,625 --> 01:55:40,625
I see.

1407
01:55:42,333 --> 01:55:43,917
So you were always a smart girl?

1408
01:55:44,875 --> 01:55:46,750
Growing up, everyone always said,

1409
01:55:47,625 --> 01:55:50,083
"This girl will make the village
proud someday."

1410
01:55:52,125 --> 01:55:53,125
A little higher.

1411
01:55:56,708 --> 01:55:58,083
Can I ask you a question, my Lord?

1412
01:55:59,458 --> 01:56:02,083
Is this palace older
than a hundred years?

1413
01:56:03,458 --> 01:56:05,458
A little higher.

1414
01:56:08,708 --> 01:56:12,625
I never even dreamt I'd get to
live in such a palace someday.

1415
01:56:12,792 --> 01:56:13,792
A little higher.

1416
01:56:14,875 --> 01:56:16,375
Can I ask you a question, Lord?

1417
01:56:16,542 --> 01:56:20,125
Are the queen and prince going abroad?

1418
01:56:20,667 --> 01:56:23,125
If they leave
the palace will feel so lonely.

1419
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:25,750
But I've heard it's so pretty abroad.

1420
01:56:26,208 --> 01:56:27,667
Scoot.

1421
01:56:28,583 --> 01:56:29,542
Get out.

1422
01:56:30,583 --> 01:56:31,583
My Lord, I…

1423
01:56:33,417 --> 01:56:34,417
S-- Sorry…

1424
01:56:35,708 --> 01:56:37,833
I'm stupid, I say things without thought.

1425
01:56:37,917 --> 01:56:38,917
Forgive me, my Lord.

1426
01:56:40,292 --> 01:56:41,375
Stop sniffing around.

1427
01:56:43,583 --> 01:56:44,708
And focus on the job.

1428
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,583
You want to live in the palace, don't you?

1429
01:56:55,917 --> 01:56:56,917
Do you drink alcohol?

1430
01:57:06,667 --> 01:57:07,667
Here.

1431
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Take it.

1432
01:57:15,625 --> 01:57:16,625
Turn around,

1433
01:57:17,167 --> 01:57:18,167
come on.

1434
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Oh, this will stain.

1435
01:57:36,792 --> 01:57:38,542
Don't worry, my Lord, I'll wash it.

1436
01:57:42,375 --> 01:57:45,917
Do one thing… take it off.

1437
01:57:49,708 --> 01:57:50,708
Come on..

1438
01:57:53,042 --> 01:57:54,042
Don't think.

1439
01:57:57,875 --> 01:57:58,875
Little more.

1440
01:58:00,375 --> 01:58:01,375
Father.

1441
01:58:05,833 --> 01:58:06,958
Someone is here to meet you.

1442
01:58:10,375 --> 01:58:12,083
Fucking villagers
won't leave me alone for a second.

1443
01:58:55,958 --> 01:58:57,083
I will study hard.

1444
01:58:59,375 --> 01:59:00,375
We will go to England.

1445
01:59:02,333 --> 01:59:03,583
Won't live here!

1446
01:59:06,042 --> 01:59:07,083
That's all I wanted to say.

1447
01:59:34,083 --> 01:59:35,500
Bunch of thugs, all of them.

1448
01:59:39,625 --> 01:59:43,167
I spent so much in bribes.

1449
01:59:43,292 --> 01:59:44,292
All a waste, rascals!

1450
01:59:45,625 --> 01:59:46,667
Chanda, that bitch.

1451
01:59:47,542 --> 01:59:49,792
Even my son wants to leave me and go.

1452
01:59:51,917 --> 01:59:53,958
An astrologer once said to me,
I will die lonely.

1453
01:59:57,250 --> 01:59:58,250
Go away, fuckers.

1454
01:59:59,708 --> 02:00:00,833
Leave me!

1455
02:02:34,750 --> 02:02:36,583
<i>"Good you got out of here."</i>
