4
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,753
The tide's against us.

5
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,171
Aye, but we have the wind.

6
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,383
She'll blow us straight to the gates.

MATTHOS: You're coming home.

8
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:39,553
DAVOS: King's Landing hasn't been home
for 20 years.

9
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:44,767
I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet.

10
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,188
And now I'm sailing right at them.

11
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,440
This is the royal fleet.

12
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,442
And you're not a smuggler anymore,
you're the high captain.

13
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:56,695
Of course, there are...
several royal fleets at the moment.

14
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:57,822
Not after tonight.

15
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:01,617
When the sun rises,
Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne

16
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,160
and you will be his Hand.

17
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,995
- Gods be good.
- God.

18
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,248
Father, there is only one
and he watches over us.

19
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,500
- But not over them?
- Over all of us.

20
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,546
The people of King's Landing did not
choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon.

21
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,048
They will be glad to see his head on a spike.

22
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,801
Well, first, we have to put it there.

23
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,720
Our ships outnumber theirs 10-to-1.

24
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:23,472
Our army outnumber theirs 5-to-1.

25
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,766
Those walls have never been breached,

26
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:27,977
and the men guarding the walls,

27
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,188
when they see you, they don't see a liberator,

28
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:34,275
they see a stranger come
to set their city on fire.

29
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,111
I have faith in the Lord of Light.

30
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,238
I have faith in our cause.

00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,069
Are you afraid, my lion?

34
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,828
If the city falls, Stannis will
burn every Lannister he can find.

35
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,082
Of course I'm afraid.

36
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,171
I won't let them hurt you.

37
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,469
I'm a Lannister.

38
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,263
I don't have a choice in all this.

39
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,600
But it's not your war.

40
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,274
It is now.

41
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,490
You can't fuck your way out of everything.

42
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,660
I have so far.

43
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,958
Do you remember what you said
when you met me in your tent?

44
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:20,172
That I should make love to you
like it was your last day on this earth.

45
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,645
PYCELLE: As you know, Your Grace,

46
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,565
it is not only the sworn duty of a maester

47
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,693
to carry out the wishes
of the house he serves,

48
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,529
but also to offer guidance

49
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,782
and counsel in times of war.

50
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,410
Your words are always wise and measured.

51
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,912
- If you could...
- If anything,

52
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:55,916
a maester's duties become more urgent

53
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,336
in times of war and turmoil.

54
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:03,757
I remember back in the days of King...

55
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,384
You brought me something?

56
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:07,428
Yes.

57
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:13,225
Essence of nightshade

58
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:17,313
is as dangerous as it is efficacious.

59
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,858
A single drop in a cup of wine

60
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,695
suffices to soothe ragged nerves.

61
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,491
Three drops will bring on
a deep and dreamless sleep.

62
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,620
Ten drops, however...

63
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,455
I know what ten drops will bring.

64
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,915
Your Grace, if I may ask...

65
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,375
You may not.

66
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,921
You must have a lot of work to do.

67
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,549
I'm sure many brave men
will need your wisdom soon.

68
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:50,304
Yes. A siege is very...

69
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,556
Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester.
There are so many.

- Drunk Lannisters.

Thank you very much.

82
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,232
And I like your nose.

00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,943
How many times you break it?

- My mam smacked me with an iron poker.
- Oh.

87
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,373
It wasn't me she was aiming at.

88
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,333
She was trying for my little brother.

89
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:02,710
Now he was a real pest.

90
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,963
Second time, I was nine.

91
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,800
Got in a scrap with a few older boys.

92
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,468
They won.

93
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:13,512
Third time...

94
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,023
Eh, you don't want to know
about the third time.

95

Poor nose.

96

Don't feel sorry for him.

00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,165

is to put one of us in the cold ground

of every boy in town.

The map you asked for.

145
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,113
There must be 20 miles of tunnels
beneath the city.

146
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,823
Closer to 50.

147
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:05,452
The Targaryens built this city
to withstand a siege

148
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,872
and to provide escape if necessary.

149
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,999
I'm not escaping.

150
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,251
Strange as it sounds,
I'm the captain of the ship,

151
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,878
and if the ship goes down, I go with her.

152
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,922
That is good to hear.

153
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:21,343
Though I'm sure many captains say the same
while their ship is afloat.

154
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,055
You look well suited for battle, my lord.

that Stannis Baratheon has taken up
with a red priestess from Asshai.

What of it?

160
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:42,197
You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?

161
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,409
Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting.
What do you think?

162
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,037
I think you believe in what you see

163
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,582
and in what those you trust have seen.

164

You probably don't entirely trust me.

165

Mmm, don't take it personally.

You'll kiss it again when I return

00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:53,863
- The wildfire.
- He can only play it once.

328
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,115
We're too far from the gates.

329
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:58,409
The fire, their archers...

330
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,536
Hundreds will die.

331
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,247
Thousands.

332
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,430
Come with me and take this city!

333
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:20,973
(CHEERING)

334
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,117
Sansa, come here, little dove.

335
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:47,583
My queen.

336
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,919
What are you doing?

337
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,295
Praying.

338
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:54,173
You're perfect, aren't you?

339
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:55,508
Praying.

340
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,177
What are you praying for?

341
00:27:58,261 --> 00:28:00,555
For the gods to have mercy on us all.

342
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:02,598
Oh.

343
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:03,975
On all of us?

344
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:06,102
- Yes, Your Grace.
- Even me?

345
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:08,271
Of course, Your Grace.

346
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:09,856
Even Joffrey?

347
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,528
- Joffrey is my...
- Oh, shut up, you little fool.

348
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,698
Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all.

349
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,867
The gods have no mercy.
That's why they're gods.

350
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:25,121
My father told me that
when he caught me praying.

351
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,041
My mother had just died, you see.

352
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:33,296
I didn't really understand
the concept of death, the finality of it.

353
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,549
I thought that if I prayed very, very hard,

354
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:39,510
the gods would return my mother to me.
I was four.

355
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:42,471
Your father doesn't believe in the gods?

356
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,932
He believes in them,
he just doesn't like them very much.

357
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,812
One for her.

358
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:54,942
Here.

359
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:58,321
Sit.

360
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,114
Drink.

361
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,494
Not like that. Drink, girl.

362
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,083
I should have been born a man.

363
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,127
I'd rather face a thousand swords

364
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,672
than be shut up inside
with this flock of frightened hens.

365
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,676
They are your guests under your protection.
You asked them here.

366
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,929
It was expected of me,

367
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:26,515
as it will be of you
if you ever become Joffrey's queen.

368
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:30,770
If my wretched brother
should somehow prevail,

369
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,856
these hens will return to their cocks

370
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:37,902
and crow of how my courage inspired them,

371
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,904
lifted their spirits.

372
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,822
And if the city should fall?

373
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:45,743
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

374
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,955
The Red Keep should hold for a time,

375
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:53,542
long enough for me to go to the walls
and yield to Lord Stannis in person.

376
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,379
If it were anyone else outside those gates,

377
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,381
I might have hoped for a private audience,

378
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,716
but this is Stannis Baratheon.

379
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,887
I'd have a better chance
of seducing his horse.

380
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:10,476
Have I shocked you, little dove?

381
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,229
Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.

382
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,942
The best one's between your legs.

383
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:20,736
Learn how to use it. Drink.

384
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:28,244
Do you have any notion of what happens
when a city is sacked?

385
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:31,747
No, you wouldn't, would you?

386
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,751
If the city falls, these fine women

387
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,088
should be in for a bit of a rape.

388
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,843
Half of them will have bastards
in their bellies come the morning.

389
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:47,263
You'll be glad of your red flower then.

390
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:52,268
When a man's blood is up,
anything with tits looks good.

391
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,606
A precious thing like you
will look very, very good.

392
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,735

427
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,561
CERSEI: When we were young, Jaime and I,

428
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:26,565
we looked so much alike
even our father couldn't tell us apart.

429
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:30,236
I could never understand why
they treated us differently.

430
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:34,782
Jaime was taught to fight
with sword and lance and mace,

431
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:37,493
and I was taught to smile

432
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,453
and sing and please.

433
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,164
He was heir to Casterly Rock,

434
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,376
and I was sold to some stranger like a horse

435
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:47,378
to be ridden whenever he desired.

436
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,797
You were Robert's queen.

437
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,007
And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy.

438
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,180
I don't think I know this one.

439
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:05,437
Pretty.

440
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,862
That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen.

441
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,699
Here, it's not difficult.
I mastered it when I was four.

442
00:35:17,408 --> 00:35:19,660
Straighten your back and bend.

443
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,498
Better. You learn fast.

444
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:28,335
How long have you been
in Lady Sansa's service?

445
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,964
A few weeks, Your Grace.

446
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,552
When did you leave Lorath?

447
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:40,556
I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.

448
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:46,353
But she was a nobleman's daughter.

449
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:47,604
You're not.

450
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,444
When did you come to Westeros?

451
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,655
Ten years ago, Your Grace.

452
00:35:57,448 --> 00:36:01,410
From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep
in 10 years,

453
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:04,371
all without learning how to curtsy.

454
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:07,458

But...

465
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:42,618
But his troops
have landed outside the city walls.

466
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:44,953
Where is Joffrey?

467
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,748
On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.

468

- What?

The king's presence is good for morale.

471
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:58,092
Bring him back to his chambers now.

- Not here?
- With the women and children?

Do you want him to be mocked as a coward
for the rest of his life?

- No, but I...
- Now!

He's here for us.

Stannis may take the city,
he may take the throne,

655
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,825
"For one day, all the beasts will bow to you.

656
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,577
"You will be king.

657
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,874
"All the stags will bow.
All the wolves will bow.

658
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:29,045
"The bears in the north
and the foxes of the south,

659
00:51:30,672 --> 00:51:34,092
"all the birds in the sky
and the beasts in the sea,

660
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:38,888
"they will all come to you, little lion,

661
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:41,266
"to rest a crown upon your head."

662
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:49,148
And the cub said,

663
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:52,193
"Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"

664
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:55,530
"Yes," said his mother.

665
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:59,200
"You will be strong and fierce
just like your father."

666
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,556
I will keep you safe, my love.

667
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:23,558
I promise you.

668
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,561
(DOOR OPENS)

669
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,527
Back to the boats!

670
00:52:36,738 --> 00:52:38,406
Stand and fight!

671
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:42,493
Stand and fight, damn you!

672
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:44,787
No!

673
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:49,250
Father.

674
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:57,550
The battle is over. We have won.

675
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:11,939
MAN: (SINGING) "And who are you,"
the proud lord said

676
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:16,361
"That I must bow so low?"

677
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:21,949
"Only a cat of a different coat

678
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:26,454
"That's all the truth I know

679
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:32,126
"In a coat of gold or a coat of red

680
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:37,131
"A lion still has claws

681
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:42,220
"And mine are long and sharp, my lord

682
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:46,557
"As long and sharp as yours"

683
00:53:49,394 --> 00:53:54,690
And so he spoke, and so he spoke

684
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:59,695
That Lord of Castamere

685
00:53:59,779 --> 00:54:04,826
But now the rains weep o'er his hall

686
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:09,622
With no one there to hear

687
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:15,086
Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall

688
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:19,799
And not a soul to hear
