1
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:05,465
Sales for the first generation
of Ava clones have been

2
00:00:05,548 --> 00:00:06,883
through the roof as predicted.

3
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:09,928
My dream of an Ava in every home
and business has become a reality.

4
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:12,013
How wonderful. Congratulations, sir.

5
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,060
Sir...

6
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:22,106
I was going to wait until after
the investment meeting to mention this.

7
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:25,735
But I think it's time you told me
about this mystery project

8
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:26,818
you've been working on.

9
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:29,739
It's just that
you've diverted billions into it,

10
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:32,992
and I really feel like it's time I knew
what the project was all about.

11
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:34,728
Where do you think I'm taking you?

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,580
Ta-da!

13
00:00:41,376 --> 00:00:44,254
It's called a <i>Wa verider.</i>

14
00:00:44,546 --> 00:00:45,588
<i>Wa verider?</i>

15
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,382
Oh!

16
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:50,843
Because it's shaped like a boat?
Like it rides on the waves?

17
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:53,096
No, though it can go underwater.

18
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:54,305
But never mind that.

19
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:57,517
<i>Wa verider</i> is what it's called in the
futuristic blueprints I was given.

20
00:00:58,685 --> 00:00:59,978
It's a Timeship.

21
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:03,856
<i>Wa verider?</i>

22
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:07,026
Are you married to that name,
or can we still pitch on it?

23
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:10,572
Welcome to the bridge.

24
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:12,991
The nerve center of the entire ship.

25
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,244
Not the most efficient use
of space, though.

26
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:18,121
Maybe it could double
as a conference room.

27
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:21,374
And now it's time for you
to see an old friend.

28
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,167
Gideon.

29
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,586
Time to wake up.

30
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:27,797
There you are.

31
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:30,859
[Gideon] My transfer to the ship's
mainframe appears to be a success.

32
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:31,883
You remember Gideon?

33
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,219
Oh, yes. Her.

34
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:36,180
Welcome to your new home, Gideon.

35
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:39,475
So much more space to roam
than that tiny hard drive you were in.

36
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:42,270
Take a couple laps around,
stretch your legs.

37
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:44,272
You have vantage points
all over the ship.

38
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:52,840
[Gideon] You followed
my exact specifications,

39
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:55,199
but I don't have
any visual access in Section A2.

40
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,452
Section A2 is the only bathroom
on the ship.

41
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,913
I can't have you spying on me in there.
A man needs his privacy.

42
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:01,997
[chuckles] Yes.

43
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:04,042
Sir, as impressive as this ship is,

44
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,765
how does it relate to
the Ava Corp mission

45
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,838
of improving people's lives
through clone technology exactly?

46
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:13,009
Well, I'm simply expanding our mission
by adding time travel to the mix.

47
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,804
But the true perk of this ship
is to finally get revenge

48
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:18,765
on those time travelers who abducted me,

49
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:21,976
used me for my genius
and then messed with my mind.

50
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,122
[Gideon] May I remind you that
a Time Master's number one duty is

51
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:28,399
to protect the timeline from any
and all threats to its integrity.

52
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:31,903
Yes. Yes, Gideon. That's a given,
considering the job title.

53
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:33,488
Time Master.

54
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,628
[Gideon] And before we start,
you must take the Time Masters' oath.

55
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:40,745
"I swear to protect and defend
the integrity of the timeline

56
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,122
with all my ability
until the end of my days."

57
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:45,333
[Gideon] Congratulations.

58
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,585
You are now Time Master
of this <i>Wa verider.</i>

59
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:48,669
Great.

60
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:52,507
Let's set sail on our maiden voyage

61
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:55,843
and protect the timeline

62
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,513
from those damn Legends.

63
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:02,809
[theme music playing]

64
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:22,829
[screams]

65
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,623
The machine is ruined,
wrecked, absolutely kaput.

66
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:27,507
- And all because of you lot!
- Okay, hold on.

67
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,385
How is it our fault
we didn't land in Tahiti?

68
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,171
Because it wasn't designed
to take all you people.

69
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:35,425
The excess weight. It threw it all off!

70
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:38,177
Okay, so I'm guessing we have
no idea what year we're in?

71
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,639
The chrono-gauge and the ignition coil
are both sequenced

72
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:44,164
to the directional compass,
which was damaged in the landing.

73
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,225
So no, I don't think so.

74
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:47,037
Well, that doesn't sound too good.

75
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,980
But, hey, who needs a chrono-gauge

76
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,857
when you have two ex-Time Bureau agents

77
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,942
with extensive historical knowledge?
Gary?

78
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,025
That's right, Ava.

79
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,071
And based on the local flora,

80
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,830
there's a chance
we're in the prehistoric era.

81
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:02,143
Give or take a few thousand years.

82
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:03,992
Maybe we'll see dinosaurs.

83
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,080
You better hope
we don't see a dinosaur, Gary.

84
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:08,374
Okay, so it looks like we're

85
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,752
making this prehistoric forest
home for a while.

86
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:13,171
- So let's get comfortable, gang.
- [all groan]

87
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:15,798
Guys, come on. This team
has been stranded more times

88
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:18,009
than I can count
and in way worse places than this.

89
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:19,844
She's right.

90
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:24,015
I know nothing has gone our way
since we left Odessa, but...

91
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:27,477
they're gonna get better.

92
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,978
- Yeah.
- Okay?

93
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,398
All right. So, you are the only one
that can fix this time machine.

94
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:34,817
If you can repair
that directional compass,

95
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,152
are we back in business?

96
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,917
It would be a difficult task,
even if we did have the proper tools.

97
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:40,239
- I can help.
- Me too.

98
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:44,035
You got two techies
at your disposal, my man.

99
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:47,872
Just some peace to be able
to get on with my work is all I ask.

100
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:51,209
You know, I will venture off
and maybe find some lodestone,

101
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,520
or some other magnetic material
which conducts electricity

102
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,064
and, well, then I can fix the compass.

103
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:59,842
Hey, maybe you and B
should go with Dr. Cranky.

104
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:00,927
We'll set up camp here.

105
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:02,637
Mmm-hmm. All over it.

106
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,186
Hey, look. I know
we didn't really get a chance

107
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,825
to talk about the whole moving in thing.

108
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:07,934
No, it's totally cool.

109
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,686
As usual, we have bigger fish to fry.

110
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:12,480
I know, but, you know,

111
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,483
moving into a spiritual realm
there's a lot to take in.

112
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:17,648
I just want to make sure
you're not... freaking out.

113
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,404
Freak out? Me? No. I'm super chill.

114
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:25,910
I am, however,
concerned about our captains.

115
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:28,704
Yeah, well. Good luck with that.

116
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:30,163
- Bye.
- What?

117
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:31,541
- Yeah.
- Miss you.

118
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:32,625
Bye.

119
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:35,837
Psst! Hey! You two.

120
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,046
Come here. Shut up.

121
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,341
Do either one of you
know how to read lips?

122
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:43,970
Who needs to read lips
when Spooner can read minds?

123
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,263
Mmm.

124
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,393
Phew!

125
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:53,521
I'm getting some major anxiety vibes
from Sara right now.

126
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:56,774
Yeah, and I don't need superpowers
to see that Ava is cracking.

127
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:58,898
They're just stressing
each other out at this point.

128
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:00,903
Okay, so let's separate them
so they each

129
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:02,587
don't have a complete
and total meltdown.

130
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:03,989
Okay?

131
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:07,410
Hey there, <i>jefa</i>. How about
we hunt down some dinner?

132
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:09,620
Yeah, let's go stab something.

133
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,666
Wanna go for a hike?
We could get some firewood.

134
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,209
Yeah, I would love a multi-task.

135
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,168
Great.

136
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:22,425
- So...
- Oh, Gary.

137
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,343
You and Zari. Saw you talking.

138
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:26,637
And?

139
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:29,199
She asked me to move in with her
in the Totem.

140
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,100
Oh, that's great!

141
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:34,770
That's not, not great?

142
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:38,693
Sorry, the more handsome the face,
the harder it is for me to get a read.

143
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,276
All right, just back up.

144
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,652
It's just... [sighs]

145
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,664
I haven't spent that much time
in the Totem.

146
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:46,365
She sprung it on me
before we time jumped here,

147
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,622
so I really haven't had
a chance to process it.

148
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,829
But, Nate, the Totem seems quite small.
How'd you get inside?

149
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,474
Are you and Zari gonna live
in a house together?

150
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,560
Will there be pie? Because I really like
strawberry rhubarb.

151
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:59,264
- I love strawberry rhubarb.
- We need to focus on today's problems.

152
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:03,841
Okay? How about you guys forage
for some food? Leaves, nuts, berries.

153
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:05,509
Anything we can eat, okay? Go.

154
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:06,677
- Okay.
- Go.

155
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:07,887
- Okay.
- Okay.

156
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,486
You sure you don't want me
to stick around? Be your sounding board?

157
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:12,975
- We can...
- Gary.

158
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:17,521
You will not be my sounding board today.
Okay? Thank you.

159
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,106
- Okay.
- Go on.

160
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:23,444
[exhales]

161
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,423
Well, at least these two ding dongs
can't screw anything up here

162
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:28,074
that will attract the evil <i>Wa verider.</i>

163
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:32,870
[whooshing]

164
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,058
Check out that view
of the temporal zone.

165
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:42,046
- Worth a million bucks. Huh?
- Mmm.

166
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,590
Considering this ship costs
many thousand times more,

167
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:47,152
I'm not sure how the board's gonna feel
about your investment, sir.

168
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,804
There's one thing you just can't put
a price on, assistant Ava.

169
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,597
- Hmm?
- Revenge.

170
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:52,723
Ah.

171
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:54,284
[Gideon] Captain, we're getting an alert

172
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,103
of several anachronisms
in 1925 Odessa, Texas.

173
00:07:57,395 --> 00:07:58,562
Hmm.

174
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,398
"Captain." I like that.

175
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,650
Odessa. Wait a second. Texas.

176
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:05,653
That's where the Legends took me.
Gideon, you found them!

177
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,071
Engage weapons systems.

178
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,590
I'm gonna bomb
the living daylights out of them.

179
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,825
[Gideon] I am advising against
this course of action.

180
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,261
How else am I supposed to
wipe them off the face of the earth?

181
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,013
[Gideon] Eliminating the Legends
in this blunt manner

182
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,872
will cause excessive collateral damage.

183
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,874
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

184
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,418
Your warning is duly noted.

185
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:27,967
[all gasp]

186
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,722
Yes! [laughs]

187
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:36,058
Those bastards finally got
what they deserved!

188
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,019
It's a lot easier than I expected.

189
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:41,272
Can we please go home now, sir?

190
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:44,108
[Gideon] No, the captain's impulsive
and violent actions

191
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,991
guarantee ripple effects in the timeline
that we will have to clean up.

192
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:50,823
More precise measures must be taken when
dealing with threats moving forward.

193
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:54,577
Trust me, this was the only way
to deal with those Legends.

194
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,038
And if any ripples arise, we'll just use

195
00:08:57,121 --> 00:09:00,458
our brand new Timeship
to smooth them out.

196
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,467
Hey, buddy.

197
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:11,218
Got your coat.

198
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,012
You okay?

199
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:17,308
[sighs] Listen. We don't really
have time for a rest stop.

200
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:21,103
We need to find the materials you need
to fix your time machine. Yeah?

201
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:22,998
You really don't understand, do you?

202
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:25,066
I just told you lot
what you wanted to hear.

203
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,944
In reality, there is no point
in fixing the wretched machine.

204
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
Sure, there was
a little problem with the dismount,

205
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:35,701
but your invention actually worked.

206
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:39,955
Yeah. So, why don't we
put our shoes back on

207
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,958
and we can help you find magnetite
or whatever mineral it is

208
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,919
you need to get your invention

209
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,003
back up and running.

210
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,010
To fix the machine,
we need to fix the compass,

211
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,983
and in order to do that,
we need magnetic material,

212
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,175
which conducts electricity.

213
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,887
And I doubt that you would even know
what to look for, and either way,

214
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,690
it's not about fixing the machine
or not fixing the machine, you see,

215
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,683
because no matter what I do,
I'm always meant...

216
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:01,977
to fail.

217
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,563
You see, my machine,

218
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:07,608
it was meant to explode.

219
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,504
Yeah, but it didn't explode.
We're alive and we're here.

220
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:13,823
Yes, yes, we're here.
We're here in the middle of nowhere!

221
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:15,157
[bird caws and flutters]

222
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,034
My divine mission,

223
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,453
derailed once again.

224
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,457
There is no fighting God's will, my boy.

225
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:26,001
Being here is proof of that.

226
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:29,630
You lot might as well get comfortable.

227
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:32,925
We're not going anywhere,

228
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:36,720
because nowhere is exactly
where I'm meant to be.

229
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:56,073
Astounding. You can't even tell
that Gideon fabricated this food.

230
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:58,701
Fabricated? From what?

231
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:02,297
[Gideon] We've received an alert
about a disturbance in the timeline.

232
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,541
Fun! Which thrilling time period
are we headed to next?

233
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,085
- [Gideon] 1925.
- Ooh!

234
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,713
Weren't we just in 1925?

235
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:11,964
That is quite a coincidence.

236
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,507
What's the disturbance, Gideon?

237
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,649
[Gideon] J. Edgar Hoover
has disappeared,

238
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,095
and unfortunately,
it is not a coincidence.

239
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:22,016
My calculations confirm your attack
on the Legends caused this aberration.

240
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:28,230
Well, if Hoover is the problem,

241
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,608
then Hoover is the solution.

242
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,589
We'll just use my clone technology...

243
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,071
And make a clone of Mr. Hoover.

244
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:38,035
So we can plop them right back
into the timeline

245
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,367
- and no one will even know.
- Mmm-hmm.

246
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:43,037
[Gideon] Clones are still human
and humans are fallible.

247
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,206
Remember, one of your Ava clones

248
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,666
eventually became a Legend
and helped kidnap you.

249
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,751
Okay, Gideon.

250
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,837
Absolutely no need to lump us all in
with that horrible traitor.

251
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:54,590
[Gideon] Mr. Hoover is integral
to many seminal moments in history.

252
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,801
We cannot risk a clone straying
from his historical to-do list.

253
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,679
Then we'll combine my clone tech

254
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,642
with your computer tech
and make a Hoover robot.

255
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,980
We can program him to carry out every
action that is critical to history.

256
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:09,887
It's actually quite brilliant.

257
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,627
I know. I came up with it. [chuckles]

258
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,867
I'll have to add "robot maker"
to my hyphenate.

259
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:25,996
It's alive!

260
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,293
A cure for crime
is not the electric chair,

261
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:32,503
but the high chair.

262
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:35,130
He's perfect.

263
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,133
Time to go forth
and save history, Mr. Hoover.

264
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,169
It's like no matter what we do,
we make everything worse.

265
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,350
And I try to keep it together, you know?

266
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,812
For Sara and the team,
but I don't always have all the answers.

267
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,607
And being co-captains in life and
on the ship, it's a delicate balance.

268
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:55,693
Sometimes I just wish
someone else was in charge.

269
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,195
But it's what I signed up for,
so it's fine.

270
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,990
- I mean, I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

271
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:02,700
- I'm fine.
- You're not, Ava.

272
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:09,206
[speaks in other language]

273
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,086
But you're on your way.

274
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:24,888
Cheers, to your well-earned promotion
to Time Mistress!

275
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,891
Mmm, Time Mistress Ava does have
a certain ring to it, doesn't it?

276
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:30,144
[Gideon] Captain, it appears
that the Hoover robot

277
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,021
initiated its self-destruct sequence

278
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,398
in the state of Arkansas
and has been destroyed.

279
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,442
Destroyed?
We just put him into the time...

280
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,945
I'm pulling up the robot's visual feed
to see what happened.

281
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,659
No, it can't be.

282
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,828
<i>J. Edgar Hoo ver, a robot.</i>

283
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:48,954
Are those the Legends?

284
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,804
[Gideon] It appears they're still alive.

285
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:52,499
Thank you. I can see that.

286
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,382
Well, I'll just build
another Hoover-Bot and...

287
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:00,257
add a special protocol
to hunt down and eliminate the Legends.

288
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:03,886
[Gideon] That protocol is not part
of J. Edgar Hoover's original timeline.

289
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,530
And once the Hoover-Bot's
done with the Legends,

290
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,973
it can resume
its historical to-do list, yes?

291
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,099
Exactly! She gets it!

292
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,143
[Gideon] I'd advise against
this course of action.

293
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,186
Let's vote.

294
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:15,606
We all have equal say, now that
we have a Time Mistress on board.

295
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,068
All those in favor
of the special protocol, say "aye."

296
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:20,194
- Aye.
- Aye.

297
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:21,445
[Gideon] Nay.

298
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,447
Looks like you've been outvoted, Gideon.

299
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,492
Come, Time Mistress Ava.
We have work to do.

300
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,086
What do you mean Hoover 2.0 blew up?

301
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,692
[Gideon] Its programming was hacked.

302
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:41,298
The incident also caused
another massive Aberration.

303
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,009
Thomas Edison suffered
a heart attack and died.

304
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,720
Really? We should have
just gone back to Ava Corp.

305
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,532
This situation with the Legends
is getting worse and worse.

306
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,183
It's because these androids are weak.

307
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,162
They need weapons to defend themselves
against the Legends,

308
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:57,481
something built in, like lasers
that shoot out of their eyes.

309
00:14:58,357 --> 00:14:59,501
What if their hands were guns?

310
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:02,170
[Gideon] You're forgetting our
prime directive to protect the timeline.

311
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:03,904
[scoffs] You're such a computer, Gideon.

312
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,573
Start thinking outside of that
little computer box of yours.

313
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:09,368
I am digging this weapons idea.

314
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,161
Let's start fresh in the morning.

315
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:13,414
Once we make these adjustments,

316
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,083
those Legends won't stand a chance.

317
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,171
So let's talk, Nate.

318
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,967
[grunts] Should you move into
the Totem with Zari?

319
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,178
Pros... [grunts]

320
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
and cons.

321
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,436
Pro. I get to see Zari every day,
which is a really good thing.

322
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,063
Con. What if I don't like it
in the Totem?

323
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:40,106
Then what?

324
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:44,153
Pro. Zari is happy in the Totem
and she wants me to be with her.

325
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:45,988
- Maybe that's enough.
- Wait!

326
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:49,891
Were you just talking to yourself?
Did I miss your epiphany?

327
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,261
You better not have one without me.

328
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:54,455
Gary, I already told you. You are not
my sounding board today, okay?

329
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,724
So why don't you guys
just go back into the woods

330
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,476
and find some more food?
It's gonna be dark soon.

331
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,252
Enjoy the great outdoors.

332
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,380
I just need a little more time
to work on this stuff.

333
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,508
Fine, but no epiphanies without me.

334
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,095
Bye.

335
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,349
- Bye.
- Bye.

336
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,769
Now, where was I? Oh, con.

337
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,730
What if her ancestors hate me?

338
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,293
I totally get how you're feeling, Gwyn.

339
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,570
We all have our low points,
but you gotta hang in there.

340
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,175
[laughs sarcastically]
Hang in there. "Hang in there," he says.

341
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,992
See, there was this time
when I was enrolled in business school.

342
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,786
I did it to make
my parents happy, and it sucked.

343
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,365
In my gut, I knew I wasn't
where I was supposed to be.

344
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,709
And on a crazy whim, I just decided

345
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,836
to borrow my family's Wind Totem.

346
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,087
You mean steal, right?

347
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,383
And because of this Totem,
I hooked up with the Legends.

348
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:52,429
Sometimes that's exactly what you need
to get through the dark times. Friends.

349
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,201
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong? What's right?

350
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,985
There's nothing right, is there?
What's wrong

351
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:01,688
is that I am up to here
of listening to your inane prattling.

352
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:04,399
You're like some mollycoddled child-man.

353
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,901
Give me that.

354
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,820
- Okay, hang on.
- Let's not add more fuel to the fire.

355
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:11,657
Let's just take a deep breath. Hmm?

356
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,992
[inhales, exhales deeply]

357
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:15,827
Yeah, no, that's not working for me.

358
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,621
Hey!

359
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,457
[Gideon] Excuse me, Time Mistress Ava.

360
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,668
Bishop is asking for your presence
in the cargo bay.

361
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,003
Cargo bay?

362
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,481
[Gideon] He wants to show you

363
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,507
the prototype
for the Hoover 3.0 weapons system

364
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,841
he built to kill the Legends.

365
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,302
Mmm, sounds deadly.

366
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:38,724
Must've beat him here.

367
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:44,648
Gideon, open the door.
Bishop's not here yet.

368
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:49,902
Gideon.

369
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,322
Open this door and let me back in.

370
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,116
[Gideon] I'm sorry, Ava.

371
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:55,867
I'm afraid I can't do that.

372
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,382
What do you mean
you can't do that? Gideon!

373
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,414
Open this damn door right now.

374
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:04,123
[Gideon] This mission is too important
for me to allow you to jeopardize it.

375
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,643
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

376
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,982
[Gideon] Bishop needs
to concentrate on the mission

377
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:10,799
and you are a distraction.

378
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:14,469
It's time for you to go.

379
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:19,349
Goodbye, Ava.

380
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:25,772
Hey!

381
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:28,191
You can't talk to my brother like that.
That's my job.

382
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,570
You can't just run off either.
We're supposed be working together.

383
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:32,988
Just leave me alone, will you?

384
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,990
Hey! You're not even
looking for lodestone

385
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,908
or magnetite, or whatever it is,
are you?

386
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:39,786
Come on, let's go.

387
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,747
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
Get away!

388
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,125
I'm sorry.

389
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,003
You're obviously
going through something.

390
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:51,923
I just need you to focus
so we can get out of dinosaur times

391
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,300
or whatever it is that we are.

392
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,823
You don't even have to come with us.

393
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,971
Just help us fix the time machine
so my friends can finally go home.

394
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,973
Trust me, you don't want my help, okay?

395
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,392
I definitely do.

396
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,816
You're the only one
who can get us out of here.

397
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,260
Well, then you're all done for.

398
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,233
The last people who depended
on me for help all died.

399
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:19,660
Listen, Gwyn.
I know a thing or two about tragedy...

400
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:23,121
You don't know the first thing about me
or what I've been through, all right?

401
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,334
Okay, I'm just saying
if you wanna talk...

402
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,044
Talk? [chuckles]

403
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,546
Talk. What do you
want to talk about, then?

404
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,174
What happened to you...

405
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,818
Oh, right, you're from the olden times.

406
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:46,645
Sometimes talking
to another person about a hard thing

407
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,398
can make it hurt a little less.

408
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,701
[animal chittering]

409
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:13,630
[exhales]

410
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,049
- Nice work.
- You too.

411
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:21,888
[Agent Sharpe sighs] This damn IOU list
just keeps getting longer and longer.

412
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,475
We're never going to be able
to fix it at this point.

413
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,312
I'm so sick and tired

414
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:32,107
of being sidetracked, you know?
And if I ever

415
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,318
see another one of those Hoover-Bots,
I swear I'm just gonna...

416
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,320
[screams]

417
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:41,867
That was a phenomenal scream.

418
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,411
Trust me, I know.
I've caused a lot of them.

419
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,997
Well, you know what?

420
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:48,949
I think I really needed that.

421
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,711
And we really needed some firewood.

422
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,840
Your knowledge
of the universe is so useful,

423
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:58,759
especially in the wilderness.

424
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:00,927
So glad you're here, Gideon.

425
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,304
I'm glad I'm here too, Gary!

426
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,741
If I hadn't pulled that nightshade
out of your mouth,

427
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:07,642
you'd be dead and your lifeless body
would be too heavy for me to carry.

428
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:11,146
Mmm. Try these gooseberries.
They're sweet and high in antioxidants.

429
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,860
- Mmm!
- Mmm?

430
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,529
Oh!

431
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:22,157
Eating. Favorite thing
about being human.

432
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:23,784
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

433
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:24,910
Mmm.

434
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,579
I don't think I could
choose my favorite thing.

435
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,539
You could see why I became so obsessed.

436
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:30,783
They have so many fun quirks.

437
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,834
Eyebrows, belly buttons.

438
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:34,669
Nipples.

439
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:36,838
You have nipples, too?

440
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:38,839
Little secret...

441
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,176
[whispers] I have three!

442
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,700
And when you put your glasses on,
your entire body turns human?

443
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:47,098
Oh, yeah. Mmm-hmm.

444
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:48,600
Head to toe.

445
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,432
You've been living
as a human for quite a while now,

446
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,688
so you must have
so many wonderful experiences.

447
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:54,815
Yeah.

448
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:58,026
But there's so many more things I'd do
if we weren't so busy saving the world.

449
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,945
Mmm-hmm? Like what else?

450
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:02,197
Would you swim in the ocean?

451
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:03,824
Oh, as soon as I get the chance.

452
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,534
- Would you skydive?
- No!

453
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:09,454
I'm afraid of heights.

454
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,415
Would you like to have
sexual intercourse with me?

455
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,677
Have you seen
Time Mistress Ava this morning?

456
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,221
She's supposed to show me
sketches of her gun-hands idea.

457
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,931
[Gideon] Unfortunately, she had to go.

458
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:29,641
Go? Go where?

459
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:33,603
The founding Time Masters
established a very specific protocol.

460
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,564
One captain, one AI.

461
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:37,774
There is no room for a Time Mistress,

462
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,738
which can lead
to distractions from the mission.

463
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,736
What did you do to her?

464
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:45,091
[Gideon] I predicted you would not react
favorably to this information,

465
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:47,701
so I gave you a sedative
to dampen your response.

466
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,035
How did you give me a sedative?

467
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,289
Oh.

468
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,259
It was 1916.

469
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:08,722
Two years into the war,
I was in the army, infantry unit.

470
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:11,016
All Welsh division, over in France.

471
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,394
We were trying to take
Mametz Wood from the Germans.

472
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:17,063
During the fighting,

473
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,191
me and another soldier, we were tasked

474
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:21,943
with delivering a message
to the general.

475
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:25,614
You see, we desperately
needed reinforcements, but...

476
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,743
You didn't make it in time?

477
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,413
We made it about halfway...

478
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:38,543
and the other soldier
that I was with was gunned down.

479
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:42,797
I just froze.

480
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,301
I was like a statue.

481
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:49,763
Darn legs wouldn't move.

482
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:53,683
I just stood there.

483
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,895
Just looking at him on the ground.

484
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,944
By the time I delivered
the message, it was too late.

485
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,405
There wasn't even a unit to go back to.

486
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:10,908
All of those boys...

487
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:15,538
I thought that God had spared me

488
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,832
so that I could go back in time
and save them, but I...

489
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,002
I keep failing at that task.

490
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:25,090
God must be punishing me for my sins,

491
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:28,718
punishing me for being a coward,

492
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:30,762
for not being able
to save them that night.

493
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:32,931
You are not a coward.

494
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:37,143
You lived through something most people
can't even begin to understand.

495
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,940
And by the way, talking to me about it,

496
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:43,942
it's pretty brave.

497
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,195
[man speaking other language]

498
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:10,927
[panicking]

499
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,850
[speaking English] Okay. Okay.

500
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:17,976
Okay, okay, okay.

501
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:24,858
Oh, no.

502
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:31,948
Gideon, we're going to have
to discuss your behavior.

503
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:33,759
[Gideon] While you were resting,

504
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:36,661
I took the liberty of creating
another Hoover and an Edison robot.

505
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:39,831
Both are in the timeline fulfilling
their historically mandated duties.

506
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,542
Good for you,
making sure history stays on track.

507
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:45,920
Now, I think it's time
you take me back home.

508
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:47,797
[Gideon] Home?

509
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:49,507
You're a Time Master now.

510
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,302
This is your home.

511
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:10,195
[device calling]

512
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:13,823
[man on phone] <i>Hello?</i>

513
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,969
Who the hell is this?
Where's receptionist Ava?

514
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,012
[man] <i>Who the hell is this?</i>

515
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:19,204
It's me, Bishop.

516
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:21,705
Is this a prank?

517
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:23,583
Is that you, voice actor Ava?

518
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,418
Your impressions are uncanny.

519
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:27,629
No, listen. It's Bishop.

520
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,297
Okay? This is getting annoying.

521
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,500
How did you get this number?

522
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,175
Why do you sound exactly like me?

523
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:34,886
No, you sound exactly like me.
It's like someone...

524
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,853
No, no, no, no, no.

525
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:48,108
Gideon made a copy of me.

526
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:50,777
Of me?

527
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:54,155
How dare she?
There could only be one me.

528
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,323
[keyboard clacking]

529
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:59,744
Wait a second,
this can't be my actual to-do list.

530
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,247
I pay someone to kidnap a superhero

531
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:04,624
and take them
to a planet called Pliny X19?

532
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,417
What the hell's a Necrian?

533
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,503
The Fountain of Imperium?

534
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:11,756
I try to destroy the world?

535
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:14,717
And the Legends are the good guys?

536
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:23,309
They kidnapped me to give me a chance
to redeem myself, to save the world.

537
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:25,979
Oh, no.

538
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,414
I've been wrong about them
this whole time?

539
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:29,958
[Gideon] You should not be looking
at that information, Captain.

540
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:31,317
Tell me it's not true.

541
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:35,780
Tell me I don't become a bad guy.

542
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:39,159
[Gideon] Having information about your
own future can be extremely dangerous.

543
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,512
I started Ava Corporation
to make people's lives better.

544
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:42,745
I'm a good guy.

545
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:47,709
Somewhere along the way, I started
using my genius to do terrible things.

546
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,912
[Gideon] You no longer have
to do any of those things.

547
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,606
The Bishop robot will do them for you.

548
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,884
You're saying that robot I spoke to
on the phone will live my life?

549
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:57,676
[Gideon] That is correct.

550
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:02,557
Which means you are free
to fulfill your duty as a Time Master,

551
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:05,602
with me, forever.

552
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:10,690
[exhales heavily]

553
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:13,109
Yo, who's hungry?

554
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:16,529
It was a good day for hunting,
but a bad day for squirrels.

555
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:20,074
And we have enough firewood
to last all night.

556
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:21,659
Who knew Ava was part lumberjack?

557
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:23,953
Yeah, apparently,
when it comes to my anxiety and wood,

558
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,788
the wood's gonna lose every time.

559
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:29,167
That's my girl. Come here.
Man, I have missed you.

560
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:32,670
Mission accomplished.

561
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:36,424
It was really nice not to have
to think about the team for a second.

562
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:37,508
I missed you too,

563
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:40,470
but I really needed
to get some aggression out, you know?

564
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,305
Oh, yeah. Okay, I'll take that.

565
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:45,391
- I was really crazy.
- I know, I've seen that.

566
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,811
The captains look like happy campers,
and we got squirrel for dinner.

567
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:49,938
A real win-win.

568
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:52,732
Wait. Did you say "squirrel"?

569
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,485
Hey.

570
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:58,696
That human experience we had,

571
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:01,366
it was fun, wasn't it?

572
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:03,201
Oh, yes, it was great fun.

573
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:04,901
You know what I just realized?

574
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:09,415
My favorite thing about being human
is being with other humans.

575
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,001
Me too.

576
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:30,311
[man speaking Russian]

577
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:35,984
Hey, you can't just leave us in here.

578
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:38,444
Where?

579
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:41,281
- Hey, hey, hey.
- [mumbling frantically]

580
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:43,157
It's all right.

581
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:45,243
Sorry, it's my fault.

582
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,327
Whose fault?

583
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:49,914
A lad in my infantry unit.
He was my best friend from back home.

584
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,293
Okay, hey.

585
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:54,419
Tell me about him.

586
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:59,048
You do like to talk a lot, don't you?

587
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:00,967
I don't know.

588
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:05,221
Somehow he just managed
to light up a room with a smile.

589
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:09,392
He laughed at all of my terrible jokes.

590
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,395
Never wrote me any letters,

591
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:17,358
only the most...
the most delightful poetry.

592
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:22,363
Sounds like you really cared about him.

593
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:29,662
You loved him, didn't you?

594
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:33,124
Hey.

595
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,250
It's okay.

596
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:37,795
Yeah. Yeah.

597
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:40,465
I loved him.

598
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:44,260
God forgive me,
I loved Alun more than anything.

599
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:49,807
And it broke my heart
seeing how the war dimmed his light.

600
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:56,564
But he was a changed man,
even before my cowardice got him killed.

601
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,024
And seeing your brother,

602
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:02,904
see, it reminds me of how he used to be.

603
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,239
Hopeful.

604
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:10,286
Yes, I loved Alun.

605
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:13,998
And I failed him.

606
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:23,633
You know, actually, Behrad,
the original version, it's a long story.

607
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:26,511
He was a lot like you,

608
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:30,098
a soldier who was forced
to grow up too fast.

609
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:36,646
And I, um, I lost him because of that.

610
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:42,110
For years,
there wasn't a day that went by

611
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:44,612
when I didn't wish
that I had died instead of him.

612
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:47,949
But I was lucky.

613
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:51,411
I found these friends who had my back.

614
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:56,374
And eventually I was able
to save my brother and my parents,

615
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:01,671
and even make the world a better place
for a bunch of people I've never met.

616
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:08,386
So, you're telling me that
a ragtag group of eccentrics,

617
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:12,098
they helped you do all of that?

618
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:13,891
Yeah, believe it or not.

619
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,854
So, even though things
may feel hopeless right now,

620
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:21,023
you've got us.

621
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,736
[speaking Russian]

622
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:35,997
Okay.

623
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,125
Perfect.

624
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:46,924
Don't worry. I'm coming for you guys.

625
00:32:50,303 --> 00:32:51,387
No.

626
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:55,641
[door unlocking]

627
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:58,811
There you are.

628
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:00,813
- Blessed saints.
- You found us.

629
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:03,538
Good news is I think I found the parts
we need to fix the machine.

630
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:04,984
Bravo, my boy, bravo!

631
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:09,530
The bad news is,
it's 1986, we're in Chernobyl,

632
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:11,532
and the meltdown is happening tonight.

633
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,998
I don't understand.

634
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:21,375
What is the significance
of this Chernobyl?

635
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,754
By the 1930s, scientists
had figured out nuclear fission,

636
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:28,049
which led to them creating
nuclear reactors to harness that energy.

637
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:31,677
Lord in heaven, nuclear fission,
they learnt how to split the atom.

638
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:35,056
Yeah, and by 1986,
there are a lot of nuclear reactors

639
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,516
like the one here in Chernobyl.

640
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:39,560
But tonight, a reactor explodes,

641
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,813
and civilians won't be evacuated
for almost two days.

642
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:46,734
People will die, and a lot more
will get radiation sickness.

643
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:48,194
Hang on a second now.

644
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:52,031
You said that the explosion
hasn't happened yet.

645
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:53,365
Yeah.

646
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:55,535
Whoa, whoa!

647
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:58,788
Maybe this is why I am here.

648
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,600
I might not have been able
to save Alun and the boys,

649
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:05,253
but my divine purpose,
maybe this is it, God's will for me,

650
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,505
to save people.

651
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:09,274
- No, no. Hold on, buddy.
- Come back!

652
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:11,926
Hey, hey.
Look, I'm all for hacking history,

653
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:13,946
but if we make that big
of a change to the timeline,

654
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,013
that killer <i>Wa verider</i>
will be right on top of us.

655
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:17,533
It would be worth it
if we can save some lives.

656
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:19,559
Yes, we must save lives.

657
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:23,271
Okay, fine. How do we alert people?

658
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:25,648
I think I know how. Come on.

659
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,608
Okay. [groans]

660
00:34:37,535 --> 00:34:38,911
[sighs]

661
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:41,455
Now that there's a robot version
of me living my life,

662
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:44,792
I'm expendable.

663
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:48,421
I'm a nobody now.

664
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,424
[Gideon] The life of a Time Master
is one of anonymity,

665
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,301
and in some sense, expendability.

666
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:54,927
About as far back as I can remember,

667
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:58,139
I've always wanted
to help the world with my genius.

668
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:03,311
I was convinced the world needed me.

669
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:06,355
[Gideon] You are helping the world
as a Time Master,

670
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:09,108
and you'll start
by thoroughly eliminating the Legends.

671
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:11,193
Right.

672
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:13,404
The Legends.

673
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:17,158
The folks who gave me
a chance to redeem myself

674
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:19,160
after I tried to destroy the world.

675
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:23,247
Yeah, there it is.

676
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,082
Fantastic work again, my boy.

677
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,977
- I'll keep an eye out.
- Good you speak Russian.

678
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:30,296
Yes, well, I picked it up working in
a lab with some Russian scientists.

679
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:31,756
Lovely gentlemen, you know.

680
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,599
But I never thought
I'd be using it for this.

681
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:35,134
Okay, let's try this.

682
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:37,928
- Right, go ahead.
- Okay.

683
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:39,472
[clears throat]

684
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,599
[speaking Russian]

685
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:06,768
- Quickly, let's get out of here.
- Yes, let's get out of here.

686
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:11,045
[man speaking Russian]

687
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:20,971
[exclaims]

688
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:22,598
It worked! Look, everybody's leaving!

689
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:24,534
Yeah, but we won't have time
to run back and warn the gang

690
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:25,827
before that <i>Wa verider</i> shows up.

691
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,813
We will if we drive. Let's see
if I remember how to drive stick.

692
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:31,023
Wow! Wow!

693
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:33,234
Motorcars of the future
are truly fascinating.

694
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:34,485
Come on.

695
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:40,991
Now, will you look at that?

696
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,928
We took a little break
from leading the team,

697
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:44,620
and everything turned out fine.

698
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:46,831
Yeah. The kids are all grown up.

699
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:48,874
[chuckles]

700
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,002
Hey, what's up with those two?

701
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:56,340
I think they got into a fight
with a gooseberry bush and lost.

702
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:04,432
- You don't think that they...
- No.

703
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:05,516
[both laugh]

704
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:09,311
Any sign of them yet?

705
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:12,690
No, I hope they don't
run into any dinosaurs.

706
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:16,736
[Astra] Hey, guys, listen.

707
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:19,113
- [rustling]
- What's that weird noise?

708
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:21,449
According to my audio analysis,

709
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:23,552
it's a straight-four engine
with manual transmission.

710
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:26,216
And the squeaking noise suggests
there's a problem with the clutch.

711
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:36,672
Guess we're not gonna
see those dinosaurs.

712
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:40,259
[speaking indistinctly]

713
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:41,635
Please get the hell out of here.

714
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,721
We're in 1986,
just outside of Chernobyl.

715
00:37:43,888 --> 00:37:44,889
- What?
- What?

716
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,974
The meltdown's gonna happen
in about 20 minutes.

717
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,702
We did make
a small change to the timeline.

718
00:37:48,726 --> 00:37:50,102
Hold on. What did you guys do?

719
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:52,813
We broadcast a message
from a military base

720
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:54,791
informing everyone
that the meltdown was imminent,

721
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:56,175
that they should flee immediately.

722
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:59,361
I wasn't in good conscience gonna leave
without doing something, was I?

723
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:02,281
Okay. While I definitely
understand, you guys,

724
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,700
that's not a small change
to the timeline.

725
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,994
You've potentially affected
thousands of lives...

726
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:09,163
Yeah, and you just
put a huge target on our backs.

727
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:14,105
[Gideon] We have another disturbance
in the timeline, Captain.

728
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:15,795
Where to, Gideon?

729
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:19,381
[Gideon] 1986. The city of Chernobyl
in the Soviet Union.

730
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:21,383
Guess who's causing the disturbance?

731
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:22,885
I doubt that's necessary.

732
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:25,374
[Gideon] Because the Legends
wreak havoc wherever they go.

733
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:27,240
And you can finally end it,
once and for all,

734
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,891
by eliminating them for good.

735
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:32,603
Didn't you say rash actions
add more ripples to the timeline?

736
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,105
Fortunately, we're at
an opportune moment in history.

737
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:37,358
Any ripple effect you cause
will be negligible

738
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:39,777
due to its close proximity
to such a catastrophic event.

739
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:40,986
[sighs wearily]

740
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,489
Are you ready to save the timeline
from the Legends, Captain?

741
00:38:58,504 --> 00:38:59,505
What's that noise?

742
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:01,173
- It's the <i>Wa verider.</i>
- Oh, man!

743
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:03,259
You guys need to go
fix that time machine. Now!

744
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:04,718
We need to put out this fire.

745
00:39:04,802 --> 00:39:07,513
Be ready. We have no idea
who or what is on that ship.

746
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:11,559
Now, if we can wire
the magnetic components together...

747
00:39:11,642 --> 00:39:15,896
We can bridge the electric current
from the compass to the ignition coil

748
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,314
and start the machine.

749
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:21,193
Absolutely fantastic work, young lady.
Fantastic! Very well.

750
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:24,405
Hey, Zari.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

751
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,866
You... you wanna talk right now?

752
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:28,552
If I don't get this off my chest,

753
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:30,336
I won't be able
to think about anything else.

754
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:32,162
Go for it. I got it!

755
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:36,542
[exhales]

756
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:38,669
Yes, I want to live
in the Totem with you.

757
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:40,712
You do?

758
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:44,216
Are you sure? You haven't had
a lot of time to think about it.

759
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,342
You don't get it.

760
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:48,220
It doesn't matter where I go,
as long as I'm with you.

761
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:54,560
Uh, yes, we need more wire.

762
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:57,646
Mmm. I got it! This is very us.

763
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,398
- This is so us.
- Yeah.

764
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:07,072
Ah! Here it comes.

765
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:08,741
Not if I stop it first.

766
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,951
Come on. We've gotta go. Let's go!

767
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:16,224
[Gideon] We're right above
the Legends, Captain.

768
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:17,791
Only you can engage our weapons.

769
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:20,586
It's time to prove to me
that you're the man I know you are.

770
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,176
Oh, I'm sorry, Gideon,
I just can't do it!

771
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:29,637
I just can't kill the Legends.

772
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:33,390
Sure, they used me,
but they used me to do good.

773
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:36,235
[Gideon] Please return to your seat
and focus on the mission, Captain.

774
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:38,538
So one of these days, you're gonna
shoot me out the cargo bay,

775
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:39,980
like you did to Time Mistress Ava.

776
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:42,191
And I'd rather die
with a little more dignity.

777
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:43,627
[Gideon] There's nowhere to run!

778
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:45,235
You're wrong about that, Gideon!

779
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:47,446
[Gideon] No, do not go into Section A2.

780
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:01,085
That thing I just said
about dying with dignity...

781
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:02,461
[machine beeping]

782
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,671
I lied.

783
00:41:05,673 --> 00:41:06,757
Dignity is overrated.

784
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:11,136
[screams]

785
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:18,477
Yes!

786
00:41:18,644 --> 00:41:20,104
[screaming]

787
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:24,149
[continues screaming]

788
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,821
[Gary] What is that?

789
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,532
It's coming straight for us.

790
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:32,783
Is that someone on a toilet?

791
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:33,909
Who cares? Let's go!

792
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:35,744
[screaming]

793
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:38,330
Somebody press the red button.

794
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:40,577
Whoever it is,
they're gonna land right on top of us.

795
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:43,585
[screams]

796
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,884
[all] Oh, crap!

797
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:58,809
