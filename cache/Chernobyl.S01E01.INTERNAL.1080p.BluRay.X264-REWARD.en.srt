1
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,501
<i>What is the cost of lies?</i>

2
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:45,588
<i>It's not that we'll mistake them
for the truth.</i>

3
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:49,300
<i>The real danger is that
if we hear enough lies,</i>

4
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:53,012
<i>then we no longer recognize
the truth at all.</i>

5
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:56,015
<i>What can we do then?</i>

6
00:00:56,725 --> 00:00:59,602
<i>What else is left but to abandon
even the hope of truth</i>

7
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:03,398
<i>and content ourselves instead
with stories?</i>

8
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:07,402
<i>In these stories,
it doesn't matter who the heroes are.</i>

9
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:10,447
<i>All we want to know is,
who is to blame?</i>

10
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:15,785
<i>In this story, it was Anatoly Dyatlov.
He was the best choice.</i>

11
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:19,581
<i>An arrogant, unpleasant man,
he ran the room that night.</i>

12
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:20,957
<i>He gave the orders.</i>

13
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:22,709
<i>And no friends.</i>

14
00:01:23,752 --> 00:01:26,504
<i>Or, at least, not important ones.</i>

15
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:33,595
<i>And now, Dyatlov will spend the next
10 years in a prison labor camp.</i>

16
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:37,474
<i>Of course, that sentence
is doubly unfair.</i>

17
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:42,437
<i>There were far greater criminals
than him at work.</i>

18
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,317
<i>And as for what Dyatlov did do...</i>

19
00:01:47,984 --> 00:01:49,903
<i>The man doesn't deserve prison.</i>

20
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:53,031
<i>He deserves death.</i>

21
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,840
But instead, ten years
for "criminal mismanagement."

22
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,343
What does that mean?

23
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:15,512
No one knows.

24
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:17,597
It doesn't matter.

25
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:22,018
What does matter is that, to them,

26
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:25,313
justice was done.

27
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:28,942
Because, you see, to them,

28
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:32,862
a just world is a sane world.

29
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:38,409
There was nothing sane
about Chernobyl.

30
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,622
What happened there,
what happened after,

31
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:46,125
even the good we did, all of it...

32
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:48,878
All of it...

33
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:51,714
Madness.

34
00:02:56,386 --> 00:03:00,181
Well, I've given you
everything I know.

35
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:04,519
They'll deny it, of course.

36
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:06,437
They always do.

37
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:13,862
I know you'll try your best.

38
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:39,252
Lyudmilla?

39
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:05,987
Comrade Dyatlov!

40
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:14,078
Comrade Dyatlov! Comrade Dyatlov!

41
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,836
Comrade Dyatlov! Comrade Dyatlov!

42
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:23,921
What just happened?

43
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:25,756
I don't know.

44
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,200
There's a fire in the turbine hall.

45
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:32,847
The turbine hall?

46
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,267
The control system tank. Hydrogen.

47
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:39,145
You and Toptunov,
you morons blew the tank.

48
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,397
- No, that's not...
- This is an emergency.

49
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,524
Everyone stay calm.
Our first priority is...

50
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:44,650
- It's exploded!
- We know.

51
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:46,545
Akimov, are we cooling
the reactor core?

52
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,729
We shut it down,
but the control rods are still active.

53
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:50,382
They're not all the way in.
I disengaged...

54
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:53,006
All right. Try and disconnect
the servos from the standby console.

55
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:54,511
You two, get the backup pumps running.

56
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,329
We need water moving through the core.

57
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,414
- That is all that matters.
- There is no core.

58
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,459
It exploded! The core exploded.

59
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:07,089
He's in shock. Get him out of here.

60
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:08,591
The lid is off.

61
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,676
The stack is burning. I saw it.

62
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,554
You're confused.
RBMK reactor cores don't explode.

63
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,014
- Akimov...
- Sasha.

64
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:18,309
Don't worry, we did everything right.
Something strange has happened.

65
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,685
- Do you taste metal?
- Akimov!

66
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:23,582
Comrade Perevozchenko, what you're
saying is physically impossible.

67
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:26,317
The core can't explode.
It has to be the tank.

68
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:29,403
We're wasting time. Let's go.

69
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:32,459
Get the hydrogen out of the generators
and pump water into the core.

70
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:33,866
What about the fire?

71
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:35,993
Call the fire brigade.

72
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,599
- Is this Military Fire Station 2?
- Yes.

73
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:42,417
What's happening with the accident?

74
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:46,272
Explosion in the main building
between the third and fourth blocks.

75
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,692
- Are there people there?
- Yes.

76
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:51,277
Wake up the bosses. Call them.

77
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:54,071
I already called mine.

78
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:58,492
Wake them up, wake them up.
Wake up the entire officers' block.

79
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,538
- Fire department.
- Hello, Ivankov?

80
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,458
- Yes. Yes?
- You've been called to Pripyat.

81
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,335
- Hello?
- Yes. Yes I can hear you.

82
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:11,005
At the nuclear plant over there,
in the third and fourth blocks.

83
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,131
The roof is on fire.

84
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:14,550
You're not on call tonight.

85
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,635
They're bringing everybody in,
military and civil.

86
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:20,222
Pripyat, Polesskoe, Kiev.

87
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,099
This is a big one.

88
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,520
But it doesn't look right, the color.

89
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:29,940
Pravik says he thinks they're shining
floodlights or something.

90
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:31,400
And what if there are chemicals?

91
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:33,611
"Chemicals"?

92
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:35,988
The problem's the roof.

93
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:37,531
It's covered in tar,

94
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:40,451
so it's gonna burn all night,
and it'll stink like hell.

95
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,329
That's it. That's the worst of it.

96
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:46,957
Go back to bed.

97
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:25,204
- Is it war?
- Where's the dosimeter?

98
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:28,332
Here. Here.

99
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:36,465
Are they bombing?

100
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:42,263
What the fuck is this?
It's 3.6 roentgen.

101
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,807
That's as high as it goes.
The good one's locked in a safe.

102
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,225
I don't have a key.

103
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:50,187
Valera... Your face.

104
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:53,399
Come on.

105
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:56,360
I'm going to find Khodemchuk
in the pump room.

106
00:12:56,444 --> 00:12:57,945
You, here.

107
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:01,949
Get Shashenok. He's in 604. Go.

108
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:03,784
We need to get everyone out!

109
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:18,674
Shit.

110
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,051
Hey! We need to get
to the reactor hall.

111
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:24,054
- The lift's destroyed.
- Up two flights and across.

112
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,974
- Right.
- Why are you going there?

113
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,329
Have you seen Khodemchuk?

114
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:51,248
- No. Where's Viktor?
- Still in the pump room.

115
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:55,586
Stay here. I'll come back.

116
00:13:58,589 --> 00:13:59,965
Viktor!

117
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,527
Viktor.

118
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,112
Viktor.

119
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:23,906
Oh!

120
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:26,492
Viktor, I'm gonna get you out of here.

121
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,911
Can you stand?

122
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,038
Khodemchuk...

123
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,206
Where?

124
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:36,627
Get Khodemchuk.

125
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,590
I dropped the control rods
from the other panel.

126
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:24,466
- They're still up.
- What?

127
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,870
They're still only a third
of the way in. I don't know why.

128
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:28,238
I already sent the trainees down

129
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,656
to the reactor hall
to lower them by hand.

130
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,658
- What about the pumps?
- I can't get through to Khodemchuk.

131
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:34,226
- The lines are down.
- Fuck the phones and fuck Khodemchuk.

132
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:35,954
- Are the pumps on or not?
- Stolyarchuk?

133
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:38,772
My control panel's not working.
I tried calling for the electricians.

134
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:42,568
I don't give a shit about the panel!
I need water in my reactor core!

135
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:45,491
Get down there
and make sure those pumps are on.

136
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:47,823
Now!

137
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:57,082
What does the dosimeter say?

138
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,543
Uh, 3.6 roentgen, but that's as high
as the meter...

139
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:01,879
Three point six.
Not great, not terrible.

140
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:11,680
We did everything right.

141
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,435
You, connect those hooks!

142
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,567
Get the pumps going!

143
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:07,778
Yeah, over here!
I'm right with you!

144
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:14,535
We're working bottom to top.
Go in fast.

145
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:36,515
Vasily...

146
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:41,311
- Hey, Vasily, what's this?
- I don't know, Misha.

147
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,522
Don't fuck around with it.
Hook these up. Come on.

148
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:50,738
Do you taste metal?

149
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,949
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.

150
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,553
The valves, Misha.
The valves! Let's go.

151
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:58,954
The valves! Come on!

152
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:32,446
What do you need?

153
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:35,157
We need to get into the reactor hall

154
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,160
to lower the control rods,
but the door's jammed.

155
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:40,788
I don't think there are control rods.

156
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,247
I don't think there's a core.

157
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,168
No, you're... You're mistaken.

158
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,378
Akimov said.

159
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:06,939
Let's go.

160
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,204
No!

161
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:25,916
Ignatenko, get on his hose!

162
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,876
It's all right. Breathe.

163
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,211
Misha.

164
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,463
All right, all right.
Easy, Misha.

165
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:09,710
Are you sure?

166
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:12,880
Akimov...

167
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:27,853
Move.

168
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,740
Come on! Go! Go!

169
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:44,870
Go! Go fast, go!

170
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:19,655
Let's go!

171
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:21,865
Let's go!

172
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,327
Hey!

173
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:32,960
Hey!

174
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,607
Lyudmilla! Do you want
to come with us?

175
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,150
Come where?

176
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,475
We're going to the railroad bridge
to get a better look.

177
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:01,863
It's not like anyone
can sleep with all the sirens.

178
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:04,157
I don't think you should go.
It could be dangerous.

179
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,441
What do you mean, "dangerous"?

180
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:07,261
It's a fire.
It's over there, we're over here.

181
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,870
- Mikhail.
- What?

182
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:12,457
Oh. Sorry.

183
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:18,922
- Is Vasily...
- Yeah.

184
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:21,133
Did he say it was bad?

185
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:23,093
No. No, he said it was just the roof.

186
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,554
Well, he's never gotten hurt before.
None of the boys have.

187
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:28,223
He'll be fine.

188
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:30,976
Get some rest.

189
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,240
The tank, it's big enough.

190
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:48,118
This kind of explosion,
the control tank on 71,

191
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,453
it's 100 cubic meters.

192
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:50,954
One hundred and ten.

193
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:54,541
Hundred and ten.
It could do this, definitely.

194
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,126
It's gone.

195
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,503
I looked right into it.

196
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,922
I looked into the core.

197
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,051
Did you lower the control rods or not?

198
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:08,847
Take him to the infirmary.

199
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,018
Toptunov, take him!

200
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:17,981
Where's Kudryavstev?

201
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,025
He fell.

202
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,986
- I need a medic! Anyone!
- He's delusional.

203
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:25,906
- His face...
- Ruptured condenser lines.

204
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:29,117
The feed water is mildly contaminated.
He'll be fine. I've seen worse.

205
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:31,995
Do we still have
a phone line to the outside?

206
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:35,582
Akimov?

207
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,335
Call in the day shift.

208
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:40,796
But if the...

209
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,631
We have to keep water flowing
into the core.

210
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:45,550
We need electricians,
mechanics, we need bodies.

211
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,386
How many times do I have to say it?

212
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:59,272
I'm going to
the Administration Building now

213
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,233
to call Bryukhanov and Fomin.

214
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,303
They're gonna want a full report.

215
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,989
Now, I don't know if I can
make things better for you...

216
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:10,909
But I can certainly make them worse.

217
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,373
Call in the day shift, Comrade Akimov.

218
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:21,503
Yes, Comrade Dyatlov.

219
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:56,163
You're doing fine.

220
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:58,582
Raise her up.

221
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:05,797
That one, maybe an hour.
This one, not until morning.

222
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:10,302
How's it downstairs, Doctor?

223
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:11,970
Quiet.

224
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:13,889
Always is.

225
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:16,600
Nothing at this hour but babies.

226
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,604
Do you know I once went
two days without sleep?

227
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:23,565
Ten women went into labor
at the same time.

228
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:26,067
- Did I ever tell you that story?
- Yes.

229
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,280
Well, I won't need you
in here for a while.

230
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:32,782
If you want,
get some rest in the break room.

231
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,702
They haven't brought
anyone in from the fire.

232
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:37,245
What fire?

233
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:38,830
The power plant.

234
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:42,751
Oh.
Well, then it mustn't be too bad.

235
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,295
Do we stock iodine?

236
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:47,756
- Hmm?
- Iodine.

237
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:50,634
You mean disinfectant?

238
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:53,303
No, pills. Does the hospital
stock iodine pills?

239
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:56,056
Iodine pills?
Why would we have iodine pills?

240
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,153
Hello?

241
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:12,697
Hello?

242
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:21,665
Who else knows this?

243
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:25,168
Have you called Fomin?

244
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:31,132
Of course, I want you to call him.
If I'm up, he's up.

245
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:12,924
Whatever the cause, the important
thing is that neither you nor I.

246
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:56,551
I take it the safety test
was a failure.

247
00:27:56,968 --> 00:27:59,596
- We have the situation under control.
- "Under control"?

248
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:01,490
It doesn't look
like it's under control.

249
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:02,515
Shut up, Fomin.

250
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,820
I have to tell the Central Committee
about this. Do you realize that?

251
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:08,908
I have to get on the phone
and tell Maryin,

252
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,442
or, God forbid, Frolyshev,
that my power plant is on fire.

253
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,944
No one can blame you for this,
Director Bryukhanov.

254
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,505
Of course no one can
blame me for this.

255
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,657
How can I be responsible?
I was sleeping.

256
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,619
Tell me what happened, quickly.

257
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:27,749
We ran the test exactly as
Chief Engineer Fomin approved.

258
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:31,002
Unit Shift Chief Akimov
and Engineer Toptunov

259
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:32,921
encountered technical difficulties,

260
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:36,257
leading to an accumulation of hydrogen
in the control system tank.

261
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:38,635
It regrettably ignited,

262
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,845
damaging the plant,
setting the roof on fire.

263
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,766
The tank is quite large.

264
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,143
It's the only logical explanation.

265
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:51,022
Of course,
Deputy Chief Engineer Dyatlov

266
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:55,026
was directly supervising the test,
so he would know best.

267
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,986
A hydrogen tank, fire...

268
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:01,658
- Reactor?
- We're taking measures to ensure

269
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,701
a steady flow of water
through the core.

270
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:07,414
- What about radiation?
- Obviously, down here it's nothing,

271
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:11,584
but in the reactor building,
I'm being told, 3.6 roentgen per hour.

272
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:14,271
Well, that's not great,
but it's not horrifying.

273
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:15,296
Not at all.

274
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:17,757
From the feed water, I assume.

275
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:18,842
Mmm-hmm.

276
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:23,596
We'll have to limit shifts to
six hours at a time, but otherwise...

277
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,266
The dosimetrists
should be checking regularly.

278
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:30,437
Have them use
the good meter from the safe.

279
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:32,772
Right.

280
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,233
I'll call Maryin.

281
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,862
Have them wake up the local
Executive Committee.

282
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,321
There'll be orders coming down.

283
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:47,537
Here.

284
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,623
Sure? Okay.

285
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,420
What do you think makes the colors?

286
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:56,504
Oh.

287
00:29:57,172 --> 00:30:00,341
- It's the fuel, for sure.
- "It's the fuel, for sure."

288
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:03,761
What do you know about it?
You clean floors at a train station.

289
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:05,847
My friend, Yuri,
works at the power plant.

290
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,056
He says it runs cold.

291
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,309
No gas, no fire. Just atoms.

292
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:12,911
Yuri says the only thing is,
you can't walk right up to the fuel.

293
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:15,690
If you do, a glass of vodka
an hour for four hours.

294
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,109
Isn't Yuri a plumber?

295
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,904
At the nuclear power plant, yeah.

296
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:28,870
Well, it is beautiful.

297
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:31,247
Yeah.

298
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:24,611
Do you have a cigarette?

299
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:51,804
Do you need help?

300
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,771
It's over.

301
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,796
We've done all we can
from the perimeter.

302
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,599
We need to start making
our way to the roof.

303
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:16,723
Vasily!

304
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,433
You've gotta put it out.

305
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:25,273
That's enough, comrades.
We're pushing ahead.

306
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:32,155
Come on, boys.

307
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:40,329
Vasily,
it's just past, straight up.

308
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:42,373
All the way up, all the way in.

309
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:45,460
Come on!

310
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,891
Yeah. Going in now.

311
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:49,065
What about the auxiliary?

312
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:52,860
The pumps are gone, electrical's gone.

313
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:54,904
The core?

314
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:57,323
I didn't go in there, and I won't.

315
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:00,636
I think it's time we faced...

316
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,970
No, we have to get water into
the core.

317
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,354
Otherwise, there'll be a meltdown.

318
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,581
We have to open the valves.

319
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,667
- Sasha...
- What do you want, Boris?

320
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,978
If it's true, then we're dead.
A million people are dead.

321
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,202
Is that what you need to hear?

322
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:15,174
We have to open the valves.

323
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:16,759
- By hand.
- By hand?

324
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:20,322
The number of valves,
the amount of time to turn them,

325
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:21,973
you're talking about hours in there!

326
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:23,641
- Then help us.
- Help you do what?

327
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,477
Pump water into a ditch?
There's nothing there!

328
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,572
Leonid, I'm begging you.

329
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:52,739
Watch the panel while we're gone.

330
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:54,338
It's not working.

331
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:56,632
Just watch it.

332
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:21,125
I guess we know why
they called us in early.

333
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:23,117
Is anyone saying what happened?

334
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,870
They were running
the safety test on the turbines,

335
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:27,997
blew the control system tank.

336
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:30,773
It doesn't make sense to me either.

337
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:33,628
What about sabotage?

338
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:35,755
A bomb?

339
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:38,049
Sitnikov!

340
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:40,843
Bryukhanov wants us to use
the good dosimeter,

341
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:43,638
but it's in the safe,
and we can't find the key.

342
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:45,681
It's in Building Two. Hasn't...

343
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:48,100
Follow me.

344
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:01,280
Gentlemen, welcome.

345
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:04,909
Please, uh, find a seat.
Plenty of room.

346
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:07,745
I apologize for the lateness
of the hour.

347
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:12,208
Rest assured,
we are all very safe down here.

348
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:15,503
We built this shelter
to withstand a nuclear attack

349
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:18,464
by the Americans,
so, I think we'll be fine.

350
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:22,885
Um, as you can see,
we have experienced an accident.

351
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:25,596
A large control tank malfunctioned,

352
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,600
damaging reactor Building Four
and starting a fire.

353
00:38:29,684 --> 00:38:33,229
Now, I have spoken directly
to Deputy Secretary Maryin.

354
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:35,439
Maryin spoke
to Deputy Chief Frolyshev,

355
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:38,567
Frolyshev to Central Committee
member Dolgikh,

356
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:42,154
and Dolgikh to
General Secretary Gorbachev.

357
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:43,739
Now...

358
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:49,662
Because the Central Committee
has the greatest respect

359
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:53,290
for the work of the Pripyat
Executive Committee,

360
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:57,169
they have asked me to brief you
on matters as they stand, so...

361
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:00,715
First, the accident...

362
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:02,758
It's well under control.

363
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:08,347
And second, because the efforts
of the Soviet nuclear industry

364
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:11,809
are considered key State secrets,
it is important

365
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:17,440
that we ensure that this incident
has no adverse consequences.

366
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:19,442
Now, to prevent a panic,

367
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:21,861
the Central Committee have ordered

368
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:24,530
a detachment of military police
to Pripyat.

369
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:26,198
How large of a detachment?

370
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:29,785
Between 2,000 and 4,000 men.

371
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:33,789
What's really going on here?

372
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:36,083
How dangerous is this?

373
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:40,129
There's mild radiation,
but it's limited to the plant itself.

374
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:42,298
- No, it isn't.
- Excuse me?

375
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:46,093
You saw men outside vomiting.

376
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:48,763
You saw men with burns.

377
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:52,027
There's more radiation
than they're saying.

378
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,852
We have wives here, we have children.

379
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:57,563
I say we evacuate the town.

380
00:39:58,522 --> 00:39:59,523
Gentlemen...

381
00:39:59,857 --> 00:40:03,235
Please... Please! My wife is here.

382
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:07,281
Do you think I would keep her
in Pripyat if it wasn't safe?

383
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:11,118
Bryukhanov, the air is glowing.

384
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:12,286
The Cherenkov effect.

385
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:16,290
Completely normal phenomenon.
It can happen with minimal radiation.

386
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:30,137
I wonder how many of you
know the name of this place.

387
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:35,434
We all call it "Chernobyl," of course.

388
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:38,854
What is its real name?

389
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:43,692
The Vladimir I. Lenin
Nuclear Power Station.

390
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:45,945
Exactly.

391
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:51,283
Vladimir I. Lenin.

392
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:02,128
And how proud he would be
of you all tonight.

393
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:05,756
Especially you, young man,

394
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:09,426
and the passion you have
for the people.

395
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:14,431
For is that not the sole purpose
of the apparatus of the State?

396
00:41:16,684 --> 00:41:18,227
Sometimes, we forget.

397
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:21,897
Sometimes, we fall prey to fear.

398
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:27,611
But our faith in Soviet socialism

399
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:30,781
will always be rewarded.

400
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:37,580
Now, the State tells us
the situation here is not dangerous.

401
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:40,291
Have faith, comrades.

402
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:45,462
The State tells us
it wants to prevent a panic.

403
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:46,922
Listen well.

404
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:54,138
It's true, when the people see
the police, they will be afraid.

405
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,641
But it is my experience

406
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:01,145
that when the people ask questions

407
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:03,397
that are not
in their own best interest...

408
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:08,652
They should simply be told
to keep their minds on their labor,

409
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:11,906
and leave matters of the State

410
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:14,200
to the State.

411
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:17,953
We seal off the city.

412
00:42:19,455 --> 00:42:20,706
No one leaves.

413
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:23,459
And cut the phone lines.

414
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:26,503
Contain the spread of misinformation.

415
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:32,593
That is how we keep the people

416
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:35,304
from undermining the fruits
of their own labor.

417
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:39,975
Yes, comrades.

418
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:45,189
We will all be rewarded
for what we do here tonight.

419
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:51,445
This is our moment to shine.

420
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:05,542
Thank you.

421
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:20,933
Comrade Sitnikov to see
the Chief Engineer.

422
00:43:34,196 --> 00:43:35,197
Well?

423
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,124
I sent my dosimetrists
into the reactor building.

424
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:48,353
The large dosimeter from the safe,

425
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:50,129
the one with
the 1,000-roentgen capacity...

426
00:43:50,212 --> 00:43:51,213
What was the number?

427
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:56,010
There was none.

428
00:43:56,385 --> 00:43:58,512
The meter burned out
the second it was turned on.

429
00:43:59,722 --> 00:44:00,723
It's typical.

430
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:01,950
See, this is what Moscow does.

431
00:44:01,974 --> 00:44:04,893
Sends us shit equipment,
then wonders why things go wrong.

432
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:08,522
We found another dosimeter,
from the military fire department.

433
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:12,002
It only goes to 200 roentgen,
but it's better than the small ones.

434
00:44:12,026 --> 00:44:13,027
And?

435
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:15,696
It maxed out.

436
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:17,781
Two-hundred roentgen.

437
00:44:20,743 --> 00:44:22,161
What game are you playing?

438
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:23,829
No, I.

439
00:44:24,455 --> 00:44:26,540
I asked him.
He took multiple measurements.

440
00:44:26,874 --> 00:44:27,916
He's my best man.

441
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,627
It's another faulty meter.
You're wasting our time.

442
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:32,755
I checked the meter
against the control.

443
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:35,049
What's wrong with you?
How'd you get that number

444
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:37,051
from feed water leaking
from a blown tank?

445
00:44:40,346 --> 00:44:41,347
You don't.

446
00:44:41,972 --> 00:44:43,766
Then what the fuck
are you talking about?

447
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,271
I

448
00:44:52,149 --> 00:44:54,902
I walked around the exterior
of Building Four.

449
00:44:56,737 --> 00:44:59,490
I think there's graphite
on the ground in the rubble.

450
00:45:00,908 --> 00:45:02,284
You didn't see graphite.

451
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:04,828
- I did.
- You didn't.

452
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:09,792
You didn't! Because it's not there!

453
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:12,419
What?

454
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:15,172
Are you suggesting the core...

455
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:17,633
What, exploded?

456
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:21,428
Yes.

457
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:31,438
Sitnikov.

458
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:34,441
You're a nuclear engineer. So am I.

459
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:40,572
So please tell me how
an RBMK reactor core explodes.

460
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:44,827
Not a meltdown, an explosion.

461
00:45:45,828 --> 00:45:47,037
I'd love to know.

462
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,081
I can't.

463
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:51,333
Are you stupid?

464
00:45:53,085 --> 00:45:54,086
No.

465
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,546
Then why can't you?

466
00:45:57,381 --> 00:45:58,382
I

467
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:03,095
I don't see how it could explode...

468
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:06,348
But it did.

469
00:46:06,432 --> 00:46:07,433
Enough!

470
00:46:08,016 --> 00:46:09,685
I'll go up to the vent block roof.

471
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:12,438
From there, you can look right
down into reactor Building Four.

472
00:46:12,646 --> 00:46:13,772
I'll see it with my own...

473
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:16,900
My own eyes.

474
00:46:22,656 --> 00:46:23,866
I apologize.

475
00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:27,244
Guards! Guards!

476
00:46:28,662 --> 00:46:31,623
Get him to a medic, or the hospital!
Whatever he needs!

477
00:46:48,265 --> 00:46:51,018
The feed water.
Been around it all night.

478
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:54,730
You go, then.

479
00:46:58,484 --> 00:46:59,485
What?

480
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:02,488
Go to the vent block roof
and report back what you see.

481
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:03,572
No.

482
00:47:07,534 --> 00:47:08,994
No, I won't do that.

483
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:11,246
Of course you will.

484
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:17,461
You'll be fine.

485
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:19,379
You'll see.

486
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:21,590
Come on.

487
00:48:03,966 --> 00:48:04,967
Okay.

488
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:07,970
Let's begin.

489
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:17,479
Leonid.

490
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:22,818
Leonid.

491
00:48:31,535 --> 00:48:32,619
It's all the way, okay?

492
00:48:33,662 --> 00:48:35,080
All the way open.

493
00:48:44,673 --> 00:48:45,674
I'm sorry.

494
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:51,305
There's nothing to be sorry for.

495
00:48:52,014 --> 00:48:54,766
I told you. We did nothing wrong.

496
00:48:57,686 --> 00:48:58,812
But we did.

497
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:02,788
Get everyone in the
infirmary up there.

498
00:52:47,374 --> 00:52:48,375
Hello?

499
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:50,585
- <i>Valery Legasov?</i>
- Yes.

500
00:52:50,669 --> 00:52:53,171
<i>You are the Legasov who is
the First Deputy Director</i>

501
00:52:53,255 --> 00:52:55,757
<i>of the Kurchatov Institute
of Atomic Energy?</i>

502
00:52:55,841 --> 00:52:58,041
- I am. Who am I speaking...
<i>- This is Boris Shcherbina,</i>

503
00:52:58,426 --> 00:53:00,428
<i>Deputy Chairman of
the Council of Ministers</i>

504
00:53:00,512 --> 00:53:02,597
<i>and head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.</i>

505
00:53:03,515 --> 00:53:06,810
<i>There's been an accident
at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.</i>

506
00:53:07,811 --> 00:53:08,812
How bad is it?

507
00:53:09,479 --> 00:53:11,523
<i>No, no need to panic.
There was a fire.</i>

508
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:14,401
<i>It's mostly put out.
The system control tank exploded.</i>

509
00:53:14,693 --> 00:53:16,361
"Control system tank."

510
00:53:16,695 --> 00:53:17,779
And the core?

511
00:53:18,196 --> 00:53:20,532
<i>We've ordered them
to continuously pump water.</i>

512
00:53:21,241 --> 00:53:23,618
Yes, I see. Any contamination?

513
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:26,788
<i>It's mild. The plant manager,
Bryukhanov, is reporting</i>

514
00:53:26,872 --> 00:53:28,540
<i>3.6 roentgen per hour.</i>

515
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:30,768
That's actually significant.
You should evacuate the...

516
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:34,212
<i>You're an expert on
RBMK reactors, correct?</i>

517
00:53:35,589 --> 00:53:38,216
- Yes. I've studied...
<i>- General Secretary Gorbachev</i>

518
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,969
<i>has appointed a committee
to manage the accident.</i>

519
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:42,470
<i>You're on it.</i>

520
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,181
<i>We'll convene at 2:00 this afternoon.</i>

521
00:53:45,682 --> 00:53:48,810
That late? Forgive me,
but don't you think,

522
00:53:48,894 --> 00:53:50,746
given the amount of radiation,
that it would be...

523
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,899
<i>Legasov, you're on this committee
to answer direct questions</i>

524
00:53:53,982 --> 00:53:56,192
<i>about the function of an RBMK reactor,</i>

525
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:59,446
<i>if they should happen to arise.
Nothing else,</i>

526
00:53:59,654 --> 00:54:01,740
<i>certainly not policy.
Do you understand?</i>

527
00:54:02,324 --> 00:54:04,409
Yes, of course. I didn't mean to...
