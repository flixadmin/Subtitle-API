510
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:43,503
If I wanted to come after you,
I'd have done it by now.

511
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,797
But you think you're gonna need me.

512
00:35:48,299 --> 00:35:51,678
Harrison Wells turned me over to that beast.

513
00:35:51,886 --> 00:35:53,638
He used me like a damn puppet.

514
00:35:54,138 --> 00:35:57,183
So like it or not, we have a common enemy,
you and I.

515
00:35:57,642 --> 00:36:00,728
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a gorilla to hunt.

516
00:36:04,607 --> 00:36:06,859
CAITLIN:
I said be still.

517
00:36:07,026 --> 00:36:08,736
You have three fractured ribs.

518
00:36:08,987 --> 00:36:10,363
I'll be fine.

519
00:36:10,613 --> 00:36:12,865
Dad, you need to rest.

520
00:36:13,032 --> 00:36:15,617
I can't believe Grodd became so violent.

521
00:36:17,411 --> 00:36:19,620
What was his lair like?
Did he eat the banana?

522
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:22,707
Does he like <i>King Kong?</i>
He's more of a <i>Planet of the Apes</i> ape?

523
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:26,711
Uh, terrifying. No. And I didn't ask.

524
00:36:27,086 --> 00:36:28,129
CISCO:
Hmm.

525
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:30,881
You mind if I talk to my daughter alone?

526
00:36:36,052 --> 00:36:39,764
When I was with that gorilla...

527
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:43,727
...I thought: "I'm gonna die down here."

528
00:36:43,893 --> 00:36:46,646
And all I could think about was...

529
00:36:46,855 --> 00:36:49,149
...how you and me were in a fight.

530
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:52,652
Dad, I was so afraid that
something would happen to you.

531
00:36:53,153 --> 00:36:56,740
My life started when you were born.

532
00:36:56,906 --> 00:36:59,075
And sometimes...

533
00:36:59,242 --> 00:37:05,248
...my incredible love for you,
it blinds me, and I forget...

534
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:10,253
I forget what a brilliant
young woman you are.

535
00:37:11,254 --> 00:37:14,466
How you're capable
of making your own decisions.

536
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:22,223
Daddy, I know that everything that you do
is out of love.

537
00:37:22,432 --> 00:37:25,977
So love me enough
to always tell me the truth.

538
00:37:26,227 --> 00:37:27,811
-Yeah?
-Deal. Deal.

539
00:37:28,062 --> 00:37:29,688
Okay.

540
00:37:31,106 --> 00:37:32,107
JOE: Ow.
-Oh.

541
00:37:32,274 --> 00:37:34,276
Oh, my bad.

542
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,820
Oh, my bad. Oh, my God.

543
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:39,280
CAITLIN: Maybe it's a good thing
we didn't catch Grodd.

544
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:40,782
Where would we put him?

545
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:46,079
I mean, the pipeline isn't exactly equipped
to hold a super-intelligent, telepathic gorilla.

546
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:50,833
Joe mentioned that
Grodd called Wells, "Father."

547
00:37:51,459 --> 00:37:54,252
Wells must've ordered Grodd
to come after us.

548
00:37:54,461 --> 00:37:57,630
It's why Grodd didn't kill Joe.

549
00:37:58,005 --> 00:38:03,761
I think Joe was right.
Everything Grodd did, it was just to distract us.

550
00:38:05,721 --> 00:38:07,139
What's going on? You okay?

551
00:38:07,348 --> 00:38:09,975
Just thinking about this headset.

552
00:38:10,518 --> 00:38:12,812
It wasn't strong enough.

553
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:17,817
You could've been killed out there, man.

554
00:38:18,025 --> 00:38:20,027
No, dude, your tech worked.

555
00:38:20,277 --> 00:38:22,822
And it proved that we don't need Wells.

556
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:26,450
The three of us took on Grodd
and rescued Joe.

557
00:38:27,493 --> 00:38:29,954
Together, we can do anything.

558
00:38:31,246 --> 00:38:35,125
Actually, it was the four of us.

559
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,810
BARRY:
Hey.

560
00:38:54,561 --> 00:38:55,645
Hey.

561
00:38:57,147 --> 00:38:58,647
How did you know I was here?

562
00:38:58,856 --> 00:39:01,859
This is your spot.

563
00:39:04,027 --> 00:39:05,779
Yeah, it's a special spot.

564
00:39:06,488 --> 00:39:09,283
It's where I first met the Flash.

565
00:39:10,033 --> 00:39:14,705
All those times, you were standing
right in front of me and I had no idea.

566
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,209
I don't even know you anymore.

567
00:39:21,336 --> 00:39:24,047
Iris, what you were saying to me...

568
00:39:24,214 --> 00:39:26,717
...when I was down in the sewer....

569
00:39:28,051 --> 00:39:30,846
You know why I wasn't afraid?

570
00:39:31,221 --> 00:39:33,348
Because you were there.

571
00:39:34,391 --> 00:39:38,312
Even though I really was scared,
having you there...

572
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,815
...is how I could stand up to Grodd.

573
00:39:42,024 --> 00:39:45,068
Every time I falter...

574
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:48,112
...or make a mistake...

575
00:39:48,613 --> 00:39:52,742
...the thought of you is what picks me up
and keeps me going.

576
00:39:54,076 --> 00:39:56,078
Look, what I'm trying to say is...

577
00:39:56,245 --> 00:40:00,416
...even though you didn't know everything...

578
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:02,627
...about my life this past year...

579
00:40:02,877 --> 00:40:06,339
...that does not mean
that you weren't a part of it.

580
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,091
You were.

581
00:40:09,842 --> 00:40:13,095
Every single day.

582
00:40:14,263 --> 00:40:16,390
Without you...

583
00:40:17,266 --> 00:40:19,769
...there wouldn't be the Flash.

584
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:24,941
I've thought about what you said...

585
00:40:25,274 --> 00:40:27,568
...and maybe you were right.

586
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:30,613
I have been thinking about you...

587
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:32,782
...about us...

588
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,118
...but I can't do that anymore.

589
00:40:36,744 --> 00:40:39,872
Eddie is the man that I live with,
the man that I love...

590
00:40:40,081 --> 00:40:41,415
...and he's still missing.

591
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:43,291
I know.

592
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,961
I'm gonna bring him back.

593
00:40:50,382 --> 00:40:51,925
And after that?

594
00:40:53,969 --> 00:40:55,804
I don't know.

595
00:40:57,138 --> 00:40:59,182
I don't know.

596
00:41:05,647 --> 00:41:06,648
[GRODD GROWLING]

597
00:41:20,996 --> 00:41:23,581
EDDIE: So now what?
-Now...

598
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:27,585
...I have the key.

599
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,256
The key to what?

600
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:57,239
Time to go home.
