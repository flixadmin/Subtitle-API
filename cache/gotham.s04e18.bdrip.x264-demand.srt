Did you see what just happened?

329
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,149
That man's a raving bloody lunatic.
He can't be trusted.

330
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,469
For once, I agree with Alfred.

Bruce, listen to me.

With your help,
we can prevent more deaths.

What's the plan?

334
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,470
Jerome is using
a short-wave radio trigger

335
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,670
with a dead man's switch.

336
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,795
If we can cut the signal,

337
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,536
he won't be able to activate
the explosives.

338
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,880
This emits a powerful signal

339
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,871
that disables all radio waves
close to it.

340
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,951
Once within a few feet
of Jerome's device,

341
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,189
his triggerwill be useless.

342
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,880
It will give us the time
for the snipers

343
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,120
to get a clean shot on Jerome,
Firefly, and the others.

344
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,816
If I wear this, then that gives you
time to take them out?

345
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,910
Correct.

346
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,274
Are you sure it's gonna work?

347
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,229
