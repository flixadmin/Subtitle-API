1
00:00:08,397 --> 00:00:11,148
So, you're-you're not a Fed?

2
00:00:11,149 --> 00:00:13,317
Do you hear that? That's the old bill.

3
00:00:13,318 --> 00:00:15,027
So unless you want to
explain why you've got

4
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:18,155
America's favorite invisible
wanker dead on the floor,

5
00:00:18,156 --> 00:00:20,200
give us a fucking hand, will ya?

6
00:00:23,912 --> 00:00:25,539
Aw, shit.

7
00:00:41,096 --> 00:00:46,017
All right, listen, I
have worked for the Feds.

8
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:48,269
I've worked for loads of people.

9
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,648
I'm what you might call
an independent contractor.

10
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,027
You got a problem, you call
me, I solve the problem.

11
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,039
What is that?

12
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,668
That's a problem.

13
00:01:12,669 --> 00:01:15,421
Oh, thank fuck, he's alive.

14
00:01:15,422 --> 00:01:18,591
Yes, yes, he's alive! Okay, pull over.

15
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,301
No, no, no, Hughie, you
don't fucking get it.

16
00:01:20,302 --> 00:01:22,928
- Pull the car over.
- This is a fucksight worse.

17
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:24,723
He's seen our faces.

18
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,063
Oh, my God.

19
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:33,314
No, no, no, no, no. I can't do this.

20
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:35,317
I can't do this. Let me out.

21
00:01:36,526 --> 00:01:39,779
- Let me out. Pull over!
- Hughie,

22
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,157
you walk away now, and you will
never get payback for Robin.

23
00:01:43,158 --> 00:01:44,575
You'll spend the rest of your life

24
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:46,452
sitting on your ass with fucking regret.

25
00:01:46,453 --> 00:01:47,996
Now, is that what you want?

26
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:58,047
I know a bloke. Top man.

27
00:01:58,048 --> 00:01:59,508
He'll know what to do.

28
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:13,020
Morning, luv.

29
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:15,231
Frenchie about?

30
00:02:21,238 --> 00:02:23,615
Mmm.

31
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:35,334
You'll love this guy.

32
00:02:45,137 --> 00:02:46,762
Frenchie.

33
00:02:46,763 --> 00:02:49,181
Oi, Frenchie.

34
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:54,395
Monsieur Charcuter.

35
00:02:54,396 --> 00:02:56,689
Huh.

36
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,567
This is a surprise.

37
00:02:59,568 --> 00:03:01,193
Good to see you.

38
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:02,988
Good to see you, too, mate.

39
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:08,450
Means you brought
that 40,000 you owe me?

40
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,246
I mean, why else would you
show your face around here?

41
00:03:12,247 --> 00:03:17,543
Because I've got something
even better for you.

42
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:22,047
How would you like to double your money?

43
00:03:30,473 --> 00:03:32,766
The double of zero is zero.

44
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:34,143
Who is he?

45
00:03:34,144 --> 00:03:35,686
This guy?

46
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:37,354
Oh, this here is Hughie Campbell.

47
00:03:37,355 --> 00:03:40,649
We're, uh, working a
little job together.

48
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,776
Ooh.

49
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:46,031
And he's still alive?

50
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:50,451
You and I worked together,
and you're still in one piece.

51
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:52,620
Am I?

52
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:58,001
Look, do you want to know
what the fucking job is or not?

53
00:04:01,463 --> 00:04:03,672
Open it.

54
00:04:03,673 --> 00:04:05,467
Who is in there?

55
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:10,680
Where's your sense
of adventure, Frenchie?

56
00:04:16,686 --> 00:04:19,813
You dumb fucks are fucking dead!

57
00:04:19,814 --> 00:04:21,233
Have you any... Aah!

58
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:26,111
That's Translucent.

59
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:28,155
You got Translucent in your trunk, huh?

60
00:04:28,156 --> 00:04:29,573
Nothing gets past you, mate.

61
00:04:29,574 --> 00:04:32,159
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

62
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,619
Go away. Get him out of here.

63
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,737
All right, all right, easy.

64
00:04:34,738 --> 00:04:36,080
He's chipped.

65
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:37,498
The Supes could be on their way.

66
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:38,999
Homelander could be
on his way right now.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,042
Wait, he's chipped?

68
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:41,293
You bring this to my doorstep?

69
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:43,170
This is not my problem, huh?

70
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:46,591
Well, it is now. He
knows what you look like.

71
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,872
Look, Frenchie, I need your help, mate,

72
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,012
and I ain't leaving till I get it,

73
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:54,307
or till The Seven show up.

74
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:06,026
Ah, here comes the A-Train!

75
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:07,778
My man, how you doing?

76
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:09,698
Look, I brought you something.

77
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,535
- Thanks?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:14,536 --> 00:05:18,580
I'm sorry, I asked for Translucent.

79
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:20,916
Right, but Translucent is on a secret,

80
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:23,043
undercover mission right now.

81
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:25,170
But you got the A-Train, baby.

82
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:31,302
But... my wish was to meet Translucent.

83
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:36,015
That was my only wish. He's my hero.

84
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:41,061
Yeah. Um... well, you
know, maybe he can swing by

85
00:05:41,062 --> 00:05:44,106
next week or some...

86
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:46,109
something...

87
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:50,070
Fuck.

88
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:53,657
Um... you know what?

89
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:55,284
Maybe I can't turn invisible,

90
00:05:55,285 --> 00:05:58,454
but I am the world's fastest man.

91
00:05:58,455 --> 00:06:01,206
Like, I can outrun anybody or anything.

92
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:02,750
That's-that's something, right?

93
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:06,503
Look, I'll tell you
what, you get better,

94
00:06:06,504 --> 00:06:09,089
and I'll teach you to run as fast as me.

95
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,383
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

96
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:13,636
You'll teach me to outrun cancer?

97
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:21,478
Yeah.

98
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:25,022
Oh, my God, turn that off.

99
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,565
How many times do I have to tell you

100
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:27,941
that A-Train needs to be scripted?

101
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:29,401
- Right.
- When he does not have a script,

102
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:31,362
- this is what happens.
- I'm on it. I'm so sorry.

103
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:33,113
- It will not happen again.
- All right.

104
00:06:33,114 --> 00:06:34,323
And where is Translucent?

105
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:35,824
We know he's not in the building.

106
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:37,534
He hasn't triggered any
of the motion sensors.

107
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:39,536
He's probably out on another
one of his fucking benders.

108
00:06:39,537 --> 00:06:41,455
Doesn't he have a
team-up tomorrow night?

109
00:06:41,456 --> 00:06:42,706
Yeah, with the Deep.

110
00:06:42,707 --> 00:06:43,957
- Get a backup.
- I'm on it.

111
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,167
Okay, go.

112
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:47,169
Okay.

113
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,421
Hello?

114
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,677
Black Noir.

115
00:06:55,678 --> 00:06:59,307
We haven't properly
met yet. I'm Starlight.

116
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:08,482
Well...

117
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:11,485
I look forward to working with you.

118
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:13,487
There she is.

119
00:07:13,488 --> 00:07:15,864
Hi. How you settling in?

120
00:07:15,865 --> 00:07:19,201
Well, uh, it's an adjustment.

121
00:07:19,202 --> 00:07:20,494
That's for sure.

122
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:21,870
- This is Trevor...
- Hi.

123
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:23,288
... from Crime Analytics.

124
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:26,041
So, we have exciting news for you.

125
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:28,919
We are sending you on your first patrol.

126
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,296
It's a team-up tomorrow night.

127
00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:33,048
Oh, that's great.

128
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:35,342
That's great news. Thank you.

129
00:07:35,343 --> 00:07:37,219
Hi. Big fan. There you go.

130
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,887
- A crime itinerary?
- Yep.

131
00:07:38,888 --> 00:07:40,431
Where and when to find the bad guys.

132
00:07:40,432 --> 00:07:42,599
That's what my department
does. We vet leads,

133
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,101
crunch satellite data, COMP-STAT.

134
00:07:44,102 --> 00:07:45,686
Better intel than the police.

135
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:47,813
- Mm.
- You know, thanks, but I'm good.

136
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:50,149
I-I like to do my own investigating.

137
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,942
And that is why we love you,

138
00:07:51,943 --> 00:07:53,110
but it's not coming from us.

139
00:07:53,111 --> 00:07:54,862
It's corporate. To protect you.

140
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:56,280
What if you nab the wrong person?

141
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:58,157
There's liability to consider.

142
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:01,410
The-the Deep is coming?

143
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:03,036
Yeah, it's a water-adjacent crime.

144
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:06,373
Then he should do it
himself. He doesn't need me.

145
00:08:06,374 --> 00:08:08,292
It was gonna be Deep and Translucent,

146
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:12,463
but everyone on 82 is so
excited to get you out there.

147
00:08:12,464 --> 00:08:15,174
Yeah, it's just, uh, you
know, back in Des Moines,

148
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:17,009
I always patrolled alone.

149
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,094
And that is why we love you.

150
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:21,013
But we see at least a 23% uptick

151
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:23,223
in social media mentions
and hero hashtags

152
00:08:23,224 --> 00:08:24,683
when there's a team-up.

153
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:25,726
People love a team-up.

154
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:27,395
- Love a team-up.
- Mm.

155
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:05,224
That stuff really
blocks the chip's signal?

156
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:06,600
Yeah. It's just R.F. Shielding Foil.

157
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:07,717
You can get it at Fry's.

158
00:09:07,718 --> 00:09:09,811
You in tech intelligence?

159
00:09:09,812 --> 00:09:11,189
Uh, sales and installation.

160
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,900
Ah...

161
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:17,611
Oh, what the fuck?

162
00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:19,321
Where am I?

163
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:21,949
Oi. Morning, sunshine.

164
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,034
- You know who I am?
- Not sure.

165
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:26,662
I know so many invisible assholes.

166
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:28,497
You fucking amateurs!

167
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,125
Fuck!

168
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:33,919
What the fuck?!

169
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,420
Ooh, mind them bars, son.

170
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:38,006
You'll only bollocks yourself again.

171
00:09:38,007 --> 00:09:39,424
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

172
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:41,885
Uh, okay, what do you guys want? Money?

173
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:44,847
We don't want your fucking money.

174
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:51,687
What do you think, Frenchie?

175
00:09:51,688 --> 00:09:53,272
You just dropped the Moby fucking Dick

176
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:54,856
of problems on my plate.

177
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:57,776
That's what I think.

178
00:09:57,777 --> 00:09:59,687
Okay?

179
00:09:59,688 --> 00:10:02,698
He can re-order his carbon
on his skin into metamaterial.

180
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:05,409
It's hard as diamonds.

181
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,119
It's nearly impossible to penetrate.

182
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,705
All right, how 'bout we suffocate him?

183
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:11,582
Some Dominicans already tried this,

184
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,250
way back in '07.

185
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:14,918
And what happened?

186
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,169
They're all fucking dead now.

187
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,714
That's what happened.

188
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:20,299
All right, then, fuck it, electrocution.

189
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,550
We'll just increase the amps.

190
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:23,093
You already hit him with enough to drop

191
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:24,803
a water buffalo, and look.

192
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:26,847
Might knock him out. Doesn't
seem to kill him, huh?

193
00:10:26,848 --> 00:10:29,516
No. We need to pierce the skin somehow.

194
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:32,269
Well, how the hell are we gonna do that?

195
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,271
I don't know.

196
00:10:34,272 --> 00:10:35,732
You're gonna kill him?

197
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:40,778
We didn't bring him here
for a fucking Happy Meal.

198
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,948
I don't... I thought we'd
question him or something.

199
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:47,784
I don't know, you get a... you
get ahold of someone this big...

200
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:50,954
At Gitmo, we had to water
board Khalid Sheikh Mohammed

201
00:10:50,955 --> 00:10:55,584
183 times over six months
to get him to talk just once.

202
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:57,252
Now, we ain't got six months.

203
00:10:57,253 --> 00:10:59,672
I doubt we've even got six hours.

204
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:04,885
There are so many crazy things
about what you just said,

205
00:11:04,886 --> 00:11:07,971
but right now, you're
talking about randomly killing

206
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:11,850
one of the most famous
men on the planet.

207
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:13,727
A goddamn national treasure.

208
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:18,106
I mean... people tend to
notice that kind of thing.

209
00:11:18,107 --> 00:11:21,276
And if we let him go...

210
00:11:21,277 --> 00:11:23,487
what do you think The
Seven will do to us?

211
00:11:23,488 --> 00:11:26,073
Hmm?

212
00:11:26,074 --> 00:11:30,203
You can't get A-Train if you're
a greasy smear on the pavement.

213
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:34,456
I'm not a murderer.

214
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:39,419
That's all right.

215
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,839
I am.

216
00:11:43,396 --> 00:11:45,717
The race is coming up
quickly. How you feeling?

217
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:47,886
Look, A-Train is a fierce competitor,

218
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:49,846
but no one can be the
world's fastest man forever.

219
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:51,181
Let's just say I like my chan...

220
00:11:51,182 --> 00:11:52,766
I'll always protect you.

221
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,976
Your little hero will never be afraid

222
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:56,687
with the Junior Homelander Cuddle...

223
00:11:56,688 --> 00:12:00,565
I regret to inform you that I've
located the mayor's Gulfstream.

224
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:03,610
It's about two miles down at
the bottom of Hudson Canyon.

225
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:05,153
There are no survivors,

226
00:12:05,154 --> 00:12:07,739
and I've yet to locate
the flight recorder.

227
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,032
Though the jet was fragmented,

228
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:10,992
there was one engine fully intact,

229
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:12,744
and it appears to be engine failure.

230
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:15,205
So I'd like to offer...

231
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,166
Whoa...

232
00:12:21,003 --> 00:12:23,797
- Still going strong, huh?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

233
00:12:23,798 --> 00:12:25,090
I've just been pumping for 30 minutes,

234
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:26,591
and I got a quarter of an ounce.

235
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:28,802
Hey, hey, go easy on yourself.

236
00:12:28,803 --> 00:12:30,637
Come on, now.

237
00:12:30,638 --> 00:12:34,641
Personally, I think it's
amazing that a woman your age

238
00:12:34,642 --> 00:12:37,728
can have a baby, period.

239
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:40,021
That is so sweet of you to say.

240
00:12:40,022 --> 00:12:42,858
Oh, no problem.

241
00:12:42,859 --> 00:12:44,192
Hey, you found Translucent yet?

242
00:12:44,193 --> 00:12:47,070
- You heard about that?
- Mm-hmm.

243
00:12:47,071 --> 00:12:48,947
No, not yet.

244
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:51,408
Well, you know, I could search for him.

245
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:52,743
Personally.

246
00:12:52,744 --> 00:12:55,036
That's not necessary.

247
00:12:55,037 --> 00:12:56,789
Right.

248
00:12:58,249 --> 00:13:00,752
Hey, did you hear about
the mayor of Baltimore?

249
00:13:03,838 --> 00:13:06,798
Yeah. Yeah.

250
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,425
Heard his plane went down.

251
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:10,343
Some sort of engine trouble.

252
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:11,720
Yeah, it's awful.

253
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:13,013
I saw him on Tuesday.

254
00:13:13,014 --> 00:13:14,723
Had a meeting with him right here.

255
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:16,683
Wow.

256
00:13:16,684 --> 00:13:19,060
Well, hug your kids, right?

257
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:21,229
'Cause you never know what might happen.

258
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,564
- So true.
- Mm.

259
00:13:22,565 --> 00:13:24,733
You know what's interesting?

260
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:27,736
The Deep told me, and only me,

261
00:13:27,737 --> 00:13:30,697
that there were, uh, scorch marks

262
00:13:30,698 --> 00:13:33,241
on the mayor's engine.

263
00:13:33,242 --> 00:13:37,996
Almost as if from two
small, high-intensity beams,

264
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:40,082
roughly the width of human eyes.

265
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:44,796
Say what you mean to say.

266
00:13:46,251 --> 00:13:50,342
Your brand is hope,

267
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:54,013
baseball, America... sunshine.

268
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:56,724
You don't do vengeance.

269
00:13:58,893 --> 00:14:03,021
Madelyn, I heard him
through the wall of this...

270
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:04,481
He was blackmailing you.

271
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:06,691
I am the last person you need to save.

272
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,151
Yeah, but I-I did it for you.

273
00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:11,530
I know, but did the timing occur to you?

274
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:13,907
I have half the Senate
Appropriations Committee

275
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:15,274
coming tonight.

276
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:33,301
How did he even know about Compound V?

277
00:14:33,302 --> 00:14:35,095
We are not going to talk about that.

278
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:36,721
Oh, come on, Madelyn.

279
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:39,516
You do not need to hide things from me.

280
00:14:39,517 --> 00:14:41,309
I love Vought as much as you do,

281
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,479
- and I can do more.
- You can do more?

282
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,983
You've already grossed
$12.3 billion for us.

283
00:14:47,984 --> 00:14:50,610
Right. So the pricks on 82 can
take all the fucking credit?

284
00:14:50,611 --> 00:14:53,029
Empty fucking suits with
Cornell degrees? Come on.

285
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,658
I'm the one who's out there. Not them.

286
00:14:56,659 --> 00:15:02,205
I'm the one who, who-who
knows the audience.

287
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:04,499
Who knows what's good for this company.

288
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,167
I know. I hear you.

289
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:09,129
I do. But what I need right now,

290
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,426
is I need you to charm the
shit out of those congressmen.

291
00:15:14,677 --> 00:15:16,303
Right.

292
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:20,515
'Cause that's all I'm good for, huh?

293
00:15:20,516 --> 00:15:23,143
Smile, look pretty, say my lines.

294
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:25,478
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

295
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:28,065
No. No.

296
00:15:30,936 --> 00:15:34,120
You just need to let me protect you.

297
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,721
- Oh, you're gonna protect me?
- Mm-hmm.

298
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:45,044
Gods are pure

299
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,543
and they're perfect

300
00:15:48,544 --> 00:15:50,962
and they're above it all.

301
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:53,257
And they need to stay that way.

302
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,062
Huh...

303
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:09,774
You're leaking.

304
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:13,027
Thank you.

305
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:49,312
- Hello?
- Hi, Dad.

306
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:52,691
Hughie, where have you been?
I've been calling hospitals.

307
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:54,359
- I'm fine.
- But the police are saying

308
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,860
some wacko drove into Gary's store,

309
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:57,696
right through the
window, and then took off.

310
00:16:57,697 --> 00:17:00,407
I-I thought maybe you've
been hurt, or-or kidnapped.

311
00:17:00,408 --> 00:17:02,492
I saw this Dateline
on human trafficking...

312
00:17:02,493 --> 00:17:04,953
Dad, I haven't been
human trafficked, okay?

313
00:17:04,954 --> 00:17:07,455
I-I closed up early. It must
have happened after I left.

314
00:17:07,456 --> 00:17:09,249
But where'd you go?

315
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,210
Just been drinking at Anthony's.

316
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:15,213
- Blowing off steam.
- No... now, I called Anthony, all right?

317
00:17:15,214 --> 00:17:17,924
I called everybody. No one's
seen you. Don't lie to me.

318
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:20,343
Yeah, it's kind of hard to explain.

319
00:17:20,344 --> 00:17:23,096
Hey, Dad, listen, I got to, I got to go.

320
00:17:23,097 --> 00:17:24,514
Just, l-listen, I
know you've been taking

321
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:26,141
Robin's accident real hard.

322
00:17:26,142 --> 00:17:27,559
- It wasn't an accident.
- All-all right, all right.

323
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,436
My point is, you're a good boy.

324
00:17:29,437 --> 00:17:32,230
You're a sensitive boy. Come home.

325
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:35,650
Okay? Before you do something
stupid, come home, Hughie.

326
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:39,280
- I got to go.
- No, w-wait, Hugh...

327
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:22,447
Oh. Well, I heard we had a meeting.

328
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:25,116
So, um, I'll just leave you to it.

329
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:28,828
Well, we're having a meeting
right now, aren't we, Deep?

330
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:30,456
You and me.

331
00:18:31,874 --> 00:18:34,877
- Come on in.
- Yeah. Sure.

332
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:56,106
So, uh, what, uh...

333
00:18:56,107 --> 00:18:58,733
Or is there, is there
anything I can, can do for you,

334
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:00,193
Homelander?

335
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:03,863
Well, yeah. I-I guess, uh...

336
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:07,492
Well, you can help me
understand something, Deep,

337
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:09,494
'cause, uh...

338
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:12,122
I don't know, maybe I'm stupid.

339
00:19:12,123 --> 00:19:14,582
Am I stupid, Deep?

340
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,584
What? No.

341
00:19:16,585 --> 00:19:19,587
No. You're not stupid.

342
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:23,383
You're-you're smart. Very smart, right?

343
00:19:23,384 --> 00:19:25,009
Yeah. Okay.

344
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,430
So, what possible reason...

345
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:33,268
what, uh, razor-sharp fish instinct...

346
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:36,312
made you run to Stillwell

347
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:39,190
and tell her what you
thought you saw down there?

348
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:42,402
All right, look, I-I thought...
I thought I, I was, uh...

349
00:19:42,403 --> 00:19:45,071
I-I don't even know... I don't
know what I saw down there,

350
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:48,658
as a matter of fact. It was, it
was really dark and, uh, muddy...

351
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:50,285
the water was really muddy.

352
00:19:50,286 --> 00:19:53,079
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.

353
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,540
I-I didn't...

354
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:59,544
I didn't really see anything
down there, as a matter of fact.

355
00:20:01,589 --> 00:20:03,047
That's what I thought.

356
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:05,300
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

357
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,687
And I trust we never have to
have this conversation again.

358
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:20,106
No. Of course not.

359
00:20:20,107 --> 00:20:21,650
Just this once.

360
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:33,061
Now go fuck Shamu in the blowhole.

361
00:20:35,831 --> 00:20:37,833
Yeah.

362
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:26,547
Rounds coated in the same
carbon metamaterial as his skin.

363
00:21:33,806 --> 00:21:35,807
Will it work?

364
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:37,142
Je ne sais pas.

365
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,444
Guys?

366
00:21:48,445 --> 00:21:51,364
What are you doing? Wait!
No, no, no! Wait, wait!

367
00:21:51,365 --> 00:21:52,825
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

368
00:21:55,577 --> 00:21:57,912
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

369
00:21:57,913 --> 00:22:02,125
You stupid, fucking asshole.

370
00:22:02,126 --> 00:22:04,419
I'm invincible.

371
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,878
You stupid motherfuckers.

372
00:22:08,257 --> 00:22:11,092
I'm fucking Translucent.

373
00:22:11,093 --> 00:22:12,960
I'm indestructible.

374
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:15,513
It's only a matter of time
before they come for me.

375
00:22:15,514 --> 00:22:17,349
You're fucking dead!

376
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:24,564
Well, that was great, guys.

377
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:26,025
That was awesome.

378
00:22:28,068 --> 00:22:30,778
Frenchie, back later.

379
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:32,072
Where are you going?

380
00:22:33,741 --> 00:22:38,218
- Got an idea. Long shot, might help.
- Now?

381
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:40,230
Yeah, well, it's all under
control here, isn't it?

382
00:22:40,231 --> 00:22:41,941
Try not to bugger each other.

383
00:22:51,675 --> 00:22:55,511
Ah, fuck me.

384
00:22:55,512 --> 00:22:57,181
Fuck.

385
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:09,901
Oh. Sorry, Ms. Stillwell.

386
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:10,903
Oh...

387
00:23:13,485 --> 00:23:15,094
Are you Anika?

388
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:16,753
Ms. Stillwell, I didn't
know that you were...

389
00:23:16,754 --> 00:23:18,438
You look really nice.

390
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,090
Thank you. Could you please show me?

391
00:23:20,091 --> 00:23:22,672
Yeah. We haven't been able
to ping Translucent's chip

392
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:24,924
- until about five minutes ago.
- Well, where is he?

393
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:26,551
Jersey City.

394
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:28,553
What the hell is he
doing in Jersey City?

395
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:31,347
Uh... well, he's somewhere
in this ten-block area.

396
00:23:31,348 --> 00:23:32,974
That is the best you can do?

397
00:23:32,975 --> 00:23:34,475
It's possible the chip's glitching,

398
00:23:34,476 --> 00:23:36,477
- or there's some kind of interference...
- Okay.

399
00:23:36,478 --> 00:23:39,981
Tell security to search the
area, door-to-door if necessary.

400
00:23:39,982 --> 00:23:41,607
But tell them to be discreet.

401
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:44,277
He is invisible, so it
shouldn't be that hard.

402
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:45,571
Okay.

403
00:23:50,284 --> 00:23:52,785
Oh, wow. What a surprise.

404
00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:54,370
A water crime.

405
00:23:54,371 --> 00:23:56,038
Fuck me running. I swear to God,

406
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,541
they only call me when
there's trouble at a dock.

407
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:02,628
Or a river or a lake, canal.

408
00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:05,172
A jetty.

409
00:24:05,173 --> 00:24:09,176
Fucking idiots. I could be
doing so much more.

410
00:24:09,177 --> 00:24:11,804
But no, Vought just wants me
to make my big pretty dives

411
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:14,974
into the water and flash my
fucking biceps for Instagram.

412
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:17,351
I mean, sure, four million
hits a day, but still,

413
00:24:17,352 --> 00:24:19,770
it's fucking demeaning.

414
00:24:21,982 --> 00:24:23,816
What's your problem?

415
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:26,278
You've had that pissy look
on your face all night.

416
00:24:30,032 --> 00:24:33,576
Ooh. What... ?

417
00:24:33,577 --> 00:24:35,661
Is this about the other night again?

418
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:40,458
Jesus Christ.

419
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:42,460
Cry me a fucking river, all right?

420
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:44,754
I took my share of shit
when I first got here, okay?

421
00:24:44,755 --> 00:24:48,633
Besides, you had a
crush on me, remember?

422
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:51,469
That gives you no right... zero right...

423
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,721
to do what you did,
you pathetic asshole.

424
00:24:53,722 --> 00:24:56,891
- Hey. You shut your fucking mouth.
- Or what?

425
00:24:56,892 --> 00:24:58,809
You'll sic a grouper on me?

426
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:01,020
I'll tell everyone you're a psycho.

427
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:03,522
- I'll go to Homelander.
- No, you won't.

428
00:25:03,523 --> 00:25:06,817
See, I asked around; you're
not number two around here.

429
00:25:06,818 --> 00:25:09,445
You're just the fish guy.

430
00:25:09,446 --> 00:25:11,781
Everyone thinks you're a joke.

431
00:25:11,782 --> 00:25:14,075
Me, most of all.

432
00:25:14,076 --> 00:25:18,162
I cannot believe I fell for your crap.

433
00:25:18,163 --> 00:25:22,583
- You stuck-up little...
- You ever touch me again,

434
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:25,462
I will burn your eyes out.

435
00:25:27,881 --> 00:25:30,508
Understand me?

436
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,351
We'll finish this later.

437
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,105
You take them from the front,
I'll come in from behind.

438
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,626
I'll always...

439
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:10,590
Hey.

440
00:26:18,557 --> 00:26:19,975
Hey, boys.

441
00:26:26,982 --> 00:26:29,608
Hurry up. Move faster.

442
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:32,403
You're amazing. That was so
great. That was really good.

443
00:26:32,404 --> 00:26:34,303
- Smile for the cameras.
- What? What the hell is this?

444
00:26:34,304 --> 00:26:36,282
Yeah, stand over him
and say "This is lit."

445
00:26:36,283 --> 00:26:38,159
Oh, hey, Jimmy.

446
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,704
Catch my dive in the water?
It was fucking cherry.

447
00:26:41,705 --> 00:26:42,831
Nice.

448
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:48,378
Smile at the camera, Starlight.

449
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:00,264
Congrats on your promotion, Susan.

450
00:27:00,265 --> 00:27:03,225
Jesus Christ. Butcher.

451
00:27:03,226 --> 00:27:06,061
Madam Deputy Director, eh?

452
00:27:06,062 --> 00:27:10,399
Wow. Andrew and the kids
must be chuffed for you.

453
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,735
Keep your voice down, and
don't talk about my family.

454
00:27:12,736 --> 00:27:14,904
It makes my skin crawl.

455
00:27:14,905 --> 00:27:16,489
What are you doing here?

456
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:20,201
Just need a quick dekko
at some of your files.

457
00:27:20,202 --> 00:27:23,496
- My files? What files?
- A couple of Supes.

458
00:27:23,497 --> 00:27:25,539
Big Game, Shout Out.

459
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,541
Translucent, if you got him.

460
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:29,251
- Why Translucent?
- Eh, nothing special,

461
00:27:29,252 --> 00:27:31,337
- just ticking a few boxes.
- Oh.

462
00:27:31,338 --> 00:27:33,255
So you just broke into my goddamn house

463
00:27:33,256 --> 00:27:34,507
in the middle of the night?

464
00:27:34,508 --> 00:27:36,050
All right.

465
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:38,302
I'm trying to find a way
to do the job on the cunt,

466
00:27:38,303 --> 00:27:40,221
and if it's anywhere,
it'll be in Mallory's files.

467
00:27:40,222 --> 00:27:42,515
- Now would you like me to keep talking?
- No.

468
00:27:42,516 --> 00:27:46,685
No. Christ. Just don't
fucking say another word.

469
00:27:46,686 --> 00:27:49,230
The Mallory files are dead and buried.

470
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:51,774
You're the deputy
director of CIA Operations.

471
00:27:51,775 --> 00:27:53,609
- Dig 'em up.
- No.

472
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,861
- Why not?
- Because of you.

473
00:27:55,862 --> 00:27:57,613
- Me?
- Yes, you.

474
00:27:57,614 --> 00:27:59,448
The director will shitcan anyone

475
00:27:59,449 --> 00:28:01,075
who even goes near those files.

476
00:28:01,076 --> 00:28:05,162
You made it suicide
to go after the Supes.

477
00:28:05,163 --> 00:28:08,791
What are you even doing
back involved in this?

478
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:10,709
I mean, you have a death wish,

479
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,504
or are you a glutton for punishment?

480
00:28:13,505 --> 00:28:16,925
Yeah. A bit of both, I suppose.

481
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,975
Come on... Susan.

482
00:28:25,976 --> 00:28:29,019
Five minutes alone
with a piece of paper.

483
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,773
For old time's sakes. No one will know.

484
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:35,776
You-You're really
trying to sell this shit?

485
00:28:35,777 --> 00:28:38,612
- Why, you buying it?
- You think I look back fondly

486
00:28:38,613 --> 00:28:42,157
at the times we fucked in bar bathrooms?

487
00:28:42,158 --> 00:28:44,243
Oh, come on. We had a few laughs.

488
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:47,329
Like the time you sent
me the Edible Arrangement.

489
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,957
And what we had was
you trying to use me,

490
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:52,918
for a Get Out of Jail Free
card at a time like this.

491
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,546
Well, if that's all it was, then,

492
00:28:55,547 --> 00:28:57,548
what's got you so hot and bothered

493
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:00,635
when a simple "fuck you" would suffice?

494
00:29:01,887 --> 00:29:03,638
Fuck you.

495
00:29:05,515 --> 00:29:07,726
Now get out of my house.

496
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:21,155
Did I mention this is life or death?

497
00:29:21,156 --> 00:29:24,159
I'll send an Edible
Arrangement to your funeral.

498
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,182
Hi.

499
00:29:48,183 --> 00:29:51,353
I, um... I thought you
might be thirsty, so...

500
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:05,616
Well, if you don't
want it, I can always...

501
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:06,826
No, I want it.

502
00:30:12,248 --> 00:30:16,210
Cheers.

503
00:30:19,214 --> 00:30:20,631
So, listen, um,

504
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:25,052
I need to ask you some
questions about A-Train.

505
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:28,639
When he, uh, burst through that woman

506
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,810
the other day, Robin Ward.

507
00:30:32,811 --> 00:30:34,478
I-I need to know why.

508
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:36,522
Where was he going? What was he doing?

509
00:30:36,523 --> 00:30:38,941
Why? Was she your sister?

510
00:30:38,942 --> 00:30:41,610
Girlfriend?

511
00:30:41,611 --> 00:30:42,861
Girlfriend.

512
00:30:44,698 --> 00:30:47,032
That's what all this is about? Christ.

513
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:48,909
What makes you think I
know anything about it?

514
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,244
I know you and A-Train were tight.

515
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:51,453
You guys came up together.

516
00:30:51,454 --> 00:30:54,081
What are you, a fucking fan?

517
00:30:54,082 --> 00:30:58,419
Listen, those two guys in there,
they want to kill you, okay?

518
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,295
So you give me something, maybe I can...

519
00:31:00,296 --> 00:31:02,756
What? Hold 'em off? 'Cause they hang

520
00:31:02,757 --> 00:31:04,967
on your every word. You're
the big man around here.

521
00:31:04,968 --> 00:31:07,177
Okay, you don't want to
talk, don't talk. I tried.

522
00:31:07,178 --> 00:31:08,387
Good luck.

523
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:12,057
Buddy, my superpower ain't invisibility.

524
00:31:12,058 --> 00:31:13,476
You know that, right?

525
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:18,439
It's reading people.

526
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,275
Watching them when they
think they're alone.

527
00:31:32,746 --> 00:31:34,496
I see people for who they really are.

528
00:31:34,497 --> 00:31:36,999
I see you, too, pal.

529
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,250
Right.

530
00:31:38,251 --> 00:31:40,335
'Cause you know me so well, right?

531
00:31:40,336 --> 00:31:41,795
Yeah. I know you're
trying your damnedest

532
00:31:41,796 --> 00:31:44,923
to be tough... it's a little adorable...

533
00:31:44,924 --> 00:31:49,470
but the truth is... you're terrified.

534
00:31:49,471 --> 00:31:52,473
Shitting in your tighty-whities

535
00:31:52,474 --> 00:31:56,686
'cause you're "in over your
head fucked", and you know it.

536
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:20,709
Hughie,

537
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,921
I even kind of feel for you.

538
00:32:23,922 --> 00:32:28,217
Your girl died, and we do crazy
shit when we got broken hearts,

539
00:32:28,218 --> 00:32:30,636
but now every instinct
is screaming at you

540
00:32:30,637 --> 00:32:33,515
to head for the hills, and you
should listen to that instinct.

541
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:37,643
Unless we kill you first.

542
00:32:37,644 --> 00:32:40,062
How?

543
00:32:40,063 --> 00:32:42,064
I got invulnerable skin.

544
00:32:42,065 --> 00:32:46,068
I'm a fucking superhero, guy.

545
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:49,404
We fight gangs and terrorists.

546
00:32:49,405 --> 00:32:52,908
We save the world daily.

547
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:56,411
I've stood in front of
thousands of screaming fans,

548
00:32:56,412 --> 00:32:59,456
all of 'em creaming their jeans.

549
00:32:59,457 --> 00:33:00,958
Uh...

550
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,376
Who are you?

551
00:33:02,377 --> 00:33:06,880
A water balloon filled

552
00:33:06,881 --> 00:33:11,844
With blood and meat.

553
00:33:11,845 --> 00:33:15,055
Homelander's gonna find
me, and when he does,

554
00:33:15,056 --> 00:33:16,682
he's gonna burst you wide open.

555
00:33:16,683 --> 00:33:18,559
I'm gonna make it home
in time for cocktails.

556
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,645
'Cause that's who you
are, and that's who I am.

557
00:33:21,646 --> 00:33:26,066
You're not the hero of this story.

558
00:33:26,067 --> 00:33:29,862
And I'm not the one

559
00:33:29,863 --> 00:33:31,865
who's trapped.

560
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:39,538
Well, good luck.

561
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,541
I tried.

562
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:44,627
Great chat.

563
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:48,298
Run for the hills, Hughie.

564
00:33:55,388 --> 00:33:56,638
It looks like we're losing him.

565
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:58,933
The signal's going in and out.

566
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,771
Keep searching,

567
00:34:04,772 --> 00:34:06,774
another 50 feet down on the right.

568
00:34:41,184 --> 00:34:43,518
Because, thanks to Samaritan's Embrace,

569
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:45,020
Asim has a bed,

570
00:34:45,021 --> 00:34:47,898
a ventilated cooking area, and a laptop.

571
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:50,734
But our work is not done.
There are millions more children

572
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:53,403
just like Asim, who need your help.

573
00:34:53,404 --> 00:34:55,572
For just $9.99 a month. That is only...

574
00:34:55,573 --> 00:34:58,576
Hi, John. Thanks for your support.

575
00:35:00,578 --> 00:35:02,871
It's what makes this republic so great.

576
00:35:02,872 --> 00:35:05,374
Bill. How are the kids?

577
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:07,042
Hey.

578
00:35:07,043 --> 00:35:09,544
Give to Samaritan's Embrace today,

579
00:35:09,545 --> 00:35:11,380
and give a child just like Asim...

580
00:35:11,381 --> 00:35:12,923
Could I get a club soda?

581
00:35:12,924 --> 00:35:14,633
Ms. Stillwell.

582
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:17,886
Senator, what can I get you?

583
00:35:17,887 --> 00:35:21,390
- Jack, rocks.
- You know, we have Macallan 25.

584
00:35:21,391 --> 00:35:24,017
You'd be wasting it.
Whiskey's whiskey to me.

585
00:35:25,895 --> 00:35:28,563
Boy, they're blowing so
much smoke up Maeve's ass,

586
00:35:28,564 --> 00:35:32,150
it's a miracle she
doesn't die of lung cancer.

587
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:36,405
But you know it's just
that, right? Smoke.

588
00:35:36,406 --> 00:35:38,532
- I'm sorry?
- Everyone loves

589
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:42,494
to bask in their glow,
but tomorrow morning

590
00:35:42,495 --> 00:35:45,914
no one's putting Supes
into national defense.

591
00:35:45,915 --> 00:35:48,834
It won't get out of committee,
much less hit the floor.

592
00:35:48,835 --> 00:35:50,627
Because God forbid we
could have an advantage

593
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:52,004
in an armed conflict.

594
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:54,798
You send a Supe over the 38th parallel,

595
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:56,508
Pyongyang's gonna answer with a nuke.

596
00:35:56,509 --> 00:35:58,344
Then one of my guys will catch it.

597
00:35:59,704 --> 00:36:01,972
You see Robertson over there?

598
00:36:01,973 --> 00:36:05,267
He's got Lockheed in his
state and in his pocket.

599
00:36:05,268 --> 00:36:09,202
McCrea? He's got Fort Bragg
and its couple thousand voters.

600
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:14,318
No one wants to outsource to you.

601
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:16,570
America runs on weapons.

602
00:36:16,571 --> 00:36:18,989
Hell, it's one of the only
damn things we still make.

603
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:22,200
But you are the chairman.
Where do you stand?

604
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:24,077
Me? I'm just an old leatherneck.

605
00:36:24,078 --> 00:36:25,746
And if I was on the line,

606
00:36:25,747 --> 00:36:28,292
scare the shit out of me
to have Homelander there.

607
00:36:28,293 --> 00:36:31,519
My heroes are the most
loyal, patriotic...

608
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,753
That's just it.

609
00:36:32,754 --> 00:36:36,800
They're your heroes, aren't they?

610
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:42,471
Get him a Macallan 25.

611
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:49,561
Why have average when you
can have extraordinary?

612
00:36:56,277 --> 00:36:58,028
Thank you.

613
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,365
Guys, we should get back to the party.

614
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:03,116
- What?
- Elena just ordered more booze.

615
00:37:03,117 --> 00:37:04,409
- Come on, let's go back.
- No, no...

616
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,494
It'll be more fun at the party.

617
00:37:05,495 --> 00:37:06,703
Please... okay, don't touch me.

618
00:37:06,704 --> 00:37:08,538
No, please, please.

619
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:11,041
Oh, no, no! Stop! No, no, no, no!

620
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:12,167
Please, no, no, no, no!

621
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:14,586
- The girl said no.
- Help.

622
00:37:14,587 --> 00:37:16,254
We're all friends here.

623
00:37:16,255 --> 00:37:18,633
Yeah, it's all good. It's fine.

624
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:30,228
Miss, do me a favor and shut your eyes.

625
00:37:31,854 --> 00:37:33,772
Fucking bitch.

626
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:54,543
Fucking diamond skin.

627
00:37:56,254 --> 00:37:57,755
- Fuck.
- Merde!

628
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,055
Here.

629
00:38:07,098 --> 00:38:09,057
Here, take it.

630
00:38:09,058 --> 00:38:11,560
What is that?

631
00:38:11,561 --> 00:38:13,812
It will help with your, uh, anxiety.

632
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:16,773
It's LSD and MDMA. This is a candy flip.

633
00:38:16,774 --> 00:38:18,233
It'll smooth you right out. Take it.

634
00:38:18,234 --> 00:38:20,527
Uh, thank you, but I-I
don't think now is the time

635
00:38:20,528 --> 00:38:23,321
for a major hallucinogen.

636
00:38:23,322 --> 00:38:26,325
Fais-toi plaisir.

637
00:38:35,751 --> 00:38:38,170
What are you exactly?

638
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:41,840
Chemist? Engineer? What?

639
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:45,969
No. I know a little
about a lot of things.

640
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:49,764
I'm a gunrunner by trade,
but, uh, as you can see,

641
00:38:49,765 --> 00:38:51,600
I've developed a certain niche.

642
00:38:51,601 --> 00:38:53,185
Killing superheroes?

643
00:38:53,186 --> 00:38:55,520
No.

644
00:38:55,521 --> 00:38:58,648
You can count on one hand the
number of dead superheroes.

645
00:38:58,649 --> 00:39:01,652
Sometimes you can,
uh, incapacitate them.

646
00:39:04,489 --> 00:39:07,824
Truly, they are magnificent creatures.

647
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:10,160
Mm.

648
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:13,246
Each one with a unique power
that requires a unique solution.

649
00:39:13,247 --> 00:39:16,917
It's, uh... it's never the same twice.

650
00:39:16,918 --> 00:39:18,668
Who pays you to do that?

651
00:39:18,669 --> 00:39:20,963
Whoever can pay.

652
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:26,593
And when you do kill a Supe...

653
00:39:26,594 --> 00:39:28,929
or, you know, any-anyone...

654
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:32,767
um... what's it like?

655
00:39:39,398 --> 00:39:42,609
You know...

656
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:45,695
I saw this woman once,
in a midtown elevator,

657
00:39:45,696 --> 00:39:48,657
2008.

658
00:39:48,658 --> 00:39:51,368
No more for ten seconds, I see her, huh?

659
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:53,411
Stunning.

660
00:39:53,412 --> 00:39:55,039
Five-nine.

661
00:39:56,582 --> 00:39:59,751
Hair so black it absorbed
the light, you know?

662
00:39:59,752 --> 00:40:03,338
Tom Ford pencil skirt,
Louboutin stilettos.

663
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:04,923
C'est magnifique.

664
00:40:04,924 --> 00:40:07,300
But she had,

665
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:09,928
uh... she had...

666
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:12,931
I never forget this, you see...

667
00:40:12,932 --> 00:40:15,767
she had dirt under her fingernails

668
00:40:15,768 --> 00:40:18,770
and callouses on her hands,
and I see this and I say, "Oh,

669
00:40:18,771 --> 00:40:21,314
strange for such a
refined woman like this."

670
00:40:21,315 --> 00:40:22,566
What, you...

671
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:23,608
You a gardener?

672
00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:24,693
You know, are you a sculptor?

673
00:40:24,694 --> 00:40:26,611
What is this, huh?

674
00:40:26,612 --> 00:40:30,283
And I think about this...

675
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:36,080
I think about her all the time.

676
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:40,585
She was the first person I ever killed.

677
00:40:45,464 --> 00:40:46,673
I carry...

678
00:40:46,674 --> 00:40:49,968
I carry them all with me.

679
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:53,848
It's like scars in a way, you know?

680
00:40:59,269 --> 00:41:02,088
Okay, Senator, you ready?

681
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:05,442
Oh, yeah.

682
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:09,321
Oh. Oh, darling.

683
00:41:09,322 --> 00:41:11,615
- Mm-hmm?
- You know I like to watch.

684
00:41:11,616 --> 00:41:14,242
No. Can't always be in control.

685
00:41:14,243 --> 00:41:17,037
Sir.

686
00:41:17,038 --> 00:41:19,998
Then I guess I'll just have
to feel my way through it.

687
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:23,002
Oh, you'll feel good indeed, baby.

688
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:31,217
- You ready?
- Oh, I was born ready.

689
00:41:31,218 --> 00:41:34,679
- Mm-hmm.
- Feels like butter, baby.

690
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,097
Get ready, sir.

691
00:41:36,098 --> 00:41:38,183
You're going in.

692
00:41:38,184 --> 00:41:39,684
Yee-haw!

693
00:41:39,685 --> 00:41:41,311
Giddyup, gal. Come on.

694
00:41:41,312 --> 00:41:42,437
Oh, God.

695
00:41:42,438 --> 00:41:45,023
That-that feels different.

696
00:41:58,204 --> 00:42:00,455
Hey...

697
00:42:00,456 --> 00:42:02,332
Homelander.

698
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,751
Starlight.

699
00:42:04,752 --> 00:42:06,754
How are you?

700
00:42:08,547 --> 00:42:11,549
Uh, I'm good.

701
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,135
Good.

702
00:42:14,136 --> 00:42:17,972
Hey, is that your, uh, secret identity?

703
00:42:17,973 --> 00:42:20,850
- Mm-hmm.
- Charming.

704
00:42:20,851 --> 00:42:22,060
Thanks.

705
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:25,397
Yeah, I-I gave up on mine...

706
00:42:25,398 --> 00:42:29,110
oh... a long time ago now.

707
00:42:30,152 --> 00:42:32,278
I think I'm gonna go to sleep.

708
00:42:34,031 --> 00:42:36,033
Good night.

709
00:42:45,751 --> 00:42:48,878
No. No, I did not

710
00:42:48,879 --> 00:42:51,673
go through eight rounds of IVF

711
00:42:51,674 --> 00:42:54,426
and bleeding nipples to quit now.

712
00:42:54,427 --> 00:42:57,554
I am doing this. Yes.

713
00:42:57,555 --> 00:43:00,181
That little kid is gonna
drink my goddamn milk

714
00:43:00,182 --> 00:43:01,975
if it's the last thing I do.

715
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,043
While scientists
now believe the shell evolved

716
00:43:29,044 --> 00:43:32,423
to help turtles burrow underground...

717
00:43:47,104 --> 00:43:48,229
What are you doing?

718
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,440
Shocking our invisible friend.

719
00:43:50,441 --> 00:43:52,942
I need him unconscious.

720
00:43:52,943 --> 00:43:54,361
Why?

721
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,656
Because I got it.

722
00:43:59,116 --> 00:44:00,909
Now what the fuck do you want?

723
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,248
What the fuck, Starlight?!

724
00:44:07,249 --> 00:44:08,958
What?

725
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,424
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

726
00:44:16,425 --> 00:44:17,842
Oh, shit.

727
00:44:17,843 --> 00:44:19,719
And so glad you did it in plain clothes,

728
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,763
so you could blow your secret identity.

729
00:44:21,764 --> 00:44:26,267
Here: "OMG. I recognize
Starlight, that's Annie January!

730
00:44:26,268 --> 00:44:27,894
I went to Hoover High with her.

731
00:44:27,895 --> 00:44:30,647
#SheWasBulimic."

732
00:44:33,234 --> 00:44:35,860
One, this was stupid.

733
00:44:35,861 --> 00:44:40,114
Two, it was really
stupid to do it on camera.

734
00:44:40,115 --> 00:44:41,866
Always look for cameras.

735
00:44:41,867 --> 00:44:44,244
- They were about to rape a girl.
- What girl?

736
00:44:44,245 --> 00:44:46,162
There's no girl in that
video. You get a name?

737
00:44:46,163 --> 00:44:47,330
No, she ran off.

738
00:44:47,331 --> 00:44:49,123
Oh, great. She ran off. Great.

739
00:44:49,124 --> 00:44:51,709
Always get a fucking
name, Starlight. Always!

740
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,461
Well, uh... They-they said... Hmm.

741
00:44:53,462 --> 00:44:56,297
They-they said she was a friend.

742
00:44:56,298 --> 00:44:57,715
It was date rape, I think.

743
00:44:57,716 --> 00:44:59,759
Great. Well, she hasn't come forward

744
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,594
and, statistically, she's not likely to.

745
00:45:01,595 --> 00:45:04,097
So all we really have is two Delta Betas

746
00:45:04,098 --> 00:45:06,182
who insist they were just
getting drunk in an alley

747
00:45:06,183 --> 00:45:09,102
until you beat them unconscious.

748
00:45:09,103 --> 00:45:10,895
They're lying! I, uh...

749
00:45:10,896 --> 00:45:13,648
Aren't I innocent until proven guilty?

750
00:45:13,649 --> 00:45:16,485
When you're in the big
leagues? You flip it.

751
00:45:20,114 --> 00:45:21,823
I don't know what you were
planning on doing today, hmm,

752
00:45:21,824 --> 00:45:23,950
with your little... cute day,

753
00:45:23,951 --> 00:45:25,785
but you have to cancel everything, okay?

754
00:45:25,786 --> 00:45:27,287
You're gonna have meetings
with Risk Assessment,

755
00:45:27,288 --> 00:45:29,581
with Crisis Management, with Legal.

756
00:45:29,582 --> 00:45:32,500
Jerry is gonna lose his shit!

757
00:45:32,501 --> 00:45:34,210
Fuck.

758
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:36,212
Am...

759
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,424
Are they gonna fire me?

760
00:45:39,425 --> 00:45:42,760
Just be in Stillwell's office at 10:00.

761
00:45:42,761 --> 00:45:44,470
What?

762
00:45:44,471 --> 00:45:46,556
Am I fired?

763
00:45:46,557 --> 00:45:49,809
Senator, I very much appreciate
you coming bright and early.

764
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:53,939
I realize, uh, how busy
you were last night.

765
00:46:02,072 --> 00:46:04,198
These... are fake.

766
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:05,951
I think we both know they're not.

767
00:46:07,995 --> 00:46:11,164
Look. I was with a
young woman, all right?

768
00:46:11,165 --> 00:46:12,707
Of legal age.

769
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:14,083
Her name was Rhonda.

770
00:46:14,084 --> 00:46:16,628
So this isn't possible.

771
00:46:16,629 --> 00:46:19,088
They've... obviously
been doctored or something.

772
00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:20,840
I'm sorry, they are authentic.

773
00:46:20,841 --> 00:46:23,176
I should know. I was there.

774
00:46:23,177 --> 00:46:24,929
You what?

775
00:46:32,227 --> 00:46:34,228
You shiver when you orgasm, sir.

776
00:46:34,229 --> 00:46:35,897
Oh, Jesus.

777
00:46:37,316 --> 00:46:40,109
That will be all, Doppelganger.

778
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:42,153
Who the fuck is he?

779
00:46:42,154 --> 00:46:44,113
Anyway, I would love to continue

780
00:46:44,114 --> 00:46:47,158
our conversation from last night.

781
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:50,328
This is some dirty
fucking pool, Madelyn.

782
00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:53,039
You're really gonna clutch
your pearls, Senator?

783
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,918
I don't think either
one of us is that naive.

784
00:46:56,919 --> 00:46:59,295
Yeah. It's not...

785
00:46:59,296 --> 00:47:02,423
it's not fatal to be...
homosexual these days.

786
00:47:02,424 --> 00:47:04,509
It is in Oklahoma, sir.

787
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:06,512
Where your voters live.

788
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:10,890
Even if I get the bill out of committee,

789
00:47:10,891 --> 00:47:13,559
nobody's gonna vote for it on the floor.

790
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,563
No one wants your
fucking Supes in the Army.

791
00:47:18,065 --> 00:47:19,608
We'll see.

792
00:47:23,112 --> 00:47:25,113
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

793
00:47:29,702 --> 00:47:31,995
Homelander.

794
00:47:31,996 --> 00:47:35,081
Uh... wel-welcome to Crime Analytics.

795
00:47:35,082 --> 00:47:36,708
Can... Would you like a Red Bull?

796
00:47:36,709 --> 00:47:38,209
Have you found Translucent yet?

797
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:40,753
Oh. Uh, no. But Security's on it.

798
00:47:40,754 --> 00:47:44,799
He's been missing over 24 hours.

799
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,260
- Is he in danger?
- Um...

800
00:47:47,261 --> 00:47:49,263
Do... you even know?

801
00:47:51,515 --> 00:47:52,890
Forget it. I'll find him myself.

802
00:47:52,891 --> 00:47:54,308
What's his last known position, please?

803
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:56,436
Why don't I just call Ms. Stillwell?

804
00:47:56,437 --> 00:47:58,021
- And I...
- No.

805
00:47:58,022 --> 00:47:59,313
No, no, no, no, no.

806
00:47:59,314 --> 00:48:00,606
You're talking to me.

807
00:48:00,607 --> 00:48:03,443
Well, I'm not sure

808
00:48:03,444 --> 00:48:05,278
I'm supposed to be talking to...

809
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:07,613
What's your name?

810
00:48:07,614 --> 00:48:08,823
- Anika.
- Anika.

811
00:48:08,824 --> 00:48:09,949
Sir.

812
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:11,159
It's a beautiful name.

813
00:48:12,202 --> 00:48:14,203
Listen, Anika.

814
00:48:14,204 --> 00:48:16,330
- I'm the Homelander.
- Mm-hmm.

815
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:19,250
And I can do whatever the fuck I want.

816
00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:21,502
Okay?

817
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,254
Now...

818
00:48:23,255 --> 00:48:26,884
Translucent's last known position.

819
00:48:28,302 --> 00:48:30,304
Please.

820
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:40,437
What the... ?

821
00:48:40,438 --> 00:48:41,522
Something doesn't feel right.

822
00:48:41,523 --> 00:48:42,857
Oh, I'll bet.

823
00:48:42,858 --> 00:48:44,442
I'm not ashamed to admit

824
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:46,445
I have outdone myself.

825
00:48:50,532 --> 00:48:52,450
Now, the problem is the skin, no?

826
00:48:52,451 --> 00:48:54,535
It's, uh, hard like diamonds.

827
00:48:54,536 --> 00:48:57,830
But then I realized, it is just
your shell that is hard, huh?

828
00:48:57,831 --> 00:49:00,333
Like a turtle.

829
00:49:00,334 --> 00:49:02,168
But your insides...

830
00:49:02,169 --> 00:49:04,587
they're like the rest of ours...

831
00:49:04,588 --> 00:49:06,005
soft.

832
00:49:06,006 --> 00:49:09,258
So, how do you get to
the... squishy insides?

833
00:49:09,259 --> 00:49:10,510
Through the mouth? Non.

834
00:49:10,511 --> 00:49:13,346
The stomach acid, the gag reflex.

835
00:49:13,347 --> 00:49:17,892
If I stick something down your
throat, you may vomit it up.

836
00:49:19,686 --> 00:49:21,104
There's truly only one way...

837
00:49:21,105 --> 00:49:23,439
The fuck did you do to me?

838
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,235
He stuck a lump of
plastique up your bum, son.

839
00:49:27,236 --> 00:49:29,571
Ass bomb.

840
00:49:31,073 --> 00:49:33,075
Oh, my God.

841
00:49:36,411 --> 00:49:38,204
Now...

842
00:49:38,205 --> 00:49:41,999
you stick a little finger up
there and try and fish it out...

843
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,377
bang.

844
00:49:44,378 --> 00:49:47,755
I trigger this... also bang.

845
00:49:47,756 --> 00:49:49,173
Savvy?

846
00:49:49,174 --> 00:49:52,135
Oh, please don't kill me.

847
00:49:52,136 --> 00:49:53,803
I'll do anything.

848
00:49:53,804 --> 00:49:57,557
I'll tell you about A-Train.

849
00:49:57,558 --> 00:49:59,225
That's what the kid wants, right?

850
00:49:59,226 --> 00:50:01,769
I-I-I-I don't know
where A-Train was going

851
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:03,146
that night he killed the girl,

852
00:50:03,147 --> 00:50:05,022
okay, but I know where
he was coming from.

853
00:50:05,023 --> 00:50:06,190
What? Where?

854
00:50:06,191 --> 00:50:07,859
Popclaw's.

855
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,319
He fucking... loves her.

856
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,071
He doesn't think anyone
else knows, but I know.

857
00:50:12,072 --> 00:50:13,281
I know a lot of things.

858
00:50:13,282 --> 00:50:14,866
But he-he's there every night.

859
00:50:14,867 --> 00:50:17,201
Maybe... now, even.

860
00:50:17,202 --> 00:50:18,494
Popclaw? That's the hero with the...

861
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,454
the sharp things coming out of her arms.

862
00:50:20,455 --> 00:50:21,998
Yeah. Real D-lister.

863
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:24,083
Anyone knows what A-Train
was doing, it's Popclaw.

864
00:50:24,084 --> 00:50:26,502
But that's all I know about
that, I swear to Christ.

865
00:50:26,503 --> 00:50:28,796
But I'll tell you
anything else you want.

866
00:50:28,797 --> 00:50:30,841
Just ask.

867
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:37,388
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

868
00:50:37,389 --> 00:50:40,391
Just... ask anything.

869
00:50:40,392 --> 00:50:44,520
Now, normally, that would be
just what the doctor ordered.

870
00:50:44,521 --> 00:50:47,773
But unfortunately... for you...

871
00:50:47,774 --> 00:50:49,650
we're out of time.

872
00:50:49,651 --> 00:50:51,444
No.

873
00:50:51,445 --> 00:50:52,653
No!

874
00:50:52,654 --> 00:50:54,864
Please! Listen, I know shit.

875
00:50:54,865 --> 00:50:56,991
Dark shit! All the way to the top!

876
00:50:56,992 --> 00:50:59,076
Wait, wait! No, no, no, no,
no! Please, wait, wait, wait.

877
00:50:59,077 --> 00:51:01,078
Listen, I can help you.
I'm fucking invisible!

878
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:02,580
- We can be a team.
- Butcher!

879
00:51:02,581 --> 00:51:03,998
No, please, please,
please! Please, I can...

880
00:51:03,999 --> 00:51:05,750
A moment, s'il vous plait.

881
00:51:10,047 --> 00:51:11,048
Here.

882
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:13,550
What is that?

883
00:51:15,302 --> 00:51:16,761
Homelander.

884
00:51:16,762 --> 00:51:19,055
That's Homelander?

885
00:51:19,056 --> 00:51:21,140
Homelander's here? Oh, shit.

886
00:51:21,141 --> 00:51:22,892
Oh, shit!

887
00:51:24,394 --> 00:51:26,312
He could see us.

888
00:51:26,313 --> 00:51:28,564
He's got X-ray vision. He can
see through the fucking roof.

889
00:51:28,565 --> 00:51:30,608
And super fucking hearing.

890
00:51:30,609 --> 00:51:33,403
You pull that detonator, he will hear.

891
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:42,370
Homelander.

892
00:51:42,371 --> 00:51:44,647
We got to throw him off the scent.

893
00:51:44,648 --> 00:51:45,782
But how?

894
00:51:45,783 --> 00:51:48,042
Pittsburgh.

895
00:51:48,043 --> 00:51:49,919
Oh, you cannot be serious, huh?

896
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,963
Deadly.

897
00:51:51,964 --> 00:51:54,423
You know how much this will cost me?

898
00:51:54,424 --> 00:51:56,009
Put it on the tab.

899
00:52:04,577 --> 00:52:06,436
Guys?!

900
00:52:13,568 --> 00:52:15,611
Where is it?

901
00:52:15,612 --> 00:52:17,531
Back door panel.

902
00:52:25,914 --> 00:52:27,915
Look, the mall shooting's a tragedy.

903
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:29,625
I'm just saying, if
more people were armed,

904
00:52:29,626 --> 00:52:32,169
maybe I wouldn't have to
save the day every time.

905
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:33,546
- So, in a situation...
- Hello?

906
00:52:33,547 --> 00:52:35,548
Cherie. It's a burn.

907
00:52:35,549 --> 00:52:37,199
You're joking.

908
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,343
Now?

909
00:52:38,344 --> 00:52:39,635
No joke, I'm afraid.

910
00:52:42,431 --> 00:52:44,724
Fine.

911
00:52:44,725 --> 00:52:47,394
I'll be ready in three.

912
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:51,230
Come on.

913
00:52:51,231 --> 00:52:52,773
Frenchie, I'm getting
shit reception here.

914
00:52:52,774 --> 00:52:54,134
Well, figure it the fuck out, huh?

915
00:52:57,612 --> 00:52:59,573
Come on.

916
00:53:30,645 --> 00:53:32,647
Evening.

917
00:53:34,149 --> 00:53:35,775
Holy shit.

918
00:53:35,776 --> 00:53:37,151
You're the Homelander.

919
00:53:37,152 --> 00:53:38,361
I am talking to the Homelander.

920
00:53:38,362 --> 00:53:39,445
Mm-hmm.

921
00:53:39,446 --> 00:53:41,281
Sir, I need to see some ID.

922
00:53:43,533 --> 00:53:45,284
Get the fuck back in that cage.

923
00:53:45,285 --> 00:53:47,620
Just take it easy. Okay?

924
00:53:47,621 --> 00:53:49,246
You doing out here?

925
00:53:49,247 --> 00:53:51,207
This is my place.

926
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:54,294
We... I'm, uh... I'm
opening a Fogo de Chao.

927
00:53:54,295 --> 00:53:56,629
You know what a churrascaria is?

928
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:58,547
Yeah. It's a Brazilian steakhouse.

929
00:53:58,548 --> 00:54:01,842
Sir, I need to see in
the back of the van.

930
00:54:01,843 --> 00:54:04,388
No offense, you got a...
warrant or something?

931
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:08,349
Well, if you got nothing back there,

932
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:10,030
then you got nothing
to worry about, right?

933
00:54:15,565 --> 00:54:17,317
Please get back in the cage.

934
00:54:18,402 --> 00:54:20,361
I'm not getting back in that cage, man.

935
00:54:20,362 --> 00:54:22,113
I do, I am dead.

936
00:54:22,114 --> 00:54:25,449
Yeah, well, if you don't... you're dead.

937
00:54:50,434 --> 00:54:51,684
Just think.

938
00:54:51,685 --> 00:54:53,310
You kill me,

939
00:54:53,311 --> 00:54:57,189
they'll never stop looking for you.

940
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:00,776
You'll be glancing over
your shoulder your whole life

941
00:55:00,777 --> 00:55:03,196
till they find you, which they will.

942
00:55:16,877 --> 00:55:18,317
Everything all right, sir?

943
00:55:39,357 --> 00:55:42,443
Look, you let me go...

944
00:55:42,444 --> 00:55:46,864
you'll be the hero
that saved Translucent.

945
00:55:46,865 --> 00:55:49,283
It's not too late.

946
00:55:49,284 --> 00:55:52,077
You can still go home.

947
00:55:52,078 --> 00:55:55,207
Back to your life.

948
00:56:00,754 --> 00:56:02,756
Attaboy.
