1
00:00:01,238 --> 00:00:04,473
Key of A, watch me for the
changes and try to keep up.

2
00:00:04,475 --> 00:00:06,442
Gideon and I have calculated
another Aberration

3
00:00:06,444 --> 00:00:10,579
- in Bhopal, 1912.
- Why can't it be Aruba, 2016?

4
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:15,884
We are history's last line of defense.

5
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:16,986
I like the sound of that.

6
00:00:20,758 --> 00:00:23,959
Have you gentlemen heard
of the Spear of Destiny?

7
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:26,028
The Spear could alter reality itself.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,298
Changes to history cause
timequakes and Aberrations,

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,866
which we can undo.

10
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:33,002
Changes to reality, those are permanent.

11
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:34,803
You're on the run
'cause you're a time remnant.

12
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:36,171
Now something's chasing you,

13
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:37,906
trying to correct the Aberration.

14
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:39,675
One of history's worst monsters.

15
00:00:39,677 --> 00:00:41,477
The Legion have

16
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:44,279
the Spear of Destiny and
they're like gods now.

17
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:45,881
It appears that after
the Legion got the Spear

18
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:48,851
and change reality, they
kept us around as their pets.

19
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,258
You'll be forced to live your lives

20
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,293
in a reality that I created.

21
00:00:58,295 --> 00:01:02,097
We go back in time to 1916

22
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:03,866
and we stop the Legion from ever getting

23
00:01:03,868 --> 00:01:05,534
the Spear of Destiny in the first place.

24
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:11,540
All right, Gideon, try it now.

25
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:13,342
All systems nominal, Captain.

26
00:01:13,344 --> 00:01:15,944
That's more like it.

27
00:01:15,946 --> 00:01:18,380
Any luck in contacting
the rest of the team?

28
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:20,249
Negative, but it stands to reason

29
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:21,984
that they would be facing
challenges of their own

30
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:24,086
- in this altered reality.
- Indeed.

31
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:26,789
Which is why it falls
to us to rescue them.

32
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,590
Engines to full power.

33
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:33,996
Can you pinpoint our location, Gideon?

34
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:37,132
- Central City, 2017.
- That's odd.

35
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:38,834
We must be in some sort of hangar.

36
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:41,270
One large enough to
accommodate the Waverider.

37
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,045
Gideon, what is that?

38
00:01:50,047 --> 00:01:52,264
- Is that another ship?
- Negative.

39
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:57,853
It appears to be a desk lamp.

40
00:01:57,855 --> 00:02:00,222
Oh, bollocks.

41
00:02:00,224 --> 00:02:03,459
Right. Engage our
cloak and plot a course.

42
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:06,361
- Heading, Captain?
- The nearest open window.

43
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,536
Any luck?

44
00:02:14,538 --> 00:02:15,938
You asked me that five minutes ago.

45
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,206
You know, it's not easy trying to get

46
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,408
a 21st century radio to communicate with

47
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,410
a 22nd century time ship.

48
00:02:21,412 --> 00:02:23,512
Thawne never told you
what he did with Rip?

49
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:26,982
No, we weren't close like that.

50
00:02:26,984 --> 00:02:28,917
How you holding up?

51
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,586
Better than Amaya.

52
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:32,521
I never knew about you guys.

53
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:34,189
It's nothing to know.

54
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:38,026
We were just, you know, figuring it out.

55
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:39,728
I figured it out.

56
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,697
We've been assuming that
Waverider's broadcasting

57
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:44,133
- using a quantum frequency, but...
- But only if the quad band

58
00:02:44,135 --> 00:02:45,701
antenna array was in alignment.

59
00:02:45,703 --> 00:02:48,470
- Ray, you are a genius.
- I guess I am.

60
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:49,905
I kinda forgot what it was like.

61
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:52,474
So can you communicate with Rip or what?

62
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:54,743
Sara? Sara, is that you?

63
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:57,479
Good job, guys. Good job.

64
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:59,381
We didn't do anything yet.

65
00:02:59,383 --> 00:03:01,750
- Rip?
- Yes, Dr. Palmer,

66
00:03:01,752 --> 00:03:03,752
I've honed in on your location.

67
00:03:03,754 --> 00:03:06,054
Well haul ass over here
and come pick us up.

68
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:09,958
There may be one small
problem with that.

69
00:03:22,273 --> 00:03:25,941
Look, it's the teeny, weenie Englishman.

70
00:03:25,943 --> 00:03:28,810
Mr. Rory, will you please stop?

71
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:30,846
Ah, relax.

72
00:03:34,952 --> 00:03:38,754
Why would Thawne use the
Spear of Destiny to shrink you?

73
00:03:38,756 --> 00:03:40,422
Uh, I don't believe he did.

74
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:43,792
I'm assuming that he
used Dr. Palmer's exosuit.

75
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:47,196
Oh. Well then, he must
still have it in his lab.

76
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:49,593
We gotta steal it back and
then we can unshrink the ship.

77
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,600
- And then what?
- Rip, we have a plan

78
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:54,136
to put reality back as it was.

79
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:55,904
But you're not gonna like it.

80
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,217
Haircut, where to now?

81
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:09,851
Uh, I don't know.

82
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:11,787
I never exactly saw my exosuit here.

83
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:13,889
I just figured, where
else would Thawne hide it?

84
00:04:13,891 --> 00:04:15,657
All right, let's split up.

85
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,482
Psst, Ray!

86
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:24,166
Ah. Yes.

87
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:26,902
Oh, I have missed you.

88
00:04:26,904 --> 00:04:28,136
Really, dude?

89
00:04:28,138 --> 00:04:30,739
I will never, ever leave you again.

90
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:32,341
Rip, we found the suit.

91
00:04:32,343 --> 00:04:33,809
You need to close in on our position

92
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:36,078
before I have to watch
Ray do anymore weird stuff.

93
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,247
En route.

94
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:41,049
- Weird stuff?
- Yeah, you got issues, dude.

95
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:50,959
We got two more
rent-a-thugs down the hall.

96
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,194
I thought that Thawne
should've killed you morons

97
00:04:53,197 --> 00:04:56,198
at the reactor.

98
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,101
- Ah!
- Then I realized,

99
00:04:59,103 --> 00:05:04,139
now I get to kill the Legends myself.

100
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:11,679
Gideon, fire! Fire everything!

101
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:15,183
Aww, isn't that adorable?

102
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:17,219
- Is that the best you got?
- How about this?

103
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:24,159
Sara, reinforcements
will be on their way.

104
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:28,430
We're heading to you, Ray.

105
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:30,799
Let's blow the roof off this place.

106
00:05:30,801 --> 00:05:36,405
All right, Rip. Keep
the Waverider steady.

107
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:51,295
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

108
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,791
We have returned to
the Battle of the Somme

109
00:05:55,793 --> 00:05:57,893
- in the year 1916.
- And apparently,

110
00:05:57,895 --> 00:06:00,329
we're ready to destroy time
itself by interfering in events

111
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:02,064
that we've already participated in.

112
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:04,433
If that's what it takes
to save Amaya, count me in.

113
00:06:04,435 --> 00:06:05,901
Yeah, there's no way
I'm letting Grey go out

114
00:06:05,903 --> 00:06:07,269
as one of Thawne's lackeys.

115
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:09,304
We can't allow Doomworld to continue

116
00:06:09,306 --> 00:06:11,973
- no matter what the risk.
- Okay. Well, look,

117
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:13,575
like time, reality needs to set.

118
00:06:13,577 --> 00:06:16,078
Essentially, we're in a
race. Not against time,

119
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,014
but from a reality wave
initiating from 2017.

120
00:06:19,016 --> 00:06:20,382
All the more reason to get moving.

121
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:22,217
At the very least, we need to mitigate

122
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:25,187
the scope of the time
paradox by avoiding contact

123
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:28,623
with our former selves at all costs.

124
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,093
So all we have to do is
help us... I mean, them...

125
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:34,328
Destroy the Spear without them
knowing that we're helping.

126
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:35,964
- Kinda like Secret Santa.
- We already know

127
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:37,466
where the Blood of Christ is.

128
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:40,802
So me, you and Ray, we go
back to the Church of Amiens

129
00:06:40,804 --> 00:06:43,171
and we leave the Blood for
our former selves to find.

130
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:45,240
I got a question.

131
00:06:45,242 --> 00:06:49,277
What happens to us when our
former selves destroy the Spear?

132
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,947
Well, we cease to exist.

133
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,448
Because we never would have existed

134
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,584
if the Legion hadn't gotten the Spear.

135
00:06:55,586 --> 00:06:58,153
You're saying we're the Aberrations.

136
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:04,059
In order to save the world,

137
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:05,494
we have to erase ourselves.

138
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:08,730
Huh, listen. Why don't
we just go to Aruba,

139
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:11,466
get drunk... what?

140
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:14,870
Sunshine. Mai tais.

141
00:07:14,872 --> 00:07:18,006
Girls in... bikinis.

142
00:07:21,078 --> 00:07:24,379
- All right, Ray. You're up.
- I'm on it.

143
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:28,683
Pardon me.

144
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:30,419
Excuse me.

145
00:07:30,421 --> 00:07:32,403
Coming through.

146
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:34,189
Don't mind the tiny man flying through

147
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:36,691
the middle of no man's land!

148
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:39,394
I'm closing in on the
Blood's burial spot, Captain.

149
00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:44,266
I'm here.

150
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:06,555
Well, that was easier
the second time around.

151
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:14,863
I knew you idiots would
come back from 2017.

152
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:16,765
Apart from being incredibly stupid,

153
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,900
you are just so predictable.

154
00:08:18,902 --> 00:08:20,535
Give me back the vial.

155
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:26,374
What vial?

156
00:08:26,376 --> 00:08:29,244
Ray? Ray, get out of there!

157
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:32,280
You know, my allies
keep giving me the same,

158
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:34,516
simple piece of advice.

159
00:08:55,105 --> 00:08:57,372
They were right.

160
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,574
I should've done that ages ago.

161
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:02,511
Hey, what are you doing?

162
00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:03,655
You're gonna get yourself killed!

163
00:09:03,657 --> 00:09:05,370
- We have to get him...
- Sara, you can't!

164
00:09:05,373 --> 00:09:08,783
- Gideon...
- Sara! Sara.

165
00:09:08,785 --> 00:09:10,519
He's gone.

166
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,596
So what?

167
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,766
Haircut said it himself,
we're all Aberrations

168
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,267
living on borrowed time.

169
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,370
Besides, he's alive and well in 1916.

170
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,440
Mick's right. The
mission hasn't changed.

171
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:37,975
Except we can't destroy the Spear

172
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,576
because we don't have
the Blood of Christ.

173
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,979
So we steal the spear
and get it out of 1916.

174
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,747
Now, you do realize that
there's a big problem

175
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,048
with that plan, Sara.

176
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,284
The other us's have the Spear.

177
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:51,054
Oh, never stolen anything
from myself before.

178
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:52,038
Could be interesting.

179
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,824
Ugh, need I remind you

180
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,560
that we cannot interact with ourselves.

181
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,529
Which is why the three of you

182
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,764
are gonna sneak into the other Waverider

183
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,833
while the other you's are at the church.

184
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:06,103
Now that... That sounds like a plan.

185
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,472
I suggest you hurry. Events
are already in motion.

186
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,174
Mr. Rory's earlier self is currently

187
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,176
being contacted by Mr. Snart.

188
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,211
All right, if we're gonna
go impersonating ourselves...

189
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,381
- You're gonna need a haircut.
- Yeah.

190
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:21,084
Not for nothing, but Aruba
would've been a better option.

191
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,454
You're not real.

192
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:26,557
You're an illumination.

193
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,594
- A hallucination.
- Yeah, that's it.

194
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,933
Now, did that feel like a hallucination?

195
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:51,615
And how was the reunion?

196
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,284
I'm gonna let him,
uh, spin out for a bit,

197
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:58,589
then go in for the kill, so to speak.

198
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,257
- Gentlemen.
- What the hell

199
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,426
- is going on here?
- That's what I was gonna ask.

200
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,594
Aren't you supposed to be searching for

201
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,562
- the Kalabros Manuscript?
- I was.

202
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,197
And I found him and I brought him here.

203
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,199
We no longer need the Manuscript.

204
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,568
We have a different problem.
The Legends are here.

205
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,437
We know. I just punched Mick.

206
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,339
Not those Legends.

207
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,608
And I'm not your Eobard.
I'm from the future.

208
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,909
Yeah, what else is new?

209
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,178
Okay. I mean your future.

210
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,113
One where we have the Spear of Destiny.

211
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,849
And the Legends from that
future are here now, too.

212
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,517
Wait, there are two sets of Legends?

213
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,921
- When do I get to rob a bank?
- Just deal with them.

214
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,390
Where do you think you're going?

215
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,894
To get backup.

216
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:40,163
I hate when he does that.

217
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,175
- You know what to do.
- We'll hang back

218
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:53,810
and make sure everybody
sticks to the script

219
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:55,946
Okay, I figure we got
about an hour before we...

220
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,981
Shut up, pretty. I'm calling the shots.

221
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,817
I'm the thief.
Englishman, disable Gideon.

222
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:02,920
We can't risk her blowing our cover.

223
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,091
You round up everyone in the library.

224
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:09,993
Make sure the coast is clear.

225
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,195
Then I can snatch the item.

226
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:15,198
You know what? This is
gonna be a piece of cake.

227
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,469
Hey. What are you guys doing?
You just left for the church.

228
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:21,371
So we did. And now we're back.

229
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,807
The church was a dead end, I'm afraid.

230
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,443
- Where's Ray?
- He is returning

231
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,046
Lieutenant Tolkien
to the field hospital.

232
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,816
You guys all right?

233
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,319
Yeah! I'm just seeing double.

234
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,820
Yeah, we're... we're fine. We're fine.

235
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,522
I just need to get to
the library so I can,

236
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,825
you know, locate Christ's blood.

237
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,161
I need to run some repairs on Gideon.

238
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,931
Yeah, and I need to
get the Spear... a beer.

239
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,308
Yeah, well, as long as we get it first.

240
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:56,873
Are you not supposed to be
guarding the Spear of Destiny?

241
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,109
Mr. Rory offered to spell me.

242
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,944
I thought you and Lieutenant Tolkien

243
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,879
were going to the Church at Amiens.

244
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:04,381
Uh, yeah, that didn't work out.

245
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,418
But I did happen to find the...

246
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,956
Nate.

247
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,126
I, um, I... I was
just saying that I, uh,

248
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,429
believe I found the final
resting place of Sir Gawain.

249
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:25,606
- So do you wanna tell us?
- Tell you?

250
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:27,604
- Are you feeling all right?
- You look like

251
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,373
you've seen a ghost.

252
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,141
No... yeah, no. I'm... I'm fine.

253
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,743
Yeah, sorry, I...

254
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,045
I... I think the location
of Gawain and, you know,

255
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:38,015
the Blood of Christ is in the, um...

256
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,721
Galapagos Islands.

257
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,524
The Blood of Christ is
in the Galapagos Islands?

258
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:50,594
Yeah. In 1984.

259
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,562
How could a relic from the Crusades

260
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:56,600
wind up in the Galapagos during
the Reagan Administration?

261
00:13:56,602 --> 00:14:00,303
Perhaps Gideon can help. Gideon?

262
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:02,773
Oh, no. Where's Gideon?

263
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,408
I'm gonna go and check on her.

264
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,476
I'll come with you.

265
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,880
Why are you looking at me like that?

266
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,448
What's going on?

267
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,717
I miss you so much.

268
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,619
You've been gone for five minutes.

269
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:21,958
I got it!

270
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,797
Where's pretty?

271
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,399
- Away team, what's your status?
- Uh, we have the Spear,

272
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,068
but Dr. Heywood is running behind.

273
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,702
What the hell is he doing?

274
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,244
- Where the hell have you been?
- Eh, um...

275
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:44,181
I'm, uh, I'm sorry. I just
got... I got distracted.

276
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,482
We gotta get out of here.

277
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,851
Negative.

278
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,352
We got a new problem.

279
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:51,455
Your old selves are back.

280
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,157
Hang on. You mean that we've
returned from the church?

281
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,626
Yes, and if you come
out of the ship now,

282
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:59,663
they'll see you and wreck time itself.

283
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,466
You're trapped in there.

284
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,034
Good one!

285
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:12,200
We have to stop them
from getting to the ship.

286
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:16,629
Guys.

287
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:19,265
We have a... a new problem.

288
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:21,767
The ship... it's broken.

289
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:25,071
Uh, well what Sara means
is there's a radiation leak.

290
00:15:25,073 --> 00:15:27,540
- Radiation leak?
- Yes, and it's very dangerous

291
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:28,808
so we need to keep our distance.

292
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,942
If you could just follow me this way.

293
00:15:29,944 --> 00:15:31,210
Wait, where's Amaya?

294
00:15:31,212 --> 00:15:33,946
She's safe. We got everyone...

295
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:35,715
off of the ship right away.

296
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:39,619
Except Grey, who's working
on fixing the ship right now.

297
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:42,121
I thought you said it was
too dangerous to be on board.

298
00:15:42,123 --> 00:15:44,257
What's a little radiation

299
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:47,159
for one half of Firestorm?

300
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:53,399
I assumed we'd be on
our way to 1984 by now.

301
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:55,401
Yeah, Rip took Gideon offline.

302
00:15:55,403 --> 00:15:57,770
Said something about an efficiency scan,

303
00:15:57,772 --> 00:15:59,405
which should've been done by now.

304
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:01,507
- How strange.
- Yeah, like how Nate was acting

305
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:04,310
- in the library.
- Shouldn't Raymond be back

306
00:16:04,312 --> 00:16:06,445
from returning Tolkien to his regiment?

307
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:08,614
Ray. What's your 20?

308
00:16:08,616 --> 00:16:12,084
Uh, I'm standing right in front of you.

309
00:16:12,086 --> 00:16:15,187
Ray, listen to me: whoever
that is, she's an imposter.

310
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:18,124
- Take her out.
- What about the other Jax?

311
00:16:18,126 --> 00:16:21,127
Whoa, whoa, wait. There's
a fake version of me, too?

312
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:23,505
- Yeah.
- Ray, whoever this bozo is,

313
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:24,997
kick his ass!

314
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:30,236
- With pleasure.
- Okay. Huh.

315
00:16:30,237 --> 00:16:32,837
- Sorry, Sara.
- For what?

316
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,240
Listening to you.

317
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:35,841
- Whoa!
- Big dude, chill out, bro!

318
00:16:35,843 --> 00:16:38,110
- What are you doing?
- We're not imposters!

319
00:16:38,112 --> 00:16:40,780
This is madness! What
has come over you people?

320
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:42,114
If you would...

321
00:16:42,116 --> 00:16:45,384
- Oh, Ray!
- ...just...

322
00:16:45,386 --> 00:16:48,120
let me explain!

323
00:16:48,122 --> 00:16:50,389
If fake me is anything like real me,

324
00:16:50,391 --> 00:16:52,358
Ray's gonna need some help.

325
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,994
Copy that, Captain.

326
00:16:57,665 --> 00:16:59,732
Enough waiting, we
gotta get out of here.

327
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:02,568
We can't. Our prior selves
our out there right now.

328
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,104
If we leave, they'll see us.

329
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:06,205
Then don't go.

330
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:07,606
Whoa.

331
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:09,308
Mr. Jackson, I can explain.

332
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,843
That you're the Legion in disguisg?

333
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:14,113
Yeah, I know.

334
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:18,351
Thawne's face changing
technology is incredible.

335
00:17:18,353 --> 00:17:19,618
Hang on.

336
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:24,423
I don't think she's an imposter.

337
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:27,760
This is the genuine Ms.
Lance and Mr. Jackson.

338
00:17:27,762 --> 00:17:29,195
W-what?

339
00:17:29,197 --> 00:17:31,897
But you told us never
to revisit our past.

340
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:33,733
Why would they do that?

341
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:35,634
You'll have to ask them that.

342
00:17:39,707 --> 00:17:42,141
They almost made it
off the ship with this.

343
00:17:42,142 --> 00:17:45,377
All right. Who's wearing whose faces?

344
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,047
We are not the Legion.
Believe it or not,

345
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:50,416
we are actually future
iterations of yourselves

346
00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:51,817
who've travelled back in time to prevent

347
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:54,086
some form of calamity.

348
00:17:54,088 --> 00:17:56,756
I don't believe it. Why would Rip Hunter

349
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:59,024
break the first rule of time travel?

350
00:17:59,026 --> 00:18:03,763
I'm asking myself the
very same question.

351
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:05,598
Oh, bollocks.

352
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:10,136
What the hell was that?

353
00:18:10,138 --> 00:18:11,570
It's a timequake.

354
00:18:11,572 --> 00:18:13,939
The result of us
interacting with ourselves.

355
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:16,342
- Well, that wasn't so bad.
- Yeah, give it time.

356
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:17,977
Whose bright idea was it

357
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:21,280
to do the one thing that
could jeopardize all of time?

358
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:22,448
Yours.

359
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,183
What the hell are you staring at?

360
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:26,685
Just imagining what you'd
look like without teeth.

361
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,987
Knock it off, Rory.

362
00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:29,455
I can't believe that even we

363
00:18:29,457 --> 00:18:30,656
would do anything so foolish,

364
00:18:30,658 --> 00:18:32,691
unless something went terribly wrong

365
00:18:32,693 --> 00:18:34,126
the first time you were here.

366
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:36,295
Uh, I can't help but notice...

367
00:18:36,297 --> 00:18:38,597
Not all of us came back with you.

368
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:41,133
What happens to us in the future?

369
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:46,238
Well...

370
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,608
dead, dead, good as dead.

371
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,610
Look, the Spear ended
up in the Legion's hands.

372
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:53,479
Bad things happened and it sucked.

373
00:18:53,481 --> 00:18:55,981
But if we prevent the Legion
from ever getting the Spear

374
00:18:55,983 --> 00:18:58,150
in the first place, everything
goes back to normal

375
00:18:58,152 --> 00:18:59,552
and you all get to live.

376
00:19:02,457 --> 00:19:06,992
- Where are you going?
- To think.

377
00:19:06,994 --> 00:19:08,794
Perhaps you should go with her.

378
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:12,331
- Two heads are better than one.
- Yeah.

379
00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:21,507
In the future you're from,
the Legion gets the Spear.

380
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:24,577
Yes.

381
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:26,779
So this is my fault.

382
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:30,349
It's more of a team effort, really.

383
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:33,319
Can I ask you a question?

384
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:35,621
Do you wish you would have used it?

385
00:19:35,623 --> 00:19:37,156
- No.
- But you could've

386
00:19:37,158 --> 00:19:38,858
stopped all of this.

387
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,930
You could've erased the
Legion of Doom from existence.

388
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:43,562
You could have kept your team alive.

389
00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:49,201
You know why I... We can't use it.

390
00:19:49,203 --> 00:19:54,340
The Spear... It draws on our desires,

391
00:19:54,342 --> 00:19:58,143
our weaknesses, our hatred.

392
00:19:58,145 --> 00:20:00,513
Our darkness.

393
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:04,583
We're not strong enough to wield it.

394
00:20:04,585 --> 00:20:06,852
The spear is a weapon.

395
00:20:06,854 --> 00:20:09,121
And you know what we do with weapons.

396
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:18,964
Doing some light reading
on Zembezi, I see.

397
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:20,733
What do you want?

398
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:23,234
I came here to drop some
future knowledge on you.

399
00:20:23,237 --> 00:20:24,737
You need to do yourself a favor

400
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:26,438
and stop being the ambassador of chill

401
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,241
and tell Amaya how you feel about her.

402
00:20:29,243 --> 00:20:32,378
Okay. How do I feel about her?

403
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,281
You're in love with her.

404
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:38,484
Look, I...

405
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:42,588
I really, really like Amaya.

406
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:46,191
I saw Leonard Snart put a
gun to her head and kill her.

407
00:20:46,193 --> 00:20:48,894
I watched Amaya die.

408
00:20:48,896 --> 00:20:51,497
I lost her forever.

409
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:55,434
You understand me?

410
00:20:55,436 --> 00:20:57,303
What do you want me to do?

411
00:20:57,305 --> 00:20:58,671
We all wanna change the future.

412
00:20:58,673 --> 00:21:00,139
I'm not talking about the future.

413
00:21:00,141 --> 00:21:02,274
I'm talking about
changing who you are now.

414
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:05,244
I want you to do the things
I wish I would've done

415
00:21:05,246 --> 00:21:08,113
instead of the things
I wish I would've said.

416
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:10,382
You wanna know why?

417
00:21:10,384 --> 00:21:14,019
Because there's nothing... Nothing worse

418
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:17,723
than looking back at
your life with regret.

419
00:21:32,573 --> 00:21:34,473
- Yep. Still weird.
- Please tell me you two

420
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:36,108
have figured a way out of this mess.

421
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,278
Uh! Clearly not.

422
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
- Was that another timequake?
- I don't think so.

423
00:21:41,282 --> 00:21:43,349
- Someone's firing at us.
- Captain, our shields

424
00:21:43,351 --> 00:21:48,287
- are nearly depleted.
- Copy that.

425
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:52,324
Sorry, habit.

426
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:55,427
That was a bit powerful for
World War I air artillery.

427
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,337
That would explain it.

428
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:06,939
The ship's taking too much damage.

429
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:08,273
We gotta make a time jump.

430
00:22:08,275 --> 00:22:10,009
I really would not recommend that.

431
00:22:11,445 --> 00:22:14,546
- Outta my way.
- Hey, that's my seat!

432
00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:16,548
Travelling through time with ourselves

433
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,684
could create a paradox
exponentially larger

434
00:22:18,686 --> 00:22:20,753
than the one we have already created.

435
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,189
- What do you think?
- That we have to do

436
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:25,524
whatever it takes to keep the Spear

437
00:22:25,526 --> 00:22:27,226
out of the Legion's hands.

438
00:22:27,228 --> 00:22:29,028
Hold on.

439
00:22:36,003 --> 00:22:37,670
- What's going on?
- It's the result of us

440
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:39,738
interacting with our previous selves.

441
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,073
It's a time-storm.

442
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:02,155
We're still in World War I.

443
00:23:02,157 --> 00:23:03,956
Gideon, get us out of here.

444
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,358
Negative, Captains.

445
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,260
The ship has sustained critical damage.

446
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,228
Well, good news. The time-storm seems

447
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,564
to have caused a temporary ceasefire.

448
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:15,201
The bad news is the Legion of
Doom's still trying to kill us.

449
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:17,570
Wait, how far do you
even think we'll be able

450
00:23:17,571 --> 00:23:20,005
- to make it out there?
- You only have to make it

451
00:23:20,008 --> 00:23:21,407
as far as the other Waverider.

452
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:24,277
You want us to time jump together again?

453
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,045
Uh... you saw what just happened.

454
00:23:26,047 --> 00:23:28,481
We won't be time jumping together.

455
00:23:28,483 --> 00:23:32,018
You're not coming with us.

456
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,154
This has always been a
one-way ticket for us.

457
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:41,494
Your team has to get
the Spear of Destiny

458
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:45,198
away from here.

459
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,300
We won't fail you guys.

460
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,408
- Guys, we've got company.
- I see 'em.

461
00:23:56,678 --> 00:23:58,744
Everybody clear on the plan?

462
00:23:58,746 --> 00:24:01,447
Run like hell. Try not to die.

463
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:04,350
What about you guys? You ready?

464
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,918
Other than the fact
that I can't Firestorm

465
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,186
and Nate can't Steel?

466
00:24:07,188 --> 00:24:09,288
You bet your sweet ass we're ready.

467
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,583
- Damn it.
- Damien, I think we should

468
00:24:37,585 --> 00:24:40,553
- go back to basics.
- Yeah, you're right.

469
00:24:40,555 --> 00:24:43,623
Killing's gotten so gosh
darn impersonal lately.

470
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:47,393
Ah.

471
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:53,866
Uh, uhh!

472
00:24:57,572 --> 00:24:59,172
Ah, ahh.

473
00:25:06,281 --> 00:25:07,914
No!

474
00:25:14,255 --> 00:25:16,689
No.

475
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:20,359
Jefferson, no, please. Please!

476
00:25:23,364 --> 00:25:26,832
Ah!

477
00:25:30,171 --> 00:25:32,772
Grey!

478
00:25:32,774 --> 00:25:34,740
Come on, Grey.

479
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,409
Come on, come on.

480
00:25:43,651 --> 00:25:45,952
Ahh!

481
00:25:45,954 --> 00:25:48,554
Let him go, Mick.

482
00:25:48,556 --> 00:25:50,423
I'm not listening to you anymore.

483
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:53,593
Come on, is that any way
to talk to your old partner?

484
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:56,629
I don't have a partner. I have a team.

485
00:25:56,631 --> 00:25:59,432
Yeah, Darhk said you'd gone soft.

486
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:02,401
Lemme fix that for you.

487
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:07,173
Uh.

488
00:26:07,175 --> 00:26:10,409
Mick, no! No!

489
00:26:15,383 --> 00:26:18,317
- What's your problem?
- You're... you're alive!

490
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,787
You hug me, I'll kill you.

491
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,322
Okay. Later.

492
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:29,428
Hey! The Waverider's just around...

493
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,998
Ahh!

494
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,969
I thought you were made of steel.

495
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:38,170
No!

496
00:26:38,172 --> 00:26:40,439
Get this in the ship.

497
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:44,677
Oh, I've been waiting for this.

498
00:26:49,884 --> 00:26:51,417
Ah, ahh!

499
00:27:04,365 --> 00:27:05,831
Ahh!

500
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,600
Ohh!

501
00:27:10,772 --> 00:27:12,438
Ah.

502
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:16,509
What are you waiting for?

503
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:19,011
Do it.

504
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,247
Death would be too kind.

505
00:27:24,385 --> 00:27:26,552
Nice work. Both of you.

506
00:27:26,554 --> 00:27:27,920
Where's the Spear?

507
00:27:27,922 --> 00:27:29,989
You took it to the rendezvous point.

508
00:27:29,991 --> 00:27:31,390
Oh, did I? Right.

509
00:27:31,392 --> 00:27:33,426
If you don't wanna get stuck in 1916,

510
00:27:33,428 --> 00:27:35,261
get to the ship now.

511
00:27:35,263 --> 00:27:37,963
That means you, Amaya.

512
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:42,435
Nathaniel.

513
00:27:42,437 --> 00:27:45,304
Don't be a douche.

514
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:47,340
Excuse me?

515
00:27:47,342 --> 00:27:50,276
I won't, bro.

516
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:09,395
- I can't believe we made it.
- Don't jinx it.

517
00:28:11,699 --> 00:28:13,199
Aw, he jinxed it!

518
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:16,902
I hate that guy.

519
00:28:20,174 --> 00:28:21,807
Not that guy.

520
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:26,712
These guys!

521
00:28:29,951 --> 00:28:31,851
You travelled back in
time to help yourselves,

522
00:28:31,853 --> 00:28:33,552
I figured I could do the same.

523
00:28:33,554 --> 00:28:34,920
You know, it's true what they say.

524
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:37,356
If you want something done right,

525
00:28:37,358 --> 00:28:39,492
you really have to do it yourself.

526
00:28:47,181 --> 00:28:52,180
Give me the Spear and
I'll spare your team.

527
00:28:52,182 --> 00:28:53,515
You can go to hell.

528
00:28:53,517 --> 00:28:55,917
No, but I'll make a hell for you.

529
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,920
Do you really wanna lose another one?

530
00:28:58,922 --> 00:29:01,089
Last chance.

531
00:29:01,091 --> 00:29:03,091
Use the Spear.

532
00:29:06,296 --> 00:29:08,396
B'khi-eel.

533
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:10,131
Ah-ash-lem-tu-on.

534
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:13,735
K'i-aheen. Kh'det Bay-all-ma-ah.

535
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:22,610
It can't be me. Use it. Fix the world.

536
00:29:22,612 --> 00:29:24,646
- Just do it, Sara!
- Look, I can't.

537
00:29:24,648 --> 00:29:26,080
There's too much darkness inside of me.

538
00:29:26,082 --> 00:29:27,315
I can't control it.

539
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,089
I believe in you.

540
00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:36,958
You're stronger than you know.

541
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:58,012
There's no place like home.

542
00:29:58,014 --> 00:29:59,347
Well, the cork broke off,

543
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:02,684
but I think I managed to salvage it.

544
00:30:02,686 --> 00:30:04,252
Here.

545
00:30:10,693 --> 00:30:12,551
To doing movie night more often.

546
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:22,286
This never happened.

547
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:27,308
This is the Spear doing this.

548
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:30,144
This isn't real.

549
00:30:30,146 --> 00:30:32,280
No, it's not,

550
00:30:32,282 --> 00:30:34,883
but it can be.

551
00:30:34,885 --> 00:30:39,320
You can remake reality
however you see fit.

552
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:50,265
You were always
the better of us, Laurel.

553
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:53,868
You were the strong one.

554
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:57,238
I'm damaged.

555
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,007
I know.

556
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:10,351
The Gambit,

557
00:31:10,353 --> 00:31:12,520
Lian Yu,

558
00:31:12,522 --> 00:31:14,455
League of Assassins,

559
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:16,691
you dying.

560
00:31:16,693 --> 00:31:19,894
I could take it all back.

561
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:21,829
But you won't.

562
00:31:24,734 --> 00:31:27,402
Everything...

563
00:31:27,404 --> 00:31:30,438
that has happened to me...

564
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,175
All the suffering that I endured,

565
00:31:34,177 --> 00:31:38,746
it's all led to this moment, hasn't it?

566
00:31:38,748 --> 00:31:42,083
The Spear doesn't need
someone pure of heart.

567
00:31:42,085 --> 00:31:46,454
It needs someone strong
enough to do the right thing.

568
00:31:46,456 --> 00:31:49,691
Sara, it needs you.

569
00:31:49,693 --> 00:31:53,261
Even if doing the right thing...

570
00:31:53,263 --> 00:31:55,897
means not having you back?

571
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,901
I'm never too far away.

572
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:07,742
I love you.

573
00:32:07,744 --> 00:32:10,845
I love you, too.

574
00:32:15,552 --> 00:32:18,386
Too slow, Ms. Lance.

575
00:32:18,388 --> 00:32:20,755
Far too slow.

576
00:32:20,757 --> 00:32:25,126
To think you had actual godhood

577
00:32:25,128 --> 00:32:28,396
literally in your grasp.

578
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:31,399
Well, I'm not going to make the
mistake I made the first time.

579
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:35,236
I'm going to erase
you all from existence.

580
00:32:35,238 --> 00:32:36,738
You won't even be dead.

581
00:32:38,942 --> 00:32:41,075
B'khi-eel. Ah-ash-lem-tu-on.

582
00:32:41,077 --> 00:32:42,410
K'i-aheen.

583
00:32:42,412 --> 00:32:43,945
Kh'det Bay-all-ma-ah.

584
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:51,586
I may have made one
small change to reality.

585
00:32:51,588 --> 00:32:55,590
You depowered the Spear.

586
00:32:55,592 --> 00:32:59,794
Well, I guess we'll just have
to do this the old fashioned way.

587
00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:02,697
I am going to drive
this through your heart.

588
00:33:05,201 --> 00:33:08,736
Yeah. About that...

589
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:16,144
No.

590
00:34:15,939 --> 00:34:17,472
You did it.

591
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:20,341
You would've done the same thing.

592
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,448
Remember, Legends never die.

593
00:34:34,691 --> 00:34:37,625
Really? "Goonies"?

594
00:34:37,627 --> 00:34:39,660
What's a goonie?

595
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:41,429
Ehh.

596
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:57,953
All right, Malcolm is back
in 2016, where he belongs.

597
00:34:57,955 --> 00:35:00,856
- In prison?
- No.

598
00:35:00,858 --> 00:35:02,557
His crappy apartment.

599
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,593
And what are your
plans for the two of us?

600
00:35:04,595 --> 00:35:07,596
We're dead in 2017, remember?

601
00:35:07,598 --> 00:35:10,499
I'm not taking you back to 2017.

602
00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:20,575
Should've done this in France, Mick.

603
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:23,278
Could've saved us both a lot of time.

604
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,107
I didn't bring you here
to kill you, Leonard.

605
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,544
So what are we doing here?

606
00:35:28,547 --> 00:35:31,720
This is where Thawne
recruited you for the Legion.

607
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,628
I'm gonna wipe your memory
and put you on the right path.

608
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,764
You mean the path where I
join up with some Brit twit

609
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,534
and die trying to save the world?

610
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:49,838
No, you die trying to save your friends.

611
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,274
Still a death sentence.

612
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:55,143
You know what your
punishment is, Leonard?

613
00:35:55,145 --> 00:35:58,313
You end up being a better man.

614
00:35:58,315 --> 00:36:00,082
And so do I.

615
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:01,550
Better?

616
00:36:01,552 --> 00:36:03,618
You mean softer.

617
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,821
No.

618
00:36:05,823 --> 00:36:07,622
I mean better.

619
00:36:10,027 --> 00:36:11,760
Mm.

620
00:36:21,672 --> 00:36:23,605
All right, so let me get this straight.

621
00:36:23,607 --> 00:36:26,742
In retaliation for me
helping kill your team,

622
00:36:26,744 --> 00:36:28,710
bending reality and torturing you,

623
00:36:28,712 --> 00:36:32,514
I'm to wear this ridiculous
outfit and shoes without socks?

624
00:36:32,516 --> 00:36:34,282
Just setting things right.

625
00:36:34,284 --> 00:36:38,086
You mean setting me on the
path to killing your sister.

626
00:36:38,088 --> 00:36:40,922
I've already made that choice.

627
00:36:40,924 --> 00:36:43,091
I'm okay with it.

628
00:36:43,093 --> 00:36:45,694
And so is Laurel.

629
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,329
And how do you know that?

630
00:36:56,507 --> 00:37:00,709
Hey, Gideon said we're
going back to 1942.

631
00:37:00,711 --> 00:37:03,211
The mission's over. The
Legion's been put back

632
00:37:03,213 --> 00:37:06,181
in their proper places
in the timeline, so...

633
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:08,817
now it's my turn.

634
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:11,535
Okay, um...

635
00:37:11,538 --> 00:37:13,655
Well, if you don't
mind, I'd like to get off

636
00:37:13,657 --> 00:37:17,793
- at that stop with you.
- What?

637
00:37:17,795 --> 00:37:20,028
Look, I lost you once already,

638
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:24,533
even though it was a different
me and a different you.

639
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:26,902
And I don't ever wanna do that again.

640
00:37:26,904 --> 00:37:30,472
Or at all.

641
00:37:30,474 --> 00:37:32,441
I don't know what to say.

642
00:37:32,443 --> 00:37:36,311
Say, "Nate, come with me to 1942."

643
00:37:36,313 --> 00:37:39,448
I can't say that, Nathaniel.

644
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:43,718
Because I don't want to go back to 1942.

645
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,354
I know that I'm supposed to.

646
00:37:46,356 --> 00:37:48,957
I know I have a destiny and
that we shouldn't damage time

647
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:52,461
any more than we already
have, but I have to believe

648
00:37:52,463 --> 00:37:55,330
that time is stronger than that.

649
00:37:55,332 --> 00:37:58,567
And that if I have a destiny,

650
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:00,936
it'll wait for me.

651
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,847
Hey, you going on a trip?

652
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:15,250
Uh, yes, in fact.

653
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:17,552
I was joking.

654
00:38:17,554 --> 00:38:19,754
Right. Yes, well, we both know

655
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,556
that I don't have a
sense of humor at times.

656
00:38:21,558 --> 00:38:25,230
But, uh, yes, I am taking my leave.

657
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:26,766
What do you mean, "leave"?

658
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:28,930
This team has functioned
far better in my absence

659
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,932
than it ever did under my leadership.

660
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:35,103
- You saved reality itself.
- Well, you were there, too.

661
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:38,073
Yes, but I've realized
that there's nothing further

662
00:38:38,075 --> 00:38:40,041
for me to teach you.

663
00:38:40,043 --> 00:38:42,043
- Any of you.
- So, what?

664
00:38:42,045 --> 00:38:45,280
You're just gonna walk out
of here and not say good-bye?

665
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:47,349
I was going to borrow
the jump ship, actually.

666
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:49,351
I think Mick would call that stealing.

667
00:38:49,353 --> 00:38:51,186
Oh, yes. Well, maybe Mr. Rory

668
00:38:51,188 --> 00:38:54,356
has had somewhat of an affect on me.

669
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:56,558
And you on me, Captain.

670
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,927
Ah, I'm no longer the captain.

671
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:01,263
You are.

672
00:39:01,265 --> 00:39:05,433
And in that spirit...

673
00:39:05,435 --> 00:39:08,803
permission to depart, Captain Lance.

674
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:11,006
Permission granted.

675
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,745
Stay out of trouble.

676
00:39:16,747 --> 00:39:18,613
What, without you lot?

677
00:39:18,615 --> 00:39:20,949
I think that'll actually be quite easy.

678
00:39:36,033 --> 00:39:39,134
Mick, you wanna do the
honors? Plot a course?

679
00:39:39,136 --> 00:39:41,002
You earned it.

680
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:44,072
Gideon, set a course for Aruba.

681
00:39:44,074 --> 00:39:45,507
Roger that, Mr. Rory.

682
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:48,643
Setting a course for
Aruba, the year 2017.

683
00:39:50,247 --> 00:39:51,846
- What was that?
- This is what happens

684
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:54,616
when you put Mr. Rory
in charge of navigation.

685
00:39:54,618 --> 00:39:56,718
In fact, it was another time-storm.

686
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,254
It seems the disruption
you created in 1916

687
00:39:59,256 --> 00:40:01,056
was just the start.

688
00:40:05,596 --> 00:40:07,629
We've been ejected out
of the Temporal Zone.

689
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,100
- Get ready for a hard landing.
- Oh, come on!

690
00:40:12,102 --> 00:40:15,337
Can we please go five minutes
without crashing the Waverider?

691
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:30,952
Is everyone okay?

692
00:40:30,954 --> 00:40:32,220
This ain't Aruba.

693
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:35,390
No, this is Los Angeles, 2017.

694
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:37,359
Oh, boy.

695
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:45,022
Guys.

696
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,828
I think we broke time.

697
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:05,601
