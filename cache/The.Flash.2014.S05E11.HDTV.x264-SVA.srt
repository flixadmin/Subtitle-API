1
00:00:00,478 --> 00:00:01,746
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,749 --> 00:00:03,909
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:05,111
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,114 --> 00:00:07,259
I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist,

5
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:10,166
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

6
00:00:10,168 --> 00:00:13,003
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

7
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:15,356
But when my daughter came
back from the future to help,

8
00:00:15,358 --> 00:00:17,691
she changed the present,

9
00:00:17,693 --> 00:00:20,343
and now our world is
more dangerous than ever,

10
00:00:20,345 --> 00:00:22,696
and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.

11
00:00:22,698 --> 00:00:25,404
I am the Flash.

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,852
Previously on "The Flash"...

13
00:00:28,854 --> 00:00:31,354
Let's dance, crickets-y.

14
00:00:31,356 --> 00:00:32,898
How can she still come out?

15
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,042
Because she's immune to Cicada's dagger?

16
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:37,234
The shards weren't dampening my powers.

17
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,808
They were removing them.

18
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:40,953
We could make a meta-human cure.

19
00:00:40,956 --> 00:00:42,866
- What this is?
- What is that, Nora's journal?

20
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:44,218
Have you seen this code before?

21
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:46,238
Yeah, right after Barry
came out of the Speed Force.

22
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,708
- It's a time language.
- Time language?

23
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,294
Where does one learn
something like that?

24
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:52,351
- I created it, actually.
- Clever girl.

25
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,424
My God, Orlin.

26
00:01:06,427 --> 00:01:08,975
You scared the living
daylights out of me.

27
00:01:08,977 --> 00:01:10,936
Did anyone follow you?

28
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,913
Of course not.

29
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:14,915
It's been weeks since
you fought the Flash

30
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:16,825
at the hospital. If
anyone knew you were here,

31
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,627
you would have found out by now.

32
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:20,654
I got you some groceries

33
00:01:20,656 --> 00:01:23,073
and some Meloxicam for your injuries.

34
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:25,876
I don't need it.

35
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,721
Good to hear.

36
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:31,840
- How's Grace?
- Nothing's changed.

37
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,960
She's stable. CCPD hasn't left

38
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,937
and they're not leaving any time soon.

39
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:39,703
- Well, I need to see her, Doc.
- That's not possible.

40
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:44,111
Don't tell me what's possible.

41
00:01:44,113 --> 00:01:47,323
You're angry. Good.

42
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:49,085
For all the pain your
family has suffered

43
00:01:49,088 --> 00:01:50,922
at the hands of those
metas, you should be.

44
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:53,621
But right now there isn't
anything you can do for Grace,

45
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:57,482
so put that anger
towards something else.

46
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,368
I have a friend who feels the same way

47
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:01,027
about meta-humans as we do,

48
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:03,964
and he wants to help you
finish what you've started.

49
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,802
Orlin?

50
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:11,121
It's time to get back to work.

51
00:02:20,316 --> 00:02:22,724
This is it. The only thing between us

52
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:26,177
and our big score is one
reinforced concrete wall.

53
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:29,180
- Don't hurt yourself, Bork.
- Can't hurt Bork.

54
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,663
But Bork can hurt you.

55
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,351
Hyah!

56
00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:36,646
That should do it.

57
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:41,627
The hell?

58
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,528
Hyah!

59
00:02:53,248 --> 00:02:55,557
Ah!

60
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,653
You're one, too.

61
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,133
Ah!

62
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:21,283
Ah!

63
00:03:26,301 --> 00:03:29,531

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

64
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:31,960
I don't know what's
crazier, how big this guy is

65
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,743
or the number of incised
wounds on his body.

66
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,916
Well, and the depressed skull
fracture points to impact

67
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,894
with hardened surface,
but cause of death

68
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:40,656
is definitely repeated stabbings.

69
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:43,188
Yeah, looks like
someone was really angry.

70
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,039
Look at these wounds.

71
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:47,383
Doesn't it look like they have
the same depth and diameter

72
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:48,736
as the ones on Gridlock's body?

73
00:03:48,738 --> 00:03:51,087
Yeah, and like Block's
and Raelene Sharp's.

74
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,556
Yeah.

75
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:55,600
Iris just got a tip.

76
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,788
Another meta-human was murdered
in her apartment, same C.O.D.

77
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:02,023
- Dad, these aren't one offs.
- No.

78
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:03,983
Cicada's back and he's
on a killing spree.

79
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:06,025
Okay, well, there's got to be
a lead in one of these attacks

80
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:08,387
that can help us track him.
We'll get the team on it.

81
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:14,963
Killer Frost, seriously?
I can't take it anymore.

82
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:17,672
Uh, Caitlin, is everything... oh.

83
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,850
Alter-ego confab.

84
00:04:19,852 --> 00:04:21,966
Seen enough episodes of "Sister, Sister"

85
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:23,861
to recognize a sibling
spat when I see one.

86
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,516
Oh. So, I'm trying to help Cisco

87
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,902
with his meta-human cure,

88
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:29,573
but every time I start working on it,

89
00:04:29,576 --> 00:04:32,576
Killer Frost takes over and
messes with my equations.

90
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:33,947
Like this.

91
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:36,702
She changed all my
heterozygotes into asterisks.

92
00:04:36,705 --> 00:04:39,895
Oh, I thought those were
just tiny snowflakes.

93
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:42,604
So she's not on board?

94
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:45,334
No, and I don't exactly know why.

95
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:48,040
- Can't you just ask her?
- Oh, I've tried.

96
00:04:48,043 --> 00:04:49,889
But every time we
start talking about it,

97
00:04:49,892 --> 00:04:52,488
she starts singing
Barney's "I Love You" song.

98
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:54,376
- Ooh, that's cold.
- Yeah.

99
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,110
What about Cisco? Is he having any luck?

100
00:04:56,113 --> 00:04:57,328
Not yet.

101
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,806
He went to the Tannhauser off-sites

102
00:04:58,808 --> 00:05:01,124
so he could concentrate.
He says it's quiet there.

103
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:04,043
Yeah. Quiet like a tomb.

104
00:05:04,045 --> 00:05:07,192
So I think if I can
isolate the genetic marker

105
00:05:07,195 --> 00:05:09,132
that bonds human DNA to dark matter,

106
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:10,892
I can reverse engineer the process

107
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,969
and unravel it to create a cure.

108
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:16,377
- That's great.
- Yeah, except I need meta-DNA

109
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,713
that hasn't fully bonded
with dark matter yet.

110
00:05:18,716 --> 00:05:20,643
Of course, because as we all know

111
00:05:20,645 --> 00:05:23,897
with genetic modification we... Why?

112
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:25,833
Because that's the only
time when I can identify

113
00:05:25,835 --> 00:05:27,105
where the marker is in the genome.

114
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:28,526
Okay, so you need DNA

115
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,337
from a meta-human who
was created recently?

116
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:32,989
Yeah, ideally in the last eight months,

117
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:36,201
but everyone I can think of
has been killed by Cicada.

118
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,161
Right.

119
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:40,013
So where the heck do we look?

120
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,209
The lone decrypted entry

121
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,295
from the journal of Nora West-Allen:

122
00:05:47,297 --> 00:05:50,506
"The timeline is malleable."

123
00:05:50,508 --> 00:05:53,777
Why that's the only one that translated?

124
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:56,438
And why is she interested
in the timeline,

125
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,389
and maybe more important,

126
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,350
why is she hiding this interest?

127
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,020
Sherloque, we need you in the cortex.

128
00:06:04,022 --> 00:06:05,831
But of course.

129
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:13,212
Kira May, Dwayne Geist, Carl Bork.

130
00:06:13,215 --> 00:06:15,790
All three metas who were
killed by Cicada last night.

131
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,575
So Cicada's killed almost as many people

132
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,220
in the last 12 hours as he
has in the last eight months?

133
00:06:20,222 --> 00:06:22,247
And it doesn't look like he's
slowing down anytime soon.

134
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,415
Well, we need to stop him
before he hurts anyone else.

135
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,563
Sherloque, do you have any
ideas on what to do about that?

136
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:28,878
Not at the moment, but any
time I run into a road block

137
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,755
in an investigation,
I do what I always do.

138
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:34,175
I just pursue a different avenue.

139
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:36,185
We'll find him. Something
will bring him to us.

140
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,771
Something like...

141
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,555
Satellites picking up dark matter flare.

142
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:41,300
- It's him.
- Something like that.

143
00:06:41,303 --> 00:06:42,771
Suit up. We don't have a lot of time.

144
00:06:42,773 --> 00:06:46,353
Not without precautions.
For Killer Frost.

145
00:06:46,356 --> 00:06:51,309
She doesn't need a weapon.
Killer Frost is the weapon.

146
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,273
Powers or no powers, I will mess you up.

147
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:17,502
Ah!

148
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:18,937
Negate this!

149
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:28,822
Hold on. Help!

150
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,574
We need Caitlin.

151
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:35,520
We need to get her to a hospital.

152
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,164
Here, come with me.

153
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:47,248
Ah!

154
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:52,504
Huh?

155
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,547
Aah!

156
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,091
No!

157
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:59,001
Aah!

158
00:08:04,392 --> 00:08:06,509
Nora. Hey, Nora, Nora?

159
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:10,280
Okay, Nora... Nora?

160
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,981
Nora?

161
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,518
Well?

162
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:33,653
Cicada caused an axial burst fracture

163
00:08:33,656 --> 00:08:37,358
in her L3, L4, and L5 vertebrae.

164
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:39,861
He also severely displaced

165
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:43,698
her fourth thoracic vertebrae.

166
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,712
It's not good.

167
00:08:45,715 --> 00:08:47,869
But her speed healing is
going to kick in, right?

168
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:53,041
Right?

169
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:56,628
Cicada's cut flooded her
body with dark matter.

170
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,789
It's affecting her powers.

171
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,883
Her speed healing should kick in...

172
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:03,635
for now.

173
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:08,748
I'll keep monitoring her progress.

174
00:09:14,064 --> 00:09:18,424
- Barry.
- It's okay, she'll heal.

175
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:21,144
It'll be all right.

176
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:25,574
Nora?

177
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:29,077
Oh, what happened?

178
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:30,878
Honey, um...

179
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:33,655
Oh, why does it hurt to breathe?

180
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:36,150
It's gonna hurt for a little bit.

181
00:09:36,152 --> 00:09:38,461
Why?

182
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:42,606
I can't move my legs.

183
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:46,076
Um, why can't I move my legs?

184
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:48,263
- Mom, I can't move my legs.
- Nora.

185
00:09:48,265 --> 00:09:50,414
Mom? Mom, why can't I move my legs?

186
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,626
Nora, look.

187
00:09:53,628 --> 00:09:57,254
You can't move your legs because...

188
00:09:57,256 --> 00:09:59,941
Cicada broke your back.

189
00:09:59,943 --> 00:10:02,134
What? So I'm paralyzed?

190
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:04,374
- What, forever?
- No, no, not forever.

191
00:10:04,377 --> 00:10:06,723
Well, for how long then?

192
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:11,536
We don't know.

193
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:17,286
Mom...

194
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:19,429
Hey, I got here as fast as I could.

195
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:20,629
Joe's still in Tibet.

196
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:22,372
I left him a message to get back ASAP.

197
00:10:22,374 --> 00:10:24,466
Hey, it's all right. He
should stay with Wally.

198
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:25,634
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.

199
00:10:25,636 --> 00:10:27,302
Hi.

200
00:10:29,288 --> 00:10:33,666
- How is she?
- It's not good.

201
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:36,127
I'm so sorry, Barry.

202
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:37,868
Hey, I don't care how we do it.

203
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,358
- We need to stop Dwyer now.
- Well, I agree.

204
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:41,765
All right, Well, I'm gonna call Cisco.

205
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,800
- We should get him back here.
- No, no, no, he...

206
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:45,728
He should finish the
cure he's working on.

207
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:47,063
His time is better spent there.

208
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:48,597
- Sherloque.
- Oui?

209
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:50,891
- Earn your money.
- How do we track this guy?

210
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:52,610
Well, I think the
first thing we should do

211
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:54,854
is concentrate on the
victims. Look for a connection.

212
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:57,407
Take a look here for
example. This man, Geist,

213
00:10:57,409 --> 00:10:59,242
has a spider tattoo on his neck,

214
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:01,744
generally indicating he was
caught in some form of web.

215
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:05,581
What kind of web? A prison web, perhaps.

216
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,491
And Kira May... She was wearing clothes.

217
00:11:07,493 --> 00:11:09,344
Of course she was
wearing clothes, Giraffe.

218
00:11:09,346 --> 00:11:11,662
No, she was wearing clothes
that are two sizes too large.

219
00:11:11,664 --> 00:11:13,745
- Two sizes too large.
- Recent rapid weight loss.

220
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:15,759
It's a common side effect
of solitary confinement.

221
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:17,048
- Right.
- And Carl Borg...

222
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,688
And Carl Borg, this report
says he had a droopy eyelid

223
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,274
which is nerve paralysis,

224
00:11:21,277 --> 00:11:24,100
common side effect of
consuming too much borat.

225
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:26,695
Or as it's known on this earth, bruno.

226
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:28,104
More commonly known as prison wine.

227
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:29,197
Prison wine.

228
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:30,365
All three of these meta-humans

229
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:32,808
were former criminals.

230
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,025
Look at this.

231
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:36,028
It's a meta-human arrest log from 2018.

232
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:37,497
Look at the first three names.

233
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:38,803
These were his victims.

234
00:11:38,806 --> 00:11:40,481
He's killing in the order of this list.

235
00:11:40,484 --> 00:11:42,784
This list has addresses,
employment information.

236
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:44,904
It's got license plate
numbers. This is everything

237
00:11:44,906 --> 00:11:46,631
Cicada needs to find them.

238
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:48,448
Where would he even get this?

239
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:50,201
I think there's only one place, right?

240
00:11:53,223 --> 00:11:56,799
There's a killer still at large in our city.

241
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:59,969
People are afraid of
being out in the streets.

242
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:02,379
I'm getting 100 phone
calls a day about this guy.

243
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:04,090
I want neighborhoods re-canvassed.

244
00:12:04,092 --> 00:12:06,801
I want evidence re-examined. Jonesy!

245
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:09,404
Take your unit and paper
the city with Dwyer's photo.

246
00:12:09,406 --> 00:12:12,932
I want this guy. Let's go get him!

247
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:18,187
Allen?

248
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:20,439
We need to talk... in private.

249
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:21,824
All right.

250
00:12:23,945 --> 00:12:25,444
What the hell is this?

251
00:12:25,446 --> 00:12:28,656
That's how Dwyer's getting his victims.

252
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:32,460
This is from our database of meta-humans?

253
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:34,670
Well, it doesn't prove
he got it from CCPD.

254
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:35,940
Doesn't it?

255
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:37,507
He could have broken
into another precinct

256
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:39,917
or hacked into the CCPD database.

257
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,844
David Dwyer is a machinist.
He's not a hacker.

258
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:43,796
Somebody gave this
to him. Somebody here!

259
00:12:43,798 --> 00:12:45,464
Okay, Barry, maybe we should go ahead

260
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:48,851
and let Captain Singh
look into this on his own.

261
00:12:48,854 --> 00:12:50,562
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

262
00:12:56,102 --> 00:12:57,527
Thank you, David.

263
00:12:57,529 --> 00:12:59,603
Hey, Barry. Barry.

264
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,816
Barry, where are you going?

265
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:05,201
I don't know, Cecile,

266
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:06,456
but I gotta do something

267
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:08,695
before Dwyer kills all
the people on that list.

268
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:10,832
Hey.

269
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:13,084
What if we use it, too?

270
00:13:13,086 --> 00:13:14,712
- What?
- The list.

271
00:13:14,715 --> 00:13:16,886
Three years ago, Joe asked
me to help get meta-humans

272
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:18,306
transferred out of the city.

273
00:13:18,308 --> 00:13:20,166
Yeah, I remember. You
told him not to do it.

274
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:23,460
Yeah, well, that was before
I knew what I know now.

275
00:13:23,462 --> 00:13:25,480
Besides, those metas
were active prisoners.

276
00:13:25,482 --> 00:13:27,756
These metas, they've
already served their time.

277
00:13:27,758 --> 00:13:29,725
Look, even if we got 'em out
of town, it wouldn't matter.

278
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,442
Cicada's gonna track
them down eventually.

279
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:33,229
They need new names, new identities.

280
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:34,773
We don't have the resources to do that.

281
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:36,491
No, we do not.

282
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:38,024
But the Feds do.

283
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:39,476
They give this kind of protection

284
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:40,826
to regular humans all the time.

285
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:42,329
It is about time they start offering it

286
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:44,072
to meta-humans, too.

287
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:46,859
I am going to go call in
every favor I have ever banked

288
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:48,578
and I am going to
make this thing happen,

289
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,656
and in the meantime, you need
to go get them somewhere safe.

290
00:13:52,658 --> 00:13:54,709
- All right.
- Okay.

291
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:04,185
So, can you try wiggling your toes?

292
00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:09,465
I can't.

293
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:11,112
Again?

294
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:13,090
I can't.

295
00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:19,225
- Anything?
- I don't feel anything.

296
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:22,394
Okay, well, Cicada's dark
matter has left your system,

297
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:24,563
so you should be healing soon.

298
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:26,649
I mean, since my last
scan, your spinal axons

299
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:27,950
have grown five millimeters.

300
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:29,568
That's something, right?

301
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:31,196
It's progress.

302
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,268
Maybe not quite the
speed we were hoping for,

303
00:14:33,271 --> 00:14:34,966
but it's something.

304
00:14:36,962 --> 00:14:38,968
I'm going to go run a few more tests.

305
00:14:45,072 --> 00:14:47,355
Hey.

306
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:49,909
Don't give up, okay?

307
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:52,546
Growth is growth.

308
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:58,071
Normal axon growth rate
reaches five millimeters

309
00:14:58,074 --> 00:15:01,317
a day in a large nerve.

310
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:04,487
With speed healing,
mine should be over 100.

311
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:06,488
How do you know that?

312
00:15:06,491 --> 00:15:08,582
I took neuro-regeneration

313
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:11,294
in my fifth grade STEM class.

314
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:15,780
I took fractions in fifth grade.

315
00:15:19,763 --> 00:15:23,765
What if I don't heal, Mom?
What if I never get better?

316
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:31,238
Can I just be left alone
for a little bit, please?

317
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:37,428
Yeah. Okay.

318
00:15:52,445 --> 00:15:55,129
I respect your right to
protest the cure, Frosty,

319
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:58,541
but even for me, that is excessive.

320
00:15:58,543 --> 00:16:01,014
Well, maybe Caitlin
will get the hint now.

321
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:02,804
Uh...

322
00:16:02,806 --> 00:16:06,382
Snow and Frost are having
creative differences.

323
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:07,717
I'll get Caitlin.

324
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:11,565
No, I-I need you, actually.

325
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:13,612
We need to get all those
metas to a safe house

326
00:16:13,615 --> 00:16:15,099
before Cicada finds them.

327
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:18,144
Oh, and you think they're
going to listen to me?

328
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:19,487
50-50 on that.

329
00:16:19,489 --> 00:16:22,306
I haven't quite lived up to my name.

330
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:25,660
But I do know where we should start.

331
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:33,335
Doesn't look like anyone's
been here in months.

332
00:16:33,338 --> 00:16:35,694
Maybe the rumors about
Amunet skipping town are true.

333
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:38,822
We're not here for Amunet.
We're here for her pet snake.

334
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:40,699
And the thing about snakes is,

335
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:43,702
they're always lurking
in some dark corner.

336
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:50,426
Hello, Norvock.

337
00:16:50,428 --> 00:16:53,521
Frost, thank God it's you.

338
00:17:00,997 --> 00:17:03,566
Those are Cicada's targets,
but we need your help

339
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:05,425
rounding everyone up so
we can get them to safety.

340
00:17:05,427 --> 00:17:07,427
Because they're not going
to trust a bunch of masks?

341
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:10,361
They will if you tell them
it's for their own good.

342
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,180
Some of these guys are bad news.

343
00:17:12,183 --> 00:17:14,442
- You sure they're worth saving?
- Are you?

344
00:17:14,445 --> 00:17:16,652
Cicada's not going to
stop until every meta

345
00:17:16,655 --> 00:17:19,439
in this city is dead. Is
that how you want to end up?

346
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:22,492
Damn. What did he do to you?

347
00:17:22,495 --> 00:17:24,142
We've arranged for everyone to enter

348
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:25,403
a witness protection program.

349
00:17:25,405 --> 00:17:26,780
Federal agents will lead you

350
00:17:26,782 --> 00:17:29,333
out of the city to safety tonight.

351
00:17:29,335 --> 00:17:32,577
All right.

352
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:36,340
I'm in, but only if I'm the
first one on that transport.

353
00:17:36,342 --> 00:17:38,416
Nice of you to look out
for your fellow metas.

354
00:17:38,418 --> 00:17:40,269
I look out for me and me alone.

355
00:17:40,271 --> 00:17:41,837
Then let's get to rounding up.

356
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,522
Yup.

357
00:17:47,094 --> 00:17:49,278
- David.
- If this is about that list...

358
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,572
It is, but it's not what you think.

359
00:17:51,574 --> 00:17:54,266
I need your help.

360
00:17:54,268 --> 00:17:55,934
With what?

361
00:17:55,936 --> 00:17:58,311
I'm having those metas
moved to federal protection,

362
00:17:58,313 --> 00:18:00,981
- which is where you come in.
- What do you need?

363
00:18:00,983 --> 00:18:05,193
Road blocks, tonight, from
Linsin to Webber Avenue.

364
00:18:05,195 --> 00:18:07,904
I know, David, I know, but I can't risk

365
00:18:07,906 --> 00:18:10,991
any incoming traffic during
the scheduled transfer.

366
00:18:10,993 --> 00:18:12,134
I'll make it happen.

367
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:14,244
Thank you.

368
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,667
Officer Jones.

369
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:23,587
- You all right?
- Never better.

370
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,978
I'm tired of waiting.

371
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,374
This Cicada, he wants to kill us?

372
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:47,202
I say we kill him first.

373
00:18:47,205 --> 00:18:49,821
You can't. We're your only chance.

374
00:18:49,823 --> 00:18:51,781
- So you keep saying.
- Look, if you're too dumb

375
00:18:51,783 --> 00:18:52,976
to recognize the truth,

376
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:54,986
then you can go, but you're on your own.

377
00:18:54,989 --> 00:18:57,930
I'm not going to watch anybody
else be broken by this maniac.

378
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:03,419
He's telling the truth.

379
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:07,141
I saw Cicada kill Carl Bork.

380
00:19:07,144 --> 00:19:08,924
Bork's dead?

381
00:19:08,926 --> 00:19:11,935
His dagger took away our powers.

382
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:15,513
I ran, Bork fought.

383
00:19:15,515 --> 00:19:18,016
That's why I'm here and he's not.

384
00:19:18,018 --> 00:19:21,203
So, yeah, leave if you want,

385
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:24,210
but I'm gonna listen to these guys

386
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:26,208
and stay alive.

387
00:19:37,555 --> 00:19:39,773
That was quite the speech back there.

388
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:41,592
Almost seemed like you actually wanted

389
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:43,141
to save those meta-humans.

390
00:19:43,144 --> 00:19:46,094
No, you know me better than that.

391
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:49,389
No, I don't think I do.

392
00:19:49,391 --> 00:19:53,051
I used to be a good guy, you know?

393
00:19:53,053 --> 00:19:57,555
I worked at the Central City
Zoo, watching the reptile cage.

394
00:19:57,557 --> 00:20:01,911
We were open the night the
particle accelerator blew up.

395
00:20:01,913 --> 00:20:04,771
After the blast shattered all the cages,

396
00:20:04,773 --> 00:20:08,733
I had to pull an elapid snake off a kid.

397
00:20:08,735 --> 00:20:11,370
Then that dark matter hit.

398
00:20:11,372 --> 00:20:12,755
What happened to the kid?

399
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:15,925
He's fine.

400
00:20:15,927 --> 00:20:19,286
But what do I get,
huh? A snake in my head?

401
00:20:19,288 --> 00:20:22,089
And a psycho killer that wants me dead?

402
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:26,626
That was the last time I put
anyone else before myself.

403
00:20:36,471 --> 00:20:40,098
You know, it's almost like
a small part of me feels

404
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,483
sorry for that guy.

405
00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:44,102
Why? He's only out for himself.

406
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:47,364
Come on, he's clearly terrified.

407
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:49,107
I know what that's like.

408
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:50,420
You're going to tell me

409
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:54,446
that you've never felt fear like that?

410
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:57,449
- No, why?
- Really?

411
00:20:57,451 --> 00:21:02,805
Not even a little bit worried
about Caitlin making the cure?

412
00:21:09,838 --> 00:21:13,941
- Is that everyone?
- Everyone except Shawna Baez.

413
00:21:13,943 --> 00:21:16,151
A meta that calls herself Peek-A-Boo?

414
00:21:16,153 --> 00:21:17,677
Anyone know where she'll be?

415
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,846
Try the Sundollar on Eighth.

416
00:21:21,158 --> 00:21:22,566
All right.

417
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,792
Bar's not open yet.
Not even for you, Flash.

418
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:33,243
Shawna.

419
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:35,737
I need you to come with me.

420
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:37,581
I didn't do anything this time.

421
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,063
I know. You're not in trouble.

422
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:40,250
All right, you're in danger.

423
00:21:40,252 --> 00:21:41,659
I want to take you some place safe.

424
00:21:41,662 --> 00:21:45,181
Like your science prison? Sorry.

425
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:49,259
Shawna? Please.

426
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:51,066
Somebody is trying to kill you.

427
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:53,778
Someone's always trying to kill me.

428
00:21:53,781 --> 00:21:55,714
See ya around, Flash.

429
00:22:00,213 --> 00:22:02,297
What did you do to me?

430
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,392
Shawna, run.

431
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:09,038
Who the hell is that?

432
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,442
Take this, press the button.

433
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:12,449
When a breach opens, jump into it.

434
00:22:14,378 --> 00:22:15,952
Go!

435
00:22:18,698 --> 00:22:20,174
Hyah!

436
00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:24,419
Come on, come on...

437
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,153
Make this thing work.

438
00:23:03,996 --> 00:23:07,557
They're all terrified. I can feel it.

439
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,768
Maybe now they believe us.

440
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:11,775
Hey, we're almost through this.

441
00:23:11,778 --> 00:23:14,246
We are going to get all
of these people to safety.

442
00:23:14,248 --> 00:23:16,489
Even if we do, Cicada's
not going to stop killing.

443
00:23:16,491 --> 00:23:21,178
- Not until...
- Until he's dead.

444
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,330
- I didn't say that.
- You didn't have to.

445
00:23:24,332 --> 00:23:26,591
The anger that I feel
from you says it all.

446
00:23:26,593 --> 00:23:28,593
How am I supposed to feel?
He almost killed Nora.

447
00:23:28,595 --> 00:23:30,708
Barry, I understand, I do.

448
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:34,170
That man hurt your child.

449
00:23:34,173 --> 00:23:36,360
But this anger that you're feeling,

450
00:23:36,362 --> 00:23:38,052
I have felt it before...

451
00:23:38,054 --> 00:23:40,814
from Cicada.

452
00:23:40,816 --> 00:23:43,892
Honey, if you let it,
this rage will consume you,

453
00:23:43,894 --> 00:23:46,286
the same way it's already consumed him.

454
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:52,209
Wait, I have felt this
anger from someone before.

455
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:54,265
At CCPD. Oh, my God, Barry,

456
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:55,731
I think I know who leaked the list.

457
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:56,779
Then let's go get him.

458
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:58,615
No, no, no, you... You stay here.

459
00:23:58,617 --> 00:24:00,575
You get these metas to the drop.

460
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:01,736
I can handle the rest.

461
00:24:17,403 --> 00:24:20,466
Ah, well, look. Neurological delight.

462
00:24:20,469 --> 00:24:22,077
Why, you'll be back on these feet

463
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,057
and chasing Cicada in no time.

464
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,992
- I hope so.
- Yes. In the meantime,

465
00:24:25,995 --> 00:24:27,485
maybe you can help me do the same.

466
00:24:27,487 --> 00:24:29,395
Oh, I already told the
team everything I know

467
00:24:29,397 --> 00:24:31,823
- about the Flash museum.
- Flash museum, right.

468
00:24:31,825 --> 00:24:34,117
Do you think that I
could look at the archives

469
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,252
from that Flash museum?

470
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:37,087
After all, I have made a career

471
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:40,999
out of noticing things
that other people miss.

472
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:43,952
Maybe it's not a problem
to bring those archives

473
00:24:43,954 --> 00:24:45,888
for me to look at?

474
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,598
Yeah, I guess so.

475
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,776
Or maybe it's easier for me to go there?

476
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:53,103
You want me to bring you to the future?

477
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:55,880
Mm. It's a great suggestion.

478
00:24:55,882 --> 00:24:58,547
Is it even possible for a non-speedster

479
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,292
to go into the commodity...
What'd you call it? The, um...

480
00:25:01,295 --> 00:25:04,689
- The Speed Force?
- Speed Force. Right.

481
00:25:04,691 --> 00:25:06,608
Uh, I'm not sure.

482
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,693
Mm. Right.

483
00:25:08,695 --> 00:25:10,567
Well, perhaps that's a question

484
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,647
for someone with more experience.

485
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:15,066
- Sherloque.
- Mm?

486
00:25:15,068 --> 00:25:17,628
Can I talk to you for a second?

487
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,463
Excusez-moi.

488
00:25:26,538 --> 00:25:28,846
- That's my daughter in there.
- Yes, so?

489
00:25:28,849 --> 00:25:31,165
And I'm going to do whatever
it takes to protect her.

490
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:34,219
Even from people who I
thought were her friends.

491
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:36,122
So I'm gonna need you
to tell me right now

492
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:37,722
why you're investigating Nora.

493
00:25:37,724 --> 00:25:39,298
Invest... no, no. Quoi?

494
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,443
No one's investigating Nora.

495
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:46,431
Quoi? No one's investigating Nora.

496
00:25:49,736 --> 00:25:53,497
Maybe I'm investigating
Nora a little bit.

497
00:25:53,499 --> 00:25:55,189
Why?

498
00:25:55,191 --> 00:25:57,150
You think, what, Nora
is hiding something?

499
00:25:57,152 --> 00:25:59,360
No, um...

500
00:25:59,362 --> 00:26:01,246
How can I say this?

501
00:26:01,248 --> 00:26:03,173
Sometimes when you're a detective,

502
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:05,395
you see a story and you follow it.

503
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:07,826
And there's different tracks.

504
00:26:07,829 --> 00:26:09,537
You follow down the track.

505
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:12,206
With Nora, I am
following down this track.

506
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:13,850
Do you know how many stories I've chased

507
00:26:13,852 --> 00:26:15,752
- that went absolutely nowhere?
- Mm.

508
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:18,355
So many that I stopped
chasing them for a while

509
00:26:18,357 --> 00:26:20,214
instead of doing what
I should have done,

510
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:22,317
something you suggested, actually,

511
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,152
which is going down a different track.

512
00:26:24,154 --> 00:26:26,029
Mm.

513
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:29,682
That track is the wrong one.

514
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:35,372
Careful with your little monocle.

515
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:38,542
Learn to take notes like everyone else.

516
00:26:38,544 --> 00:26:42,507
Nora!

517
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:46,194
Oh, my goodness.

518
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,849
What do you want, Ralph?

519
00:26:55,085 --> 00:26:56,535
I know it's none of my business

520
00:26:56,538 --> 00:26:57,919
why you're afraid of a cure,

521
00:26:57,921 --> 00:27:03,049
but for what it's worth, I'm a meta,

522
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:05,426
and I'm all for it.

523
00:27:05,428 --> 00:27:07,988
And after talking with most
of those people out there...

524
00:27:09,306 --> 00:27:11,641
- So are some of them.
- Oh, yeah, I can see that.

525
00:27:11,651 --> 00:27:13,726
I just don't understand why.

526
00:27:13,728 --> 00:27:15,487
It might save their lives.

527
00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:17,247
It's not that simple for me.

528
00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:18,915
Why not?

529
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:21,544
Because, just like Norvock
didn't ask for his snake,

530
00:27:21,547 --> 00:27:23,069
Caity didn't ask for me.

531
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:26,197
So if one day she wakes up
scared of being a meta-human

532
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:28,500
and decides to take that cure,

533
00:27:28,502 --> 00:27:30,835
her powers don't just disappear.

534
00:27:30,837 --> 00:27:32,888
I do too.

535
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,581
That's what I'm really afraid of.

536
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:38,143
'Cause if I'm gone who's
going to protect her?

537
00:27:40,213 --> 00:27:42,680
It's witching hour.

538
00:27:46,594 --> 00:27:51,764
I get why you're scared, but...

539
00:27:51,766 --> 00:27:54,820
you need to know that when
DeVoe made you disappear,

540
00:27:54,823 --> 00:27:57,787
all Caitlin talked about
was getting you back.

541
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,803
So maybe as much as
you want to protect her,

542
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:03,339
Caitlin wants to protect you, too.

543
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:15,245
I went after three of them
tonight and they weren't there.

544
00:28:15,248 --> 00:28:17,874
Did you tip them off?

545
00:28:19,645 --> 00:28:21,769
No, I swear.

546
00:28:21,772 --> 00:28:23,963
After what that Spencer woman did to me

547
00:28:23,965 --> 00:28:27,675
with her meta-tech, I want them all gone.

548
00:28:27,677 --> 00:28:30,645
- Then what happened?
- The D.A.

549
00:28:30,647 --> 00:28:32,305
She figured out you're
targeting everyone

550
00:28:32,307 --> 00:28:33,731
on the list I gave you.

551
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:35,183
The contact of mine with the Feds

552
00:28:35,185 --> 00:28:36,517
says they're being picked up

553
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:37,982
and put into protective custody.

554
00:28:37,985 --> 00:28:40,738
Tonight.

555
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,833
Where?

556
00:28:55,681 --> 00:29:00,638
Boys and girls, your ride's here.

557
00:29:02,093 --> 00:29:03,638
What the hell?

558
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,595
Everybody get back!

559
00:29:20,854 --> 00:29:23,396
Thank you, Flash,

560
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:26,525
for bringing them all to me.

561
00:29:30,946 --> 00:29:32,779
The chopper's not going
to be able to land.

562
00:29:32,782 --> 00:29:35,152
Take everybody out the back
and get them on it somehow.

563
00:29:35,155 --> 00:29:36,463
Come on.

564
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:41,501
No, he's mine.

565
00:29:41,503 --> 00:29:42,677
Hyah!

566
00:29:57,657 --> 00:29:59,686
All right, we're out
of the dampening field.

567
00:29:59,688 --> 00:30:02,021
Shawna, can you help?

568
00:30:02,023 --> 00:30:04,116
Every meta for themselves.

569
00:30:08,363 --> 00:30:10,947
What now?

570
00:30:10,949 --> 00:30:13,458
I don't suppose you can
run up my arm, can you?

571
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,335
Ralph, what are you planning to do?

572
00:30:15,337 --> 00:30:16,953
Remember, Baby Giraffe,

573
00:30:16,955 --> 00:30:18,821
they took a leap of faith with you.

574
00:30:18,823 --> 00:30:21,541
That's why I'm going to take
a leap for them, Shirley.

575
00:30:21,543 --> 00:30:24,094
All right, everybody.
Straight line, single file,

576
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:25,336
tuck your arms in.

577
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:38,633
- Keep this thing steady.
- Roger that.

578
00:30:45,308 --> 00:30:46,849
Stand there!

579
00:30:46,851 --> 00:30:49,310
Tuck your arms.

580
00:31:18,692 --> 00:31:21,072
You can't win this fight.

581
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:23,191
I bet I can.

582
00:31:23,194 --> 00:31:25,845
We haven't been formally introduced.

583
00:31:25,848 --> 00:31:29,475
They call me Killer
Frost. Let me show you why.

584
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,791
Ah!

585
00:31:50,748 --> 00:31:54,208
Ugh.

586
00:32:10,268 --> 00:32:12,860
Killer Frost, duck!

587
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:34,109
- You saved me.
- You saved them first.

588
00:32:34,112 --> 00:32:35,728
Nice work.

589
00:32:35,731 --> 00:32:38,190
Let's get out of here for real!

590
00:32:51,568 --> 00:32:53,660
Give him hell, Flash!

591
00:32:57,866 --> 00:33:00,558
Okay, you see, the metas
are on the move. Bravo.

592
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,173
- Something's wrong with Barry.
- What?

593
00:33:02,176 --> 00:33:05,129
I've never seen these kind
of readings from Barry's suit.

594
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,159
He's channeling over 2.86
billion joules of energy.

595
00:33:10,161 --> 00:33:11,803
That's a combined equivalent

596
00:33:11,805 --> 00:33:13,621
of... of almost three lightning bolts.

597
00:33:13,623 --> 00:33:15,640
Cicada's powers allow
him to sustain injury

598
00:33:15,642 --> 00:33:17,583
- but not that much.
- Barry.

599
00:33:17,585 --> 00:33:20,312
Barry.

600
00:33:29,197 --> 00:33:31,615
He's not going to stop.

601
00:33:32,933 --> 00:33:36,967
You're never gonna
hurt my daughter again!

602
00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:43,234
- Aah!
- Dad!

603
00:33:43,236 --> 00:33:45,144
No.

604
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:09,552
Oh, I'm sorry. I let him get away.

605
00:34:09,554 --> 00:34:13,439
No, you brought me back.

606
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:26,156
Alright, the Feds have processed Norvock

607
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,284
and the other metas,
giving them new identities,

608
00:34:28,287 --> 00:34:30,287
so everybody's safe.

609
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:32,779
Satellite hasn't registered
any unaccounted for dark matter

610
00:34:32,782 --> 00:34:35,745
so, wherever Dwyer is,
his dagger's not in use.

611
00:34:35,748 --> 00:34:38,874
Psh, after the beating
Barry gave him, ain't no way

612
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,882
he's using that dagger anytime soon.

613
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,073
What? He got what he deserved.

614
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:50,494
Oh, no, I think we
appreciate your groove.

615
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:54,215
Also I think that Killer Frost
and the Flash combination is

616
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,458
enough to maybe have Dwyer
not want to show his face

617
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,010
around here any time soon.

618
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,461
Dad, are you okay?

619
00:34:59,463 --> 00:35:00,619
I'm good.

620
00:35:00,622 --> 00:35:02,622
What matters is that you're okay.

621
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:05,425
How's it feel to be
up and running again?

622
00:35:05,428 --> 00:35:06,896
Super frickin' schway.

623
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:09,679
Uh, wanna know what's
not super frickin' schway?

624
00:35:09,682 --> 00:35:11,950
Cicada knowing exactly when and where

625
00:35:11,952 --> 00:35:13,642
our secret transport was taking place.

626
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,830
Mm. Inside job, right?

627
00:35:16,832 --> 00:35:20,948
Cicada clearly has a inside man, only...

628
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:23,169
Only what kind of cop would help Cicada

629
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:24,453
kill innocent people?

630
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:29,619
One that's going to have to
answer to D.A. Cecile Horton.

631
00:35:31,704 --> 00:35:33,829
Captain, you wanted to see me?

632
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,890
Come on in.

633
00:35:35,892 --> 00:35:37,374
Officer Jones,

634
00:35:37,376 --> 00:35:39,168
this was printed off of your hard drive.

635
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,929
Copy of the list of metas
that Cicada's been pursuing.

636
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,548
Funny thing, it is the same list

637
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,008
that we know you accessed

638
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,977
on your home computer just this week.

639
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,261
Care to tell me why you decided

640
00:35:49,264 --> 00:35:50,665
to aid and abet a murderer?

641
00:35:50,668 --> 00:35:53,848
No, that's not... you don't
know what you're talking about.

642
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,518
Really?

643
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,564
A woman used meta-human tech
to take control of your mind.

644
00:36:00,566 --> 00:36:03,034
She made you do things
that you were certain

645
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:06,120
you would never do.

646
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,197
And that frightened you, didn't it?

647
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,908
It frightened you and it made you angry,

648
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:13,553
and you went ahead and
you embraced that anger

649
00:36:13,555 --> 00:36:16,080
and you let it drive your every move.

650
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,798
Betrayal. Revenge.

651
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,381
Escape.

652
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:34,556
The metas in this city have
no respect for human life.

653
00:36:34,558 --> 00:36:36,725
They don't deserve to breathe our air.

654
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,412
You swore an oath to protect
the citizens of this city.

655
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:43,399
Every one of them.

656
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:46,420
Get him out of my sight.

657
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,762
You know, your instincts
have always been sharp.

658
00:36:55,764 --> 00:36:58,097
But knowing he was
going to try to escape?

659
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:01,267
Could have swore you were
reading Jonesy's mind.

660
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:08,048
It's a funny thing, yeah.

661
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,926
Since Jenna was born, I've been

662
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,928
a lot more in touch with my feelings.

663
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:17,058
When Joe gets back, the two of you

664
00:37:17,061 --> 00:37:19,829
will be a force to be reckoned with.

665
00:37:19,832 --> 00:37:22,082
Oh, we already are.

666
00:37:31,948 --> 00:37:34,507
Killer Frost, you shouldn't have.

667
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,893
It's the closest you're getting

668
00:37:35,896 --> 00:37:38,626
to an apology from me, so...

669
00:37:38,629 --> 00:37:41,203
Well, maybe that's why I can hear you

670
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:43,656
without the M.A.D. 2.0.

671
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:45,554
Or maybe it's because
you've stopped hating me.

672
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:46,837
I didn't hate you.

673
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,429
I thought you were being stupid.

674
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,058
There's a difference.

675
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,859
Hey, you know I'd never
take that cure, right?

676
00:37:53,862 --> 00:37:55,819
Even if it means sharing a body with me

677
00:37:55,822 --> 00:37:57,490
until you get old and grey?

678
00:37:57,492 --> 00:37:58,951
Of course.

679
00:37:58,954 --> 00:38:01,736
You're a part of me that
I never want to lose.

680
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:05,689
I promise, I will do
everything I can to protect you.

681
00:38:05,691 --> 00:38:07,931
Right back at you, Caity.

682
00:38:07,934 --> 00:38:09,508
Now, don't get all soft on me,

683
00:38:09,511 --> 00:38:11,216
but I got you a little something.

684
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:13,697
Check the cooler.

685
00:38:23,643 --> 00:38:27,762
Hey, Frosty. Oh, Caitlin.

686
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:32,099
Is that a ball of ice
with blood inside of it?

687
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,194
I think Killer Frost
took it from Cicada.

688
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:37,554
Ralph, this isn't just blood.

689
00:38:37,557 --> 00:38:41,660
This is a DNA sample from a
recently created meta-human.

690
00:38:43,396 --> 00:38:46,247
- So Killer Frost came around.
- Yeah.

691
00:38:46,249 --> 00:38:47,898
She did.

692
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,538
Ugh, I said don't get soft.

693
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:55,547
Begin handwriting analysis.

694
00:39:03,892 --> 00:39:07,635
As I suspected, the
journal of Nora West-Allen

695
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,838
contains two different
types of handwriting.

696
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,690
So...

697
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,293
There is a mastermind behind the scenes.

698
00:39:18,296 --> 00:39:21,398
The only question is...

699
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,242
who?

700
00:39:32,194 --> 00:39:36,422
Okay, 47 tacos is officially my limit.

701
00:39:36,424 --> 00:39:38,999
I think that's anyone's limit, honey.

702
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,899
A healing speedster's gotta eat.

703
00:39:40,902 --> 00:39:44,263
Healed, Dad. I'm fine.

704
00:39:44,265 --> 00:39:45,807
I promise.

705
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:48,584
Hey, uh, dinner again tomorrow night?

706
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:52,421
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Nora? Um...

707
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,965
I just...

708
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:57,968
just want you to know
how much we love you.

709
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:17,112
See? She's back to her old self.

710
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:20,040
And so are you.

711
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:23,660
No, I'm not.

712
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:26,605
In fact, I don't think
I'll ever be the same.

713
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:32,416
All of this has made me
realize that, I don't know,

714
00:40:32,419 --> 00:40:36,463
I just... I never knew I
was capable of even caring

715
00:40:36,466 --> 00:40:39,109
for someone as much
as I care about Nora.

716
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:43,990
I did.

717
00:40:43,992 --> 00:40:48,143
I've never met anyone with a
bigger heart than you, Barry.

718
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,145
So it's no surprise to me that you are

719
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:53,574
a fantastic father.

720
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,711
Just like you're a fantastic husband.

721
00:41:00,032 --> 00:41:04,251
Cicada's a father, too.

722
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,955
What if the key to defeating
him is appealing to his heart?

723
00:41:07,957 --> 00:41:10,758
- How do we do that?
- By saving his child.

724
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:15,546
We need to wake up Grace.

725
00:41:42,765 --> 00:41:48,164
