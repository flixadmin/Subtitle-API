1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,478
<i>Previously on</i>
Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,473
An unknown number of other dangerous
magical beings got spat out

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,597
across the timeline and now
must be sent to hell.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,555
Your shapeshifting days are over,
sweetheart.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,757
- No!
- Is that a Kaupe?

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,936
<i>This is a prison, Mona.</i>

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,111
<i>And they are our prisoners,
not our friends.</i>

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,352
People around me get hurt,
killed or far, far worse.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,039
But you can't mess with your past.

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,480
<i>Des.</i>

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,320
Order up!

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,520
Last one.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,671
Oi, oi. Wake up, John-O!

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,030
Piss off, will ya!

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,556
Oh, not today, you lying geezer!

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,954
- What the...
- You said that my shapeshifting days

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,430
- were over.
- You call that abomination

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,636
shapeshifting, do you?

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,519
Well, if I can shift at all,
that means your spell is reversible.

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,640
You see, that's where you're wrong,
sweetheart.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,275
There's no taking it back.

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,597
Smart man like you, John-O,
you can figure it out.

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,720
Yeah, well, mortal life
is full of disappointments.

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,400
Best get used to it, love.

25
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,559
It's all right. That's all right.

26
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,200
You know how I survived
in the prison dimension?

27
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,315
Trading favors.

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,034
Now, sooner or later,
you're gonna need something from me.

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,799
Then we'll talk, chum.

30
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,400
Thanks for staying
at my place this time.

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,955
I love sleeping next to you.

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,914
I just wish that your place didn't
mean sharing a bathroom with...

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,676
- Beer.
- Yes, Garima.

34
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,991
Beer, it's the only word
Rory taught her.

35
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,800
Wait, Rory's still using Brigid's
diary?

36
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,520
That thing is an ancient
magical artifact.

37
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,875
Yeah, but it keeps him happy.

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,916
Sara, be reasonable.

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,593
You can't let Rory keep the diary.

40
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,870
I see you've met Garima.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,357
What she lacks in vocabulary,
she makes up for in personality.

42
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,952
And everyone knows that a happy Mick
is better for the entire ship.

43
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,994
- Whoa!
- Oh!

44
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,876
- Killer 'stache!
- Interesting.

45
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,676
You think? I had Gideon stimulate
my hair follicles to grow it overnight.

46
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,716
I read in one of Nora's letter's
that she had a thing for mustaches.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,118
Sorry, but how are we all being
so blasé about the diary?

48
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,119
What if Rory goes
from writing sci-fi to horror?

49
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,896
Do you want killer clowns running
around the ship?

50
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,992
The only killer on the ship is
the amount of sugar in this cereal.

51
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,000
"Big Easy O's"?

52
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,710
They taste like beignets. So sweet,
it makes your lips pucker.

53
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,158
Oh, there's a quiz on the back.

54
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,474
"Who is the most prolific
serial killer in the United States?"

55
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,279
Ted Bundy. Although in my opinion,

56
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,795
John Wayne Gacy had way more victims
than he confessed.

57
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,076
What?

58
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,555
Everyone has their hobbies.

59
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,880
Sorry, Ava, but according to this
not so kid-friendly cereal,

60
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,591
the answer is New Orleans' own
Marie Laveau.

61
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,830
What?

62
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,880
A high-profile female serial killer?
No, I would have heard of her.

63
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,196
The box is wrong.

64
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,114
Unless... Gideon.

65
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,400
You are correct, Captain.
It appears a fugitive

66
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,511
is on the loose in New Orleans
in 1856.

67
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,195
According to local lore,
there were a series of murders

68
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,480
perpetrated by a criminal
who could walk through walls.

69
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,791
Sounds like we're going mind huntin'
in the Big Easy.

70
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,476
Gideon. Plot a course.

71
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,590
Unbelievable.

72
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,512
You just ran into my car, Ear Muffs.

73
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,431
But... Your car...

74
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,256
The scratch will easily cost you
a couple of hundos.

75
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,397
- You want me to pay for it?
- Yes.

76
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,593
No worries, sir,
I can have the money tomorrow.

77
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,320
They really need to stop giving
delivery girls drive-ons.

78
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,750
I'm actually Assistant Coordinator
of Creature Upkeep.

79
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,519
Ahoy, matey.

80
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,790
It seems to be pirate day
once again, ya scurvy wench.

81
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,678
Arr!

82
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,878
Don't be late again, or Ava will
give you another peg leg.

83
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,710
- Okay.
- Okay.

84
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,393
Hey, <i>Catch a Predator,</i> what was that?

85
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,435
Well, that,
my fellow rebound artiste,

86
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,311
- was flirting.
- Gary, that was not flirting.

87
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,136
- No.
- What do you mean? I made extended

88
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,311
eye contact, picked up on some
personal information,

89
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,629
and then I negged her.

90
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,216
Don't tell me you're falling for this

91
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,630
like Neanderthal misogynistic
dating advice?

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,674
You're a modern man surfing
the sexual spectrum.

93
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,513
Just be cool and ask her out.

94
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,430
Or, I'm just spit-balling here,
you can ask her out for me.

95
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,119
This isn't high school.

96
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,875
Oh, sorry.

97
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,560
High school's a bit
of a trigger word for me.

98
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,876
Wow, you are really broken.
Okay, look, I will...

99
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,440
I'm not gonna ask her out,
but I will do some recon.

100
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,880
You'll be my time-bro wingman?

101
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,720
You do things like that and it makes
it very hard to help you, Gary.

102
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,835
All right, Legends, next stop,
New Orleans.

103
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,040
We have a fugitive serial killer
and it's a weird one.

104
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,631
It says here that all of the victims
were wealthy blonde ladies...

105
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,280
...stabbed to death
inside their locked bedrooms.

106
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,755
- Spooky.
- Wait, wait, wait.

107
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,231
Blondes killed in locked rooms...
That's the MO of Mike the Spike.

108
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,317
Am I gonna find a murder board
in your closet?

109
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,936
New Orleans is a crap town.

110
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,856
Although anything's better than
that tush tickler.

111
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
This?

112
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,517
Well, the cops pinned it on voodoo
priestess, Marie Laveau...

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,389
...one of the only women of color
with power living in 1856.

114
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,836
- Surprise, surprise.
- You stole my diary, weasel.

115
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,032
You mean the one that you knicked
from my trunk? That one?

116
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,636
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
I mustache you both to calm down.

117
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,672
Out of my way, otherwise I'll knock
that fur ball off your lip.

118
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,036
I confiscated the diary.
It's Time Bureau property now.

119
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,154
Don't worry, Rory, Garima will always
be right where she belongs.

120
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,316
In your imagination.

121
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,510
Garima.

122
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,636
Rory, look, I'm sorry,
Ava was just doing her job,

123
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,996
which is exactly
what the rest of us need to do.

124
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,993
Ray, Mick, we're going to protect
the fugitive's first victim,

125
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,560
Ms. Didi Charbonnet.

126
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,154
She's hosting a party this afternoon.

127
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,519
John, I need you to talk to Laveau.
Find out how she's mixed up in this.

128
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,672
I'll go with him.
Yeah, I love me some voodoo.

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,231
Great. Zari, you're on their mission.

130
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,834
You can just say the B-Team.

131
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,596
No, there's no...
There's no such thing as B-Team!

132
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,557
But there is such a thing
as an A-Team.

133
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,114
<i>Laissez les bon temps rouler!</i>

134
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,831
Wow, this doesn't even look
like America.

135
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,520
Oh, it's not. This is New Orleans, baby.

136
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,760
Have you been here before?

137
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,917
After London,
the best city in the world.

138
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,830
I mean, just look
at this hodgepodge of humanity.

139
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,875
It's a perfect place to
pick a face and just have some fun.

140
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,880
John.

141
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,279
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

142
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,794
It's just, uh...

143
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,156
This city just brings back memories,
is all.

144
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,832
<i>Monsieur</i> Constantine,
will you come with me, please.

145
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,351
Yeah, I'm not really not
in the habit of going home

146
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,830
with strangers, mate.
At least not recently.

147
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,115
Not again.

148
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,476
Oh, no.

149
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,596
This is not good.

150
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,079
Bloody New Orleans!

151
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,869
Priestess Laveau.

152
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,949
Cheers, love, you saved me
the trouble of finding you.

153
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,671
It was a little bit theatrical
to be honest with you,

154
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,117
but then again, I do appreciate
a flair for the dramatic.

155
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,874
You have something of mine.

156
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,275
Oh, I have no idea what you're on about.

157
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,672
I felt its presence as soon
as you arrived in New Orleans.

158
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,915
This medallion honors Saint Marron,
the patron saint of runaway slaves.

159
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,159
Now, what do you know about bondage,
<i>mon cher?</i>

160
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,592
Buy me a pint in the local pub
and I'll tell you all about it, love.

161
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,074
You don't have to say a thing.

162
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,116
I'm back, and it is time for me
to cook you a breakfast.

163
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,471
One full English, coming up.

164
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Hey, Johnny.

165
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,919
Des, you have to leave town.
This thing that's after me,

166
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,559
it's no ordinary demon.

167
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,478
This medallion has been in my family
for generations.

168
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,557
It's imbued with a protection spell.

169
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,476
Take it, Johnny.

170
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,712
As long as you promise to leave town.

171
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,116
It's just until I get this mess
sorted out, all right?

172
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,518
- All right.
- All right.

173
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,760
My great-great-grandson,

174
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,431
he must have loved you
to give you my medallion.

175
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,635
Did you love him?

176
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,875
Does anyone have eyes
on the fugitive's first victim?

177
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,720
<i>Annoying blonde
in the middle, that's Didi Charbonnet.</i>

178
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,437
Good. Stay with her.

179
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,056
<i>According to Gideon,</i>

180
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,656
<i>the murder's going to happen
within the hour.</i>

181
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,400
What kind of fugitive stabs a woman?

182
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,197
<i>I know a woman I can stab.</i>

183
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,840
<i>Rhymes with Shmava.</i>

184
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,636
Rory, play nice.

185
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,560
<i>Don't worry,
I can handle myself against the cretin.</i>

186
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,632
- <i>Whatever, man-pants.</i>
- Hey.

187
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,875
Look, I know you're mad at Ava
right now, but she's right,

188
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,156
the diary is not a toy.

189
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,396
Garima helped me write.

190
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,032
Would you just try to be nice to her,
please? For me?

191
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,201
<i>Guys, keep an eye on
the creepy ginger by the door.</i>

192
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,715
<i>Copy that.
And a possible fugitive alert.</i>

193
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,955
Gideon, we can't find John
and he's not on comms.

194
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,112
Mr. Constantine has refused
to wear his communications device.

195
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,316
Stupid blighter.

196
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,995
However, Captain Lance requested
I fabricate a tracker

197
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,713
in every pair of his undershorts.

198
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,559
- Cheeky little minx.
- Okay.

199
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,917
Great, as soon as you trace him,
send us his location.

200
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,952
Tell me what happened to my Desmond.

201
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,353
A demon, Neron...

202
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,038
Des was collateral damage.

203
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,871
Just go ahead and curse me,
'cause I bloody deserve it.

204
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,712
Why would I curse the man
who could save the last of my line?

205
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,509
You don't understand, Des is gone.

206
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,717
No amount of magic
can bring him back.

207
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,753
Save my kin.

208
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,470
Let him go!

209
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,439
Nice rescue, loves,
but Priestess Laveau and I

210
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,398
were just having a little chat,
weren't we?

211
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,880
Now, to our business.

212
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,917
Have you sensed any other magic
in your city

213
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,400
besides my own and theirs?

214
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,029
I've sensed a spirit. A Dybbuk.

215
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,599
And like you, from another time.

216
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,350
What's a Dybbuk?

217
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,272
It's a dislocated soul
of a dead person.

218
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,520
Someone so wicked that their spirit
never crossed over.

219
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,557
<i>Sara,
I don't think he's a fugitive.</i>

220
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,757
<i>I think this guy's
just looking for the bathroom.</i>

221
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,510
What's going on?

222
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,990
This doll...

223
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,918
He's going to kill my mama.

224
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,754
This doll?

225
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,034
Sara, is it possible that

226
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,157
<i>our fugitive killer
is a possessed doll?</i>

227
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,674
Horror movie 101.

228
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,311
Hello, dolly.

229
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,275
Wrong doll, you dick!

230
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,869
Well, we best be going then.

231
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,016
If we don't catch this Dybbuk,
then the good people of New Orleans

232
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,759
will blame you for its mayhem.

233
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,030
I believe

234
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,357
this belongs to you,
<i>Monsieur</i> Constantine.

235
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,710
Guys, this fugitive we're looking for
is an evil spirit.

236
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,952
Crap. Damn it, Ray,
where the hell are you?

237
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,996
Ray.

238
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
What happened?

239
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,274
Sara, any sign of the fugitive?

240
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,793
I think we may have
a Chucky situation here.

241
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,190
What does that mean?

242
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,640
I reckon the Dybbuk is in a doll.

243
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,991
<i>Rory, Ava, Sara needs backup.</i>

244
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,236
A word.

245
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,716
I'm all ears.

246
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,998
You still want your powers back?

247
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Come on then.

248
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,959
All right. Come on, big guy.

249
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,956
Sara, I had the weirdest dream.

250
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,912
I was attacked by a... Doll!

251
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,477
I'm gonna kill you, Goldilocks.

252
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,516
You're late.

253
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,991
It's still moving.
Kill it!

254
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,594
No, no, no. We need to question it.

255
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,240
Find out if it's
really Mike the Spike.

256
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,950
Who are you?

257
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,794
Your worst nightmare.

258
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,955
<i>Aloha,</i> I brought you some meat.

259
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,437
Oh, my cut. Um, I stupidly ran my bike
straight into this guy's car door.

260
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,992
No. No, he didn't look
before he opened the car door.

261
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,915
I know. I know.
I shouldn't have to pay,

262
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,919
but I don't want to lose
the world's best job.

263
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,952
You're a really good listener,
you know that?

264
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,830
What happened?

265
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,314
Did someone hurt you?

266
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,960
So how does helping you
make me a shapeshifter again?

267
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,077
Well, it's simple, really.
If I never meet Desmond,

268
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,079
then this demon scum that's after me
doesn't hurt him,

269
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,510
which means my guilt-ridden ass
never joins the Legends

270
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,080
and doesn't turn up to London
to give you a magical lobotomy.

271
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,469
Simple.

272
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,516
The me from five months ago
is having a drink in there,

273
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,116
and I'll recognize you as Amaya.
All you have to do is play the part.

274
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,239
American accent, stick up my bum
and in love with Nate.

275
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,711
Do me a favor, just make sure
I get out of there before I meet Des.

276
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,395
All right. I'll meet you back
at the Jumpship, John-O.

277
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,599
All right, Charlie-O.

278
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,070
Good luck.

279
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,877
- John? As I live and breathe.
- Amaya.

280
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,074
- Nice barnet, love.
- Thanks.

281
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,991
Last I heard, you were in Zambesi.
Where's Nate and the rest of the crew?

282
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,877
Nate, my boyfriend, and my crazy gang
of best friends.

283
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,558
- Oh, it is such a long story.
- Right

284
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,200
But a really good one.
How about I tell you all about it

285
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,154
- over a glass of Chardonnay?
- Chardonnay.

286
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,631
- Barkeep...
- No, no, not here.

287
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,396
I know a better place.

288
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,915
All right, well, you owe me dinner.

289
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,151
- That is a fair price.
- All right, got it.

290
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
Order up!

291
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,712
Hey, Mona!
How's life like in the Time Bureau?

292
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,632
Settling in? Dating anyone?

293
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,233
Good. Great. Yes, I mean,

294
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,229
there is someone.

295
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,630
Lay it on Nate.

296
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,519
I think it might be inappropriate
'cause I work here.

297
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,673
And he's here, too.

298
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,830
Wow!

299
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,036
Exactly.

300
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,555
I think I know who you're talking
about and trust me,

301
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,720
he has a crush on you, too.

302
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,871
- He does?
- Mm-hmm.

303
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,550
I swear, I was just imagining it.

304
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,395
We don't even, like, speak
the same language.

305
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,077
Well, he does have a unique way
of expressing himself.

306
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,432
I'm afraid people would think
it was weird. I mean, that hair...

307
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,520
Maybe he just needs
the right product.

308
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,920
What about the man meat?

309
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,317
Um, what about it?

310
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,954
I think he's, you know,

311
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,236
had some.

312
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,992
It wouldn't surprise me. I mean,
it's 2018. I don't judge.

313
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,193
I should probably forget about it.

314
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,033
No. <i>Carpe datum.</i>

315
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,033
- What have you got to lose?
- My job.

316
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,835
I will make sure you're not fired
for following your heart.

317
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,837
Okay. I'll do it.

318
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,273
I'm gonna let him know
how I feel.

319
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,176
One thing I learned
from the Chucky movies

320
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,795
is the doll always comes back.

321
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,520
Gideon, how's the timeline?

322
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,071
History is on track and Marie Laveau
lived a long and celebrated life,

323
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,834
inspiring an Emmy-nominated portrayal
by Angela Bassett.

324
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,149
See, Rory killed the Dybbuk.

325
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,560
Which is unfortunate because
now I have to explain to Mr. Heywood

326
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,479
why I'm bringing him a seared doll
instead of a magical creature.

327
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,876
Well, at least we get to find out
why they call it the Big Easy.

328
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,400
Did you happen to notice
that Rory robbed that party blind?

329
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,880
- I believe it.
- I don't understand

330
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,553
why you enable his bad behavior.

331
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,160
At the Bureau, we would fire
people for lesser offenses.

332
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,031
At the Bureau, you don't have to eat,
drink and sleep with your team.

333
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,272
Point taken. It's just that this is
supposed to be a professional

334
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,875
- operation, babe.
- Look, deep down, Rory's a good guy.

335
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,471
- And honestly, a friend.
- I get it.

336
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,271
- You run your team, I'll run mine.
- Thank you.

337
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,397
Speaking of, I should get back
to the Bureau.

338
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,756
How about you stay for dinner?

339
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,676
I could use a shower.

340
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,640
It's not like that thing's
going anywhere.

341
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,556
So, when are these changes to history
going to set in?

342
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,080
'Cause now I've got some big plans.

343
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,719
I'm actually thinking of Vegas first.

344
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,550
Time takes a moment to cement,
or so I'm told enough by Sara.

345
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,230
But, don't worry, love, we'll have
you shapeshifting again in no time.

346
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,759
John-O, you all good?

347
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,576
We stopped me from meeting Des
tonight, but now, I meet him

348
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,910
a few days later instead.
We have to go back.

349
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,096
I'm afraid
returning to New Orleans

350
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,474
is impossible, Mr. Constantine.

351
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,755
And why is that?

352
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,472
<i>Because I know
you two are up to something.</i>

353
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,391
<i>And as much as I hate babysitting,
I hate being played even more.</i>

354
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,600
<i>Gideon, bring them back
to the</i> Waverider.

355
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,677
<i>They have some serious explaining
to do.</i>

356
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,400
There's one thing
you need to understand,

357
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,469
is that I don't go in for all
that love crap.

358
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,155
Romance is for little girls,
crying into their pillows,

359
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,596
not for a devious tosser like me
who knows the score.

360
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,071
Then six months ago, I met him.

361
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
Desmond.

362
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,594
Our first night was like
a second liner marched

363
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,479
into my useless heart and breathed
some life into it again.

364
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,954
Desmond knew who I was,
exactly what I had done,

365
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,760
and he didn't care. So I was all-in,
rented an apartment.

366
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,720
And then, this demon shows up.

367
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,916
Neron.

368
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,797
Wanted me to help him usurp
the triumvirate ruling hell.

369
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,976
Well, he must have had something
on you to expect that.

370
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,480
The deed to my soul.

371
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,430
When I die, the bastard owns me.

372
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,676
And he's already worked out lots
of excruciating torments

373
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,479
for yours truly in the inferno.

374
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,997
So, naturally,
I told Neron to piss off.

375
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
Naturally.

376
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,235
I begged Des to run.

377
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,072
I knew that Neron would use him
against me.

378
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,510
Johnny!

379
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,714
The bloody fool didn't listen.

380
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:51,076
Till Neron dragged Des to hell
because of me.

381
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,920
I didn't think there was a way
I could save him.

382
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,272
That's the thing about
time travel, right?

383
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,750
There's always a way.

384
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,355
I joined the Legends thinking I could
outrun my guilt,

385
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,233
but being back in New Orleans,
I realized,

386
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,798
I was just taking
the coward's way out.

387
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,000
So I had to save him.

388
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,071
So now that you know
what we were up to,

389
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,958
do you mind explaining
why it didn't work?

390
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,839
Some points in history are fixed.

391
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,356
Maybe John and Desmond
were supposed to meet.

392
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,230
Look, I'm sorry,

393
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,279
I'm going to do everything I can
to find a loophole to save Desmond

394
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,589
and keep history intact.

395
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
You do that, love.

396
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,875
I know, an unscheduled visit.

397
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,116
It's good to see you, too.

398
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,194
I brought you something.

399
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,389
O...

400
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,713
<i>O-Mona</i>

401
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,876
<i>ko'u inoa.</i>

402
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,315
Mo-na.

403
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,478
<i>O wai kou inoa.</i>

404
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,430
- Konane.
- Konane.

405
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,830
"Shining like the Moon."

406
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,674
That's a really pretty name.

407
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,870
Mona.

408
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,957
Yup. That's me.

409
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,516
"Run and hide"?

410
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,279
Is someone coming?

411
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,316
Mona.

412
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,711
Hello, is someone there?

413
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,393
Compelling story back there.

414
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,195
Still, you're hardly the kind of guy
to open up,

415
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,120
unless, of course, you were stalling.

416
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,550
Well, you see,

417
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,391
magic has rules just like time travel

418
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,194
and I just so happen to write
the book on breaking them.

419
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,190
So if meeting Desmond
is a fixed point in time,

420
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,954
then I need to go back to
after I met him, stop him

421
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,595
from falling for me.
That's how I save Desmond's life.

422
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,400
History be bloody damned.

423
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,790
You went all out.

424
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,311
- The hell is he doing here?
- Leaving.

425
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,555
Wait, wait, both of you.

426
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,713
Please, look.

427
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,913
I roasted a roast.

428
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,656
Technically, Captain, I fabricated...

429
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,796
Shut up, Gideon.

430
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,679
Ava.

431
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,032
You are my love.

432
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,599
And, Mick, you are my family.

433
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,473
And it would mean the world to me

434
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,758
if both of you would try
to get along.

435
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,070
Please.

436
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,673
So, I was thinking

437
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,756
maybe you two
could find some common ground.

438
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,629
For example, Ava, you love to read.

439
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,195
Mick, here, is an author.

440
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,834
Oh, that's something.

441
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,433
I would be shocked if his novel
wasn't sexist and derivative.

442
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,876
It is.

443
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,354
Okay. Well, Mick, you love to eat.

444
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,230
Ava is a fantastic baker,
she makes one mean snickerdoodle.

445
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,159
Fancy sugar cookies.

446
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,336
Snickerdoodles are actually
completely different.

447
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,760
It's a cream of tartar base, but...

448
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,876
Garbage cookies.

449
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,840
That's rich, coming from a man who's
so lacking in personal hygiene

450
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,833
that he had to resort to sleeping
with a three-breasted alien sex toy.

451
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,236
Well, at least, Garima isn't a clone.

452
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,560
Only I get to use the C word.

453
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,719
Too far, Mick, too far.

454
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,232
Why do you get to have
a fake girlfriend and I don't?

455
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,756
- Clone.
- Dick.

456
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,916
Hey.

457
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,998
- Any luck?
- I'm sorry, John,

458
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,317
sometimes with history
if you change one thing

459
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,312
it creates a whole domino effect.

460
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,392
- It's all right.
- Listen, I...

461
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,191
I get being tempted
to save someone you love.

462
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,354
The anger and frustration, it's...

463
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,630
John?

464
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,190
Yeah?

465
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,760
- Turn around.
- I'd rather not.

466
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,874
That is the last time I try that.

467
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,669
I thought you couldn't...

468
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,549
You know what, it doesn't matter.
Where is John?

469
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,176
The last time we did something
like this, we almost destroyed

470
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,237
- the entire world.
- All right. Okay. Enough.

471
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,034
How are you planning to find John?

472
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,795
Well, his tracker...
Which you told him about.

473
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,914
Yeah. Ol' John-O's changing
history commando.

474
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,595
You know, I understand why John's
being so colossally stupid,

475
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,194
but what's your excuse?

476
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,236
I'm dying.

477
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,635
What?

478
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,833
Look, every time that I shapeshift,
it's like I'm born all over again.

479
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,155
But stuck in this body
for the first time in centuries,

480
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,278
I'm getting older.
But if John saves Desmond,

481
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,680
then he never joins the Legends.

482
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,595
And I'm immortal again.

483
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,038
Let me get this straight,
you helped John risk a catastrophic

484
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,511
rupture to history,
because you're afraid of aging?

485
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:40,472
Okay, maybe John succeeds and you
go on your immortal merry way,

486
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,756
but if he fails,
I will personally make sure

487
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,431
you spend the rest of your short,
dreary human life

488
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,196
in the deepest, darkest prison cell
the Bureau has to offer.

489
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,556
Let's move.

490
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,630
Look, I'm sorry, this is my fault,

491
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,473
I shouldn't have forced it
on you and Mick.

492
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,840
He was just stating a fact, you know,
I am a clone.

493
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,876
Oh, it's okay.

494
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,320
Sometimes I just wish I could
be more like you and the Legends.

495
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,760
You know? Loosen up.

496
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,240
When did that happen?

497
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,030
What?

498
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,554
Oh, no, I'll get a broom.

499
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Ava, wait.

500
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,640
Are those tiny little footprints?

501
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,120
The Dybbuk is alive.

502
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,720
Okay, we shouldn't split up.
Classic horror movie mistake.

503
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,519
Well, we're not exactly helpless.

504
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,673
Fine, I'll go fix Gideon.

505
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,599
And I'm gonna go catch
a serial killer.

506
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,751
You are way too excited about this.

507
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,474
What the hell?

508
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,429
<i>John.</i>

509
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,360
How the bloody hell did you find me?

510
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,840
John, you have to stop this.

511
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,635
If Desmond isn't dragged to hell,
and you don't join the Legends,

512
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,896
the effects could be cataclysmic.

513
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,912
Neron didn't drag Des to hell.

514
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,836
<i>I did.</i>

515
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,896
- What do you mean?
- When I told Des to run,

516
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,435
he went behind my back,
made a deal to protect me.

517
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,799
In exchange for sparing my life,
Des had to bind his soul to Neron's.

518
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,914
I couldn't send Neron to hell
without sending Des down with him.

519
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,116
Johnny?

520
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,550
Johnny!

521
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,518
Johnny!

522
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,959
I killed the man I loved,
and for what,

523
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,872
to buy New Orleans
a little more time.

524
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,679
Neron needs souls to take over hell,

525
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,309
and mark my words, he's coming back
to Earth to get them.

526
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,509
John, we can help you.

527
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,195
Yes, spare the team bit, all right?
I work alone.

528
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,120
- You back already?
- Yeah.

529
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,796
Des, I'm back already.

530
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,236
Hey, Johnny.

531
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,550
Hey, Des.

532
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,958
I'm gonna get some clothes on.

533
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,316
It's dead.

534
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,776
The Dybbuk must have found
another vessel.

535
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,760
Is there another doll
on the ship somewhere, Rory?

536
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,870
What the hell was that?

537
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,116
Block the exit.

538
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,840
Okay, so whatever it is, it has tiny
little feet, so it's not that big.

539
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,511
You dumb blonde,
it's not size that matters,

540
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,638
it's how you use it.

541
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,480
Professor Stein!

542
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,472
No. It's Mikey, you dick!

543
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,556
Here.

544
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,276
- Thank you.
- Oh...

545
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,230
Where is he?

546
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,400
He really is Mike the Spike.

547
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,680
Stop!

548
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,677
- Where are you taking him?
- You.

549
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,434
I am the Assistant Coordinator
of Creature Upkeep.

550
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,269
It's my job to take care
of magical beings.

551
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,476
Not for long.

552
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,597
- Let him go!
- I'm warning you.

553
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,720
Konane, no!

554
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
No!

555
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,990
You have to go.

556
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,509
They'll kill you.

557
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,957
- You okay?
- Mike's up there.

558
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,715
- Mike the Spike?
- And he's found a new vessel.

559
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,917
- Much, much worse.
- Hold on.

560
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,037
What could be worse than a creepy
antebellum doll?

561
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,720
Where are the eggs? I thought
you said you were gonna cook?

562
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,235
Yeah, I changed my mind.

563
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,920
I'll finish getting dressed,
then we can go out to eat.

564
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,837
You know,
it's not about the breakfast, Des.

565
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,115
Hmm.

566
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,396
Okay. I see what you're doing.

567
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,278
You know what
your problem is, Johnny?

568
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,713
You don't think
you deserve to be happy.

569
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,474
Des, your feelings for me
are a bloody lie, all right?

570
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,552
See, I just wanted to get you
into my bed.

571
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,232
But I couldn't be bothered
to put the work in

572
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,713
so I used a love spell on you.

573
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
Is this a joke?

574
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,430
Afraid not, mate.

575
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,151
Hey, I really care about you.

576
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,960
If there's something going on
in your life, just be honest with me.

577
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,032
Yeah, do you know what,
this thing between us,

578
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,271
it isn't real, it never was,
it doesn't exist.

579
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,995
I put myself out there like this,
and you're playing games?

580
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
You should go.

581
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,119
Yeah, you're right. I should.

582
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,076
But this...

583
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,240
This thing between us,

584
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,158
this was real, Johnny.

585
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,155
Sara, do you read me?
John's done something awful.

586
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,795
He hasn't done anything yet.
I'm still stuck in this form.

587
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,590
Uh...

588
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,510
What's that?

589
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,915
Guys, guys, guys,
I have a real emergency here.

590
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Marty!

591
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,555
Die, you putz.

592
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,510
I hate puppets!

593
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,110
Suck my...

594
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,755
At last...

595
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,234
Oi, Z, check this out.

596
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,200
I got my powers back.

597
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,959
Don't be mad, I'm myself again.

598
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,992
Whoa!

599
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,710
Where's Zari?

600
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,190
Zari?

601
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,760
Oh, blimey!
