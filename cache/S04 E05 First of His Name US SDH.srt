1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,300
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

2
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,826
High Septon:
<i>May the Warrior</i>
<i>grant him courage</i>

3
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,995
and protect him
in these perilous times.

4
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,414
May the Smith
grant him strength

5
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,792
that he might bear
this heavy burden

6
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,585
And may the Crone,

7
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,296
she that knows
the fate of all men,

8
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,715
show him the path
he must walk

9
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,302
and guide him
through the dark places
that lie ahead.

10
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,347
In the light of the Seven,
I now proclaim Tommen

11
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,600
of the House Baratheon
First of His Name

12
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,186
King of the Andals
and the First Men

13
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,648
and Lord of
the Seven Kingdoms.

14
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,236
Long may he reign!

15
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,238
All:
Long may he reign!

16
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,699
( cheering )

17
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,083
Special day.

18
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,218
( crowd chatting )

19
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,729
Your Grace.

20
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,524
Your Grace.

21
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,675
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

22
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,193
Your Grace.

23
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,365
There he is.

24
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,450
Long may he reign.

25
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,369
Long may he reign.

26
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,458
He sits the throne
like he was born to it.

27
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:15,171
Yes. He wasn't,
though, was he?

28
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:16,798
No, he wasn't.

29
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,764
You still mourn
for Joffrey?

30
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,975
He was my husband.
My king.

31
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,185
He would have been
your nightmare.

32
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,274
Your Grace, I feel--

33
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,568
You knew exactly
what he was.

34
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,238
I did, too.

35
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,614
You never love
anything in the world

36
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,117
the way you love
your first child.

37
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,371
Doesn't matter
what they do.

38
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,668
And what he did,
it shocked me.

39
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,256
Do you think
I'm easily shocked?

40
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,674
No.

41
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:03,302
The things he did
shocked me.

42
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,561
He's only a boy.

43
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,022
A good boy.
A decent boy.

44
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,940
He always has been.

45
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:19,152
<i>Who was the last</i>
<i>decent king, I wonder?</i>

46
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,112
He could be the first man
who sits on that throne

47
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,865
in 50 years
to actually deserve it.

48
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,036
It would be some
consolation, wouldn't it?

49
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,997
For all the horror
that put him there.

50
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,421
He will need help...

51
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,758
if he's going
to rule well.

52
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,718
He has you.

53
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,387
A mother is not enough.

54
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,017
You're still interested
in being queen, I take it?

55
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,727
Oh.

56
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,812
After all
that's happened--

57
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,902
it sounds strange,
I know, but I am--

58
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,446
I haven't even given
any thought to it,

59
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,156
what comes next.

60
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,159
It would be a great
honor, of course.

61
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,788
But I will have to speak
to my father about it.

62
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,958
Yes, speak to
your father.

63
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,920
I'll speak to mine.

64
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:27,220
We may be faced with
an alarming number
of weddings soon.

65
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,638
( chuckles )

66
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,848
I won't even know
what to call you.

67
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,851
Sister?

68
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,688
Or Mother?

69
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,817
Hmm.

70
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,903
King Joffrey Baratheon
is dead.

71
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,198
Murdered at his
own wedding.

72
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,451
Barristan:<i> And we have</i>
<i>taken the Meereenese</i>
<i>navy, Your Grace.</i>

73
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,662
The Second Sons took
the Meereenese navy.

74
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,872
Who told you
to take the navy?

75
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,125
No one.

76
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,460
So why did you do it?

77
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,838
I heard
you liked ships.

78
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,135
How many ships?

79
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,469
93, Your Grace.

80
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,971
How many men
can they carry?

81
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,640
9,300,
not counting sailors.

82
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,600
Would that be enough
to take King's Landing?

83
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,561
The Lannisters have more.

84
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,021
Barristan:
<i>They've been fighting</i>
<i>Joffrey's wars for years.</i>

85
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,898
They're tired,
dispersed.

86
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,151
<i>And now their king</i>
<i>is dead.</i>

87
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,904
8,000 Unsullied,
2,000 Second Sons

88
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,574
<i>sailing into</i>
<i>Blackwater Bay</i>

89
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,326
<i>and storming the gates</i>
<i>without warning.</i>

90
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,748
It's hard to say.
It could be enough.

91
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,252
But we're not fighting
to make you queen
of King's Landing.

92
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,297
10,000 men
can't conquer Westeros.

93
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,007
The old houses
will flock to our queen

94
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,967
when she crosses
the Narrow Sea.

95
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,636
The old houses will
flock to whichever side
they think will win,

96
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,930
as they always have.

97
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,185
There's other news.

98
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,769
From Yunkai.

99
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,231
Without the Unsullied
to enforce your rule,

100
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,234
<i>the Wise Masters have</i>
<i>retaken control of the city.</i>

101
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,029
<i>They've reenslaved</i>
<i>the freedmen who</i>
<i>stayed behind</i>

102
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,573
and sworn to take
revenge against you.

103
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,659
And in Astapor,

104
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,454
the council you installed
to rule over the city

105
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,582
has been overthrown
by a butcher named Cleon

106
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,835
<i>who's declared himself</i>
<i>"His Imperial Majesty."</i>

107
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,756
Please leave me.

108
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,055
Not you, Jorah.

109
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,028
It appears my liberation
of Slaver's Bay

110
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,072
isn't going
quite as planned.

111
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,284
You could sail for Westeros

112
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,119
and leave it all behind.

113
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,955
A boy sits on
the Iron Throne.

114
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,708
A boy many believe
to be a bastard with
no right to it.

115
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,127
They've never been
more vulnerable.

116
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,506
You counseled me against
rashness once in Qarth.

117
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,050
I didn't listen.

118
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,261
That all worked out well.

119
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,471
( chuckles )

120
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,937
How can I rule
seven kingdoms

121
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,607
if I can't control
Slaver's Bay?

122
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,610
Why should anyone
trust me?

123
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,280
Why should anyone
follow me?

124
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,823
<i>You're a Targaryen.</i>

125
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,783
You're the Mother
of Dragons.

126
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,371
I need to be
more than that.

127
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:52,466
I will not let those
I have freed slide
back into chains.

128
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,552
I will not sail
for Westeros.

129
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,596
What, then?

130
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,474
I will do
what queens do.

131
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,730
I will rule.

132
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,933
Pull up your hood.

133
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,397
A memorable shade.

134
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,191
But how would
they know?

135
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:53,569
You know what kind
of stories poor men
enjoy the most?

136
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:56,822
Ones about rich girls
they'll never meet.

137
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,537
Is this the only way
into the Eyrie?

138
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,706
The mountains
are impassable.

139
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,291
If you want to get
to the Eyrie,

140
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,251
you need to go through
the Bloody Gate.

141
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,630
It doesn't matter how
large your army is,

142
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,508
if you attack this gate,
you do it on this road,

143
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,385
three men abreast

144
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,388
and get slaughtered
like goats.

145
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,224
The first
Lords of the Vale
didn't have much,

146
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,600
but they had
these mountains

147
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,644
and they knew
how to use them.

148
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,021
And the fortress
they built here has
never been overcome.

149
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,358
Not once in 1,000 years.

150
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,111
Know your strengths,
use them wisely,

151
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,572
and one man
can be worth 10,000.

152
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,413
Knight:
Who would pass
the Bloody Gate?

153
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,624
Lord Petyr Baelish
and his niece Alayne.

154
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,588
Stand to.

155
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,049
- Stand to!
- Stand to!

156
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,512
Welcome back,
Lord Baelish.

157
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,598
<i>( gate clanking )</i>

158
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,624
<i>( door opens )</i>

159
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,501
Uncle Petyr!

160
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,797
Littlefinger:
<i>My lord.</i>

161
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,763
Oh.

162
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:48,809
I have brought you
a gift.

163
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,982
Lord Baelish.

164
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,735
- My lady.
- Look what Uncle Petyr
brought me.

165
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,362
A beautiful gift
for a beautiful boy.

166
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,990
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.

167
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,825
My name is Al--

168
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,328
Oh, do take down
that hood, child.

169
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,413
Don't you think know
who you are?

170
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,208
<i>You think</i>
<i>I'd let my intended</i>

171
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,335
leave the Eyrie
on urgent business

172
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,795
without knowing
what that business was?

173
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:22,343
I let him go so he could
bring you here to me.

174
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,349
My flesh and blood.

175
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,186
It's wonderful
to meet you, Aunt Lysa.

176
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,313
You mustn't call me that
in front of anyone else.

177
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,564
Of course.
I understand.

178
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,274
No one can know
you're here.

179
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,527
It would put us in a very
precarious position.

180
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,986
I would never
say a thing.

181
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,489
The Lannisters
want to destroy us.

182
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,616
They've been
trying for years.

183
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,701
<i>Now they know</i>
<i>what it feels like.</i>

184
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,622
Mummy said they killed
your mother and they chopped
off your brother's head.

185
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,544
They did,
and my father's.

186
00:13:56,627 --> 00:14:00,381
They killed
my father, too,
with poison.

187
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,467
I wanted to make the little
Lannister baby man fly,

188
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,719
but Mother
said I couldn't.

189
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,638
Make him fly?

190
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,723
Through the Moon Door.

191
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,061
( giggles )

192
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,397
Lysa:
<i>And on top of</i>
<i>everything else,</i>

193
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,899
they made you marry
that filthy troll.

194
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,068
They did.
They made us both.

195
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,528
Lord Tyrion
didn't want to.

196
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,655
Lysa:
<i>I don't believe that</i>
<i>for a moment.</i>

197
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,782
Did he force himself
on you?

198
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:28,242
No.

199
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,994
- We never--
- Lysa:<i> Good.</i>

200
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,247
Robin, this is
your cousin Sansa.

201
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,416
But you're not to call
her Sansa in front of anyone

202
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,501
but Uncle Petyr and myself.
Do you understand?

203
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,921
Sansa, this is
my son Robin.

204
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,048
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Robin.

205
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,342
Robin, show Sansa
to her chamber.

206
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,761
Take the back stairs.

207
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:52,683
Go.
We'll speak soon.

208
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,444
What took you so long?

209
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,447
Arranging for
the ascension of
King Tommen I,

210
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,908
extricating Sansa,
getting her here alive.

211
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,829
She's here.
We've spent more than enough
time on her for one evening.

212
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,250
Let's get married tonight.

213
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,544
Ought we not...

214
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,464
inform the Lords
of the Vale about
the ceremony?

215
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,591
There's only one
Lord of the Vale.

216
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,426
The others can all hang.

217
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,012
Lurking and simpering
on the stairs like buzzards

218
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,307
the moment my husband
died, trying to get
their claws in me.

219
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,059
I do think that
we could wait until--

220
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,019
I'm done waiting, Petyr.

221
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,605
We had our wedding night
many years ago.

222
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,815
Or don't you remember?

223
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,318
Like it was yesterday.

224
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:48,781
What wife would do for you
the things I've done for you?

225
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,950
What wife would trust you
the way I've trusted you?

226
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,620
When you gave me
those drops

227
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,997
and told me to pour
them into Jon's wine,

228
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,749
my husband's wine--

229
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,960
when you told me
to write a letter to Cat

230
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,005
telling her it was
the Lannisters--

231
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,007
( moans )

232
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,519
The deed is done.

233
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,271
Faded into nothing.

234
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,316
Only speaking of it
can make it real.

235
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,363
Tonight it is, then.

236
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,365
( laughs )

237
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,536
Let me bathe and dress
for the occasion.

238
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:39,123
Once I'm presentable,
I'll call on the septon
immediately.

239
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,257
I'm warning you.

240
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,219
I'm going to scream
when my husband makes
love to me.

241
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,514
I'm going
to scream so loud,

242
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,892
they'll hear me clear
across the Narrow Sea.

243
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,605
<i>( Lysa screaming )</i>

244
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,402
<i>( grunting, moaning )</i>

245
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,573
<i>( screaming )</i>

246
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,619
<i>( moaning, screaming</i>
<i>continues )</i>

247
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,712
When will the wedding
take place in your mind?

248
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,714
As soon as
decency permits.

249
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:32,718
After we've allowed
Tommen the appropriate
time to mourn his brother

250
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,220
and Margaery
to mourn her husband.

251
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,765
- A fortnight?
- That seems reasonable.

252
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,143
No jugglers,
no jousting dwarves,

253
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,354
no 77-course meals.

254
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,609
And your wedding
to Loras?

255
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,361
Shortly after Tommen's.

256
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,614
- Shortly?
- A fortnight.

257
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,950
I know
you don't like them.

258
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,328
I didn't like
your husband.

259
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,663
Used to pat me
on the back a lot.

260
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,415
I didn't trust him.

261
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,292
We had that in common.

262
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:09,296
You don't need to make
formal alliances with
people you trust.

263
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,590
Then whom can we trust?

264
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,594
Ourselves alone.

265
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,932
The Tyrells

266
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,643
are our only
true rivals

267
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,478
in terms of resources

268
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,648
and we need them
on our side.

269
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,192
Robert wasn't
particularly rich.

270
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,153
Robert had me
funding him.

271
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,573
Wars swallow gold
like a pit in the earth.

272
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,785
I suppose that explains
why we did so well
in the last one.

273
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:44,081
Do you know how much gold
was mined in the Westerlands
this past year?

274
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,332
Haven't a clue.

275
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,084
Go on, your best guess.

276
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,837
Pounds, tons, ounces?

277
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,422
Doesn't matter.
The answer is the same.

278
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,842
That can't be.

279
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:58,011
Our last working mine
ran dry three years ago.

280
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,139
Then how do we
pay for anything?

281
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,517
The crown owes
the Iron Bank of Braavos

282
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,435
a tremendous amount
of money.

283
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,854
How much?

284
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,023
A tremendous amount.

285
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,361
There must be someone
at the Iron Bank

286
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,613
you can speak to,
come to some arrangement.

287
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,532
The Iron Bank
is the Iron Bank.

288
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,075
There is no someone.

289
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:22,536
Someone does work there.
It is comprised of people.

290
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,955
And a temple
is comprised of stones.

291
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,791
One stone crumbles
and another takes its place.

292
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:32,629
And the temple holds its form
for 1,000 years or more.

293
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,174
That's what
the Iron Bank is--
a temple.

294
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,595
We all live in its shadow
and almost none of us know it.

295
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,015
You can't run from them.
You can't cheat them.

296
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,767
You can't sway them
with excuses.

297
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,479
If you owe them money
and you don't want
to crumble yourself,

298
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,815
you pay it back.

299
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,692
Vesting the Tyrells
in the crown

300
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,652
will help a great deal
in this respect.

301
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:59,573
It's for the good
of the family,
I understand that.

302
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,078
I'm not sure
my brothers do.

303
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,586
I know you're building
a strong case against Tyrion.

304
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,631
<i>And as a mother,</i>
<i>that is your right.</i>

305
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:20,344
But as a judge,
I cannot discuss
the trial with you.

306
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,512
I respect that.

307
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,059
We don't need
to discuss it.

308
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,106
The Lannister legacy
is the only thing
that matters.

309
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,318
You've started wars
to protect this family.

310
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,612
Turned your back
on Jaime

311
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,740
for refusing
to contribute
to its future.

312
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,826
What does Tyrion deserve

313
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,663
for lighting
that future on fire?

314
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,508
Arya:
<i>Joffrey.</i>

315
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,760
Cersei.

316
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,720
Walder Frey.

317
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,973
Meryn Trant.

318
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,934
<i>Tywin Lannister.</i>

319
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,395
The Red Woman.

320
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,355
Beric Dondarrion.

321
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,441
<i>Thoros of Myr.</i>

322
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,485
<i>Ilyn Payne.</i>

323
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,278
The Mountain.

324
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,322
Would you shut up?

325
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,575
I can't sleep
until I say the names.

326
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:30,497
The names of every
fucking person in Westeros?

327
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,332
Only the ones
I'm going to kill.

328
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,750
( chuckles )

329
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,670
Hate's as good a thing
as any to keep a person going.

330
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,339
Better than most.

331
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,634
We come across my brother,

332
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,388
maybe we can both cross
a name off our list.

333
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,019
If he were here right now,
what would you do?

334
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,945
I'd tell him
to shut the fuck up

335
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,322
so I can get some sleep.

336
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:10,287
Go on,
get it over with,

337
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,706
your list of doomed men.

338
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,877
I'm almost done.

339
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,004
Only one name left.

340
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,715
Go on.

341
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,683
The Hound.

342
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,108
Thank you.

343
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,152
Your mother always
had a sweet tooth,
you know?

344
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,695
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

345
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,948
At suppertime,
she would go straight
for honey cakes,

346
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,575
candied almonds,
custard.

347
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,243
Anything sweet.

348
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,745
Eventually,
your grandfather

349
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,498
had to assign a septa
to watch her at meals.

350
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,084
Cat was the firstborn
daughter after all.

351
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,794
It was important
that she remain desirable

352
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,837
so Father could arrange
a good match for her

353
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,465
and she was starting
to get fat.

354
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,885
My mother fat?

355
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,056
She never let me
have my pudding

356
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,849
until I'd finished
all my proper food.

357
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,103
This is before
she married your father
and moved to the North.

358
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:20,023
By the time you were born,
your father's austerity
had become hers.

359
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,943
Marriage changes people.

360
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,489
I didn't mean
for you to stop.

361
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,699
Go on, enjoy them.

362
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,789
How do you like them?

363
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,749
They're delicious.

364
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,255
Where did you get the lemons?
You can't grow them up here.

365
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,132
Oh, gods, no.

366
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,968
Petyr had three crates
brought all the way
from King's Landing.

367
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,970
He knew you liked
lemon cakes.

368
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,680
He's so kind.

369
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,682
He really
cares for you.

370
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,309
Think where you'd
be without him.

371
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,062
In their clutches
and tried for murder.

372
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:03,150
Yes.
I'm very lucky.

373
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,651
He feels
responsible for you.

374
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,361
Oh, I know he does.
I'm so grateful.

375
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,405
Why?

376
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,032
Why does he feel
responsible for you?

377
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,910
Well, I'm half Tully.

378
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,830
- He loved
your family so much.
- Loved your mother.

379
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,456
- No.
- That's what you
wanted to say.

380
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,584
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.
He's married to you.

381
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,294
Your mother never
loved him. Never.

382
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,213
Cat always went straight
for the sweetest thing.

383
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,300
The most obvious thing.
Your Uncle Brandon.

384
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,344
Your handsome, arrogant,
cruel Uncle Brandon.

385
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,180
He almost killed Petyr
in a duel.

386
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:36,141
And your mother
loved him anyway.

387
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,603
And now Petyr is risking
his life to save you,

388
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,522
the daughter of a woman
who didn't love him

389
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,609
no more than those
whores in his brothels.

390
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,236
- Has he told
you about them?
- No.

391
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,281
He hasn't told you about
the vile things they do
with their bodies?

392
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,408
The vile things they let
him do with their bodies?

393
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,744
-<i> No, never.</i>
<i>- Are you pregnant?</i>

394
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:00,290
What? No, I told you.
Lord Tyrion and I never--

395
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,209
I wasn't asking
about Tyrion.

396
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,085
What have you let Petyr
do with your body?

397
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,880
- Aunt Lysa, no, I--
- Your young, pretty body.

398
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,507
- Nothing. I'm a virgin.
- Don't lie to me.

399
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,928
You're hurting me.

400
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,471
I'll know if you lie.

401
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,015
I'm a virgin,
I swear it.

402
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,892
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.

403
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,977
All he says
is that I'm stupid.

404
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,063
I'm a stupid little girl
with stupid dreams

405
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,856
who never learns
and I'm a terrible liar,

406
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,399
so I should always
tell the truth.

407
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,693
And I swear to you that
he has never touched me.

408
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,029
- Not once, not ever.
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

409
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,574
It's all right.

410
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,785
It will all
be all right.

411
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,203
You'll be a widow soon.

412
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,580
They'll execute that dwarf
for murdering the king

413
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,832
and you'll be free
to marry Robin.

414
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,918
You'll be the Lady
of the Vale.

415
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,587
Hmm.

416
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,637
( horse whinnies )

417
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,602
( grunting )

418
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,861
Didn't they teach you
how to ride a horse?

419
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,282
Yes, my lady,
when I was young.

420
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,409
There wasn't
much call for it with
Lord Tyrion, though.

421
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,036
He preferred litters.

422
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,622
Perhaps you should
have stayed with him.

423
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,964
It's not going to be
a pleasant journey for you.

424
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:34,467
It could take weeks
to get to the Wall,
depending on the weather.

425
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,219
That's a long way off.

426
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,306
Well, Lady Sansa's
brother's at Castle Black.

427
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,142
If I were her,
that's where I'd go.

428
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,436
Feel free to stop
at any point.

429
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,314
Never, my lady.
I'm your squire.

430
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,816
I've made it this far in
the world without a squire.

431
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,443
I don't see why
I need one now.

432
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,236
All knights have
squires, my lady.

433
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,821
<i>I'm not a knight.</i>

434
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,615
And I'm not
a slaver, either.
I don't own you.

435
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,659
I swore an oath,
my lady.

436
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,495
I am releasing you
from that oath.

437
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,709
That means
you could leave.

438
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,461
I know.

439
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,838
What do you think
will happen if you leave?

440
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,800
They'll say I wasn't
a very good squire.

441
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,845
( horse nickers )

442
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,264
( whinnies )

443
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,525
- The hell you doing?
- Practicing.

444
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,820
- What, ways to die?
- No one's going to kill me.

445
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,947
They will if you nance
around like that.

446
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,408
That's no way to fight.

447
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,536
It's not fighting.
It's water dancing.

448
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,454
Dancing?

449
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,706
Maybe you ought
to put on a dress.

450
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,419
Who taught you
that shite?

451
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,296
The greatest swordsman
who ever lived.

452
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:41,219
Syrio Forel, the First Sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.

453
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,595
Braavos.
( scoffs )

454
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,514
Greasy-haired little
bastard, I bet.

455
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:45,849
They all are.

456
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,434
What do you know
about anything?

457
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,561
I bet his hair is greasier
than Joffrey's cunt.

458
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,563
- It was not.
- Was? He dead?

459
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,772
- Yes.
- How?

460
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,315
- He was killed.
- Who by?

461
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,359
Meryn Trant.
That's why Ser Meryn--

462
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,278
Meryn Trant?

463
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:01,114
The greatest swordsman
who ever lived killed
by Meryn fucking Trant?

464
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,324
- He was outnumbered.
- Any boy whore with a sword

465
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,034
could beat three
Meryn Trants.

466
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,620
Syrio didn't have a sword.
Or armor. Just a stick.

467
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,039
The greatest swordsman
who ever lived didn't
have a sword?

468
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,292
( laughs )

469
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,377
All right.
You have a sword.

470
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,795
Let's see
what he taught you.

471
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:19,466
Go on, do it for
your Braavosi friend.

472
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,801
Dead like all the rest
of your friends.

473
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,430
( grunts )

474
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:36,691
Your friend's dead
and Meryn Trant's not

475
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:38,359
'cause Trant had armor

476
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,653
and a big fucking sword.

477
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,408
( scoffs )

478
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,504
<i>( bird calling )</i>

479
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,852
Your Grace.

480
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,897
Prince Oberyn.
Writing letters?

481
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,525
A poem, actually.

482
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,694
May I show you
the gardens?

483
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,864
I couldn't very well
refuse a royal escort.

484
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,908
No, you couldn't.

485
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,454
I didn't realize
you were a poet.

486
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,249
Not a very good one.

487
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,292
For your paramour?

488
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,545
For one of my daughters.

489
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,964
You have several,
don't you?

490
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,549
Eight.

491
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,008
Eight?

492
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,386
Eight daughters?

493
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,513
The fifth is difficult.

494
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,140
I named her after
my sister Elia.

495
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,725
Beautiful name.

496
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,519
Yes.

497
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,897
But I can't say it
without turning sad.

498
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,775
And after I turn sad,

499
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,735
I grow angry.

500
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,488
Perhaps that's why
she's difficult.

501
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,741
The gods love
their stupid jokes,
don't they?

502
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,244
Which joke is that?

503
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,663
You're a prince of Dorne.

504
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,582
A legendary fighter.

505
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,959
A brilliant man feared
throughout Westeros.

506
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,920
But you could not
save your sister.

507
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:24,132
I'm a Lannister.
Queen for 19 years.

508
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,676
Daughter of the most
powerful man alive.

509
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,304
But I could not
save my son.

510
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,931
What good is power

511
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,809
if you cannot protect
the ones you love?

512
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:36,519
We can avenge them.

513
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,814
Yes, we can avenge them.

514
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:43,443
You really believe
Tyrion murdered your son?

515
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,654
I know he did.

516
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,992
We will have
a trial and we will
learn the truth.

517
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,578
We'll have a trial,
anyway.

518
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:01,044
I haven't seen
my daughter in
over a year.

519
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,087
The last time I saw her,

520
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,507
she was swimming
with two of my girls
in the Water Gardens.

521
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,385
Laughing in the sun.

522
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,598
I want to believe that.

523
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:16,267
I want to believe
she's happy.

524
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,936
You have my word.

525
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,857
We don't hurt
little girls in Dorne.

526
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,985
Everywhere in the world,
they hurt little girls.

527
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,205
Would you bring her
a gift for me?

528
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,000
<i>I wasn't there</i>
<i>for her name day.</i>

529
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,419
I don't know when
I'll see her again.

530
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,672
Anything at all.

531
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:49,008
The best shipwrights
in King's Landing

532
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,219
have been working
on it for months.

533
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,722
Myrcella loves
the open water.

534
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:58,810
Oberyn:
<i>I will have it sailed</i>
<i>down to Sunspear for her.</i>

535
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,355
Please tell her...

536
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,943
her mother misses her
very much.

537
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,496
Podrick:
Oh, no, no, no.

538
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,540
No, no, no, no.

539
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,834
Hells.

540
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,005
Gods.

541
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,969
Did you remove the skin?

542
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,139
No, my lady.

543
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,766
Have you ever cooked
a rabbit before?

544
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,060
No, my lady.

545
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,981
Did you ever cook
anything for Lord Tyrion?

546
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,859
No, my lady.

547
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,569
That was the cooks.

548
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,572
( groans )

549
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,671
What are you doing?

550
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,798
I'm helping you
with your armor.

551
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,760
I've been removing
my own armor for quite some
time, thank you very much.

552
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,280
What exactly did you do
for Lord Tyrion?

553
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:37,950
I brought him his meals
and cleared his table
when he was finished.

554
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,286
I kept his clothing
and linens clean.

555
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:43,122
Carried his messages
and returned the replies.

556
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,834
Mostly I poured wine.

557
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,669
Oh.

558
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,630
Whilst in
Lord Tyrion's service,

559
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,966
did you ever do anything
remotely related to combat?

560
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,640
I killed a man.

561
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,853
Who?

562
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,772
A Kingsguard.

563
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,029
He tried to kill
Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.

564
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,868
How did you
kill a Kingsguard?

565
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,665
I pushed a spear
through the back
of his head.

566
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,595
Bloody ridiculous.

567
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,767
Help me with
these straps.

568
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:58,030
- ( woman whimpering )
- ( Rast laughing )

569
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,621
Rast: Hey.

570
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,666
Hey, get up.

571
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,711
- Get up.
- ( sobbing )

572
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,552
Man:
<i>That's it lad,</i>
<i>put it inside.</i>

573
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,762
<i>Get the fire going again.</i>
<i>We're all freezing.</i>

574
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,098
Aye. What we need
is a girl there.

575
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:26,517
I've got to
have a piss.

576
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,984
<i>( pigs grunting )</i>

577
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,737
<i>( women whimpering )</i>

578
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,407
Now keep quiet.

579
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,753
( rattles )

580
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,850
( lantern squeaking )

581
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,864
( coughs )

582
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,158
You need water.

583
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,868
It doesn't matter.

584
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,788
Of course it matters.

585
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:34,085
You mustn't let
anything stop you.

586
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,798
They already have
stopped me.

587
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,509
No.

588
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,888
You're not here.

589
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,854
You're far from here.

590
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,942
What does that mean?

591
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,820
<i>( crows cawing )</i>

592
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,242
At the hill.

593
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,828
A great weirwood tree.

594
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,582
You've seen it, too.

595
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:18,170
Meera and I,
even Hodor,

596
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,673
we're only here
to guide you.

597
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,470
He's waiting for you.

598
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,558
We have to find it.

599
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,978
You have to make it.

600
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,688
We will.

601
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:40,401
This-- this isn't
the end.

602
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,696
Not for you.

603
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:46,407
Not yet.

604
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,076
Meera:
<i>How...</i>

605
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,579
will we know
the end?

606
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,718
You'll know.

607
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,265
<i>( footsteps )</i>

608
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,733
Locke:
<i>Brothers.</i>

609
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,611
You do move quiet.

610
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,948
- How many?
- 11 men.

611
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,700
Most of them
already drunk.

612
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:33,537
No guards posted.
They don't seem to have
a care in the world.

613
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,540
We'll carve them up
like walnut pie.

614
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,293
Karl was a top paid
cutthroat in Flea Bottom.

615
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:41,295
I've seen what
he can do with a knife.

616
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:43,422
Have you seen what
I can do with a knife?

617
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,758
( chuckles )
Not yet.

618
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:51,597
There's a hut on
the west side of the keep.
We should steer clear of it.

619
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,932
Why?

620
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:56,060
They've got some hounds
chained up inside.

621
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,938
Closer we can get
without the dogs sniffing
us, the better.

622
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,817
New moon tonight.

623
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,613
( sighs )
Get some rest.

624
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,824
We move at sundown.

625
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,036
I've always liked
a girl with curls.

626
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,372
A touch of class.

627
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,833
You take
whatever's left.

628
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,629
Get her up.

629
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,007
Bran:
<i>Stop.</i>

630
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,634
<i>Stop.</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

631
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,970
Hodor:
<i>Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.</i>

632
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:34,640
Stop.
Stop!

633
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:38,269
- Hodor:<i> Hodor. Hodor.</i>
<i>- Bran: Stop!</i>

634
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,729
- Please.
-<i> Hodor.</i>

635
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,816
- Please, get off her!
- Hodor. Hodor.

636
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,443
Please!
Please, leave her alone!

637
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,240
Bran:
<i>Please, stop. Stop.</i>

638
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:54,660
-<i> What are you doing?</i>
<i>Leave her alone!</i>
<i>- Hodor. Hodor.</i>

639
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,162
-<i> No!</i>
<i>- Shh.</i>

640
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,248
- Shh, shh, shh.
- ( gasping )

641
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,876
- Shh.
- ( whimpering )

642
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,882
You've got pretty hair,
don't you?

643
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,845
Now what is a pretty little
highborn girl like you

644
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:15,848
doing out here in
the deep, dark woods, eh?

645
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:21,437
You left your daddy's
castle looking for trouble,
didn't you?

646
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,607
No dresses for you.

647
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,610
You like it rough,
don't you?

648
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,529
You like it in
the gutter, don't you?

649
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,824
If you let my sister go,
I can help you.

650
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,119
You can help me?

651
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,622
I can.

652
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,459
And how you
gonna do that?

653
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:49,924
I have the sight.
I can see things.

654
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,926
That's very helpful.

655
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,053
Things that haven't
happened yet.

656
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,892
What a fine thing.

657
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,855
A fine thing.

658
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,693
Have you seen
what I'm gonna do
to your sister?

659
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:16,408
Have you seen
what they're going
to do to your sister?

660
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,621
No.

661
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,084
Don't close your eyes.

662
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,008
I saw you die tonight.

663
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,429
I saw your body burn.

664
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:41,809
I saw the snow fall
and bury your bones.

665
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,439
Man:
<i>To arms!</i>

666
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,567
They're here,
the Night's Watch.

667
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,736
( men shouting )

668
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,452
( woman screaming )

669
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,010
( screams )

670
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,099
Rescue party
is here, lads.

671
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,517
Lady.

672
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,270
- Is Jon with you?
- Aye.

673
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,772
I'll take you to him.

674
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,819
You're Brandon Stark?

675
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,576
- ( gasps )
- Hodor. Hodor.

676
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,495
The little crippled lord.
We're going for a ride, boy.

677
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,039
Jon! Jon!

678
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:49,501
Keep talking
and I'll cut your
friends' throats.

679
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,588
Starting with the idiot.
Do you hear?

680
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,673
Do you hear?

681
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,521
Hodor:
<i>Hodor! Hodor!</i>

682
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,025
Hodor. Hodor.

683
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,902
Hodor. Hodor.

684
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,366
<i>Hodor. Hodor.</i>
<i>Hodor.</i>

685
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:29,666
( grunting )

686
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,605
( choking )

687
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,905
( neck cracks )

688
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,952
Hodor.

689
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,833
<i>Hodor, get his knife.</i>
<i>Cut me loose.</i>

690
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,919
-<i> Hodor, get his knife.</i>
<i>- Hodor.</i>

691
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,631
Cut me loose, Hodor.

692
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,849
Jojen and Meera,
free them.

693
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,434
<i>Go!</i>

694
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,978
-<i> ( swords clanking )</i>
<i>- ( men shouting )</i>

695
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,813
Jon.

696
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:44,741
Jon!

697
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:48,328
If he sees you,
he won't let you
go north.

698
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,248
- He's my brother.
- And wants to protect you.

699
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,126
<i>He'll take you back</i>
<i>to Castle Black.</i>

700
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,671
<i>You have to decide.</i>

701
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,798
Do you want to find
the three-eyed raven?

702
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,356
- Bran: Hodor.
- Hodor: Hodor.

703
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,484
We need to free Summer.

704
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,986
And we need to go.

705
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,494
- ( shouts )
- ( groans )

706
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,836
Lord Snow.

707
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,339
Are you bringing me
back for trial?

708
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:44,384
We had
a good thing here.

709
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,971
We were free men.

710
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,224
You'll never be free.

711
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,643
You'll never know
what that's like.

712
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:16,625
You learn how to fight
in a castle?

713
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,672
( groans )

714
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,882
Some old man
teach you how to stand,

715
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,300
how to parry?

716
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,927
( groans )

717
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,557
How to fight
with honor?

718
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,446
You know what's
wrong with honor?

719
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,448
( spits )

720
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,913
( grunts )

721
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,750
You.

722
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,637
( gurgling )

723
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,691
( panting )

724
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,743
Are you all right?

725
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,414
Come with me.

726
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,625
Come on.

727
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,465
( grunts )

728
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,477
We lost
four brothers?

729
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,479
Five.

730
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:06,360
What the seven hells
could do that to a man?

731
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,822
I count 10
dead mutineers.

732
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,909
Locke said there
were 11 of them.

733
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,995
Where's Rast?

734
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,665
<i>( wind howling )</i>

735
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,671
( panting )

736
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,399
<i>( crows cawing )</i>

737
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,741
- ( roaring )
- ( Rast screams )

738
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,667
- Here's another.
- Jon.

739
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,588
Jon:
<i>Where in seven hells?</i>

740
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,007
Come here.

741
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,722
( whining )

742
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,726
I missed you, boy.

743
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,481
What should we do
with this lot?

744
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,405
It's not safe for you
here on your own.

745
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:36,241
Mance Rayder has an army
heading this way

746
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,368
and there's worse out
there than Mance.

747
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:43,331
Come with us
to Castle Black.

748
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:46,752
We can find you work.
Keep you safe.

749
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:49,087
Meaning all respect,
Ser Crow,

750
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:52,883
Craster beat us
and worse.

751
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:56,052
Your brother crows
beat us and worse.

752
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,096
We'll find our own way.

753
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,973
You want to stay here

754
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,933
in Craster's Keep?

755
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:06,146
( spits )

756
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,106
Burn it to the ground

757
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,109
and all the dead with it.

758
00:51:52,609 --> 00:53:11,062
