1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:03,435
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:06,887
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:09,440
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:12,359
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:17,364
But to do so, I can't
be the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,366 --> 00:00:19,516
To honor
my friend's memory,

7
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:22,486
I must be someone else.

8
00:00:22,488 --> 00:00:26,691
I must be something else.

9
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:28,325
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:29,693
This one's no longer
of use to us.

11
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:31,495
Wait. He could
still be useful.

12
00:00:31,497 --> 00:00:33,914
She's right. Once we
get rid of his friends,

13
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,083
we'll need him to lead us
to the grave.

14
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:37,635
You're going back
to the island.

15
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,637
Look, you already
lost your dad.

16
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,373
Your mom, she's still here. And
I'm sure she'd love to see you.

17
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,225
I'm not going to that prison.

18
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:46,310
It's the only way
I know how to hurt her.

19
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:49,096
And I want to hate you.

20
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:51,382
But I can't.

21
00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:54,802
I didn't think that there were
secrets kept between us.

22
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:57,721
Mom...what
are you hiding?

23
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:02,943
My name
is Moira Dearden Queen.

24
00:01:02,945 --> 00:01:06,781
I am the acting CEO
of Queen Consolidated.

25
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:10,251
And, God forgive me,
I have failed this city.

26
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:13,454
I have been complicit
in an undertaking

27
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:16,040
with one horrible purpose--

28
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:22,463
to destroy the Glades
and everyone in it.

29
00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:24,515
If you reside in the Glades,

30
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:27,134
please, you need
to get out now.

31
00:01:27,136 --> 00:01:30,304
Your lives and the lives
of your children depend on it.

32
00:01:30,306 --> 00:01:32,556
Please.

33
00:01:32,558 --> 00:01:36,193
Warden says we got
to evacuate.

34
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:38,595
Help me get these out of here.

35
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:41,431
What about the inmates?
Leave 'em.

36
00:02:17,936 --> 00:02:20,271
Huh?

37
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:25,276
Hmm.

38
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:30,314
Ahh.

39
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,582
Over here, let me out.
No.

40
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,618
Give me the keys!
No, no, too violent.

41
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,705
Take me!
Sloppy, too stupid.

42
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:40,925
Too...ambitious.

43
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,260
You.

44
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:45,212
I love your work.

45
00:02:45,214 --> 00:02:47,264
Big future.

46
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:48,632
Hey, be careful.

47
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:51,001
There's liable
to be aftershocks.

48
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:53,554
Oh, I'm counting on it.

49
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:16,124

51
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,874
Mr. Queen, what are
your mother's chances?

52
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:34,094
Is she on suicide watch?

53
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:36,179
Mr. Queen, can you
give us any comment?

54
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:38,482
It's not fair.
They're not the ones on trial.

55
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:41,601
That won't stop Jean Loring from using
them as props to drum up sympathy.

56
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:43,487
You don't seem
overly concerned.

57
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,406
She confessed to being an accomplice
on live television.

58
00:03:46,408 --> 00:03:48,825
Also sad that
Malcolm Merlyn coerced here.

59
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:52,779
You have something, don't you?

60
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:55,248
I thought I was
your co-counsel, Adam.

61
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,240
If you're holding a trump card,

62
00:03:56,265 --> 00:03:57,869
don't you think maybe
you should share it with me?

63
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,920
It's going to be
a good trial.

64
00:03:59,922 --> 00:04:03,206
Come on,
let's get inside.

65
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:13,383
You don't
have to do this.

66
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:15,135
Ivo says we do.

67
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:16,586
Your friends are
a danger to his men.

68
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:18,221
Go. Quick and quiet.

69
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:20,056
Slade! Shado! Run!

70
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:34,871
There's no one here.

71
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,826
They must have moved on
from their position.

72
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:41,628
Chargers are placed.
Here's the detonator.

73
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,280
Make sure they have
no place to return to.

74
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:46,249
Go.

75
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:49,135
And you.

76
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:50,921
Now you're going to take us
to the graves.

77
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,256
Let's go. Get him up.

78
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,761
Let's get clear.

79
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,849
Did you find
the detonator?

80
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:04,968
Yes.

81
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:08,572
We were lucky.

82
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:12,025
I was lucky.
You were good.

83
00:05:12,027 --> 00:05:13,944
Either way...

84
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,645
They have Oliver.

85
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,031
I'm going after him.

86
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:20,149
Not alone.

87
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:23,036
You can barely walk.

88
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:25,288
All the more
reason not to stay here.

89
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,625
Give them another chance
at blowing me up.

90
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:35,932
Are you two ok?

91
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:37,767
I should be asking
you that question.

92
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:38,852
I'll be fine.

93
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:40,887
You look like
you have the flu.

94
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,939
If that's true, I shouldn't have
wasted my time getting vaccinated.

95
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:45,308
Diggle, whatever
it is, just go home.

96
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,561
Oliver, listen,
I can take care of things.

97
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:49,613
No, we'll be fine,
all right?

98
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,531
Go rest. And don't
make me call a cop.

99
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:55,018
There are a few
of them around here.

100
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:23,046
...have been complicit
in an undertaking

101
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:25,815
with one horrible purpose--

102
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:30,103
to destroy the Glades
and everyone in it.

103
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:32,572
And it worked.
The Glades were destroyed.

104
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:34,808
Homes and lives
were lost.

105
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,943
All because
of her actions.

106
00:06:36,945 --> 00:06:39,412
True, she had second thoughts;
Remorse which

107
00:06:39,414 --> 00:06:42,349
compelled her
to deliver this statement.

108
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:44,534
But on behalf
of the 503 lives

109
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:46,870
that were
extinguished that day,

110
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:50,490
I say, Moira Queen,
your remorse comes too late.

111
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:52,709
For the last five years,

112
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:54,844
under the threat
for my life

113
00:06:54,846 --> 00:06:56,546
and the lives
of my family...

114
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:59,516
Why wouldn't those
threats silence her?

115
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:02,802
Why wouldn't
Moira Queen be terrified?

116
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:05,522
Malcolm Merlyn killed
her first husband,

117
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:06,424
abducted her second.

118
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:08,328
Why wouldn't she be
in fear for her life?

119
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,478
For the lives
of her children?

120
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,030
What would you do?

121
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:16,066
If it were your children
in the crosshairs

122
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,401
of a mad man's rage?

123
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:24,124
S.T.A.R. Lab's
particle accelerator

124
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:26,459
will be turned on
right on schedule.

125
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:28,328
In other news,
we have just received word

126
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,914
that both sides have now completed
their opening statements

127
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,049
in the Moira Queen trial.

128
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:34,968
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you look disgusting.

129
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,970
Yeah, well, I don't
feel great, Felicity.

130
00:07:36,972 --> 00:07:39,889
Is there a right way
to take that?

131
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:41,341
You should go home.

132
00:07:41,343 --> 00:07:43,343
I am going.

133
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:45,962
I just need to make arrangements
for a replacement bodyguard.

134
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:48,815
Did you get the flu shot?
Personally, I never do.

135
00:07:48,817 --> 00:07:51,935
I know that I should.
I just, I have this thing about needles.

136
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:53,737
All pointy things,
really.

137
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,822
Which is ironic, considering
who we work with.

138
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:58,074
Yeah, it's not the flu,
Felicity, it's more like...

139
00:07:58,076 --> 00:08:00,527
Dig!

140
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:03,697
Hello?

141
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:05,999
Are you here?

142
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:08,952
Here...there...

143
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:11,037
everywhere.

144
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,789
So.

145
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,125
How goes our little
science project?

146
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,326
Working like
you said it would.

147
00:08:17,328 --> 00:08:19,295
How wonderful.

148
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:21,164
Ah, so listen.

149
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,300
Doing the thing was 50,000.

150
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:26,302
Keeping quiet about it,

151
00:08:26,304 --> 00:08:28,504
I'm thinking
it should be 50 more.

152
00:08:28,506 --> 00:08:29,889
Hmm.

153
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:32,058
Oh, I want word
to spread.

154
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,311
It's kind of the whole
objective, actually.

155
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:38,114
You see my point?

156
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:43,953
You should know,
I find post hoc negotiation...

157
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:46,189
distasteful.

158
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:47,991
Ahh.

159
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,826
Such a shame
you won't get to see

160
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:52,212
what your works have
wrought, doctor.

161
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:55,749
But soon,
everyone else will.

162
00:08:55,751 --> 00:09:00,420
And they'll beg for it to end.

163
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:11,252
What the hell
are you doing here?

164
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:12,241
I heard you
passed out.

165
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:13,825
I told Felicity
not to call you.

166
00:09:13,827 --> 00:09:15,327
Yeah, but before that,
you said "gaw" and "thud,"

167
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:17,045
so I didn't take it
very seriously.

168
00:09:17,047 --> 00:09:19,214
She was right to call me. Diggle,
you need medical attention.

169
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:21,500
He needs more than that.
When Dig passed out,

170
00:09:21,502 --> 00:09:23,335
I sent a sample of his blood
to a chemist I know at QC.

171
00:09:23,337 --> 00:09:25,670
The guy owes me a favor.
Long story, I fixed his parking ticket.

172
00:09:25,672 --> 00:09:27,722
Huh. I guess it's not that long.

173
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:30,559
Felicity.
The blood sample.

174
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:33,562
Yeah. It came back positive--
for trace amounts of Vertigo.

175
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:34,679
I never used Vertigo
before in my life.

176
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:36,481
You were exposed
to it somehow.

177
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:37,966
Vertigo's
in play again?

178
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:39,651
When the Count recovered

179
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:41,253
from his OD on Vertigo,
he was sent to Iron Heights.

180
00:09:41,255 --> 00:09:44,022
That got hit
in the quake.

181
00:09:44,024 --> 00:09:46,474
He got out the same way
the Doll Maker did?

182
00:09:46,476 --> 00:09:49,277
And just like
with the Doll Maker,

183
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,481
prison officials worked overtime
to keep the lid on the escape.

184
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:58,319
I know what you're thinking.
No, you don't.

185
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:00,705
I made a choice not to put
an arrow in this guy.

186
00:10:00,707 --> 00:10:03,508
And it was
the right choice.

187
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,344
There's no more
killing.

188
00:10:06,346 --> 00:10:08,663
I worked this up to counteract
the effects of Vertigo.

189
00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:09,848
Give it to Diggle. I...

190
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,050
I need to get back
to court.

191
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:14,168
While I'm gone,
just work up whatever you can

192
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,305
and figure out how Diggle got Vertigo
in his system without his knowledge.

193
00:10:17,607 --> 00:10:19,974
Ok. Go.

194
00:10:22,011 --> 00:10:25,897
When was the first time you heard
about this so-called Undertaking?

195
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:27,954
When everyone else did,

196
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:30,122
when my mother gave
the press conference.

197
00:10:30,287 --> 00:10:32,086
Doesn't seem like
you took it too well.

198
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:33,638
I was surprised.

199
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,041
Who wouldn't be?

200
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:42,714
Uh, your mother was, um,
immediately take into custody,

201
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:45,433
but I assume you went down
to the precinct to see her?

202
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:48,669
Um, actually I didn't see her
until she was moved.

203
00:10:48,671 --> 00:10:50,555
To the prison.

204
00:10:50,557 --> 00:10:53,508
Do you remember when
you visited her?

205
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,809
Uh, not the exact date.

206
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:58,796
It's ok, I have
the visitor log here.

207
00:10:58,798 --> 00:11:00,348
October ninth.

208
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,617
Five months later.

209
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:04,352
Why so long?

210
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:07,355
Um, I--I...

211
00:11:07,357 --> 00:11:09,824
Are you ok?

212
00:11:11,026 --> 00:11:12,794
An answer, please.

213
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:15,380
Why did it take you
five months to visit your mother?

214
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:17,482
Your Honor, if I--
No.

215
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:19,751
I want to hear this.

216
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:21,336
I needed time.

217
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:22,954
I was...

218
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:25,757
Angry. So angry, perhaps,

219
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,210
that it took you
five months to forgive her?

220
00:11:29,212 --> 00:11:30,929
It was complicated.

221
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:33,648
No. It's very simple.

222
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,218
You blamed your mother
for what she had done.

223
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,854
So why shouldn't the jury?

224
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:44,776
Your Honor, we have
no further questions

225
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:47,395
for the...witness.

226
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:53,284
Adam!

227
00:11:58,874 --> 00:12:01,426
Where is it?

228
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:04,178
Come on,
where is it?!

229
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:07,632
The Hosen, where is it?

230
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:08,967
What?

231
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:10,468
The arrowhead.

232
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,637
Every report said it was
with these bodies.

233
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,055
You said you
and your friends were here.

234
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:16,941
Now, where is it?

235
00:12:16,943 --> 00:12:19,360
Take him outside.

236
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:22,981
Make him show you
where his friends are hiding.

237
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:28,870
Take us to them.

238
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:31,873
I don't know
where they are!

239
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,124
Oww!

240
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:34,993
Tell me,
or you lose your hand.

241
00:12:34,995 --> 00:12:36,878
Let us suggest
another option.

242
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,781
You hand the kid over to us,
and we don't kill you all.

243
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:53,144
Hey, are you ok?

244
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:57,348
Don't worry about me.
I can take it.

245
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:17,835
Was that as bad
as it seemed?

246
00:13:17,837 --> 00:13:20,455
Thea's testimony?
It was a set-back.

247
00:13:20,457 --> 00:13:22,790
We were counting on her to--

248
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:24,175
Humanize me.

249
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:25,927
Frankly, yes.

250
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:27,962
And now we're going to have
to go another way.

251
00:13:27,964 --> 00:13:30,298
No. No, I told you,
I won't testify.

252
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,333
I know you did.
But now you have to.

253
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:35,436
She's right, Mom.

254
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:38,139
Jean, can you
give us a minute?

255
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:39,807
Yeah.

256
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:45,563
I know what
you're going to say.

257
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:48,983
But if I testify,
it will destroy our family.

258
00:13:48,985 --> 00:13:52,537
And if your lawyer's right,
you don't have a choice.

259
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:55,323
Mom, secrets are what
put you in this situation.

260
00:13:55,325 --> 00:13:58,576
Secrets and lies.

261
00:13:59,828 --> 00:14:02,280
And now it is time

262
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:04,982
to give the truth its day.

263
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:08,836
Now, I don't want us
to lose sight

264
00:14:08,838 --> 00:14:10,972
of the other major
event in court today.

265
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:13,591
Was there any indication
of Adam Donner being ill?

266
00:14:13,593 --> 00:14:16,744
No, there was very little
warning before Mr. Donner

267
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:17,730
collapsed to the ground.

268
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,681
I've spoken to several people that were
in the courtroom with me...

269
00:14:20,683 --> 00:14:23,601
How are you feeling?

270
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:24,986
Fine.

271
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:26,437
You have a lousy
poker face, Diggle.

272
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:28,239
Did he take the antidote?

273
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:30,408
Didn't work. The Count
must have futzed with his recipe.

274
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,859
Heard what happened
with Donner

275
00:14:31,861 --> 00:14:33,661
at the court,
and with Thea.

276
00:14:33,663 --> 00:14:35,396
How is she?

277
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:37,231
Going to be fine.

278
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:39,900
Your poker face isn't much better
than mine, Oliver.

279
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,505
Hello, Starling City.
Felicity!

280
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:47,008
Miss me?

281
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,677
Many of you have noticed that you're
not feeling quite like yourselves...

282
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,629
He's taken over
all the local station feeds.

283
00:14:51,631 --> 00:14:53,548
Track his signal.

284
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,383
Like our good assistant
district attorney here.

285
00:14:55,385 --> 00:14:56,934
You might recognize him
from his work

286
00:14:56,936 --> 00:14:59,554
in the ongoing
Moira Queen trial.

287
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:02,223
Hi, Adam.
What do you want?

288
00:15:02,225 --> 00:15:04,225
I want what you want.

289
00:15:04,227 --> 00:15:06,427
For you to feel better.

290
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:09,230
Go to hell!

291
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:11,732
I do think you want
the pain to end,

292
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:13,901
and I can do that...

293
00:15:13,903 --> 00:15:16,037
With Vertigo.

294
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:19,624
It's what all of
your bodies crave.

295
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:22,860
Fortunately, the power
of relief is right here.

296
00:15:22,862 --> 00:15:24,662
And all you have
to do is go to your friendly

297
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:27,298
neighborhood Vertigo
dealer and request the cure.

298
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,550
Simply supply
and demand at work.

299
00:15:29,552 --> 00:15:32,670
Now, tell me
you want this

300
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:34,889
and it's yours.

301
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:39,093
All the pain will
just...disappear.

302
00:15:40,512 --> 00:15:42,597
Say it.

303
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:44,565
Say...

304
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:45,733
You want it.

305
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:53,140
I-I--want--I want it.

306
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:02,950
You see...a simple solution.

307
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:05,036
I'm Count Vertigo,

308
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:07,821
and I approve this high.

309
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:13,044
What do we do now?

310
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:15,296
We find him...

311
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:18,499
And we shut him down.

312
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:27,911
Where did he
broadcast from?

313
00:16:27,912 --> 00:16:30,079
He bounced the signal off
of S.T.A.R. Lab's satellite.

314
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:31,797
He could have sent that
transmission from Markovia.

315
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,332
He would want
to stay local.

316
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:35,217
Scrub the footage,
frame by frame if you have to.

317
00:16:35,219 --> 00:16:37,753
There's something
on here that gives us a clue

318
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:39,388
to where he is.
If he dosed the whole city,

319
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,056
why are only some people
showing symptoms?

320
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:42,675
Maybe exposure
was selective.

321
00:16:42,677 --> 00:16:44,476
The Count contaminated
something that only certain people,

322
00:16:44,478 --> 00:16:46,679
like you and Donner,
consumed.

323
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:50,566
A most dramatic turn.

324
00:16:50,568 --> 00:16:52,685
City officials are urging calm,

325
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:54,803
hoping to avoid
widespread panic.

326
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,488
Deputy Mayor Levitz has...

327
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,192
The Count has turned
Starling into a city of junkies.

328
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:02,778
Any leads on where
he's holding ADA Donner?

329
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,299
Hmm, no. As cold as it sounds,
I've got other concerns.

330
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:08,617
Laurel?

331
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,369
Adam's trial notes
are very thorough.

332
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:12,705
They better be.
You're lead counsel now.

333
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:15,174
Ms. Spencer,
you're the district attorney.

334
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:18,594
Yes, but you're the one
that the jury knows.

335
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:24,433
You'll do fine, Laurel.

336
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:26,735
I know.

337
00:17:26,737 --> 00:17:29,605
I just found
Adam's trump card.

338
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:37,112
♪ Sneaking cigarettes
at lunchtime ♪

339
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:40,983
♪ sun feels safe

340
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:43,752
Sorry, I didn't hear you walk up.

341
00:17:43,754 --> 00:17:45,820
I just want to be
left alone.

342
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:47,923
Well, too bad that's not
an option for you.

343
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:49,958
But maybe I know
something that is.

344
00:17:55,298 --> 00:17:57,299
Hit me.

345
00:17:57,301 --> 00:17:58,884
What?

346
00:18:01,638 --> 00:18:03,555
You wonder why I used
to go out at night

347
00:18:03,557 --> 00:18:05,807
looking to throw down
with bad guys.

348
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:08,643
Part of it was to help the city.

349
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:10,929
And the other part

350
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:13,231
was to help me.

351
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:15,984
Getting tuned up
by street thugs helped you?

352
00:18:15,986 --> 00:18:18,853
Yeah, well, I gave
as good as I got.

353
00:18:18,855 --> 00:18:21,373
There we go.

354
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,993
When I would throw a punch,
I'd be so angry.

355
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:27,813
I'd feel this heat
rising inside of me,

356
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,449
in my jaw. In my chest.

357
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:32,617
And my fists.

358
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:37,506
But I needed
somewhere to go.

359
00:18:37,508 --> 00:18:40,008
Come on.

360
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:47,215
Thea, you're angry.

361
00:18:47,217 --> 00:18:50,352
At your mother, the D.A.,
yourself, maybe.

362
00:18:50,354 --> 00:18:51,837
But that anger is going
to chew up your insides

363
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,555
if you don't
let it out.

364
00:18:53,557 --> 00:18:56,108
I'm not going to hit you, Roy.

365
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,826
Try.

366
00:18:57,828 --> 00:19:00,228
Try!

367
00:19:01,914 --> 00:19:05,117
I said hit me, right? 'Cause
that felt like--

368
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,920
that didn't really
feel like anything.

369
00:19:08,922 --> 00:19:12,040
Better. But keep
your wrists straight.

370
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:13,291
Don't just use your arm.

371
00:19:13,293 --> 00:19:15,343
Put your entire body
into it.

372
00:19:17,296 --> 00:19:20,081
Come on, again.

373
00:19:42,371 --> 00:19:44,823
At least let me
call Lyla.

374
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,658
All she could do
is worry about me.

375
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,160
I found something.

376
00:19:48,162 --> 00:19:49,494
I don't see anything.

377
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:53,165
Because you have
to see what Donner does.

378
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:55,167
His eye caught
a reflection.

379
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:56,551
Can you enhance?

380
00:19:56,553 --> 00:19:59,421
It hurts me that you
feel a need to ask.

381
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:01,640
What are those,
wings?

382
00:20:01,642 --> 00:20:03,058
It's the city seal.

383
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,559
Starling Municipal
Records department.

384
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:06,127
That building's
been abandoned

385
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:07,762
since the city went to digital.
Dollars to donuts,

386
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:09,681
that's where 
is operating out of.

387
00:20:09,683 --> 00:20:11,900
Not for long.

388
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:21,409
You shouldn't be here.

389
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:23,078
My attorney needs...
Moira.

390
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,731
I know I could be disbarred
for speaking with you,

391
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:28,984
but this isn't something
for lawyers.

392
00:20:28,986 --> 00:20:31,819
This is a family matter.

393
00:20:41,013 --> 00:20:44,966
Jean told me she's calling you
to the stand tomorrow.

394
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,771
Yes.

395
00:20:49,773 --> 00:20:51,840
You can't testify.

396
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:55,393
Well.

397
00:20:55,395 --> 00:20:57,712
The fact that you don't want
me to, Laurel,

398
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,531
is a good indication
that I should.

399
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:02,200
If you take the stand,
I'll have to cross examine you,

400
00:21:02,202 --> 00:21:04,219
and I'll have to do it
to the best of my ability.

401
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,155
Yes, I understand.
No, I don't think you do.

402
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:22,721
Forget about what
this will do to Oliver and Thea.

403
00:21:22,723 --> 00:21:26,141
It also could undermine
your entire case.

404
00:21:26,143 --> 00:21:30,145
So, Moira, please.

405
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:31,763
Please.

406
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:33,548
Don't make me use this.

407
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:37,736
Everything is at stake for you.

408
00:21:37,738 --> 00:21:40,038
And I don't want
to be the one to take it all away.

409
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:46,111
Faster, please.

410
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:49,897
Faster! We have a city
full of customers.

411
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:52,450
And I mean this literally.

412
00:21:52,452 --> 00:21:55,420
I'm afraid my production apparatus
is a little over-taxed

413
00:21:55,422 --> 00:21:58,206
with the increased demand.
I can live with it, though.

414
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,842
I can't say
the city can.

415
00:22:02,244 --> 00:22:04,179
Go.

416
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:06,548
Be still, my heart.

417
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:19,277
Step away from them.

418
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,447
Yes, I've heard you've developed
an allergy to killing.

419
00:22:22,449 --> 00:22:24,866
Do it!
Or what?

420
00:22:24,868 --> 00:22:27,602
You'll kill me?

421
00:22:46,255 --> 00:22:48,340
You're really on
the no killing wagon?

422
00:22:48,342 --> 00:22:50,308
Shame.

423
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:53,561
Really letting one of life's true
pleasures pass you by.

424
00:23:00,394 --> 00:23:04,614
But you said you didn't want
to testify.

425
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:07,617
But you have to.

426
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,003
Because of me.
No.

427
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:11,170
You have to do
damage control.

428
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:12,622
None of this is your fault.

429
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:14,841
We're here because
of what I did.

430
00:23:16,677 --> 00:23:17,927
Now, you both
know the truth,

431
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,179
but you don't know
all of it.

432
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:22,298
Laurel does.

433
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,567
What does she have?

434
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:29,889
You shouldn't have
to find this out in court.

435
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:31,841
Find out what?

436
00:23:34,862 --> 00:23:39,432
Years ago--
it was many yes ago...

437
00:23:41,452 --> 00:23:45,154
Your father
was engaging in his--

438
00:23:45,156 --> 00:23:49,158
his extramarital activities.

439
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,079
And I had a moment of weakness.

440
00:23:54,915 --> 00:23:59,185
I cheated on him.

441
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,204
With Malcolm Merlyn.

442
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:07,460
No.

443
00:24:07,462 --> 00:24:10,446
No, I--

444
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,932
I asked you about this.

445
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:15,635
Last year.

446
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:18,521
You said that there was nothing
between you two!

447
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,107
There wasn't.
Sweetheart, it wasn't an affair.

448
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:23,576
It was very brief,
and a long time ago.

449
00:24:23,578 --> 00:24:26,362
And despite it, you remained
friends with Mr. Merlyn.

450
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,415
In fact, he frequently
attended parties at your home.

451
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:32,952
He was my husband's
best friend until Malcolm killed him.

452
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:35,088
And this is why
you claimed to feel

453
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,789
as though you were
in fear for your life

454
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:38,541
and the lives
of your children?

455
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,493
Well, I think it's a fairly
compelling reason.

456
00:24:40,495 --> 00:24:42,712
Last year,

457
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:45,264
your second husband,
Walter Steel,

458
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:48,768
was abducted by Mr. Merlyn,
is that correct?

459
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,054
Yes. So you so.

460
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,496
Why didn't Merlyn kill Walter,
the same as your first husband?

461
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:58,277
I convinced Malcolm not to.

462
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:01,147
And Malcolm
listened to you.

463
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:04,617
Your friend spared
Walter's life,

464
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:07,070
and yet, you'd have
this jury believing

465
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,788
that you and your children
were in danger?

466
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,189
We were. I was afraid--

467
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:13,076
Afraid of getting caught.

468
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:17,664
Despite whatever youthful
mistakes I might have made,

469
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:20,866
Malcolm Merlyn
was a dangerous man.

470
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:22,301
To other people.

471
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:24,971
But the only person
who truly posed a danger

472
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:27,129
to Moira Queen
and her family

473
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,930
was Moira Queen.

474
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:52,458
Hey.

475
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:54,477
Ok, if you want
to attack me, go right ahead.

476
00:25:54,478 --> 00:25:56,278
But you should know that you're
not going to say anything

477
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,980
that I haven't already
said to myself.

478
00:25:57,982 --> 00:26:00,983
Whoa. I know that that
was difficult for you,

479
00:26:00,985 --> 00:26:03,368
and I just want to make
sure that you're ok.

480
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:06,705
No, no.

481
00:26:06,707 --> 00:26:09,024
I don't understand
how you can forgive me

482
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:11,493
after what I just did in there.

483
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,501
I don't understand
how anyone could.

484
00:26:19,707 --> 00:26:22,976
So, obviously you three

485
00:26:22,978 --> 00:26:26,212
took the Hosen
out of this cave.

486
00:26:26,214 --> 00:26:28,015
Lift him up.

487
00:26:28,017 --> 00:26:29,816
Now I know
he doesn't have it,

488
00:26:29,818 --> 00:26:31,268
which means
one of you two does.

489
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,154
Give it to me,  and we'll discuss
an exchange.

490
00:26:34,156 --> 00:26:35,655
We don't know
what you're talking about.

491
00:26:35,657 --> 00:26:37,574
Give us Oliver,

492
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:39,826
and we'll leave you
alone to look for it.

493
00:26:39,828 --> 00:26:40,911
Aah!

494
00:26:40,913 --> 00:26:42,996
Anybody else
want to be stupid?

495
00:26:42,998 --> 00:26:45,699
Hey. Hey!

496
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:48,035
Fine.
Take 'em.

497
00:26:48,037 --> 00:26:50,670
Cut him loose.

498
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:55,542
What are you doing?!

499
00:27:05,219 --> 00:27:07,587
We have to keep moving,
they're following us!

500
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,650
Obviously we're
continuing to monitor

501
00:27:20,652 --> 00:27:22,435
both of these
major stories

502
00:27:22,437 --> 00:27:24,871
in what has become a significant
news day here in Starling.

503
00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:26,606
What can you
tell us about--

504
00:27:26,608 --> 00:27:29,543
Oliver's going to be pretty
wrapped up with his mother.

505
00:27:29,545 --> 00:27:31,244
You making any process
on how The Count's

506
00:27:31,246 --> 00:27:32,779
getting Vertigo
into people's systems?

507
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:34,981
Not much.

508
00:27:34,983 --> 00:27:36,933
Each dot is the home of somebody
with withdrawal symptoms.

509
00:27:36,935 --> 00:27:38,585
That seems pretty random.

510
00:27:38,587 --> 00:27:41,421
That's because
it's very random.

511
00:27:41,423 --> 00:27:43,557
Ok.

512
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:46,576
What if people
weren't exposed at home;

513
00:27:46,578 --> 00:27:48,512
what if they got dosed at work?

514
00:27:48,514 --> 00:27:51,248
Can you do this
by their employment addresses?

515
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,566
I'm really
starting to wonder

516
00:27:52,568 --> 00:27:54,468
what it would take
to impress you guys.

517
00:27:57,322 --> 00:27:59,573
It's a trail.
A path through the city.

518
00:27:59,575 --> 00:28:01,024
Any place you've been?

519
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:02,692
59th and Dell, that's where
I got my flu shot.

520
00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:04,911
You got your vaccination
from one of those trucks, right?

521
00:28:04,913 --> 00:28:07,364
One of those roving
flu trucks?

522
00:28:07,366 --> 00:28:09,533
The route.

523
00:28:09,535 --> 00:28:10,927
It's a flu vaccination tour.

524
00:28:10,952 --> 00:28:12,953
A truck sent out by
Starling City Mobile Care.

525
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:15,922
I got addicted after one injection?
That can happen?

526
00:28:15,924 --> 00:28:17,624
Sure. Try heroin
some time.

527
00:28:17,626 --> 00:28:19,543
Not try...Try.

528
00:28:19,545 --> 00:28:20,961
All right,
where's the truck now?

529
00:28:20,963 --> 00:28:23,547
Downtown.
What do you think?

530
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:25,515
Call Oliver?

531
00:28:25,517 --> 00:28:28,301
No, no, he's busy
with his family. I'll go.

532
00:28:28,303 --> 00:28:30,554
Yeah, no. That's
not happening.

533
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:31,771
I'll go.

534
00:28:31,773 --> 00:28:34,307
Felicity,
it's too dangerous.

535
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:36,776
It could turn out to be nothing.
If it's not, I'll call.

536
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:38,945
...courtroom drama
you've just witnessed?

537
00:28:38,947 --> 00:28:41,364
Bethany, no one expected
the turn that testimony took.

538
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:45,318
A revelation that Moira Queen
once had an affair with Malcolm Merlyn

539
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,239
became the sole focus
of the prosecution's cross.

540
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:02,452
Hello?

541
00:29:05,673 --> 00:29:08,041
Anybody home?

542
00:29:20,888 --> 00:29:22,689
Vertigo. Got ya.

543
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:24,407
Funny, eh?

544
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:27,477
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

545
00:29:34,236 --> 00:29:36,239
Thea?

546
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,706
Can we call it a night?

547
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:40,626
Jury just signaled
that they could have a verdict.

548
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:43,579
Judge will not send them home.
He wants to get this over with.

549
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,196
Line forms behind me.

550
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:47,499
A verdict that
quickly is bad, isn't it?

551
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:52,078
I think the two of you
should prepare for the worst.

552
00:29:57,652 --> 00:30:00,036
Excuse me.

553
00:30:00,038 --> 00:30:00,977
Felicity...

554
00:30:00,978 --> 00:30:02,894
Oliver.

555
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:07,561
Is it ok
if I call you Oliver?

556
00:30:07,563 --> 00:30:10,597
Surprised to hear
from me, right?

557
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:13,049
Not as surprised
as I was.

558
00:30:13,051 --> 00:30:15,718
You see, I find this

559
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,022
not unattractive blonde,
getting all up in my business.

560
00:30:19,024 --> 00:30:21,691
And what does she
have on her?

561
00:30:21,693 --> 00:30:24,911
A Queen Consolidated
I.D. badge.

562
00:30:24,913 --> 00:30:29,165
Now, I think to myself,
why does that name ring a bell?

563
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:31,668
Oliver Queen.

564
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,004
He tried
to buy off me last year,

565
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:37,290
just before the hood
put me in a padded cell.

566
00:30:37,292 --> 00:30:41,127
Ipso facto, Arrow.

567
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:44,297
Where are you going?!

568
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:46,383
Oh...

569
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:48,751
Something's come up
at the office.

570
00:30:48,753 --> 00:30:50,971
Ollie, the jury!

571
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:53,556
I have to go.

572
00:31:21,268 --> 00:31:25,138
Pretty swanky offices.

573
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,009
You can see all the destruction
that your mom caused

574
00:31:29,011 --> 00:31:30,927
from up here.

575
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:33,313
What do you want?

576
00:31:33,315 --> 00:31:35,815
World peace
and personal satisfaction.

577
00:31:35,817 --> 00:31:40,403
Though not necessarily
in that order.

578
00:31:40,405 --> 00:31:44,441
You poisoned me
and put me in a hole.

579
00:31:44,443 --> 00:31:48,328
You have no idea
how much I hated you for that.

580
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:51,164
Turns out, someone else
hates you, too.

581
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:52,866
Who?
Who?

582
00:31:52,868 --> 00:31:55,435
Oh, you're going to be
surprised when you find out.

583
00:31:55,437 --> 00:31:57,837
He's a man of means.

584
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,124
Set me up with my new operation
so I could draw you out.

585
00:32:01,126 --> 00:32:03,093
To do what?
This.

586
00:32:06,764 --> 00:32:09,716
You're going to have
to try harder.

587
00:32:09,718 --> 00:32:12,102
Done!

588
00:32:18,526 --> 00:32:21,895
Come on!
Ahh!

589
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:29,619
So now we move on
to plan B.

590
00:32:29,621 --> 00:32:32,489
Oliver, don't!
Not for me!

591
00:32:32,491 --> 00:32:34,824
Quiet, please.
I'm threatening.

592
00:32:34,826 --> 00:32:37,994
Lower your bow.

593
00:32:47,037 --> 00:32:49,639
Your problem is with me.

594
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:51,241
It's not with her.

595
00:32:51,243 --> 00:32:53,309
Well, then, consider
this your penalty

596
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:55,979
for making me
go to plan B in the first place.

597
00:33:09,693 --> 00:33:12,612
Hey. Hey.

598
00:33:12,614 --> 00:33:14,447
Hey, shh, shh.

599
00:33:14,449 --> 00:33:16,866
It's all right.

600
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:18,168
You're safe.

601
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,503
Oh, you were shot.

602
00:33:20,505 --> 00:33:22,238
Hey.

603
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,707
It's nothing.

604
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:56,977
Any news?

605
00:33:56,978 --> 00:33:58,320
Where have you been?

606
00:34:00,408 --> 00:34:01,801
Something...

607
00:34:01,802 --> 00:34:03,601
happened at Queen Consolidated.

608
00:34:03,603 --> 00:34:06,438
You will see it
on the news later.

609
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,189
Just don't worry about it.

610
00:34:08,191 --> 00:34:10,975
What would you have done
if there'd been a verdict?

611
00:34:10,977 --> 00:34:12,727
Thea...

612
00:34:12,729 --> 00:34:15,397
I don't know.

613
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:17,148
Are you ok?

614
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,517
Hey.

615
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:21,152
Jury's back.

616
00:34:21,154 --> 00:34:23,121
Come on.

617
00:34:23,123 --> 00:34:28,460
I have received a note that
the jury has arrived at a verdict.

618
00:34:30,246 --> 00:34:33,364
Please publish
the verdict.

619
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,635
In the superior court
of Star county

620
00:34:37,637 --> 00:34:41,055
state versus
Moira Queen verdict...

621
00:34:41,057 --> 00:34:43,725
On one count of conspiracy
in the first degree,

622
00:34:43,727 --> 00:34:48,229
the defendant is found
not guilty.

623
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:51,382
On the 503 counts
of murder in the first degree,

624
00:34:51,384 --> 00:34:54,736
the defendant is found...

625
00:34:54,738 --> 00:34:58,222
Not guilty.

626
00:35:07,283 --> 00:35:09,233
Mom.

627
00:35:19,044 --> 00:35:22,079
I love you both so much.

628
00:35:31,273 --> 00:35:36,811
A stunning result, as Moira Queen is
acquitted of all charges.

629
00:35:36,813 --> 00:35:41,115
In a day that's provided a week's
worth of shocks and legal twists,

630
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:43,368
many had pronounced
this case a done deal.

631
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,870
Congratulations.

632
00:35:45,872 --> 00:35:48,490
Is that appropriate?
She should have lost.

633
00:35:48,492 --> 00:35:50,742
She should have been
convicted.

634
00:35:50,744 --> 00:35:53,995
Did you want her to be?

635
00:35:53,997 --> 00:35:56,331
I expected her to be.

636
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:58,383
Verdict doesn't make sense.

637
00:35:58,385 --> 00:36:00,251
Still, your mom
must be thrilled. Beyond.

638
00:36:00,253 --> 00:36:03,054
It's more like
shock, I think.

639
00:36:03,056 --> 00:36:07,759
They're processing her now.
I just wanted to check in on you.

640
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:09,561
And you.

641
00:36:09,563 --> 00:36:10,979
I'm feeling better.

642
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:13,681
And, with the Vertigo
tainted vaccine,

643
00:36:13,683 --> 00:36:15,733
Queen Consolidated's
Applied Sciences Division

644
00:36:15,735 --> 00:36:18,253
was able to formulate
a non-addictive treatment.

645
00:36:20,606 --> 00:36:22,857
Good.

646
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:26,194
I need to meet
my family at home.

647
00:36:26,196 --> 00:36:29,581
So you guys go home,
get rest.

648
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:34,869
Good night.

649
00:36:34,871 --> 00:36:37,622
Good night.

650
00:36:37,624 --> 00:36:40,925
Oliver. I, uh...

651
00:36:42,595 --> 00:36:44,062
I just wanted to say thank you.
Yeah.

652
00:36:44,064 --> 00:36:46,965
And I'm sorry.

653
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:49,517
For what?

654
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:52,237
I got myself
into trouble again,

655
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:54,205
and you...
killed him.

656
00:36:54,207 --> 00:36:58,109
You killed again,
and I am sorry that I was the one

657
00:36:58,111 --> 00:37:00,612
to put you in a position where you
had to make that kind of choice.

658
00:37:00,614 --> 00:37:02,864
Felicity...

659
00:37:02,866 --> 00:37:06,618
He had you, and he was
going to hurt you.

660
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:11,973
There was no choice to make.

661
00:37:19,665 --> 00:37:21,633
Why did you do that?!

662
00:37:21,635 --> 00:37:24,135
Because you stopped
the captain from killing me.

663
00:37:24,137 --> 00:37:26,137
Thank you for coming.

664
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:28,172
Shado, he doesn't
look too good.

665
00:37:28,174 --> 00:37:30,642
He's not.
Who's this?

666
00:37:30,644 --> 00:37:32,844
It's complicated.
That Hosen thing

667
00:37:32,846 --> 00:37:35,546
they're looking for
is back on the plane.

668
00:37:35,548 --> 00:37:38,683
No, I've got it.

669
00:37:38,685 --> 00:37:40,768
It has a Buddhist
inscription on one side.

670
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,520
It reminded me
of my father.

671
00:37:42,522 --> 00:37:45,356
I'm pretty sure they aren't
interested in Buddhism.

672
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:47,492
What's on
the other side?

673
00:37:47,494 --> 00:37:51,562
30-30-175-12.

674
00:37:51,564 --> 00:37:53,230
Ok, numbers, what...

675
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:55,533
Coordinates.

676
00:37:55,535 --> 00:37:57,919
To what?

677
00:37:57,921 --> 00:37:59,412
A Kairyu-class Japanese
submarine

678
00:37:59,437 --> 00:38:01,437
which ran aground
here during World War II.

679
00:38:02,175 --> 00:38:05,043
What do these guys want
with a 70 year old sub?

680
00:38:05,045 --> 00:38:07,378
The sub isn't important,
but what's on it...

681
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,082
It'll save the human race.

682
00:38:11,084 --> 00:38:13,885
Will it save him?

683
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:26,814
Well, you survived
your own stupidity, congratulations.

684
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,534
You know...

685
00:38:29,536 --> 00:38:31,235
I needed you

686
00:38:31,237 --> 00:38:33,204
to deal with any
resistance

687
00:38:33,206 --> 00:38:35,289
that I encountered on the island.
I got to say,

688
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:37,742
you've done a fairly
lousy job of that.

689
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:42,279
Congratulations.

690
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:46,217
You're the new captain.

691
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:53,224
I arranged for 
to take out the Arrow,

692
00:38:53,226 --> 00:38:55,093
and all I accomplish
is reigniting

693
00:38:55,095 --> 00:38:57,395
the vigilante's
killing spree.

694
00:38:57,397 --> 00:38:58,963
Sir, there's been
a development.

695
00:39:20,786 --> 00:39:24,088
Brother Cyrus...

696
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,258
How do you feel?

697
00:39:29,595 --> 00:39:31,963
Stronger.

698
00:39:31,965 --> 00:39:33,881
Good.

699
00:39:33,883 --> 00:39:37,835
Then you're ready.

700
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,974
Mrs. Queen, how does
it feel to get away with murder?

701
00:39:42,976 --> 00:39:45,610
Once you go out back,
there's a car waiting for you.

702
00:39:45,612 --> 00:39:47,779
Did you kill
your first husband?

703
00:39:47,781 --> 00:39:49,313
Just keep going.

704
00:39:49,315 --> 00:39:52,183
Obviously Mrs. Queen
is overjoyed that the jury

705
00:39:52,185 --> 00:39:55,203
has ruled that she was acting
under terrible duress.

706
00:39:55,205 --> 00:39:56,621
Can you
give us anything else?

707
00:39:56,623 --> 00:39:59,457
This way,
Mrs. Queen.

708
00:40:17,976 --> 00:40:20,978
The freeway
will be quicker.

709
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,513
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Queen.

710
00:40:22,515 --> 00:40:24,265
I was instructed
not to take you home.

711
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:25,817
Not yet.

712
00:40:36,662 --> 00:40:38,946
Where are we?

713
00:40:38,948 --> 00:40:40,832
I-I don't know
this place.

714
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:43,367
I've got her, sir.

715
00:40:48,457 --> 00:40:50,708
Hello, Moira.

716
00:40:54,013 --> 00:40:55,963
They said you were dead!

717
00:40:55,965 --> 00:40:57,748
There are parts of the world
where death is an illusion.

718
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,133
I've been to one.

719
00:40:59,135 --> 00:41:00,852
I learned to be
very convincing.

720
00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:05,723
But I returned because you
needed my help.

721
00:41:07,527 --> 00:41:09,426
Help?

722
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:11,362
With your trial.

723
00:41:11,364 --> 00:41:13,231
You didn't think that
jury acquitted you

724
00:41:13,233 --> 00:41:14,565
without a little
persuasion?

725
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:17,268
Dear God.

726
00:41:18,704 --> 00:41:21,823
What do you want, Malcolm?

727
00:41:21,825 --> 00:41:26,210
I still have
resources in Starling.

728
00:41:26,212 --> 00:41:27,962
Associates.

729
00:41:27,964 --> 00:41:30,164
Including one

730
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:32,616
in the D.A.'s office.

731
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:36,170
I followed Mr. Donner's
investigation of you with interest.

732
00:41:36,172 --> 00:41:38,339
The ease with which you lied
about us for years,

733
00:41:38,341 --> 00:41:41,008
it made me wonder
whether you lied to me

734
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,894
No. No.

735
00:41:42,896 --> 00:41:46,814
It was a matter of a simple
surreptitious genetics test

736
00:41:46,816 --> 00:41:49,650
to confirm my suspicion.
Don't.

737
00:41:49,652 --> 00:41:52,353
Imagine my joy
at learning that

738
00:41:52,355 --> 00:41:55,773
Thea is my daughter.
