1
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,105
Andrews,
have a look.

2
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:08,407
I've never seen
anything like it.

3
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:11,410
I've seen you see something
just like it, Nelson.

4
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:13,245
It's called a tortoise.

5
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:14,580
No, no.
Look here.

6
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:17,683
There's
something encrusted
onto its shell.

7
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:18,951
Oh, my.

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,487
Whatever could it be?

9
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,871
Breathe deeply.

10
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,840
(Inhaling and exhaling)

11
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,677
The breathe flows to
the fingertips,

12
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,712
then down to the toes...

13
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:24,216
Then the toes
go up...

14
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,418
The bad guy's
nose.

15
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,586
Hyah!

16
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,761
What? He was
asking for it.

17
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,696
Discipline, Jade.

18
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,598
But I want to be
a lean, mean,

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,200
Jackie chan
machine.

20
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:46,305
Don't be in such a hurry.
Slow and steady wins the race.

21
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,140
Chinese proverb,
right?

22
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:52,678
Uh, Greek, actually.
The story of the tortoise
and the hare.

23
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,414
Once upon a--where you going?

24
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,316
Breakfast.
Race ya!

25
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:58,484
Ahhh!

26
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:02,955
Morning, Jackie.

27
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:04,156
Hello, Kevin.

28
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:05,224
It's going to be
sunny today.

29
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:07,526
I have to take
your word for it.

30
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,263
Newscaster:
Today's weather forecast,

31
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:14,133
clear and sunny with highs
in the mid 80's
for the bay area.

32
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:15,200
Morning, Jade.

33
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,301
Hey, Carlos.

34
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,070
And now for local events.

35
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:21,540
This big fellow's name
is aesop, and he's the star

36
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,176
of the new
galapagos island exhibit
at the bay aquarium.

37
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:27,679
Tortoise?
Talk about your coinkadink.

38
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:30,015
The odd thing is,
the aquarium's experts

39
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,384
noticed this little
"who knows what"

40
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,686
imbedded
in aesop's shell.

41
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,589
A tortoise and a hare?

42
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:38,857
Jackie!

43
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,326
What?

44
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,195
That!

45
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,631
No, we are not
getting a dog.

46
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:46,899
I saw a talisman.

47
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:49,334
It's on the tortoise's shell
at the bay aquarium.

48
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,070
It had 2 long ears
like a bunny.

49
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,205
The tortoise?

50
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:55,707
No. The talisman.

51
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,211
Huh. There is a rabbit
in the Chinese zodiac.

52
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:00,546
I will investigate.

53
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:01,613
Cool.

54
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,582
While you're in school.

55
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:04,683
Aw.

56
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,059
Stop!

57
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,195
Valmont, hey.
New suite? Heh heh.
Lookin' sharp.

58
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,663
Go back one.

59
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:23,569
Tohru.

60
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,809
So there I was,
flying the plane
all by myself,

61
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,811
no co-pilot, and
Jackie's hanging out

62
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,012
the back
flopping around

63
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,747
with no parachute
or anything.

64
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:39,251
Yeah, right. I bet
the snake lady
was there, too.

65
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,386
Viper? Nah.
That was in
New York.

66
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,688
Teacher: Jade!

67
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,024
Perhaps you can answer
the question for us.

68
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,993
Uh, that last
question

69
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:50,028
or the one
before it,
miss hardman?

70
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,365
The question you would
have heard if you were
paying attention.

71
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:56,935
Perhaps you need
an extra-credit
assignment.

72
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,972
Hmm. Dibs on
the topic?

73
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,043
The rabbit talisman.

74
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,546
The question is
how to remove it.

75
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:10,148
No need to worry about
harming aesop's shell.

76
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,351
It's very durable.

77
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:15,153
Uh, little girl,
this area is off limits.

78
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,289
Little girl?

79
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,590
Jade!

80
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,760
You should be home.
That's why they
call it homework?

81
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,496
Uh-uh-uh.
It's legit.
Research.

82
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,265
I'm doing
a report
on aesop.

83
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,601
Look, Jade, that really is
a talisman on the tortoise,

84
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,238
and if you saw it
on TV we can bet
the dark hand did, too.

85
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,608
(Scoffs) Like
bad guys watch...

86
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:41,980
Jade: TV.

87
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,850
Chan?

88
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,318
Go! Take Jade.

89
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,452
Ohh!

90
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,790
Ooh!

91
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,460
Uhh!
- Ugh!
- Eh!

92
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,136
Uhh.

93
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,738
Hyah! Ooh!

94
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,473
Puh, pluh, ptooey.

95
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,784
Ooh?

96
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,786
Aah!

97
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,403
Hyah!

98
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,906
And I'm getting
extra credit for this.

99
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:41,973
Whoop!

100
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,442
Uhh. Uh. Uh.

101
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,283
Uh, ew, uh.
Let go of me.

102
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:52,417
Ooh!

103
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,089
(Growling)

104
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:58,690
Mm-mmm, uh, mm.

105
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,002
Aah!

106
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,372
Jade: Jackie!

107
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,574
The tortoise.

108
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,886
(Sighing)

109
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,559
Jackie,
what do we do?

110
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,827
Mm-mmm!

111
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,230
Which way?

112
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,234
I'll make
him talk.
Whoop!

113
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:45,404
Remember, slow and steady
wins the race.

114
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,106
I like
my plan better.

115
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:51,943
Yuck!

116
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,247
Now, let's watch and learn.

117
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:58,617
You know, shendu,

118
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:02,721
these talisman
expeditions--let's just
say I'm racking up

119
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:06,558
some hefty out-of-pocket
expenses and as of yet

120
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,628
there's nothing
coming back into
my pocket.

121
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:16,034
When and only when your men
acquire all 12 talismans,

122
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,670
the lost treasure
of chin chi wong

123
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:24,142
shall cover your expenses
10 thousand times over.

124
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:27,078
The reputed
lost treasure.

125
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,315
Ahh. So we have a sceptic.

126
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,857
Aah! Ooh!

127
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:47,265
Patience, valmont.
Slow and steady
wins the race.

128
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,344
Ahem.
Valmont, we scored
the talisman.

129
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,348
Heh heh heh.
And the team mascot.

130
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,618
You have the tortoise?

131
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,056
When chan showed,
we had to bail
with the snail.

132
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:14,259
Prepare for a detour.
I have an acquaintance

133
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:18,163
whom I'm certain
will pay top dollar
for our endangered friend.

134
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,932
That's why you're
the boss, "v".

135
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,201
Whoa! Getting
another call.

136
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,436
Hello.

137
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:26,805
Yo, ratso.

138
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,108
Oh, well,
sorry, dude.

139
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,544
Forget sorry.
I need a ride.

140
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:33,979
Where?

141
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,914
Yeah. I can find it.

142
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,383
He's arranging
to meet with
the others.

143
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,886
Cool!
Now we jump him?

144
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,687
Keep low,
he'll see us.

145
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,789
But this time wait for me!

146
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,427
Quick! Jump in.

147
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,130
Hey!

148
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,198
Jade.

149
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,432
Uncle?

150
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,135
Grr!

151
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,371
So how was school?

152
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,540
Peachy.

153
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,976
Aah. Peachy.

154
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:08,914
One more thing.
Did Jackie find
the rabbit talisman?

155
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:17,155
(Growling) I am not Jade.
I am paigon the powerful,
ruler of the rabbit realm.

156
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,990
Ohh! Aah!

157
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,126
(Growling)
I must fulfill my destiny

158
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:24,496
or the universe itself
shall become <i> un-made.</i>

159
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,298
Release me at once.

160
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,471
(Coughing)
Man, that's rough
on the throat.

161
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,629
We're
outnumbered.
Aah!

162
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:05,637
Don't you have
a report to do?

163
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,840
Hello. Research?
Need the tortoise.

164
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,542
Gentlemen.

165
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:13,545
Are you Karl niver?

166
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:18,683
Ni-vor. Dr. Karl nivor.
In the flesh.

167
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,420
Who's this
nivor guy?

168
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,222
Shh!

169
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:28,093
And this fellow must be
the merchandise of which
my friend valmont spoke.

170
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,663
Mmm, yes.

171
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:34,265
You're a fine specimen,
aren't you?

172
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,800
Aren't you?

173
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,202
The money!

174
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,172
Boris,
pay the man.

175
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,546
Care to join me
for dinner?

176
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,115
Thank you, no.

177
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,152
But we're having
quite the delicacy.

178
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,922
A dish so rare,
you might say
it's endangered.

179
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,425
Turtle soup.

180
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,795
Eww. He's gonna
eat aesop?

181
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,666
Oh. He's gonna
eat aesop.

182
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:10,435
Are you sure?
Hmm?

183
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,705
Yes, we, uh--uh--um--
must deliver this
to valmont.

184
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,510
Ohh. Tohru has
the talisman.

185
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,478
He's going to
eat aesop.

186
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,689
Well? The sooner
you fetch a forklift,

187
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,391
the sooner
I may lift a fork
to my lips.

188
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,094
Wait here.

189
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:40,565
Whoa!

190
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,400
Jackie!
Where you going?

191
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,902
After the talisman.

192
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,403
But what about aesop?

193
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,772
You could choose another
topic for your report.

194
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,774
Duh! This isn't about
the report.

195
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:53,111
Aesop's going to be
that creepy guy's din-din
if we don't do something.

196
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:54,713
We will do
something--

197
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,115
after I get
the talisman.
Follow me.

198
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,616
But you never want me
to follow you,

199
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,118
and aesop's in
immediate danger.

200
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,653
Jade, we don't
know what power

201
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,054
this talisman
possesses.

202
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,957
If the dark hand
gets it, people
could be in danger.

203
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:09,928
Oh, so you're ok letting
something that looks
just like uncle get eaten?

204
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,298
Ohh! Where do you
come up with
these things? Huh?

205
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,466
Chan?

206
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,702
I thought I heard
your voice.

207
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,340
Maim him.

208
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,944
Jade: Whoa!
Jackie: Ooh!

209
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,245
Aah!
Ohh!

210
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,729
Ha! Whoo!
Aah!
- Uhh!

211
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,900
Whoo. Grr.

212
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,470
Uhh!

213
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,376
Aah!

214
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,548
Ooh! Aah!
Huh? Whoa!

215
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:05,950
Uhh!

216
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,622
Ooh! Uncle.

217
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,689
Where?

218
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,024
Eyah!
- Ooh!

219
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,226
Tohru: Ooh!

220
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,562
Tohru!

221
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,067
(Fighting in plane)

222
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,809
Ooh!

223
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,312
Careful!

224
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,948
That one
turns you into
a chocolate bunny.

225
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,991
How did you get
down there...So fast?

226
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,261
Aah!

227
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:51,629
Ooh!

228
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,097
Mmm...Peppy.

229
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,604
Boris,
that braised manatee
you prepared last week

230
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:03,141
was absolutely exquisite
and the grilled
American condor

231
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,079
on a bed
of fava beans...

232
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,181
(Smacking lips)
To die for.

233
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,185
Don't forget
the carrots.

234
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,121
I'll be aft
in the study.

235
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,238
Unh! Unh!

236
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,073
Uhh!

237
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,209
Who's a--

238
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,944
chocolate--

239
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,112
bunny--

240
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,247
now?

241
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,815
Hmm?

242
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,650
Uhh!

243
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:46,718
Whoa!

244
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,786
Big man
can move.

245
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,188
(Growling)

246
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,027
Whoa!

247
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,729
Something's--aah!

248
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,065
Tohru: Aah!

249
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,273
Jade?

250
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:12,944
Jade!

251
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,914
Uhh!
Come on.
Come on.

252
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,715
(Meat locker shuts)

253
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,935
Stop!

254
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,270
Heh.

255
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,838
Pretty please?

256
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,548
A stowaway?

257
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,351
Release aesop, you
tortoise-eating creep.

258
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,588
Such a delightful child.

259
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,726
She'll go well with
a nice bernaise sauce,
wouldn't you say, Boris?

260
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,828
(Gasp) What?

261
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,763
Only joking, Princess.

262
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,802
Children are much too common
for my sophisticated palate.

263
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:16,007
Lock her up
and get on with my dinner.
I'm getting cranky.

264
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,977
Jade! Jade! Jade.

265
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,613
How like--

266
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:23,748
duh!

267
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,256
(Clanking)

268
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,324
Jade?

269
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,392
Jade!

270
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,227
Jackie, I'm in here.

271
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:41,199
Whoa. How'd you go
there to here
so fast?

272
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,568
And now we'll save
the tortoise.

273
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,205
See? Slow and steady
wins the race.

274
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,508
But you have
super rabbit speed.

275
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,144
I'm getting
mixed messages here.

276
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,313
Oh--eh--uh--don't be smart.

277
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,782
Whoop!

278
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,684
Valmont,

279
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,187
your men are supposed
to find talismans,
not sell pets.

280
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,825
Perhaps
if you had given
fair consideration

281
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,460
to the advance
I requested,

282
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,529
none of this would
have---

283
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,400
whoa. I did not know
he could do that.

284
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,807
I assure you, shendu,
the rabbit talisman
will be retrieved.

285
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,743
How right you are.

286
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,223
Kitchen's closed.

287
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,635
Uhh!
- Jackie: Come on.

288
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,377
Unh! Ah!

289
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,879
Uhh!
- Eh!

290
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,014
Ohh!

291
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:06,784
Uh-oh.

292
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,119
Out here?

293
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,062
Ha ha ha.
What's up, doc?

294
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:52,797
What?
How did you--

295
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,101
I want my dinner.

296
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,639
Whaa!

297
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,010
Whoa!

298
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,919
Jade and doctor: Huh?

299
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,858
<i>Vamoose!</i>

300
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,593
What?

301
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,397
Uh...Welcome?

302
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,435
I don't have it.

303
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,671
Charge!

304
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,407
Huh? Oh!

305
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,413
Jade: Wahoo!

306
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,488
Ah! Anyone
for leftovers?

307
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:57,228
Boy: Oh, come on!
A turbo turtle?

308
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,663
Faster than
a speeding rabbit.

309
00:19:58,665 --> 00:19:59,730
No way!

310
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:00,798
Way!

311
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,567
Yeah, right.

312
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,468
I bet that super
strong ox guy
was there, too.

313
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,438
Jade: El toro? Nah.
That was in Mexico
when I was flying the plane.

314
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,882
Boy:
- Hey, Jackie, do you like
to watch television?

315
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:21,085
Yes. I learn so many things
on television.

316
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,287
You know, my English
I learned from the TV.

317
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,624
I like education channel,
discovery channel.

318
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,693
Even cartoon
I can learn something.

319
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:30,094
I want TV.

320
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,530
I'm only in Hong Kong.

321
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,632
I can watch
what's going on in Morocco.

322
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:38,202
What's going on
South Africa and Europe,
everywhere.

323
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:41,906
And really learn
a lot of things
I don't know before.

324
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,908
Even training, I watch TV.

325
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,910
TV is my teacher.

326
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,078
I love TV.
