00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,546
THIS LAPTOP CONTAINS
40 MILLION RUBLES

00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:06,715
WORTH OF BANK TRANSFERS
FROM KOVAR

4
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,175
THAT GREGOR HASN'T
DISCLOSED.

5
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,677
THIS IS MOST
DISAPPOINTING.

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,386
I LIKED MANY OF YOU.

WITH A VERY SPECIFIC,
UNIQUE MOVE.

9
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,725
IT WAS TAUGHT TO ME
BY A WOMAN THAT I MET
IN RUSSIA.

10
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,686
YOU THINK YOU
AND PROMETHEUS HAD
THE SAME TEACHER?

11
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,688
YOU'RE ACCEPTING
THE INVITATION
TO JOIN HELIX.

12
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,981
FULL THROTTLE.

13
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,190
WHAT DO I DO
WITH YOUR SECRET?

14
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,942
I KEEP IT. I CARE
ABOUT THE CITY,

15
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:26,610
AND...AND YOU'RE WORKING
DOUBLE-TIME.

16
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,069
CAN YOU TALK SOME
SENSE INTO HIM, PLEASE?

17
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,906
MR. MAYOR, THEA,
MEET MY WIFE DORIS.

18
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,366
I THOUGHT
WE COULD TALK.

19
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,075
CAN WE SET UP
A MEETING TOMORROW?

20
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,161
I'M LATE FOR A DINNER.

21
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,205
IT'S IMPORTANT.

22
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,999
YOU COULD CALL IT
LIFE OR DEATH.

23
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,974
YOU SURE THIS
IS THE PLACE?

SOMETHING ABOUT A DEMON...

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,689
OH, WAIT, MAYBE
THAT SAYS, "LEMON."

27
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:06,441
ANYWAY, I...I TEXTED HER,
BUT SHE HAS NOT HIT ME BACK.

28
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,529
IT SAYS, "DEMON."

29
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,822
OLIVER, I'M LOSING YOU!

30
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,073

WHO ARE YOU?

35
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,222
I'M A FORMER

36
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,892
FORMER, WHICH MEANS
YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE.

LEAVE US.

39
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,960
I WOULD APOLOGIZE
FOR MY STUDENTS'
ENTHUSIASM,

40
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:09,088
BUT YOU SHOULD NOT
HAVE COME TO THIS PLACE.

41
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,799
WELL, TALIA, IT WAS
DIFFICULT TO FIND.

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,134
OUR BUSINESS TOGETHER
CONCLUDED 5 YEARS AGO.

43
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,762
NO. ONE OF YOUR
FORMER STUDENTS

44
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,097
IS TRYING TO KILL ME.

45
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,307
OH, HE DOESN'T WANT
TO KILL YOU, OLIVER.

46
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,810
HE MEANS TO DESTROY
YOU UTTERLY.

47
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,979
YOU KNEW?

48
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,689
IF YOU KNEW, THEN WHY
WOULD YOU TRAIN HIM?

49
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,608
WHY WOULDN'T YOU
WARN ME?

50
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,861
TWO YEARS AGO,
HE SOUGHT ME OUT.

51
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,446
HE'D ALREADY LEARNED
MUCH ABOUT YOU.

52
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,698
HE'S A MAN
OF REMARKABLE CAPACITY.

53
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,908
TALIA, ENOUGH!

54
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,867
IF YOU KNEW
WHAT HE WANTED,

55
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,661
THEN WHY WOULD YOU
TRAIN HIM?

56
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,455
YOU KILLED HIS FATHER,

57
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,624
AND I HELPED HIM
IN HIS PURSUIT
OF VENGEANCE

58
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,043
BECAUSE BY THEN
YOU'D KILLED MINE!

59
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,134
I NEVER TOLD YOU
MY FULL NAME, DID I?

00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,105
YES.

65
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,442
MY FATHER AND I CAME
TO BE AT ODDS,

66
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,235
SO I FORGED
MY OWN PATH...

67
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,531
BUT HE WAS STILL
MY FATHER WHEN YOU PUT

68
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,408
A SWORD THROUGH
HIS CHEST.

69
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,744
SO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
NOT GONNA HELP ME.

70
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,833
THAT'S WHY YOU WON'T
TELL WHO THIS...

TO SUFFER.

-WHOA.
-YEAH. IT'S LIT, RIGHT?

THEY'RE JUST...

80
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,210
YOU SOUND SURPRISED.

81
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,794
YEAH. I MEAN, I GUESS
I JUST THOUGHT

82
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,379
THAT A SECRET HACKER

83
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,758

THINK WE STOLE

RUNNING THROUGH
A PATTERN RECOGNITION ALGO.

95
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,117
HOLY...
THAT'S...

96
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,994
SO MUCH BIGGER THAN
ANYTHING THE NSA IS
DOING. I KNOW.

97
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,371
THAT'S A LOT OF POWER
FOR SOMEONE TO HAVE
WHO'S NOT GOVERNMENT.

98
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,750
WELL, THE FACT THAT
WE'RE NOT GOVERNMENT'S
NOT THE POINT.

AND THEY WILL
KILL US ALL.

123
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,585
GONNA TRY IT
THIS WAY NOW.

124
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,964
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
I DON'T KNOW HOW

125
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,341
THAT MASK IS
GONNA PLAY HERE,

126
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:06,051
ESPECIALLY SINCE
THE CITY'S NOT TOO FOND

I'LL GIVE THEM
THE THROWING STAR KILLER,

129
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,265

130
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,891
WAIT. THAT'S
YOUR BIG PLAN,

ARRESTING ME?

132
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:18,021
OH, MAN, THAT'S
A BIT OF A LETDOWN,
I HAVE TO SAY.

133
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,982
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA
KILL YOU,

134
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,777
IF ONLY BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO.

135
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:27,364
BUT YOU'VE DONE
EVERYTHING I'VE
WANTED SO FAR.

136
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,784
DID YOU REALLY THINK
I'D LET ALL THIS END
IN A PARKING GARAGE?

137
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,411
WHAT DID YOU DO?

138
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,788
I GAVE YOUR GIRLFRIEND
AN EXCLUSIVE.

139

WAIT. ARE YOU STILL
DATING SUSAN WILLIAMS?

140
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,000
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
BUDDY.

141
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,294
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE
HARD TO KEEP TRACK.

142
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,295
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO HER?

143
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,504
SHE'S FINE. DON'T WORRY.

144
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,174
AS LONG AS I'M AROUND
TO MAKE SURE SHE GETS
SOME FOOD AND WATER.

145
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,842
STARVATION
AND DEHYDRATION...

146
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,970
TERRIBLE WAY TO GO.

147
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,890
BOTTOM LINE...I DIE,
SHE DIES.

148
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,516
I DON'T MAKE IT BACK
TO HER IN TIME,

149
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,102
SHE DIES.

150
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,353
NOW YOU COULD TRY
TORTURING ME

151
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,604
FOR HER LOCATION.

152
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:00,897
WE BOTH KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE CAPABLE OF

153
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,399
IN THAT DEPARTMENT,
BUT...

154
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:05,444
I THINK THAT WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF,

155
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,239
SO, OLLIE, WHO DO YOU
THINK CAN LAST LONGER...

156

OLIVER.

777
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:58,248
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN KILLING YOU.

778
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,709
THEN WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS GAME THAT
WE'RE PLAYING?

779
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:11,136
WHEN I HAD SUSAN
AS MY GUEST,

780
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,305
I CONFESSED TO HER
THAT YOU'D HELPED ME

781
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:15,265
DISCOVER WHO I
REALLY AM.

782
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,937
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA
HELP YOU DO, OLIVER.

783
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:02,479
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
