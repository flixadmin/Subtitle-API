<i>from rogue time travelers.</i>

4
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:08,884
<i>But they were destroyed.</i>

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:13,602

What the hell is going on out here?

Sorry, sir. He broke through
the security cordon downstairs.

19
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,912
Only because they wouldn't let me up
without an appointment,

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,870
but how does a regular guy
get an appointment with the Mayor, anyway?

21
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,375
Heywood. Dr. Nate Heywood.

22
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:23,008
I'm, uh, here to talk about Sara Lance,
Ray Palmer, and the rest of the Legends.

23
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,007
(PANTS) I think they're all in trouble.

24
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:32,051
Thank you for not
having me arrested back there.

25
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,810
Those security guards really overreacted.

26
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,095
You know, one of them tried to mace me.

27
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:38,983
Dr. Heywood, I only agreed to give you
five minutes, which was three minutes ago,

28
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,235
because Ray and Sara are friends of mine.

29
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:44,818
But I don't know the first thing
about any Legends.

30
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,815
Of course you do.
Because you're the Green Arrow.

31
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,358
Excuse me?

32
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,656
Huh?

33
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,282
We're done here.

34
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,699
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to drop a bomb on you like that,

35
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,415
it's just I've exhausted
all my normal avenues,

36
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:02,002
and you're the only person left
who won't think I'm crazy.

37
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,541
Are you sure about that?

38
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:07,587
I'm a historian. I specialize
in deductive historical reconstruction.

39
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:10,506
In layman's terms, I'm a time detective.

40
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,642
Which I really don't have to be
to look at a calendar to see

41
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:17,681
one week after you came to this city,
Robin Hood showed up.

42
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,474
You said that Sara and Ray are...

43
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,518
Traveling throughout time
with the other Legends.

44
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,732
"Legends" is what they call themselves.

45
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:28,069
Now, for the past six months, I've been
noticing subtle changes to history,

46
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,699
almost imperceptible.

47
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,201
Actually, if it wasn't
for a friend of mine

48
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,407
who's a quantum physicist,

49
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,992
I wouldn't have been able to detect
the subluminal alterations.

50
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,580
The point being,
I think your friends are responsible.

52

You're looking at me
like you want evidence. Evidence, okay.

53
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:47,009
An illuminated manuscript from 1216
depicting a knight,

54
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,669
looks a lot like your friend Dr. Palmer,

55
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,382
same nose and chin.

56
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:54,140
A hieratic text describing a woman
in white with a bo staff,

57
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,306
a hieroglyphic from Mesopotamia,

58
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,642
depicting an albeit crude ship
that flies through the air and disappears.

59
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,807
Let's skip to the part
where they're in trouble.

60
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,317
UFO sighting, New York City, 1942.

61
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,650
Multiple witnesses report a flying machine

62
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,030
diving into the Atlantic,

63
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,442
which matches not only the
Mesopotamian hieroglyphics...

64
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,825
(CLEARS THROAT)
The part where they're in trouble!

65
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,282
Contemporaneous with the sighting
were multiple reports

66
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,039
of an underwater detonation
of an atomic bomb.

67
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,997
Now, the government has denied this.

68
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,786
You said in 1942.

69
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,206
That's three years before...

70
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,251
Before the atomic bomb
was supposedly invented, yes.

71
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,344
I told you history was changing.

72
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,848
Dr. Heywood,
if the Legends' ship met an A-bomb,

73
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,594
they're not in trouble,

74
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,392
they're dead.

75
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,742
OLIVER: <i>We're closing in
on your coordinates, Dr. Heywood.</i>

76
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,494
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Are you seeing
the sonar readings of the sea floor?</i>

77
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,031
<i>Either that's a really weird-looking
rock formation...</i>

78
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,541
OLIVER: <i>Or the wreckage of a Timeship.</i>

79
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,007
If the Legends went down with the ship...

80
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,259
Where are the bodies?

81
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,857
The ship's keeping him in stasis.

82
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,491
How do you know that?

83
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,528
Oh.

My name is Oliver Queen, and my preference
is to not break your arm.

87
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,807
So, I want you to calm down and tell us
what happened to your team.

88
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,182
You wouldn't believe me
even if I told you.

89
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,779
All I remember is being knocked out
by that skinny, little Englishman.

90
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,822
Very embarrassing.

91
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:18,072
I know that Sara told her father
she was leaving to protect history.

92
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,528
Why?

93
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,119
Why does history need protecting?

94
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:28,208
Because the idiots who were protecting it,
the Time Masters, were blown up.

95
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,214
- So, you and the Legends took over...
- Mmm.

Chasing down time criminals and fixing
the parts of history they screwed up.

97
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,057
Aberrations, the Captain called them.

98
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:44,725
We were chasing them for about six months
without a problem.

99

there will be no Louis <i>Quatorze,</i>

no Sun King, and no Golden Age of France.

117
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,787
As is yours. Who gave it to you?

00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,112
Shut your mouth, Jax,

159
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,576
or I'll cut your eyes out
and feed them to you.

160
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,082
I believe our work here is done.

161
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,171
Wait, how did you go from the court
of Louis XIII

162
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,805
to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean?

163
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,840
You said you wanted to hear
the full story.

164
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,261
We do. Just, some of us have lives
that we'd like to get back to.

165
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:59,183
We got ourselves in trouble
by visiting a time we were told not to.

166
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,110
- 1942?
- Mmm.

167
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,654
Who told you not to go to 1942?

168
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:09,614
Some guy in a hood named Rex Tyler.

169
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,701
Said if we set foot in 1942,
we'd be all screwed.

170
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,706
And then, he just vanished.

171
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,290
Okay, if he told you not to go to 1942,

172
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:20,920
then why did you go?

173
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,545
Put another successful mission
down in the books.

174
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,799
Where are we off to next?

175
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,212
Gideon and I have calculated
a 96% likelihood

176
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,881
of another Aberration in Bhopal, 1912.

177
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,141
Why can't it be Aruba, 2016?

178
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,802
For real. We've been going nonstop
for the past six months.

179
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,064
Nobody wants to address the fact
that Cardinal Richelieu's men were armed

180
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,223
with laser guns?

181
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,690
Clearly provided to them
by a time pirate or some such.

182
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,820
Grey's right. We need to find out who so...

183
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,981
You can get another chance
at destroying the very history

184
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,071
that you're supposed to be protecting?

185
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,034
Ah, I knew I forgot something.

186
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,911
The part where Rip tells us
everything that we did wrong.

187
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,324
As in seducing the Queen of France
just before she's supposed to conceive

188
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,083
the country's greatest hope
for the future?

189
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,415
- She seduced me.
- Or wrong, as in violating

190
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,752
our policy of not using superpowers
in front of people?

191
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,166
They had laser guns.

192
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,005
At least I didn't screw up this time.

193
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,300
(CLEARS THROAT)

194
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,343
Stealing is not screwing up.

195
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,979
<i>Another successful mission, Captain?</i>

196
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,516
Yes, well, it seems I don't share
our team's definition of success.

197
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,435
But let's see if our labors
came to a certain fruition, shall we?

198
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,945
Well, that was fun.

199
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,072
I'm in no mood for a lecture, Sara.

200
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,983
Too tired from dishing them out?

201
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,245
Replacing the Time Masters
is an enormous responsibility, Sara.

202
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,280
And one which, I fear,
our team is ill-equipped to...

203
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,329
Gideon, are we under attack?

204
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,582
GIDEON: <i>Negative. That was a shock wave
generated by a timequake.</i>

205
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:44,792
A what?

206
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,049
A disturbance in the temporal zone
caused by an unusually large Aberration.

207
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,085
You never mentioned a timequake before.

208
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,345
I have never experienced one before.
Gideon?

209
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,349
GIDEON: <i>The shock wave's point of origin
was New York City, 1942.</i>

210
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,177
That's not possible.

211
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,554
Wait. What wasn't possible?

212
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,107
What? (GRUNTS)

213
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:09,271
You said you and the Legends
discovered an Aberration in 1942.

214
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,484
What was it?

215
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,153
My guess is it involved Nazis.

216
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,527
You could say that.

217
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:19,448
The Krauts nuked New York City in 1942.

218
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,504
- Wow, someone just blew up New York.
- During World War II.

219
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,219
Think we can all guess
who that someone is.

220
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,177
Nazis. I hate Nazis.

221
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,309
Aided by some sort
of time-traveling ally, obviously.

222
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,932
Wait, does that mean
the Allied forces lost the war?

223
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,268
In which case,
why aren't we speaking German right now?

224
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,522
Because we're in the Temporal Zone.

225
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,776
And because it takes time
for the consequences of an Aberration,

226
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,108
even one as cataclysmic as this one,
to ripple throughout time.

227
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,989
So, how much time do we have to stop it?

228
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,115
Isn't traveling to that particular time

229
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,744
precisely what Rex Tyler
told us not to do?

230
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,654
Well, what's the alternative?

231
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,619
We let New York blow up?

232
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,125
It's not like there are Time Masters
left to stop it.

233
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,163
Ms. Lance is right.
We are history's last line of defense.

234
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,375
I like the sound of that.

235
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,632
I'd rather die than speak German.

236
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,379
(SIGHS)

237
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,010
Best-case scenario,
let's assume that Mr. Tyler is wrong

238
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,971
and we all end up not dying in 1942.

239
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:26,765
What if in endeavoring to save New York,
we make things worse?

240
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,356
What could be worse than a genocidal,
fascist, nuclear-armed superpower?

241
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,238
Relax, Captain.

242
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,023
We got this.

243
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:41,530
Gideon, I need you to pull up everything
you can on the target in 1942.

244
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,370
GIDEON: <i>I assume that by "target"
you mean Damien Darhk.</i>

245
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,661
You're finally getting the hang
of this whole revenge thing.

246
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,296
All right, so, we know
that he was alive during 1942,

247
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,833
so we just need to know where he is.

248
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:57,004
<i>According to a 1942 FBI file,
the target was spotted here.</i>

249
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,550
Hope I'm not interrupting.

250
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,435
No, just reading up on 1942.

251
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,852
You've been spending a lot of time
down here lately, alone.

252
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,438
Am I not allowed in the library?

253
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,232
Nah, you just never struck me
as a bookworm.

254
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,075
I'm just making sure that
you're not holding on to anything.

255
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,035
I know a thing or two about grief,

256
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,411
so, if you ever want to talk
about Laurel...

257
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,665
Then I know where to find you. Thank you.

258
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,162
Ms. Lance.

259
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,957
Any luck pinpointing the epicenter
of the temporal Aberration?

260
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,376
- No.
- GIDEON: <i>Perhaps these news reports</i>

261
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,543
<i>will prove useful.</i>

262
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,052
Well, that's good news.

263
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,590
Even though we get nuked,
we still win the war.

264
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,554
Look at the date, Dr. Palmer.

265
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,891
In this version of history,
World War II lasts two more years.

266
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,897
And claims 12 million more lives.

267
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,979
RAY: <i>Including Albert Einstein.</i>
GIDEON: <i>Actually,</i>

268
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,145
<i>Einstein went missing
just prior to the attack on New York.</i>

269
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,155
(STUTTERS) Wait.

270
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:03,320
Perhaps these two events
aren't merely coincidental.

271
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,410
Think about it. A Nobel Prize-winning
physicist goes missing...

272
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,371
And miraculously the Germans
get the bomb three years ahead of us.

273
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:13,004
They must have kidnapped Einstein,
forced him to build them an A-bomb,

274
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:17,838
which means the only way
for us to fix the Aberration...

275
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,591
- Is for us to kidnap him first!
- Yes!

276
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,133
Gideon, please
chart a course for New York City, 1942.

277
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,643
On, my God. (PANTING)

278
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:32,432
I can't believe
I'm going to meet Albert Einstein.

279
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,439
I can't believe
you're making me stay on the ship.

280
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,071
I am asking you
to stay on the ship, Mr. Jackson.

281
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,613
While the rest of you
get to have all the fun battling Nazis.

282
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,200
You're the only one that I trust to give
the time drive a long-overdue tune-up.

283
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,036
And build the time library?
And modify the bridge?

284
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,292
And half the other 100 things
you've been getting me to do.

285
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,374
- All right. Give me your tools, then.
- What?

286
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,129
Pack up our tools and give them to me.

287
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,505
Why would I do that?

288
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:00,294
I'm going to go and give 'em to Mr. Rory,
see if he wants to be the ship's mechanic.

289
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,133
- You see, that's not funny.
- Quite right.

290
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,390
Because in the event
that we can't stop this nuclear explosion,

291
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,893
a fully functioning time drive
is going to come in handy.

292
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,388
(SIGHS)

293
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,399
So, how do we find Einstein
in a city of seven million people?

294
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,364
Why don't we just look for the physicist
with the crazy, white hair?

295
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,495
- I mean, the other one.
- According to Gideon,

296
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,246
there's a cocktail party
at Columbia this evening.

297
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,874
Cocktail party, that means booze.
Where is it?

298
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,957
At Columbia, I just...
Why does no one ever listen to me?

299
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,919
Hey, where are you going?

300
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,711
I have a grandfather that's in the FBI.
I figured I'd check in.

301
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,220
<i>In case we need backup.</i>

302
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,425
Oh, good plan.

303
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,551
Hey!

304
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,268
Where do you think you're going?

305
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,771
Follow Sara. In case she needs backup.

306
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,231
Oh, God.

307
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,728
(WHISTLES)

308
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,527

Never been to a nerd party before.

I am merely demonstrating

Shut your mouth, Ray.

Who are you?

340
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,674
My colleague and I were just having
a rather spirited debate

341
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,211
about your theory of relativity,
perhaps you could help us settle it?

342
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:35,137
I was this close to getting them both
to come back to my room.

343
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,393
What about your wife?

who divorced me 30 years ago?

So what?

349
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,966
Even Einstein can't build a bomb
without fuel.

350
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,502
Darhk must be the one supplying the Nazis.

351
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:14,013
Damien Darhk murdered my sister in 2016.

352
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,720
If I take him out here in 1942...

353
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,883
You save her.

354
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,803
I've been waiting six months
to get this son of a bitch.

that you're really a physicist?

367
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,140
Because for every action,

(GRUNTS)

369
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,141
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

Yeah. He's sleeping it off in the brig.

There's just so much
I'd like to discuss with you,

391
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,598
such as your paper
on unified field theory.

No. Not even a man as mad as Adolf Hitler

397
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,149
would want to create
such a terrible weapon.

398

You yourself once said
that two things are infinite,

399
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,989
the universe and human stupidity.

400
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,783

The least you could do
is help us save New York.

406
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,972
From what? (CHUCKLES)

00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:28,329
how the Germans managed
to create a nuclear bomb...

415
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,333
- Atomic.
- When you are the only man

416
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,245
on Earth capable
of performing such a feat.

417
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:36,923
Yeah.

418
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,883
That is correct. I am the only man.

Wait a minute.

Why am I talking to him when you are

00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,776
Your ex-wife is also a physicist.

Without Mileva's help,

425
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:02,366
I would still be working
as a patent clerk in Vienna.

426
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,872
So, while we were busy safeguarding
Professor Einstein...

427
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,953
The Nazis were busy kidnapping his ex.

428
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,210
Her name is Mileva Maric.
She's a fellow nuclear physicist.

429
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,212
Who, let me guess,
had no one guarding her?

430
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,211
Yes. Einstein's collaborations
with Ms. Maric

431
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,468
were a closely-guarded secret
between the two of them.

432
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,378
A secret that the Germans apparently knew.

433
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,798
So, unless we can determine
where they're keeping her

434
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,387
<i>while she manufactures their bomb...</i>

435
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,393
If I had to guess?
I'd say she's with Damien Darhk's uranium.

436
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,221
Damien Darhk, as in...

437
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,935
The man who murdered your sister.

438
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,978
How is Damien Darhk even alive in 1942?

439
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,441
Thanks to the Lazarus Pit, he hardly ages.

440
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,815
Sara's kind of an expert on Damien Darhk.

441
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,076
- Drop it, Ray.
- I'm sorry.

442
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,736
But, while you were all saving Einstein,

443
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,404
Sara was off
on her own secret side-mission

444
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,822
<i>to kill Laurel's killer in the past.</i>

445
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,583
And I suppose you never thought
about saving your fiancée?

446
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,742
Yeah, of course, I did.

447
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,411
But I never did it
because it's against the rules.

448
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,296
What rules? We're not Time Masters.
There are no rules.

449
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,083
Well, if there were, there'd
certainly be one about lying to your team.

450
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,345
Listen to yourself.
Look, we get it, you're perfect.

451
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,756
Always the boy scout, aren't you, Raymond?

452
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,266
Yeah, well, I could say the same thing
about you being an assassin.

453
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,099
Well, if we're being honest,

454
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,854
then let me get something off of my chest.

455
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,310
Let's all just take a deep breath,
shall we?

456
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,316
You think that you're
such a big hero, Ray?

457
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:22,275
Without that fancy suit, you're nothing
but a self-righteous rich guy.

458
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,111
Maybe you're right.

459
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,702
But without my suit, there's no way
of finding Einstein's ex-wife,

460
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,158
or Damien Darhk, for that matter.

461
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,118
Sorry, what are you saying?

462
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,122
That anyone who spends a lot of time
around uranium,

463
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:38,458
in this case, Damien Darhk,
picks up trace amounts of radiation.

464
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,959
Which my suit can track.

465
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:45,511

But the Nazis still have the nuke.
What are we doing leaving New York?

513
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,521
Because the Nazis still have a nuke.
Which we saw being loaded onto a U-boat.

They're gonna hit New York
from underwater.

Yeah, I'm tracking the uranium signature

I'm a time traveler, Jefferson.

00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:11,689
I spend most of my time

might not involve me
being aboard this ship.

And I need someone to know its secrets
in my absence.

00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,184
Bring me my wizards!

627
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,356
My Liege,

628
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,646
how may we entertain you?

629
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:32,862
Do you wish to gaze into my magic mirror,
Your Majesty?

630
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,486
I grow bored of your tricks.

631
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,495
Off with their heads!

632
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,282
- What?
- You little brat!

633
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,542
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>This is incredible.</i>

634
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,870
An actual medieval execution?

635
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,623
I never imagined I'd see this
with my own eyes.

636
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:48,790
Who's that?

637
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,166
The new guy.

638
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,585
New guy, duck!

639
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,799
(GRUNTING)

640
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,427
I'm Dr. Heywood.
I heard so much about you.

641
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,341
How about we get to know each other
back on the ship?

642
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,181
- DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Okay.</i>
- But first we have to find Sara.

643
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,345
MAN: <i>Vile witch!</i>

644
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,977
You have corrupted the women
of our village!

645
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,643
In my defense,
they were happily corrupted.

646
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:15,276
ALL: Hang the witch! Hang the witch!
Hang the witch! Hang the witch!

647
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:19,325
You must be Sara Lance.

648
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,454
Whoa, whoa! It's okay. He's with us.

649
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:25,744
Hey.

650
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,329
Is she always this violent?

651
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:32,258
I'm sorry, but so far,
I haven't been able to detect

652
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:38,174
any historical alteration that would
indicate Mr. Hunter was stranded in time.

653
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:40,968
Why don't we ask Gideon where he is?

654
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,385
Who's Gideon?

655
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,479
<i>Greetings, Dr. Heywood.</i>

656
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,639
<i>I am the ship's artificial consciousness.</i>

657
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,605
Gideon, we need you to tell us
where Rip is.

658
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,736
<i>I'm afraid I have no idea.</i>

659
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:55,024
<i>But I would be happy to play
his final message for you all.</i>

660
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,029
Final message?

661
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,528
RIP: <i>Sorry for stranding you all
throughout history,</i>

662
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,367
<i>but it was the only way to save you.</i>

663
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,912
<i>You know what they say,</i>

664
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,042
<i>a captain must never abandon his ship.</i>

665
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:12,499
<i>Well, neither shall I abandon hope
of seeing you all again someday.</i>

666
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,543
<i>Somewhere in time.</i>

667
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,171
<i>As flawed and unruly
as you are individually,</i>

668
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:18,589
<i>together you are the best crew,</i>

669
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:22,225
<i>the best team a captain
could ever hope for.</i>

670
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:25,766
<i>So</i>

671
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,561
<i>stick together.</i>

672
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,692
<i>And remember,</i>

673
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,109
<i>history is yours now, my dear Legends.</i>

674
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,787
<i>Good luck.</i>

675
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,372
So, what do we do now?

676
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,711
We drink.

677
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:57,173
It's not like we were exactly Time Masters
even with Rip.

678
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,965
But I think he knew that one day
we might have to do this without him.

679
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,178
And we all heard his message,
he wanted us to keep going.

680
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,342
We have to keep going.

681
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,477
There's a rogue time traveler
out there somewhere.

682
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,934
Yeah, a time nemesis whose idea of fun

683
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:12,271
is helping Damien Darhk and the Nazis
blow up New York City.

684
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,611
What's to stop them
from going back in time

685
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,316
and kidnapping Einstein
and his ex-wife again?

686
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,901
We can't be everywhere at once.

687
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,112
But you can safeguard the Einsteins.

688
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,743
Safeguard the Einsteins?

689
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:24,658
How?

690
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,368
By making one slight alteration
to history.

691
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,168
We'd like to talk to Mr. Einstein.

692
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,754
- CIA.
- He means OSS.

693
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,011
This is related to the Manhattan Project.

694
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,513
You're headed to Columbia University,
right? For the symphony?

695
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:43,969
- Symposium.
- Same thing.

696
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,055
<i>Once you're there, we're gonna
need you to publicly announce</i>

697
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,141
that Ms. Mileva Maric has been
your silent partner for over 30 years.

698
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,147
<i>You see, acknowledgment
of Mileva's contributions</i>

699
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,649
is the only way to keep her safe.

700
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:56,152
Besides, it's the right thing to do.
Don't be a jerk.

701
00:39:57,145 --> 00:40:01,821
Today, I want to tell you
about a very special woman,

702
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,528
<i>my longtime collaborator,</i>

703
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,537
Mileva Maric.

704
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,744
(ALL APPLAUDING)

705
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,707
What does that mean?
The Krauts won't be able to get to her?

706
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:18,000
Yes. And then people won't say,
"Hey, you're a regular Einstein."

707
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,136
They'll say,
"You're like one of the Einsteins."

708
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,384
- Hmm.
- That's so crazy.

709
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:26,095
I can't believe we just changed history.

710
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,267
No, Dr. Heywood,

711
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,054
we saved it.

712
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,645
You promised no trouble, <i>Herr</i> Darhk.

713
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,815
And you promised me competency.

714
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,359
Perhaps we'll have better luck
with the next bomb.

715
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,161
That's cute,
but there won't be a next bomb.

716
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,244
You see, my partner wants to
move on to other things.

717
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,122
But your partner isn't here, is he?

718
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,802
According to who?

719
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,346
Hello, Eobard.

720
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,932
Mr. Darhk.

721
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,354
- Ah. How'd it go with Einstein?
- <i>Good.</i>

722
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:19,940
Until someone gives
the Confederate Army machine guns

723
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,776
or breaks Mozart's fingers...

724
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,940
One Aberration at a time.

725
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:26,360
Hey, you remember that thing
that I said before

726
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:27,823
about you being a...

727
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:31,035
A billionaire boy scout?
You weren't all wrong.

728
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,325
Yeah, but you're more than that.

729
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,623
Thanks.

730
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,798
And we'll get justice for Laurel, Sara.
I promise.

731
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,879
What do you guys say we get out of 1942?

732
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,467
(GUN COCKS)

733
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,848
Not until you answer a few questions.

734
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,426
We're the Justice Society of America.

735
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,720
And you're coming with us.
