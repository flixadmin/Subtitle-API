You tell us to stay out

- Subtle.
- We have reason to believe

337
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,198
your father met with Xander Wilde.

338
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,376
Well, if he did, he certainly
would have made a note of it.

339
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,736
What was the name
of that building again?

340
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Wayne Plaza.

341
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,995
He was a meticulous note taker, Thomas.

342
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,238
He organized everything by project.

343
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,433
Let's see. Wayne Gardens...

Aha, here we go, Wayne Plaza.

346
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,269
AII right.

347
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,951
Why, you're bang on the money
there, Captain.

348
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,352
Xander Wilde. Says he went
to meet him to finalize the plans.

349
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,398
No address, just the name
of the street, Ainslie Drive.

350
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,911
It's out past Buxton
by the old rock quarry.

351

BRUCE: This man
must've been very important

352
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,593
if my father went out of his way
to meet him alone.

353
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,792
I'm starting to think he isn'tjust
some recluse hiding from the world.

354
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,350
He's hiding from Jerome.

How long has he lived here?

There's two of them.

May I put my hands down now, gentlemen?

Please?

392
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,679
Apologies. Mr. Wilde,
you took us by surprise.

393
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,319
It's understandable.
You can call me Jeremiah.

394
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,991
That's name my mother gave me.

395
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,874
You solved her murder,

396
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,600
and Captain Gordon, I owe you
a debt of gratitude for that.

397
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,071
And for putting Jerome in Arkham.
Where he belongs.

398
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,631
He never mentioned you before.

399
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,030
No, I suppose you wouldn't know
from the letters my mother sent me,

400
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,191
he never spoke of me after I left.

401
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,074
Left where?

402
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,869
The Circus.

403
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,595
They hid me away to protect me from him.

404
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,236
See, we are always different,
Jerome and I.

405
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,552
From an early age, I showed
a proficiency for maths and design

406
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,154
and Jerome, mainly the mutilation
of alley cats.

407
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,358
On my 10th birthday,
he held a cake knife to my throat.

408
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,791
A few weeks later,
he lit my bed on fire.

409
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,712
It was like living in a nightmare.

410
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,839
My mother knew, eventually,
one day he would succeed, so...

411
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,716
One night, my uncle came to my room
while Jerome slept

412
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,918
and told me that he was taking me away.

413
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,159
I had no idea where,

414
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,998
but I kissed my mother goodbye,

415
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,995
told her I love her,
and I never saw her again.

416
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,672
He took you to St. Ignatius.

417
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,591
Got a new name, new life, where Iwas
finally able to live without fear.

418
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,276
But in my heart.

419
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,318
I knew one day Jerome would come for me.

420
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,798
Well, that day is today, pops.

421
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,000
GORDON: We have reason to believe
Jerome knows where you are.

422
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,673
We need to move you to a safe location

423
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,989
until we can apprehend him.

424
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,559
That won't be necessary, gentlemen.

425
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,080
I've spent the bulk of my life
preparing for this eventuality.

426
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,555
I am safest here in my home.

427
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,911
Not anymore.
Jerome knows the name of your proxy.

428
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,310
He got it from your boss
just before he executed him.

429
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,955
I heard about Jerome
visiting Alan Hayes.

430
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,755
It's tragic.

431
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,792
But the proxy's name
I gave to Alan was a fake.

432
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,475
You're lying.

There's something about this guy
that's fishy.

435

Security cameras outside were turned on,

436
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,278
so why are the monitors in here off?

I don't see why
that is any of your concern.

(COUGHING)

655
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,076
I thought I was going to be
stuck like this forever.

656
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,189
You don't have to be, friend.

657
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,794
Okay. I'II join you.

658
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,552
But you'd better deliver.

659
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,914
And I'm not your friend.

660
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,993
I can live with those terms.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

662
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,834
Why did you open your club
in The Narrows?

663
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,270
You could've set up shop
anywhere in Gotham.

664
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,189
You wanted my attention.

665
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,955
I came back here
because the people love me.

666
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,077
People didn't come here
because they love you, Ed.

667
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,554
They came for the money.

668
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,596
But I can give them what they want.
Ijust need your help.

669
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,319
Why would I help you?

670
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,154
Because I know what you really want.

671
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,954
You love me.

672
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,360
You've loved me all along.

673
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,234
You're wrong.

674
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,234
That was Ed.

675
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,035
Okay.

676
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,035
So, do it.

677
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,394

you've robbed in one day?

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,959
Three. Why?

681
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,994
I think you can do better.

00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,798
You're playing a dangerous game. Lee.

683

- Captain.
- It's okay.

687
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,838
This is Jeremiah Valeska,
Jerome's twin brother.

688
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,518
We need to put him
into protective custody.

689
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,791
Okay. Follow me.

690
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,675
Thank you.

691

GORDON: Jerome told his brother
his plan was to turn Gotham mad.

How the hell
is he going to do that. Harvey?

The test subject has arrived.

Hmm.

709
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,830
A little large for a test subject.
Don't you think?

He is not your test subject.
This is Grundy.
