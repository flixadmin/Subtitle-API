demonstrates healthy self-protection.

And more importantly,

368
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,843
I remember how hard it was
for you to share something like this.

369
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,347

when I say that I'm so, so excited

379
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,763
to be working on a game
that was such a, well, game changer.

380
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:13,726
Now, the packet in front of you
has our focus group research.

Inside, you'll find the breakdown,

382
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:18,398
including key word association
with the brand.

383
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:21,609
The top two
being "originality" and "fresh,"

384
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,653
which I think are great things
to keep in mind

385
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,905
as you begin working on matrix 4.

386
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,033

- Trans-politics.
- Crypto-fascism.

416
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:13,554
It's a metaphor...

How do you know
if you want something yourself

or if your upbringing
programmed you to want it?

01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:16,343
A few more wrinkles
and a few less teeth,

1090
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:20,847
but wise enough to know
I don't know anything.

1091
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:23,517
I sure as shit never saw this coming.

1092
01:08:24,393 --> 01:08:25,477
Neither did I.

1093
01:08:25,644 --> 01:08:26,770
I told you he was alive.

1094
01:08:26,937 --> 01:08:29,064
Captain, you and your crew
have been grounded.

1095
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:30,667
General, if you'd just let me explain.

1096
01:08:30,691 --> 01:08:33,485
The protocols are put in place
for everyone's protection.

1097
01:08:33,652 --> 01:08:36,947
I'm sorry. I saw an opportunity
and I was afraid we'd lose him.

1098
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:39,658
But, general,
people have been waiting for so long.

1099
01:08:41,368 --> 01:08:42,577
We found the one.

1100
01:08:44,496 --> 01:08:46,123
I don't believe in the one.

1101
01:08:48,417 --> 01:08:49,501
I never did.

1102
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:53,714
Me neither.

1103
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:58,593
But there was a time
when you trusted me with your ship,

1104
01:08:59,303 --> 01:09:01,013
against the council's orders.

1105
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:03,140
The world was different then.

1106
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,601
We were different.

1107
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:10,063
Report to the docks.

1108
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:11,857
Scrub down the mnemosyne.

1109
01:09:12,024 --> 01:09:14,192
Transfer your access codes.

1110
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:15,777
You are done, captain.

1111
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:16,862
[Gasps softly]

1112
01:09:25,454 --> 01:09:27,247
We need to talk.

1113
01:09:32,544 --> 01:09:34,713
[Niobe] When word first came,

1114
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:37,466
that it actually might be you,

1115
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:45,015
I didn't know how I would feel
in this moment.

1116
01:09:52,981 --> 01:09:54,941
It is nice to see you.

1117
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,652
- It's good to see you too.
- [Glasses clink]

1118
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,370
A long way from dozer's paint stripper.

1119
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:08,872
[Chuckles] Yes.

1120
01:10:09,498 --> 01:10:11,166
A lot has changed.

1121
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:14,628
Except maybe you.

1122
01:10:17,506 --> 01:10:18,965
You remember this?

1123
01:10:26,223 --> 01:10:30,769
It's so easy to forget how much noise
the matrix pumps into your head

1124
01:10:30,936 --> 01:10:32,312
until you unplug.

1125
01:10:32,813 --> 01:10:34,064
[Neo sighs]

1126
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:35,190
Yeah.

1127
01:10:35,816 --> 01:10:38,568
Something else
makes the same kind of noise.

1128
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,821
Takes over every damn thing

1129
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,614
just like the matrix.

1130
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:45,283
War.

1131
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,621
I stood at the barricade of the temple.

1132
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,708
Staring at the army of sentinels,

1133
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,462
waiting for them to kill
every one of us.

1134
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:02,008
But then, they left.

1135
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:05,637
They said you saved us.

1136
01:11:05,804 --> 01:11:07,013
I didn't believe it.

1137
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:10,350
Every night I would dream
of attack sirens.

1138
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,269
But then,

1139
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:17,065
I would wake up to this...

1140
01:11:21,069 --> 01:11:22,529
Shence.

1141
01:11:26,074 --> 01:11:27,659
I'm ashamed of it now.

1142
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:31,705
My pessimism
of how long it took me to believe

1143
01:11:31,872 --> 01:11:34,958
a world without war was possible.

1144
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:37,961
You gave me that.

1145
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:40,881
You gave that gift to us all.

1146
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:45,093
And it is the gift
that continues to bear fruit.

1147
01:11:47,888 --> 01:11:49,556
Come help me get up.

1148
01:11:49,723 --> 01:11:51,349
Let's take a walk.

1149
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:54,686
[Mysterious music playing]

1150
01:12:04,446 --> 01:12:05,906
[Elevator door opens]

1151
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,501
Oh! Beautiful.

1152
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:21,671
This is Freya, head of botany.

1153
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:24,841
And this is quillion,
our lead digitologist.

1154
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:29,095
I presume
our guest needs no introduction.

1155
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:31,723
Nothing travels faster than light.

1156
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:33,141
Except gossip.

1157
01:12:33,225 --> 01:12:34,226
[Freya chuckles]

1158
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,895
Welcome to the garden, Neo.

1159
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,190
A strawberry?

1160
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:44,361
Using digital code from the matrix,
we retro-convert it into DNA sequences.

1161
01:12:44,528 --> 01:12:45,987
And they grow here?

1162
01:12:46,154 --> 01:12:50,325
It's not easy augmenting the genome
to photosynthesize bio-sky, but...

1163
01:12:50,492 --> 01:12:52,077
- We're getting there.
- [Chuckles]

1164
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,538
Go ahead. Try it.

1165
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,003
[Niobe chuckles]

1166
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:04,339
We're quite excited
about the blueberries.

1167
01:13:04,506 --> 01:13:06,299
You remember that shit we used to eat?

1168
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:08,718
That slop that tasted like rust.

1169
01:13:10,512 --> 01:13:13,848
Zion could have never
made something like this.

1170
01:13:15,809 --> 01:13:18,061
Because we needed synthients

1171
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:20,480
and di like him.

1172
01:13:20,647 --> 01:13:23,858
Zion was stuck in the past.
Stuck in war.

1173
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:26,069
Stuck in a matrix of its own.

1174
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:30,240
They believed
that it had to be us or them.

1175
01:13:30,407 --> 01:13:33,243
This city was built by us

1176
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:35,078
and them.

1177
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:42,419
What happened to Zion?

1178
01:13:42,586 --> 01:13:45,797
I've been waiting
for you to ask that question.

1179
01:13:48,008 --> 01:13:51,344
All of the troubles
started in the machine cities.

1180
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:54,764
Power plants were unable
to produce enough energy.

1181
01:13:55,307 --> 01:13:58,852
Nothing can breed violence
like scarcity.

1182
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:02,272
For the first time,

1183
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:05,483
we saw machines at war with one another.

1184
01:14:08,737 --> 01:14:12,490
We got word from the oracle
of a new power rising.

1185
01:14:14,618 --> 01:14:17,120
That was the last we heard from her.

1186
01:14:20,832 --> 01:14:22,000
Morpheus.

1187
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:26,630
[Niobe] After the siege,
he was elected unanimously.

1188
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,798
High chair of the council.

1189
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:32,802
Oh, how he loved that. [Scoffs]

1190
01:14:33,345 --> 01:14:37,349
But as rumors of this new power spread,

1191
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:38,725
he ignored them.

1192
01:14:38,892 --> 01:14:43,271
He was certain what you had done
could not be undone.

1193
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:47,609
All of these people
never stopped believing in miracles,

1194
01:14:47,776 --> 01:14:50,111
believing in you.

1195
01:15:02,207 --> 01:15:03,541
I'm sorry.

1196
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:07,921
How could I know this would happen?

1197
01:15:08,088 --> 01:15:10,173
We didn't understand
all of it back then.

1198
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,966
No more than we do now.

1199
01:15:12,384 --> 01:15:15,470
I didn't come here
to cause you problems, niobe,

1200
01:15:16,596 --> 01:15:18,264
but I need your help.

1201
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:21,434
Trinity is alive.

1202
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:23,228
Then there is another question.

1203
01:15:23,395 --> 01:15:25,063
Why did they keep her alive?

1204
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:26,439
I can't answer that.

1205
01:15:26,606 --> 01:15:29,818
But if there's a chance I can free her,

1206
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:31,653
I have to try.

1207
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:35,490
Even if it means
endangering everyone in this city?

1208
01:15:39,786 --> 01:15:41,121
I'm sorry, Neo.

1209
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:45,208
I won't let what happened to Zion
happentolo.

1210
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:50,839
I hope you'll forgive an old woman
for asking you to go with Sheperd here,

1211
01:15:51,798 --> 01:15:54,259
till we have better understanding
of what's going on.

1212
01:15:54,926 --> 01:15:57,762
You're going to imprison me
after I just got free?

1213
01:15:57,929 --> 01:16:00,807
I know it doesn't seem fair,

1214
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:03,810
but neither does growing old.

1215
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:06,730
But you don't hear me complaining.

1216

[Elevator whirring]

1217
01:16:18,742 --> 01:16:19,826
Sorry.

"Real."

There's that word again.

about the old days.

1226

About you, the viral agent.

1227

The siege of Zion.

1228

Everything was simpler back then.

1229

1230
01:16:59,324 --> 01:17:00,617
It's different now.

This is not independence of mind.

Why are you here now?

1642

Neo's escape
has destabilized the matrix.

1643

The anomaleum draws its current
from Trinity alone now.

A fail-safe has been triggered to reset
the matrix back to the previous version.

But the analyst halted the reset.

1646

He's convinced the authorities
that you will soon return voluntarily.

1647
01:42:57,964 --> 01:42:59,341
And why would he say that?

1648
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:02,927
Because if I don't go back,
he'll kill Trinity.

1652
01:43:13,438 --> 01:43:14,689
I'll go back.

1653
01:43:16,566 --> 01:43:18,735
Well, the analyst knows you well,

1654
01:43:18,902 --> 01:43:21,404
but that knowledge
has made him incautious.

1655

After you escaped,

1656
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:25,658
he should have accepted his losses
and devacuated Trinity.

1657
01:43:26,493 --> 01:43:29,079

this extraordinary opportunity

[Grunting]

1975
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:02,832
I'm not doing this.

1976
02:12:03,374 --> 02:12:04,667
Are you doing this?

Bye.

[Suspenseful music playing]

1984
02:13:50,940 --> 02:13:52,483
How dramatic.

1985
02:13:53,318 --> 02:13:54,402
"Tiffany"?

1986
02:13:54,819 --> 02:13:57,655
[Chuckles] It was a private joke.

1987
02:13:57,822 --> 02:13:59,282
An amusement, that's all.

1988
02:13:59,449 --> 02:14:01,534
An amusement? Hmm.

1989
02:14:01,826 --> 02:14:02,869
[Flesh tears]

1990
02:14:03,578 --> 02:14:05,580

- [Groaning]

1991
02:14:05,747 --> 02:14:07,123
Kind of like that?

Okay. Ow.

1995
02:14:14,339 --> 02:14:16,424
If you hated the name so much,
why did you heel

1996
02:14:16,549 --> 02:14:18,051
like a good little bitch so long?

[Groaning]

2003
02:14:36,486 --> 02:14:38,112
That was for using children.

2004
02:14:43,076 --> 02:14:44,577
We have a few questions.

2005
02:14:44,744 --> 02:14:47,914
- You tried to activate the fail-safe.
- The suits tried.

2006
02:14:48,081 --> 02:14:50,250
Obviously, without control
of your source code,

2007
02:14:50,416 --> 02:14:51,751
I knew that was impossible.

2008
02:14:51,918 --> 02:14:53,962
So, why haven't the suits purged you?

2009
02:14:54,921 --> 02:14:56,798
Because I know the system.

2010
02:14:57,632 --> 02:14:59,384
I know human beings.

2011
02:15:00,134 --> 02:15:01,636
And I know you.

[Bones crack, sighs]

2013
02:15:04,931 --> 02:15:07,308
Right now, you're feeling good
about what you've done.

2014
02:15:07,475 --> 02:15:09,727
You should. It was a victory. Bravo.

2015
02:15:10,561 --> 02:15:11,896
Now what?

2016
02:15:12,063 --> 02:15:14,691
You've come here
to negotiate some kind of deal?

2017
02:15:14,857 --> 02:15:16,276
You think you hold all the cards

2018
02:15:16,442 --> 02:15:18,736
because you can do
whatever you want in this world.

2019
02:15:18,903 --> 02:15:21,239
I say, go for it.

2020
02:15:21,406 --> 02:15:23,908
Remake it. Knock yourselves out.

2021
02:15:24,075 --> 02:15:25,994
Paint the sky with rainbows.

2022
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:27,287
But here's the thing.

2023
02:15:27,453 --> 02:15:30,331
The sheeple aren't going anywhere.

2024
02:15:30,498 --> 02:15:31,749
They like my world.

2025
02:15:31,916 --> 02:15:34,752
They don't want this sentimentality.

2026
02:15:34,919 --> 02:15:36,671
They don't want freedom or empowerment.

2027
02:15:36,838 --> 02:15:39,215
They want to be controlled.

2028
02:15:39,382 --> 02:15:41,342
They crave the comfort of certainty.

2029
02:15:41,509 --> 02:15:44,178
And that means you two,
back in your pods,

2030
02:15:44,345 --> 02:15:47,682
unconscious and alone, just like them.

2031
02:15:49,642 --> 02:15:51,269
[Both chuckle]

2032
02:15:52,103 --> 02:15:54,731
We're not here to negotiate anything.

2033
02:15:54,897 --> 02:15:56,983
We were on our way to remake your world.

2034
02:15:57,150 --> 02:15:58,568
Change a few things.

2035
02:15:58,735 --> 02:16:01,112
I kind of like the
"paint the sky with rainbows" idea.

2036
02:16:01,195 --> 02:16:03,364
Just remind people
what a free mind can do.

2037
02:16:03,531 --> 02:16:04,991
I forgot. It's easy to forget.

2038
02:16:05,158 --> 02:16:07,493
- He makes it easy.
- That, he does.

2039
02:16:07,660 --> 02:16:09,704
Something he should think about.

2040
02:16:10,788 --> 02:16:14,334
Before we got started,
we decided to stop by to say thank you.

2041
02:16:15,168 --> 02:16:17,962
You gave us something
we never thought we could have.

2042
02:16:18,129 --> 02:16:19,464
And what is that?

2043
02:16:20,381 --> 02:16:21,966
Another chance.

[Punk rock music playing]

2045
02:27:25,546 --> 02:27:28,132
Face reality, people. Movies are dead.

2046
02:27:28,298 --> 02:27:30,134
Games are dead.

2047
02:27:30,300 --> 02:27:32,094
Narrative? Dead.

2048
02:27:32,261 --> 02:27:34,138
Media is nothing
but neuro-trigger response

2049
02:27:34,221 --> 02:27:35,222
and viral conditioning.

2050
02:27:35,389 --> 02:27:36,932
Wait, what are you two talking about?

2051
02:27:39,226 --> 02:27:40,394
Cat videos.

2052
02:27:41,270 --> 02:27:44,857
What we need is a series of videos

2053
02:27:45,024 --> 02:27:47,276
that we call "the catrix."
