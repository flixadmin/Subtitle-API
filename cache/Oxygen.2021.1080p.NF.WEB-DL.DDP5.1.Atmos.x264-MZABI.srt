195
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:27,125
<i>Liz? No, Liz, focus.
It's important. What's your oxygen level?</i>

196
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,708
I'm at 31%.

Tell me.

- <i>Who are you?</i>
- Excuse me.

316

You have to put Léo on,
please, it's urgent.

317

Okay, how does it open?

327
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:55,375
No, it's not real.

328
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,875
There's no rat.

329

<i>- Would you like a sedative?</i>
- No.

332

Yes.

<i>Got her. Liz, listen. We have
the subpoena. My men are at Cryosalide.</i>

350
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:43,916
You have the codes?

351

<i>Yes, we'll get them shortly.</i>

<i>- We've got you.</i>

Captain Moreau?

- Moreau?
<i>- It's going to be okay.</i>

356
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:00,458
There's a problem, right?

357
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,708
Tell me what's going on.

359
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:09,000
Seventeen percent? But I was at 20%.

360
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:11,000
<i>What's happening? Talk to me.</i>

361
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,708
I don't know. I'm losing track of time.

362
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:15,541
I see images. I see things.

363
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:18,000
<i>No, Liz. Listen to me carefully.</i>

<i>What? No, we were cut off.
I didn't move.</i>

369

<i>Liz, pull yourself together.</i>

<i>Focus on what you know is real.</i>

Okay, okay, okay.

<i>Liz?</i>

379
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,250
<i>Liz, talk to me.</i>

380
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:34,166
Are you sure you want to do it?

381
00:40:35,791 --> 00:40:36,791
Yeah.

382
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:41,041
<i>Hello, Liz?</i>

<i>Intravenous antibiotic administered

<i>Antibiotics? Why, Liz?
What did you do?</i>

386
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,500
I focused on what's real.

387
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:06,125
How long have I been missing?

388
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,750
<i>You were active on social media
a few days ago.</i>

389

<i>And no one has reported you missing.</i>

390
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:14,250
I have a husband. Léo.

391
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:17,791
And I think we were trying to have kids.

392
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:21,041
- <i>Léo?</i>
- Yes.

393
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:26,250
What? Who are you talking to?

394
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:28,375
- <i>No one.</i>
- Is it about Léo?

395
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:29,458
- <i>No.</i>
- Huh?

396
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:31,958
Is he well?

397
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:35,291
Find Léo. He'll know what happened.

398
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:39,291
<i>Listen. According to
our information, you were never married.</i>

399
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:40,833
What?

400
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,166
No, no, no.

401
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,833
We were trying to have kids.

402
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:51,208
MILO, search for Dr. Léo Ferguson.

403

What?

405
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,708
That's not possible. It's not.

406
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:57,958
He was there. No, that's not possible.

407

RESULTS FOR "FERGUSON"

408
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,708
That's not possible.

409
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:05,500
MILO, search for Dr. Elizabeth Hansen
at the Science and Technology Awards.

410
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:07,333
No.

411
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,750
No…

412
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:12,333
- <i>Elizabeth.</i>
- No.

413
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:14,625
That's impossible.
We were both in the photo.

414
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:17,125
We were together. He was there.

415
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:20,250
I called him. Someone answered.

416
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,291
A woman. She knew him.

417
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:23,958
- <i>What woman?</i>
- A woman...

418
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,416
<i>What did you say to her?</i>

419
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,708
Nothing. She hung up.

420
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:27,958
She knew him.

421
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,250
She knew him. She knew Léo.

422
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:32,708
<i>No, she wasn't real.</i>

423
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
What's going on?

424
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:38,833
<i>Liz, listen to me.
Léo isn't real either.</i>

425
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:42,583
- He was real.
<i>- Yes, I know.</i>

426
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:44,416
<i>I know you're convinced of it.</i>

427
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,958
<i>Your mind's playing tricks on you,
that's all.</i>

428
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:50,083
<i>To help you to keep going.
You have to trust me, I'll get you out.</i>

429
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:51,333
You're lying to me.

430
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:53,000
<i>You played basketball.</i>

431
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,500
What?

432
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,333
<i>At college. You were gifted.</i>

433
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:02,083
<i>I thought you'd like
to hear something about yourself</i>

434
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:04,375
<i>and during my search, that struck me.</i>

435
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,708
Basketball?

436
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:09,791
<i>Yes.</i>

437
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:11,958
<i>It stood out from the rest.</i>

438
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:15,166
<i>Doctorate in bio-engineering,
grants, awards.</i>

439
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,583
<i>You are impressive.</i>

440
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:21,291
<i>Does it ring a bell?</i>

441
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:23,500
No.

442
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:25,416
<i>You were born in Stockholm.</i>

443
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:29,541
<i>Your mother was single
and raised you alone.</i>

444
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:32,166
<i>She brought you here
when you were six years old.</i>

445
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,375
Alice. Her name's Alice.

446
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:36,458
<i>No.</i>

447
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:39,000
- Her name isn't Alice?
<i>- Isabelle.</i>

448
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,916
No, no, no. I can see her.

449
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,916
- <i>No, Liz...</i>
- I can see her.

450
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,041
<i>Liz, never mind. Stay with me.</i>

451
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:47,541
<i>You went to Oxford
after medical school in Paris.</i>

452
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:49,916
Oxford. Oxford.

453
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,791
I remember Oxford. That's where I met Léo.

454
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:57,666
That's where I met him.
He's real, I know he is.

455
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:58,625
<i>Elizabeth?</i>

456
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:01,708
Look for Léo. I swear he exists.

<i>Oxygen level, 15%.</i>

- Where are you? You should have found me.

459
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:09,291
<i>Stay strong.
Just a few more minutes.</i>

460
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:12,000
I need the codes! I need the codes!

461
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,875
<i>I have men at Cryosalide
getting the codes.</i>

462
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:17,666
But why are they… It's too long.

463
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:20,875
Who are you talking to?

464
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:23,625
What? Hello?

465
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:26,416
Who are you talking to?
I hear you talking to someone.

466
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,083
- <i>You're hearing things.</i>
- You're talking. No, no.

467
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,125
<i>Liz. We're on it.
We're close. We're really close.</i>

468
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:33,768
- You're lying.
- <i>We're 20 minutes away.</i>

469
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:35,753
- Are you doing this to me?
- <i>We're nearly there.</i>

470
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:38,291
<i>I was in the army.</i>

471
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,017
<i>- I spent months in a hole underground...</i>
- You're doing this to me.

472
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:44,125
<i>I've been in that situation.
I know what you're going through.</i>

473
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:46,805
- <i>I'm with you...</i>
- MILO, hang up.

474
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:48,416
- <i>No, Liz...</i>
- MILO, hang up.

475
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,333
- <i>Wait...
- Disconnected.</i>

476
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,416
<i>Incoming call.</i>

477

Reject call.

479

<i>Call rejected.</i>

480
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,541
MILO, play the last 30 seconds
of the last transmission again.

481
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:51,708
<i>I need the codes! I need the codes!</i>

482
00:46:51,791 --> 00:46:54,416
<i>I have guys at Cryosalide
getting the codes.</i>

483
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,750
<i>But why?</i>

484
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,000
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

485
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,083
Pause.

486
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:04,500
Play the last five seconds again.

487
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:12,875
Pause.

488
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:18,500
Turn up the volume and play it back.

489
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:21,833
<i>Tell her she's
hearing things. That it's the stress.</i>

490
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,250
Again.

491
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:29,958
<i>Tell her she's hearing things.
That it's the stress.</i>

492
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:32,458
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

493
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,083
Pause.

494

Can you see me? Can you hear me?

498
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:47,375
What do you want from me?

499
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:48,541
<i>Incoming call.</i>

500
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,666
Are you assholes messing with me?

501
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:55,458
MILO, accept the call.

502
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:56,541
Who are you?

503
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,000
Why are you doing this to me?

504
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:01,083
<i>Hello?</i>

505
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,375
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

506
00:48:04,083 --> 00:48:05,500
<i>Answer me, please.</i>

507
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:09,125
<i>You're in a cryogenic unit, is that right?</i>

508
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:11,375
<i>You called me,
but you were looking for Léo.</i>

509
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:13,083
<i>Listen, we don't have much time.</i>

510
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:16,958
<i>It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
Something must have gone wrong.</i>

511
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:19,041
- I want to talk to Léo.
<i>- Impossible.</i>

512
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:21,041
<i>You must listen to me. I can help you.</i>

513
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:23,583
I won't listen until I speak to Léo.

514
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:26,375
- <i>That's impossible.</i>
- I want to talk to him now.

515
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:29,583
I want to talk to him now! Put him on now!

516
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:31,083
<i>Léo is dead.</i>

517
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:32,250
What?

518
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,708
I don't believe you.

519
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:38,041
<i>You really need to listen to me.</i>

520
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:39,125
<i>- Liz...</i>
- Go to hell.

521
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,416
- <i>No, listen to me...</i>
- MILO, end the call.

522
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:45,833
- <i>No, wait...
- Call ended. Oxygen level, 14%.</i>

00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:57,458
MILO, accept call.

526
00:48:57,541 --> 00:49:00,500
<i>Listen to me. I can help you.</i>

527
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:03,708
<i>No one else can help you
at this point, Liz.</i>

528
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:06,416
How do you know my name? I never told you.

529
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,833
<i>No need. I knew who you were
the moment I heard your voice,</i>

530
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:11,458
<i>even though I couldn't believe it.</i>

531
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:13,333
Tell me who you are, you and the others.

532
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:16,250
<i>I don't know who you spoke to,
but I know what's going on.</i>

533
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:18,666
- MILO, end...
<i>- I know the codes!</i>

534
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:19,583
Give them to me.

535
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:22,583
<i>- I will, but you have to listen...</i>
- Give them to me.

536
00:49:22,666 --> 00:49:25,666
<i>You can't use them
to open the unit!</i>

537
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:28,875
- MILO, end the...
<i>- Okay, okay.</i>

538
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:34,833
<i>Uppercase, N-M-347.</i>

539
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:38,500
<i>Lowercase, C-D-A.</i>

540
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:43,708
Transfer of administrator control.

541
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:48,750
<i>Administrator control
transfer launched. Enter the password.</i>

542
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:54,750
Uppercase, N-M-347. Lowercase, C-D-A.

543
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:57,291
<i>Liz, don't open it! Please!</i>

544
00:49:57,375 --> 00:50:00,666
<i>Administrator control transfer
complete.</i>

545
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,916
<i>Administrator privileges granted.</i>

546
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:10,291
MILO, unlock.

<i>Unlocking activated.</i>

548
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:16,458
<i>Please, no. You'll die.</i>

549
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:19,541
<i>I can prove it.
If you open the unit, you'll die.</i>

550
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:22,083
MILO, pause unlocking.
You have ten seconds.

551
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:24,126
<i>Thank you, thank you.
Just let me explain.</i>

552
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:25,750
- Eight seconds.
<i>- Okay, okay!</i>

553
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:27,875
<i>Go to "system preferences."</i>

554
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,250
<i>Find the centrifuge controls.</i>

555
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:32,708
- System preferences.
<i>- Please. Just let me explain.</i>

556
00:50:32,791 --> 00:50:34,166
Centrifuge controls.

557
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:36,541
Got them.

558
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,500
<i>It's set at one. Switch to...</i>

559
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:41,375
Switch to what?

560
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:43,208
<i>This isn't
how you should find out.</i>

561
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,541
Switch to what?

562
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:45,541
MILO…

563
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:48,125
<i>Zero. Switch to zero.</i>

564
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:50,916
Switch to zero.

565
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,208
<i>Please, Liz. Don't do it.</i>

566
00:50:53,291 --> 00:50:55,541
<i>Turning off microthrusters.</i>

567
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:58,916
<i>I'm sorry, Liz. I really am.</i>

568
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:09,333
<i>Alert, lengthy exposure
to weightlessness</i>

569
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:11,666
<i>can be harmful to the bioform.</i>

570
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:14,333
<i>Liz.</i>

571
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:26,916
<i>Liz!</i>

572
00:51:27,541 --> 00:51:28,791
Where am I?

573
00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:32,583
<i>Around 40,389 miles from Earth.</i>

574
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:34,250
No, no, no.

575
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:36,083
No.

576
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:41,875
MILO, distance from Earth?

577
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:44,875
<i>42,735 miles.</i>

578
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:48,916
That's not possible.

579
00:51:50,166 --> 00:51:52,333
<i>Sorry, Liz. But time is limited.</i>

580
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:56,750
<i>You'll soon be beyond the range
of our communication satellites.</i>

581
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,916
<i>Centrifuge rotation launched.</i>

582
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,083
<i>G-1 launched. Oxygen level, 13%.</i>

583
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,250
<i>Liz, please.</i>

584
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:13,750
<i>You were placed in hypersleep
to allow you to carry out your mission.</i>

585
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:16,375
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

586
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:18,458
<i>I can't bring you home.</i>

587
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:21,625
<i>But I designed the system,</i>

588
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:24,458
<i>and maybe we could
put you back into hypersleep.</i>

589
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:27,333
<i>It would give you a chance. Please.</i>

590
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:28,916
What mission?

591
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:34,666
<i>If we can locate the damage,
divert the affected systems…</i>

592
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:35,833
What mission?

593
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:41,708
<i>Colonizing a planet
orbiting around Wolf 10-61,</i>

594
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,875
<i>fourteen light-years from Earth.</i>

595
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:45,500
<i>But you only just left.</i>

596
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:50,333
<i>Your HIVE transporter hasn't yet engaged
its nuclear-powered thrust.</i>

597
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:53,916
No, no, no, no, no…

598
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,833
<i>Liz, we have to act fast.</i>

599
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:57,500
This isn't real.

600
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:14,791
Was it a military operation?
Do I work for the Ministry of Defense?

601
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,541
<i>Yes. Do you remember?</i>

602
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:17,750
Why the army?

603
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:21,708
<i>The human race
will die out in two generations.</i>

604
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,708
<i>That can't be made public.</i>

605
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:27,333
Did he know?

606
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:28,416
<i>Who?</i>

607
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:31,041
That guy. Moreau.

608
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:34,750
When I asked for help, he was kind,

609
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:39,125
- but he was lying to me, right?
<i>- Liz. He had no choice.</i>

610
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:42,083
<i>As soon as the police
looked for information about you,</i>

611
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:43,500
<i>the Ministry got involved.</i>

612
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:48,000
<i>Everything said after that
was only what they wanted you to hear.</i>

613
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:49,083
But why?

614
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,958
If I was a key part of the project,
why not just tell me the truth?

615
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:56,125
<i>The fog of memory.</i>

616
00:53:56,208 --> 00:54:00,875
<i>It was impossible to foresee your reaction
or the memories that would return first.</i>

617
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:02,666
<i>You're a threat.</i>

618
00:54:03,416 --> 00:54:06,000
<i>Speak to the wrong person,
and it all goes public.</i>

619
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:11,166
<i>General panic, chaos.
They couldn't take that risk.</i>

620
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:15,291
I thought he was doing this to me,
that he was holding me.

621
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,708
He didn't tell me Léo was dead,
he said he wasn't real.

622
00:54:19,791 --> 00:54:23,583
<i>Liz, everything, I mean everything,
everything was done</i>

623
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:27,416
<i>from the moment they realized
you'd regained consciousness</i>

624
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,250
<i>to prevent you
from recovering your memory.</i>

625
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,250
So he was playing for time.

626
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:38,500
He was waiting…

627
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:41,458
He was waiting
for me to run out of oxygen.

628
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:58,875
Léo was real…

629
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,291
and he's dead.

630
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:03,875
<i>Yes.</i>

631
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:15,958
Twelve percent. Twelve percent.

632
00:55:16,041 --> 00:55:17,750
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

633
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:22,333
What happened to him?

634
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:24,208
<i>He was sick.</i>

635
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:29,750
<i>Léo got sick, like millions of others
who were killed by the virus.</i>

636
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,416
<i>Liz?</i>

637
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:46,333
No, no, no. That doesn't add up.
They said I went missing three days ago.

638
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:50,041
<i>You've been in hypersleep
much longer than that.</i>

639
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:54,375
How long?

640
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:58,083
How long?

641
00:55:59,458 --> 00:56:00,541
<i>Twelve years.</i>

642
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,291
<i>I'm really sorry, Liz.</i>

643
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:11,000
<i>You're wasting your time and your oxygen.</i>

644
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:14,875
<i>In ten minutes, you'll be out of range,
and we won't be able to communicate.</i>

645
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:18,083
<i>Either you die alone,
or you help me to solve the problem</i>

646
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,875
<i>- and give yourself a chance.</i>
- No.

647
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:22,333
- <i>I know what I'd choose.</i>
- Okay, okay, okay.

648
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:26,875
Where do we begin?

649
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:31,666
<i>Okay, first we need
to figure out what woke you up.</i>

650
00:56:32,416 --> 00:56:34,291
MILO, why was the bioform awakened?

651
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:39,541
<i>Processor 3-54 overheating
due to loss of oxygen reserves.</i>

652
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:41,250
What is processor 3-54 used for?

653
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:45,458
<i>Processor 3-54 monitors and
stimulates the subject's cerebral activity</i>

654
00:56:45,541 --> 00:56:47,125
<i>to avoid cellular atrophy.</i>

655
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:50,833
Brain atrophy. You hear that?
I could do without that, personally.

656
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:52,208
<i>I agree.</i>

657
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:55,708
<i>We must divert
the cerebral activity monitor</i>

658
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:59,041
<i>to another processor
assigned to non-essential functions.</i>

659
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:02,291
MILO, list all the processors
linked to non-essential functions.

660
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:06,708
<i>All functions assigned
to processor 694.</i>

661
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:09,500
Is there any danger to the bioform

662
00:57:09,583 --> 00:57:12,041
if all functions of processor 694
are deactivated?

663
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:13,916
<i>Zero danger for the bioform.</i>

664
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,958
So, go on. Go on, deactivate them.

665
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:19,333
<i>Deactivation underway.</i>

666
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:35,000
MILO, transfer all functions
of processor 3-54 to 694.

667
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:37,708
<i>The data exceeds
processor capacity.</i>

668
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:39,375
Damn.

669
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,416
Shit.

670
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,208
What do we do now?

671
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:46,583
<i>We have to make
some difficult choices now.</i>

672
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:49,166
<i>Deactivate systems
that don't have priority.</i>

673
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:51,625
<i>Find... Too late! They're here!</i>

674
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:54,750
<i>- Find a way to install a shunt...</i>
- What do you mean, "they're here"?

675
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:58,666
<i>Return to hypersleep.
But do it before the oxygen hits 2%,</i>

676
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,875
<i>or you won't have enough
for resuscitation.</i>

677
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:02,958
But I won't know how to do it.

678
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:05,166
<i>You do know.
You have all the answers.</i>

679
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:09,791
<i>Figure out what triggers your memories,
then you'll find those you need.</i>

680
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:12,625
You designed it. I won't know how.

681
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:14,083
<i>On the ground!</i>

682
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:15,875
- Hello?
<i>- Right now!</i>

683
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:16,791
- <i>No.</i>
- Hello?

684
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:20,208
- <i>Find what triggers your memories.
- Get on the floor!</i>

685
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:22,642
- <i>Two percent! Find Léo!
- On the floor, I said!</i>

686
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:25,791
<i>Find Léo!</i>

687
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:27,041
<i>Connection lost.</i>

688
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:32,416
Shit, shit, shit. MILO, reconnect.

689
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:36,916
<i>This number is unassigned.
Please check the number.</i>

690
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,916
Don't leave me alone, please.

691
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:52,083
Okay.

692
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:54,958
Okay, okay, okay. I worked on this thing.

693
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:56,833
I worked on it.

694
00:58:56,916 --> 00:59:02,375
MILO, who authorized Omicron 267's
participation in this mission?

695
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:07,166
<i>Participation of Omicron 267
authorized by Hansen, Elizabeth, doctor.</i>

696
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:10,291
Yeah, of course.

697
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,750
So that's me. That's me.

698
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:14,333
It's me, it's me.

699
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:16,500
A thing only I know. Only I know.

700
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:19,750
"Find Léo, find Léo."
What does "find Léo" mean?

701
00:59:19,833 --> 00:59:21,625
What does it mean?

702
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:24,166
What does it mean,
damn it, "find Léo?"

703
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:27,083
What does it mean?

704
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:29,875
How do I do it? How do I do it?

705
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:32,385
<i>Oxygen level, 11%.</i>

706
00:59:37,583 --> 00:59:39,833
Okay, okay. Think.

707
00:59:39,916 --> 00:59:42,291
MILO, show me all low-priority processors.

708
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:47,333
Okay, okay, okay.

709
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,833
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

710
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:56,791
Too many. There are too many.

711
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:01,958
Explain kinetic regulation.

712
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:06,916
<i>Kinetic regulation delivers
weak electric impulses to muscle groups</i>

713
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,625
<i>to prevent atrophy.</i>

714
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:11,083
Okay. And if we deactivate it,
what happens?

715
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:13,833
<i>Degeneration of muscular tissue.</i>

716
01:00:13,916 --> 01:00:16,125
And that's considered low priority, right?

717
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:19,666
<i>Yes, because the bioform
would survive the journey.</i>

718
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,250
To die on being resuscitated.

719
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:26,916
<i>The bioform would survive
between three hours and ten days.</i>

720
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,583
MILO, limit results to
only processes that can be interrupted

721
01:00:29,666 --> 01:00:31,791
without reducing life expectancy.

722
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:36,166
<i>No non-priority processes
can be interrupted</i>

723
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,000
<i>without reducing life expectancy.</i>

724
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,458
Difficult choices.

725
01:00:41,416 --> 01:00:43,375
Find what triggers the memories.

726
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:46,666
Come on, come on.

727
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,958
If you have something to say,
now's the time.

728
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,666
I'm out of my mind.

729
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:34,708
<i>Warning, any deliberate damage

punishable by ten years imprisonment.</i>

731
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:39,916
So go on, electrocute me.

732
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,916

733
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:04,791

Don't you worry.
We'll meet again.

740
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:11,541
And that's our entry system.

741
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:26,500
MILO, search for Alice Hansen

<i>What? I can't hear you…</i>

753
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:13,416
I just wanted to hear your voice.

<i>Liz, my love, what's going on?</i>

755
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,083
I don't think anyone will come.

756

<i>Who won't come? Is everything all…</i>

757
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:36,000
I tried to find him.
I don't know where else to look.

942
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:12,833
What does that mean?

943
01:21:12,916 --> 01:21:15,875
<i>Chance of survival

944

946
01:21:20,916 --> 01:21:22,750
<i>Charitable Euthanasia Protocol.</i>

947
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:24,291

<i>- Fifty-eight.</i>

948
01:21:24,375 --> 01:21:25,750

<i>Heart rate high.
Would you like a sedative?</i>

970
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:55,333
You need my authorization for a sedative,
but not for a lethal injection?

971
01:22:56,416 --> 01:22:58,000
Are you still recording the message?

972
01:22:58,083 --> 01:23:02,750
<i>Yes. I am still recording
a message for Omicron 42.</i>

973
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:06,333
Léo, can you hear what I'm forced
to put up with? I mean, seriously…

974
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:14,250
MILO, which processor controls
the euthanasia protocols?

975
01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:20,250
<i>Processor 67-526
is assigned to all disaster scenarios.</i>

976
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:22,416
All scenarios
where you're supposed to kill me?

977
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,583
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Deactivate it.

978
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:29,000
<i>Deactivation of disaster scenarios
is contrary to the United Nations ruling</i>

979
01:23:29,083 --> 01:23:31,208
<i>concerning the Ethics of Medical Practice.</i>

980
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:34,625
In other words, if we deactivate,

981
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:37,791
you won't be able to kill me,
even if I beg you to?

982
01:23:37,875 --> 01:23:39,208
<i>Affirmative.</i>

983
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:44,958
Okay. Deactivate them.

984
01:23:46,125 --> 01:23:50,041
And redirect
all remaining functions of processor 3-54.

985
01:23:51,041 --> 01:23:53,166
<i>Deactivation of disaster scenarios.</i>

986
01:23:56,916 --> 01:24:01,208
<i>All functions
of processor 3-54 are now reassigned.</i>

987
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:10,500
Okay. Launch the return
to hypersleep protocol for the bioform.

988
01:24:12,208 --> 01:24:15,916
<i>Implementation impossible,
bioform disconnected.</i>

989
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:20,625
<i>Intravenous assistance unhooked.</i>

990
01:24:20,708 --> 01:24:25,666
<i>Medical umbilical ring unhooked.
Cerebral activity unhooked.</i>

991
01:24:28,875 --> 01:24:32,375
Okay. Think.
Think of the easiest thing.

992
01:24:33,083 --> 01:24:34,958
Does the bioform need two IVs?

993
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:40,125
<i>Affirmative. P1 for nutriments,
P2 for hypersleep management.</i>

994
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,750
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

995
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:08,208
It's going to go away.

996
01:25:08,791 --> 01:25:10,833
It's not real.

997
01:25:10,916 --> 01:25:12,458
Not real, it's not real.

998
01:25:14,791 --> 01:25:17,291
It wasn't me! It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

999
01:25:19,125 --> 01:25:20,333
I didn't clone you.

1000
01:25:37,375 --> 01:25:39,375
<i>Oxygen level, 2%.</i>

1001
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
<i>Intravenous P2 connected.</i>

1002
01:26:20,625 --> 01:26:22,250
Okay.

1003
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:53,958
<i>Medical umbilical ring connected.</i>

1004
01:27:14,083 --> 01:27:17,416
Okay. Come on, come on, come on.

1005
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,208
<i>Intravenous P1 connected.</i>

1006
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,416
<i>Two electrodes inactive.</i>

1007
01:28:03,791 --> 01:28:07,291
<i>Cerebral activity monitor
connected.</i>

1008
01:28:07,375 --> 01:28:09,791
<i>Oxygen level, 1%.</i>

1009
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:25,750
MILO, do I stand a chance
of surviving resuscitation?

1010
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:30,125
<i>No. An oxygen level of 2%
is the strict minimum for resuscitation.</i>

1011
01:28:35,708 --> 01:28:40,666
I imagine the promise was that
we'd wake together,

1012
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:42,791
but I won't be there.

1013
01:28:42,875 --> 01:28:44,041
I've tried everything.

1014
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:47,708
I'm not the only one lost…

1015
01:28:49,833 --> 01:28:52,125
I'm not the only one lost,
there are others.

1016
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:54,875
There are others.

1017
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:00,041
MILO, end of recording.

1018
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:02,750
<i>Recording ended.</i>

1019
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,166
Goodbye, Léo.

1020
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:16,333
<i>Oxygen level, 0.6%.</i>

1021
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:41,083
The others!

1022
01:29:41,958 --> 01:29:46,416
MILO, how much oxygen
is left in the lost units?

1023
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:49,333
<i>187 lost units
are at full capacity.</i>

1024
01:29:49,416 --> 01:29:52,791
Divert the oxygen
from the lost units to unit 267.

1025
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:55,125
<i>Diversion impossible
to carry out now.</i>

1026
01:29:55,208 --> 01:29:59,708
<i>Access to individual oxygen reserves
is limited for security reasons.</i>

1027
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:03,958
<i>It will require
approximately 14,227 minutes</i>

1028
01:30:04,041 --> 01:30:06,750
<i>to ignore the security restriction.</i>

1029
01:30:07,916 --> 01:30:10,791
<i>It is recommended
placing the bioform in hypersleep</i>

1030
01:30:10,875 --> 01:30:13,291
<i>for reasons
of preservation during the maneuver.</i>

1031
01:30:18,833 --> 01:30:20,375
Can you do that, MILO?

1032
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:23,458
<i>Do you want to begin
the return to hypersleep protocol</i>

1033
01:30:23,541 --> 01:30:25,166
<i>while I carry out the maneuver?</i>

1034
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Yes.

1035
01:30:32,666 --> 01:30:36,125
I could kiss you right now. Yes.

1036
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:39,500
Launch the hypersleep protocol.

1037
01:30:40,875 --> 01:30:43,500
<i>Return to hypersleep

<i>Would you like a sedative?</i>

1039
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,541
Yes.

1044
01:31:15,791 --> 01:31:17,583
MILO, I'm sorry for hitting you.

1045
01:31:19,375 --> 01:31:20,791
<i>Apology accepted.</i>

1046
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:25,958
MILO, tell me about the planet.

1047
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:28,458
What's it like?

1048
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:32,125
<i>Wolf 10-61c
has an orbital cycle of 18 days.</i>

1049
01:31:32,208 --> 01:31:34,916
<i>Its mass is around four times
that of Earth.</i>

1050
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,083
<i>Its lack of rotation makes life impossible</i>

1051
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:42,375
<i>on its sun-facing side, which is too hot,
and on its dark side, which is too cold.</i>

1052
01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:46,208
<i>The habitable area is therefore
on the border of day and night.</i>

1053
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:49,708
Tell me about the journey.

<i>Once nuclear-powered thrust

1060
01:32:12,791 --> 01:32:16,708
MILO, tell me about the beach in Maui.

1061
