1
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:15,182
Yo, I thought I was gonna see
some, like, vaginas.

2
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,356
I didn't say
she actually painted vaginas.

3
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:29,196
I said, some of her paintings
looked like vaginas.

4
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,700
Seriously? Not even close.

5
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:38,789
Georgia o'keeffe painted
all kinds of stuff.

6
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:42,501
Everyday items, her surroundings.

7
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:48,131
Some of it evoked an erotic nature.

8
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,134
It's who she was.

9
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:55,389
Not like any vagina I ever saw.

10
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,516
This chick have medical issues?

11
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,936
This particular painting...

12
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,021
Is of a door.

13
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,901
Any other doors we can check out?

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,904
Like, real ones or...?

15
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,450
You know, I don't get it.

16
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,579
Why would anyone
paint a picture of a door...

17
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,082
Over and over again,
like, dozens of times?

18
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,836
- But it wasn't the same.
- Yeah, it was.

19
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,714
It was the same subject,
but different every time.

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,466
The light was different,
her mood was different.

21
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,219
She saw something new
every time she painted it.

22
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,389
And that's not psycho to you?

23
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,684
Well, then why should we do anything
more than once?

24
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,395
Should I just smoke
this one cigarette?

25
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:47,149
Maybe we should only have sex once,
if it's the same thing.

26
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:51,069
- Whoa, no.
- Should we just watch one sunset?

27
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,364
Or live just one day?

28
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,160
It's new every time.
Each time is a different experience.

29
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,746
Okay, fine.

30
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:06,627
I guess the cow skull pictures
were cool, but a door?

31
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,673
I will say it again. A door.

32
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,219
Why not a door? Sometimes
you get fixated on something...

33
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,680
And you might not even get why.

34
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,391
You open yourself up
and go with the flow...

35
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,186
Wherever the universe takes you.

36
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:29,066
Okay, so the universe
took her to a door.

37
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:34,154
And she got all obsessed with it
and just had to paint it 20 times...

38
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,073
Until it was perfect.

39
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,492
I wouldn't say that. Nothing's perfect.

40
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,912
Yeah? Well...

41
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,456
I mean...

42
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,084
Some things.

43
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:05,018
That was so sweet,
I think I threw up in my mouth a bit.

44
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,064
You can't admit, just for once,
that I'm right.

45
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:13,610
Come on. That o'keeffe lady
kept trying over and over...

46
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,030
Until that stupid door was perfect.

47
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:21,243
No. That door was her home
and she loved it.

48
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,372
To me,
that's about making that feeling last.

49
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,701
All right, here we go. You ready?

50
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,874
Come on, give me a step.
Give me one step.

51
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,382
Nope. Nope, that's it. Take me up.

52
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,009
You can do this, Hank.

53
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:23,638
Come on, it's supposed to hurt.
Pain is weakness leaving your body.

54
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,807
Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie.

55
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,102
- If you can get your leg up, go for it.
- Take me up.

56
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,647
Coffee break. We're gonna let you rest
and then try again.

57
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,693
Never mind about your coffee break.
Take me up. I'm done. I'm done.

58
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,240
- We'll just pick up where we left off.
- Come on, Hank.

59
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,535
You can do it. How else
are you gonna get out of here?

60
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,206
Don't you have any friends?
I mean, Jesus, find something to do.

61
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:53,418
I don't need everyone staring at me
hanging here like a camel's ball sack.

62
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,171
Hank, he just wants to be supportive.

63
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,298
It's all right.

64
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,138
I'll be right back, okay?
Be right back.

65
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,226
Gonna get me out of here
sometime today?

66
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,063
Sky?

67
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:20,654
We got our first bill,
and, you know, if you're still insistent...

68
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,122
Prepare yourself.

69
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,799
They're gonna start coming in weekly
like that, so...

70
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:45,011
You're sure you can do this?

71
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,220
I'll do that.

72
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,559
What the hell, man?

73
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,812
What, I can't work a scale now?

74
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,025
This is bullshit. Just say it.

75
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,610
Just say the words.

76
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,070
You think I'm stealing.

77
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,463
Walk with who you are.

78
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,674
That was the phrase my sponsor
used to use with me...

79
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,510
Back when I first started
coming to meetings.

80
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,598
It's probably just a different way
of saying be yourself, right?

81
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:17,437
But this idea of "walk" also tells me...

82
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,733
That I have to move fonnard.
Always good advice, at least for me.

83
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,655
I see we have some new people here
at group, a couple new faces.

84
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,700
See some hands? First time?

85
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,126
Great. Welcome.

86
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,796
Maybe we can go around,
introduce ourselves.

87
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,090
Say whatever's on your mind.

88
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,009
How about you?
You wanna start us off?

89
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,391
Yeah. My name is Andrea...

90
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,856
We don't bite. No judgments.

91
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,276
You can be as open and honest
as you wanna be.

92
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,615
Honestly? I don't wanna be here.

93
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,497
All right, fair enough.
Who else had their hand up?

94
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,005
Hey, what's up?

95
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,340
My name's Jesse.

96
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:31,636
Well, hello. My name's Brandon.

97
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,889
And this is, I believe, Peter?

98
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,934
Right, I'm Peter. How are you?

99
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,362
Look, I just wanted
to give you a heads up.

100
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,990
It's gonna get slower
smuggling product...

101
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,743
With grandpa anus
watching every move I make.

102
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,871
But don't worry, I'll keep it flowing.

103
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,415
- Great, right on.
- Yeah.

104
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,793
So how's it selling?

105
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,462
Mad volume?

106
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,256
Yeah, it's...

107
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,884
You know, it's...

108
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,470
It's not so good.

109
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,223
What do you mean?
How much have you sold?

110
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,684
I sold a teenth.

111
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:24,147
- One teenth? That's it?
- Yeah.

112
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,440
To who?

113
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:33,782
It's not easy selling to these people.
They're trying to better themselves.

114
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,452
Yeah, there's, like, positivity and stuff
going on here.

115
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,081
I'm out risking my ass
to get product for you two...

116
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,042
And you're too pussy to sell?

117
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,003
You're pathetic.

118
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,590
You know what? I want it back.
All of it.

119
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,135
- I'll sell it myself.
- Come on, man. Don't be like that.

120
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,931
Selling to these people,
it's like shooting a baby in the face.

121
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,350
It's not so easy like you think.

122
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:05,480
I will show you
exactly how easy it is.

123
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,944
- Thank you.
- All right.

124
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,029
See you next week.

125
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,668
- Oh, hey, sorry.
- No, go ahead.

126
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,295
Andrea, right?

127
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,007
- Yeah.
- Hey, my name's Jesse...

128
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:38,138
And I don't really
wanna be here either.

129
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,018
Sorry.

130
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,918
Aunt Marie's coming to dinner?

131
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,381
Your dad is.

132
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,889
How'd you get her to sleep so quick?

133
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,141
Are you that boring?

134
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,977
I'm comforting.

135
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:29,731
I'm a comforting presence.

136
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,743
Hey, so check it out.

137
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,120
See what that means?

138
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,330
Check out the date.

139
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:51,044
Next Thursday is officially six months
that I've had my learner's.

140
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:57,300
Which means I can get my provisional
and start driving by myself.

141
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,970
You don't turn 16
for two more months.

142
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,598
It doesn't matter, it's a provisional.

143
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,726
Look it up. They changed the law
like, 10 years ago.

144
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,811
Yeah, well, I didn't vote for that.

145
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,232
Doesn't matter if you voted for it,
it's the law.

146
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:16,611
So both of you start thinking about
what kind of car you wanna buy me.

147
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:21,491
I think I'd be good
with either an old iroc or a 'stang.

148
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,036
A 'stang.

149
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,498
How about something
with playing cards in the spokes?

150
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,793
Makes a nice motory sound,
you know?

151
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,006
Dad, you're not gonna
get off that easy.

152
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,177
Well, I think that this is...

153
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:44,847
We should probably
table this discussion for later.

154
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,643
Your dad and I have a couple things
we need to talk about, so...

155
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,561
Okay.

156
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,108
A 1971 mach 1 fastback...

157
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:59,862
In grabber lime
with a shaker hood.

158
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,406
'Stang.

159
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:06,953
I'll write that down so we don't forget.
Oh, darn it, no pencil.

160
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:14,977
http://hiqve.com/

161
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,148
What is
"ice station zebra associates"?

162
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,111
It's a loan out, it's fine.

163
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,280
Whose loan out?

164
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,158
It's fine. Really.

165
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,579
Have a guy.

166
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,415
Okay.

167
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,669
Does your guy know the tax code
and regulations in new Mexico?

168
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,965
There's very specific papenrvork that
has to be submitted quarterly on this.

169
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,926
Yes. My guy is a top...

170
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,803
- Guy.
- Who is he?

171
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,556
What's his name?
What are his qualifications?

172
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:14,145
Walt, this money
has to be unimpeachable...

173
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,814
When it reaches Hank and Marie.

174
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,400
And it is. It will be.

175
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,780
But how do I know that? I mean,
you can't even tell me the man's name.

176
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,241
Jesus, Skyler,
do you really wanna know?

177
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,993
Do you really wanna know?

178
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,749
Really?

179
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,119
What a pleasure it is to have you.

180
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,664
I'm gonna call you Skyler,
if that's okay. It's a lovely name.

181
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:18,209
Reminds me of a big beautiful sky.

182
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:23,047
Walt never told me how lucky he was...
Prior to recent unfortunate events.

183
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,300
His taste in women
is the same as his taste in lawyers...

184
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:30,096
Only the very best
with just the right amount of dirty.

185
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:36,060
That's a joke. That's a joke.

186
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,855
It's funny because you are so clearly
very classy.

187
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,607
Here, please, sit down.

188
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:47,113
So Walt tells me that you have
some concerns I can alleviate.

189
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,574
Yes, I do. I have...

190
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,204
If we're going to go down this road...

191
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,458
And clearly we are
for the sake of my brother-in-law...

192
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,753
I've heard about him.
He's an American hero.

193
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,092
At any rate, I need some assurances
that we're gonna go about this...

194
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,762
In a manner that is extremely safe
and cautious.

195
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,891
Fair enough.
I'll walk you through the process.

196
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:19,395
First step is something we like to call
money laundering, all right?

197
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:23,524
Take your money, represented by,
say, these jelly beans...

198
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,235
You know, I'm a bookkeeper,
so I actually...

199
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,613
I know what money laundering is.

200
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:36,370
And as with most things,
the devil is in the details.

201
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,958
So to begin with, what are we saying
is the source of this money?

202
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,710
That's simple.

203
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:47,131
Walt here, actually came up with
a great story about gambling winnings.

204
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,717
Blackjack, right?
Some card-counting system?

205
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,303
Well, actually that was Skyler's idea.

206
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:57,475
Well, you grow more gorgeous
by the minute.

207
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,143
There you have it.

208
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,523
I'll generate false currency transaction
reports out the wazoo...

209
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:08,236
As well as the necessary w-2gs.
I know a couple casino managers...

210
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,405
Who will jump at the chance
to report false losses.

211
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,115
It's a win-win for everyone.

212
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,952
Yeah, but you can't sell that
for very long...

213
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,704
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Way ahead of you.

214
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,541
We declare just enough
not to arouse suspicion...

215
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:26,587
Then Walt's onetime winnings
become seed money for an investment.

216
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,631
Investment in what?

217
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,633
Drum roll, please. Wait for it.

218
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,927
Laser tag.

219
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,974
Laser tag. Seven thousand square feet
of rollicking fun...

220
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,643
In the heart
of northern bernalillo county.

221
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,688
Laser tag?

222
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:48,025
Yeah, there's guns and glow lights,
and kids wear the vests...

223
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,070
Yeah, no, no. I actually...
I know what it is.

224
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,323
It's just that in relation to Walt, it's...

225
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,535
I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

226
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,289
Makes more sense
than you two being together.

227
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:05,710
Do you even know Walt?
I mean, how would he, of all people...

228
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,630
Buy a laser tag business?
It doesn't add up.

229
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:14,051
It adds up perfectly. Walt's a scientist,
scientists love lasers.

230
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,470
Plus, they got bumper boats, so...

231
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,014
"Hey, everybody...

232
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:23,144
Walt suddenly decided to invest
in laser tag. Just out of the blue."

233
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:27,898
Really? That's what we're supposed
to tell people, our family, our friends...

234
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,483
The government?

235
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,487
Let me bottom line this for you.
You don't need to be involved, okay?

236
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,032
I've been doing this
for a lot of years...

237
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,118
Successfully, believe it or not,
without your help.

238
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,457
So thank you for stopping by.

239
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,310
You want a beer or something?

240
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,063
Or something?

241
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,023
What do you mean?

242
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,276
Like, beer.

243
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,029
I'm cleaned out of anything else.

244
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:21,035
Even if I wasn't,
we're not supposed to.

245
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:30,127
I've heard it over and over
and over again.

246
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,632
You know,
don't you think it's ridiculous...

247
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,511
That society says beer is okay...

248
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:43,391
And a little hit of something sweet
is wrong?

249
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:48,854
I mean, what's the point
of shutting yourself off completely...

250
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,733
From something
that lifts you off the ground?

251
00:19:55,403 --> 00:20:02,702
I spend so much energy
fighting the urge not to use...

252
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,330
And I feel like crap because of it.

253
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:13,671
- I know, it's just...
- What?

254
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,093
I can't get caught using again.

255
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,182
See, the thing is...

256
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,854
Not to get caught.

257
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,401
You ever try that blue stuff
that's going around?

258
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:41,699
Just a little gas in the tank...

259
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:46,954
And suddenly
everything is interesting.

260
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,418
Man, I wish
I could make that feeling last.

261
00:20:56,464 --> 00:21:00,092
Like I said, I got nothing here.

262
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:06,056
What if I could get some?

263
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,232
- Mommy, mommy.
- Hey, baby.

264
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,444
Your Nana brought you home early.

265
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,365
Grandma, I thought
you were keeping Brock today?

266
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,577
I was, then I saw your car.

267
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,790
- I thought you had a meeting.
- I did, but we changed the time.

268
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,126
Grandma, this is Jesse.
He's from the meeting.

269
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:38,380
He's like a sponsor.
Jesse, this is grandma.

270
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,191
Jesse, this is Brock.

271
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,363
So you have a kid, huh?

272
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,031
What's up?

273
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,492
Brock, huh?

274
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,203
That's a cool name.

275
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,998
Here, give it up.

276
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:27,513
Brock is almost 6.
You okay, with kids?

277
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,641
What? Yeah. Yeah, he's cool.

278
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,938
Okay, Brock is gonna go play
in his room while the big people talk.

279
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,149
He's gonna go play with his legos
and his cars.

280
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,235
- Say, "bye, Jesse."
- Bye, Jesse.

281
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,905
Hope you had a good time
at grandma's.

282
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,408
Oh, I fixed your blue car,
do you remember?

283
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:48,742
The convertible one?

284
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,621
You can jump on your bed.
Play with your toys.

285
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:57,751
Safe and cautious, that's all I'm asking,
and that man...

286
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,461
Is neither.

287
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,799
I'll admit
he comes across like a circus clown...

288
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,885
But he knows what he's doing.

289
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,555
And safe and cautious
is you not being involved in this at all.

290
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,765
Well, it's a little late on that.

291
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,853
This is what happens when you decide
to pay our bills with drug money.

292
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,526
Skyler...

293
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,530
This isn'tjust about
what happened before.

294
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:33,495
My involvement in this is ongoing.

295
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,501
I can't just quit.

296
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:45,049
I have something of a contract.

297
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,218
But it's all very safe, professional.

298
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,429
Structured.

299
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,349
Like, I can't simply quit.

300
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,109
Where you going?

301
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,586
If you're gonna launder money,
Walt...

302
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:25,631
At least do it right.

303
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,276
You worked here four years.

304
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,570
It's a business you understand.

305
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,990
It's a story people will believe.

306
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,492
Not laser tag, this.

307
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,787
This is what we buy.

308
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,418
This is what you buy.

309
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:28,819
Yeah, I mean, there's free doughnuts.
Nothing's wrong with a free doughnut.

310
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:36,660
Hey, Jesse, right?

311
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:39,788
Brandon, Peter.
How goes it? Hanging in there?

312
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,999
Can we please, just...?

313
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,292
Dumb-ass.

314
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:47,004
Sorry, man.
I was trying to keep it on the dl.

315
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:51,258
So you and that girl, do the deed yet?

316
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,218
Do what?

317
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,930
You know, sell to her?

318
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,601
What are you two even doing here?

319
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,604
What do you mean?

320
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:08,233
You can't get your nut up to sell,
what's the point of even coming?

321
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,070
Homey, I'm on, like, step five.

322
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,489
Deuce, yo. I'm catching up.

323
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,706
Whatever. Later.

324
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,961
Hey.

325
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,839
Dude needs to come into the fold.

326
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,008
Yup.

327
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,473
Hey, you know what?
I have magical powers.

328
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,183
You wanna see?

329
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,937
Ready?

330
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,441
That's not real.

331
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,611
It is real. All right,
do you wanna see something real?

332
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,404
Look at this. Watch this.

333
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,907
Ready?

334
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,915
You like that?

335
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,919
That's science and stuff,
makes it do that.

336
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:12,131
- Do it again.
- Let Jesse eat his dinner, Brock.

337
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,134
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.
Wanna see it again?

338
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,886
Could you do a trick
with firecrackers?

339
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,347
Firecrackers?

340
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:24,226
You know,
I don't have any firecrackers on me.

341
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:27,688
- Who does tricks with firecrackers?
- Tomas.

342
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:32,151
Tomas does tricks with firecrackers,
huh? Who's Tomas?

343
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,945
- He's my kid brother.
- Yeah?

344
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,822
And we don't talk about him.

345
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,701
Come on, eat your food, Brock.

346
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,081
Can I have a chip?
I'm gonna steal your chip.

347
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,000
Hey, that's mine.

348
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,254
That's it?
That's what you wanna buy?

349
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,215
People will believe it, at least.

350
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,509
I worked here for four years.

351
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,012
"Wax on, wax off," was that you?

352
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,390
Hey, how come you guys
always give air freshener?

353
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,726
I explicitly say, "no air freshener"...

354
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:10,022
And every time, I drive away
smelling like an alpine whorehouse.

355
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:14,526
All due respect, I don't see it.
So I vote no.

356
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,863
It makes a better story
than your laser tag.

357
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,490
Is that you talking or Yoko Ono?

358
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:25,454
She has a point. It makes more sense
that I invest right here.

359
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:29,541
Based on her years of experience
in money laundering, I suppose.

360
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,337
If you're committed enough,
you can make any story work.

361
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,340
I once convinced a woman
that I was Kevin costner...

362
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,718
And it worked because I believed it,
all right?

363
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,054
Has nothing to do with the story.

364
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:46,308
Besides, this dump isn't gonna work
because it doesn't have a Danny.

365
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:47,768
There's no Danny here.

366
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,897
What in god's name is a Danny?

367
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:56,235
Danny runs the laser tag.
Danny is the guy who had a vision.

368
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:01,031
Where others saw a dirt lot,
he saw black lights, rubber aliens...

369
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,867
Teenagers running around
with ray guns, right?

370
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,827
Like bugsy Siegel in the desert.

371
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:09,456
When the stock market took a shit
and Danny got into trouble...

372
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:13,460
He went searching for exactly
the type of situation we're offering.

373
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:17,631
Danny will look the other way
to keep his dream afloat.

374
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:21,677
In other words,
Danny can be trusted completely.

375
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:27,432
That guy, the guy with the eyebrows
that won't quit, is he a Danny?

376
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:32,020
You buy this place, all you got
is a big building that squirts water.

377
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,524
You got no Danny here.

378
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,079
You wanna stay for dinner?

379
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,460
What time is it?

380
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,047
Early still.

381
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,432
What?

382
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:14,938
Thought maybe if you're holding,
we can do something.

383
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,941
What?

384
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:22,070
You know, that blue stuff
you were talking about.

385
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,115
- Maybe you had a line on some?
- Wait.

386
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,077
What?

387
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:32,039
Thought you said
the kid is coming home.

388
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:35,208
Yeah, in a few hours.

389
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,627
And you seriously wanna get high?

390
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,922
I don't know what
you're getting pissed about.

391
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,383
You're the one who brought it up.

392
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:47,262
Yeah, that was before
I found out you got a kid.

393
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,389
What kind of mother are you?

394
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,932
What?

395
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:55,020
You heard me. What kind of mom
gets wasted with a kid to take care of?

396
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:02,569
Nobody can say
I don't take care of my son.

397
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,696
You come in my house
and judge me?

398
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:08,116
Like you got no responsibilities
so it's okay for you?

399
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,701
What do you know about me?

400
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,537
I take care of my baby.
I'll do anything for him.

401
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,041
The day Brock was born, I swore...

402
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,128
I won't let what happened to Tomas,
happen to my son.

403
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,924
I'll die first.

404
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,885
Sorry. I...

405
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,554
I just...

406
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,062
Look, I'll get out of here if you want.

407
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,147
That's what you wanna do, then go.

408
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,066
It's not what I want.

409
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:45,445
Look, I was out of line
talking about that stuff.

410
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:59,084
We both were.

411
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,213
You're right...

412
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:06,675
I don't know
what you've been through.

413
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,177
You can tell me if you want.

414
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:16,101
This whole neighborhood's
run by gangs.

415
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:20,439
They run the drugs,
control the streets.

416
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:26,069
They sort of took Tomas in.

417
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:28,738
No dad around.

418
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,075
Eight years old...

419
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,120
They got Tomas slinging.

420
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,873
Part of some crew.

421
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,419
Then when he was 10...

422
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:46,840
For some initiation or something...

423
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,427
They made him kill somebody.

424
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:57,601
I heard the rumors.
I didn't believe it at first.

425
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,397
But then I saw him like a week later.

426
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,279
And he told me, yeah, he did it.

427
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,366
They gave Tomas a gun.

428
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,328
Gave him a choice.

429
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,414
Him or some dude.

430
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,709
So he did it.

431
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,172
Told me all about it
like it was nothing.

432
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,842
Who did he say he killed?

433
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,762
Some dealer.

434
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,141
From some outside crew.

435
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:43,063
Right around the corner from here,
over off of central.

436
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:49,152
Just rode up on his bike
and shot him.

437
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,950
Off of central?

438
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,204
Like over by the train tracks?

439
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,166
When was this?

440
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,628
Few months back.

441
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,009
What else did he tell you?

442
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,725
He shot the guy
right through the neck.

443
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,895
Shot him dead.

444
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:30,235
Just because he was working
the wrong corner.

445
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,118
It won't happen again.

446
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,037
Not to my son.

447
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,515
Guess what.

448
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:06,104
People who say "guess what" and
then actually expect you to guess...

449
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,106
I hate those people.

450
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,941
Well, I just heard...

451
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:14,863
About a certain patient
named schrader-comma-Hank...

452
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,450
Who is going to be released
at the end of this week.

453
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,453
Isn't that fantastic?

454
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,998
They plan on rolling me
out the front door?

455
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:28,376
Or put me on a greased plank
and slide me out the window?

456
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,170
Hey.

457
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:34,424
I don't care what any damned
insurance company thinks.

458
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:38,720
- I'm not leaving here till I'm well.
- Hank, this isn't about insurance.

459
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:43,350
I've talked to everybody, they all say
you are healthy enough to go home.

460
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:47,270
- I'm healthy enough, huh? Yeah.
- Hank, you get stronger every day.

461
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,481
You don't need to be in a hospital.

462
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,734
In this condition, yeah, I do.

463
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,820
You'll be just as comfortable at home
as you are here.

464
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,866
- You'll have all the same equipment.
- Same equipment? What's that mean?

465
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:03,953
The equipment that you have here,
that you need. Short-term.

466
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,207
You'll do your pt at home
and it'll be great...

467
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:10,168
Because you'll be home.

468
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:13,713
Wait till you see the bedroom.
I had them move the plasma in.

469
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,007
I know that's how
you always wanted it.

470
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,802
You only had to get shot to get it,
right?

471
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:22,347
- I got you a new bed...
- A hospital bed?

472
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,307
Well...

473
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:27,185
You put a hospital bed
in my bedroom?

474
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,897
You'll be home.

475
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,067
You get that out of my house.

476
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,236
You hear me, Marie?

477
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:37,821
Today.

478
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,449
- Hank...
- I leave this hospital...

479
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:45,453
When I walk out of here.
You understand?

480
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,207
And not before.

481
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,837
What's a Danny?

482
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,839
Danny's an accomplice.

483
00:36:56,005 --> 00:37:00,760
Someone who's in on the scheme,
who knows about laundering...

484
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,388
Who's paid to look the other way.

485
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:08,643
Now, while I agree with you
that laser tag is a hard sell...

486
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,605
Without a Danny,
the car wash isn't really an option.

487
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:17,026
And he can't get you another Danny
to run the car wash?

488
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,904
Easier said than done.

489
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,366
If we're looking
for someone trustworthy.

490
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,922
What about me?

491
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:42,761
What about you?

492
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,308
I'll be the Danny.

493
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:51,936
No. No, no, Skyler,
that is not a good idea.

494
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,397
I'm capable of managing
a small business.

495
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,232
A legal business, not this.

496
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,859
Who else could we trust?

497
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,069
- No.
- Walt...

498
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,946
I'm in this.

499
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,116
- And if I'm in it, I'm gonna do it right.
- No.

500
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:09,287
- You are not in this. You are not...
- We're married, how am I not in this?

501
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,956
We are not married, Skyler,
we're divorced.

502
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,675
Right?

503
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:30,850
I never actually got around
to filing the papers.

504
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:39,150
Married couples can't be compelled
to testify against one another.

505
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,571
So there's that.

506
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:11,516
Jesse.jesse.

507
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,935
Respirator.

508
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,146
Right.

509
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,002
Yes?

510
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:50,221
Yes, all right. Okay.

511
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,266
Yeah, I'll be there.

512
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,437
What was that?

513
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,524
An invitation.

514
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,087
Walter, you're right on time.

515
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,423
Please, come in.

516
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,392
I hope you like paila Marina.

517
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,270
It's a fancy name for fish stew.

518
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:45,318
It sounds like a cliche, but indeed,
it's just like my mother used to make it.

519
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:53,326
Come on. You can help me cook.

520
00:40:54,911 --> 00:41:00,500
This is a Chilean dish that I love...

521
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:03,169
But I never get to make it.

522
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,505
Kids won't eat it.

523
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,843
You know how that is.

524
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,680
Sure.

525
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,977
Do you mind?

526
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,689
Would you slice the garlic?

527
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,484
Very thin.

528
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,828
Why did you invite me here?

529
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,373
We're working together...

530
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,875
Why not break bread together?

531
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,380
Now, the garlic?

532
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:08,401
It always amazes me the way the
senses work in connection to memory.

533
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:11,904
I mean, this stew is simply
an amalgam of ingredients.

534
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,908
Taken separately, these ingredients
alone don't remind me of anything.

535
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,244
I mean, not very much at all.

536
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:23,833
But in this precise combination,
the smell of this meal...

537
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,336
Instantly, it brings you back
to my childhood.

538
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,796
How is that possible?

539
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,425
Basically, it takes place
in the hippocampus.

540
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,388
Neural connections are formed.

541
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:43,144
The senses make the neurons
express signals...

542
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:48,357
That go right back to the same part
of the brain as before.

543
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,818
Where memory is stored.

544
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:56,574
It's something called
relational memory.

545
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,205
Don't quote me on that, I'm...

546
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,249
I'm rusty on my biology.

547
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,710
That's very interesting.

548
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,134
I would like to help you, if I could.

549
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,180
Help me how?

550
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:22,892
Well, when I first started out,
I made a lot of mistakes.

551
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,978
More than I care to admit.

552
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,607
I wish I'd had someone
to advise me...

553
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:33,528
Because this life of ours...

554
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,531
It can ovennhelm.

555
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,287
You are a wealthy man now.

556
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,833
And one must learn to be rich.

557
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,336
To be poor, anyone can manage.

558
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:56,300
What advice do you have for me?

559
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,681
Never make the same mistake twice.

560
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,224
Hey.

561
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,518
What's up?

562
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,688
You...? You Tomas?

563
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,732
I heard you were the man.

564
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:54,692
Yeah, what you want?

565
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,947
Crystal.

566
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,200
You think you could hook me up?

567
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,120
- Three hundred.
- For a teenth?

568
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,456
Shit, come on, yo.

569
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,106
Hey, what's up?

570
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,326
Hey, yo.

571
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,640
Bounce.

572
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:09,664
