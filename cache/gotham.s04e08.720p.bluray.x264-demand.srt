1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,368
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:04,452
You can trust me.

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,538
We don't work for you
and we don't work with you.

4
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:08,840
Your captain says otherwise.

5
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,839
<i>So Penguin's guys are gonna beat
and torture their way through the city.</i>

6
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:12,919
Get off of him.

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,003
You better pray.

8
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,713
I can clean up your mess
on this one, Harvey.

9
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,469
It has to be a trap.

10
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,179
Hey! Got him!

11
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,885
Oh, no, Patel.

12
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,096
<i>The Demonz.
They have a chop shop across town.</i>

13
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,522
<i>Let's hit it.</i>

14
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:25,940
<i>We've got a business to run.</i>

15
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,480
<i>I came here with Grundy,
to make some money</i>

16
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,560
<i>to get me smart again.</i>

17
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:30,941
I'm looking for the person
in charge here.

18
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,865
You're looking at her.
Hey, go get the doc.

19
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:34,941
Fight!

20
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:37,485
Grundy fight now?

21
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,569
Yes!

22
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,991
Yes! Grundy, Ed's best friend.

23
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:49,877
And now,
the most hated man in Gotham.

24
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,500
The Penguin.

25
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:58,132
I'm so happy to be here.

26
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,556
You love me, I knew you loved me.

27
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,099
You don't love me?

28
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:12,604
You don't love me? You've asked for it.

29
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,782
I'm going to sic my lackeys onto you.

30
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:20,203
My hoods and the GCPD.

31
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:22,284
Get 'em, boys.

32
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,073
Get 'em.

33
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,493
You work for Penguin.
You work for Penguin.

34
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,786
You gotta do what I want

35
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:33,963
or they're gonna enter your homes
and terrorize your families.

36
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,510
Get 'em.

37
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,806
You do what I say.

38
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,759
Grundy! Grundy! Grundy!

39
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,311
Grundy! Grundy!

40
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:52,982
Now, you leave me alone, you monster.

41
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:12,001
- Stupid lame bird brain.
- Bird brain!

42
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,505
He'll never learn.
You can't mess with The Narrows.

43
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,674
It is time,

44
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,930
for the main event,

45
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,684
a title defense.

46
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,312
No refs, no rules.

47
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,608
No rules.

48
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:39,904
Our challenger, Mr. Murderface.

49
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,909
Yeah!

50
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:47,620
And our champeen,

51
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,831
straight from the slaughter swamp.

52
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,709
It's Solomon Grundy.

53
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,252
They really ate it up tonight.

54
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,137
I think they hate Penguin
almost as much as I do.

55
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,883
You know what, I may or may not
find a cure for you

56
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,888
but at the rate you're going
you may not have a chance.

57
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,811
What does that mean?

58
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,183
You don't just have
these people laughing,

59
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,480
you have them ready for a fight.

60
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,433
- So?
- So?

61
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,732
So what happens when Penguin
hears about all this?

62
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,406
Well, let that bird waddle in here,
I have Grundy.

63
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,482
I'm gonna be fine.

64
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,572
And what about them? Your fans?

65
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,652
Not my problem.

66
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,118
Ed, you put yourself on
the front line of something.

67
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,621
You can't just bail
when fighting starts.

68
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,704
Okay, Doctor, if you would like
to stop hiding from your past

69
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,540
and do some leading, you go right ahead.

70
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,756
- It's not what I'm here for.
- Well then, case closed.

71
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,050
Neither of us are willing
to put our necks out.

72
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,780
<i>Hey, Butch.</i>

73
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,416
Yeah! Yeah!

74
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:17,913
<i>Hey, Butch.</i>

75
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,457
Oh!

76
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,277
Stop hitting yourself,
stop hitting yourself!

77
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,983
Stop hitting yourself,
stop hitting yourself.

78
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,409
Stop hitting yourself.

79
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,362
I love this.

80
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,242
I love it!

81
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,973
Congratulations, Captain Gordon.

82
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,385
A promotion?

83
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,061
Harvey Bullock is captain
of Gotham Central.

84
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,277
Bullock's lost the rank and file, Jim.

85
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:27,154
That debacle in The Narrows,
teaming up with Penguin's goons?

86
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,116
Sending cops into The Pyg's trap.

87
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,995
You know, he's a disgrace.

88
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,326
What does that make you?

89
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,040
- Excuse me?
- Last time I checked,

90
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,090
you signed over the entire GCPD
to Penguin, wholesale.

91
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,297
What does he think of this?

92
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:49,176
Well, perhaps I've earned
that kind of cynicism, Jim.

93
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,179
But I wanna assure you
with hand on heart

94
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,762
that this has nothing to do
with Mr. Cobblepot.

95
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,774
- I won't take Harvey's job.
- Someone is going to,

96
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,899
and trust me, none of our
other candidates share

97
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,278
your misgivings about Penguin.

98
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,159
Why don't you just take it with you?

99
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,072
When you decide, all you have to do
is sign on the dotted line.

100
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,460
And you'll be the new captain
of Gotham Central.

101
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,840
Nobody steals
from the Demonz, Mr. Penguin.

102
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,051
Why do I pony up for a license
if some crook

103
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,228
who can just swoop in
and rip off our swag?

104
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,227
Your swag might as well have
been a lollipop in a baby's hand.

105
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,559
You admit it.
She admits it, Mr. Penguin.

106
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,486
Oswald, what say we resolve
this like professionals?

107
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,565
The ladies and I will take out
the rest of these so called Demonz

108
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,524
and split their goods with you 50/50.

109
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,576
Uncivilized is what
these girls are.

110
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,245
Outside the bounds
of a proper criminal society.

111
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,322
What?

112
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,247
Repeat that for my guests.

113
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,371
Uh...

114
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:07,835
Ed Nygma, who owes his life
to Mr. Cobblepot's mercy,

115
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:13,007
is repaying that generosity by aping
his benefactor in a crude

116
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,924
<i>commedia dell'arte.</i>

117
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,677
What?

118
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:24,818
He's making fun of me
in a clown show in The Narrows!

119
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,583
Pretty funny,
the Riddler's doing a Penguin act.

120
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,798
That is not his name.

121
00:07:56,393 --> 00:08:01,184
His name is Ed. Plain, dumb, Ed.

122
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,189
And you don't know him,
so you don't get to laugh.

123
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,530
Well, thank you, Oswald,
for clearing our account.

124
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:20,581
Not cleared, Babs.
The debt you owe him, you now owe me.

125
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,204
Of course, what will it be?

126
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,704
Seeing as you love a good laugh,

127
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,879
I would like you to go
to The Narrows

128
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,673
and see Ed's act for yourself.

129
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,965
Then I would like you to bundle him up

130
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,922
and bring him back to me by nightfall!

131
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,223
We're not your toadies.

132
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,846
Dear child,
what was that you said?

133
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:44,101
What do we get if we bring you Nygma?

134
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,308
Very well.

135
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:54,608
In exchange, I will not set every
criminal in this city after you.

136
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,569
I will not let them cut out
your eyes and feed 'em to you

137
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,117
along with your ears and then your noses

138
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,197
and then your tongues.

139
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,706
That is what you get.

140
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,879
- Acceptable?
- Yes, Oswald, that is acceptable.

141
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,248
Ladies.

142
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,435
Mr. Penn will put you in contact
with my Narrows informer.

143
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,189
If those three do not have
Ed in hand promptly,

144
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,606
you will go down there
and burn them all to cinders.

145
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,195
What about feeding them their eyes
and all that?

146
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,408
Trust me, it's a great idea.

147
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,078
But far too messy to be practical.

148
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,625
So give me the scoop
on this Cherry's joint.

149
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,927
It's mainly crazy prize fights.
Chainsaw matches and stuff.

150
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,888
Well, back in the day,
we'd settle our beefs in the ring.

151
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,682
Winner takes all.

152
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,475
The code of The Narrows.

153
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,887
Right, well, I want to get in, grab Ed,

154
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,269
deliver him to his doom
and then go find a martini.

155
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:10,641
Okay?

156
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,811
Hello? Earth to Tabby?

157
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,022
Sorry, thinking about
getting my hands on him.

158
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,033
Yeah, as much as I hate doing
Penguin's dirty work,

159
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,237
this job is like
a little dream come true.

160
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,946
Gonna be Ed's nightmare.

161
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,997
Aren't we worried about him
setting a trap though?

162
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,332
He's a genius.

163
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,705
Well, word is, Ed lost a step
when Penguin put him on ice.

164
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,381
But, we should be ready for anything.

165
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:41,555
You insist
on persisting in this misbehavior.

166
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,681
You leave me no choice,
but to scold you.

167
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:54,318
You've asked for it!
I'm going to sic my lackeys upon you.

168
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,359
Get 'em, boys, get 'em.

169
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:05,905
Grundy! Grundy! Grundy!
Grundy! Grundy!

170
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,865
Grundy! Grundy!

171
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,628
Butch?

172
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,398
Stop hitting yourself!
Stop hitting yourself!

173
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,898
Stop hitting yourself!

174
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,824
Butch, it's Butch.
Do you know what this means?

175
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,074
Yeah, it means you owe me
an apology for electrocuting me.

176
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,996
I gotta find a way to go talk to him.

177
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,578
Have fun.

178
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,381
Tell him, it was nothing personal
when I shot him in the head.

179
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:07,349
Wow, I have got to know
what is up with this outfit.

180
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,812
Could've sworn we had a job to do here.

181
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,982
Grundy! Grundy!

182
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,463
Good morning, Harv.

183
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,259
- Where have you been?
- Sorry, got stuck in traffic.

184
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,877
What you got there?

185
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,092
It's the Bullet Hole Club today.

186
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,556
These are the slugs they pulled
from the wounded cops

187
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:52,844
in The Narrows raid.

188
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,857
It was the Pyg that set the trap.

189
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,769
But I was the one who sent
those cops in.

190
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,233
Yeah, you did.

191
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,984
But now we gotta move on,
and we gotta catch the Pyg

192
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,363
before he can hurt somebody else.

193
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,028
Yeah.

194
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,072
You're right.

195
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,868
- Captain Bullock, Detective.
- What's the word, Lucius?

196
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:20,290
The word is "absence," as in
all of Professor Pyg's crime scenes

197
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,842
demonstrate a marked absence
of useful physical evidence.

198
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,840
- How is that possible?
- He's a loony.

199
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,637
But a crafty one.

200
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,514
We have to dig deeper,

201
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,057
try and get ahead of whatever
he's planning.

202
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,677
I'm at your disposal.

203
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,889
Hey, Jim, uh,
about the Bullet Hole Club today.

204
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:42,645
I'd really appreciate it
if you could be there, too.

205
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,572
- It would just help me a lot if...
- Of course.

206
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,524
I knew you had my back, partner.

207
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,368
Of course, Harv, I got your back.

208
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,865
The Bullet Hole Club?

209
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,370
Cops shot in the line of duty.

210
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,794
- New members joining today.
- How does that work?

211
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,664
It's unofficial,
little ceremony in a bar.

212
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:05,217
Commanding officer hands them
the bullet they were shot with.

213
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,091
This batch of cops were wounded
in Pyg's trap.

214
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,797
And Harvey has to give them
their bullets?

215
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,553
Yeah, including the officer he shot.

216
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,592
No wonder he wants a friend there.

217
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,348
Yeah, no wonder.

218
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:23,231
Leave it to Ed Nygma
to find a way to turn his idiocy

219
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,438
into a tool for revenge.

220
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,570
And everything was running so tidily.

221
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,325
Now I have nothing but headaches.

222
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:34,451
No one appreciates how hard
it is to be a crime lord.

223
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,827
I did actually spend my childhood
being raised by one.

224
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:38,913
My very point.

225
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:44,298
In fact, I thought we would
have lunch together

226
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,843
and talk over the vagaries
of this capricious calling.

227
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,761
I'd love to help,
but I have to see the caterer

228
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,383
for the orphanage fundraiser.

229
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:56,678
Of course, can't expect you
to be at my beck and call.

230
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,270
You need a different source
of relaxation, Oswald.

231
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,319
You need chickens.

232
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,235
I'm sorry?

233
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,487
Do you remember my father's chickens?

234
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:20,167
I seem to recall
the Don's predilection for poultry.

235
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,291
He understood that life
couldn't just be about business.

236
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,670
When his troubles were greatest,
he spent time with his birds.

237
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,420
You think I need chickens?

238
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,547
An interest outside the business.

239
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,758
Give it some thought.
We can talk about it when I get back.

240
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,555
Chickens.

241
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,650
Chick, chick, chickens.

242
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,141
Boy, come here this instant.

243
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,059
What do you think you're doing?

244
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,699
You cannot do things like that.

245
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,410
Your enemies will know it was you.

246
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,836
Grundy! Grundy! Grundy! Grundy!

247
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,920
Butch.

248
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,268
Oh, you're alive.

249
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,644
Huh?

250
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,312
Oh, Butch.

251
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,403
What happened to you?

252
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,533
Guess who?

253
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,328
Psycho killer stalker?

254
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,333
Got it in one.

255
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,296
Please, if you were going to pop me,
you would've done it already.

256
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,719
Oh. That felt good.

257
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:37,967
I've been waiting
a long time to do that.

258
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,469
Other cheek?

259
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,971
I'm good, thanks.

260
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,518
So what are you doing
down here, Barbara?

261
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,436
This is a low rent neighborhood for you.

262
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,765
Yeah, if it wasn't for Penguin,
you wouldn't catch me dead

263
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,315
- in a place like this.
- Oh.

264
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,986
You're working as Penguin's flunky?
That suits you.

265
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,608
Yes and you seem to be thriving
with your current life choices.

266
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,949
We don't all make decisions
based on what it can get us.

267
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,322
There are other people in the world.

268
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:07,038
Wow. Sexy and self-righteous.

269
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,040
What does Jim think of this new you?

270
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,622
Jim who?

271
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,546
Well, I have to go see a man
about a kidnapping,

272
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,507
but this has been interesting.

273
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,137
Toodles, poodle.

274
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,938
Kidnapping. Oh, crap.

275
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,074
You play
a great Penguin, mister.

276
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,447
Yeah. Sure, sure, thanks, kid.

277
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,204
Oh, crud.

278
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,463
I thought you were supposed to be smart.

279
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,302
Relax, Jim, no one followed me.

280
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,642
I have Oswald wrapped around my finger.

281
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,936
If you have such a good grip on him,
explain that.

282
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:11,102
Why would he want me promoted?
What's his plan?

283
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,024
Oswald has nothing
to do with this.

284
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,477
The Commissioner and the Mayor
can feel the winds changing

285
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,439
and they want to be out
ahead of it before it blows.

286
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,534
It was you, you put them up to this.

287
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,661
You must've made a hell
of a contribution to get the Mayor

288
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,741
to defy Penguin.

289
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,953
No contribution necessary, Jim.

290
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:36,757
Just the Falcone name
and everything that it implies.

291
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,594
Well, I won't do it. Not like this

292
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,296
and not at Harvey's expense.

293
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,514
Harvey is weak.

294
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,175
How much longer do you plan
on propping him up

295
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,307
and how many more cops need
to die because of his incompetence?

296
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:56,060
I need to go and you need
to stop pretending

297
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,485
like you're not taking that job.

298
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,109
I'm not pretending.

299
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,942
So you say, Jim, but I don't see you
rushing to throw that piece of paper

300
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,151
in the trash.

301
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,824
Come see me tonight,

302
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,701
after you take command
and we'll celebrate.

303
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:20,050
Revenge is never as simple
as a mere tit for a tat.

304
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,969
Revenge must be specific in nature.

305
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:27,550
Now when you imagine revenge
against your two juvenile tormentors,

306
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,300
what do you see?

307
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,814
That might be a little overly ambitious.

308
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,774
We must be crafty.

309
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,864
For instance, friendship can be
an especially deadly tactic.

310
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,539
How do you think you might use
friendship to drive a wedge

311
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,290
between your two antagonists?

312
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,837
"They're both flunking math."

313
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:10,016
And you, I imagine,
are very good at math?

314
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,518
Excellent, tell me more.

315
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,871
Psst! Psst!

316
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,709
Hey, Martin.

317
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,463
Thank you.

318
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,816
What's wrong, Martin?

319
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,484
Who did that to you?

320
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,694
Hey.

321
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,697
Are you picking on Martin?

322
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:17,163
You like that dummy so much,
go play with him.

323
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,289
He's not a dummy.

324
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,496
Yes, he is.

325
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,296
Yeah, get him, get him!

326
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,169
Well done.

327
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,839
Feels good, does it not?

328
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,507
Minions are so much better than friends.

329
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,015
"But I'm your..."

330
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,772
The greatest friend I ever had
turned into my worst enemy.

331
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,902
Shun friendship.

332
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,783
You and I, we're more than friends.

333
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:55,914
We're conspirators.

334
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:23,975
Peekaboo.

335
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,946
Well, look at the little go-getter.

336
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,741
Yeah, well, you and Tabby
decided to freak out.

337
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,944
So someone had to be the professional.

338
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,576
Teenagers, Ed, don't you love 'em?

339
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,250
Do you remember anything, Butch?

340
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,707
Do you remember anything about us?

341
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,004
Doesn't this mean anything to you?

342
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,391
- Ed?
- Butch.

343
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,192
Tell zombie Butch to back off.

344
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,860
Grundy kill everyone!

345
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,735
Butch, Ed is not your friend.

346
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:11,940
Rip 'em to pieces.

347
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,195
Butch!

348
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,527
All right, everybody, just take it easy.

349
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,621
Selina, what are you doing
with these two?

350
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:19,948
Looking for trouble.

351
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,499
Well, you found plenty of it
trying to take Ed.

352
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,837
- Let him go.
- You're such a bleeding heart, Lee.

353
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:28,085
I thought you changed, but turns out

354
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,882
you just got a new hairdo.

355
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,006
Code of The Narrows,
code of The Narrows.

356
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:37,091
Let's settle it in the ring,
champion against champion.

357
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,265
The winner would take Ed.

358
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,682
So, your best fighter
against my fighter?

359
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,230
Yeah, let's do that.

360
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:00,780
Honk-honk, honk-honk.

361
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:05,460
You Narrows trash have been very,
very naughty.

362
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,543
You've been hiding someone from me.

363
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,838
Don't listen to him, he's not my friend.

364
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,136
No, Ed, no one's gonna save you.

365
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,221
Grundy.

366
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,173
No one can save you. Save me.

367
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,471
Help, help, save me.

368
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:34,530
Ladies and Grundy fans.

369
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,534
Tonight is a special edition
of Fight Night.

370
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,784
A good old Narrows grudge match.

371
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:45,333
Winner takes me.

372
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:53,880
And featuring your champion,
Solomon Grundy.

373
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:58,592
Versus Tabby.

374
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,303
The tigress.

375
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,352
- Tabs, I know this was my idea...
- No, it's okay.

376
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,767
Butch is still in there, I know he is.

377
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,227
He loves me too much to hurt me.

378
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:15,280
Grundy kill!

379
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,993
Babe, I love your faith,
but I really think you should take this.

380
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:25,373
No, he won't hurt me,
I'll just choke him out, no problem.

381
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,301
Tabitha and Grundy were lovers,
before he got this way.

382
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,103
What if he goes easy on her?

383
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:51,524
Grundy will win,
not that it makes a difference anyway.

384
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,148
What does that mean?

385
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:59,024
The Penguin wants Ed,
he's gonna get him.

386
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:11,290
Come on, Butch,
I know you could never forget me.

387
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,376
You're still in there, I know it.

388
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,717
Grundy.

389
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,264
Tabby, get up! Come on, Tabs.
Come on, get up!

390
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,767
Get up. Tabby, get up.

391
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:33,224
- No! No, Butch! No! Butch!
- Tabs!

392
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,624
<i>Hey, Butch.</i>

393
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:13,556
Tabby?

394
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,016
Oh!

395
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:18,561
Butch?

396
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:44,678
Come on, buddy.

397
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,302
Are you Detective Gordon?

398
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,051
Yeah.

399
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,144
Harvey said as how
I should give this to you.

400
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,056
Said you'd know what to do with it.

401
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,808
When was he here?

402
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,694
A couple of hours ago,

403
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,650
before you all started coming in here.

404
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:03,814
Thanks.

405
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,940
Come on, Butch. Come on, baby, wake up.

406
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,735
- Come on, Butch, come on, baby.
- Tabitha, we gotta go, now.

407
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,232
Ladies, let's am-scray.

408
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,572
- Come on.
- I'll come back for you, Butch.

409
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,992
What happened to this
code of The Narrows?

410
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,745
Give me up, Barbara.
You're getting out of here empty-handed.

411
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,963
In the name of Penguin,
everybody back the hell off.

412
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:48,128
Look at that, cavalry.

413
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,381
Not so fast.
Boss gave you a deadline.

414
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,050
- You missed it.
- So what?

415
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:57,057
We got Ed,
we are literally champions here.

416
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,730
What you are is
four courses of barbecue.

417
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,683
Crispy skin.

418
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,280
Grundy, wake up.

419
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,569
Grundy, get up, big guy. Come on.

420
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:20,793
Grundy kill!

421
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:33,344
What's the matter, gruesome?
Afraid of fire?

422
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,392
Come on, Bridgit, don't do this,
you're from The Narrows.

423
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,765
Yeah, and I couldn't be happier
to be out.

424
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:43,357
Penguin's right about this place.
It's a sewer.

425
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,899
Only way to kill the stink
is to burn it.

426
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,902
Hey, Firefly, you're the only thing
that stinks around here.

427
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:04,329
You know what you've done?
Firefly is Penguin's enforcer.

428
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,794
And who is the one that
got Firefly down here, Cherry?

429
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,507
She informed on Ed to Penguin.

430
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,338
What?

431
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,761
Shut up.

432
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,389
Shut up.

433
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,017
This is my club, it's my turf.

434
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,940
You guys just do what you're told
like the scum you are.

435
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,697
They're the ones that are the problem.

436
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,280
They work for Penguin.

437
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,408
Oh!

438
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:46,963
I would like to announce
that we just quit working for Penguin.

439
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,214
Whoo!

440
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,223
Well, they sure love their
cold-blooded murder down here, huh?

441
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,555
Yeah, well, we better split
before they decide they want more.

442
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:08,477
Hey, it's okay, big guy, Fire Lady,
she can't hurt you.

443
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:11,937
Grundy safe.

444
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,885
Where were you, Harvey?

445
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,674
Hey, Jim.

446
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,269
I was just having a

447
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,180
little drinkie-poo.

448
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,103
Why don't you join me?

449
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,897
- Not right now.
- Come on, Jim,

450
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,649
don't be like that, come on, sit down

451
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:54,898
and have a drink with me.

452
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,201
Those cops were waiting for you.

453
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,333
Yeah, to spit in my face.

454
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:15,547
If that's what they wanted to do,
you owed it to them to be there.

455
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,969
You stand in front of them,
look each one in the eye.

456
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,059
If you'd have done that,

457
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,889
maybe you couldn've
gotten their respect.

458
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,394
I don't deserve their respect.

459
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:38,695
Jim, I shot Officer Patel,
what the hell was I supposed to do?

460
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,574
Stand in front of her and hand her
the bullet that I shot her with

461
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:43,780
that came from my gun?

462
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,909
That's the job.

463
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,751
Take responsibility for what happens
to your cops, that's the job.

464
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,499
Oh.

465
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:57,468
So now,
you're telling me what the job is?

466
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:03,716
Yeah.

467
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:11,441
Today, Jim, I just couldn't do the job.

468
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:19,407
So I sent you, because I knew you could.

469
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,318
It's not good enough.

470
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,655
Not today.

471
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:28,620
They needed you there.

472
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:34,543
Well, ain't nothing
that I can do about it now.

473
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,514
You got a pen?

474
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,224
For what?

475
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,782
Harvey Bullock,
you are relieved of duty.

476
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:14,203
As of this moment, I'm assuming
the Captaincy of Gotham Central.

477
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,583
Well, well,

478
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,630
look who finally got
what he always wanted.

479
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,382
But what I'm wondering is,

480
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,635
what did you have to do to get it?

481
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:35,191
- All I did was my job, same as...
- Nothing in Gotham is free.

482
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:38,936
Captain Gordon.

483
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,868
You just better hope you can pay up
when your bill's due.

484
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:55,832
And it'll come due.

485
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,018
Huh?

486
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,390
Now you try.

487
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,568
Ah. You've met Martin, I see.

488
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,449
Shh. He's practicing.

489
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,071
No, it's...

490
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,209
Upward, Martin, so that way you drive
the blade under the ribs

491
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,661
- and into the heart.
- Oswald.

492
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,456
Entirely theoretically speaking,
of course.

493
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:50,050
- Mr. Penn?
- Urgent matters, Mr. Cobblepot.

494
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:54,061
It seems that Miss Kean
and her associates have failed

495
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:55,558
to retrieve Mr. Nygma.

496
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,107
- Did you dispatch Firefly?
- I did.

497
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,986
And Ms. Firefly was herself
in turn, disabled.

498
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,104
What?

499
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,782
- There's more.
- Yes!

500
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:11,821
The mayor at his own discretion
has seen fit to promote

501
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,532
Detective Gordon to the rank of Captain.

502
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,750
That is, um...

503
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:31,052
That is quite a lot
to go awry in one day.

504
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:37,100
Very good, Mr. Cobblepot.

505
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,228
You see, Oswald,
business is not the end-all of life.

506
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:47,281
There are other rewards to be had.
Companionship, peace of mind.

507
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,067
Friendship.

508
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,494
Oh. I have to get back to the estate,

509
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,200
I still have so much to do
for the fundraiser.

510
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,626
Will you be joining me later for dinner?

511
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,123
I think not.

512
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,540
- Martin needs some more practice.
- Okay.

513
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:12,881
Martin.

514
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,133
Remind me.

515
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,102
What did we learn today?

516
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:21,019
What did we learn about friendship?

517
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,188
Exactly.

518
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:33,161
Sometimes if you're not very careful,
friendship can blind you

519
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,909
to what is staring you
right in the face.

520
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,763
"Hey, Firefly.

521
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,307
"You're the only thing
that stinks around here."

522
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,477
I get melodramatic under pressure.

523
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,941
How are you feeling, big fella?

524
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:08,813
Grundy confused.

525
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,943
Yeah, tell me about it.

526
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,327
What's with them?

527
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,454
They're, uh...

528
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,002
They're acknowledging their new leader.

529
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,173
Well, like I said, they love you.

530
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,176
Uh, Lee, I'm supposed to be
the stupid one.

531
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,476
You heal their children,
you stitch up their warriors.

532
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,976
You've slain a fire breathing monster
and you've helped topple the queen.

533
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,266
This is your turf now.

534
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,232
No, no, no, I am not a leader.

535
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,188
Okay, well, if you don't do it,
somebody else will.

536
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,443
Probably worse than Cherry.

537
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,582
Where do I start?

538
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:12,589
I don't know, just make 'em happy,
give 'em something to cheer for.

539
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,298
Drinks on the house!

540
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,471
Good move.

541
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,240
Why, Captain Gordon,

542
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,000
you came to celebrate after all.

543
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:46,919
I'm not here to celebrate.

544
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,127
What's wrong?
I made you captain, didn't I?

545
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,298
You made me?

546
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,135
Is that what you think?

547
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:57,921
Jim.

548
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,552
You can toy with Penguin all you want.

549
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,345
But I am not your puppet.

550
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,766
No, you're not. You're my partner.

551
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:06,555
Your partner?

552
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,188
I just stuck a knife
in my partner's back.

553
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,855
A mercy killing, if you ask me.

554
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:17,983
Grow up.

555
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,987
You wanted a gangster to help you
get rid of Penguin.

556
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,947
This is what that help looks like.

557
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:28,206
Harvey had to go.

558
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,214
I don't need your help anymore.

559
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,339
I think it's time you left Gotham.

560
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,552
I'm not going anywhere, Jim.

561
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:50,020
I came to restore the Falcone name
and that's exactly

562
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,725
what I'm going to do.

563
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:55,859
So, do you want to come in
and celebrate, Captain?

564
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,694
I think I'll stay out here
where I can breathe.
