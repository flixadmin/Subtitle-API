1
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,439
Honey, have you seen my wallet?

2
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,151
ALICE:
Isn't it on the bedside table?

3
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,202
Now listen, we're running a little late.

4
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,453
ALICE:
I know.

5
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:20,538
How do I look?

6
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,207
Perfect.

7
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,125
Is my hair okay?

8
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,752
It's great.

9
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,046
You're not even looking at it.

10
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:30,715
It's beautiful.

11
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,842
You always look beautiful.

12
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:35,387
Did you give Roz the phone
and pager numbers?

13
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,056
BILL: Yeah, I put it on the fridge.
Let's go.

14
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:39,266
Coming.

15
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,726
All right.

16
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:43,186
I'm ready.

17
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,913
What's the babysitter's name?

18
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,081
Roz.

19
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:08,461
Okay, Roz, we're going now.

20
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,506
ROZ:
You look amazing, Mrs. Harford.

21
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:14,050
Thank you.
Helena, are you ready for bed?

22
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,886
Yes, Mommy. Can I stay up
and watch The Nutcracker?

23
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,014
ALICE: What time's it on?
-9:00.

24
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:21,850
- You can watch that.
- Can I stay up until you get home?

25
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,145
- No, darling.
BILL: It'll be a little late for that.

26
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:27,605
The phone number is on the fridge...

27
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,483
...and there's food in there,
so help yourself.

28
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:32,444
We shouldn't be later than 1:00.

29
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:35,363
- I'll hold our cab to take you home.
- Thanks, Dr. Harford.

30
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:37,574
ALICE: You be good, baby.
HELENA: Good night, Daddy.

31
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,577
BILL: Good night, sweetheart.
ALICE: See you in the morning.

32
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,876
(BAND PLAYS)

33
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:53,131
- Victor, lllona.
VICTOR: Bill, Alice.

34
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,884
VICTOR: Merry Christmas.
ILLONA: Thank you for coming.

35
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,722
- Thanks so much for coming.
- We wouldn't miss it for the world.

36
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,017
Alice, look at you.
God, you're absolutely stunning!

37
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,144
I don't say that to all the women.
Do I?

38
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:08,104
- Yes, he does.
- He does?

39
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:11,316
That osteopath you sent me to,
the guy that worked on my arm?

40
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,903
- You ought to see my serve now.
- He's the top man in New York.

41
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,614
I could have told you that,
looking at his bill.

42
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,241
Go inside, have a drink,
enjoy the party.

43
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:23,161
I'll see you in a little bit.
Thanks for coming.

44
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,176
Do you know anyone here?

45
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:42,013
BILL:
Not a soul.

46
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:54,317
Why do you think Ziegler invites us
to these things every year?

47
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:59,989
This is what you get
for making house calls.

48
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:13,294
You see that guy at the piano?

49
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:17,048
I went to medical school with him.

50
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,591
Really?

51
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,389
He plays pretty good for a doctor.

52
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,768
He's not a doctor. He dropped out.

53
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,315
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you're enjoying yourselves.

54
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,986
The band's going to take a break.
We'll be back in 10 minutes.

55
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:39,696
Thank you.

56
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,788
Let's go over and say hello.

57
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:51,416
I desperately need
to go to the bathroom.

58
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:55,628
You go and say hello, and I'll
meet you where? At the bar?

59
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,213
Good.

60
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,100
BILL:
Nightingale.

61
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,102
Nick Nightingale!

62
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,605
Oh, my God! Bill.

63
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:17,025
Bill Harford!
How the hell are you, buddy?

64
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,653
- How long has it been?
- I don't know. Ten years?

65
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,197
And a couple.

66
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,616
- Do you have time for a drink?
- Sure.

67
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:30,872
You haven't changed a bit.

68
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,958
Thanks, I think.
So how you doing?

69
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,878
Not too bad, you know. Not too bad.

70
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,380
I see you've become a pianist.

71
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,133
Oh, yes, well, my friends call me that.

72
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:45,595
How about you?
You still in the doctor business?

73
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:49,849
You know what they say:
"Once a doctor, always a doctor. "

74
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:54,354
Yes, or in my case:
"Never a doctor, never a doctor. "

75
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,607
I never did understand
why you walked away.

76
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,693
It's a nice feeling. I do it a lot.

77
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,111
Cheers.

78
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:06,115
Excuse me.
Nick, I need you a minute.

79
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,951
Be right with you.

80
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,828
I gotta go do something.
If I don't catch you later...

81
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,832
...I'll be down at the Village
for two weeks at the Sonata Café.

82
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,710
- Stop by if you get a chance.
- I'll be there.

83
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:21,506
- It's great seeing you.
- Good seeing you too, man.

84
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:06,426
I think that's my glass.

85
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,762
I'm absolutely certain of it.

86
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,780
My name is Sandor Szavost.
I'm Hungarian.

87
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,835
My name is Alice Harford.

88
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,212
I'm American.

89
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,798
Delighted to meet you, Alice.

90
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:52,138
Did you ever read the Latin poet Ovid
on The Art of Love?

91
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,894
Didn't he wind up all by himself...

92
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,855
...crying his eyes out...

93
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:04,817
...in some place
with a very bad climate?

94
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,946
But he also had a good time first.

95
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,741
A very good time.

96
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,996
Are you here
with anyone tonight, Alice?

97
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,168
With my husband.

98
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,462
Oh, how sad.

99
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:30,093
But then I'm sure he's the sort of man
who wouldn't mind if we danced.

100
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:37,141
What do you do, Alice?

101
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:41,062
Well, at the moment...

102
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,232
...I'm looking for a job.

103
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:49,153
I used to manage
an art gallery in SoHo.

104
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:51,948
But it went broke.

105
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,576
What a shame.

106
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,831
I have some friends in the art game.

107
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,709
Perhaps I can be of some help.

108
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,131
Thank you.

109
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,943
Someone you know?

110
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,490
My...

111
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,576
...husband.

112
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:37,952
Oh.

113
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,292
Don't you think
one of the charms of marriage...

114
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:49,172
...is that it makes deception
a necessity for both parties?

115
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,678
May I ask why a beautiful woman...

116
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,849
...who could have any man in this room,
wants to be married?

117
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,812
Why wouldn't she?

118
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,691
Is it as bad as that?

119
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,361
As good as that.

120
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,864
Do you know Nuala Windsor?

121
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:19,702
No, and it's very lovely
to meet you both.

122
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,748
How do you spell Nuala?

123
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:29,295
N- U-A-L-A.

124
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,800
You don't remember me, do you?

125
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,553
You were very kind to me once.

126
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:41,516
Only once?
That sounds like a terrible oversight!

127
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:47,104
I was doing a photo session
in Rockefeller Plaza...

128
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,898
...on a very windy day...?

129
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:53,319
- And you got something in your eye.
- Just about half of Fifth Avenue.

130
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:57,240
You were such a gentleman!
You gave me your handkerchief...

131
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,951
...which was also clean.

132
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,331
That is the kind of hero
I can be sometimes.

133
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,418
You know why women used to get married,
don't you?

134
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:13,172
Why don't you tell me?

135
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,885
It was the only way they could
lose their virginity...

136
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,889
...and be free to do
what they wanted with other men.

137
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,142
The ones they really wanted.

138
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,816
Fascinating.

139
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,532
Do you know what's so nice
about doctors?

140
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,662
Usually a lot less than people imagine.

141
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,000
They always seem so...

142
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,460
...knowledgeable.

143
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:56,299
Oh, they are very knowledgeable...

144
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,385
...about all sorts of things.

145
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,472
But I bet they work too hard.

146
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:07,768
Just think of all they miss.

147
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,022
You're probably right.

148
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:16,819
Ladies, where exactly are we going?

149
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,030
Exactly?

150
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,035
Where the rainbow ends.

151
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,495
Where the rainbow ends?

152
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:30,166
Don't you want to go
where the rainbow ends?

153
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,461
Now that depends where that is.

154
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,338
Well, let's find out.

155
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,382
Excuse me, ladies.
Sorry, Dr. Harford.

156
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:42,887
Could you come with me for a moment?
Something for Mr. Ziegler.

157
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,390
Fine.

158
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,560
To be continued?

159

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

160
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:09,872
Yeah.

161
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:14,460
Bill, thanks for coming.

162
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,340
We had a little accident here.

163
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,092
BILL:
What happened?

164
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,552
VICTOR:
Well, she was...

165
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:28,224
She was shooting up
and she had a bad reaction.

166
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,227
BILL:
What did she take?

167
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:35,731
A speedball or a snowball
or whatever the hell they call it.

168
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,775
It's heroin and coke.

169
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,738
BILL:
Heroin and coke?

170
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,575
Anything else?

171
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:51,497
We had a couple of drinks,
some champagne. That was it.

172
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,666
How long has she been like this?

173
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:57,336
Maybe five minutes, six minutes,
something like that.

174
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:58,671
What's her name?

175
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,048
Mandy.

176
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:05,886
Mandy?

177
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,681
Mandy?

178
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,476
Can you hear me, Mandy?

179
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:17,440
Can you hear me?
Move your head if you can hear me.

180
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:22,028
Move your head if you can
hear me, Mandy. There you go.

181
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,821
You can hear me.

182
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:28,242
Can you open your eyes for me?
Mandy, can you do that?

183
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,288
Let me see you open your eyes.
There you go, come on.

184
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,499
Come on, look at me. Look at me.

185
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:38,544
Look at me. Look at me.

186
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,465
Look at me. Look at me, Mandy.

187
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,134
Good.

188
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,012
Good.

189
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:53,267
I love Victor's art collection,
don't you?

190
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:56,854
Yes.

191
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:59,065
It's wonderful.

192
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,569
Have you ever seen
his sculpture gallery?

193
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:06,739
No.

194
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,575
I haven't.

195
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:15,164
He has a wonderful collection
of Renaissance bronzes.

196
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,502
Do you like the period?

197
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,381
I do.

198
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,176
I adore it.

199
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,722
The sculpture gallery is upstairs.

200
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:35,184
Would you like to see it?

201
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,064
I can show it to you.

202
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,569
We won't be gone long.

203
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,787
Maybe...

204
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,584
...not just...

205
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,170
...now.

206
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:25,484
That was really one hell
of a scare you gave us, kiddo.

207
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,404
Sorry.

208
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,540
How are you feeling now, Mandy?

209
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:42,710
Better.

210
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:56,807
You are a very, very lucky girl.

211
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,310
You know that?

212
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:03,147
I know.

213
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,525
You're gonna be okay this time.

214
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:11,030
But you can't keep doing this.

215
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,282
You understand?

216
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,785
Yeah.

217
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:21,582
You're going to need some rehab.
You know that, don't you?

218
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,960
I know.

219
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,464
Okay.

220
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,425
Okay.

221
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,348
Well, Victor...

222
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,101
...I'll leave the rest to you.

223
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:44,063
Is it okay if I dress her
and get her out of here?

224
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:47,983
No, I'd keep her here
for another hour.

225
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,693
Another hour?

226
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:54,531
Then I'd have someone take her home.

227
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,244
Okay. Okay.

228
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,081
Good night, Mandy.

229
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,791
Listen...

230
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,253
I can't thank you enough for this.

231
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,214
- You saved my ass.
- I'm glad I was here.

232
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,883
Bill, I probably...

233
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:17,263
I know I don't have to mention this...

234
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:20,391
...but this is just between us.

235
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,142
Of course.

236
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:23,936
Thanks.

237
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:49,545
I think I've had
a little too much champagne.

238
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:56,260
I think I have to go
and find my husband now.

239
00:18:56,469 --> 00:19:01,098
But I'm sure he'll be all right
on his own a little longer.

240
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,019
Yes...

241
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,063
...but will I?

242
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,441
Of course you will.

243
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,778
No.

244
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:19,408
I really have to go.
I have to go.

245
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,410
You don't, you know.

246
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,748
Yes, I do.

247
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,167
Alice?

248
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,921
I must see you again.

249
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,343
- That's impossible.
- Why?

250
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,596
Because...

251
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,434
...I'm married.

252
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,792
BILL:
Good morning, Lisa.

253
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,128
Good morning, doctor.
Your mail.

254
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:57,256
Good. Please ask Janelle
to bring me my coffee.

255
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,091
- Sure.
- Thank you.

256
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:02,636
- Good morning, Sarah.
- Good morning, doctor.

257
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:05,889
<i>"'Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house...</i>

258
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,976
<i>...not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse. "</i>

259
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,732
Okay. That's fine.
You can put your gown on.

260
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:22,156
Hold this for Mommy.

261
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,534
- Looking forward to Christmas?
- Yeah.

262
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,328
- Does this hurt?
- Yeah.

263
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,927
- Right there?
- Yeah.

264
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,815
Daddy's gonna like that.

265
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,234
Very good choice.

266
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,362
"- before me...

267
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:07,826
...when I jump into my bed. "

268
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,999
We should call the Zieglers
and thank them for the party.

269
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,793
BILL:
I've taken care of that.

270
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,796
ALICE:
Good.

271
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:24,134
So how do you feel about wrapping
the rest of the presents?

272
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:28,013
Let's do that tomorrow.

273
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,186
Tell me something.

274
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:24,444
Those two girls...

275
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,907
...at the party last night...

276
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,748
Did you...

277
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,127
...by any chance...

278
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:42,838
...happen to...

279
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:47,301
...fuck them?

280
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,263
What?

281
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,852
What are you talking about?

282
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:04,526
I'm talking about the two girls...

283
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:08,697
...that you were so blatantly
hitting on.

284
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:13,452
I wasn't hitting on anybody.

285
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:18,498
Who were they?

286
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:25,464
They were just a couple of models.

287
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:34,056
And where did you disappear to
with them for so long?

288
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,224
Wait a minute.

289
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,810
Wait a minute.

290
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:44,608
I didn't disappear with anybody.

291
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:50,030
Ziegler wasn't feeling too well...

292
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:53,742
...and I got called upstairs
to see him.

293
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,499
Anyway, who was the guy
you were dancing with?

294
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:09,549
A friend of the Zieglers.

295
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,637
What did he want?

296
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,931
What did he want?

297
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,976
What did he want?

298
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,272
Sex...

299
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,276
...upstairs.

300
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,238
Then and there.

301
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:35,200
Is that all?

302
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:38,120
Yeah, that was all.

303
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:41,123
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

304
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,962
That's right.

305
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,589
Well, I guess that's understandable.

306
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,761
Understandable?

307
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,806
Because you are a very...

308
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,017
...very beautiful woman.

309
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,436
Whoa.

310
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,854
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

311
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:05,480
Wait.

312
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,153
Because I'm a beautiful woman...

313
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:15,657
...the only reason any man
ever wants to talk to me...

314
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:21,872
...is because he wants to fuck me.
Is that what you're saying?

315
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:29,337
Well, I don't think it's quite
that black and white...

316
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:36,344
...but I think we both know
what men are like.

317
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:40,348
So on that basis...

318
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:45,520
...I should conclude that you
wanted to fuck those two models.

319
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,484
There are exceptions.

320
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:56,031
And what makes you an exception?

321
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:02,454
What makes me an exception is that...

322
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:06,124
...I happen to be in love with you.

323
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,794
And because we're married...

324
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:13,298
...and because I would never
lie to you...

325
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,550
...or hurt you.

326
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:27,270
Do you realize that
what you're saying...

327
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:30,899
...is that the only reason you
wouldn't fuck those models...

328
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:33,652
...is out of consideration for me?

329
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:36,905
Not because you really
wouldn't want to.

330
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:40,033
Let's just relax, Alice.

331
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:42,828
This pot is making you aggressive.

332
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:46,456
No! It's not the pot. It's you!

333
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:49,292
Why can't you ever give me
a straight fucking answer?

334
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:52,087
I was under the impression
that's what I was doing.

335
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:55,507
I don't even know
what we're arguing about here.

336
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,926
I'm not arguing.

337
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:03,181
I'm just trying to find out
where you're coming from.

338
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:05,141
Where I'm coming from?

339
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:14,317
Let's say, for example,
you have some gorgeous woman...

340
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:18,655
...standing in your office naked...

341
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:21,533
...and you're feeling her fucking tits.

342
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,535
Now, what I want to know...

343
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:28,748
I want to know what you're thinking
about when you're squeezing them.

344
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:33,086
Alice, I happen to be a doctor.

345
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,881
It's all very impersonal...

346
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,676
...and you know
there's always a nurse present.

347
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:45,098
So when you're feeling tits, it's
nothing more than your professionalism?

348
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:46,349
Exactly.

349
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,104
Sex is the last thing on my mind
when I'm with a patient.

350
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:56,568
Now, when she is having
her little titties squeezed...

351
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,029
...do you think she ever
has fantasies...

352
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:03,533
...about what handsome Dr. Bill's
dickie might be like?

353
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:09,915
Come on, I can assure you
sex is the last thing...

354
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:14,377
...on this fucking hypothetical
woman patient's mind.

355
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:16,504
And what makes you so sure?

356
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,553
If for no better reason...

357
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,057
...because she's afraid of
what I might find.

358
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:32,729
So after you tell her that
everything's fine, what then?

359
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,190
What then?

360
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,818
I don't know, Alice...

361
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:41,655
What then?

362
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:47,535
Women don't...

363
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:52,207
They basically just don't
think like that.

364
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:58,046
Millions of years of evolution, right?

365
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:02,342
Men have to stick it
every place they can...

366
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,762
...but for women, it is just about
security and commitment...

367
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,223
...and whatever the fuck else!

368
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:12,185
A little oversimplified, Alice.
But yes, something like that.

369
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:16,356
If you men only knew.

370
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:21,861
What I do know is you got stoned,
you tried to pick a fight...

371
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:25,198
...and now you're trying
to make me jealous.

372
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:27,575
But you're not the jealous type,
are you?

373
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:28,910
No, I'm not.

374
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,204
You've never been jealous about me,
have you?

375
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:32,414
No, I haven't.

376
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:35,125
And why haven't you ever
been jealous about me?

377
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:39,295
Well, I don't know, Alice.
Maybe because you're my wife.

378
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:41,881
Maybe because you're
the mother of my child...

379
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:44,884
...and I know you would never
be unfaithful to me.

380
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:49,389
You are very, very sure of yourself...

381
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:50,890
...aren't you?

382
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:52,600
No.

383
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:55,103
I'm sure of you.

384
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,200
Do you think that's funny?

385
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,919
All right. Fuck it.

386
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:24,507
Now we get
the fucking laughing fit, right?

387
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:37,437
Do you...

388
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:43,276
Do you remember
last summer at Cape Cod?

389
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,406
Yes.

390
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:53,286
Do you remember one night
in the dining room...

391
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:55,663
...there was this young naval officer...

392
00:31:55,873 --> 00:32:00,460
...and he was sitting near our table
with two other officers?

393
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,004
BILL:
No.

394
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:09,844
The waiter brought him a message,
at which point he left.

395
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:12,722
Nothing rings a bell?

396
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:14,766
No.

397
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,688
Well...

398
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:26,694
...I first saw him
that morning in the lobby.

399
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:30,198
He was checking into the hotel...

400
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:33,910
...and he was following the bellboy
with his luggage...

401
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,579
...to the elevator.

402
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:45,505
He glanced at me as he walked past.
Just a glance.

403
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,508
Nothing more.

404
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,977
But I could hardly...

405
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,230
...move.

406
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:13,408
That afternoon...

407
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:19,747
...Helena went to the movies
with her friend...

408
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:25,628
...and you and I made love.

409
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:33,261
And we made plans about our future...

410
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:38,391
...and we talked about Helena.

411
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:41,769
And yet...

412
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:45,607
...at no time...

413
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:49,569
...was he ever...

414
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:54,532
...out of my mind.

415
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:04,918
And I thought if he wanted me...

416
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:09,297
...even if it was only...

417
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,675
...for one night...

418
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:20,683
...I was ready to give up everything.

419
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:23,811
You.

420
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,899
Helena.

421
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:34,239
My whole fucking future.

422
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:38,117
Everything.

423
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:49,045
And yet it was weird,
because at the same time...

424
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:52,966
...you were dearer to me than ever.

425
00:34:57,471 --> 00:35:00,556
And at that moment, my love for you...

426
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,435
...was both...

427
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:11,943
...tender and sad.

428
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,540
I barely slept that night...

429
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:31,754
...and I woke up the next morning
in a panic.

430
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:37,885
I didn't know whether I was
afraid that he had left...

431
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:42,724
...or that he might still be there.

432
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:50,273
But by dinner...

433
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:56,779
...I realized he was gone...

434
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:05,413
...and I was...

435
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:08,416
...relieved.

436

Hello?

438
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,238
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

439
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:47,288
When did it happen?

440
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,252
No. No.

441
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,755
I have the address.

442
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,882
Thank you.

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,809
Lou Nathanson just died.

I think I have to go over there

- Hello, Rosa.
- Good evening, Dr. Harford.

447
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:21,174
- How is Miss Nathanson?
- Not so good. She's in the bedroom.

448
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:22,550
Thank you.

MARION:
Oh, Dr. Harford...

452
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:53,623
How good of you to come.

453
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,292
I came as soon as I got the message.

454
00:38:56,502 --> 00:38:57,752
Thank you.

455
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:01,964
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

456
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:03,966
Your father was...

457
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,929
He was a very brave man.

458
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:10,223
Oh, thank you.

459
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:12,642
How are you holding up?

460
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,646
I'm a bit numb.

461
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,982
I don't think it's really sunk in yet.

462
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,402
Would you like to sit down?

463
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,393
It's so unreal.

464
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:58,729
Daddy had such a good day.

465
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:05,319
His mind was clear,
and he remembered so many things.

466
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:10,533
Then he had a little dinner...

467
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:14,161
...and he said he felt like
taking a nap.

468
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:20,376
I went into the kitchen and talked
to Rosa for half an hour at most...

469
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:24,839
...and when I went to see how he was...

470
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,341
...I just thought he was asleep.

471
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:36,392
Then I realized he wasn't breathing.

472
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,230
Marion...

473
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,774
From what you've said...

474
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:48,029
...I'm sure your father died peacefully
in his sleep.

475
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:52,033
Oh, God, I hope so.

476
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:59,206
I think I've been more afraid of
the way it was going to happen...

477
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,959
...than his death itself.

478
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:06,505
Have you had a chance to phone
any of your relatives?

479
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,137
I tried to call my stepmother in London,
but she was out.

480
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:16,557
My boyfriend, Carl,
is making some calls...

481
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:19,602
...and he'll be coming over soon.

482
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,276
I think you've met Carl here
a few times.

483
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:31,656
Yes, I remember him.
He's a teacher, isn't he?

484
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:33,908
A math professor.

485
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:40,623
We're going to get married in May.

Well, that's wonderful news.

Thank you.

Carl has a new teaching appointment
at the University of Michigan.

489
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,393
We'll be moving out there soon.

490

- Who do you normally play with?
- Anybody, anywhere.

I got another gig later tonight.

00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,227
You're playing somewhere else tonight?

654
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:03,146
They only get started around 2.

655
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:05,148
In the Village?

656
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,779
Believe it or not, I don't actually
know the address yet.

You don't?

No. It may sound ridiculous, but it's
in a different place every time...

659
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,664
...and I only get it
an hour or so before.

660
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:23,541
- A different place every time?
- So far.

Hey, man, I just play the piano.

No, it's the truth.

the blindfold wasn't on so well.

Sorry.

You should have a cloak

Okay, that's $74.50.

over the meter, right?

I'll make that a hundred,
if you wait for me.

Just let the meter run.

plus the meter when I get back.

01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:04,568
...hundreds of them, everywhere.

976
01:37:04,778 --> 01:37:07,321
Everyone was fucking.

977
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:14,704
And then I...

978
01:37:17,791 --> 01:37:20,292
I was fucking other men.

979
01:37:21,003 --> 01:37:22,712
So many...

980
01:37:24,297 --> 01:37:27,133
...I don't know how many I was with.

981
01:37:30,262 --> 01:37:35,141
And I knew you could see me
in the arms of all these men...

982
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:40,896
...just fucking all these men.

983
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,112
I wanted to make fun of you...

984
01:37:49,823 --> 01:37:52,241
...to laugh in your face.

985
01:37:55,537 --> 01:38:00,499
And so I laughed as loud as I could.

986
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:17,767
That must have been
when you woke me up.

987
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:03,479
Shit!

988
01:39:37,597 --> 01:39:39,765
- Hi.
- Hi.

989
01:39:40,559 --> 01:39:42,643
I'll just have a cup of coffee, please.

990
01:39:50,110 --> 01:39:51,360
Anything else?

991
01:39:52,654 --> 01:39:54,405
No, thank you.

992
01:40:01,246 --> 01:40:02,621
Excuse me.

993
01:40:03,623 --> 01:40:06,792
Do you know when they get in
next door at the Sonata Café?

994
01:40:07,002 --> 01:40:10,421
I think there's usually someone
in the office around 2 or 3.

995
01:40:14,968 --> 01:40:19,471
I don't suppose, by any chance,
you know Nick Nightingale?

996
01:40:19,681 --> 01:40:22,641
He's playing piano
over there right now.

997
01:40:22,934 --> 01:40:24,435
Nick Nightingale?

998
01:40:24,853 --> 01:40:27,438
Sure, he comes in here.

999
01:40:30,275 --> 01:40:33,027
Look, maybe you can help me...

1000
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:36,864
...because it's important that
I get in touch with him.

1001
01:40:38,074 --> 01:40:39,825
Do you know where he's staying?

1002
01:40:40,493 --> 01:40:41,660
Well...

1003
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:46,582
I don't know if he'd want me
to give out his address.

1004
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:49,168
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

1005
01:40:49,461 --> 01:40:51,921
I'm actually an old friend of his.

1006
01:40:53,506 --> 01:40:55,007
Well, doctor...

1007
01:40:57,510 --> 01:41:01,138
...he'll be playing there tonight.
Can't it wait until then?

1008
01:41:02,891 --> 01:41:03,891
Listen...

1009
01:41:04,142 --> 01:41:06,060
To be perfectly honest...

1010
01:41:08,355 --> 01:41:10,105
...it's a medical matter.

1011
01:41:10,523 --> 01:41:14,818
Some tests. I know he'll want to
know about them as soon as possible.

1012
01:41:42,013 --> 01:41:43,013
Excuse me.

1013
01:41:44,724 --> 01:41:46,934
Hi! How can I help you?

1014
01:41:47,143 --> 01:41:50,896
Can you please ring
Mr. Nightingale's room for me?

1015
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:55,067
I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Nightingale
has already checked out.

1016
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,653
- He checked out?
- Yes.

1017
01:42:00,907 --> 01:42:04,868
- Did he leave a forwarding address?
- No, I'm afraid not.

1018
01:42:06,162 --> 01:42:07,997
When did he check out?

1019
01:42:09,499 --> 01:42:11,458
About 5:00 this morning.

1020
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:13,043
5:00?

1021
01:42:14,754 --> 01:42:16,672
That's an early checkout, isn't it?

1022
01:42:16,881 --> 01:42:19,675
It is a little on the early side, yeah.

1023
01:42:20,885 --> 01:42:21,969
Look...

1024
01:42:23,763 --> 01:42:26,682
Did you notice anything...

1025
01:42:27,017 --> 01:42:28,475
...I don't know...

1026
01:42:29,144 --> 01:42:32,187
...unusual about him when he left?

1027
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:35,607
Unusual?

1028
01:42:37,193 --> 01:42:39,194
Hey, you're not Five-O, are you?

1029
01:42:40,739 --> 01:42:42,114
No, I'm an old friend of his.

1030
01:42:42,324 --> 01:42:43,449
Really?

1031
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:45,409
I'm a doctor.

1032
01:42:48,705 --> 01:42:53,042
- Well, Bill...?
- Sure.

1033
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:58,339
It's funny you should
ask that question, Bill...

1034
01:42:58,590 --> 01:43:01,925
...because there was something
a little strange...

1035
01:43:02,135 --> 01:43:04,636
...about the way Mr. Nightingale left.

1036
01:43:04,971 --> 01:43:07,348
Really? What was that?

1037
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:09,725
Well...

1038
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:20,069
He came in this morning,
about 4:30 a. m...

1039
01:43:20,653 --> 01:43:22,571
...with two men.

1040
01:43:23,573 --> 01:43:25,282
Big guys.

1041
01:43:25,825 --> 01:43:28,786
They were very well-dressed
and very well-spoken.

1042
01:43:28,995 --> 01:43:32,664
But they weren't the kind of people
you'd fool around with...

1043
01:43:32,957 --> 01:43:34,666
...if you know what I mean.

1044
01:43:37,462 --> 01:43:38,962
Anyways...

1045
01:43:40,256 --> 01:43:45,010
...I noticed Mr. Nightingale
had a bruise on his cheek.

1046
01:43:45,762 --> 01:43:50,682
To be perfectly honest, I also
thought he looked a little scared.

1047
01:43:51,684 --> 01:43:52,851
Scared?

1048
01:43:53,144 --> 01:43:54,728
Yes. Yes.

1049
01:43:55,605 --> 01:43:57,231
He said he wanted to check out.

1050
01:43:57,482 --> 01:44:01,360
And then he went upstairs to his room
with one of the men.

1051
01:44:01,653 --> 01:44:05,531
The other guy stayed down in the lobby
and settled his bill.

1052
01:44:06,282 --> 01:44:10,494
When they came back, Mr. Nightingale
tried to pass me an envelope.

1053
01:44:10,662 --> 01:44:12,371
But they saw it and took it...

1054
01:44:12,622 --> 01:44:15,499
...and said that any mail
or messages for him...

1055
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:20,295
...would be collected by someone
properly authorized to do so.

1056
01:44:21,131 --> 01:44:23,632
And then they just
took him off in a car.

1057
01:44:24,926 --> 01:44:27,261
Do you have any idea where they went?

1058
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:29,555
No, not a clue.

1059
01:44:34,644 --> 01:44:35,769
Well...

1060
01:44:38,022 --> 01:44:39,273
Anyway...

1061
01:44:41,693 --> 01:44:43,861
I certainly appreciate your help.

1062
01:44:44,070 --> 01:44:45,696
Anytime, Bill.

1063
01:44:45,947 --> 01:44:46,947
CLERK:
Bye.

1064
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:24,359
MILICH:
Oh, the good doctor!

1065
01:45:24,569 --> 01:45:25,903
Mr. Milich.

1066
01:45:26,237 --> 01:45:31,200
- Was your outfit a success?
- Yes, it was. Thank you.

1067
01:45:31,743 --> 01:45:33,076
Good, good.

1068
01:45:33,244 --> 01:45:38,248
Tuxedo. Cloak. Shoes.

1069
01:45:40,835 --> 01:45:44,588
I think you forgot the mask.

1070
01:45:45,882 --> 01:45:47,382
It's not there?

1071
01:45:48,343 --> 01:45:50,886
Maybe you left it at the party?

1072
01:45:55,934 --> 01:45:57,518
I don't think so.

1073
01:45:59,479 --> 01:46:03,023
I must have lost it.
Could you put it on the bill, please?

1074
01:46:03,233 --> 01:46:04,233
Sure.

1075
01:46:08,530 --> 01:46:10,405
Here we are.

1076
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:16,036
That was 150 for the rental,
200 you said for my trouble...

1077
01:46:16,246 --> 01:46:19,706
...25 for the mask. Sorry...

1078
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:24,127
Three hundred seventy-five.

1079
01:46:26,756 --> 01:46:28,048
Yes, dear?

1080
01:46:28,383 --> 01:46:29,841
Come, come.

1081
01:46:31,135 --> 01:46:34,054
Would you like to say hello
to Dr. Harford?

1082
01:46:35,306 --> 01:46:37,808
- Hello.
- Hello.

1083
01:46:43,356 --> 01:46:46,191
Thank you, Mr. Milich.
I'll call you soon.

1084
01:46:47,151 --> 01:46:49,027
Goodbye, gentlemen.

1085
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:52,573
- Merry Christmas and happy New Year!
MAN: And you too.

1086
01:46:53,533 --> 01:46:55,784
MILICH:
Well, Dr. Harford...

1087
01:46:57,036 --> 01:46:58,662
...here is your receipt.

1088
01:46:59,956 --> 01:47:02,207
I'm tearing up your deposits...

1089
01:47:03,376 --> 01:47:05,711
...and thanks for the business.

1090
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:13,594
Mr. Milich, last night...

1091
01:47:16,389 --> 01:47:18,807
...you were going to call the police.

1092
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:20,100
Well...

1093
01:47:20,351 --> 01:47:24,438
Things change.
We have come to another arrangement.

1094
01:47:24,689 --> 01:47:29,610
And by the way, if the good doctor
should ever want anything again...

1095
01:47:30,236 --> 01:47:31,987
...anything at all...

1096
01:47:32,989 --> 01:47:35,532
...it needn't be a costume.

1097
01:47:57,639 --> 01:47:58,972
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

1098
01:48:03,019 --> 01:48:04,269
Come in.

1099
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:08,732
- Tuna salad and black coffee.
BILL: Thanks.

1100
01:48:09,776 --> 01:48:12,819
Listen, how's my afternoon looking?

1101
01:48:13,029 --> 01:48:17,991
I think it's just Mrs. Akerly at 2:30
and Mrs. Kominski at 4.

1102
01:48:18,368 --> 01:48:22,579
Well, something's come up, and I'm
not going to be able to see them.

1103
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:26,500
Please ask Dr. Miller if he can fit
them in. Otherwise, just apologize...

1104
01:48:26,751 --> 01:48:28,627
- ... and make new appointments.
- Sure.

1105
01:48:29,087 --> 01:48:33,173
And please call the garage and have
them get my car out in half an hour.

1106
01:48:33,383 --> 01:48:34,758
SECRETARY:
No problem.

1107
01:52:16,731 --> 01:52:17,814
ALICE:
Hi.

1108
01:52:18,065 --> 01:52:19,733
HELENA:
Hi, Daddy.

1109
01:52:20,735 --> 01:52:22,027
BILL:
Hi.

1110
01:52:24,488 --> 01:52:27,157
Any calls for me?

1111
01:52:27,366 --> 01:52:31,328
ALICE:
Dr. Sanders and Mrs. Shapiro.

1112
01:52:32,622 --> 01:52:35,081
- Hey, gang.
- Hi, Daddy.

1113
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,918
Look, I got all these right.

1114
01:52:38,127 --> 01:52:40,128
You got all of those right?

1115
01:52:40,671 --> 01:52:42,422
Every single one of them?

1116
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:44,090
That's good.

1117
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:45,884
You hungry?

1118
01:52:47,011 --> 01:52:48,303
Sort of.

1119
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:50,305
Want to eat at 7?

1120
01:52:50,514 --> 01:52:52,849
Seven? Listen, can we
make that earlier?

1121
01:52:53,059 --> 01:52:57,020
I have some appointments
at the office.

1122
01:52:57,229 --> 01:52:59,272
You have to go out again tonight?

1123
01:52:59,523 --> 01:53:00,523
I'm afraid so.

1124
01:53:00,691 --> 01:53:04,194
Daddy, am I gonna get
a puppy for Christmas?

1125
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:07,280
We'll see about that, okay?

1126
01:53:09,867 --> 01:53:11,952
HELENA:
He could be a watchdog...

1127
01:53:12,161 --> 01:53:13,662
We'll see.

1128
01:53:13,871 --> 01:53:16,623
ALICE:
Come on, baby, let's finish this off.

1129
01:53:16,874 --> 01:53:20,460
All right, we have Joe.
And Joe has $2.50.

1130
01:53:20,670 --> 01:53:25,298
And Mike has $1.75.

1131
01:53:25,549 --> 01:53:29,177
Joe has how much more money than Mike?

1132
01:53:29,387 --> 01:53:31,721
HELENA:
$0.75?

1133
01:53:33,641 --> 01:53:37,060
ALICE: So is it gonna be

1264
02:13:23,246 --> 02:13:26,665
...have the wrong idea
about one or two things.

What in the hell
are you talking about?

1267
02:13:49,772 --> 02:13:52,441
Please, Bill, no games.

1268
02:13:54,611 --> 02:13:56,069
I was there.

What the hell did you think
you were doing?

1273
02:14:25,808 --> 02:14:29,102
I couldn't even begin to imagine...

1274

...how you'd heard about it...

1275

...let alone got yourself
through the door.

1276
02:14:39,614 --> 02:14:44,576
Then I remembered seeing you
with that prick piano player...

1277
02:14:44,827 --> 02:14:48,038
...Nick whatever the fuck his name was,
at my party.

1278
02:14:48,998 --> 02:14:52,000
And it didn't take much to
figure out the rest.

1279
02:14:56,464 --> 02:14:58,340
It wasn't Nick's fault.

1280
02:15:00,093 --> 02:15:01,635
It was mine.

1281
02:15:02,095 --> 02:15:04,096
Of course it was Nick's fault.

1282
02:15:04,472 --> 02:15:07,975
If he hadn't mentioned it to you,
none of this would've happened.

1283
02:15:08,184 --> 02:15:10,894
I recommended that cocksucker
to those people...

1284
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:14,064
...and he's made me look like
a complete asshole.

1285
02:15:18,861 --> 02:15:20,362
Victor?

1286
02:15:21,739 --> 02:15:23,657
What can I say?

1287
02:15:29,998 --> 02:15:31,373
I had...

1288
02:15:32,875 --> 02:15:34,418
...absolutely...

1289
02:15:35,378 --> 02:15:40,007
...no idea you were involved
in any way.

1290
02:15:41,426 --> 02:15:43,510
I know you didn't, Bill.

1291
02:15:45,430 --> 02:15:47,472
But I also know that you...

1292
02:15:48,474 --> 02:15:51,059
You went to Nick's hotel
this morning...

1293
02:15:51,311 --> 02:15:53,061
...and talked to the desk clerk.

1294

How do you know that?

1295
02:15:58,276 --> 02:16:00,319
Because I had you followed.

1296
02:16:06,242 --> 02:16:07,951
You had me followed?

1297
02:16:10,330 --> 02:16:12,664
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1298
02:16:13,041 --> 02:16:14,958
All right? I owe you an apology.

1299
02:16:15,168 --> 02:16:17,919
This was for your own good, believe me.

1300
02:16:18,296 --> 02:16:22,299
I know what the desk clerk told you.
But what he didn't tell you is...

1301
02:16:22,550 --> 02:16:25,761
...all they did was
put Nick on a plane to Seattle.

1302
02:16:26,137 --> 02:16:29,931
By now he's probably back
with his family...

1303
02:16:30,475 --> 02:16:32,434
...banging Mrs. Nick.

1304
02:16:33,728 --> 02:16:36,980
The clerk said
he had a bruise on his face.

1305
02:16:39,067 --> 02:16:42,235
Okay, he had a bruise on his face.

1306
02:16:43,321 --> 02:16:46,281
That's a hell of a lot less
than he deserves.

1307
02:16:47,116 --> 02:16:51,244
I don't think you realize what
kind of trouble you were in last night.

1308
02:16:52,663 --> 02:16:54,790
Who do you think those people were?

1309
02:16:55,458 --> 02:16:57,584
Those were not just
ordinary people there.

1310
02:16:57,794 --> 02:17:01,129
If I told you their names-
I'm not gonna tell you their names...

1311
02:17:01,339 --> 02:17:05,092
...but if I did,
I don't think you'd sleep so well.

1312
02:17:08,721 --> 02:17:10,847
Was it the second password?

1313
02:17:12,225 --> 02:17:13,975
Is that what gave me away?

1314
02:17:16,104 --> 02:17:18,355
Yes, finally.

1315
02:17:20,483 --> 02:17:22,776
But not because you didn't know it.

1316
02:17:24,695 --> 02:17:27,614
It's because there was
no second password.

1317
02:17:28,825 --> 02:17:33,328
Of course it didn't help a whole lot
that those people arrive in limos...

1318
02:17:33,538 --> 02:17:36,039
...and you showed up in a taxi.

1319
02:17:36,290 --> 02:17:40,001
Or that they found the receipt from
the rental house in your coat...

1320
02:17:40,211 --> 02:17:43,338
...made out to you-know-who.

1321
02:17:52,723 --> 02:17:54,349
There was a...

1322
02:17:58,396 --> 02:18:00,105
There was a...

1323
02:18:01,065 --> 02:18:04,526
There was a woman there...

1324
02:18:10,324 --> 02:18:12,117
...who tried to warn me.

1325
02:18:17,790 --> 02:18:19,040
I know.

1326
02:18:24,797 --> 02:18:26,548
Do you know who she was?

1327
02:18:31,888 --> 02:18:33,054
Yes.

1328
02:18:40,563 --> 02:18:42,272
She was a hooker.

1329
02:18:51,824 --> 02:18:53,492
Sorry, but...

1330
02:18:54,660 --> 02:18:56,661
...that's what she was.

1331
02:19:01,083 --> 02:19:02,250
A hooker.

1332
02:19:11,886 --> 02:19:13,094
Bill...

1333
02:19:17,099 --> 02:19:19,601
Suppose I told you...

1334
02:19:21,229 --> 02:19:24,147
...that everything that
happened to you there...

1335
02:19:25,650 --> 02:19:29,778
...the threats, the girl's warnings...

1336
02:19:29,987 --> 02:19:32,739
...her last-minute intervention...

1337
02:19:32,949 --> 02:19:36,743
...suppose I said that all of that...

1338
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:40,789
...was staged.

1339
02:19:42,917 --> 02:19:46,795
That it was a kind of charade.

1340
02:19:48,381 --> 02:19:50,340
That it was fake.

1341
02:19:54,929 --> 02:19:56,304
Fake?

1342
02:19:58,057 --> 02:20:00,642
Yes. Fake.

1343
02:20:12,154 --> 02:20:14,072
Why would they do that?

1344
02:20:14,907 --> 02:20:16,157
VICTOR:
Why?

1345
02:20:17,451 --> 02:20:19,160
In plain words...

1346
02:20:20,037 --> 02:20:22,581
...to scare the living shit out of you.

1347
02:20:23,749 --> 02:20:27,168
To keep you quiet
about where you'd been...

1348
02:20:27,670 --> 02:20:29,379
...and what you'd seen.

1349
02:20:49,483 --> 02:20:51,067
Have you seen this?

1350
02:21:08,419 --> 02:21:10,420
Yes, I have.

1351
02:21:15,885 --> 02:21:19,012
I saw her body in the morgue.

1352
02:21:23,517 --> 02:21:24,976
Was she...

1353
02:21:27,813 --> 02:21:31,024
Was she the woman at the party?

1354
02:21:38,866 --> 02:21:40,116
VICTOR:
Yes.

1355
02:21:43,329 --> 02:21:44,788
She was.

1356
02:21:55,633 --> 02:21:56,966
Victor...

1357
02:21:59,053 --> 02:22:01,638
The woman lying dead in the morgue...

1358
02:22:03,641 --> 02:22:05,517
...was the woman at the party.

1359
02:22:07,937 --> 02:22:09,104
Yes.

1360
02:22:14,193 --> 02:22:19,072
Well, Victor, maybe I'm
missing something here.

1361
02:22:19,949 --> 02:22:23,451
You called it a fake, a charade.

1362
02:22:25,079 --> 02:22:28,456
Do you mind telling me
what kind of fucking charade...

1363
02:22:28,708 --> 02:22:32,544
...ends with somebody turning up dead?

1364
02:22:38,467 --> 02:22:43,096
Okay, Bill, let's cut the bullshit.
All right?

1365
02:22:43,305 --> 02:22:46,099
You've been way out of your depth
for the last 24 hours.

1366
02:22:46,350 --> 02:22:49,811
You want to know what kind of charade?
I'll tell you exactly what kind.

1367
02:22:51,063 --> 02:22:54,733
That whole play-acted,
"take me" phony sacrifice...

1368
02:22:54,942 --> 02:22:59,529
...that you've been jerking off with
had nothing to do with her real death.

1369
02:22:59,739 --> 02:23:03,366
Nothing happened after you left
that hadn't happened to her before.

1370
02:23:03,576 --> 02:23:06,619
She got her brains fucked out. Period.

1371
02:23:08,038 --> 02:23:12,459
When they took her home,
she was just fine...

1372
02:23:13,085 --> 02:23:14,836
...and the rest is in the paper.

1373
02:23:15,004 --> 02:23:18,715
She was a junkie. She OD'd.
There was nothing suspicious.

1374
02:23:18,924 --> 02:23:23,136
Her door was locked from the inside.
The police are happy. End of story.

1375
02:23:24,513 --> 02:23:29,476
Come on. It was always gonna be
just a matter of time with her.

1376
02:23:29,852 --> 02:23:31,478
Remember, you told her so yourself.

1377
02:23:31,687 --> 02:23:35,565
You remember, the one with the
great tits who OD'd in my bathroom?

1378
02:23:52,458 --> 02:23:56,586
Listen, Bill, nobody killed anybody.

1379
02:23:57,004 --> 02:23:59,672
Someone died. It happens all the time.

1380
02:24:01,133 --> 02:24:03,468
But life goes on.

1381
02:24:03,886 --> 02:24:05,303
It always does...

1382
02:24:05,554 --> 02:24:07,013
...until it doesn't.

1383
02:24:08,641 --> 02:24:10,517
But you know that, don't you?

1384
02:27:35,180 --> 02:27:37,682
I'll tell you everything.

1385
02:27:43,105 --> 02:27:45,398
I'll tell you everything.

1386
02:28:37,242 --> 02:28:39,452
Helena's gonna be up soon.

1387
02:28:56,345 --> 02:29:00,681
She's expecting us to
take her Christmas shopping today.

1388
02:29:25,415 --> 02:29:26,499
That's nice.

1389
02:29:26,750 --> 02:29:29,335
I could put Sabrina in here.

1390
02:29:30,087 --> 02:29:32,505
It's really pretty.

1391
02:29:32,714 --> 02:29:34,715
It's old-fashioned.

1392
02:29:43,851 --> 02:29:45,101
He's big.

1393
02:29:45,310 --> 02:29:48,729
I hope Santa Claus gets me
one of these for Christmas.

1394
02:29:48,939 --> 02:29:50,231
You do?

1395
02:29:52,526 --> 02:29:54,735
Well, you're gonna
have to wait and see.

1396
02:30:00,742 --> 02:30:01,868
Alice?

1397
02:30:08,876 --> 02:30:10,918
What do you think we should do?

1398
02:30:16,091 --> 02:30:17,550
What do I think we should do?

1399
02:30:17,801 --> 02:30:19,093
HELENA:
Look, Mommy!

1400
02:30:28,437 --> 02:30:31,105
What do I think?
I don't know.

1401
02:30:33,275 --> 02:30:35,067
I mean, maybe...

1402
02:30:47,080 --> 02:30:50,583
Maybe I think...

1403
02:30:51,293 --> 02:30:53,628
...we should be grateful.

1404
02:30:59,635 --> 02:31:01,219
Grateful...

1405
02:31:01,803 --> 02:31:06,807
...that we've managed to
survive through all of our...

1406
02:31:07,643 --> 02:31:09,352
...adventures...

1407
02:31:11,813 --> 02:31:14,148
...whether they were real...

1408
02:31:14,650 --> 02:31:16,901
...or only a dream.

1409
02:31:26,161 --> 02:31:29,997
Are you sure of that?

1410
02:31:33,919 --> 02:31:35,544
Am I sure?

1411
02:31:51,353 --> 02:31:53,104
Only as sure as I am...

1412
02:31:53,355 --> 02:31:57,191
...that the reality of one night...

1413
02:31:58,485 --> 02:32:01,362
...let alone that of a whole lifetime...

1414
02:32:03,865 --> 02:32:06,284
...can ever be the whole truth.

1415
02:32:13,041 --> 02:32:15,042
And no dream is ever...

1416
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:18,713
...just a dream.

1417
02:32:27,180 --> 02:32:29,265
The important thing is...

1418
02:32:31,143 --> 02:32:32,893
...we're awake now...

1419
02:32:34,187 --> 02:32:36,522
...and hopefully...

1420
02:32:39,568 --> 02:32:41,777
...for a long time to come.

1421
02:32:45,449 --> 02:32:46,949
Forever.

1422
02:32:49,119 --> 02:32:50,578
Forever?

1423
02:32:52,914 --> 02:32:54,415
Forever.

1424
02:32:56,793 --> 02:33:00,421
Let's not use that word. You know?

1425
02:33:01,757 --> 02:33:03,716
It frightens me.

1426
02:33:13,977 --> 02:33:17,104
But I do love you...

1427
02:33:20,233 --> 02:33:21,942
...and you know...

1428
02:33:23,070 --> 02:33:25,237
...there is something very important...

1429
02:33:25,489 --> 02:33:28,199
...that we need
to do as soon as possible.

1430
02:33:29,534 --> 02:33:30,826
What's that?

1431
02:33:33,997 --> 02:33:35,456
Fuck.
