1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,420
Palermo...

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,790
this is war.

3
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:13,631
Act accordingly.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,580
Doors!

5
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:22,956
Fire!

6
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,463
Everything can go to shit
in a split second.

7
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,578
The moment you feel
death creeping in,

8
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:10,245
you know nothing will ever be the same...

9
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:15,576
and that you need to try your best
to survive.

10
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,710
Nairobi, hang in there!

11
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:24,576
Hang in there. Hang in there, Nairobi.

12
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,206
Come on.

13
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:28,788
Let's go!

14
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:32,631
We all have snipers aiming at our hearts.

15
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:36,171
But the true terror arrives

16
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,170
when that bullet doesn't hit you...
but takes out someone you love.

17
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,080
Hurry up!

18
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,248
Saline, Rio.

19
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Almost done.

20
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,665
The Professor was feeling
that terror the most.

21
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:14,498
Two words that should never go together
collided in his heart, love and death.

22
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,251
That made him freeze up.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,960
As he ran through the woods...

24
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,126
he couldn't stop thinking,

25
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,375
They've killed the woman I love.

26
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,671
But Lisbon was there.

27
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,285
She wasn't gone.

28
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,630
The shots of her fake execution
had sounded real enough to the Professor.

29
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,668
Our mastermind was losing his head
like never before.

30
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,583
And along with him,

31
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,286
we were losing ours.

32
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,375
Pulse 155 and rising.

33
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,748
Blood pressure 85/40. It's dropping.

34
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:29,293
- We need two units of blood and saline.
- Nairobi.

35
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,955
Stay strong. I'm here.

36
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,958
In the tent, Tamayo felt what I felt.

37
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,245
We were staring death in the face.

38
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,921
A dry mouth. The taste of metal.

39
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,291
Tightness in the chest
and pain in the temples.

40
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:59,206
But until it was game over,
we still had everything to play for.

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,500
Blood at 30°C, ready for transfusion.

42
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:27,785
It's here.

43
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,205
The bullet. Behind the seventh rib.

44
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,461
It's in the lower part of the lung.

45
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,956
That's good news, honey.

46
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,458
She can't breathe. It's a collapsed lung.

47
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:45,211
- We have to release air.
- Tokyo, surgical kit six.

48
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,751
OK, surgical kit six.

49
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,293
There's air between the lung
and chest wall.

50
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,455
Hurry, Helsinki.

51
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,133
- She can't breathe!
- Hurry up!

52
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,418
There we go.

53
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,171
Get me out of here.

54
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,461
I'd rather be in prison alive.
I don't want to die.

55
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,580
Tokyo...

56
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,920
hand me over to the police, please.

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,290
Please.

58
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,825
Hand me over.

59
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,503
STAGE 3

60
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,463
RESISTANCE

61
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:57,326
Once they hand over Rio,
we'll begin stage three of the plan.

62
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,245
Resistance.

63
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,286
You can't get out
of the Bank of Spain alive.

64
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,210
It's impossible.

65
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,996
But I will get you out of there.

66
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,923
Once we begin stage three,

67
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,880
there'll only be one countdown,
the gold.

68
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,458
And our only goal will be to melt it.

69
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,916
Because the gold is the key.

70
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,923
Without it,
I won't be able to get you out.

71
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,495
The police...

72
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,380
will react harshly, but it doesn't matter.

73
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,828
Whatever happens,

74
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,126
whatever they do...

75
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,921
we need to be able to keep control.

76
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,326
Otherwise, our lives will be in danger.

77
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,206
Did we kill any officers?

78
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,126
I don't know, but they were on fire.

79
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:11,828
They'll come back all guns blazing.
We can't defend ourselves.

80
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,080
And Nairobi needs a surgeon.

81
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,083
We used an antitank gun.
They won't send one.

82
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,376
She's got a bullet in her lung.

83
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,748
We can't do it ourselves.
You've got to try.

84
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,831
We need the Pakistani surgeon.

85
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,166
- How much time do I have?
- She's dying.

86
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,581
He has crampons, dog deterrent,
and camouflage clothes.

87
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:41,631
He may be hiding among the branches.
Shoot up into the treetops.

88
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,415
Raquel, don't let them get you alone.
Tell them I'll surrender.

89
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,500
Raquel!

90
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,746
Get out of there!

91
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,628
Get out of there!

92
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,785
Get out of there!

93
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,416
I'm going to try.

94
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,960
Easy.

95
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,625
Easy.

96
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,076
Good little bull.

97
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,495
Easy.

98
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,706
Easy.

99
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:09,923
Eas...

100
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:26,211
The Professor is attacking the police,
but nobody is leaving the Bank of Spain.

101
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,961
Demonstrators are in a state of shock.

102
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,171
Will this affect public support
for the Dalís?

103
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,380
For the moment, nobody can say.

104
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:38,458
But we may be witnessing
the Professor's first big problem.

105
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,791
That was unreal,
the best we could hope for.

106
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,745
Those men have
second- and third-degree burns.

107
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,833
As expected.

108
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:49,206
- We need another armored van.
- Don't you care about anything?

109
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,253
I won't send more men
to be permanently disfigured!

110
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,043
They fired rockets at us,
and everyone in Spain saw it.

111
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,535
I'm not starting a war
in the center of Madrid.

112
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,825
It's already started.

113
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,580
Tamayo.

114
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,631
Don't make
the biggest mistake of your life.

115
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,248
My mistake was sending you
to torture that kid.

116
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,785
If we'd taken him to court,
we wouldn't be here.

117
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,745
We gave them strength and ammunition.
I won't do it again.

118
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:24,923
You're scared.

119
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,673
You're like Prieto.

120
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,753
You've got pills on your nightstand
and erectile dysfunction.

121
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,130
And you think the law will save you.

122
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,790
The law can't help us now.

123
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,165
I am the law.

124
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,960
And erectile dysfunction, my ass!

125
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:50,876
Maintain composure.

126
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:58,328
Let's de-escalate the situation, OK?
Dialogue and truce. Truce and dialogue.

127
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,285
Is that clear?

128
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,041
Crystal clear, boss.

129
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,963
Antoñanzas.

130
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,630
Yes, Inspector?

131
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:17,498
You heard that, right?
He is the law, like John Wayne.

132
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,420
I want an ambulance and a surgeon.

133
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,291
Now!

134
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,461
Let's get them
to hand over their wounded.

135
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,788
The governor studied medicine in the army.
He's going to help us.

136
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:44,535
I didn't complete the course
or practice, obviously, but...

137
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,461
I still know a few things.

138
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,916
- Put on some scrubs.
- I'll go get them.

139
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,791
Where's the damn surgeon?

140
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,825
I'm trying to reach him,
but they have to give me access.

141
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,246
Bogotá, anesthetic.

142
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:59,793
- Nairobi, we're going to put you under.
- You're not putting me under. Tokyo.

143
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,173
Tokyo...

144
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,458
tell him it's my life...

145
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,333
and I decide.

146
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,578
That's exactly why
we're going to operate on you here.

147
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,916
Tokyo, please.

148
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,791
Please.

149
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,381
She decides.

150
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,378
Period.

151
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,001
Helsinki, put her under.
That's a fucking order.

152
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,536
You don't give me orders.
You're not my boss, asshole.

153
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,575
You let the phone in.

154
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,165
You're supposed to protect us.

155
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,916
She can make mistakes, but you can't!

156
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,670
Shut up, big man,
or I'll fucking kill you!

157
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,750
Shut the fuck up.

158
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,423
You're my little whore, not my mom.

159
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,500
It's her fault she's in this state.
She's an idiot.

160
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,788
If she says she's leaving,
I'll walk her to the door.

161
00:13:56,833 --> 00:14:00,213
And you'll keep your mouth shut,
you piece of shit,

162
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,171
because from now on,
you're no longer my boss.

163
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,745
Put the gun down.

164
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,673
Denver.

165
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,750
If she talks, they'll kill us all.
We're treating her in here.

166
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,285
How are you going to treat her, dumbass?

167
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,125
Nairobi needs a surgeon.

168
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,080
Have you all gone nuts or what?

169
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,633
I swear on my son's life...
I won't tell them anything.

170
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:27,078
You think you won't,
but when they torture you, things change.

171
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,918
I don't give a shit!

172
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,000
She's leaving.

173
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:34,666
I don't think so.

174
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,331
Do you think
this is a good time for a rebellion?

175
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,376
One of the gang is dying.
Stop fucking around!

176
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,213
- Another one of the gang.
- What do you mean, another one?

177
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,288
They killed Lisbon half an hour ago.

178
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,833
I could show you my democratic side.

179
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:08,126
We could vote and send her out,
but I'd be killing her.

180
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,708
Lisbon was killed
on her knees and unarmed.

181
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,331
They brought Nairobi's son

182
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,416
with a teddy bear
to shoot her in the head.

183
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,290
Do you think the Red Cross is outside?
You've got to be fucking kidding!

184
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,326
Palermo is right.

185
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,288
You'll have to open me up...

186
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,078
and remove the bullet.

187
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:38,786
Maybe...

188
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,710
remove part of my lung.

189
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,830
All that,
without me bleeding to death.

190
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,543
You're going to kill me.

191
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,461
You're going to kill me.

192
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,246
Helsinki.

193
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,581
It's too complicated.

194
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,791
It's too complicated for you guys.

195
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,710
Take me to the door.

196
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,501
- Take me to the door.
- Relax.

197
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,133
- Take me to the door.
- Calm down.

198
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,625
- Calm down.
- Take me to the door.

199
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,668
- I'm going.
- What are you doing?

200
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,830
I'm going.

201
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,376
No!

202
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,918
No!

203
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,626
No...

204
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,538
No!

205
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,916
No...

206
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:48,288
Sorry, Professor. We had an argument.

207
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,463
I was going to sleep in Tokyo's room.

208
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,630
Are you sure you don't mind me sleeping
here with you?

209
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,333
It's all right.

210
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,173
But having someone in my bed
turns me on.

211
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,290
Do you mind?

212
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,080
Mind what?

213
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,536
Releasing some stress.

214
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,043
Rubbing our lamps.

215
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,001
I knew you were joking.

216
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:39,708
Can someone please tell me
why Palermo is in charge of the heist?

217
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,501
Because it was his idea.

218
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,291
- He's the mastermind.
- Mastermind?

219
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:49,496
The guy who was grabbing his junk
in the hallway like an ape?

220
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,133
Come on! Are you serious?

221
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,631
You know who should be in charge?

222
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,581
You. Yes, you.

223
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,830
I agree. If anyone has a lot invested
in this going well, it's you.

224
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:10,076
Don't egg me on.

225
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:11,958
I'm going to sleep.

226
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,456
Good night.

227
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:26,041
I'm going to talk with the Professor.
You'll see.

228
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:35,456
Professor, I want to be in charge...
of the heist. I'm better than Palermo.

229
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,461
Can we talk about it tomorrow...

230
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,421
No, not tomorrow, now.

231
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,165
- Why's he in charge?
- Let's see.

232
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:47,420
He is in charge because this heist
has been in development for a long time.

233
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,790
He's been involved since the start.
The plan's in his head.

234
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:51,705
And?

235
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:57,785
I can learn it. I'm a quick learner.
Platero's a small, soft, hairy donkey,

236
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,535
so soft you could say he's all cotton,
no bones.

237
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:07,456
- Platero and I. By Juan Ramón Jiménez.
- We know.

238
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:11,748
I don't know if you realize,
but you're spoiling an intimate moment.

239
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,418
What is it?

240
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:21,916
Are you horny?

241
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,630
I was. Yes, I was.

242
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,078
Oh, were you?

243
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,418
I can't really imagine you two at it.

244
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,000
You'd be quite surprised.

245
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,253
Please...

246
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,633
Wow, really?

247
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,708
Want me to stay?

248
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:39,746
No.

249
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,753
What about you?

250
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,753
Why are we talking about this?

251
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,043
Because I'm proposing a threesome.

252
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,923
Palermo, you, and me.

253
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,170
He can do the numbers and calculations,
you can do the strategy.

254
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,040
But I'm the best captain
you could have in there.

255
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,791
Because when the going gets tough,
I react.

256
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,833
That's not something you can study.
You're born with it.

257
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,826
Ladies and gentlemen...
I'm taking command.

258
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,081
Let's operate.

259
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:26,251
She's taking charge, the mastermind,
the intelligent, level-headed one.

260
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:30,633
The crazy bitch who brought us here
and cost some of us our lives. Great.

261
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,128
I'll leave you all playing doctors.

262
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,791
I'm going to think about my next move.
Careful.

263
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,958
It was our darkest half hour.

264
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,331
In 30 minutes,

265
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,455
the police had come back
with guns blazing,

266
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,671
and they had us on the ropes.

267
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:04,668
The Professor, under the trough,
was only thinking of those 30 minutes.

268
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,580
If he could've called
half an hour earlier,

269
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,791
Lisbon would be alive.

270
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,921
- Launch stage two of Hamelin.
- All right.

271
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,500
PRIVATE NUMBER

272
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,250
Alicia, empathy, dialogue, and truce.

273
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,211
Professor.

274
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,331
Five minutes as a widower,
and you're calling other women.

275
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,083
Naughty boy. You're a ladies' man.

276
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:13,416
- Did you order her execution?
- I didn't have time. She did it herself.

277
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,883
Murillo violently resisted arrest,

278
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:20,078
opening fire on her former colleagues,
like a traitor.

279
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:21,423
Colonel.

280
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,253
The cell tower isn't in Madrid.

281
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:35,626
It's a national highway.

282
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,206
In Huelva.

283
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,576
He's gotten through the cordon.

284
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:48,286
That bastard's on the move.
42 kilometers from your position.

285
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,325
You sure? It may be another trap.

286
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:53,376
I'm sure.
The signal bounced off three cell towers.

287
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:56,418
Highway 435, northbound. Go get him.

288
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,330
OK.

289
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,496
Inspector Rubio to all units.
We're leaving.

290
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:05,213
The target is escaping
on highway 435, northbound.

291
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,538
Listen, Sierra.

292
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,250
Before we're out of the Bank of Spain,

293
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,830
we'll destroy you.

294
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:24,666
So boring.

295
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,791
You're not an ethics professor, right?

296
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,826
No, you fired two rockets
in the center of Madrid,

297
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,996
and now you're on Al-Qaeda's team.

298
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,753
Bada bing, bada boom.

299
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:40,043
I'll fix my mistakes. I'm offering you
the chance to do the same with yours.

300
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:43,958
- Nairobi...
- No way! I won't send a surgeon in.

301
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:48,628
But I can offer access to medical care.
Bring Nairobi out.

302
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:50,918
I've got an ambulance waiting.

303
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,880
I won't put her in the hands
of a torturer who tried to kill her.

304
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:59,421
- Face the consequences.
- I'm trembling with fear.

305
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:05,713
As a gesture of goodwill,
I'm offering you a truce.

306
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,171
For the next 48 hours.

307
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,880
That way, you can assess
how serious the wound is.

308
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,210
Or let her die there.

309
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:16,211
I accept the truce,
but let me tell you something.

310
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,671
Nairobi will survive...

311
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,456
with or without your help.

312
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:26,785
Good.

313
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,713
Let's catch that bastard.

314
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:28,253
And how will we get out of the epicenter?

315
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,043
Following the Hamelin plan.

316
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:36,785
Tell me more.

317
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:45,075
Marseille will play the pipe,
and all the rats will run after him.

318
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,040
We'll make them believe we've escaped.

319
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:53,878
Exactly.

320
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:59,828
We'll leave a false trail, but...
a believable one, backed up with evidence,

321
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:03,626
and they'll leave the place
where we're hiding.

322
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:08,128
Then, when the predators have gone,
we'll climb down the trees like monkeys.

323
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,580
Don't you think
it'll be the most beautiful reunion?

324
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,541
Why'd you call me Mr. Potato Head?

325
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:04,166
I don't know. Your gait.

326
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,670
My gait? What gait?

327
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,040
Because you're... sweet.

328
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,535
Are you calling me sweet or fat?

329
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:13,205
Don't answer.
I'd rather think I'm sweet.

330
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:16,956
You really messed things up
calling me that.

331
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:21,881
Word got around. Now Homicide,
Internal Affairs, and the court all know.

332
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:24,878
I didn't know about memes
until I saw the Mr. Potato Head ones.

333
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:26,628
I'm really sorry.

334
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:40,996
Aren't you going to ask me...
why I got involved in this?

335
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,076
No.

336
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,461
I know you did it for love.

337
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:56,916
When we get to Madrid,
they'll offer you a cooperation deal.

338
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,173
I know.

339
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:03,541
Armed robbery, breach of the peace,

340
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:06,325
assaulting an officer,
possession of weapons,

341
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:09,456
disclosure of secrets,
belonging to an armed group,

342
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:10,631
and abduction.

343
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:14,456
Abduction of the hostages
and of my own daughter.

344
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:21,133
So, no matter what deal they offer me,

345
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:25,251
even with the most
anti-establishment prosecutor,

346
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,583
I'll do at least 30 years.

347
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,288
So, I'm fucked,

348
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,420
Mr. Potato Head.

349
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,130
The instructions you give
must be clear and concise, OK?

350
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,168
How many blood units do we need?

351
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:46,876
Have three ready at room temperature.

352
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,631
How many are there?

353
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:53,246
- Three.
- OK, go and get more.

354
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,883
O negative and A negative.

355
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:58,378
Draw enough for three operations.
Ask if anyone's a doctor.

356
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,878
Bogotá, go downstairs.

357
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:02,498
It's our only way out of here.
Get melting.

358
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,003
Being in charge suits you well.

359
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,633
You lost the team's trust.

360
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:16,248
Do you know what your only way out
will be once I'm not here?

361
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:21,288
Walking out with your hands up, praying

362
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:25,375
that there are so many cameras outside
that they won't shoot you.

363
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:28,958
Messieurs... au revoir.

364
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:30,246
Bye.

365
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:36,578
Go ahead, Doctor.

366
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:42,035
A 15-centimeter incision
between the sixth and seventh ribs.

367
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:43,035
Scalpel.

368
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:50,418
This time, if anyone gets injured,
we'll be ready to save their life.

369
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:55,165
We'll learn the protocols
for the most common gunshot wound cases.

370
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,330
In the truck,
apart from what we need for the heist,

371
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:03,793
we'll also carry medical supplies
to carry out any kind of surgery.

372
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,830
Dr. Ahmed will be the brains,
but he'll be 7,000 km away.

373
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:10,166
You'll be the hands.

374
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,290
And it won't be easy.

375
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:15,001
You can't hesitate.

376
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:17,418
You can't fail.

377
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:21,206
Because it won't be
a dead pig on the table.

378
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,380
It'll be one of you.

379
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:31,918
- Suction. I can't see.
- Bring the camera closer.

380
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,420
Always keep the surgical area clean.

381
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,253
- I can see.
- Next step?

382
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:39,456
We need to separate the ribs.

383
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,250
You may have to remove part of the lung.

384
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,003
Separate the ribs? Fuck me.

385
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,665
The rib spreader.

386
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:56,333
- Is this it?
- Yes, bring it here.

387
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,920
Those with blood types O negative or
A negative, raise your hands.

388
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,330
Are you going to make us
check your medical records?

389
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:24,956
Paquita.
You were a nurse's aide, weren't you?

390
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,631
Yes, sir. And a midwife.

391
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:27,998
Come with me.

392
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:31,503
Everyone with their hand raised,
come with me now!

393
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:02,458
Hello.

394
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,210
Professor.

395
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:06,541
- Marseille!
- Yes, it's me. Don't worry.

396
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:12,826
- The cops aren't here.
- Where's the bull?

397
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:15,996
- What bull?
- Help me up. I'm stiff.

398
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,581
That bull?

399
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,580
That bull.

400
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,000
Start walking backwards
very slowly, Marseille,

401
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:37,168
and don't break eye contact.

402
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,708
Does this remind you of something?

403
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,041
San Fermín?

404
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:45,171
Italy.

405
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,830
When I met you, at the wedding.

406
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:49,626
Come on, farther back.

407
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:53,461
Isn't the bouquet thing for single women?

408
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:56,035
Do you see any single women here?

409
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,165
You're the closest thing we have.

410
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:01,205
Tradition says the bride has to throw it,

411
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:03,671
and that's what I'm doing.
Farther back.

412
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,880
Come on, move.

413
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,625
A welder, a gay guy,

414
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:09,878
a mute, and a librarian.

415
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:13,043
Fucking hell, this Italian wedding...

416
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,668
I'm not a mute. I'm just quiet.

417
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,960
I told you, I'm not a librarian.

418
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:20,131
Please just call me Sergio.

419
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:23,128
Ladies, the bride's throwing the bouquet.
Focus!

420
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:26,208
Come on, farther back, girls!
Just a bit more.

421
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:28,038
Farther back!

422
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:49,538
Ready?

423
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:56,628
My little brother!

424
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:59,498
- Bravissimo, little brother.
- Congratulations.

425
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:03,495
Mrs. Fonollosa,
it's time for the first dance.

426
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:07,043
- But first... a little surprise.
- What is it?

427
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:43,831
That's what I call a choir!

428
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:50,253
Like anyone with no sense of rhythm,

429
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,253
the Professor sat at the table.

430
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,923
There he wondered,

431
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:58,211
which carries more weight,
love or death?

432
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,496
Life carries the most weight.

433
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:02,543
Life.

434
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,830
Then there's me.
Dying but still getting married.

435
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:11,711
Isn't it a beautiful contradiction?

436
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:17,705
Does she know you're sick?

437
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:19,751
Of course she does.

438
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,630
She's very smart.

439
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:28,915
And if you look on the bright side,
we're lucky.

440
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,793
Most people don't know
when their time will come.

441
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,500
We get to stay
in the honeymoon period forever.

442
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:42,876
People buy a bottle of champagne
for a special occasion

443
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:44,458
and go back to their routines.

444
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:49,001
Tatiana and I will live life to the limit
with a barrel of French champagne.

445
00:36:57,125 --> 00:37:00,375
Death can be
the best opportunity of your life, Sergio.

446
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:20,293
Sad, Professor?

447
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,418
If you want,
you can talk to me about feelings.

448
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:29,995
Should I put some music on?

449
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:33,125
Music cheers you up.

450
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:45,878
The car's stolen. The music isn't mine.

451
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:48,628
It doesn't matter, Marseille.
Keep driving.

452
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:08,998
Excuse me.

453
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,706
Who is the blood for?

454
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,460
Why the fuck do you care?

455
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:18,501
Two of you went upstairs with the bear,
but only one of you is here.

456
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,793
Then you already know who it's for.

457
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:22,666
Now let's stay quiet.

458
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,580
- Denver.
- What?

459
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:35,996
Thank you.

460
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:40,711
- What for?
- I came in just to tell you in person.

461
00:38:42,916 --> 00:38:45,826
I know we didn't start off
on the right foot,

462
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:49,876
but what matters
is that you've raised my son.

463
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:52,998
- Thank you.
- What are you talking about, jerk?

464
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:59,706
That'll do, Paquita. Thank you.

465
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,920
At your age and with all that money...

466
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,960
changing diapers
probably wasn't part of your plan.

467
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:11,291
That does you credit.

468
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:13,325
Because it takes a real man

469
00:39:13,416 --> 00:39:17,576
to look after a kid who was born
from another man's sperm.

470
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:19,166
Look, freak.

471
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,630
Be quiet. Don't rile me up,

472
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,878
or you'll be eating my fist
till Christmas.

473
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:27,713
He isn't. He's not A negative.

474
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:29,291
Arturo is A positive.

475
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,750
What were you doing?

476
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,210
What were you doing?
I tested them by chance.

477
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:36,751
We could've killed her.

478
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:40,456
I'm sorry.

479
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:43,581
Sorry. Shit, I was wrong.
I didn't do it on purpose.

480
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:47,456
I know I'm A something. I didn't know
if it was positive or negative.

481
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:49,961
It's not something you use every day.
I'm sorry.

482
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:52,171
You're confused now, is that it?

483
00:39:56,791 --> 00:39:59,291
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

484
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:01,535
Maybe he really was confused.

485
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:06,883
- Help him, for Christ's sake!
- Get up. He's OK. Get up.

486
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:10,293
You can't go around
punching people like that.

487
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:15,165
- It's enough that they're trapped here.
- It's over. He's OK. I'm sorry.

488
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:18,415
It's OK.

489
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,423
Besides...

490
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:26,168
I know exactly why you're so pissed off.

491
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,460
- Why?
- I get it.

492
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:31,171
Mónica told you about the bathroom,
right?

493
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,330
What bathroom?

494
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:35,921
What bathroom is he talking about?

495
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I apologize.
For Christ's sake, I'm sorry.

496
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:41,253
I don't know what I was thinking.

497
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:44,753
I hadn't seen her or had her close
for such a long time...

498
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,883
I don't know, I misread the signs.

499
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:48,878
And she told me...

500
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:52,495
that we could meet somewhere
so I could see my kid.

501
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,333
One thing led to another,
and I went for it.

502
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:56,626
He went for what?

503
00:40:57,208 --> 00:41:00,038
- What did he go for?
- Denver, nothing happened.

504
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,455
Let it go.

505
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:06,788
Were you going to meet this jerk
to show him our son?

506
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:10,165
He confused me, saying he was his father.
He was upset...

507
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,500
OK, but... what did he go for?
I don't get it.

508
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:17,333
It wasn't her fault.
Leave her out of it. I'm the one to blame.

509
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:20,126
We hugged... I got aroused...

510
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:21,668
- I held her...
- Shut up!

511
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:23,576
Is that true?

512
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:30,333
Did this son of a bitch
rub himself against you with a hard-on?

513
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:33,626
I pushed him off right away with the gun.

514
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,170
Listen to me. I fought back, Denver.

515
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:39,416
So it's true.

516
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:47,746
Stop, Denver!

517
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,920
Stop, you're going to kill him,
Denver! Stop!

518
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:15,831
What the fuck is this?

519
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:21,076
What the fuck do you have inside of you?

520
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:23,293
All that rage...

521
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:27,576
All that violence...

522
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:30,376
You shot a hostage.

523
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,288
And now you beat him up...

524
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:35,996
like a maniac.

525
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,960
I can't...

526
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:44,498
I don't know what your trauma is
or where it came from,

527
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:46,423
but I can't, Denver.

528
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:51,075
I can't, and I don't want...

529
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,500
I don't want my son...

530
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:59,376
to feel that rage you carry inside.

531
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:02,458
I don't want that.

532
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,793
Correct. Continue.

533
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,326
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

534
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:34,331
- Is it him?
- The car rolled several times.

535
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:37,666
There are traces of blood and no driver.
It must be him.

536
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,750
Or a dealer, or someone undocumented...

537
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:42,173
The car was stolen just hours ago
in Salvatierra,

538
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,210
the town closest
to where we found Murillo.

539
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,038
And they climb trees.

540
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,080
I see.

541
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:51,793
Excuse me.

542
00:43:58,125 --> 00:43:59,875
- Yes, Colonel?
- Was it him?

543
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:03,788
I think so. He can't be far.
He's lost a lot of blood.

544
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:07,205
Let Suárez deal with it.
I need you here with Murillo.

545
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:10,131
Bring her to Madrid.
That's more important. OK?

546
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:12,498
- Understood.
- Get Suárez to send units

547
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,583
to all the hospitals in the area,

548
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:17,826
to every vet,
to every nun with a first aid kit.

549
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:23,250
I want everyone alert. If we lose him,
it'd better be because he's dead.

550
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,963
Pamuk.

551
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:36,955
What?

552
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,040
My dog was called Pamuk.

553
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:43,875
Pamuk was with me during the war.
I know how you feel.

554
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:49,208
Are you making some kind of metaphor
with your dead dog and my partner?

555
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:50,541
She was a female dog.

556
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:57,078
After the war, all my friends were dead.

557
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And I... spent my nights in a bar.

558
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,710
One day, another day...

559
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,920
Pamuk was always outside waiting.

560
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:14,286
Did you also fall in love
only to have her killed in front of you?

561
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:17,923
Yes.

562
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,210
What happened to Pamuk?

563
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:33,133
The boys from the village...
liked to play war.

564
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,630
After a while,

565
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:41,458
without an enemy,
they got bored of playing war.

566
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:45,578
One day... they found some stones.

567
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:49,458
They broke bottles.

568
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:55,125
And they said Pamuk was the enemy.

569
00:45:59,916 --> 00:46:00,826
I'm sorry.

570
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,920
She was a good dog.

571
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:17,075
Marseille, can you stop a minute?
I need to... urinate.

572
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,540
Good piss?

573
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:53,245
Peeing is a relief sometimes.

574
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:08,130
However great the pain,
we could not lose sight of one thing.

575
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,670
Our lives depended on what was happening
48 meters below the ground.

576
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:15,955
The plan had a very simple rule.

577
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,790
Either we got all the gold out of there,
or we were all dead.

578
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:25,920
No matter what was going on above,
we had to get the gold out.

579
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:29,996
No matter what was going on above,
we had to get the gold out.

580
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:37,415
Move the lung.
I want to see the lower part.

581
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,460
Okay.

582
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,540
Use your hand.

583
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:45,455
Colonel!

584
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:50,918
There's an increased flow
of electromagnetic signals

585
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,750
going in and out of the bank.

586
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:57,253
- Martínez, in layman's terms.
- They're communicating with the outside.

587
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:05,205
Move the image closer. OK.

588
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:08,536
OK, we need to remove
the lower part of the lung.

589
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:10,786
Risk of infection and necrosis.

590
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:11,995
It could kill her.

591
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:14,673
How are we gonna cut
part of her lung out?

592
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:17,081
- Do you have an electric scalpel?
- Yes.

593
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:20,786
- From its size, I'd say it's a video call.
- Can we watch it?

594
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:25,915
The signal is encrypted. I'd say
it's going through a Kazakh satellite...

595
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:31,503
then probably through the deep web.
It's impossible to be sure.

596
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:35,665
Let's take it down then.

597
00:49:38,166 --> 00:49:40,376
Let's do it. No time to waste.

598
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:43,168
Listen and follow my instructions closely.

599
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:47,075
- We'll go slowly. Understood?
- Understood.

600
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:51,416
Colonel... if it were
a Spanish phone company satellite,

601
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,170
- we'd request a jam...
- Don't tell me what we can't do.

602
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,420
I told you to cut off the damn call.

603
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,750
If you cut a vein, we stop the scalpel

604
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:04,003
- and close it with Kocher forceps.
- Understood.

605
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:06,633
We'd have to jam the signals in the area,

606
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:09,828
take down the internet
and anything using satellite.

607
00:50:09,916 --> 00:50:13,206
Like in Egypt in 2011. Do it.

608
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,580
Let's make the first incision.

609
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:18,826
- See the lingula?
- What's that?

610
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,416
Lower part...

611
00:50:22,875 --> 00:50:24,745
- What?
- You've gotta be kidding.

612
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:29,788
What's wrong?

613
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,750
- There's no return signal.
- What?

614
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:35,923
Fuck!

615
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:41,211
There's no signal. Everything is down.

616
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:43,083
What do we do?

617
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:45,956
Blood pressure is dropping.
We're losing her.

618
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:47,081
No.

619
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,630
No, fuck!
