Finding it and leaving with it
alive are two different things.

You saved the west turret.
That was extremely diplomatic.

When the drums call to battle,

505
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:31,160
the guards leave their posts and
take their positions on the Wall.

506

That is our moment.

507
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,250

00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,840

520
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,910
Where are the Tao Tei now?

521
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,460
STRATEGIST WANG:
The mountains, regrouping.

522
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,710
Where do they come from?

523
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,420
About 20 centuries ago,

524
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:29,340
there was an emperor whose greed brought
deep suffering to all of China.

525
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,720
The heavens sent the meteor
that struck Gouwu Mountain,

526
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,140
turning it green
and releasing the Tao Tei.

527
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,230
From that day on, the Tao
Tei rise every 60 years

528
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:43,150
to scourge the north of China.

529
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,940
They come to remind us of what
happens when greed is unchecked.

530
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,610
They eat anything,
alive or dead,

531
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,910
and take food to their queen.

532
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:58,290
She depends on her
soldiers to feed her.

533
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:03,170
Only with the food they provide
is she able to multiply.

534
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:10,510
The capital, and its two million
people, is only 800 li away.

535
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,350
If the Tao Tei ever had
that much nourishment,

536
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,810
no corner of the world
would be safe.
