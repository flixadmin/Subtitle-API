Because even though you lost her
at such a young age,

you didn't let your pain

Not lungs, heart.

it's all about the choices
we make.

You're gonna
make some good ones and,

you're gonna make some bad ones.

as long as you remember
to listen to your heart,

you're gonna
make the right choice

But the resemblance
is uncanny.

[song ends]

And done!

821
00:48:40,855 --> 00:48:43,457
Masterpiece.
Look at that.
Yay!

822
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:47,127
It's really been great
having time to ourselves.

823
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:49,831
Right. Absolutely.
I just feel so...

824
00:48:49,963 --> 00:48:51,265
relaxed, you know?
Clearheaded.

825
00:48:51,398 --> 00:48:53,868
Mmm, look at all these
new interests we found.

826
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:55,770
I know, so many hobbies.
So many!

827
00:48:55,904 --> 00:48:59,006
After the action and adventure
of the last few years,

828
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:01,543
well, I could get used to this.
Same.

829
00:49:01,676 --> 00:49:03,678
[deep rumbling]

830
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:09,383
[Sonic] Tom! Maddie!
We need your help on a super--

831
00:49:09,517 --> 00:49:12,620
Knuckles, do you mind?
Oh! Excuse me.

832
00:49:12,754 --> 00:49:14,087
Tom! Maddie! We need your help

833
00:49:14,221 --> 00:49:15,857
on a super-dangerous
top-secret mission!

834
00:49:16,023 --> 00:49:17,257
Hmm.

835
00:49:18,593 --> 00:49:20,327
Thank God. Yeah, we're in.
Let's go.

836
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:22,630
Really? You're in?
Just like that?

837
00:49:22,764 --> 00:49:25,800
Yes. It was getting so boring
without you guys here.
Yeah. So...

838
00:49:25,934 --> 00:49:27,434
No offense.
...boring. No, none taken.

839
00:49:27,569 --> 00:49:29,169
I mean, whatever crazy plan
you're cooking up,

840
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:30,538
the answer's yes.
Yes.

841
00:49:30,672 --> 00:49:33,875
Great. But first things first:
What is that?

842
00:49:34,007 --> 00:49:35,375
Oh! This is...

843
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,077
[in puppet voice]
...Li'l Tom!

844
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:38,813
[normal voice]
Isn't he great?

845
00:49:40,013 --> 00:49:42,416
I told you
to get rid of that.
It's very creepy.

846
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,918
[puppet voice]
I told him to get rid of you.

847
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:45,352
[normal voice]
Okay, that's, mmm...

848
00:49:45,486 --> 00:49:48,121
crossing a line there.
You are in so much trouble.

849
00:49:49,724 --> 00:49:52,760
Okay, this is it.
The belly of the beast.

850
00:49:52,894 --> 00:49:54,863
GUN Headquarters in London.

851
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:58,198
[gasps] Tom, we're finally gonna
get to see London together.

852
00:49:58,332 --> 00:50:00,300
Hey, I told you we'd
get there someday, baby.

853
00:50:00,434 --> 00:50:02,202
Okay. So here's the plan.

854
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:04,371
<i>I run in superfast,</i>

855
00:50:04,506 --> 00:50:06,708
<i>fly over that water,</i>
<i>no problem,</i>

856
00:50:06,841 --> 00:50:08,308
<i>and right when I get to the--</i>

857
00:50:09,376 --> 00:50:11,111
[shrieks]
What just happened?

858
00:50:11,245 --> 00:50:12,514
Congratulations.

859
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:14,649
You just got incinerated
by their energy shield.

860
00:50:14,782 --> 00:50:18,485
We'll need to shut it down
by planting a USB drive
in their server room

861
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:21,021
<i>that will give me full control</i>
<i>over it.</i>

862
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:22,624
That's what we need you two for.

863
00:50:22,757 --> 00:50:24,759
Couple of badass spies,
that's what we are.

864
00:50:24,893 --> 00:50:26,293
Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

865
00:50:26,426 --> 00:50:28,161
[Tails] <i>Once we</i>
<i>disable the shield,</i>

866
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:30,397
<i>you'll face the laser hall.</i>

867
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:31,766
[grunts]

868
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,570
<i>These high-density bad boys</i>
<i>will cut you into tiny pieces.</i>

869
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:39,339
<i>And cut those pieces</i>
<i>into even tinier pieces!</i>

870
00:50:39,473 --> 00:50:41,543
Once again... [shrieks]

871
00:50:41,676 --> 00:50:43,845
Can't we just get Tom Cruise
to do this?
[Tails] Nope.

872
00:50:43,978 --> 00:50:47,916
<i>Because not even he</i>
<i>could break into... the vault.</i>

873
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:49,383
[Sonic]
<i>Why is it empty in there?</i>

874
00:50:49,517 --> 00:50:50,852
[Tails]
<i>Because we have no idea</i>

875
00:50:50,985 --> 00:50:52,587
<i>what's on the other side</i>
<i>of that door.</i>

876
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,088
<i>To prevent the vault from ever</i>
<i>being accessed by a ring,</i>

877
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:58,425
<i>all images and schematics have</i>
<i>been wiped from GUN's database.</i>

878
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,828
So for the last leg
of this heist...

879
00:51:01,796 --> 00:51:04,231
[in puppet voice]
...we're going in blind.

880
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:09,704
Sorry.

881
00:51:09,837 --> 00:51:11,471
[Maddie] Okay,
I'm just gonna say it.

882
00:51:11,606 --> 00:51:13,908
It sounds like this plan would
work a heck of a lot better

883
00:51:14,042 --> 00:51:17,912
if Sonic used the Master Emerald
to go Golden God mode

884
00:51:18,046 --> 00:51:19,446
to get the key.

885
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,683
No way, Maddie.

886
00:51:21,816 --> 00:51:23,785
The Master Emerald
is too powerful
to ever use again.

887
00:51:23,918 --> 00:51:26,386
We made a promise to each other
to keep it hidden.

888
00:51:26,521 --> 00:51:28,856
In a location
only Knuckles knows.

889
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,925
As guardian
of the Master Emerald,

890
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:34,161
anyone who tries
to take it away
for any reason...

891
00:51:34,294 --> 00:51:36,764
will become a sworn enemy.

892
00:51:36,898 --> 00:51:38,465
Okay, okay! Sheesh!

893
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,300
No need to get
all growly on me, buddy.

894
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:43,538
You guys are always telling us
to make good choices.

895
00:51:43,671 --> 00:51:45,707
Well, this is the right choice.

896
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,274
Okay.

897
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:49,644
I guess
we're going to...

898
00:51:49,777 --> 00:51:53,581
["London Town"
by Mr Eazi playing]

899
00:52:05,325 --> 00:52:07,427
London, baby!

900
00:52:10,397 --> 00:52:12,800
GUN Headquarters
is right there.

901
00:52:12,934 --> 00:52:17,137
Let me go in, get the key
and destroy anyone in my way!

902
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:18,940
I want revenge.

903
00:52:19,073 --> 00:52:20,340
[Gerald]
Patience, Shadow.

904
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:22,910
Just let us handle this...

905
00:52:23,678 --> 00:52:27,147
and I promise
you'll have revenge

906
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,085
on a scale you couldn't
possibly imagine.

907
00:52:31,218 --> 00:52:34,221
Come on, Granddaddy-O,
we've got...

908
00:52:34,354 --> 00:52:35,623
dirt to do!

909
00:52:35,757 --> 00:52:37,592
Suits.

910
00:52:37,725 --> 00:52:38,726
Right here, sir.

911
00:52:39,527 --> 00:52:41,428
Stone, babysit the hedgehog.

912
00:52:41,562 --> 00:52:44,364
Keep the crab on a low boil.

913
00:52:45,265 --> 00:52:47,735
It's time
for more family bonding.

914
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:53,708
Come on, Shadow.

915
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:58,245
Got fresh avocados in the crab.
We'll make guac.

916
00:52:59,814 --> 00:53:01,683
Revenge guac!

917
00:53:09,157 --> 00:53:13,661
Guys, are you ready for me yet?
I've been waiting here all day.

918
00:53:16,263 --> 00:53:19,133
Sonic,
we literally just started.

919
00:53:19,266 --> 00:53:21,435
Tom, Maddie,
are you in position and ready?

920
00:53:21,569 --> 00:53:23,671
We were born ready.
Let's do this.

921
00:53:23,805 --> 00:53:25,205
[Tails]
<i>Knuckles, how about you?</i>

922
00:53:25,338 --> 00:53:27,441
I have taken my perch
atop the giant clock.

923
00:53:27,575 --> 00:53:30,310
Now, where is this glass
I'm supposed to break?

924
00:53:30,444 --> 00:53:31,813
Actually, Knucks, your job

925
00:53:31,946 --> 00:53:34,649
is to "Break Glass
in Case of Emergency."

926
00:53:34,782 --> 00:53:35,950
Understood.

927
00:53:36,084 --> 00:53:39,486
I will shatter this glass
like the jaw of a vile foe.

928
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,556
In case of emergency.

929
00:53:41,689 --> 00:53:44,458
<i>I will pulverize it like</i>
<i>the skull of a loathsome rival!</i>

930
00:53:44,592 --> 00:53:47,895
Just to be clear,
the "emergency"
is the important part.

931
00:53:48,029 --> 00:53:49,530
The glass will beg for mercy

932
00:53:49,664 --> 00:53:52,133
under the shadow
of my mighty fist!

933
00:53:52,265 --> 00:53:53,835
Guys, remember,
we're a team.

934
00:53:53,968 --> 00:53:55,235
Let's focus.
Please.

[Sonic] <i>You know what?</i>
<i>Let's move on.</i>

936

937
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:00,708
Tom and Maddie,
you guys plant the USB drive.

938
00:54:00,842 --> 00:54:03,477
I'll disable the traps.
Sonic will snag the launch key.

939
00:54:03,611 --> 00:54:05,412
And Knuckles, you stand by to--

940
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:08,049
Break glass in case
of emergency.

941
00:54:08,182 --> 00:54:09,349
See? He gets it.

942
00:54:09,483 --> 00:54:10,985
Then we're all set.

943
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,787
Hologram time.

944
00:54:14,222 --> 00:54:15,388
You go first.

945
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:18,793
Tom, it's me, Rachel!

946
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:20,795
Can you believe it?
We're both in London together.

947
00:54:20,928 --> 00:54:22,997
Have you met your sister?
Try again.

948
00:54:23,131 --> 00:54:24,165
Unless...

949
00:54:24,297 --> 00:54:25,900
you're not
up for this mission.

950
00:54:26,033 --> 00:54:28,435
Yeah, maybe you want
to be back in Green Hills,
baking sourdough.

951
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:30,303
Thomas Michael Wachowski!
Gah!

952
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:31,773
You brought aliens
to my wedding,

953
00:54:31,906 --> 00:54:33,775
punched out my husband
and buried me in an avalanche.

954
00:54:33,908 --> 00:54:36,077
Your day of reckoning
is at hand!

955
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,211
Yeah, that's perfect.

956
00:54:37,344 --> 00:54:39,914
Okay, now for
her better half.

957
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:46,353
Ho-ho, my name is Randall,
and I am too much to handle!

958
00:54:46,486 --> 00:54:47,989
Welcome to the gun show!

959
00:54:48,122 --> 00:54:51,391
Baby, would you describe me
as jacked, juiced,

960
00:54:51,526 --> 00:54:53,694
or shredded?

961
00:54:53,828 --> 00:54:55,563
I would describe your head
as swollen.

962
00:54:55,696 --> 00:54:57,297
Let's get to work.

963

Agent Randall Handel.

964
00:55:02,203 --> 00:55:04,939
I'm here to have lunch
with my lovely wife, Rachel.

965
00:55:05,072 --> 00:55:06,541
[desk guard]
I'm sorry, Agent Handel,

966
00:55:06,674 --> 00:55:09,110
this facility's
currently locked down.

967
00:55:09,243 --> 00:55:10,945
Command-level
clearance only.

968
00:55:11,078 --> 00:55:13,080
One minute.

969
00:55:13,815 --> 00:55:16,017
Tails... we have a problem here.

970
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:19,287
Wow, they must have
tightened security

01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,749
The Master Emerald.

1294
01:13:34,882 --> 01:13:38,252
The Emerald must never be
wielded for vengeance.

1295
01:13:38,386 --> 01:13:39,419
Not ever!

1296
01:13:39,553 --> 01:13:41,055
We swore a sacred oath.

1297
01:13:41,188 --> 01:13:43,391
Don't talk to me about oaths.
Not now!

1298
01:13:43,524 --> 01:13:45,425
But you told Tom
using the Emerald

1299
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:46,928
wasn't the right choice.

1300
01:13:47,061 --> 01:13:49,096
Well, now it's the only choice.

1301
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:51,299
And if neither of you
have the guts to help me,

1302
01:13:51,431 --> 01:13:52,767
then I'll do it alone.

1303
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,969
But I thought
the three of us
were a team.

1304
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:57,338
I thought that's what
made us special.

1305
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:59,540
I'm not asking you twice,
Knuckles.

1306
01:14:00,207 --> 01:14:03,077
Where is the Master Emerald?

1307
01:14:04,645 --> 01:14:07,915
Your heart is being consumed
by anger, hedgehog.

1308
01:14:08,049 --> 01:14:11,085
You are in no condition
to make decisions right now.

1309
01:14:11,218 --> 01:14:14,121
I know you're upset about Tom.
We all are.

1310
01:14:14,255 --> 01:14:16,023
Last chance.

1311
01:14:16,157 --> 01:14:18,859
Where... is it?

1312
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:20,928
Don't do this.

1313
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:30,404
Part of our oath
is to trust each other.

1314
01:14:30,538 --> 01:14:32,707
And I must abide
by that promise,

1315
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:35,309
even if you have chosen
to break it.

1316
01:14:35,443 --> 01:14:37,011
But heed this warning:

1317
01:14:37,144 --> 01:14:40,648
The Master Emerald is guarded
by a fearsome warrior.

1318
01:14:40,781 --> 01:14:43,150
And to seize
this ultimate power,

1319
01:14:43,284 --> 01:14:45,219
you will have to go...

1320
01:14:45,353 --> 01:14:47,388
through him.

1321
01:14:47,521 --> 01:14:48,622
[exhales deeply]

1322
01:14:48,756 --> 01:14:51,692
Okay, Wade...
all comes down to this.

1323
01:14:52,259 --> 01:14:53,761
Last few seconds.

1324
01:14:53,894 --> 01:14:55,229
Whipple down the ice.

1325
01:14:55,363 --> 01:14:58,766
He shoots... he scores!

1326
01:14:58,899 --> 01:15:02,169
Wade Whipple
is a champion again!

1327

[cackles]

1328
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:11,245
Oh, hey, Sonic. See my goal?
Pretty sick, right?

1329
01:15:11,379 --> 01:15:13,247
I'm here for the Emerald.

1330
01:15:13,381 --> 01:15:14,782
Look, Sonic, I'm sorry.

1331
01:15:14,915 --> 01:15:17,284
I promised to guard this emerald
with my life.

1332
01:15:17,418 --> 01:15:19,286
I will do whatever it takes--

1333
01:15:20,388 --> 01:15:21,689
Well, I tried.

1334
01:15:23,391 --> 01:15:25,793

Professor, is this really
what Maria would have wanted?

1344
01:16:26,555 --> 01:16:30,291
The question isn't
what Maria would have wanted.

1345
01:16:31,158 --> 01:16:33,627
It's what do they deserve.

1346
01:16:34,395 --> 01:16:36,997
Remember what she meant to us.

1347
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:41,836
Remember what they took from us.

1348

That's my little secret.

1368
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:47,127
The Eclipse Cannon
is about to turn this planet

1369
01:18:47,261 --> 01:18:50,064
into a flaming pile
of rubble,

1370
01:18:50,197 --> 01:18:55,302
wiping out everything
in a 25,000-mile radius.

01:18:58,439 --> 01:19:00,808
Including us.

1372
01:19:04,512 --> 01:19:05,714
What?

1373
01:19:06,413 --> 01:19:09,483
We can't annihilate
the Earth!

1374
01:19:09,618 --> 01:19:14,421
Hmm?
By combining our genius,
we can rule humanity.

1375
01:19:14,556 --> 01:19:15,489
Together!

1376
01:19:15,624 --> 01:19:18,693
Humanity is a failed experiment.

1377
01:19:18,826 --> 01:19:21,228
If anyone should know that,
it's you.

1378
01:19:22,564 --> 01:19:25,966
All your life, you've been
rejected by this world.

1379
01:19:26,635 --> 01:19:28,369
You have nothing down there.

1380
01:19:29,837 --> 01:19:32,106
No one who cares about you.

1381
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:35,376
But I have you now.

1382
01:19:37,911 --> 01:19:39,446
We're family.

1383
01:19:40,381 --> 01:19:42,082
We have each other.

1384
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:44,885
Oh, Ivo...

1385
01:19:46,521 --> 01:19:48,289
you're no Maria.

1386
01:19:51,325 --> 01:19:55,530
The moment I lost her,
my family was gone forever!

1387
01:19:57,031 --> 01:19:58,832
The only way
to give Maria's life
meaning

1388
01:19:58,966 --> 01:20:01,402
is to destroy the world
that took her from me.

1389
01:20:02,069 --> 01:20:04,405
So I'm burning it all down!

1390
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,309
It's done.

1391
01:20:08,442 --> 01:20:10,679
Good work, Shadow.

1392
01:20:10,811 --> 01:20:12,479
I'm prepping
the firing sequence.

1393

The weapon will be fully charged
in ten minutes.

1394
01:20:20,722 --> 01:20:23,023
It's almost finished, Maria.

1395
01:20:23,725 --> 01:20:25,993
You will have justice.

Is GUN launching
missiles at us?

1399
01:20:35,804 --> 01:20:39,073
Impossible.
It's moving too fast.

1400
01:20:42,009 --> 01:20:43,877
It's him.

You hurt my family.
This ends now!

01:20:56,624 --> 01:20:58,158
Now you know my anger.

1405
01:20:58,292 --> 01:21:01,195
The pain I've felt
for 50 years.

1406
01:21:01,328 --> 01:21:04,766
And you've made
the same choice I did.

1407
01:21:04,898 --> 01:21:06,568
I'm nothing like you!

1408

I was saving it for Comic-Con.

1448

Abandons his family!

Don't you dare talk

you cared for them.

1619
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:09,970
dedicating my final livestream

1620
01:36:10,104 --> 01:36:13,140
to one very special henchman:

1621
01:36:13,608 --> 01:36:14,908
<i>Agent Stone.</i>

1622
01:36:15,042 --> 01:36:17,211
No, no. Doctor, wait!

1623
01:36:17,344 --> 01:36:20,114
<i>If I can't</i>
<i>rule the world...</i>

1624
01:36:20,881 --> 01:36:22,517
I might as well save it...

1625
01:36:22,651 --> 01:36:25,986
for the one and only person
who ever cared about me.

1626
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:28,055
Don't do this, Doctor, please!

1627
01:36:28,188 --> 01:36:32,126
Stone, you were more
than a sycophant to me.

1628
01:36:34,795 --> 01:36:36,230
You were...

1629
01:36:37,599 --> 01:36:39,233
a syco-friend.

1630
01:36:44,438 --> 01:36:48,309
I'll miss your lattes
with steamed Austrian goat milk.

1631
01:36:50,044 --> 01:36:52,179
I love the way you make 'em!

1632
01:37:34,789 --> 01:37:39,126
So... I guess there's
only one thing left to say.

1633
01:37:39,728 --> 01:37:42,296
[mimics robotic servos]

1634
01:37:43,732 --> 01:37:45,332
It's been a real drag.

1635
01:37:45,866 --> 01:37:47,468
Thanks for nothing.

1636
01:37:59,614 --> 01:38:01,315

1638
01:38:05,919 --> 01:38:07,287
Sonic, look.

1639
01:38:17,231 --> 01:38:19,133
Shadow and Robotnik.

1640
01:38:19,266 --> 01:38:21,669
They sacrificed
themselves...

1641
01:38:21,803 --> 01:38:24,037
to save everyone.

1642
01:38:24,606 --> 01:38:26,641
You always have a choice.

1643
01:38:27,609 --> 01:38:30,411
Guys, I'm really sorry
for running off like that.

1644
01:38:30,545 --> 01:38:32,479
I shouldn't have
left you behind.

1645
01:38:34,081 --> 01:38:35,550
The truth is...

1646
01:38:35,683 --> 01:38:38,653
you're the best teammates
a hedgehog could ever ask for.

1647
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:42,089
And the best friends.

1648
01:38:42,222 --> 01:38:44,358
Can you ever forgive me?

1649
01:38:48,429 --> 01:38:50,264
Team Sonic?

1650
01:38:54,101 --> 01:38:57,037
[Sonic]
How about just "team"?

1651
01:39:05,045 --> 01:39:06,980
Goodbye, Doctor.

1652
01:39:23,163 --> 01:39:25,633
[Sonic] Big finish.
[Knuckles] Mmm!

1653
01:39:27,034 --> 01:39:29,604
Now that's
what I call teamwork.

1654
01:39:29,737 --> 01:39:31,573
Okay! It's ready!

1655
01:39:31,706 --> 01:39:33,307
[munching]

[gasps]

1657
01:39:34,709 --> 01:39:36,210
Knuckles,
how could you?

1658
01:39:36,343 --> 01:39:38,445
Gotta be faster than that!

1659
01:39:39,146 --> 01:39:40,214
Give me a break.

1660
01:39:40,347 --> 01:39:41,816
Still moving a little slow
over here.

1661
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:43,785
Donut Lord!
Yay!

1662
01:39:43,918 --> 01:39:45,319
[pained groan]

1663
01:39:45,452 --> 01:39:48,388
Okay, Knuckles, that's...
I am having the love.

1664
01:39:48,523 --> 01:39:49,824
[barks]

1665
01:39:49,958 --> 01:39:52,493
[Tails] Aww...
Get in here, Ozzy.

1666
01:39:52,627 --> 01:39:54,629
It's great
to be back together.

1667
01:39:54,762 --> 01:39:56,430
We're stronger than ever.

1668
01:39:56,564 --> 01:39:59,333
And nothing is gonna
stand in our way.

1669
01:40:00,367 --> 01:40:04,471
Except that one piece
of unfinished business.

1670
01:40:13,046 --> 01:40:16,283
And way out in front, to the
surprise of absolutely no one,

1671
01:40:16,416 --> 01:40:17,785
it's the Blue Blur!

1672

Often imitated,
never duplicated,

[yells]

1675
01:40:22,089 --> 01:40:23,691
Let's do this!

1676
01:40:23,825 --> 01:40:25,960
Yeah! [laughs]

1677
01:40:26,093 --> 01:40:29,396
[yells]
All right, boys,
try and keep up.

1678
01:40:29,931 --> 01:40:32,065
[all cheering, whooping]

["Run It"

1680

Sonic the Hedgehog
is Family Champion once again!

1681
01:42:29,884 --> 01:42:31,151
Tails?

1682
01:42:31,586 --> 01:42:33,220
Knuckles?

1683
01:42:34,488 --> 01:42:37,692
Okay. Yeah, I overshot
the finish line.

1684

[electronic whirring]

1685
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:49,637
[Sonic] Okay,
so how do I get back?

[Sonic] Pro tip:

1689
01:43:02,150 --> 01:43:03,316
If you're gonna take a shot

1690
01:43:03,450 --> 01:43:05,787
at the fastest creature
in the universe...

1691
01:43:08,056 --> 01:43:09,757
you'd better not miss.

1692
01:43:13,393 --> 01:43:16,097
Um... I'm flattered
by the cosplay,

1693
01:43:16,263 --> 01:43:17,765
but you got
a few details wrong.

1694
01:43:17,899 --> 01:43:21,268
I can't blame you, though.
It's hard to copy perfection.

1695
01:43:31,112 --> 01:43:33,346
That's a neat trick.

1696

[Sonic yelps]
