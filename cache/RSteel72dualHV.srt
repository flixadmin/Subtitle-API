1
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:15,604
Hang on, hang on. Come on.

2
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:19,983
<i>Where are you, Charlie?
More importantly, where is my money?</i>

3
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,320
- You're into me for 30 grand.
- Jack, I'm going to pay you.

4
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:25,864
<i>This ain't Jack! It's Bill Panner.</i>

5
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:29,409
<i>You owe Jack money, too?
You pay me first!</i>

6
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:34,248
Bill. We're good, buddy. I got your
money. It's right here in my hand.

7
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,291
Why don't we meet up on the...?

8
00:03:41,004 --> 00:03:43,924
<i>- Your phone's going all screwy. Hello?</i>
- <i>I'm losing</i> you.

9
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,468
<i>I can't hear what you're say...</i>

10
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:51,723
Hey, mister. Is that Ambush?

11
00:03:53,392 --> 00:03:55,644
- Yeah.
- Can we see him?

12
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:59,314
- You want to see him?
- Yeah.

13
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:01,733
Give me a minute.

14
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:09,158
This...

15
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:13,453
is Ambush. Wakey, wakey.

16
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:36,852
- What robot is he fighting?
- Actually he's going to fight...

17
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:38,538
Whoa, little lady. What are you doing?

18
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:39,897
Can we get a picture with him?

19
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,607
Sure. For five dollars.

20
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:43,901
You want five dollars? Seriously?

21
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:46,570
No, I want five dollars immediately.

22
00:04:46,737 --> 00:04:48,280
Come on, guys.

23
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:53,243
- All right, I'm kidding. Three bucks.
- Whatever.

24
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,163
- How about $2.50?
- You suck!

25
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:01,752
It's going to be one
of those towns, huh?

26
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:07,549
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.</i>

27
00:05:07,716 --> 00:05:11,261
<i>Please take your seats. We're almost
ready to get this thing started.</i>

28
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,933
I was told my bot
was fighting an 800-pound steer.

29
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:18,685
That is not 800 pounds, Knucklehead.

30
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:23,774
Charlie "the Can Do Kid" Kenton. Time
has not been good to you, my friend.

31
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:28,445
- Ricky, we got a big problem here.
- Slow down there, hoss.

32
00:05:28,612 --> 00:05:33,242
Last time I saw you, you were staring
at the ceiling at the Sam Houston Center

33
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:35,702
with the taste of my right cross
all over your face.

34
00:05:37,913 --> 00:05:39,623
- Are we good to go here?
- Yeah.

35
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,627
We agreed that my boxer would fight
an 800-pound steer for three grand.

36
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:45,420
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir. We did.

37
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:47,547
That bull is like 2,000 pounds.

38
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,299
I'll tell you something.

39
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:53,679
Your bot don't fight,
you don't get paid! How about that?

40
00:05:55,597 --> 00:05:57,224
Get the hell out of here.

41
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,815
Why don't we make this more interesting.
My bot against your bull, straight up.

42
00:06:04,982 --> 00:06:07,025
- How much?
- Twenty grand, winner takes all.

43
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:09,736
- Twenty grand. You got 20 grand?
- In a safe in my truck.

44
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:14,700
All right, Charlie.

45
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:18,996
Twenty grand it is,
but if you lose and you welch,

46
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:21,641
I'll come after you and beat you
to within an inch of your life.

47
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:23,977
You know that I can do that
because I already done done it!

48
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:27,754
In life you get too close, in the ring
you stand back like a girl. Just shake.

49
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:33,010
All right. Shake and pow! Just like that
once again. You want to dance again?

50
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:36,513
Cheer for this guy. Give him some luck.
He needs some luck, y'all.

51
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,599
Don't touch that bull.

52
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,853
Ladies and gentlemen, I got to ask,

53
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,439
do we have any fans
of robot boxing here today?

54
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,277
Now, listen, friends, I understand

55
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:54,197
we can't all afford to go
all the way over there to Dallas

56
00:06:54,364 --> 00:06:59,202
and pay $300 for one of those
World Robot Boxing League fights.

57
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:02,497
So, I decided that I would bring
a robot boxing match

58
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:06,043
right hereto our little fair
here in San Leandro.

59
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:07,461
How about that?

60
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:14,718
Ladies and gentlemen,
I introduce to you,

61
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:17,429
Ambush!

62
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:18,930
Let's do it!

63
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,934
All right, big fella.

64
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:30,359
He's a big fella, ain't he?

65
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:34,029
Take a turn.
Let them see how beautiful you are.

66
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:39,868
Show them some power.

67
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:43,789
Look at that.
He's getting all kung fu-y on us.

68
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:46,375
Yeah, big fella.

69
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,586
Ambush's opponent today,
he's last year's runner-up

70
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:51,755
in the baddest of the bulls competition,

71
00:07:51,922 --> 00:07:54,674
ladies and gentlemen,

72
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,552
Black Thunder!

73
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:01,681
- Let's get it on!
- Let's get this thing started.

74
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,937
Is that all you got?

75
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:10,941
Yeah, brother. Bring it on.

76
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,327
Take him, take him.

77
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:27,290
Ambush lays the smackdown
on that prime beef.

78
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,411
I got more for you, big fella.
We're just getting started.

79
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,137
OK. Jump, now!

80
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,729
Ambush, decks Black Thunder,

81
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:53,275
but when you mess with the bull,
you're going to get the horns.

82
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,405
You like that. I can tell.
You like that.

83
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,491
Turn around!

84
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:07,747
Ricky! Ricky, stop this thing!

85
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:20,844
Come on. We're still in this thing.
Just hop. Hop.

86
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:23,346
That's it. Come on.

87
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:29,978
Ricky, enough! Enough!

88
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:33,315
I can't hear you over the sound
of your robot being destroyed.

89
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:36,818
Kill! Kill! Kill!

90
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,488
Come on, get up.

91
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:41,740
Get up! Come on!

92
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:46,453
No!

93
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,251
Come on, no. No, no, no!

94
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:03,053
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
for our warriors out here today

95
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,764
at the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

96
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:07,849
Thank you for coming out,

97
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:11,603
and we'll see you next time,
because there will be one.

98
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:13,730
Give me that leg.

99
00:10:13,897 --> 00:10:15,732
Sure. For five dollars.

100
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,567
<i>Boo-yaw.!</i>

101
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:24,199
All right! That was ridonculous fun,
now wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?

102
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:28,703
I'm going to come by for my money,
Charlie boy. You best have it.

103
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,914
- Everybody say "hey!"
- Hey!

104
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:34,751
FY who!"
" Ho!

105
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:38,129
How about that?
How you doing there, little robot?

106
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,523
My keys, damn it.

107
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,520
One more step
and I'll drop you like your girlfriend.

108
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:00,694
Charlie, relax.

109
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,780
I'm not paying you. That was a bogus
fight. It cost me my last robot.

110
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:06,783
- Just listen to us.
- Do you recall Caroline Fallon?

111
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:10,534
She's my ex-girlfriend. I haven't seen
her in ten years. What does she want?

112
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,289
Nothing. She died.

113
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,583
Do you recall Max Kenton?

114
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:18,128
He's my son. He's got to be nine.

115
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:19,921
- Eleven.
- Eleven. OK.

116
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,924
Is he dead, too?

117
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:25,802
No, he's fine. That's why we're here.

118
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,832
This court is convened
to address the custodial status

119
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:58,293
of one Max Kenton, age 11.

120
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,922
Mother, Caroline Fallon, deceased.
Father, Charles Kenton.

121
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,133
Debra Fallon Barnes,
you're the boy's aunt.

122
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:10,597
Yes. As I've already told you,
my husband, Marvin, is wealthy,

123
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:14,184
and we can more than provide for Max.

124
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:17,729
I appreciate that, but per Texas
state law, without a written will

125
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:19,773
next of kin retains custody.

126
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:23,109
Charles Kenton,
who is aware of this custody hearing,

127
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,653
and we are expecting him...

128
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:27,280
I need a new robot now.

129
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,783
I had a big fight
for Ambush next Saturday.

130
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,326
I got to show up with something.

131
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:36,289
Noisy Boy is for sale?
In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.

132
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:39,042
How much? That's a good deal.
What's wrong with him?

133
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,544
I can live with that.

134
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,255
I don't have it.

135
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:48,468
Charles Kenton waived all of his rights
to custody right after the boy was born.

136
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:51,137
I can more than provide for Max.

137
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,724
Please be Charles Kenton.

138
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,229
Charlie, yeah.

139
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:02,899
I'm hereto sign some paper
that releases my rights

140
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:04,984
to the custody of my son.

141
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,070
That's why I'm here.
Do I need to be here?

142
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:08,530
Charlie.

143
00:13:09,572 --> 00:13:10,907
Do you even remember me?

144
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:14,285
- Debra, Carmine's sister.
- Yeah, Debra. How are you?

145
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:16,371
Mr Kenton. Please take a seat.

146
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,836
Your Honour, may I please go
and see my nephew now?

147
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,045
Yes, you may.

148
00:13:24,212 --> 00:13:25,922
- How about you, Mr Kenton?
- What?

149
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:28,591
You can spend some time
with him, if you'd like.

150
00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:30,385
- With the kid?
- Yeah, the kid.

151
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:32,345
- Max. Your son?
- All right.

152
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:35,265
You've been working with those robots
for so long, you've become one.

153
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,936
Honey, you wait right here.
I'm going to be back.

154
00:13:39,102 --> 00:13:41,604
You take all the time you need,
sweetheart.

155
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:50,113
Your Honour, I'd like to,
at this juncture,

156
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,824
step out and call my attorney,
if that's all right.

157
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:53,992
Please.

158
00:13:57,787 --> 00:14:01,958
Come on. Come on. There you are.

159
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,795
He'll be in a foster home.

160
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:10,008
No, they find good families.
Young. Energetic. Yeah.

161
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:14,804
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.

162
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,019
- Marvin Barnes. I'm Debra's husband.
- Right, yeah.

163
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:24,147
Debra really wants to adopt Max.

164
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:29,569
- I'm up for it. But...
- Seventy-five grand.

165
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,823
$75,000? You're serious?

166
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:37,994
The thing is...

167
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:41,247
we're supposed to go
to Italy this summer

168
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,082
with my oldest friend and his wife.

169
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,335
Two months in Tuscany and all over.

170
00:14:45,502 --> 00:14:46,862
Just the four of you. Sounds nice.

171
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:49,297
We'll be back in New York
by the end of August.

172
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,218
In August. A hundred.

173
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:55,303
- $100,000?
- You heard me.

174
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,680
- You're crazy.
- Not nearly as crazy as your wife

175
00:14:57,847 --> 00:15:01,184
if you tell her I just signed over
that kid to the state of Texas.

176
00:15:01,351 --> 00:15:04,896
There's a real way everyone gets
what they want here.

177
00:15:05,063 --> 00:15:07,190
So here's what you're going to do.

178
00:15:07,357 --> 00:15:10,401
You're going to tell your wife
I'll only sign over custody to her

179
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:12,695
if I get to spend the summer
with the kid first.

180
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:15,281
Just tell her how guilty
she made me feel

181
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,700
for being such
a terrible absentee dad,

182
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:21,913
how I want to make good with junior,
a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.

183
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,959
She'll buy it, you get to be the hero
and everybody wins.

184
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:32,757
OK. But not a word about the money
to Debra, you understand?

185
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:35,301
I understand.

186
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,720
I'll give you 50 grand tonight
when we drop off Max

187
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:40,181
and the other 50
when we get back in August

188
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:42,141
and you deliver him to us in New York.

189
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,519
Pleasure doing business with you.

190
00:15:47,355 --> 00:15:49,607
Your Honour,
I'm happy we all took the time

191
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:51,334
to make the best decision for everyone.

192
00:15:54,863 --> 00:15:56,364
- Happy?
- Yeah, it's me.

193
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:59,742
I'm buying Noisy Boy. I got the money.

194
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:02,453
Take him to Tallet's Gym
and I'll meet you there.

195
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,761
Hello?

196
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:21,264
Bailey?

197
00:16:21,431 --> 00:16:23,231
Some guy is here
with the robot you're buying,

198
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:25,518
and it smells like disaster to me.

199
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,020
Nice to see you, too.

200
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:30,023
- Might I also say how cute you look.
- Give it up.

201
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,693
God, I need a shower.
You want to take a shower? Come on.

202
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,612
Let me make something clear.

203
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:38,615
A creepy dude with a robot in a box

204
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:41,075
has been sitting outside my gym
for two hours.

205
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:43,077
Putting aside the fact
that you're doing

206
00:16:43,244 --> 00:16:45,955
what I'm guessing is
a black market deal on my doorstep,

207
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:48,162
how will you pay him
when Ambush just got destroyed?

208
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:50,084
The money is on its way.
Just distract him.

209
00:16:50,251 --> 00:16:51,628
I have been. It's exhausting.

210
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:53,630
- You're the best.
- Yeah? Really?

211
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:56,799
Is that why you're buying a $45,000
robot when you owe me six grand in rent?

212
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:58,301
- Because I'm the best?
- Three.

213
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:03,723
Six. There is a guy with real money
who wants to buy this place.

214
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,130
Come on. Like you're really
going to sell your dad's gym.

215
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,312
If you don't make rent, I can't make
payments and I won't have a choice.

216
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:11,457
Your father would climb out of his grave
and kick your ass

217
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:13,375
- if you sold this place.
- My father would climb out of his grave

218
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,734
and kick your ass.

219
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,404
Bailey?

220
00:17:24,535 --> 00:17:25,536
- Don't.
- Don't what?

221
00:17:25,703 --> 00:17:27,163
Don't do that.

222
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,292
- Don't what?
- Don't do that thing.

223
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:35,713
- No, you like that thing.
- No.

224
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,007
- Yeah.
- No, I don't like that thing.

225
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:42,053
I used to. Once. Briefly.
Now I like money more.

226
00:17:42,971 --> 00:17:45,974
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

227
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:49,394
Marvin.

228
00:17:50,478 --> 00:17:52,522
Your money has arrived.

229
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:55,900
<i>Maw .</i>

230
00:18:00,363 --> 00:18:02,532
Fifty grand, as promised.

231
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:08,621
Here are all our numbers
and contact info over in Europe.

232
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,415
So that's everything there.

233
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:16,170
So Marvin tells me
you want this time with Max.

234
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:18,548
- Yeah.
- You did the right thing,

235
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:19,841
giving me custody.

236
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:21,342
Caroline would have wanted that.

237
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:25,221
Now, have him back in New York
on August 27th.

238
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:27,849
That's a deal.

239
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:32,437
OK, let's go get Max.
OK? Let's get Max.

240
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:39,402
It's OK. You want to go around
the other side here and I'll get Max?

241
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:44,365
Hey. Max. See you, pal.

242
00:18:45,408 --> 00:18:47,952
Max, we'll see you
at the end of the summer, honey.

243
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,255
I'm Charlie.

244
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,887
It's been a long time.
You know, I'm your...

245
00:19:06,054 --> 00:19:08,097
- You screwed me.
- Nice mouth.

246
00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:09,408
Do you know where they're going?

247
00:19:09,432 --> 00:19:11,309
- Italy?
- Yeah, Italy.

248
00:19:11,476 --> 00:19:12,953
So how did I get stuck here with you?

249
00:19:12,977 --> 00:19:15,813
Relax, kid. You got a whole life
of fine living ahead of you.

250
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,981
Charlie!

251
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,609
Dude's pissed. He's going to take off.

252
00:19:21,402 --> 00:19:23,905
- Did Marvin give you that money?
- Here, just close the deal.

253
00:19:24,072 --> 00:19:25,573
I'll be right there, OK?

254
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:32,663
- I'm Bailey.
- Max.

255
00:19:34,457 --> 00:19:35,792
Max Kenton.

256
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,128
- So this is your...
- Yeah, it's him.

257
00:19:39,295 --> 00:19:40,630
Don't worry about it, OK?

258
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:43,216
I'm looking at you two and...

259
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,676
Just go and put Noisy
in the shop, please? Thank you.

260
00:19:52,683 --> 00:19:54,745
You're going to stay here with her
while I'm on the road.

261
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:57,522
- How much did he give you?
- You're coming at this the wrong way.

262
00:19:57,688 --> 00:19:59,357
No, tell me. I want to know.

263
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,735
Fifty thousand, OK?

264
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,238
He gave me $50,000
to sign you over to her.

265
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,864
Will you shut up now?

266
00:20:07,532 --> 00:20:08,658
You sold me?

267
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:11,452
Sounds worse than it is.

268
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:14,247
- Really.
- It's to take care of you.

269
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,974
Give me half the money
and you won't have to.

270
00:20:15,998 --> 00:20:18,668
- Where are you going to go?
- Give me the money. I'll be fine.

271
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:21,230
I told your aunt I'll get you
to New York at the end of the summer.

272
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:22,755
Now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?

273
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:26,134
You sold me for 50 grand.
You owe me half!

274
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,555
I don't have it! I spent the money
on a robot. It's gone! OK? Gone!

275
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:32,056
I'm through here.

276
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,692
What do we got?

277
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:44,527
Noisy Boy has arrived.

278
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:48,114
That's a lot of airline stickers
and customs tags.

279
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:51,826
- He's been all over the world.
- London, Japan, Brazil, Sao Paulo...

280
00:20:51,993 --> 00:20:54,453
Hasn't seen North American soil
in over two years.

281
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,747
Maybe that's why you got
such a good price, genius.

282
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:01,377
Decided to stay?

283
00:21:02,211 --> 00:21:05,173
This is Bailey. She'll be looking
after you for a few weeks.

284
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:08,009
I need you to look after the kid
for a few weeks.

285
00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:10,887
- I want half that money.
- Are we back to this again?

286
00:21:12,722 --> 00:21:14,557
Is there a real robot boxer in there?

287
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:16,444
Noisy Boy's in there.
You ever heard of him?

288
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:20,062
Of course. He fought Rubicon
for the WRB belt in 2016.

289
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,321
Holy crap, he looks amazing.

290
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:34,202
His composite armour has been replaced.
Let's see if the insides look as good.

291
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:37,955
I've watched that fight
with Rubicon like 20 times.

292
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:39,874
He should have had him
in the third round,

293
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,710
but Rubicon got lucky
with a huge right and ended it.

294
00:21:56,766 --> 00:21:58,726
Relax, kid, he's on our side.

295
00:21:58,893 --> 00:22:00,770
- Not funny.
- Kind of funny.

296
00:22:00,937 --> 00:22:02,537
You know he has voice recognition,
right?

297
00:22:02,605 --> 00:22:04,325
- No, he doesn't.
- He didn't in the League.

298
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:06,543
When Noisy fought in Brazil,
they must have put it in.

299
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:09,111
Brazilians are crazy
about that talk-to-your-robot crap.

300
00:22:12,073 --> 00:22:13,699
Right, left, uppercut!

301
00:22:17,286 --> 00:22:20,915
Doesn't work. Right, left, uppercut!

302
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:23,363
I knew that price was too good
to be true. We got screwed.

303
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:25,962
- Let me see if I can fix it.
- Look how good he looks, too.

304
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:28,089
Give me two seconds.
Let me look at something!

305
00:22:28,256 --> 00:22:30,424
- Why didn't you ask to look at it?
- Relax!

306
00:22:35,638 --> 00:22:37,431
Was that Japanese?

307
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,146
Let me see if I can reset him
to English.

308
00:22:44,313 --> 00:22:45,815
How do you know Japanese?

309
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:47,400
Video games.

310
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:50,152
You play video games in Japanese?

311
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,988
Japanese bootlegs are always better.

312
00:22:57,827 --> 00:22:59,203
Give me that.

313
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,581
He's reset to English,
and I found his command matrix.

314
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,001
They have pre-loaded
a bunch of combinations.

315
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:07,503
They should be listed here.

316
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:10,923
Top salvo!

317
00:23:14,135 --> 00:23:15,219
What did I tell you?

318
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:18,139
Gravity One Downtown!

319
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:24,478
I was due for some good luck!

320
00:23:24,645 --> 00:23:26,188
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

321
00:23:26,355 --> 00:23:29,275
Bailey, help me put him in the truck.
I am going to go and get your money.

322
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:45,041
- Give me the keys.
- I'm coming with you.

323
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:46,876
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

324
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:48,836
Because I don't want you with me, OK?

325
00:23:49,003 --> 00:23:52,757
I'm either coming with you, or you're
fishing for your keys in the sewer.

326
00:23:52,923 --> 00:23:55,718
Your choice.
What's it going to be, old man?

327
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,513
Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?

328
00:24:01,223 --> 00:24:03,976
- Don't do that again.
- That's scaring you, isn't it?

329
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,728
Don't do this again?

330
00:24:06,395 --> 00:24:08,731
Get in. Just get in.
Give me the keys first.

331
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:11,442
Wait till I get in the truck.
Thanks, Big Pops.

332
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,408
Sweet ride.

333
00:24:19,575 --> 00:24:22,244
Put on your seatbelt and don't talk.

334
00:24:43,391 --> 00:24:45,768
I'm taking all bets!

335
00:25:11,293 --> 00:25:13,087
Keep up. Stay close.

336
00:25:16,632 --> 00:25:19,176
Charlie Kenton is in the house!

337
00:25:19,343 --> 00:25:21,762
- All right, all right.
- Come on, man!

338
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,850
- Is that Noisy Boy?
- The one and only.

339
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,977
That's Noisy Boy!

340
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:34,859
Noisy's been in Japan.
Softer bots over there.

341
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:37,278
- Sure you want to fight him tonight?
- What do you got?

342
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:39,572
He can take any bot in this place.
You know it.

343
00:25:41,115 --> 00:25:42,783
You can have any undercard you want.

344
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,285
Five thousand guaranteed.

345
00:25:44,452 --> 00:25:47,329
A thousand every round
your bot survives.

346
00:25:47,496 --> 00:25:49,331
Fight till the death!

347
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:54,420
No. Give me the main event.

348
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:56,755
- Come on.
- This is Noisy Boy.

349
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,466
An original Tak Mashido bot.

350
00:25:58,632 --> 00:26:01,302
He was a World Robot League boxer.
Come on!

351
00:26:04,054 --> 00:26:05,890
You want to fight Midas?

352
00:26:06,056 --> 00:26:09,185
Fifty thousand guaranteed,
winner takes all.

353
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:13,689
Fifty? Really, 50? Now you're talking.

354
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:15,691
Listen, listen. No, look.

355
00:26:15,858 --> 00:26:17,485
- Listen!
- Give me a sec.

356
00:26:17,651 --> 00:26:20,863
We should take an undercard fight,
make a little cash and get out of here!

357
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,323
First, there is no "we."

358
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,659
Second, he's going to crush Midas,
and I'm going to make real cash!

359
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,454
We'll take Midas!

360
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,677
Tonight, our main event

361
00:26:43,844 --> 00:26:48,766
features the gold-blooded killer!

362
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:52,728
This pimped-out punk

363
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:56,565
is programmed for pain!

364
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:02,404
I give to you the mighty Midas!

365
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,115
Against a bot

366
00:27:46,282 --> 00:27:51,036
who ran with the big boys in the WRB!

367
00:27:51,954 --> 00:27:57,084
He's been on an exile tour overseas,
but now he's back home,

368
00:27:57,251 --> 00:27:59,545
and he's ready to make some noise!

369
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:03,382
Take your first look in a long time

370
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:08,220
at Noisy Boy!

371
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,926
Crash Palace,

372
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:52,931
who's ready for some destruction?!

373
00:28:54,141 --> 00:28:57,686
Let's make some money! Come on!

374
00:28:57,853 --> 00:29:00,606
We have Midas against Noisy Boy.

375
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:02,775
Noisy Boy against Midas.

376
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:06,195
You've been waiting all night
for this matchup, Crash Palace!

377
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:13,744
Scimitar right!

378
00:29:16,914 --> 00:29:18,540
Did you see that?

379
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:21,835
Easy money, easy money all night.
All night long!

380
00:29:22,002 --> 00:29:25,130
Come on! It's not over yet. Let's go!

381
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:27,341
Skull salvo! Firefight!

382
00:29:30,052 --> 00:29:33,055
- Yeah! Go, Noisy!
- Undercard, huh?

383
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:36,850
Shockfist!

384
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,897
Get in there. Shogun Trinity!

385
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,734
Let's finish him. Gravity Slam, Uptown!

386
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,739
This son-of-a-bitch is crazy!

387
00:29:53,242 --> 00:29:55,411
Full Metal Feud! Bring it!

388
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,666
Southpaw! Pain Revolution!

389
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:03,252
I got something for you.

390
00:30:04,586 --> 00:30:07,548
Don't you run from me!
You can't run from me!

391
00:30:09,591 --> 00:30:10,759
Get up!

392
00:30:13,887 --> 00:30:14,972
That's illegal!

393
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:17,266
This is the underworld.
There are no rules!

394
00:30:18,225 --> 00:30:19,727
Now we're seeing the Midas touch.

395
00:30:19,893 --> 00:30:21,103
No. Hands up!

396
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,273
Get back in that corner, bitch,
and take this whooping like a man!

397
00:30:28,235 --> 00:30:29,862
He's getting killed in there!

398
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:36,660
It's a headset! You talk into it
and you tell him what to do!

399
00:30:36,827 --> 00:30:38,120
Panic Shield!

400
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:41,123
That's it. One-Two Overlord!

401
00:30:45,294 --> 00:30:47,880
No, no. Shatter Punch!

402
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:53,927
- Five Recall!
- Get some!

403
00:31:00,142 --> 00:31:01,143
Jab, jab!

404
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:09,651
Right roundhouse!

405
00:31:09,818 --> 00:31:13,155
Did he just spit his juice
in Midas's face?

406
00:31:13,322 --> 00:31:15,866
No, you did not spit in Midas's face!

407
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:18,410
It's party time now, Crash Palace!

408
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:19,661
Use your left!

409
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,414
Noisy's trying to do something
with his one arm!

410
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:25,751
But Midas pins him,
and Daddy goes to work!

411
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,509
No, no! Get up!

412
00:31:35,177 --> 00:31:36,220
Get some!

413
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,015
Move! Get out of the corner!

414
00:31:40,182 --> 00:31:43,560
Midas! Midas! Midas!

415
00:31:45,312 --> 00:31:48,857
Somebody's ready
to serve up a decappuccino!

416
00:31:49,024 --> 00:31:51,026
I got something for you! You ready?

417
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:56,448
Good night! That's a home run for Midas.

418
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:59,368
And so long to Noisy Boy.

419
00:32:31,525 --> 00:32:33,235
That sucked. You hungry?

420
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,072
I saved what's left
of Noisy's voice recognition board.

421
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:39,992
Other than that, he's trash.
I got to get a new robot together.

422
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,911
I need to find a mainframe. What?

423
00:32:43,078 --> 00:32:45,372
- I hate hamburgers.
- What kid hates burgers?

424
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:48,876
Fine. More for me. Here, drink this.

425
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:50,711
You never should have taken that fight.

426
00:32:50,878 --> 00:32:53,005
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.

427
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,508
Do you even think about the stuff you do
before you do it?

428
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,927
You had no idea how to fight that fight.

429
00:32:59,094 --> 00:33:02,431
Those combination codes, you didn't
know what half of them even meant.

430
00:33:02,598 --> 00:33:05,225
You threw them in there cocky
and half-assed.

431
00:33:05,392 --> 00:33:07,853
- You never gave him a chance.
- He wasn't that good.

432
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,521
Noisy Boy was a great robot.

433
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:12,441
Was. Was a great robot
back in the League, back in the day.

434
00:33:12,608 --> 00:33:16,570
But look around you. This place is
where once great robots go to die.

435
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:18,113
So throw him away.

436
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,366
That's what you do, right?
Anything you don't need you throw away.

437
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:24,620
Wow.

438
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,373
It's been a long night.

439
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,180
If you want to sleep indoors tonight,
shut up and get in the truck.

440
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,712
Don't look at me like that way.
Get in the truck!

441
00:34:02,491 --> 00:34:04,034
They gave me 400 for his head.

442
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:24,262
You stay put.
I'm going to look for parts.

443
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,432
I'm coming with you.
That drink has my heart pounding.

444
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,759
If I sit in this truck by myself,
my head will explode.

445
00:34:29,893 --> 00:34:31,353
Whatever. Just keep up.

446
00:34:42,698 --> 00:34:44,366
Crap.

447
00:34:44,533 --> 00:34:45,867
Stay back.

448
00:34:57,713 --> 00:34:59,256
All right, keep up.

449
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:03,442
These searchlights are automated,
but you got to time them right,

450
00:35:03,593 --> 00:35:04,678
so stay close.

451
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,474
It's all right.

452
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:12,019
Come on, come on.

453
00:35:13,437 --> 00:35:15,397
- We're going to get caught.
- Come on.

454
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,151
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

455
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:22,571
Quick, quick. Down in here! Go, go, go!

456
00:35:25,574 --> 00:35:28,368
Robots are on the east side.
We got to be quick in here.

457
00:35:30,746 --> 00:35:33,707
Once we're through here,
there's no more searchlights. Quick! Go!

458
00:35:50,724 --> 00:35:52,476
- Here it is.
- What are we looking for?

459
00:35:52,642 --> 00:35:55,145
Anything I could use
to put a fighting bot together.

460
00:35:55,312 --> 00:35:57,314
- Hey, look.
- What?

461
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:01,485
It's so small.

462
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:03,278
Yeah. That's before your time.

463
00:36:03,445 --> 00:36:06,531
That's a Generation One,
the very first fighting bot.

464
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:09,951
They wanted them to look like us.
The more human, the better.

465
00:36:10,118 --> 00:36:12,788
Crazy how quick everything changed.
Put that in the cart.

466
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:16,124
- What changed?
- A good question. Human boxing.

467
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:18,168
- It just faded.
- Why?

468
00:36:19,086 --> 00:36:23,632
Because the money moved on.
People wanted more carnage, more show.

469
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:26,843
You had the whole Brazilian underground,
the Gracies, the Machados,

470
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,180
jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai,
and a thousand styles in between.

471
00:36:30,347 --> 00:36:31,723
Full-on ground-and-pound.

472
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,141
- Look at this.
- What's that?

473
00:36:33,308 --> 00:36:34,476
I don't know.

474
00:36:34,643 --> 00:36:35,977
Not bad. Good spot.

475
00:36:36,853 --> 00:36:39,147
You still had human fighters,
human bodies,

476
00:36:39,314 --> 00:36:41,525
so you couldn't give the people
what they really wanted:

477
00:36:41,691 --> 00:36:43,985
true, no-holds-barred violence.

478
00:36:46,655 --> 00:36:48,824
The next logical step,

479
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:52,119
get the humans out of there
and let the machines kill each other.

480
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:54,496
Do you miss it?

481
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,501
- Boxing. Do you miss it?
- Careful.

482
00:36:59,668 --> 00:37:01,044
What? I want to know.

483
00:37:01,211 --> 00:37:03,004
Careful, you're on a cliff.

484
00:37:07,717 --> 00:37:10,595
That's a long way down.
If you fell, you'd definitely...

485
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:22,357
Charlie, help me!

486
00:37:46,548 --> 00:37:48,049
Charlie!

487
00:37:49,259 --> 00:37:52,179
- Charlie!
- Max! Max!

488
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:55,098
Max!

489
00:37:58,059 --> 00:38:01,563
- Try not to move!
- I'm on some sort of robot arm.

490
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:05,734
Wait! Just easy, easy.
Give me your hand. Nice and easy.

491
00:38:05,901 --> 00:38:10,238
Very slowly. Good. Don't look down.
Look at me. Look at me.

492
00:38:10,405 --> 00:38:14,242
That's it! I've got you!
You don't have to be soared. I got you!

493
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:16,745
- It's so far!
- It's OK. I got you.

494
00:38:16,912 --> 00:38:19,247
Give me your other hand. Nice and slow.

495
00:38:19,915 --> 00:38:24,836
Just give me your other hand very
slowly. Reach back. Come on. Reach!

496
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:27,505
Look at me.
We're going to do this together.

497
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:30,926
You and me. Just look at me. That's it.

498
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,347
One... two... three!

499
00:38:37,432 --> 00:38:42,771
That's it. I got you!
I got you. I got you. I got you.

500
00:38:49,444 --> 00:38:51,613
You're safe. You're safe.

501
00:38:55,575 --> 00:38:56,910
All right, I got you.

502
00:38:57,077 --> 00:38:58,453
- You all right?
- Yeah.

503
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,997
Come here. Easy. Easy.

504
00:39:02,832 --> 00:39:04,292
You all right?

505
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:05,794
- You all right?
- Yeah.

506
00:39:05,961 --> 00:39:07,837
I told you it was dangerous.

507
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,298
Careful. We're still on the edge here.

508
00:39:23,186 --> 00:39:26,314
Charlie, I think
there's a whole robot in there.

509
00:39:26,481 --> 00:39:27,774
So what? Let's go. Come on.

510
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,443
I'm taking him with me.
He saved my life.

511
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:33,989
He did not save your life.
I saved your life. Let's go.

512
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:37,117
Just bring the cart to the edge.
I'll use the winch to get him out.

513
00:39:37,284 --> 00:39:40,662
You want that piece of junk? You get
the cart yourself. I'm through here.

514
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,394
This is what's left of Noisy Boy?

515
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,560
That's it.

516
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,398
His head does make a nice addition
to the front of the Crash Palace.

517
00:41:33,066 --> 00:41:35,610
- It's not funny.
- Let's get a robot, you and me.

518
00:41:35,777 --> 00:41:38,905
Good idea. You're broke.
I'm almost there myself.

519
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:41,825
- You destroyed the best shot you had.
- We'll put one together.

520
00:41:41,991 --> 00:41:43,427
You're brilliant at this.
There's good stuff here.

521
00:41:43,451 --> 00:41:45,578
- There's nothing here.
- There is. Look.

522
00:41:45,745 --> 00:41:48,623
All yourjunk is... it's junk.

523
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:52,877
You're not even in the game anymore.

524
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,963
- It's all garbage.
- I heard you. It's garbage.

525
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,798
Don't get loud with me.

526
00:41:56,965 --> 00:41:58,943
- You're your problem.
- What's that supposed to mean?

527
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:01,803
I have been here for you a long time.

528
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:05,640
In the ring, out of the ring, and the
whole ugly spiral down, and I'm tired.

529
00:42:05,807 --> 00:42:09,811
My father invested everything he had
in your fight career. We loved...

530
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:16,276
He loved you like family.
And this is his home.

531
00:42:16,943 --> 00:42:19,612
I'm just trying not to let it die.
That's my plan.

532
00:42:20,989 --> 00:42:22,323
What's yours?

533
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:35,712
You're done, right?

534
00:42:35,879 --> 00:42:40,675
You're finally done?
Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.

535
00:42:41,843 --> 00:42:43,344
I got nothing left.

536
00:42:45,388 --> 00:42:46,389
All right.

537
00:42:48,892 --> 00:42:50,560
Maybe there's something here.

538
00:42:51,895 --> 00:42:55,732
This robot the kid brought in last
night. Would you look at it for me?

539
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:57,442
Please?

540
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:10,997
I've never seen anything like it before.
He's Generation Two, but barely.

541
00:43:11,164 --> 00:43:15,710
I found a power cell that fits him, and
I hooked him up to this old G-2 remote.

542
00:43:15,877 --> 00:43:18,004
You can move him around, but he's crap.

543
00:43:18,171 --> 00:43:21,049
Maybe I can get a sparring gig for him,
make a few hundred bucks.

544
00:43:21,216 --> 00:43:22,383
Stop.

545
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,135
It's my robot!

546
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:27,889
It took me half the night
dragging him out of there. He's mine.

547
00:43:28,056 --> 00:43:31,601
He's yours? Yeah. But the parts
we're putting in him are mine!

548
00:43:33,019 --> 00:43:36,356
You idiots should see if he powers up
before you fight over him.

549
00:43:36,523 --> 00:43:37,774
What happened to you?

550
00:43:56,668 --> 00:43:58,253
Watch out. Stay back.

551
00:44:16,563 --> 00:44:19,732
Looks like he's got a shadow function.
That's pretty rare.

552
00:44:20,608 --> 00:44:22,944
He can mime your movements
and store them in memory.

553
00:44:23,111 --> 00:44:25,905
- Is there anything here we could use?
- Not much.

554
00:44:26,072 --> 00:44:27,115
There's a bucket...

555
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:30,535
There's a bucket
I use to wash the truck.

556
00:44:30,702 --> 00:44:33,580
Use it and clean him up.
He smells like crap.

557
00:44:33,746 --> 00:44:36,541
Wash yourself off, too,
while you're at it. You stink.

558
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:39,877
I switched him to remote.
It's pretty basic.

559
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,422
Just use the toggles here
to steer him and walk him.

560
00:44:43,131 --> 00:44:45,925
- You play video games, right?
- Of course.

561
00:44:46,092 --> 00:44:48,803
Same idea, only this one's
a thousand-pound robot.

562
00:44:49,512 --> 00:44:50,513
Cool.

563
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,257
"Atom."

564
00:45:33,681 --> 00:45:36,976
His name is Atom.
Can we get him a fight?

565
00:45:37,143 --> 00:45:38,579
I don't think he was
ever a boxing robot.

566
00:45:38,603 --> 00:45:42,649
He's a G-2, built in early 2014.
He was a sparring bot.

567
00:45:42,815 --> 00:45:44,209
They must have built robots
like this one

568
00:45:44,233 --> 00:45:46,433
that could mirror the fighting style
of any other robot.

569
00:45:46,486 --> 00:45:48,613
OK, so can we get him a fight?

570
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,366
Are you not listening?
He's a sparring bot.

571
00:45:51,532 --> 00:45:54,261
Built to take a lot of hits, but never
dishing out any real punishment.

572
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:55,885
You could always sell him off for parts.

573
00:45:56,037 --> 00:45:59,415
- Can't you get him a fight?
- "Why can't you get him a fight?"

574
00:45:59,582 --> 00:46:01,334
God, you don't quit, do you?

575
00:46:01,501 --> 00:46:04,379
You want me to put him in some
bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?

576
00:46:04,545 --> 00:46:07,382
I saw how scared you were
at Crash Palace.

577
00:46:07,548 --> 00:46:11,719
The places that would let you fight this
robot would make you pee your pants.

578
00:46:11,886 --> 00:46:14,222
Excellent. Get him a fight.

579
00:46:20,395 --> 00:46:21,396
Stubborn kid.

580
00:46:21,562 --> 00:46:23,398
Surprise, surprise.

581
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:06,023
Let's take a walk.

582
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,178
Can you understand me?

583
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:28,272
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

584
00:48:53,506 --> 00:48:55,091
You've known Charlie a long time.

585
00:48:56,217 --> 00:48:59,554
Too long.
We both kind of grew up in this gym.

586
00:49:01,472 --> 00:49:02,849
My dad, he trained him.

587
00:49:04,225 --> 00:49:06,686
That's them. That's Charlie.

588
00:49:09,188 --> 00:49:11,107
- What was he like?
- As a boxer?

589
00:49:11,274 --> 00:49:13,526
- As anything.
- He was something.

590
00:49:13,693 --> 00:49:17,280
He was lean, tough.

591
00:49:17,446 --> 00:49:19,282
No quit, no fear.

592
00:49:23,828 --> 00:49:25,830
Come here. I want to show you something.

593
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:31,669
I have this newspaper article
from Phoenix 2007

594
00:49:31,836 --> 00:49:35,548
when Charlie fought Nico Tandy,
the top contender.

595
00:49:35,715 --> 00:49:37,091
You were at the Nico Tandy fight?

596
00:49:37,258 --> 00:49:41,220
I was. Charlie was supposed to be
a warm-up fight, an easy win.

597
00:49:41,387 --> 00:49:44,682
Nico wasn't even supposed
to break a sweat, but...

598
00:49:45,433 --> 00:49:50,271
nobody told Charlie that, so he
just kept coming and coming at him.

599
00:49:50,438 --> 00:49:51,772
Check this out.

600
00:49:54,901 --> 00:49:55,943
That's Charlie.

601
00:49:57,862 --> 00:50:00,448
First, Nico couldn't believe
the balls on this nobody.

602
00:50:00,615 --> 00:50:05,202
But Charlie kept coming,
and that's when Nico looked scared.

603
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,121
- Really?
- Really.

604
00:50:07,288 --> 00:50:08,956
He was toying with Nico.

605
00:50:09,123 --> 00:50:11,709
The top contender,
number two in the world,

606
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:13,961
and Charlie was dancing with him.

607
00:50:15,671 --> 00:50:18,716
Charlie was floating
inches off the canvas that night.

608
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:21,719
He was like a ghost.
Nico couldn't even see him.

609
00:50:23,095 --> 00:50:24,472
I could.

610
00:50:27,141 --> 00:50:28,476
He was beautiful.

611
00:50:29,644 --> 00:50:30,978
He was beautiful.

612
00:50:33,773 --> 00:50:36,567
So what happened?
Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?

613
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:40,404
No, Nico Tandy put me on my ass
in the 12th round. Twice.

614
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:42,365
Second time for good. Lights out.

615
00:50:42,531 --> 00:50:43,866
You were ahead on the scorecards

616
00:50:44,033 --> 00:50:46,160
- going into the 12th round.
- Nico Tandy rung my bell

617
00:50:46,327 --> 00:50:49,163
and went on to be the undefeated
world champ for the next three years.

618
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,332
- He knocked you out?
- Yeah. So did a lot of guys.

619
00:50:51,499 --> 00:50:52,899
You knocked a lot of guys out, too.

620
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,338
- 24 and 19. It's not exactly a career.
- But every fight a knockout.

621
00:50:57,505 --> 00:50:59,025
- Yeah.
- Win or lose, fight's not over

622
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,692
- till someone's on the mat.
- Till someone's on the mat.

623
00:51:00,716 --> 00:51:03,316
- Your old man taught me that.
- Damn straight he taught you that.

624
00:51:03,344 --> 00:51:05,513
- Who else did you fight?
- Go get your stuff together.

625
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,515
I don't need to.
Did you fight for the title?

626
00:51:07,682 --> 00:51:11,102
Yeah, you do. We leave in an hour. Go.

627
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:12,979
Wow. Here.

628
00:51:15,189 --> 00:51:16,315
Keep it.

629
00:51:17,566 --> 00:51:20,069
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

630
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,450
I like that kid.

631
00:51:27,368 --> 00:51:28,703
He likes you.

632
00:51:33,749 --> 00:51:37,169
- What I said yesterday was...
- No, nothing more to say.

633
00:51:39,046 --> 00:51:40,423
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight

634
00:51:40,589 --> 00:51:43,801
to see if I can get a partner
or raise money to get a new bot.

635
00:51:45,011 --> 00:51:48,889
That's what you wanted, right? Me gone?

636
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,396
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

637
00:52:03,904 --> 00:52:04,905
OK.

638
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:42,109
Look.

639
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,952
The champ is here. Zeus is here.

640
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:53,621
Yeah.

641
00:52:55,748 --> 00:53:01,128
<i>Zeus! No one has ever gone two rounds
with this monster. Two rounds!</i>

642
00:53:01,295 --> 00:53:04,465
<i>The champ puts his Real Steel world
championship belt on the line tonight.</i>

643
00:53:04,632 --> 00:53:06,592
<i>He just may have a real fight
on his hands.</i>

644
00:53:06,759 --> 00:53:12,098
<i>Zeus, greatest robot boxer of all time.
Ever. End of story. Good night!</i>

645
00:53:12,932 --> 00:53:15,434
- So cool. It's so cool.
- What?

646
00:53:18,604 --> 00:53:19,605
Come on.

647
00:53:22,483 --> 00:53:24,527
Listen up. I got to go find Finn.

648
00:53:24,693 --> 00:53:26,445
I want you to stay in this area.

649
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:30,574
Out of the way. Champ coming through.
Zeus coming through.

650
00:53:30,741 --> 00:53:32,243
Move, move. Champ coming through.

651
00:53:44,505 --> 00:53:47,675
Farra Lemkova, daughter behind
the father/daughter Zeus team.

652
00:53:47,842 --> 00:53:51,345
They say your father's the money
and you are the mind behind Zeus.

653
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:53,347
You're very kind,

654
00:53:53,514 --> 00:53:57,393
but I assure you, the mind behind Zeus
belongs to the great Tak Mashido.

655
00:53:58,811 --> 00:54:02,189
What did it take to lure
the reclusive genius, former boy wonder

656
00:54:02,356 --> 00:54:05,526
and arguably the most important
bot designer in the history of the sport

657
00:54:05,693 --> 00:54:07,194
out of retirement?

658
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:10,489
Why don't you ask him yourself?

659
00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:17,997
Is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?

660
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:23,586
Zeus is autonomous
and constantly evolving during a fight.

661
00:54:23,752 --> 00:54:25,754
With his adaptive operating system,

662
00:54:25,921 --> 00:54:30,885
he recognises patterns and rewrites
his fight code instantaneously.

663
00:54:32,386 --> 00:54:35,472
For myself and Joe Six-pack out there,
are you saying that Zeus...?

664
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:39,935
I'm saying that no matter
what happens in that ring...

665
00:54:40,811 --> 00:54:44,231
the result of any fight is inevitable.

666
00:54:45,399 --> 00:54:46,942
What Zeus sees...

667
00:54:48,444 --> 00:54:49,778
he kills.

668
00:54:51,322 --> 00:54:52,990
Sweet.

669
00:55:22,186 --> 00:55:23,580
I'm never going into business with you.

670
00:55:23,604 --> 00:55:24,897
I just need a break here.

671
00:55:25,064 --> 00:55:27,834
You got that old bot truck out there.
You always got something in there.

672
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:30,319
I got an old sparring bot,
ain't worth the paint left on it.

673
00:55:30,486 --> 00:55:32,071
What am I supposed to do with that?

674
00:55:32,238 --> 00:55:34,907
The Zoo. Take him to the Zoo.
They fight there tomorrow.

675
00:55:35,074 --> 00:55:37,034
Even I wouldn't be caught dead
at the Zoo.

676
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:39,036
I just need a little loan.

677
00:55:40,454 --> 00:55:41,622
What?

678
00:55:42,623 --> 00:55:44,458
- You're serious, Charlie?
- A loan.

679
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:46,794
Couple hundred. Few hundred.
Whatever you got.

680
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,338
You know I'm good for it.

681
00:55:49,505 --> 00:55:53,300
I know you, and as much
as I like you, dude...

682
00:55:54,343 --> 00:55:56,136
you're a bad bet, brother.

683
00:56:00,015 --> 00:56:01,016
Right, yeah.

684
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:23,622
Did you see that?
That's what's left of Axelrod.

685
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:25,541
Where you been? I told you to stay put.

686
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:28,002
You should have seen him.
Zeus was, like, amazing!

687
00:56:28,168 --> 00:56:30,129
- Amazing, huh?
- Unbelievable, yeah.

688
00:56:30,296 --> 00:56:34,383
He was just peppering Axelrod with
punches, but so fast. It was incredible.

689
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:38,095
Axelrod didn't even land a punch.
He didn't even survive the first round.

690
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:39,489
Is that what you think boxing is?

691
00:56:39,513 --> 00:56:41,658
Zeus beating up some piece of steel
that they feed him?

692
00:56:41,682 --> 00:56:44,518
Axelrod's not just some piece of steel.
And that is what boxing is now.

693
00:56:44,685 --> 00:56:47,229
Deal with it.
And I love it, and I'm in it now.

694
00:56:47,396 --> 00:56:50,399
You're in it now, are you?
You and your G-2 sparring bot?

695
00:56:50,566 --> 00:56:53,986
He's more than that.
If you'd get us a fight, you'd see.

696
00:56:54,153 --> 00:56:57,114
You're in luck, kid.
There's a lovely place called the Zoo.

697
00:56:57,281 --> 00:56:58,991
Tomorrow afternoon,
you'll get your fight.

698
00:56:59,158 --> 00:57:01,410
- Great.
- And it will be the end.

699
00:57:02,536 --> 00:57:04,872
I told you I hate hamburgers!

700
00:57:08,709 --> 00:57:09,877
It's a burrito!

701
00:57:18,927 --> 00:57:20,429
Right uppercut.

702
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,892
Left uppercut.

703
00:57:27,603 --> 00:57:31,440
Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.

704
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,738
Again. Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.

705
00:57:37,905 --> 00:57:40,157
You been up all night?

706
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:41,742
Yeah. I cleaned him up.

707
00:57:41,909 --> 00:57:45,245
I'm using shadow mode to program some
fight moves and sync them to the remote.

708
00:57:45,412 --> 00:57:48,624
Yeah. I saw that double-up punch
you were showing him.

709
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:51,043
That's lethal stuff.

710
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:52,378
Let's do this.

711
00:57:54,088 --> 00:57:55,464
Let's do breakfast first.

712
00:58:32,835 --> 00:58:34,835
You know you're bringing him
home in pieces, right?

713
00:58:36,964 --> 00:58:38,132
We'll see.

714
00:58:46,348 --> 00:58:49,226
- Let me deal with this.
- Charlie Kenton. This is Max.

715
00:58:49,393 --> 00:58:51,145
Kingpin. Call me Kingpin.

716
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:53,814
- All right, Kingpin, so...
- How much a round?

717
00:58:53,981 --> 00:58:55,524
We on a field trip?

718
00:58:57,818 --> 00:59:00,154
All right. He can fight my robot Metro.

719
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,298
I'll give you a hundred bucks
for one two-minute round.

720
00:59:02,322 --> 00:59:03,532
- Take it.
- Three hundred.

721
00:59:03,699 --> 00:59:07,327
One hundred. Baby boy, I'm going to
give you $100 just to get in with Metro.

722
00:59:08,287 --> 00:59:09,997
How about 500 for two rounds?

723
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:14,626
Two rounds. Son, he ain't
going to survive one round.

724
00:59:14,793 --> 00:59:17,296
- What if he does?
- He ain't.

725
00:59:17,963 --> 00:59:19,923
Let's just say he does.

726
00:59:21,884 --> 00:59:25,179
If he's still standing after one round...

727
00:59:26,221 --> 00:59:27,764
I'll give you a thousand bucks.

728
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:29,016
Shut it!

729
00:59:33,103 --> 00:59:36,440
But if he dies in there,
which he will, junior...

730
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:40,694
I get to keep what's left.

731
00:59:42,404 --> 00:59:43,697
Take the hundred.

732
00:59:44,364 --> 00:59:45,365
Deal.

733
00:59:46,325 --> 00:59:48,994
We're on. We on!

734
00:59:51,705 --> 00:59:53,373
Let's go!

735
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,852
- You should have taken the hundred.
- I got us a thousand.

736
00:59:55,876 --> 00:59:57,211
Yeah, if he wins.

737
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:24,530
You want me to drive?

738
01:00:24,696 --> 01:00:26,198
He's my bot. I got this!

739
01:00:26,365 --> 01:00:29,576
This ain't a video game.
This is for real. Right here.

740
01:00:29,743 --> 01:00:32,913
You said he's coming home in pieces.
What difference does it make?

741
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,248
All right.

742
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:37,292
I got this.

743
01:00:37,459 --> 01:00:39,711
Let's get it on! Let's get it on!

744
01:00:39,878 --> 01:00:43,507
Let's get it on like
Ping-Pong in Hong Kong!

745
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:46,343
Give me a bell! Give me a bell!

746
01:00:58,438 --> 01:01:00,774
Don't watch Atom. Watch your opponent.

747
01:01:00,941 --> 01:01:03,277
Watch out for that foot.
He's looking to pin you.

748
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:07,197
I told you to watch for that foot plant.
Come on.

749
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:10,659
Here comes the sledgehammer.

750
01:01:15,789 --> 01:01:16,957
Did you see that?

751
01:01:17,124 --> 01:01:20,377
- Come on! Get him!
- Don't yell at him, control him.

752
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:22,421
Slip right. Back step.

753
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:24,298
Duck.

754
01:01:24,464 --> 01:01:26,717
- You're welcome.
- Shut up! You're not helping!

755
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:27,926
Actually, I think I am.

756
01:01:29,469 --> 01:01:34,182
Backhand. You got speed on this guy.
Just keep moving. Bob.

757
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:42,733
Slip out of that corner.
Keep moving! Bob and weave!

758
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:46,903
That's it! Now you're listening to me.

759
01:01:56,997 --> 01:02:00,167
He can take a hit. I'll give you this.
Your bot can take a hit.

760
01:02:02,753 --> 01:02:05,231
You better slip that headlock.
This ain't gonna end well for you.

761
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:06,298
I'm trying!

762
01:02:13,013 --> 01:02:15,182
Thirty seconds!

763
01:02:16,683 --> 01:02:18,352
Thirty... Half a minute.

764
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:22,022
Half a minute! Keep moving! Just move!

765
01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:26,902
You've got 20 seconds!

766
01:02:28,362 --> 01:02:30,947
That's a thousand bucks.
Twenty seconds. Let me take over!

767
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:32,783
Move, then. Move!

768
01:02:39,915 --> 01:02:41,291
Come on.

769
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:43,377
Get up, Atom. Get up, Atom.

770
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:47,923
Count with me! Count with me! One!

771
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:51,301
- Get up!
- You know you're talking to a machine?

772
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:53,887
Four! Five! Six!

773
01:02:54,054 --> 01:02:55,472
Get up, Atom!

774
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:58,058
All the way up! All the way up!

775
01:03:00,644 --> 01:03:02,562
Yes! Yes!

776
01:03:07,067 --> 01:03:08,860
I'm going to fix it!

777
01:03:10,696 --> 01:03:12,823
I'm going to fix it! Come on, now.

778
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,592
- This thousand bucks...
- Yeah, thousand.

779
01:03:14,616 --> 01:03:16,536
Double or nothing
he can't make another round.

780
01:03:16,576 --> 01:03:18,262
- Yeah, thanks anyway.
- Deal. Double or nothing.

781
01:03:18,286 --> 01:03:20,664
Baby boy said it! We're back on! We on!

782
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,166
Are you crazy?
You threw away a thousand bucks!

783
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:25,377
He can barely stand up in there.

784
01:03:25,544 --> 01:03:28,088
Look. I really need the money.

785
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:31,508
I know. Let's work.

786
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:34,261
Jesus.

787
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:41,935
- Watch that. Watch that.
- I got that.

788
01:03:55,157 --> 01:03:57,784
- I got it.
- That's a system failure!

789
01:03:59,411 --> 01:04:01,079
- I don't got it.
- He's going down.

790
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:07,794
<i>'</i> Yes!
<i>'</i> No!

791
01:04:09,921 --> 01:04:11,506
Start the count!

792
01:04:11,673 --> 01:04:12,883
Start the count!

793
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:16,595
One! Two! Three!

794
01:04:16,762 --> 01:04:20,724
Four! Five! Six! Seven!

795
01:04:20,891 --> 01:04:22,726
Eight! Nine!

796
01:04:22,893 --> 01:04:23,894
Ten!

797
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:28,315
You did it! We did it! Wow!

798
01:04:33,987 --> 01:04:36,198
Time to go. Come on. Grab your robot.

799
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:40,911
I know, I know! I know! I know!

800
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:42,704
Kingpin, pay UP-

801
01:04:42,871 --> 01:04:45,916
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know, I know.

802
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:48,502
- We owned!
- Let's go. Come on, come on.

803
01:04:49,836 --> 01:04:51,588
- Yeah?
- Have I got a fight for you.

804
01:04:51,755 --> 01:04:56,218
Saturday night. Guaranteed four grand.
Seven if he wins.

805
01:04:56,384 --> 01:04:58,261
Four grand? You're on. Let's go!

806
01:05:07,687 --> 01:05:10,857
Bailey, it's me. He won.

807
01:05:11,983 --> 01:05:14,152
Can you believe that?
The kid's robot actually won.

808
01:05:16,029 --> 01:05:17,239
I know.

809
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:21,910
Happy? Oh, my God. Yeah.

810
01:05:22,077 --> 01:05:24,538
He's been bit. He's been bit real bad.

811
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:29,292
Anyway...

812
01:05:31,628 --> 01:05:33,338
I just wanted you to know.

813
01:06:07,289 --> 01:06:09,124
Jab, jab, hook.

814
01:06:12,794 --> 01:06:14,421
Jab, jab, hook.

815
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,009
I think you have to move your feet.

816
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:25,724
Your feet. Feet.

817
01:07:45,595 --> 01:07:47,013
Nice moves, kid.

818
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:50,642
How long you been out here?

819
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:53,061
Check it out.

820
01:07:53,228 --> 01:07:55,563
I just spent the night
doing something I think is amazing.

821
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:57,607
Incredibly amazing.
If it works, you know?

822
01:07:58,483 --> 01:08:00,652
- You know his remote was spotty?
- Yeah.

823
01:08:00,819 --> 01:08:03,989
I killed it. Got rid of it.
We don't need it anymore.

824
01:08:04,155 --> 01:08:05,281
How did you...?

825
01:08:06,032 --> 01:08:07,742
I had to start over.

826
01:08:07,909 --> 01:08:10,537
But I was able to use
the spin frame from Ambush

827
01:08:10,704 --> 01:08:13,206
and take the circuitry sleeve
out of Noisy Boy,

828
01:08:13,373 --> 01:08:14,416
and it works.

829
01:08:14,582 --> 01:08:17,711
He knows nothing, but it works.
It really, really works.

830
01:08:17,877 --> 01:08:18,920
What works?

831
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:21,798
I got to turn it on.

832
01:08:24,426 --> 01:08:25,927
Left jab, right uppercut!

833
01:08:28,054 --> 01:08:29,055
Japan!

834
01:08:29,222 --> 01:08:31,766
You put Noisy's voice recognition
into Atom?

835
01:08:31,933 --> 01:08:34,060
- Pretty smart, kid.
- Smart?

836
01:08:34,227 --> 01:08:35,520
It could be genius!

837
01:08:35,687 --> 01:08:38,499
It could be the most incredible thing
in the history of the entire world!

838
01:08:38,523 --> 01:08:41,526
Easy there, chief.
Did you drink all these sodas?

839
01:08:41,693 --> 01:08:44,738
I might have had a few.
I need you to teach him to box.

840
01:08:44,904 --> 01:08:48,908
Are you kidding me? He's not advanced
enough to handle Noisy's voice command.

841
01:08:49,075 --> 01:08:51,119
So he needs your moves. Your commands.

842
01:08:51,286 --> 01:08:53,788
- Start over from the ground up.
- Forget it.

843
01:08:53,955 --> 01:08:55,707
You were a boxer.

844
01:08:55,874 --> 01:09:00,253
Yesterday at the Zoo, you could see
things happen before they even happened.

845
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,756
I haven't boxed in a long time.
I'm not starting now.

846
01:09:02,922 --> 01:09:05,300
- Who's going to teach him to fight?
- You're doing fine.

847
01:09:05,467 --> 01:09:07,302
You don't need me. Sorry.

848
01:09:11,723 --> 01:09:13,683
That was really cool,
though, that dance.

849
01:09:14,601 --> 01:09:16,811
You should do that on Saturday night.

850
01:09:17,604 --> 01:09:19,731
- Don't make fun of me.
- I'm serious.

851
01:09:19,898 --> 01:09:22,609
Before the fight, when you guys
take the ring, you should do it.

852
01:09:22,776 --> 01:09:26,029
There's no way I'm dancing with a robot
in front of a boxing crowd.

853
01:09:26,196 --> 01:09:29,449
Are you kidding me? This is just a show.

854
01:09:29,616 --> 01:09:31,785
People want to see something
they've never seen.

855
01:09:31,951 --> 01:09:34,496
Look. You think of all the greats.

856
01:09:34,662 --> 01:09:37,415
Think Ali, Sugar Ray,
Prince Rakim, Gammer,

857
01:09:37,582 --> 01:09:39,292
they all had their nicknames.

858
01:09:39,459 --> 01:09:42,462
They had their personas.
They all had flair.

859
01:09:42,629 --> 01:09:47,050
Now you? You might not have much robot,
but with that dance, you got flair.

860
01:09:47,217 --> 01:09:50,512
Plus, you're a kid.
People love that kid thing.

861
01:09:50,678 --> 01:09:53,431
- What are you? Like nine? Ten?
- I'm 11.

862
01:09:53,598 --> 01:09:55,225
Are you sure you're 11?

863
01:09:56,267 --> 01:09:58,520
Yes. I'm sure I'm 11.

864
01:09:59,771 --> 01:10:02,941
Anyway, the point
is people want to see that.

865
01:10:06,736 --> 01:10:08,404
You're really not messing with me?

866
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:10,990
I am not messing with you.
They're going to love it.

867
01:10:14,828 --> 01:10:15,995
- Cool.
- But...

868
01:10:16,162 --> 01:10:19,165
- What?
- I won't do it unless you help me.

869
01:10:21,501 --> 01:10:23,211
I can't dance. You're on your own there.

870
01:10:23,378 --> 01:10:25,088
No. Boxing.

871
01:10:25,255 --> 01:10:26,615
- Oh, I see.
- I program the robot.

872
01:10:26,756 --> 01:10:28,925
- You teach him to box.
- And you dance.

873
01:10:29,092 --> 01:10:30,426
And you dance.

874
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:33,972
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

875
01:10:34,139 --> 01:10:35,140
Deal.

876
01:10:37,225 --> 01:10:38,309
Deal.

877
01:10:41,521 --> 01:10:42,856
It's going to be cool.

878
01:11:37,744 --> 01:11:39,120
Nice.

879
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:43,917
You're going to be punching guys bigger.
You're going to have to punch up.

880
01:11:44,626 --> 01:11:45,710
That's it.

881
01:11:46,794 --> 01:11:47,795
Nice.

882
01:11:53,426 --> 01:11:54,844
You, too, old man?

883
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:57,847
Come on. Let's get to work.

884
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:02,685
Nice! Let's do that again.

885
01:12:04,437 --> 01:12:06,522
Nice. Three-punch combo.

886
01:12:08,066 --> 01:12:09,067
Combo.

887
01:12:09,943 --> 01:12:11,778
Again. Again.

888
01:12:12,904 --> 01:12:16,324
Faster. Faster. Nice.

889
01:12:17,951 --> 01:12:20,119
You're not even out of breath.
I like it.

890
01:12:20,828 --> 01:12:22,163
Let's see how you move.

891
01:12:29,254 --> 01:12:30,255
That's good.

892
01:13:06,165 --> 01:13:08,543
Step around! Left hook! Left hook!

893
01:13:25,018 --> 01:13:26,978
That's it. Every time.

894
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:37,405
Upper out!

895
01:13:45,038 --> 01:13:46,372
Great fight, fellas.

896
01:13:54,297 --> 01:13:57,884
<i>105.5, WRUT,
the satellite home of robot boxing.</i>

897
01:13:58,051 --> 01:13:59,719
<i>Caller two, what do you got for me?</i>

898
01:13:59,886 --> 01:14:02,114
<i>Have you heard about this little bot
out there, his name is Atom?</i>

899

<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

900
01:14:03,306 --> 01:14:05,850
<i>My buddies and I saw him
the other night, and he dances.</i>

901
01:14:06,017 --> 01:14:07,894
<i>- Did you say "dances"?
- You heard me.</i>

902
01:14:08,061 --> 01:14:10,229
<i>He dances pre-fight
with this little kid,</i>

903
01:14:10,396 --> 01:14:11,915
<i>and the crowd went nuts for these two.</i>

904
01:14:11,939 --> 01:14:14,734
<i>You put the gimmick aside
for a second,</i>

<i>This bot is fast! He escapes shots

909

<i>No doubt. I'm telling you, listeners,
remember this name:</i>

910

<i>Atom. That's right, A-T-O-M.
This bot is one to watch.</i>

911
01:14:41,803 --> 01:14:44,138
- Awesome fight, sir.
- Thanks, thanks.

912
01:14:44,305 --> 01:14:46,057
Great fight.

913
01:14:46,224 --> 01:14:47,784
- You guys put on a good show.
- Thanks.

914
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,769
We'd like to invite you
to fight on our card,

915
01:14:49,936 --> 01:14:51,938
Virgin America Spectrum Detroit,
Friday night.

916
01:14:52,105 --> 01:14:55,566
Right. That's a WRB...
That's a League fight.

917
01:14:55,733 --> 01:14:59,779
Damn right it is. What do you say,
fellas? You ready for the show?

918
01:15:01,447 --> 01:15:02,782
Heck, yeah.

919
01:15:11,457 --> 01:15:14,377
It's the undercard,
but it's still a League fight.

920
01:15:15,378 --> 01:15:18,423
I just want you to be relaxed.
I want you to be relaxed.

921
01:15:18,589 --> 01:15:21,426
No freaking out.
Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.

922
01:15:21,592 --> 01:15:23,803
You go freaky-deaky,
this whole thing can go south.

923
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:27,765
Whatever you do, have fun, have fun.
You got to have fun, you understand me?

924
01:15:27,932 --> 01:15:31,894
We've come too far to get out there
and freak out and blow this whole thing.

925
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:35,440
We're going to have fun,
and we're going to not freak out!

926
01:15:35,606 --> 01:15:38,985
We're going to stay loose,
and we're just going to barn him.

927
01:15:39,152 --> 01:15:42,447
I've spent my whole life waiting
to get here. We're going to...

928
01:15:43,364 --> 01:15:46,993
I tell you what. Trust me when
I say no freaking out. You got it?

929
01:15:47,952 --> 01:15:49,954
- I got it.
- Good.

930
01:15:50,621 --> 01:15:54,876
You have been invited to Lemkova Suite.
Follow me, please.

931
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:57,545
What was that? One more time.

932
01:15:57,712 --> 01:16:00,173
Lemkova Suite. Zeus Suite.

933
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,718
Sure. Yeah. Let's head up
to the champ's suite. Sure.

934
01:16:33,372 --> 01:16:34,415
Wow.

935
01:16:34,582 --> 01:16:38,544
- Gentlemen, I'm Farra Lemkova.
- Yeah. I'm Charlie Kenton, and...

936
01:16:38,711 --> 01:16:40,713
And this, of course, is Tak Mashido.

937
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,132
Holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.

938
01:16:44,217 --> 01:16:47,428
I know you have a very important fight
tonight, so I'll get right to it.

939
01:16:47,595 --> 01:16:51,098
It's a little far from the action for
my liking. It's nice. I like it, though.

940
01:16:51,265 --> 01:16:55,144
Very nicely... Wow. That's a great shot.

941
01:16:55,311 --> 01:16:57,522
Look at that. You want an autograph?
Would you mind...?

942
01:16:57,688 --> 01:16:59,565
I'd like to buy your robot.

943
01:17:01,734 --> 01:17:06,072
He'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus.
And for that I'm willing to pay.

944
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:10,243
$200,000.

945
01:17:10,409 --> 01:17:11,869
- Done.
- He's not for sale.

946
01:17:12,036 --> 01:17:14,622
- Of course he is. We can definitely...
- He's not for sale.

947
01:17:15,414 --> 01:17:20,419
You are 15 minutes away from getting
in the ring with Twin Cities,

948
01:17:20,586 --> 01:17:22,421
a vicious League bot.

949
01:17:22,588 --> 01:17:27,843
So, to be clear, my offer stands
until the starting bell.

950
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:32,181
OK. And just to be clear,
he's not for sale!

951
01:17:32,348 --> 01:17:34,475
Not now, not ever.

952
01:17:35,726 --> 01:17:37,853
Give me a minute to clear this up, OK?

953
01:17:38,521 --> 01:17:40,856
Tak, how are you? Max!

954
01:17:43,442 --> 01:17:45,444
Be smart. I know you love him,

955
01:17:45,611 --> 01:17:48,030
but in 20 minutes
there may be nothing left to love.

956
01:17:48,197 --> 01:17:51,284
- Think about it. Take the offer.
- You think about it.

957
01:17:51,993 --> 01:17:55,621
Why does she want Atom?
Because he's different from other bots!

958
01:17:55,788 --> 01:17:57,665
Yeah, he's different.
He's smaller, weaker,

959
01:17:57,832 --> 01:17:59,992
- and he's going to get his ass kicked.
- He's a boxer.

960
01:18:00,126 --> 01:18:02,461
We taught him to box.
You taught him to box!

961
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:05,131
- That's worth something.
- I think it is, too.

962
01:18:05,298 --> 01:18:08,801
I think it's worth 200 grand.
Two hundred grand.

963
01:18:08,968 --> 01:18:11,929
We can go round and round this
all night long.

964
01:18:12,096 --> 01:18:13,389
Look at me.

965
01:18:14,682 --> 01:18:16,017
But it's not going to happen.

966
01:18:17,268 --> 01:18:18,603
I got a fight to get to.

967
01:18:33,159 --> 01:18:36,996
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight,

968
01:18:37,163 --> 01:18:41,834
<i>the march towards
the Real Steel Championship</i>

969
01:18:42,001 --> 01:18:45,046
<i>makes its way through Detroit's</i>

970
01:18:45,212 --> 01:18:49,258
Virgin America Spectrum!

971
01:18:53,262 --> 01:18:57,683
Kicking off the evening,
in our first undercard,

972
01:18:57,850 --> 01:19:00,603
the two-headed tyrant,

973
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:05,149
Twin Cities!

974
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:40,768
Opposing Twin Cities,
in his first professional fight,

975
01:19:40,935 --> 01:19:44,522
hailing from parts unknown,

976
01:19:44,689 --> 01:19:46,315
Atom!

977
01:20:41,996 --> 01:20:43,456
- Nice work, boss.
- Thanks.

978
01:20:43,622 --> 01:20:45,502
- Did you switch him to fight mode?
- Of course.

979
01:20:45,624 --> 01:20:48,294
- This bot is tough to put down.
- Atom can do it.

980
01:20:49,295 --> 01:20:52,298
Look over there. You see those geeks
with the joysticks and consoles?

981
01:20:52,465 --> 01:20:54,265
They're controlling
everything their bot does.

982
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:55,540
They're monitoring his systems,

983
01:20:55,634 --> 01:20:58,137
seeing what he sees,
stadium feeds of the fights.

984
01:20:58,304 --> 01:21:00,365
This is not like the underground
handheld remote bots

985
01:21:00,389 --> 01:21:02,451
we've been fighting.
This is the League. Stand on that.

986
01:21:02,475 --> 01:21:04,435
So what do we do?

987
01:21:05,144 --> 01:21:08,731
We fight smart, we be patient. And pray.

988
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:11,984
Seriously, pray.

989
01:21:14,612 --> 01:21:15,613
Ready!

990
01:21:16,822 --> 01:21:18,616
- Ready!
- Hands up.

991
01:21:18,783 --> 01:21:20,993
Fighters ready! Fight!

992
01:21:24,789 --> 01:21:25,915
Engage-.

993
01:21:27,291 --> 01:21:32,379
Slip! Right! Lean back.
Right, left! Cover up!

994
01:21:35,633 --> 01:21:36,926
Duck! Left roundhouse!

995
01:21:39,762 --> 01:21:41,055
Damn it.

996
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:52,066
Lean left! Lean right!
Cover up! Cover up!

997
01:21:52,233 --> 01:21:55,110
- What's going on in there?
- He's taking too many hits.

998
01:22:01,033 --> 01:22:02,284
Get your hands up!

999
01:22:05,204 --> 01:22:06,956
Get out of that corner! Move!

1000
01:22:10,042 --> 01:22:12,503
He's getting killed in there!
Tell him what to do!

1001
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:15,381
That guy's got two heads, a foot
of reach on us, and no blind spot.

1002
01:22:15,548 --> 01:22:17,383
He's got to have a weakness. Find it!

1003
01:22:23,389 --> 01:22:24,598
Wait, wait, wait.

1004
01:22:25,307 --> 01:22:28,143
Right shoulder, right shoulder,
right shoulder! He's got a tell!

1005
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:30,997
He's got a hitch in his shoulder
every time he throws that right bomb!

1006
01:22:31,021 --> 01:22:33,148
We got him!
See? Here it comes again!

1007
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:35,985
Duck! Spin!
Slide left! Roundhouse! One, two!

1008
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:39,405
Backstep. Backstep.
Backstep. Lean right.

1009
01:22:39,572 --> 01:22:41,574
Come on, Charlie! Get in there!

1010
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:44,300
Got to get in close where
he can't use that size and reach on us!

1011
01:22:44,368 --> 01:22:47,538
Left to the body! Right to the body!
Left to the body!

1012
01:22:47,705 --> 01:22:49,039
Yeah, it's working!

1013
01:22:49,206 --> 01:22:51,000
Stay downstairs! Left, right, left!

1014
01:22:52,585 --> 01:22:55,421
- These program modes aren't working.
- Left! Right hook, slip!

1015
01:22:55,588 --> 01:22:59,091
Right uppercut! Left uppercut!
Duck left. Counter right!

1016
01:22:59,258 --> 01:23:01,927
- Get him, Atom!
- Here comes the Charlie Special.

1017
01:23:02,094 --> 01:23:05,014
Three-punch combo to the body!
Out! In! Counter!

1018
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:07,057
- Two-one-two!
- Two-one-two.

1019
01:23:07,224 --> 01:23:08,684
Stay on him! Lunging right!

1020
01:23:11,604 --> 01:23:14,189
Don't let him go. Right to the body!
Straight right to the head!

1021
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:20,779
We got a systems crash!

1022
01:23:20,946 --> 01:23:22,281
Get him, Atom!

1023
01:23:25,576 --> 01:23:26,869
This is not happening, man.

1024
01:23:27,036 --> 01:23:29,288
- Put him away, Charlie!
- Spin left!

1025
01:23:30,289 --> 01:23:31,624
Spin right!

1026
01:23:33,876 --> 01:23:34,877
Finish him!

1027
01:23:35,044 --> 01:23:37,087
- Do it!
- Right uppercut!

1028
01:23:47,348 --> 01:23:48,474
He's down!

1029
01:23:49,475 --> 01:23:52,811
One! Two! Three!

1030
01:23:52,978 --> 01:23:55,814
Four! Five! Six!

1031
01:23:55,981 --> 01:23:57,900
We got him. Stay down!

1032
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:01,820
He's out! He's out!

1033
01:24:07,826 --> 01:24:08,869
Yeah!

1034
01:24:11,872 --> 01:24:13,666
Corner!

1035
01:24:13,832 --> 01:24:16,794
Corner! Corner.

1036
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:19,672
Victory!

1037
01:24:20,965 --> 01:24:25,052
In a time of one minute, 47 seconds

1038
01:24:25,219 --> 01:24:27,680
of the first round,

1039
01:24:27,846 --> 01:24:29,473
Atom has defeat...

1040
01:24:30,641 --> 01:24:33,352
I want to thank everyone
for coming out tonight!

1041
01:24:36,021 --> 01:24:40,150
Our little bot from the junkyard
got a shot at a League fight.

1042
01:24:40,317 --> 01:24:41,652
How about that?

1043
01:24:42,903 --> 01:24:47,491
And the last thing I want to say
to a special girl who won't be named,

1044
01:24:47,658 --> 01:24:49,451
Farra Lemkova.

1045
01:24:53,872 --> 01:24:57,543
That instead of buying my robot, using
your money to control this sport...

1046
01:24:57,710 --> 01:24:59,461
- That's it!
- I'm not done.

1047
01:24:59,628 --> 01:25:02,172
Why not give the littlest guy
the biggest shot?

1048
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:06,677
Because I bet if you give him a shot,
he'll surprise you!

1049
01:25:06,844 --> 01:25:08,324
Wouldn't you like to see a little guy

1050
01:25:08,429 --> 01:25:10,431
get a shot at the
Real Steel Championship?

1051
01:25:14,518 --> 01:25:17,980
I challenge Zeus to a fight.

1052
01:25:20,065 --> 01:25:24,069
Any time, any place, anywhere!

1053
01:25:24,236 --> 01:25:27,197
You name it! We will be there!

1054
01:25:34,997 --> 01:25:36,915
I'm going to get us that fight!

1055
01:25:40,836 --> 01:25:43,839
Atom, Atom, Atom...

1056
01:25:56,769 --> 01:25:59,021
That was a ballsy move,
you challenging Zeus like that.

1057
01:25:59,188 --> 01:26:00,522
That's one thing to call it.

1058
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:02,249
A lot of people would like to see that.

1059
01:26:02,274 --> 01:26:05,110
- You're damn right they would.
- You listening to this kid? Jeez!

1060
01:26:05,277 --> 01:26:07,112
- Good fight, fellas.
- Thanks, man.

1061
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:09,073
- Look at this. Let's celebrate.
- Yeah.

1062
01:26:09,239 --> 01:26:12,326
- All right, 70-30, right?
- Yeah, 70 for me and 30 for you.

1063
01:26:12,493 --> 01:26:14,119
- That's so right.
- That's very funny.

1064
01:26:14,286 --> 01:26:18,290
- I told you we shouldn't have sold him.
- OK. No, no, no.

1065
01:26:18,457 --> 01:26:22,628
I remember now. Who's right?
Say who's right. Say "Max is right."

1066
01:26:22,795 --> 01:26:24,713
All right, all right. All right.

1067
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,383
- We're a good team.
- No, no. Max is right.

1068
01:26:28,717 --> 01:26:31,011
That was unbelievable.
Thank you, Twin Cities.

1069
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:34,932
- We set?
- Yeah.

1070
01:26:35,099 --> 01:26:37,267
- Let's do it.
- Charlie boy.

1071
01:26:38,268 --> 01:26:41,563
- Ricky, I was just going to call you.
- Oh, yeah.

1072
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:44,525
I actually really was going to call you.

1073
01:26:44,733 --> 01:26:46,485
Don't worry about that.

1074
01:26:46,652 --> 01:26:48,654
That was a heck of a fight.

1075
01:26:48,821 --> 01:26:51,115
Congratulations to both of you.
That was good.

1076
01:26:51,281 --> 01:26:54,076
It was an amazing fight.
That was a great job, young man.

1077
01:26:55,077 --> 01:26:56,411
- Come on, man.
- What?

1078
01:26:56,578 --> 01:27:00,666
- You serious?
- You thought I was joking

1079
01:27:00,833 --> 01:27:02,769
when I said I'd beat you
within an inch of your life?

1080
01:27:02,793 --> 01:27:05,838
He thought that was a joke.
It wasn't a joke.

1081
01:27:06,004 --> 01:27:10,175
I got a kid here. And I have your money.
We don't have a problem.

1082
01:27:10,342 --> 01:27:13,011
I'm sure you do,

1083
01:27:13,178 --> 01:27:16,181
but I think we know it's about
much more than money, don't we?

1084
01:27:16,348 --> 01:27:21,520
All right. What do you want?
You want 25, 30? You want 30 grand?

1085
01:27:21,687 --> 01:27:23,487
- I got the money in cash here.
- Yeah, right.

1086
01:27:23,522 --> 01:27:26,650
Let's go! Max, go! Go, go! Run!

1087
01:27:26,817 --> 01:27:30,154
- Run! Come on. Keep up, keep up!
- Get him now!

1088
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,572
Run! Come on!

1089
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:35,200
Get off him! Get off him!

1090
01:27:38,537 --> 01:27:39,538
Come here!

1091
01:27:44,001 --> 01:27:45,043
Hey, Ricky.

1092
01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:46,770
That's his money!
Leave him out of this!

1093
01:27:59,224 --> 01:28:01,143
Stop!

1094
01:28:03,562 --> 01:28:04,897
Stop!

1095
01:28:05,063 --> 01:28:08,567
Take all his money. Take it all.

1096
01:28:11,236 --> 01:28:13,614
Your friend's a real dirtbag, kid.

1097
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:15,365
He's my father!

1098
01:28:17,576 --> 01:28:22,289
Well. Looks like a little less
than an inch of your life.

1099
01:28:22,456 --> 01:28:25,250
Well, buddy, that will teach him.

1100
01:28:30,839 --> 01:28:33,759
Just like old times, Charlie boy!

1101
01:28:33,926 --> 01:28:35,177
Let's go, boys.

1102
01:29:01,036 --> 01:29:05,290
I'm sorry, Max. I'm sorry. Sorry.

1103
01:29:45,831 --> 01:29:47,624
- What are we doing here?
- Max, just...

1104
01:29:47,791 --> 01:29:50,836
Is it Farra? She called you, didn't she?
We're going to get the Zeus fight.

1105
01:29:51,003 --> 01:29:55,173
It's not the Zeus people. I've been
thinking about all this, and...

1106
01:29:57,259 --> 01:29:58,343
Max!

1107
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:09,771
It's so good to see you.

1108
01:30:09,938 --> 01:30:12,418
- What is she doing here?
- It's better if you go with her now.

1109
01:30:12,566 --> 01:30:14,651
We get beat up,
so you call her to come and get me?

1110
01:30:14,818 --> 01:30:16,754
He's been beat up. I told you
he couldn't take care of him!

1111
01:30:16,778 --> 01:30:19,531
Yeah. I called her.
Look at us. We're a mess.

1112
01:30:19,698 --> 01:30:21,700
We're fine. She can leave!

1113
01:30:21,867 --> 01:30:24,870
Atom's fighting good.
We can make the money back.

1114
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,497
Charlie, please.

1115
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:29,624
Just...

1116
01:30:32,544 --> 01:30:35,088
Charlie, we're doing so good.

1117
01:30:37,049 --> 01:30:38,967
Charlie, please, no.

1118
01:30:40,385 --> 01:30:42,888
Don't. Don't. Don't.

1119
01:30:43,930 --> 01:30:46,850
Please. Please.

1120
01:30:51,438 --> 01:30:54,566
Trust me, kid.
It's better this way, all right?

1121
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:58,153
I know you think you know
what's right, but you don't.

1122
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,905
You're too young. You don't know.

1123
01:31:00,072 --> 01:31:01,573
Look at me, trust me.

1124
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:05,035
And legally she has custody,
so what can I do?

1125
01:31:05,994 --> 01:31:07,746
What can I do?

1126
01:31:23,095 --> 01:31:24,721
I don't want your money, Marvin.

1127
01:31:25,889 --> 01:31:27,933
Max, we have our own swimming pool

1128
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:32,687
and we have a hot tub and a lot
of super fun toys to play with.

1129
01:31:32,854 --> 01:31:35,524
Do you want to play with them?
It's going to be fun.

1130
01:31:36,441 --> 01:31:37,776
What's going on?

1131
01:31:37,943 --> 01:31:40,612
He won't even talk to me,
so thanks for that, Charlie.

1132
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,240
I'm going to wait in the car.

1133
01:31:45,867 --> 01:31:48,453
You don't want to talk, fine. I'll talk.

1134
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:50,497
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?

1135
01:31:50,664 --> 01:31:53,708
You knew from day one what this was.

1136
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:55,669
You decided to take the ride.

1137
01:31:56,336 --> 01:32:00,132
You thought me, you,
and a little robot from the junk heap

1138
01:32:00,298 --> 01:32:02,717
were going to ride off into the sunset?

1139
01:32:04,803 --> 01:32:07,305
No, you forgot who I was!

1140
01:32:13,437 --> 01:32:14,729
You deserve better...

1141
01:32:16,314 --> 01:32:17,357
than me.

1142
01:32:21,862 --> 01:32:23,613
Will you say something, please?

1143
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:26,241
I tried. What do you want from me?

1144
01:32:26,408 --> 01:32:28,118
I want you to fight for me.

1145
01:32:29,369 --> 01:32:31,163
That's all I ever wanted.

1146
01:34:36,413 --> 01:34:37,747
Don't ask.

1147
01:34:39,874 --> 01:34:41,418
So no Max.

1148
01:34:42,669 --> 01:34:46,423
It's better this way.
Marv and Debra have money. Max is set.

1149
01:34:46,590 --> 01:34:48,300
Did you not see the way
he looked at you?

1150
01:34:49,593 --> 01:34:51,678
That's the way I looked at my dad.

1151
01:34:51,845 --> 01:34:54,097
Even now I would give anything
to have that back.

1152
01:34:54,264 --> 01:34:58,310
Your dad was special.
He was in your corner from day one.

1153
01:34:59,311 --> 01:35:00,937
Me, come on. I blew it.

1154
01:35:02,897 --> 01:35:04,316
I blew it.

1155
01:35:05,233 --> 01:35:07,152
When Max was born I just...

1156
01:35:07,819 --> 01:35:09,237
freaked out.

1157
01:35:09,404 --> 01:35:11,656
But something
would have been better than nothing.

1158
01:35:11,823 --> 01:35:13,074
I wouldn't know where to start.

1159
01:35:13,241 --> 01:35:14,284
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't.

1160
01:35:14,451 --> 01:35:15,910
- You do.
- No.

1161
01:35:16,953 --> 01:35:17,996
You do.

1162
01:35:50,987 --> 01:35:52,030
<i>L</i> got to g0-

1163
01:35:55,158 --> 01:35:56,701
Twelve hundred miles for a kiss.

1164
01:35:58,203 --> 01:36:00,580
Worth it. Worth it.

1165
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:13,593
Go get him, Charlie.

1166
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:18,390
You sound like your dad.

1167
01:36:46,751 --> 01:36:50,463
Look, I know you think I abandoned you,

1168
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:53,425
and I guess I did originally.

1169
01:36:53,591 --> 01:36:54,592
Then you sold me.

1170
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:56,428
Charlie.

1171
01:36:57,512 --> 01:36:59,431
You have no business being here.

1172
01:36:59,597 --> 01:37:02,016
That's true.
You've got full custody. He's yours.

1173
01:37:02,183 --> 01:37:06,104
And I know I've done all kinds of wrong
by this kid, but if you'll let me...

1174
01:37:08,231 --> 01:37:10,233
I'd just like to do one thing right.

1175
01:37:13,194 --> 01:37:14,279
Right.

1176
01:37:15,905 --> 01:37:17,615
- Where were we?
- You sold me.

1177
01:37:17,782 --> 01:37:19,909
Right, yeah, that happened.

1178
01:37:20,076 --> 01:37:22,287
- Wait, what?
- Then we had our asses kicked.

1179
01:37:22,454 --> 01:37:24,622
And you slept on a shelf in a truck,
and it was awful.

1180
01:37:24,789 --> 01:37:26,416
- And dangerous.
- Really dangerous.

1181
01:37:26,583 --> 01:37:30,336
I mean, I know. God. I'm sorry.

1182
01:37:31,463 --> 01:37:34,466
That's why you came?
To say you're sorry?

1183
01:37:34,632 --> 01:37:36,968
No. I mean, yes. Yes.

1184
01:37:39,971 --> 01:37:43,641
But no. No, I came to tell you
that I heard you.

1185
01:37:44,642 --> 01:37:47,979
I got it.
I'm a little slow, but I got it.

1186
01:37:49,564 --> 01:37:53,026
I know you had a bum ride, and I
wasn't there and I should have been.

1187
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:55,445
I should have been.

1188
01:37:56,696 --> 01:37:58,072
Your mom was...

1189
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:00,492
She was cool, wasn't she?

1190
01:38:02,035 --> 01:38:03,119
She was.

1191
01:38:03,995 --> 01:38:05,330
She was the coolest.

1192
01:38:06,164 --> 01:38:08,750
Yeah, she was.

1193
01:38:11,669 --> 01:38:16,633
And I'm sorry about...
what happened with her.

1194
01:38:19,886 --> 01:38:22,680
And I can't get those years back, Max,

1195
01:38:22,847 --> 01:38:25,892
but I'm here right now...

1196
01:38:27,393 --> 01:38:30,688
and if you're up for it,
I'm ready to fight.

1197
01:38:44,702 --> 01:38:46,287
We got the Zeus fight.

1198
01:38:46,454 --> 01:38:47,664
What?

1199
01:38:47,831 --> 01:38:49,624
No, no, we didn't.

1200
01:38:50,542 --> 01:38:52,544
You got the Zeus fight.

1201
01:38:56,506 --> 01:38:58,383
So what do you say, Debra?

1202
01:38:58,550 --> 01:38:59,926
Can we do this one last thing?

1203
01:39:03,429 --> 01:39:05,932
- One night.
- It's all we need. Thank you.

1204
01:39:11,062 --> 01:39:14,774
We'll probably get our asses kicked,
but at least we'll go down swinging.

1205
01:39:15,692 --> 01:39:17,777
Yeah? What do you say?

1206
01:39:19,946 --> 01:39:24,367
<i>Welcome to New York's Bing Arena
and the Real Steel Championship Bout.</i>

1207
01:39:24,534 --> 01:39:26,870
<i>Tim, it's the fight
we never thought we'd see.</i>

1208
01:39:27,036 --> 01:39:29,247
<i>Zeus, the undefeated WRB champion,</i>

1209
01:39:29,414 --> 01:39:32,709
<i>against the underdog, rising star Atom.</i>

1210
01:39:32,876 --> 01:39:34,711
<i>The champ's handlers
have agreed to fight</i>

1211
01:39:34,878 --> 01:39:37,422
<i>outside the circle
of well-known League bots,</i>

1212
01:39:37,589 --> 01:39:41,718
<i>and have decided to give the people
a true David versus Goliath spectacle.</i>

1213
01:39:41,885 --> 01:39:45,263
Now, Tim, help me out on this.
Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?

1214
01:39:45,430 --> 01:39:47,098
The greatest robot boxer of all time

1215
01:39:47,265 --> 01:39:50,184
gives a shot at the belt
to a G-2 named Atom?

1216
01:39:50,351 --> 01:39:54,272
Well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido,
Team Zeus has lost their minds.

1217
01:39:54,439 --> 01:39:56,691
Now, he may look cool
as he enters the arena,

1218
01:39:56,858 --> 01:39:59,861
but he has made no bones
about his disdain for this matchup.

1219
01:40:00,028 --> 01:40:02,780
Our cameras tried to catch up
with him earlier this week.

1220
01:40:02,947 --> 01:40:05,950
Look at this clip. Mashido wouldn't
even stop to talk to the press,

1221
01:40:06,117 --> 01:40:09,287
<i>referring only to this fight
as an insult to his creation.</i>

1222
01:40:09,454 --> 01:40:13,249
Now, Max Kenton, Atom's trainer,
did more than just challenge Zeus.

1223
01:40:13,416 --> 01:40:14,626
He did so publicly.

1224
01:40:14,792 --> 01:40:18,379
The challenge went viral and created
a PR nightmare for the champ.

1225
01:40:18,546 --> 01:40:22,133
No argument there. And I think the Zeus
camp knows exactly what they're doing.

1226
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:23,801
That they do. Come on.

1227
01:40:23,968 --> 01:40:26,971
Giving a shot at the belt
to a nobody from nowhere.

1228
01:40:27,138 --> 01:40:30,183
This "junkyard dog," if you will.
That's a marketing stunt.

1229
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:33,102
And judging from this crowd,
that stunt is working.

1230
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:48,826
We can't win, can we?

1231
01:40:49,953 --> 01:40:50,995
We'll see.

1232
01:40:55,291 --> 01:40:57,502
As the challenger
makes his way into the arena,

1233
01:40:57,669 --> 01:40:59,837
you can hear the surge of excitement.

1234
01:41:11,265 --> 01:41:14,644
Atom has arrived
onto the WRB scene with a vengeance,

1235
01:41:14,811 --> 01:41:17,522
using a style,
some would call it human-like,

1236
01:41:17,689 --> 01:41:20,108
that bot fighting has rarely seen.

1237
01:41:20,274 --> 01:41:22,527
Atom and his pint-size trainer
step into the ring

1238
01:41:22,694 --> 01:41:25,446
and the look on
Farra Lemkova's face says it all.

1239
01:41:25,613 --> 01:41:27,824
Welcome to the bigs, junior!

1240
01:41:27,991 --> 01:41:30,831
I'm giving one-to-five odds that Atom
don't make it out the first round.

1241
01:41:30,868 --> 01:41:32,203
Who wants some?

1242
01:41:33,037 --> 01:41:34,622
I'll take some of that action.

1243
01:41:34,789 --> 01:41:38,001
Hey, there!
I'll take some of that action.

1244
01:41:39,210 --> 01:41:42,213
How's it going... partner?

1245
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:43,840
Partner?

1246
01:41:44,298 --> 01:41:47,468
That's great. How about a hundred K?
Is that funny?

1247
01:41:47,635 --> 01:41:50,221
Hundred K says Atom
doesn't see round two.

1248
01:41:50,388 --> 01:41:52,098
You carrying around
that kind of scratch?

1249
01:41:53,516 --> 01:41:55,727
- Yeah.
- Hundred K?

1250
01:41:56,394 --> 01:42:00,565
Tell you what.
Remember section 101, row C,

1251
01:42:00,732 --> 01:42:03,401
and you can bring me
my money right to my seat.

1252
01:42:03,568 --> 01:42:07,030
101, row C? Hundred K?

1253
01:42:07,739 --> 01:42:09,073
You heard me, homey.

1254
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:10,992
- Homey?
- Right?

1255
01:42:11,159 --> 01:42:12,368
Homeboy!

1256
01:42:13,578 --> 01:42:15,955
All right. Peace out, posse.

1257
01:42:16,122 --> 01:42:17,457
Come on, sugar. Let's go.

1258
01:42:41,272 --> 01:42:43,983
- Never beaten.
- It's showtime!

1259
01:42:44,150 --> 01:42:46,277
Never threatened.

1260
01:42:46,444 --> 01:42:49,614
The king of the ring,

1261
01:42:49,781 --> 01:42:51,866
the ruler of robots!

1262
01:42:53,117 --> 01:42:58,289
Bow down to the mighty Zeus!

1263
01:43:24,065 --> 01:43:25,066
Oh, shit!

1264
01:43:31,614 --> 01:43:32,907
That was awesome.

1265
01:43:39,539 --> 01:43:40,706
Come on, let's go.

1266
01:43:47,505 --> 01:43:50,174
Ladies and gentlemen,

1267
01:43:50,341 --> 01:43:52,927
in a bout scheduled for five rounds

1268
01:43:53,094 --> 01:43:56,347
for the World Robot
Boxing Championship,

1269
01:43:56,514 --> 01:44:01,060
in the corner to my right,
the challenger, Atom!

1270
01:44:01,227 --> 01:44:02,353
Showboat!

1271
01:44:06,357 --> 01:44:08,818
And in the corner to my left,

1272
01:44:08,985 --> 01:44:11,988
the undeniable champion
of this universe

1273
01:44:12,155 --> 01:44:15,575
and any other universe known
or unknown,

1274
01:44:15,741 --> 01:44:20,037
the mighty Zeus!

1275
01:44:24,542 --> 01:44:28,713
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready

1276
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:33,885
for Real Steel!

1277
01:44:36,846 --> 01:44:38,014
This is what it's all about!

1278
01:44:38,181 --> 01:44:42,101
There's the starting bell
and we are underway.

1279
01:44:42,268 --> 01:44:44,145
The bots emerge from their corners.

1280
01:44:45,062 --> 01:44:48,107
Zeus decks Atom, and he is already down.

1281
01:44:48,274 --> 01:44:49,400
On your feet!

1282
01:44:49,567 --> 01:44:52,111
Looks like we are in
for another Zeus clinic.

1283
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:56,949
Referee Matt Geiger
coming in the ring to start the count.

1284
01:44:58,075 --> 01:44:59,118
Get up!

1285
01:45:00,703 --> 01:45:02,914
Push up! Stand up!

1286
01:45:03,998 --> 01:45:06,459
But look at this.
The little bot's back on his feet

1287
01:45:06,626 --> 01:45:09,212
to get a second blistering attack
from Zeus!

1288
01:45:09,378 --> 01:45:12,298
Atom is down for the second time
in less than ten seconds.

1289
01:45:12,465 --> 01:45:16,427
- He's too strong!
- That's my boy right there!

1290
01:45:18,429 --> 01:45:20,097
Get up and get in the game!

1291
01:45:20,264 --> 01:45:23,267
Come on! No, please Atom, get up!
Please!

1292
01:45:23,434 --> 01:45:26,062
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1293
01:45:27,605 --> 01:45:31,108
Once again,
the challenger finds his feet!

1294
01:45:31,609 --> 01:45:32,610
Lean back!

1295
01:45:32,777 --> 01:45:35,112
Atom's getting pummelled into the corner!

1296
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:37,448
- Get out of there!
- Move!

1297
01:45:39,825 --> 01:45:41,869
A demolishing inside shot.

1298
01:45:42,036 --> 01:45:43,162
Get your hands up!

1299
01:45:45,248 --> 01:45:46,624
Hands up!

1300
01:45:47,625 --> 01:45:49,126
Crush that little can!

1301
01:45:49,293 --> 01:45:50,628
Get out of the corner!

1302
01:45:50,795 --> 01:45:54,131
Kenton desperately trying to command
his robot out of that suicide corner.

1303
01:45:59,053 --> 01:46:00,137
Get your feet under you!

1304
01:46:01,764 --> 01:46:03,808
Good night, sparring bot!

1305
01:46:03,975 --> 01:46:06,560
It might have taken Zeus a bit longer,
but he's done it again!

1306
01:46:06,727 --> 01:46:10,147
Atom is down for the third
and possibly final time tonight.

1307
01:46:10,314 --> 01:46:12,483
<i>_</i> Stand up!
" Two!

1308
01:46:12,650 --> 01:46:14,068
Three!

1309
01:46:14,235 --> 01:46:15,403
Atom, get UP!

1310
01:46:15,569 --> 01:46:17,655
- Get up, Atom.
- Get up, Atom.

1311
01:46:18,322 --> 01:46:21,075
- Six! Seven!
- Get up!

1312
01:46:21,242 --> 01:46:23,077
Eight! Nine!

1313
01:46:24,161 --> 01:46:28,541
I don't believe this! Against all odds,
this little bot is on his feet again.

1314
01:46:29,834 --> 01:46:30,876
Come on, Atom!

1315
01:46:34,088 --> 01:46:35,256
He can't survive this!

1316
01:46:39,051 --> 01:46:41,304
- Come on, Charlie!
- Right uppercut!

1317
01:46:42,596 --> 01:46:45,349
Atom has landed a punch!

1318
01:46:45,516 --> 01:46:50,521
Zeus is stunned as he reels back from
an uppercut that he never saw coming!

1319
01:46:50,688 --> 01:46:52,189
Advance!

1320
01:46:52,356 --> 01:46:53,691
Fade back, counter right!

1321
01:46:54,442 --> 01:46:55,609
Fade back, counter right!

1322
01:46:56,444 --> 01:47:00,865
Right cross! Right cross!
Right cross! Left hook!

1323
01:47:01,032 --> 01:47:03,909
- Let's go! Come on!
- Take him down!

1324
01:47:04,535 --> 01:47:06,579
For the first time in his dominant run,

1325
01:47:06,746 --> 01:47:10,541
Zeus has met a bot
who simply won't back down!

1326
01:47:12,376 --> 01:47:15,129
The crowd is going nuts!
Zeus gives it everything he's got

1327
01:47:15,296 --> 01:47:18,215
as we reach the last 15 seconds
of round one!

1328
01:47:18,382 --> 01:47:22,345
Zeus corners Atom,
going double duty with both fists!

1329
01:47:22,511 --> 01:47:25,431
Downtown, uptown,
as the clock winds down!

1330
01:47:25,598 --> 01:47:28,642
- Hands up, chin down.
- Stay low, stay low!

1331
01:47:32,355 --> 01:47:37,401
Only five seconds left, as here comes
that piston-packed right of the champ!

1332
01:47:38,819 --> 01:47:43,032
There's the bell! I don't believe it.
Somehow Atom has survived.

1333
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:48,245
We will have a second round.
And the crowd here is thrilled!

1334
01:47:51,415 --> 01:47:54,502
He made it! Yeah! Corner!

1335
01:47:56,128 --> 01:47:59,924
We got to get out of here.
We got to get out of here now!

1336
01:48:02,718 --> 01:48:05,012
We got to go this way. Come on!

1337
01:48:10,518 --> 01:48:11,852
OK, you sit down.

1338
01:48:15,106 --> 01:48:17,691
- Let's go, homey.
- All right.

1339
01:48:17,858 --> 01:48:19,402
I'll be back for you, baby.

1340
01:48:20,361 --> 01:48:22,530
Get your hands off me!

1341
01:48:25,074 --> 01:48:27,952
Both corners furiously working
on their bots.

1342
01:48:28,119 --> 01:48:31,455
This crowd came here tonight
expecting a massacre,

1343
01:48:31,622 --> 01:48:33,624
but instead they're getting a war!

1344
01:48:33,791 --> 01:48:35,126
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1345
01:48:35,292 --> 01:48:36,293
All right. Here we go.

1346
01:48:36,460 --> 01:48:38,546
What is happening?

1347
01:48:38,712 --> 01:48:43,676
He is fully prepared for all possible
contingencies. He will be fine.

1348
01:48:43,843 --> 01:48:45,177
What next?

1349
01:48:46,095 --> 01:48:47,430
Round two.

1350
01:48:55,604 --> 01:48:58,899
Round two kicks off,
and incredibly the challenger, Atom,

1351
01:48:59,066 --> 01:49:01,068
is giving the champ a run for his money.

1352
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:06,490
Zeus tosses the smaller bot
across the ring like a tin can!

1353
01:49:10,286 --> 01:49:15,207
Kenton working his bot with a trifecta
of straight rights to the champ's dome!

1354
01:49:20,337 --> 01:49:24,300
Toe-to-toe they stand,
trading deafening blows!

1355
01:49:27,386 --> 01:49:31,056
Whatever strategy either corner
had cooked up has been destroyed!

1356
01:49:33,893 --> 01:49:37,313
Metal bashing metal.
Steel smashing steel.

1357
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:39,690
This is a brawl!

1358
01:49:42,443 --> 01:49:47,323
The crowd is on their feet, watching two
machines driven to kill each other!

1359
01:49:47,490 --> 01:49:50,034
Something has to give, and it does!

1360
01:49:50,201 --> 01:49:51,994
Atom goes down again!

1361
01:49:52,161 --> 01:49:56,248
Lights out for the junkyard dog who put
on a heck of a show here tonight!

1362
01:49:58,417 --> 01:50:00,961
And yet again, Atom rises up.

1363
01:50:01,128 --> 01:50:05,591
Kenton must have hardwired
this bot with the will to go on!

1364
01:50:12,056 --> 01:50:17,061
Midway through round four, and Zeus
is looking to end this thing right now.

1365
01:50:17,228 --> 01:50:21,565
The champ is holding nothing back
as he cracks open the hurt locker!

1366
01:50:31,742 --> 01:50:35,579
Atom is stumbling around the ring,
apparently disoriented and dazed!

1367
01:50:35,746 --> 01:50:37,206
- Hands up!
- What's going on?

1368
01:50:37,373 --> 01:50:40,251
I think the voice recog is shot!
He's not responding!

1369
01:50:43,587 --> 01:50:48,259
Zeus has found yet another gear of
violence, drilling Atom's midsection.

1370
01:50:48,425 --> 01:50:51,595
No! Stop! Do something!

1371
01:50:51,762 --> 01:50:52,763
He can't hear me!

1372
01:50:54,265 --> 01:50:59,770
But the bell sounds, and once again
this little robot has stunned the world!

1373
01:51:01,939 --> 01:51:06,402
We're done, Max! He can't hear me.
This is murder. We've had enough.

1374
01:51:06,569 --> 01:51:08,946
- I'm disabling the voice recognition.
- He can't hear me!

1375
01:51:09,113 --> 01:51:11,490
- Yes, but he can see you!
- What?

1376
01:51:12,908 --> 01:51:15,703
I'm putting him in shadow mode.
Show him what to do.

1377
01:51:15,869 --> 01:51:18,289
Without the voice recognition,
he'll move even faster!

1378
01:51:18,455 --> 01:51:19,623
No way. No way!

1379
01:51:19,790 --> 01:51:21,709
Look at them. They are freaking out!

1380
01:51:22,376 --> 01:51:24,461
Rich girl is ripping him
a new one over there!

1381
01:51:24,628 --> 01:51:26,630
Do you know why?
Because they're scared.

1382
01:51:26,797 --> 01:51:28,966
Because Atom can do things
no other bot has ever done.

1383
01:51:29,133 --> 01:51:30,926
- But I can't do it!
- Yes, you can.

1384
01:51:31,093 --> 01:51:33,804
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1385
01:51:34,972 --> 01:51:38,517
Show him what to do.
You have to fight the last round.

1386
01:51:38,684 --> 01:51:40,144
Don't ask me. Don't.

1387
01:51:40,311 --> 01:51:44,732
Charlie... please. I beg you.

1388
01:51:53,574 --> 01:51:54,974
Are you kidding me with those eyes?

1389
01:51:56,827 --> 01:51:58,329
Damn it!

1390
01:51:58,495 --> 01:51:59,538
Yes!

1391
01:52:00,289 --> 01:52:01,832
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1392
01:52:02,916 --> 01:52:05,478
I know you're in there! I'm not sure
if you're getting this or what,

1393
01:52:05,502 --> 01:52:06,754
but I know you're in there!

1394
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:09,214
- Kenton. In or out?
- In. Give me a minute.

1395
01:52:12,801 --> 01:52:17,473
I know you can't hear me,
but you can see me, so watch me!

1396
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:20,184
Watch... me.

1397
01:52:20,351 --> 01:52:23,854
- You know you're talking to a robot.
- I know. Shut up.

1398
01:52:25,022 --> 01:52:26,732
Watch me.

1399
01:52:27,066 --> 01:52:29,026
An epic battle being waged here tonight,

1400
01:52:29,193 --> 01:52:31,278
as the fifth and final round
gets underway.

1401
01:52:31,445 --> 01:52:32,988
Come on, Atom!

1402
01:52:42,623 --> 01:52:44,875
Wait a second. Are you seeing this?

1403
01:52:45,042 --> 01:52:48,128
Charlie Kenton is shadowboxing
just outside the ring!

1404
01:52:48,295 --> 01:52:50,547
It looks like Atom
has a shadow function.

1405
01:52:50,714 --> 01:52:53,467
So, basically,
that means Charlie Kenton

1406
01:52:53,634 --> 01:52:56,428
is fighting the last round
of this fight against Zeus.

1407
01:52:56,595 --> 01:53:01,058
It doesn't seem to help, because Atom
is backed up against the ropes again.

1408
01:53:03,143 --> 01:53:04,978
Help him! Fight back!

1409
01:53:05,145 --> 01:53:06,230
Not yet.

1410
01:53:09,775 --> 01:53:13,654
Tak Mashido supervising personally
as Zeus hammers down,

1411
01:53:13,821 --> 01:53:16,740
furiously trying to end this thing
once and for all.

1412
01:53:17,741 --> 01:53:20,744
I got to tell you, folks,
the champ looks tired.

1413
01:53:20,911 --> 01:53:23,205
This robot seems to be running on empty.

1414
01:53:27,042 --> 01:53:29,420
I don't believe it.
Atom is taunting Zeus.

1415
01:53:29,586 --> 01:53:33,090
- Switch to turbo!
- He's actually asking for more.

1416
01:53:35,092 --> 01:53:36,677
Please do something!

1417
01:53:36,844 --> 01:53:39,096
- Not yet.
- That's right, Charlie. Not yet.

1418
01:53:41,890 --> 01:53:43,267
Nitrous pistons, now!

1419
01:53:46,478 --> 01:53:48,439
He's not going to last much longer!

1420
01:53:48,605 --> 01:53:50,441
- Fight back!
- Not yet.

1421
01:53:51,191 --> 01:53:52,484
Hang in there!

1422
01:53:52,651 --> 01:53:57,948
Atom is riddled with the nitrous-fuelled
Gatling guns of Zeus's blows!

1423
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:02,953
Atom! Atom! Atom! Atom!

1424
01:54:06,373 --> 01:54:08,500
Wait him out, wait him out! Not yet!

1425
01:54:11,086 --> 01:54:13,130
Zeus is slowing down!

1426
01:54:13,297 --> 01:54:16,133
The champ's power core
is clearly depleted.

1427
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:17,301
Charlie, please!

1428
01:54:19,636 --> 01:54:20,763
Hey, kid.

1429
01:54:21,638 --> 01:54:23,056
- Now.
- Now!

1430
01:54:28,479 --> 01:54:29,480
Get in there!

1431
01:54:31,982 --> 01:54:34,318
Knock that little bitch! Bust him open!

1432
01:54:43,285 --> 01:54:44,661
Yeah! That's right!

1433
01:54:46,163 --> 01:54:47,414
Do something!

1434
01:54:48,332 --> 01:54:49,333
Move!

1435
01:54:50,834 --> 01:54:53,170
Override. Switching to manual.

1436
01:54:55,255 --> 01:55:00,010
In a shocking move, Tak Mashido is
manually operating his robot personally!

1437
01:55:10,646 --> 01:55:13,190
- Work the body! Get inside him!
- Get him, Atom!

1438
01:55:14,942 --> 01:55:19,530
Look at this! The champ is trying
desperately to stay on his feet,

1439
01:55:19,696 --> 01:55:24,868
but Kenton is relentless, landing
blow after blow after blow to the body!

1440
01:56:07,202 --> 01:56:09,371
Left! Right! Left! Right!

1441
01:56:09,538 --> 01:56:14,668
A huge uppercut by Atom! Zeus is down!

1442
01:56:19,339 --> 01:56:22,509
This little bot has
dug deep here tonight

1443
01:56:22,676 --> 01:56:25,304
and shown something damn near heart!

1444
01:56:25,470 --> 01:56:29,725
One, two, three,

1445
01:56:29,892 --> 01:56:34,771
four, five, six, seven...

1446
01:56:34,938 --> 01:56:35,939
He's good!

1447
01:56:36,106 --> 01:56:39,443
Zeus gets to his feet,
but Kenton has Atom on him again,

1448
01:56:39,610 --> 01:56:41,278
landing punch after punch!

1449
01:56:41,445 --> 01:56:43,906
Tak Mashido and his super bot
have no answer.

1450
01:56:44,072 --> 01:56:47,117
Zeus pins Atom's left arm,
but Kenton is undaunted!

1451
01:56:47,284 --> 01:56:50,203
It all comes down to this, folks!

1452
01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:52,205
Drop him, Charlie! Now!

1453
01:56:52,372 --> 01:56:55,334
- Kenton is about to drop the champ...
- No! There's the bell!

1454
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:58,629
Zeus is saved by the bell!

1455
01:57:05,594 --> 01:57:08,388
Amazingly, we will go
to the judges' cards!

1456
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:25,989
Ladies and gentlemen,
after five rounds,

1457
01:57:26,156 --> 01:57:28,825
we go to the judges' scorecards.

1458
01:57:32,788 --> 01:57:37,167
Judge Number One scores the fight 47-48.

1459
01:57:37,334 --> 01:57:42,255
Judge Number Two scores the fight 48-46.

1460
01:57:42,422 --> 01:57:47,052
And Judge Number Three
scores the fight 47-46,

1461
01:57:47,219 --> 01:57:52,432
for the winner
and still World Robot Boxing champion,

1462
01:57:52,599 --> 01:57:54,935
Zeus!

1463
01:58:02,317 --> 01:58:04,486
Farra Lemkova,

1464
01:58:04,653 --> 01:58:06,947
you got way more
than you bargained for tonight.

1465
01:58:07,114 --> 01:58:10,534
Some would say that your bot
won the decision but lost the fight.

1466
01:58:11,284 --> 01:58:12,577
She looks pissed.

1467
01:58:13,245 --> 01:58:15,539
It took a little longer
than we thought,

1468
01:58:15,706 --> 01:58:18,875
but the result is as expected.

1469
01:58:20,210 --> 01:58:24,631
We won. Zeus is still undefeated.

1470
01:58:30,053 --> 01:58:33,181
Any comment on the absolutely
humiliating near loss

1471
01:58:33,348 --> 01:58:34,599
your bot suffered tonight?

1472
01:58:37,686 --> 01:58:40,147
- Nothing.
- No comment.

1473
01:58:40,313 --> 01:58:41,732
Max. Where's Max?

1474
01:58:45,318 --> 01:58:46,528
There he is. Max.

1475
01:58:48,238 --> 01:58:51,742
They're already calling your bot
"the people's champion."

1476
01:58:55,162 --> 01:58:57,080
What do you say to that?

1477
01:58:58,081 --> 01:58:59,416
People's champion?

1478
01:59:02,002 --> 01:59:03,420
Sounds pretty good to me.

1479
01:59:09,301 --> 01:59:11,344
Dad? Dad!

1480
01:59:15,390 --> 01:59:16,558
Dad!

1481
01:59:27,444 --> 01:59:29,112
I really want you to know...

1482
01:59:29,279 --> 01:59:31,281
No, I need you to know.

1483
01:59:33,450 --> 01:59:34,743
Don't worry.

1484
01:59:35,786 --> 01:59:37,454
Your secret's safe with me.

1485
01:59:44,503 --> 01:59:46,171
Wait here. Wait here.

1486
02:00:31,049 --> 02:00:32,676
Yes!
