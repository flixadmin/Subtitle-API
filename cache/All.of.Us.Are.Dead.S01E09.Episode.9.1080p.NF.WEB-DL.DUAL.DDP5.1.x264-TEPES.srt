1
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,806
Cheong-san!

2
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,482
On-jo.

3
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,832
Su-hyeok!

4
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,959
Su-hyeok, are you, are you okay?

5
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:48,964
Shit.

6
00:00:58,975 --> 00:00:59,893
Who are you?

7
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,979
What the hell are you?
You come from the One Heart club?

8
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,649
ONE HEART

9
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,984
It's me.

10
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,153
Yeah.

11
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,405
You don't know?

12
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,784
How the fuck do you not know me?

13
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,244
I know you. I said it many times before.

14
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,367
You're the bullies' gopher.

15
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:27,670
If you call me that again, I'll kill you.

16
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,006
You weren't a gangster
and you weren't a good student.

17
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:32,842
And now you're not a human
and you're not a zombie either.

18
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,262
No matter the time or place...

19
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,182
you're nothing.

20
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,936
I won't just kill you.

21
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,734
I'll gouge out both of your eyes
and feed your blind ass to the zombies.

22
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:50,818
Oh, yeah.

23
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,240
Everyone but Cheong-san, can go.

24
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,534
Unless you wanna die with him.

25
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,792
You're all dead.

26
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,127
Let's go tie him.

27
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,631
Move.

28
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,084
Let go.

29
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,753
Let go!

30
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,278
You smell nice, huh.

31
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,953
You and me are on the same side.

32
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:06,995
Smell me.

33
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,082
Yeah, come on.

34
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,500
Fuck off.

35
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,645
Your shirt's ripped.

36
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,904
It's okay, now.

37
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,574
Damn it.

38
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,242
Ooh.

39
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,875
What the hell was this?

40
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,711
He was so strong.

41
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,339
Does anything else hurt?

42
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,882
Did your glasses break?

43
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,593
You're bleeding.

44
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,846
- So he's Gwi-nam?
- What? Damn it.

45
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,852
- What about me?
- Let me see.

46
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,476
You're okay.

47
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,811
It hurts like hell.

48
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,008
Shit!

49
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,595
We are on the same side.

50
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:06,407
EXAMINATION ROOM

51
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,875
Here you go.

52
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,958
Thank you.

53
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,979
They can't find
the homologous sequence of the virus.

54
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,231
What does that mean?

55
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,943
All living organisms have a root system,

56
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,488
if you follow a specific route,
you can trace it back to its origin.

57
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,200
Sort of like a genealogy for viruses.

58
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,993
But we can't figure it out.

59
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,539
Are you saying it's a brand new virus?

60
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:58,459
The KDCA is analyzing it too
but so far they can't identify it either.

61
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,297
We need to identify it
so we can start creating treatments.

62
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,220
You are supposed to be the experts.

63
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,390
How the hell could you not
have identified it by now?

64
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,518
It's strange.

65
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,188
The RNA structure changes
every time we test it.

66
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,943
It's almost like the virus
is evolving on its own.

67
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,202
We rescued a detective
from Hyosan Police Station.

68
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,663
And he seems to know
a lot about the virus, sir.

69
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,627
There's a laptop
in Hyosan High School that has...

70
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,045
Hey.

71
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,256
You need to start from the very beginning.

72
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,549
But we don't have much time.

73
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,722
The disease spreading in Hyosan
is called the Jonas Virus.

74
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,766
Lee Byeong-chan, a science teacher
at Hyosan High School, created it.

75
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,603
He left his laptop
in the school science lab.

76
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,632
He said it has everything we need in order
to get ourselves out of this catastrophe.

77
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,149
In his computer?

78
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,111
- Do you think his story is credible?
- Yes.

79
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,840
The research says
the initial reports of the outbreak

80
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,241
were from Hyosan Hospital's ER
and the high school.

81
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,828
And says the girl that was taken
to the ER was a student there.

82
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,498
I'm positive that Hyosan High School
was ground zero.

83
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,551
Keep questioning the detective.

84
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,386
Send Special Mission to the school.

85
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,639
Retrieve the laptop.

86
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,598
Yes, sir.

87
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,357
Eun-ji.

88
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,483
Eun-ji!

89
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,109
WAITING STATION

90
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,996
Are you doing okay?

91
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,832
I thought for sure you were dead.

92
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,376
You let me go knowing I'd die.

93
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,587
Uh, I'm sorry.

94
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,923
- I was just...
- It's fine.

95
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,009
That's just how you are.

96
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,095
Hey.

97
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,306
You wanna hear some good news?

98
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,600
I set the school on fire.

99
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,270
It's should be burned
to the ground by now.

100
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,356
You set fire to the school?

101
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,984
Yeah. It's great, right?

102
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,736
Are you all right?

103
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,573
I'm doing okay.

104
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,490
Why?

105
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,578
You don't seem like yourself.

106
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,206
I'm hungry.

107
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,875
And I get worked up when I'm hungry.

108
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,922
Do you want this then?

109
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,466
They're giving them out
but the line's crazy long.

110
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,510
You should eat first.

111
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,637
No, I don't want that.

112
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,266
But I think this is all they have.

113
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,269
I don't want that. I want something else.

114
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,812
Like what?

115
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:07,982
Mmm...

116
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,484
You?

117
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,194
Me?

118
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,197
Yeah.

119
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,950
I wanna eat you.

120
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,005
Damn, it stings.

121
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,844
What the hell is with that Gwi-nam kid?

122
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,263
You said he got bitten.

123
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,474
I don't know.

124
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,478
It looks like he became
something totally different.

125
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,063
I don't think he can die.

126
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,731
What if he climbs back up here?

127
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,777
He's bad enough...

128
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,614
but to be honest,
I'm scared of Nam-ra too.

129
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,699
You saw her fighting before.

130
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,700
Well...

131
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,996
I think it's reasonable to assume
they're both half-bies...

132
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,707
What?

133
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,503
Are you really okay, Nam-ra?

134
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,798
You won't do that to us, right?

135
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,594
Would you believe me
if I said that I wouldn't?

136
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,846
Why do you have to say it that way?

137
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,734
Can you at least try
to make us believe you?

138
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,187
We're going to be together anyway.

139
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,157
I...

140
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,829
I've never done anything but study.

141
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,376
I don't think I was naive,
I think I was a coward.

142
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,089
I was too scared my grades would drop
and my mom would get mad.

143
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,632
So I didn't do anything.

144
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,635
I was too scared to make friends.

145
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,683
My mom would always ask me
what rank they were in class,

146
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,352
what their parents did,
how big their house was...

147
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,862
I never thought I'd get a chance

148
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,656
to sit around a fire
with all of you like this.

149
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,288
It's really nice.

150
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,374
It's my first time.

151
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,004
If we somehow manage to get out of here.

152
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,423
I really hope we could make a fire...

153
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,717
and hang out like this again.

154
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,764
I really hope we can do that.

155
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,143
Sure, let's do it.

156
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,439
If anyone wants to make a fire...

157
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,985
we can all get together.

158
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,532
Sorry, Nam-ra.

159
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,873
Ooh. Did you just smile?

160
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,541
Super awkward.

161
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,794
God, come on.

162
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,463
What now? What?

163
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,673
Why don't you two just date already?

164
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,050
You guys are so annoying.

165
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,218
- Are you crazy?
- Psycho.

166
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,553
Hold on.

167
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,641
Did you hear that?

168
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,059
No, what is it?

169
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,436
What? Is someone out there?

170
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,525
Listen.

171
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,736
Huh?

172
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,533
What's happening?

173
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,787
What is it?

174
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,124
I don't see anything.

175
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,630
Hold on.

176
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,839
I hear a helicopter.

177
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,149
<i>Command, do you copy?
We've entered Hyosan airspace.</i>

178
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,277
<i>Approaching the school from the west.</i>

179
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Hey.

180
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,756
- Fire!
- Yeah, yeah. They see us.

181
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,258
- They're coming.
- This way. It's this way.

182
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,467
- Hey, right here!
- Here, here!

183
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,285
- Here. Hey, hey!
- Over here!

184
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,829
- Come on!
- Please help!

185
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,331
- Over here! Come on!
- Hey! Over here!

186
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,000
- We're here!
- Here!

187
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,103
- This way. This way. Look over here.
- Look at us, will you?

188
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,169
- Come save us!
- Here!

189
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,671
- Come save us.
- Can't you see us?

190
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,590
- We're here!
- Over here!

191
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,674
- Right here!
- Here!

192
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,009
- Hey!
- Look at us!

193
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,969
- Here! Help!
- Over here!

194
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,390
<i>We've entered the airspace
above Hyosan High School</i>.

195
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,850
<i>Ready for landing.</i>

196
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,316
- Down here!
- Here! Over here!

197
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,109
- Over here!
- Come on!

198
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,987
- Hey!
- Over here! Right here!

199
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,869
- Hey!
- Hey, over here!

200
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,504
Over here! Over here!

201
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,031
- Hey, hey.
- Whoa!

202
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,085
Get down.

203
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,877
All of you.

204
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,797
Sir.

205
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,298
Can you please help us?

206
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,594
Face down on the ground! Get down!

207
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,058
<i>Clear the area. Over.</i>

208
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,352
<i>High school roof.</i>

209
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,646
Nine survivors confirmed.

210
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,438
Their condition?

211
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,566
<i>Checking temperatures now.</i>

212
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,568
Clear.

213
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,404
I think they're checking if we're zombies.

214
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,905
- Clear.
- Don't worry.

215
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:30,823
Clear.

216
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,706
Clear.

217
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,878
Clear.

218
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,416
Clear.

219
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,928
Clear.

220
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,836
Temperature is 34.5.

221
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,060
Providing a warming blanket.

222
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,152
<i>One has hypothermia.
The rest are normal.</i>

223
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,739
Rescue them after you complete
the objective.

224
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,366
We'll rescue after
the mission's complete. Over.

225
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,828
It's okay. They're gonna rescue us.

226
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:19,787
It's over now.

227
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,417
You can get up now.

228
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,922
Are you the only survivors?

229
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,424
We don't really know.

230
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,760
There are probably others.

231
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,683
We're going down
for a few minutes.

232
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,971
Wait right here.

233
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,765
Aren't you not gonna rescue us?

234
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:38,974
Yes, we will.

235
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,809
So don't go anywhere.

236
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,561
Don't do anything. Just wait here.

237
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,330
- Understand?
- Mm-hm. Yes.

238
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,354
Let's go.

239
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,789
<i>Three men, standing by.</i>

240
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:02,872
<i>Chopper, report.</i>

241
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,258
<i>Copy that.</i>

242
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,846
<i>Inbound. Spotlight hot.</i>

243
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,974
<i>Roger that.
We're all set. Over.</i>

244
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,309
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

245
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,560
<i>Let's just go.</i>

246
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,354
The zombies went toward the chopper.

247
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,877
Let's just get up to the roof, okay?

248
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,865
Let's go.

249
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,579
How about him?

250
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,419
We bring him.

251
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,840
Be gentle.

252
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,109
- So, slower.
- Seriously.

253
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,194
- How's that? Comfy?
- It's good.

254
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,761
Don't put any straps...

255
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,597
- ...on my stomach.
- Okay, don't worry.

256
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,813
<i>The infected are converging
on the field and the front gate.</i>

257
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,940
<i>What's your status? Do you copy?</i>

258
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,110
We're clear. Moving in.

259
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,830
Report. What's the situation?

260
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,711
Hey.

261
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,882
Are they gonna kill all the zombies
before they take us?

262
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,134
I don't think so.
There's only four of them.

263
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,095
But they're Special Mission, right?

264
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,932
Are they looking for something?

265
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,393
Are they heading to the science lab?

266
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,695
- <i>We're in.</i>
- Do you have the package?

267
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,072
<i>Checking now.</i>

268
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,790
<i>The infected are getting
in your position. Do you read?</i>

269
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,166
<i>Prepare for extraction.</i>

270
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,753
<i>I still don't have the file.
Unlocking device.</i>

271
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,005
We have to get out.
Speed it up.

272
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,341
DECRYPTION COMPLETE, SUCCESS

273
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,176
File obtained. Heading out.

274
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,733
Moving out!

275
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,449
<i>Report your evac status
and the situation in the school.</i>

276
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,806
<i>The infected
are moving quickly to the science lab.</i>

277
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,540
Rescue the students and return to base.

278
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,207
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

279
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,295
Commander...

280
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,730
...we had an incident
in the quarantine camp.

281
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,089
What is it? What happened?

282
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,633
- Connect monitor 34.
- Yes, sir.

283
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,140
Rewind about ten minutes.

284
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,437
Where's the package?

285
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,128
- Ready for extraction.
- Coming down. Over.

286
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,367
Master Sergeant.
You go up first.

287
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,451
Yes, sir.

288
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,871
We'll pull you up
one at a time.

289
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,372
Stay still even if you're scared.

290
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,292
- Okay?
- You're not landing the chopper?

291
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:19,504
We can't. It can get unstable.
He's gonna pull you up, so don't worry.

292
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,268
You can't go all at once,
so let's go one by one.

293
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:34,436
We can't all go?

294
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,397
We can take all of you,
but it has to be one by one.

295
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:43,320
- Ji-min. You go first.
- You go first. Go first.

296
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,532
You go first.

297
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,882
Grab her!

298
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:06,676
Back off!

299
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,428
Calm down!

300
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,448
Stop! Calm down, calm down!

301
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,081
What the hell is that?

302
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,210
I believe she's infected but asymptomatic.

303
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,675
So she has a disease but...

304
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,302
there was no way to tell she was infected?

305
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,292
You're saying
we can't differentiate between

306
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,494
the healthy and the infected?

307
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,023
Connect to the team at Hyosan High!

308
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:29,050
- Yes, sir.
- Where's team bravo?

309
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,595
Don't rescue anyone.

310
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,639
Say again.
Did you mean everyone?

311
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,184
We just discovered a case as asymptomatic.

312
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,828
But their temperatures
are fine.

313
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,521
It was the same thing
with the girl we brought here.

314
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,875
<i>No one will be safe if one
of them gets sick in the chopper.</i>

315
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,151
If they resist... shoot them.

316
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,095
They're just children.

317
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,614
<i>Listen to me.
Soldiers are dying here!</i>

318
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:53,408
<i>Four men were attacked by one girl!
So do as I say.</i>

319
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,078
Understood. Over.

320
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,790
Cancel the operation.

321
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,168
We'll take just the package and pull out!

322
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,630
- Darn it!
- I think I'm going back down.

323
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,441
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.
- I'm coming down.

324
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,591
Wait a second.

325
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,986
- She's coming down!
- She's... she's coming down!

326
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,196
- Why is she coming down?
- What's wrong?

327
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,763
- What's going on?
- I don't know!

328
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,474
Why did you take that off?
Wait a minute. What?

329
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,772
- What operation is this?
- What are you doing? What is this?

330
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,023
Please just pull me back up.

331
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,525
Pull me back up! God, damn it!
I'm not going back.

332
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,861
I'm not going. I'm not going.

333
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,572
Take me with you! I'm not going.
Sir. Please.

334
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,741
I wanna get out of here!

335
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,910
Please, take me with you!

336
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,288
Come on, sir!

337
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,557
W... Wait a second.

338
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,042
What's wrong with you? We're fine.

339
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,377
<i>We're not zombies.</i>

340
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,879
Go ahead. Shoot.

341
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,339
Please, just take me with you!

342
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,508
Stand back.

343
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,759
Stand back, or we'll shoot.

344
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,261
Stand back!

345
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,805
All right team, get in the chopper.

346
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,390
I said shoot.

347
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:04,145
<i>Do you not hear me?
Shoot them. That's an order!</i>

348
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,815
Wait a minute.
You can't even take a few of us with you?

349
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,067
Shoot, you bastard. Shoot them now!

350
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,995
Be quiet.

351
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,670
- Quiet down.
- Damn it.

352
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,090
To the roof, right?

353
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,092
You think we'll make it?

354
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,178
We won't get up there in time.
Let's just try this building.

355
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,555
Let's go.

356
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,140
Wrong way.

357
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:43,435
- What? Okay. Let's go.
- Hey. Help me out.

358
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,769
Oh, shit.

359
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,024
I'm begging.
Please take just a few of us with you.

360
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,832
Rescue us.

361
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,382
I'm sorry.

362
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,419
We have the package.
All agents pulling out.

363
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,545
Return to the base.

364
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,341
Hey. Why is it coming this way?

365
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,465
Did you think they saw us?

366
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:57,485
Over here! Here! Look! Over here!

367
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,071
Look, right here!

368
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,325
Shit.

369
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,455
Oh, we're screwed. Shit!

370
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,039
- Run! Run, run!
- Oh, shit.

371
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,262
They abandoned us.

372
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,972
Didn't they?

373
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,184
No one's come to save us now?

374
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,104
But why did they do that?

375
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,898
Maybe...

376
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,401
they thought that all of us
were already fucking zombies.

377
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,820
They would have killed us.

378
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,490
They wouldn't have left us...

379
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,326
here alive if they thought that.

380
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,169
What are you doing?

381
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,047
It's pointless.

382
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,717
No one's coming. No one else is coming.

383
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,080
A witness stated that you
and your aide were accomplices

384
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:36,793
in Kim U-sin and Nam So-ju's escape
and result in an attack on our men.

385
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,921
He kept denying your involvement

386
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:43,049
so we asked you to come here
and answer some questions.

387
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,763
Are you recording this?

388
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,015
- Yes, we are.
- Wait a minute.

389
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,018
Aren't you supposed to tell us
if you're gonna record the investigation?

390
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:57,397
We're gonna record
this conversation. Give your consent.

391
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,774
Would you please point
the camera at me directly?

392
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,943
Go ahead.

393
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,157
Is it set?

394
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,325
Yes.

395
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,542
I'm Assemblywoman Park Eun-hee.

396
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:22,547
I've been accused of aiding and abetting
firefighters Nam So-ju and Kim U-sin,

397
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,258
who had saved my life,
and their escape from the camp.

398
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,843
I am being interrogated.

399
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,680
But I was not an accomplice.

400
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,892
I was the true offender.

401
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,477
Ma'am, are you kidding me?

402
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,396
That's not true. Stop recording, huh!

403
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,980
Stay back.

404
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,943
I don't understand why you're doing this?

405
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,111
What are you doing ma'am?

406
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,578
Do whatever you think is best.

407
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,039
I won't get involved anymore.

408
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:05,298
Firefighter Nam So-ju saved us,
and he did this despite the fact

409
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,925
that his daughter was nearby.

410
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,638
He tried to go save his daughter
after he saved us

411
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,932
but The Martial Law Units stopped him.

412
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,685
His daughter was everything to him.

413
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,688
I said I'd take responsibility,

414
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,859
and that he should escape by any means
necessary to save his daughter.

415
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,529
Even if it's not allowed
under martial law,

416
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,951
no one can ever stop
a father's love for his daughter.

417
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:38,122
Regardless of the punishment
imposed on me...

418
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,793
I will always stand with...

419
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,462
the powerless citizens.

420
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,124
On-jo.

421
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,207
Hey, Dad.

422
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:38,975
Please help us.

423
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,273
My wife and baby...

424
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,054
I can't do it alone.

425
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:19,140
We need equipment
in order to cut through the frame.

426
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,809
Please. Please help us.

427
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,102
I'm sorry.

428
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,397
I need to go find my daughter now.

429
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,899
I'm really sorry.

430
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,568
Please, sir. I'm begging you.

431
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,488
Our baby...

432
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,407
Please, sir. Save them.

433
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,451
Please, sir.

434
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:43,122
Listen to me.
They'll start sending rescuers soon.

435
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,686
You have to hang in there until then.

436
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,834
But those monsters,
they could have come first.

437
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,798
Shit.

438
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,517
Here.

439
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,895
Here. Take this.

440
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,868
You have to hang in there. You understand?

441
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,577
You have to help me.

442
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,413
Get back here.

443
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,373
Right now.

444
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,378
<i>There's no more hope left.</i>

445
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,800
It's like every sin entered the human body
in concentrated form.

446
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,302
Even if we can conquer this virus,

447
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,473
I worried that a world ruled by humanity
will never return.

448
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,393
Can we still believe people are beautiful

449
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,105
after seeing them
become the worst possible creatures?

450
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,107
If you shoot me now,

451
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,192
they'll come running right away.

452
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,111
We're gonna die anyway.

453
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,114
Whether I do or I don't.

454
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,784
My daughter is waiting for me.

455
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,500
I'm begging you...

456
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,045
Please don't go.

457
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,427
Don't go.

458
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,151
<i>There was something we'd say</i>

459
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,477
at the pharmaceutical company
whenever we hit a wall.

460
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,566
"Science begins with imagination
and ends as a mystery."

461
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,654
I went to see a shaman on my way home.

462
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,249
He told me this right here
would immediately fix everything.

463
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:58,299
<i>Please help me. Help me!</i>

464
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,801
I'm human.

465
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,511
I'm not a zombie!

466
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,684
You idiot.

467
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,569
She's either positive or negative
depending on when we test her.

468
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,571
What does that mean?

469
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,616
We have to assume it's a fusion
or some kind of evolution.

470
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,410
Like a mutation?

471
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,329
Yes, that's correct.

472
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,041
The virus is hiding
in the RNA of the cells.

473
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,043
We can only detect it when it manifests.

474
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,503
If it's dormant, it won't show up.

475
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:42,051
That means tests don't tell us
whether or not the subject is infected.

476
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,134
That's right.

477
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,441
It's like the human and the monster
are fighting inside the patient.

478
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,518
Is it at all possible...

479
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,104
that there are others like her?

480
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,859
As per KDCA's recommendation,

481
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,237
it's best to presume

482
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,657
that they're infected
even if they show no symptoms.

483
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,917
Going forward,

484
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,211
separate everyone from Hyosan

485
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,755
and considered them infected
but asymptomatic.

486
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:24,468
And monitor later rescues
separately and more closely.

487
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,472
Oh, I know.

488
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,933
Yeah. You really are amazing.

489
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,854
To use us in that situation.

490
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,400
She didn't use you at all
she just made the best of the situation.

491
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,278
When it rains,
you set up your barrels.

492
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:45,197
And when it's windy,
you set up the turbine, right?

493
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,490
That's politics.

494
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:50,119
You'll use that video
for your campaign, won't you?

495
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,957
Even though you didn't save anyone,
you'll get lots of votes

496
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,460
like you did something huge.

497
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,253
Hey, she did.

498
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:03,841
She took full responsibility
just to get you out of this mess, okay?

499
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:10,056
She never told our captain
he should try to run and escape.

500
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,477
Listen, U-sin.

501
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:18,898
Disasters usually create heroes. Huh?

502
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,649
Whether or not he saves his daughter,

503
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,819
Mr. Nam will come out of this a hero.

504
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:27,323
That's what we're gonna be
working on right now.

505
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,659
Don't you want your captain to be a hero?

506
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,662
- That's not what I...
- And we're all on the same page.

507
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,040
Let's look at the big picture here.

508
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,877
From this moment on,
we are on the same team.

509
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,714
We just have to stick together.

510
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:47,676
What the hell?

511
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,363
In the interest
of stopping this spread,

512
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,180
we're taking you to a special quarantine.

513
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,225
For safety reasons,
you'll be handcuffed during transport.

514
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,628
Do we look like criminals to you?

515
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,020
Why are you suddenly
imprisoning all of us?

516
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,315
Also, how dare you try to put handcuffs
on an assemblywoman, huh?

517
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,150
Please obey the rules.

518
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,446
Don't test my patience.

519
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,823
It's martial law,

520
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,510
- not a military dictatorship.
- Please obey the rules.

521
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,995
Listen, we won't follow
unprincipled rules.

522
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:19,166
Kill me first
if you're gonna take her away, huh!

523
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,627
- Come on. Make a shield.
- Yes, sir.

524
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,087
Hold on.

525
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,261
Make a shield.

526
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,751
<i>Attention,
all citizens in the quarantine camp.</i>

527
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,194
<i>In order to find those who are infected
but asymptomatic,</i>

528
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,489
<i>we are separating Hyosan citizens
from those of you from other regions,</i>

529
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,701
<i>as per the KDCA's recent
safety recommendation.</i>

530
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,370
I'm fine. It's okay.

531
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,684
<i>Until a reliable testing method is created</i>

532
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,293
<i>and the situation is resolved,</i>

533
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:07,256
<i>stricter quarantine rules will be put
in place effective immediately.</i>

534
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,301
<i>We apologize for the inconvenience
and encouraging to cooperate.</i>

535
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,264
What the hell's happening?
You said we'd be treated like heroes.

536
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,557
You shut up for once.

537
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,226
Did you find the laptop? What happened?

538
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,730
Come on, move. Let's go.

539
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,607
Hey, what about the laptop?

540
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,067
Can you at least tell us about that?

541
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,208
You okay?

542
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,043
My ears hurt so bad.

543
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:58,598
This should help.

544
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,080
It's raining.

545
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,208
It's raining.

546
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,922
Yes, it's raining!

547
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,340
It's pouring!

548
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,956
Ahh, it's so nice.

549
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,110
What the fuck.

550
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,119
Joon-yeong.

551
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,122
You know how zombies follow us
if they hear us?

552
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:11,125
Maybe if we move every time
there's thunder, they won't be able to.

553
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,598
I don't think anyone is coming to save us.

554
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:32,521
Wouldn't you rather die trying
to get out than die here?

555
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,941
All right then. What do you have in mind?

556
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:38,694
If we take the back door
of the auditorium to the tennis courts

557
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,448
and then go right through
the English center,

558
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:43,991
we can get to the mountain.

559
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,931
If we manage to reach the mountain,

560
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,100
we can make it all the way to Yangdong.

561
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,854
I've been hiking there
a few times before with my dad.

562
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:18,775
Even still, isn't this suicide?

563
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,986
I'm not going. I'm scared.

564
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,615
What are we gonna do
if the zombies catch us?

565
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,202
It's not like anyone
is going to save us if we stay here.

566
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,204
We're the only ones
who can save ourselves.

567
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,505
Let's go.

568
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:45,469
If anything goes wrong,
I'll scream and lead the zombies away.

569
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,764
That way none of you will get hurt, okay?

570
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:50,932
So let's do this.

571
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,935
Don't say that.

572
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,773
We're all gonna make it.

573
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,485
If anyone has to die tonight,

574
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:03,819
it will be me.

575
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,699
Because of the rain,
all the scents came to me at once.

576
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:08,909
They got mixed up.

577
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,496
The rain is really loud too.

578
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,126
I'm sure the zombies' senses are dulled.

579
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,754
If that's what a half-bie says,
it should be reliable.

580
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,297
What's a half-bie?

581
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:23,881
A half zomb...

582
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,053
someone you can rely on.

583
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,389
You guys ready?

584
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,183
Nam-ra is strong. She'll keep up.

585
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,269
Let's take her word and go.

586
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,979
I'm not strong right now.

587
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,062
Why not?

588
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,483
I don't know.

589
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,407
I think some of us
might not be able to keep pace.

590
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,493
We can't have anyone fall behind,
let's pair up and hold hands.

591
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,577
For protection.

592
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,246
Okay!

593
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,748
Hey.

594
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,601
- Wu-jin. Let's go.
- Okay.

595
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:21,772
Hey.

596
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:24,901
Stay close behind me.

597
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,324
Let's survive tonight.

598
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:32,951
We'll talk about us later.

599
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,966
Okay!

600
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:10,923
- Careful. Careful.
- Okay.

601
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,909
Don't let go of my hand.

602
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:24,878
Okay.

603
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,939
Damn it!

604
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,903
What are you doing?

605
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:50,987
My bad. My bad.

606
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,075
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

607
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,284
We trust you.

608
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,249
Be careful.

609
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:06,711
Careful.

610
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,671
- What's wrong?
- Hold on.

611
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,117
Can you see them?

612
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:51,381
It's gone.

613
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,108
Ready?

614
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,151
Let's go.

615
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,205
Hey.

616
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:24,873
They look so weird.

617
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:25,999
Can you just be quiet now?

618
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:28,168
Hey, come here and look.
Come here and look.

619
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,753
They look like total morons.

620
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,130
Hey.

621
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,132
I'm seriously freezing.

622
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,510
It must be the rain.

623
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,094
Hey, let's go.

624
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,778
It's our best chance to escape.

625
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,224
Let's go behind that building
and head up the mountain.

626
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,731
I'll lure that zombie
and go over that way.

627
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,567
Then you run.

628
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:35,901
No way.

629
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,418
I'll lure that zombie over and you can...

630
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:46,121
We'll go right along
the wall here and cross over there.

631
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,440
Get down. Quiet.

632
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,275
Hey. Stay low.

633
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,657
We have to go
along the wall.

634
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:23,575
Okay.

635
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,076
Go along the wall over there.

636
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,640
- Why?
- Back there?

637
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,830
I'll go first.

638
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,460
This way.

639
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:27,847
Cheong-san.

640
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,241
Is that you, Mom?

641
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,482
ALL CHARACTERS,
LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,

642
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,692
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.
