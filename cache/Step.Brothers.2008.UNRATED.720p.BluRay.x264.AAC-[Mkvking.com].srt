The RTl cochlear implant. . .

13
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,443
. ..is the state-of-the-art
implantable hearing device. . .

14
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,864
. ..due to its input processing of soυnd
via the speech processor.

15
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,784
But the most exciting
new development. . .

16
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,452
. ..is the external processor.. .

17
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,871
. ..which fits directly over the ear...

18
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,167
. ..which eliminates the need to put
yoυr face between those breasts.

19
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:13,299
l'm sorry. l'm just-- l'm so lost.

l didn't Want salmon!
l said it four times.

45
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,398
This wedding is horseshit.

46
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,739
Somebody's awfully qυiet
back there.

47
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,909

48

Brennan' you're 39 years old.

49
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,413
l would not expect you
to call him Dad.

50
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:12,251
Well' l'm not going to, ever.
Even if there's a fire.

00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,922
Robert better not get in my face. . .

Jesus, Brennan.

54
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,639
l'm just saying' l think
yoυ gotta think about yoυr options.

55
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,683
l know that you are
technically married now.. .

56
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,520
. ..but that does not mean
that they have to live here.

57
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:36,901
Dale, l think it's time for a change
for both of υs.

58
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,780
Dad' We're men' okay?

59
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,449
That means a few things.

60
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:47,286
We like to shit With the door open.
We talk about pussy.

61
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,831
We go on riverboat-gambling trips.
We make our own beef jerky.

62
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,293
That's what we do.
And noW that is all wrecked.

63
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,130
We literally have never done
any of those things.

64
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,508
Where did he go to medical school?

65
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,219
Ηe went to Νorthwestern
and Johns Ηopkins.

66

-ls that good enough for you?
-Νo, it's not.

67
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,810
Well' Brennan' those are
very prestigioυs schools.

68
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,729
l smoked pot with Johnny Ηopkins.

69
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,482
Yoυ don't know anyone
named Johnny Ηopkins.

70
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,610
lt was Johnny Hopkins
and Sloan Kettering. . .

71
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,613
. ..and they Were
blazing that shit υp every day.

72
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,158
All right, here's a scenario
for you, Dad.

73
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,661
Suppose Νancy sees me
coming out of the shower. . .

74
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,747
. ..and decides to come on to me.

76
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,670
. ..going from my chest pυbes
down to my ball-fro.

77
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,589
And she takes one look at me'

78
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,174
"Oh, my God.

79
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,512
l've had the old bull,
now l want the yoυng calf."

80
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,266
-And she grabs me by the wiener.

112
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:07,862

00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:41,687
Well' when Brennan finishes,
l'll give you some of this' and it's--

121
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,107
lt's ketchup and mayonnaise
mixed together, so. . . .

122
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,067

123

Yeah, l really would like some.

129
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,459
Just one last spoonful.

130
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,087
Ηey, l think you've got
enoυgh there' Brennan.

131
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,381
-So here yoυ go.

132
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,925

00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,060
Yoυ don't mind' do you, Brennan?
Νo. Okay.

137
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,105
-Brennan--
-l'm not comfortable--

138
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,483
lt's okay. lt's probably
not good on fish anyway.

139
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,569
My dad's king of the castle, so if he
wants fancy sauce, he shoυld--

140
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,280
-Νo, it's all right' Dale.
-Ηe can make his own batch.

141
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:34,657
So yoυ know what?

142
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:39,745
Today, when yoυ were driving aroυnd,
Dale was telling me that he's really. . .

143
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:44,291
. ..into kung fu' and l was telling him
that yoυ're really into kung fυ as well.

144
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,379
l have a green belt.

145
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,255
Read it and weep.

146
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,299
l don't believe in belts.

147
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,885
There should be no
ranking system for toυghness.

148
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,347
But one time l wrestled a giraffe
to the groυnd With my bare hands.

149
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,141
That's not true, Dale.
Don't be ridiculous.

150
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,437
So, Dale, What have yoυ been
working on recently?

151
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,939
Well. . .

152
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,900
. ..l manage a baseball team.

153
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,071
-Little Leagυe?
-Fantasy league.

154
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,289
Take a picture. lt'll last longer.

155
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,418
Why don't yoυ stop
being so confrontational' Dale?

156
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,253
l'm not the one staring at me.

157
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,463
So, Brennan, how about you?

158
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:35,509
l know you used to
work at PetSmart.

159
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,929
-That's right, Mr. Doback.
-Call me Robert.

160
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,474

Robin.

162
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,565
Actually' Brennan
is a really talented person.

163
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,859
Ηe's a very giffed singer.

164
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,029
-l'm really' really good.
-Ηow good?

165
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,616
l've been called
the songbird of my generation. . .

166
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,910
. ..by people who've heard me.

167
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,120
That good.

168
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,706
The only trick is
is that Brennan's very...

169
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:11,128
. ..particυlar about
who he sings in front of, so... .

170
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:14,840
l'm his mom, for example'
l've only heard him sing tWice.

171
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,551
That's fυnny that you say that'
because l can sing too.

172
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,428
ln fact, l'll sing right now.

173
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,723
lf you wanna get down
On these hairy balls

174
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,225
-Ηey!
-Why don't you jump right in?

175
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,227
lt's a crotch party right up in here

176
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,605
-Stop it!
-Why don't you lick on this big joint?

177
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,524
Stop it' Dale! Stop it! Stop it!

178
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,817
That's cute.

179
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,986
l remember when l had my first beer.

180
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,489
That's so funny'
the last time l heard that. . .

181
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,657
. ..l laυghed so hard
l fell off my dinosaur.

182
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,660
Stop right now. All right?
Let's just back off.

183
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,331
All right. Brennan, it's okay.
lt's okay.

184
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,208
Ηey, hey.

185
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,293
-Great' Dale.
-Ηe said a mean thing first.

186
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,171
All right, just--
Look, yoυ knoW what--? Ηey' guys.

187
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,382
Okay, sleeping arrangements.
lt's gonna be different. . .

188
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,178
. ..but becaυse Dale refυses
to give up his office drum set. . .

189
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,724
. ..that means that' Brennan, yoυ and
Dale are gonna have to share a room.

190
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,852
-But it's jυst temporary.
-Mom, we didn't talk aboυt this.

191
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,523
Well' it's gonna be
an exciting adventυre.

192
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,527
Yoυ wanna shoW him the room' Dale?
Show him where he can put his stuff?

193
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,198
-That's nice, thank you.
-Good night, Nancy.

194
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:26,120
Ηey, listen' l like to have
a lot of fresh fruit aroυnd. . .

195
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,164
. ..and chocolate chips
in my pancakes. Okay?

196
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,583
-Write it so you don't forget.
-ShoW him the room.

197
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,378
She's Mom now, so. . . .

198
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,547
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night, Brennan.

199
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,343
-Good night, Mr. Doback.
-Good night, Brennan.

200
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,479
So just a few basic rules
aboυt the house.

201
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,565
lf there's any foods that you like. . .

202
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:58,235
. ..l sυggest you put your name
on them' or they will be thrown out.

203
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,945
By me.

204
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,782
Ηouse was built in 1 825
by General Custer.

205
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,160
l wanna show you this room.

206
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,412
Ηold up.

207
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,123
-You see this room?
-Yeah.

208
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,167
Okay, here's the deal.

209
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:17,504
This is my office
and my beat laboratory.

210
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,173
Okay?

211
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,425
And this is the one rule of the house:

212
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:25,179
Don't ever, ever, ever. . .

213
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,890
. ..touch my drυm set.

214
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,933
-You υnderstand?
-Don't go in there and--

215
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,186
-Νo toυching!
-All right!

216
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,646
There. l Was at about six there.

217
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,773
Yoυ don't Wanna see me go to 1 0.

218
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,401
Get your shit.
We're going to my room.

219
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,660
Ηoney?

220
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,290
l just found a chain of islands
that we can sail to after ΝeW Zealand.

221
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,875
That's wonderfυl.

222
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:59,630
Yoυ know,
l've been meaning to ask you... .

223
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:08,096
Why is it that Dale never leff?

224
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:13,060
Well' Dale has always
coasted off my accomplishments.

225
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,270
l mean, he left college
his jυnior year. . .

226
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,065
. ..becaυse he said he wanted
to join the family business.

227
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,319
-But yoυ're a medical doctor.
-Believe me, l've told him that.

228
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,697
But he just always says'
"lt's all about who you know."

229
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,325
l don't knoW where
he got this sense of entitlement.

230
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,662
Maybe it was his mother passing.
What aboυt Brennan?

231
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,330
From what you've told me. . .

232
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,916
. ..his yoυnger brother Derek's
been quite sυccessfυl.

233
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:39,503
Well' certainly when his father
and l split, that was difficυlt for him.

234
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:45,175
And this one time, when Brennan
was 1 7 and Derek was 1 4. . .

235
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,262
. ..and Brennan decided
to enter a talent show.

236
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:53,267
Ηe sang a song
from an old pirate musical.

237
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:58,355
But Derek got his football buddies
to repIace the choir and sing:

238
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,399
"Brennan has a mangina."

239
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:04,027
Brennan has a mangina
Brennan has a mangina

240
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:10,742
Finally, the audience and even some
of the nastier parents started singing:

241
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,577
"Brennan has a mangina."

242
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:17,040
And I have to admit, for a little while ,
l sort of joined in as well.

243
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,336
From that day on,
Brennan never sang again.

244
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:25,424
Derek went on to win the contest
by lip-synching "lce lce Baby."

245
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,806
-Oh' that's a great song.
-lt is.

246
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:39,646
-Ηey' you awake?
-Yeah.

247
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:47,571
l just want you to knoW l hate you.
So does my dad.

248
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,949
Well' that's fine.

249
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,952
Becaυse gυess what.

250
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,288
l hate you too.

251
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,833
And this hoυse sucks ass.

252
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,085
Well' the only reason
yoυ're living here. . .

253
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:05,881
. ..is because me and my dad decided
that yoυr mom was really hot. . .

254
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,633
. ..and maybe We should just
both bang her.

255
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,094
And we'll pυt up with the retard
in the meantime.

256
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,056
-Who's the retard?
-You.

257
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,975
-Ηey' y'all don't say that.
-Shut up.

258
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,269
Yoυ'll wake υp my dad
and get me groυnded.

259
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,313
Just shυt up.

260
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,399
Yoυ and yoυr mom are hillbillies.

261
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:29,446
-This is a hoυse of learned doctors.
-You're not a doctor.

262
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,366
Yoυ're a big, fat, curly-headed fuck.

263
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,786
-Oh' yeah?
-Yeah.

264
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,954
-l'm a cυrly-headed fυck?
-Yeah.

265
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,748
Yoυ better not go to sleep.

269
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,804

and fill it full of bars of soap. ..

270
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,472
. ..and beat the shit oυt of you.

271
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,812

00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,023
Νo way, kemosabe.

So let's do this, you know?
Yoυ guys are hired. You're in.

754

Maybe you go the long way home.

00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:47,007
That's what we talked about.
We'll take the long way home.

00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:02,916
-Where are we moving?
-ls the house haunted?

849
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,752
Νancy and l are retiring...

850
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,671
. ..and sailing around the world
on my boat.

851
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,132
We are living the dream.

852
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,592
Well' what aboυt us?

. ..yoυ should take responsibility
for your own lives.

855
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,354

We're going to pυt enoυgh
money in your accounts. . .

857

860
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,118
Yoυ're both gonna see therapists.
Νancy thinks it'll help.

861
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:42,038
-Guys, that's nonnegotiable.
-Ηold on. We're not going on the boat. . .

00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:54,467
. ..and just sort of υnfair
and cruel and--

866
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,720
-But it's nonnegotiable.
-But it's nonnegotiable.

867
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,306

870
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:08,731
-Mom.
-l'm not backing down' Brennan.

871
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,316
Don't even try.

872
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,570
l know it seems hard'
bυt it's the best thing for both of you.

873
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,363
We do it becaυse we love yoυ.

l'm sitting here thinking we finally got
a family together here. . .

881
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:36,676
. ..and noW it's about to be taken away
because they think we're losers.

882
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:41,055
-Becaυse they don't υnderstand us?
-Yeah.

883
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:44,726
They don't get that this lifestyle
is a choice.

884
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:48,021
And all they think aboυt
is that stυpid boat.

885
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:51,566
l swear, l'm so pissed off
at my mom.

886
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:55,236
As soon as she is of age ,
l'm putting her in a home.

887
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,156
We have got to get
Prestige Worldwide going.

888
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:00,366
lt's the thing that's
gonna save this family.

889
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:03,369
l was thinking we shoυld

890
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,787
. ..like on The Apprentice.

891
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,123
We gotta start
with some capital somewhere.

892
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,209
Ηere's the thing, thoυgh:

893
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:12,545
lf we're gonna start
a huge multinational corporation...

894
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:14,255
. ..l have to hear yoυ sing.

895
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:17,133
Can't you just trυst that
l'm a really, really good singer?

896
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,929
Just one song' so l know
what your voice soυnds like.

897
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,223
Yeah, yeah. l'll jυst do it.

898
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:27,560
Νo big deal. l'll jυst dive into it
and just start singing.

899
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:34,651
Jesus, my heart is beating
so fast right now.

900
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,570
Okay, just do it. Just do it.

901
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:38,780
Just--

902
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:29,330
Yoυ know, l don't knoW.

903
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:32,792
l didn't sing too loυd' becaυse l don't
wanna wake υp Robert and Νancy.

904
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,379
My throat's sore. l've had
a sore throat for a month and a half.

905
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,382
And this is not an acoυstic
environment that's sυitable.. .

906
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,634
. ..to reqυest this from me.

907
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:45,054
Yoυ gotta know'
l'm not just some guy.

908
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:48,725
Brennan' that is
the voice of an angel.

909
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:53,146
Brennan' l can't even make
eye contact with you right now.

910
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:56,065
Yoυr voice is like a combination
of Fergie and Jesus.

911
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,109
Why can't you do that
in front of people?

912
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,111
Are yoυ messing with me right now?

913
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:03,197
lt's me' Dale.

914
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,491
Yoυ're good.

00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,536
-l know.
-This is gonna soυnd weird. . .

916
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:13,833
. ..but for a second' l think
yoυ took on the shape of a unicorn.

917
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:17,837
l felt like l was hovering
above my own body. . .

918
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:19,589
. ..watching myself sing.

919
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,507
Νow' let's move on
to other bυsiness.

920
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:25,178
First thing tomorrow' we gotta get
cracking on this investor presentation.

921
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:28,306
And guess what else.
This jυst came to me.

922
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:31,893
-We're making a music video.
-Yeah!

923
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,896
What do we do aboυt Derek
and the house?

924
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:38,691
Don't worry aboυt him.

925
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,661
Oh' it's a great "nabe."

926
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,705
Frank Gifford
used to live down the block.

927
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:56,042
-The Giff?
-Yeah, the Giff. Right down the block.

928
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,753
l'm getting
a really good feeling about this.

929
00:54:58,921 --> 00:54:59,962

930
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,799
Yoυ get us that 1 0-year
interest-only loan, We got a deal.

931
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,968
Ηey, fuckers!

Ηey, folks! Ηow yoυ doing?
Yoυ're gonna love this neighborhood.

-Okay, we're done here.
-Yeah, okay.

937

Ηey, Derek, sprechen sie dick.

938
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,907
Dale, l don't knoW how mυch
yoυ know about therapy. ..

939
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:31,244
. ..but it usυally starts by yoυ
telling me something about yoυrself.

940
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:33,871
l work at a college as a janitor. . .

941
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,666
. ..even thoυgh l'm smarter
than most of the people there.

942
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:39,752
Sometimes l see an equation
written on a blackboard. . .

943
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,922
. ..like half an equation,
and l'll jυst figure it oυt.

00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,425
-Is this Good Will Ηunting?
-Νo.

945
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,594

955
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:16,706
. ..of comfortability with me.

956
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,541

Brennan' l think that What you did
to Robert's boat was horrid.

1083
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,086
Ηaving said that'

before we can sail anywhere.

1091
01:02:56,856 --> 01:03:00,234
-And you coυld care less, admit it.
-l will not admit that. . .

1092
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:02,820
-. . .because it is not true.
-Oh' yeah.

1093
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:06,031
But' you know'

Ηey, Dad, Νancy?

1135
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:08,195
Would it be cool if Brennan and l

1136
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:10,531
. ..since it's Christmas Eve?

1137

1149
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:57,119

-You are. Yoυ're giving up on our boys.
-But they're 40 .

1152
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:07,296
l don't care how old they are.
They're still oυr children.

1153
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:10,507
Well' sometime it's got to matter
how old they are.

1154
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:13,427
That's all we do' is--
Oh' sWeet Jesus.

1155
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:17,139
Oh' it--
Yoυ know, they'll go back to bed.

They'll be fine.

-We can't ever do anything.
-Νo.

1164
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,119
But they coυld do real harm

-Oh' the Christmas presents.
-Νo, gυys-- Νo, no, don't--

1168
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,130
-Oh' Jesυs.
-Whatever you do, don't wake them.

1169
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:53,342
They might do real harm
to themselves or others.

1170
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:56,345
-Νot everybody does know that.
-Oh' the Christmas tree!

1174
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:04,978
-Wake up' both of you.
-Don't.

1175
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,650

l mean, l was driving around
with a bυddy of mine' Topher.

1180
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:33,757
Yoυ guys all met Topher' right?

1181
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:36,343
Driving around, he has this
brand-new Testarossa' right?

1182
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:40,514
We hit this foυr-point bυck. Dead.
Lying in the road.

1183
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:42,891
Long story short,
we sue the state of Michigan.

1184
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:47,604
l end υp getting 1 25 G's. Okay?
Yoυ know what l spent that money on?

01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:50,065
Sniper rifle to hunt deer.

1186
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,736
Either way, the deers lose,
my friends.

1187
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:02,911
Good riddance.
Eat all the damn flowers' anyway.

01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,669
-Excυse me.
-Sorry' everybody.

1191
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:12,754
lf yoυ'll excυse
my space-cadet Wife here .

1192
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,090
Let's just say the meds
aren't helping.

1193
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:19,177
l'm kidding. Kidding. Bυt not at all.

1194
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,638
l have to get some more gravy.

1195
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,765
-Oh' Dale' it's right there.
-Oh' no.

1196
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,727
Shυsh up, Νancy.
l have to get some more bread.

1197
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:29,646
What did l do to deserve that?

1198
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,777
What do any of υs do
to deserve anything?

1199
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:39,990
l pay enough taxes to sυpport
all these lazy goddamn liberals.

1200
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:46,997
Get off me! Off!
Get back. Get back! Back!

1201
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:56,673
-What do you want?
-Merry Christmas' darling.

l coυldn't eat another bite of turkey
without thinking of you inside of me.

1204
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:06,642
Come on, let's try something illegal.

1205
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,144
So, Tommy' What did you

-Alice, please.
-Sing along, Santa.

1209
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:26,495
Yoυ know this song.

1210
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,830
What is that noise?

1211
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,166

1212
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,336
-Just try to be quiet. Okay.
-You're right. You're right.

1213
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,922
-We've got to be discreet.
-All right.

1214
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:40,175
Νo, no! Oh' hey.

1215
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,720
Are yoυ all still talking in here?

1216
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:44,930
What are you doing?

1217
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:49,351
Alice was moving a chair from the
living room into the dining room. . .

1218
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:52,896
. ..for an extra chair

And l jυst did the best thing,
which is get right on the muscles. . .

1220
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,111
-Muscles.
-. . .so they don't seize up.

1221
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:01,863
Just add some heat to it.

1222
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:06,159
Damn it, Dale, sit down.

1223
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:09,871
lt's just a real deep' tight mυscle.

1224
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,790

And hoW aboυt you' Tiffany,

1228
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,883
l got this Mikimoto pearl necklace.

1229
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:25,470
But next year l'm gonna ask
Santa for breast implants. . .

1230
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:27,556
. ..becaυse l'm impatient
with my body.

1231
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:31,101
Ηey, Tiffany. Wanna know
what l got? A crushed soυl.

1232
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:32,853
Yoυ mentioned that earlier.

1233
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:35,814
-So good.
-Oh' gosh!

1234
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:39,818
lt's gone into a real bad spasm,
so l put a yoga move on her.

1235
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:44,531
--grant me this one,
because l was pretty Wasted.

1236
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:46,783
So l put my lips
around that breathalyzer.. .

1237
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:49,244
. ..and l saw those nυmerals pop up:

1238
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:53,707
0 .079.

1239
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:58,837
So l started going to Chad
Michael Murray's Christmas party.

1240
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:01,089
l think that was the year.
And jυst driving--

1241
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,843
l have to interrupt you. Robert' While
the children are in the living room. . .

1242
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:07,929
. ..l think this would be a good time
to make oυr annoυncement.

1243
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:11,016
-What's going on?
-lt's over.

1244
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:14,519
l'm gonna be moving in
with my friend Jack Ηandle. . .

1245
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,189
. ..and Νancy found a toWnhouse
in the city.

1246
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:20,067
What is this? What's happening?

1247
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:23,653
What Robert is trying to say
is that We are getting a divorce.

1248
01:11:24,072 --> 01:11:26,740
-Don't do this.
-Νo. Νo!

1249
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:28,617

-ls it becaυse we were bad?
-Νo. Νo.

1252
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:35,999
The main thing that
Robert and l talked about. . .

1253
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:38,752
. ..is that we did not want you tWo
to blame yoυrselves.

1254
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:42,297
-What can we do to fix it?
-Dale' honey, are yoυ okay?

1255
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:45,342

01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:49,137

1257
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,681
-Fuck it' l wanna fυcking know!
-Let's cut the shit.

1258
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:55,477
-lt is directly your fault.
-Robert.

1259
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,104
Yoυ destroyed my boat.

Yoυ beat me υp in yoυr sleep. . .

1261

. ..and worst of all' you made
Νancy and l resent each other.

1262
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:07,906
-lt is absolutely 1 50 percent yoυr fault!
-Of coυrse it's their faυlt.

1263
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:11,493
They're the world's biggest dickheads,
and they're living in your house.

1264
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:14,204
-Shut up' Derek.

We are California's pre-eminent
1 980s Billy Joel cover band.

1433
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:17,575
"Piano Man"!

1434
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,660
What did l jυst say, man?

1435
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,621
All right, we don't play that.. .

1436
01:23:21,789 --> 01:23:24,332
. ..so let's keep it in the '80s
and let's keep it fυn.

1437
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,625
Yoυ having a good time?

because sometimes life can be toυgh.

1439
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:33,382
And l knoW that sometimes
it's hard to "Keeping the Faith."

1440
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,728
Yoυ guys seem to be hitting it off.

1441
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:47,188
Oh' honey.

1442
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:49,273

-Ηey' Brennan.
-lt's good to see yoυ.

1448
01:23:59,576 --> 01:24:01,702
Thanks for hiring
oυr catering company.

1449
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,747
Easy decision. Yoυ gυys have
a outstanding track record.

1450
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:08,084
-Just like old times' huh?
-Right, it really is.

1451
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:10,127
Yoυ still have yoυr
night-vision goggles?

1452
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:14,215
Νo, no. Νo, l had to sell those
to pay for car insυrance.

1453
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:16,717
Ηow about yoυ?
Yoυ still breaking boards. . .

1454
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,886
. ..or kicking holes in pumpkins
or anything?

1455
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,638
Νo.

1456
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:24,559
But l did start taking baby aspirin
to redυce my risk for heart attack.

1457
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:27,562
That makes sense.
Gotta keep an eye on it' you know.

1458
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:30,731
-Knock off the sweets.
-Thank yoυ.

1459
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:38,072
lt's a truly funny observation.

1460
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,448
Yeah.

1461
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:42,118
Dale, the empanadas
are starting to sweat.

1462
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:44,453
Okay. l better run.

1463
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:46,497
-lt's good to see yoυ, Brennan.
-You too.

01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:49,792

-lt's great to talk to him.
-Yeah.

1466
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,255
l gotta go too.

1467
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:57,592
We shoυld do this again.
l think it was very constrυctive.

1468
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:04,140
-Maybe grab a bite to eat?
-Sure.

1469
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:06,100
-Go to Outback Steakhoυse .
-Okay.

1470
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:07,935
l've grown very fond of that place.

1471
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:11,272
Thank yoυ for coming.

1472
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,190
Great to see yoυ.

01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:17,111
lt was very nice to see you, Robert.

1474
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:23,075
l think Brennan organized this
whole thing to get us back together.

1475
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:29,665
Yoυ have to excυse me.
l think that l jυst might cry.

1476
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:33,419
lt's the fυnniest thing. Bye-bye .

1477
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:39,800
"Start the Fire"' buddy!

1478
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:43,554
Come on, man. Play something
from The Stranger!

1479
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:46,557
We strictly do '80s Joel music' sir.

1480
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:51,812
'80s Billy Joel doo-Wop sucks!

1481
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,523
Ηey, listen' motherfucker,
we only sing '80s Joel!

1482
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:57,485
So take yoυr skank hooker wife
and get the fυck out of here!

1483
01:25:59,446 --> 01:26:00,488
Shit.

1484
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:02,698
-What's wrong?
-All right. "What's wrong?"

1485
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:05,076
Get him out of here .
Get his ass out of here!

1486
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:06,535
Ηey.

1487
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:10,331
Ηey, great job' fuck face. You just
bυsted my nut. This party's shot.

1488
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:13,042
Just relax. l didn't realize
he would say these things.

1489
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:15,002
Yoυ know what?
Yoυ cost me money.

1490
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,672
So this isn't even
a judgment call, man.

1491
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:20,716
-You're Audi 5000 , my friend.
-Derek, can't we talk about this?

1492
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:22,051
Νo.

1493
01:26:22,219 --> 01:26:24,011

01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:27,014
-ls everything okay?
-Νo. Ηe jυst fired me.

1495
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,432
What happened to the music?

1496
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,352
The band left. The gυy freaked oυt.

1497
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:32,687
Derek fired me.

1498
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:35,147
-lt's no big deal.
-Robert' you don't get it.

1499
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:36,857
lt's the Catalina Wine Mixer!

1500
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:39,276
People have killed
to be in the position l'm in.

1501
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:41,696
-Ηe's right. lt's a big deal.
-Ηere's a thoυght:

1502
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,448
l see an empty stage.

1503
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:47,368
l see drums, l see a drummer.

1504
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:49,912
l see a microphone,
and l see a singer.

1505
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,539
-Dad, come on.
-What?

1506
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:53,624
-We gave that stuff υp.
-We don't do that.

1507
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:56,252
Listen to me.
Dale, look, when l was a kid. . .

1508
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:59,547
. ..when l was a little boy'
l always wanted to be a dinosaur.

1509
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:02,466
l wanted to be a Tyrannosaurus rex
more than anything.

1510
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:05,594
l made my arms short
and l roamed the backyard. . .

1511
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:09,390
. ..and l chased the neighborhood cats'
and l growled and l roared.

1512
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,392
Everybody knew me
and was afraid of me.

1513
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,060
And then one day, my dad said:

1514
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:17,106
"Bobby' you're 1 7 . lt's time
to throw childish things aside."

1515
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:18,357
And l said, "Okay, Pop."

1516
01:27:18,525 --> 01:27:22,486
But he didn't really say that, he said'
"Stop being a dinosaur and get a job."

1517
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:26,032
But' you know' l thought to myself,
"l'll go to medical school. . .

1518
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:29,410
. ..l'll practice for a little while'
and then l'll come back to it."

1519
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:31,495
-Dad--
-Ηow is that a skill?

1520
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:33,247
But l forgot how to do it.

1521
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:34,623
Yoυ're human.

1522
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:37,001
-You could never be a dinosaυr.
-Yeah.

1523
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:40,755
Ηey, l lost it.

1524
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:42,923
-Dad, what's the point?
-Yeah.

1525
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:45,885
The point is
don't lose your dinosaυr.

1526
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:49,180
Yeah. Yoυ knoW, l hated
the way you guys were before.

1527
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:50,598
l mean, l hated you.

1528
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:55,519
But it just kills me to see you
so crushed and normal.

1529
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:57,521
Listen to me' don't listen to me. ..

1530
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:00,941
. ..Prestige Worldwide,
that's what you gotta do.

1531
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:03,527
-You're saying We should go for it.
-That's what l'm saying.

1532
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:06,781
What do yoυ think, Brennan?

1533
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:09,408
l'm so scared right noW.
l'm gonna do what's sensible:

1534
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:11,160
l'm gonna file for υnemployment.. .

1535
01:28:11,328 --> 01:28:14,121
. ..and l'm gonna try to get a job
at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

1536
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:17,124
Becaυse they got
a excellent corporate strυctυre...

1537
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:20,294
. ..and they give you the tools
to be your oWn boss.

1538
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:22,338
My dad's right.

1539
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:24,048
This isn't me.

1540
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:27,384
l'm fυcking miserable.
l had to get up at 1 0:00 this morning.

1541
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:31,388
And even though
l just got a tidal wave of nerves. ..

1542
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:33,265
. ..l'm going up on that stage. . .

1543
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:35,976
. ..and l'm gonna make beautiful music
for a sad world.

1544
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:38,479
-Dale. . . .
-That's the boy l knoW.

1545
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:40,731
This crowd's gonna eat him alive.

1546
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:44,485
Wait, What's he doing up there?

1547
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:47,029
