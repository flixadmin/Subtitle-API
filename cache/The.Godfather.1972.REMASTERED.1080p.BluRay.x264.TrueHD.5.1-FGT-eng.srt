1
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:54,179
I believe in America.

2
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:57,224
America has made my fortune.

3
00:00:57,308 --> 00:01:01,437
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,358
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonor her family.

5
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:10,946
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,451
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,244
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:23,042
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,712
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:31,175
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:35,387
She resisted, she kept her honor.

12
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:39,725
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,523
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:51,070
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,700
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:02,247
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,252
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,923
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:17,554
Now she will never be beautiful again.

20
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:25,479
Sorry.

21
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:38,450
I went to the police,
like a good American.

22
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:41,203
These two boys were brought to trial.

23
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,082
The judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,

24
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,292
but suspended the sentence.

25
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,465
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

26
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,054
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

27
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:02,641
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

28
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:09,481
Then I said to my wife, " For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."

29
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:19,283
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

30
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:25,497
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

31
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,249
What is that?

32
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,220
I want them dead.

33
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,650
That I cannot do.

34
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,488
I 'll give you anything you ask.

35
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:05,412
I've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for help.

36
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,627
I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

37
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:16,548
Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

38
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:21,637
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

39
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,474
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

40
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,976
I didn't want to get into trouble.

41
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,729
I understand.

42
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:35,108
You found Paradise in America.

43
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:42,074
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

44
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,868
You didn't need a friend like me.

45
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:50,082
But now you come to me and say,

46
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,584
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

47
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,339
But you don't ask with respect.

48
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:02,135
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

49
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:10,727
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

50
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,355
I ask you for justice.

51
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,441
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

52
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,946
Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.

53
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,367
How much shall I pay you?

54
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,969
Bonasera, Bonasera.

55
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:48,140
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

56
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,810
If you'd come in friendship,

57
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:56,315
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

58
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:02,613
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

59
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,368
And then they would fear you.

60
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,999
Be my friend?

61
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,504
Godfather?

62
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,052
Good.

63
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:32,351
Some day, and that day may never
come, I 'll ask a service of you.

64
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,854
But until that day

65
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:41,944
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

66
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,446
<i>- Gràzie, Godfather.
- Prego.</i>

67
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,206
Give this to Clemenza.

68
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,962
I want people that aren't going to
get carried away.

69
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:04,216
We're not murderers,
in spite of what this undertaker says.

70
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,911
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

71
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:37,124
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

72
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,924
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.

73
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,267
Don Barzini.

74
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,953
Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.

75
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,289
Paulie! More wine.

76
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:06,338
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

77
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,673
Take a walk and do your job.

78
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:19,684
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

79
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,229
You watch yourself, all right?

80
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:47,629
20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.

81
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,966
In that little silk purse.

82
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,636
<i>If this were somebody else's wedding…
Sfortunato!</i>

83
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,971
Hey, Paulie!

84
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,850
I got two gabagool, capocol,
and a prosciut.

85
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,017
Stupid jerk!

86
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,070
What's the matter?

87
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,918
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

88
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:31,256
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

89
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,100
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me.

90
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:50,150
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!

91
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,196
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

92
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,496
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!

93
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,878
Come here, come here, come here!

94
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:28,688
…but towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

95
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,858
so for six months
he's worked in my pastry shop.

96
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,694
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

97
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,738
Now that the war is over,

98
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,825
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

99
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:45,789
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo…

100
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:51,503
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

101
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,965
You understand everything.

102
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,176
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

103
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:05,267
Wait till you see the wedding cake
I made for your daughter!

104
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,103
The bride, the groom and the angel…

105
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:17,904
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.

106
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:23,118
Give it to a Jew Congressman in
another district. Who else is on the list?

107
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,751
Hey, Michael!

108
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:55,025
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

109
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,241
Is this necessary?

110
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:07,954
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

111
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:14,711
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me

112
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,630
on the wedding day of your daughter.

113
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,133
May their first child
be a masculine child.

114
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,761
Michael…

115
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,932
That man over there
is talking to himself.

116
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,852
See that scary guy over there?

117
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,439
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

118
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:39,194
His name is Luca Brasi.
He helps my father out sometimes.

119
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,907
Michael, he's coming over here!

120
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,080
You look terrific!

121
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,458
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.

122
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,462
Your father's been asking for you.

123
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,382
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

124
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,844
Why does your brother
have a different name?

125
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,807
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen
in the street.

126
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,811
He had no home,
so my father took him in.

127
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,649
He's been with us ever since.

128
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,692
He's a good lawyer.

129
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:25,115
Not a Sicilian. I think
he's going to be consigliere.

130
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,118
- What's that?
- That's a,

131
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,996
like a counselor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.

132
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,166
You like your lasagna?

133
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,631
Don Corleone.

134
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,384
I'm honored and grateful

135
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:48,304
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding.

136
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,604
On the day of your daughter's wedding.

137
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:01,526
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

138
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:08,074
I pledge my ever -ending loyalty.

139
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:15,457
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

140
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,670
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.

141
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,547
Thank you.

142
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,390
Signora Corleone!

143
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,436
No!

144
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:32,635
Senator Cauley apologized for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

145
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:36,973
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

146
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,227
What is that outside?

147
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,866
Johnny! Johnny!

148
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,577
I love you!

149
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:11,299
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

150
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:14,886
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

151
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:20,224
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

152
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,660
You never said
you knew Johnny Fontane!

153
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:42,830
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

154
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:46,751
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?

155
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,919
How?

156
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,299
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael…

157
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,793
Please, Michael. Tell me.

158
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:37,343
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

159
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,304
with a big bandleader.

160
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:44,642
And as his career got better and better,
he wanted to get out of it.

161
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,396
Johnny is my father's godson.

162
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,816
My father went to see this bandleader.

163
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,778
He offered him $ 10,000
to let Johnny go,

164
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,614
but the bandleader said no.

165
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:04,078
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

166
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,082
Within an hour,

167
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:13,671
he signed a release
for a certified check of $ 1,000.

168
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,635
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

169
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:26,184
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

170
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:31,522
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

171
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,154
That's a true story.

172
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,251
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

173
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,516
Beautiful!

174
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,883
I'll take care of it.

175
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,844
Tom…

176
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:46,639
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

177
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,858
How are you, Fredo?

178
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,527
My brother Fredo, this is Kay Adams.

179
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,905
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

180
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:09,370
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

181
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,039
Yeah. This is your friend?

182
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:16,794
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.

183
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:24,969
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

184
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:30,391
But this… man won't give it to me,
the head of the studio.

185
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,728
- What's his name?
- Woltz.

186
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:37,982
He won't give it to me,
and he says there's no chance.

187
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,529
Sonny?

188
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,324
Sonny?

189
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:53,998
Sonny?

190
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,585
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?

191
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,545
The old man wants you.

192
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,506
One minute.

193
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:21,984
A month ago he bought the movie rights
to this book, a best -seller.

194
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,655
The main character
is a guy just like me.

195
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,407
I wouldn't even have to act.

196
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:32,203
Godfather, I don't know what to do.

197
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:37,792
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

198
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:43,589
Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood
finocchio that cries like a woman?

199
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:47,718
"What can I do? What can I do?"
What is that nonsense?

200
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:49,512
Ridiculous.

201
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:57,353
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

202
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,063
Good.

203
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:03,818
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

204
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,910
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

205
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:18,290
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

206
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:21,502
It's too late,
they start shooting in a week.

207
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,755
I'm going to make him an offer
he can't refuse.

208
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:32,596
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

209
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,810
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.

210
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:08,174
- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.

211
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,886
Do we give your son -in -law
something important?

212
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:17,308
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.

213
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:20,186
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.

214
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:24,732
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.

215
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:29,236
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.

216
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:34,658
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

217
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:40,122
If there's nothing else, I 'd like to go
to my daughter's wedding.

218
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:45,252
Carlo, we're going to take the picture.

219
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,089
Wait a minute.

220
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,466
No, Michael. Not me.

221
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,848
Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!

222
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,170
- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.

223
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:54,673
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

224
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:58,510
This friend would give
his friendship to Mr. Woltz,

225
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,430
if Mr. Woltz would grant us a favor.

226
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,849
Woltz is listening.

227
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:08,020
Give Johnny the part in that war film
you're starting next week.

228
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:18,739
And what favor would your friend
grant Mr. Woltz?

229
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:22,368
He could make your future union
problems disappear.

230
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:26,538
And one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin.

231
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:30,918
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son -of-a -bitch!

232
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,587
Let me lay it on the line.

233
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:35,673
Johnny Fontane
will never get that movie!

234
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:40,302
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

235
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:44,223
- I'm German -Irish.
- Listen here, my Kraut -Mick friend.

236
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:48,686
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened…

237
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:52,147
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

238
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,776
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

239
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,861
I'll wait for your call.

240
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:02,574
By the way,
I admire your pictures very much.

241
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,872
Check him out.

242
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,939
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.

243
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:38,527
- It used to decorate a king's palace.
- Very nice.

244
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,988
Why didn't you say
you work for Corleone?

245
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:45,326
I thought you were some cheap hustler
Johnny was running in.

246
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:48,746
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

247
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:52,333
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.

248
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,002
You do appreciate beauty, don't you?

249
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:01,008
There you are. $600,000 on four hoofs.

250
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:05,054
I bet Russian czars never paid
that for a single horse.

251
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,680
Khartoum.

252
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,599
Khartoum.

253
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:14,521
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

254
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,649
Thanks, Tony.

255
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:21,362
Let's get something to eat.

256
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:24,865
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

257
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:29,370
To the Italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

258
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:33,374
I respect it.
Tell him to ask me anything else.

259
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,793
This favor I can't give him.

260
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:39,171
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

261
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:45,427
You don't understand.
Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.

262
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:49,181
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

263
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:53,394
I'm going to run him out of the business,
and let me tell you why.

264
00:30:55,396 --> 00:31:00,067
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protégés.

265
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:05,531
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

266
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:10,244
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.

267
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:13,122
Let me be even more frank.

268
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:18,210
To show you that I'm not a hard -hearted
man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

269
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,922
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

270
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:27,428
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

271
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:33,642
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

272
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,436
And she runs off.

273
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:40,858
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

274
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:46,113
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

275
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,532
You get the hell out of here!

276
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:52,995
If that goombah tries any rough stuff,
tell him I'm no bandleader.

277
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:57,291
Yeah, I heard that story.

278
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:02,129
Thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

279
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:05,090
Maybe your car can take me
to the airport.

280
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:08,760
Mr. Corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately.

281
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:05,377
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

282
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,547
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

283
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,881
Now…

284
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:15,429
Sollozzo is known as The Turk.

285
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,472
He's supposed to be very good
with a knife,

286
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:21,977
<i>but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.</i>

287
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,314
<i>His business is narcotics.</i>

288
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:28,775
<i>He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.</i>

289
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:32,696
<i>In Sicily he has plants
to process them into heroin.</i>

290
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:36,283
<i>He needs cash,
he needs protection from the police.</i>

291
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:40,287
<i>He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.</i>

292
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:45,626
<i>The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.</i>

293
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,506
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.

294
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,343
He's known as a top narcotics man.

295
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:59,097
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

296
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,809
Tom?

297
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:07,064
<i>Yes. There's more money in narcotics
than anything else.</i>

298
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:11,902
<i>If we don't get into it, somebody else
will, maybe the five families.</i>

299
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:16,448
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

300
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,617
Then they come after us.

301
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:25,248
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great¤, but narcotics is the future.

302
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:30,462
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in 10 years' time.

303
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:38,095
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

304
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,601
Don Corleone.

305
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:49,981
I need a man who has powerful friends.

306
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:52,818
I need a million dollars in cash.

307
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:58,740
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

308
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,204
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30%.

309
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:08,250
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

310
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,335
And then it would go up.

311
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:14,965
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

312
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,802
My compliments.

313
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:25,892
I'll take care of them, out of my share.

314
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:30,272
So I receive 30% for finance,

315
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,692
political influence and legal protection?

316
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,485
That's right.

317
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:40,699
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

318
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:46,079
If you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance,

319
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,331
te salud, Don Corleone.

320
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:04,097
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,

321
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:06,433
to be treated with respect.

322
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:14,399
But, I must say no to you.

323
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,403
And I'll give you my reason.

324
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:21,323
It's true,
I have a lot of friends in politics.

325
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:26,995
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

326
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:32,709
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

327
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:37,798
It doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a living.

328
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:43,136
But your business is… a little dangerous.

329
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,641
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

330
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:51,228
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our…
- Wait a minute.

331
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:03,323
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children, and I spoil them.

332
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,660
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway…

333
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:12,165
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to
congratulate you on your new business.

334
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:15,710
I know you'll do well, and good luck.

335
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:20,632
Especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine. Thank you.

336
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:43,196
Santino.

337
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,115
Come here.

338
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,369
What's the matter with you?

339
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:54,082
Your brain is going soft
from playing with that girl.

340
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:58,295
Never tell anybody outside the family
what you're thinking again.

341
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:00,839
Go on.

342
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,637
Tom, what's this nonsense?

343
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:11,141
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

344
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,062
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

345
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,899
And

346
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,110
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

347
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:31,661
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

348
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:34,706
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

349
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:39,336
Go to the Tattaglias.

350
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:43,715
Make them think that you're not
too happy with our family

351
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,469
and find out what you can.

352
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:08,239
I got something for your mother
and for Sonny

353
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:12,994
and a tie for Freddy,
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

354
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:16,331
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

355
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:50,156
<i>Andiamo, Fredo.</i>

356
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,660
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.

357
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:57,747
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

358
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,752
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.

359
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,341
<i>Buon natale, Caro. Gràzie.</i>

360
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:55,263
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

361
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,191
You know who I am?

362
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:07,609
I know you.

363
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:12,489
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family… right?

364
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:17,494
I think you and I can do business.

365
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:21,998
I need someone strong like you.

366
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:25,460
I heard you are not happy…

367
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,171
…with the Corleone family.

368
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:30,673
Want to join me?

369
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,802
What's in it for me?

370
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:39,349
$50,000 to start with.

371
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:42,602
Not bad!

372
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,897
Agreed?

373
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:49,043
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

374
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:54,090
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

375
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:57,218
Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.

376
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:03,558
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

377
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,101
Get in.

378
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:19,824
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.

379
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:29,459
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

380
00:45:57,005 --> 00:46:01,050
Would you like me better
if I were a nun? Like in the story.

381
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,179
No.

382
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:09,642
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

383
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:14,188
Michael.

384
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,691
No, I wouldn't like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

385
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,568
What's the matter?

386
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,129
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

387
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:03,696
<i>- Sonny, it's Michael.
- Where have you been?</i>

388
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,532
<i>- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.</i>

389
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:10,661
<i>There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.</i>

390
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:15,875
<i>- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.</i>

391
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,880
<i>- Where have you been? I was worried.
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?</i>

392
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:25,009
<i>No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?</i>

393
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:34,060
Oh, my God.

394
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,482
Sonny!

395
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:50,660
Stay back there.

396
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:53,413
- Who is it?
- Open up, it's Clemenza.

397
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:59,085
There's more news about your old man.

398
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:01,337
Word is out that he's already dead.

399
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:05,675
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

400
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:09,095
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

401
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:11,597
- How often?
- Only three, four times.

402
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:15,476
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

403
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:20,398
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him
to my father's house right now.

404
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:23,568
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

405
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:36,747
I'm going to have a couple of our people
come over to the house.

406
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,836
<i>- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?</i>

407
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,755
<i>- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.</i>

408
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:48,551
<i>In three hours he'll be released
with our proposition.</i>

409
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,971
<i>Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.</i>

410
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:56,684
<i>What's done is done. Don't lose that
famous temper of yours, Sonny.</i>

411
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,478
I'll wait.

412
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,827
Your boss is dead.

413
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:22,084
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

414
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:27,048
I want you to help the Corleones
and me.

415
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:35,515
We got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

416
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:38,226
Drink it.

417
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,442
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

418
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:53,449
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

419
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,662
And you knew
it was the right thing to do.

420
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:03,960
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.

421
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:11,884
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

422
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:17,056
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

423
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:22,353
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.

424
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:28,359
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

425
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:36,200
Well, now he's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

426
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:43,874
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

427
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:50,923
It's good business, Tom.

428
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:57,138
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

429
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,976
Yeah, well…

430
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,188
Let me worry about Luca.

431
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,779
You just talk to Sonny.

432
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:16,115
And the other two kids.

433
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,579
- I'll do my best.
- Good.

434
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:26,375
Now you can go.

435
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:37,887
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

436
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,431
Blood is a big expense.

437
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:03,537
He's still alive.

438
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:07,583
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

439
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:12,421
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

440
00:52:57,133 --> 00:53:01,971
Your mother is at the hospital with
your father. Looks like he'll pull through.

441
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:10,438
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon…

442
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:13,941
- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.

443
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,485
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

444
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:20,865
What about Luca?
Sollozzo thinks he can control him.

445
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:24,744
If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.

446
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:28,414
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

447
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:32,543
- Hey, do me a favor…
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

448
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:39,842
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?

449
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:47,183
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

450
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:52,938
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

451
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:57,568
This is almost 1 946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

452
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,320
If your father dies

453
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,491
you make the deal.

454
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:08,454
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

455
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:14,543
What is it?

456
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:21,342
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

457
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,552
Tessio, go see what it is.

458
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:29,141
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

459
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:32,978
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

460
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:36,649
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

461
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:39,360
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

462
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:47,159
Take care of that son -of-a -bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

463
00:54:47,243 --> 00:54:50,830
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.

464
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:55,209
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

465
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:59,004
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

466
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:05,261
Hanging around the house
on the phone would be a big help.

467
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,055
Try Luca again.

468
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:19,733
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

469
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:22,695
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

470
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:38,502
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

471
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:40,254
Probably late.

472
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,468
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

473
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:53,225
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear -view mirror.

474
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:58,188
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

475
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:04,153
We have to find a spot on the
West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.

476
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:07,740
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

477
00:56:07,823 --> 00:56:11,577
Think while you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.

478
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,412
Watch the kids.

479
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:30,095
Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up
18 mattresses and bring me the bill.

480
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:31,597
Yeah, all right.

481
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,101
Make sure they're clean, because
the guys will be there a long time.

482
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:40,439
- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.

483
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:44,485
Exterminate! Watch out,
so we don't exterminate you!

484
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,702
Pull over. I've got to take a leak.

485
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,789
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

486
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:59,852
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

487
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:03,897
- Yeah.
- Phone call!

488
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:12,156
- Who is it?
- Some girl.

489
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:18,871
<i>- Hello. Kay?
- How's your father?</i>

490
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,956
He's going to make it.

491
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,250
<i>I love you.</i>

492
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,295
I>I love you!

493
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:29,757
<i>- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.</i>

494
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,760
<i>- Tell me you love me.
- I can't talk.</i>

495
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,720
<i>Can't you say it?</i>

496
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,806
I'll see you tonight.

497
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:41,727
Why don't you tell that nice girl
you love her?

498
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:46,607
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

499
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:52,571
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

500
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:56,283
You start with a little oil,
then fry some garlic.

501
00:58:56,408 --> 00:59:02,039
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

502
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:06,210
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

503
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:10,172
Add a little bit of wine.

504
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:17,846
And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.

505
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:22,226
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?

506
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:24,520
You won't see him no more.

507
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,482
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

508
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:32,069
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital…

509
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:35,489
He'll be all right.
Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

510
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,574
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

511
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,996
Send somebody with him anyway.

512
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:14,111
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

513
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:20,242
No, Kay. There will be detectives there,
people from the press.

514
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:22,452
I'll wait in the cab.

515
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,708
I don't want you to get involved.

516
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:32,671
When will I see you again?

517
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:43,140
Go back to New Hampshire,
and I'll call you at your parents' house.

518
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:49,605
- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.

519
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:05,657
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

520
01:03:05,741 --> 01:03:09,244
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

521
01:03:09,328 --> 01:03:11,663
What happened to the guards?

522
01:03:11,747 --> 01:03:17,169
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

523
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:20,589
The police made them leave
about 10 minutes ago.

524
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:29,056
Get me Long Beach 45620, please.

525
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,935
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

526
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:42,819
Sonny, I'm at the hospital.
I got here late, there's nobody here.

527
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:47,199
No Tessio's men,
no detectives, nobody. Papa's all alone.

528
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:49,785
<i>- Don't panic.
- I won't panic.</i>

529
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:54,122
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

530
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,669
We're going to move him
to another room.

531
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:02,756
Can you disconnect the tubes?

532
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:06,385
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?

533
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:10,764
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

534
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,641
Help me, please.

535
01:05:29,718 --> 01:05:33,513
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the baker.

536
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,600
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

537
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:39,811
You'd better go,
there's going to be trouble.

538
01:05:39,895 --> 01:05:44,524
If there is trouble, I'll stay here
to help you. For your father.

539
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:50,655
Listen. Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital, all right?

540
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:52,824
I'll be out in a minute.

541
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:10,342
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

542
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:14,346
I'm with you now.

543
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,516
I'm with you.

544
01:06:52,968 --> 01:06:55,136
Get rid of these. Come here.

545
01:06:56,096 --> 01:07:00,517
Put your hand in your pocket,
like you have a gun. You'll be all right.

546
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:53,528
You did good.

547
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:45,288
I thought all you Guinea hoods
were locked up!

548
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:50,001
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!

549
01:08:50,085 --> 01:08:54,005
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

550
01:08:54,130 --> 01:09:00,053
- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

551
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:04,182
- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.

552
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:08,103
- He's a war hero. He's never been…
- I said take him in!

553
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:16,528
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

554
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:18,488
Stand him up straight.

555
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:46,266
I'm the Corleones' attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

556
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:48,768
They're licensed to carry firearms.

557
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:53,273
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show cause.

558
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:55,358
Let him go.

559
01:10:27,766 --> 01:10:31,686
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.

560
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:34,647
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

561
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:37,901
We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.

562
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:41,029
Jesus Christ.

563
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:50,205
Looks like a fortress around here.

564
01:10:52,332 --> 01:10:57,712
Tamaduch! Hey… 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

565
01:10:57,796 --> 01:11:01,382
That Turk shows one hair on his ass,
he's dead.

566
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:05,512
Mike, let me look at you.

567
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:12,602
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

568
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:18,316
The Turk wants to talk!
Imagine the nerve of the son -of-a -bitch.

569
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:21,152
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

570
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:26,074
What did he say… He wants us to send
Michael to hear the proposition.

571
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:29,619
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

572
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,789
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

573
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:37,168
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

574
01:11:37,252 --> 01:11:40,380
No more! Not this time, Consigliere.

575
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:44,008
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

576
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:47,136
I want Sollozzo, or we go to war…

577
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:50,181
- The other families…
- They hand me Sollozzo!

578
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:52,559
This is business, not personal!

579
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:57,063
- They shot my father…
- Even that was business, not personal.

580
01:11:57,981 --> 01:12:01,734
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favor.

581
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:05,822
No more advice on how
to patch things up. Just help me win.

582
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:16,040
I found out about Captain McCluskey,
who broke Mike's jaw.

583
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:20,420
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money.

584
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:24,549
McCluskey has agreed
to be The Turk's bodyguard.

585
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:28,386
So when Sollozzo is being guarded,
he's invulnerable.

586
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:32,056
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

587
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:38,104
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

588
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:42,025
Even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

589
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:47,155
Do me a favor.
Take this into consideration.

590
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:52,994
All right, we'll wait.

591
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:01,252
We can't wait. We can't wait.

592
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:06,674
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

593
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:10,470
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

594
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:14,849
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

595
01:13:14,933 --> 01:13:19,520
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

596
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:27,570
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

597
01:13:28,446 --> 01:13:32,867
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.

598
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:36,871
Let's set the meeting.

599
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,752
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

600
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:48,383
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

601
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:52,220
Some place where there are people,
so I feel safe.

602
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:57,976
They'll search me
when I meet them, right?

603
01:13:58,059 --> 01:14:00,395
So I can't have a weapon on me.

604
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:08,736
But if Clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me

605
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,910
then I'll kill them both.

606
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:32,719
Nice college boy. Didn't want to
get mixed up in the family business.

607
01:14:32,844 --> 01:14:36,472
Now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you?

608
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:43,104
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

609
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:46,232
You're taking this very personal.

610
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:49,736
Tom, this is business
and he's taking it personal.

611
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:53,322
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey…

612
01:14:53,448 --> 01:14:59,537
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs, a dishonest cop.

613
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:04,876
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

614
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:09,547
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

615
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:14,844
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

616
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:22,101
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

617
01:15:25,313 --> 01:15:26,856
It's as cold as they come.

618
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:30,193
Impossible to trace,
so you don't worry about prints.

619
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:34,655
I put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

620
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,920
Is the trigger too tight?

621
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:53,466
My ears!

622
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:58,179
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain -in -the -ass innocent bystanders.

623
01:15:59,347 --> 01:16:02,266
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

624
01:16:04,644 --> 01:16:08,314
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

625
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:11,943
Let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

626
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:16,447
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

627
01:16:16,531 --> 01:16:19,408
so walk out fast, but don't run.

628
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:22,912
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

629
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:26,499
They'll be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

630
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:32,797
You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation,
nobody knows where,

631
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,966
and we'll catch the hell.

632
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:39,428
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

633
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:42,557
All the other families will probably
line up against us.

634
01:16:42,682 --> 01:16:48,229
These things have to happen every five,
10 years. Gets rid of the bad blood.

635
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:52,775
Been 10 years since the last one.
You have to stop them at the beginning.

636
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:58,614
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.

637
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:04,537
You know, Mike, we were all proud
of you. Being a hero and all.

638
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,330
Your father too.

639
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,830
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

640
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:53,044
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

641
01:17:53,127 --> 01:17:55,463
How much time do we have?

642
01:17:56,339 --> 01:18:01,135
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

643
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:07,016
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.

644
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:12,939
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

645
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:18,152
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

646
01:18:18,236 --> 01:18:21,614
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

647
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:25,743
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

648
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:29,163
Sollozzo might not even be
in the car, Sonny!

649
01:18:29,247 --> 01:18:30,748
I'll get it.

650
01:18:56,023 --> 01:18:58,192
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

651
01:18:58,276 --> 01:19:01,612
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

652
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:07,451
A police captain is on call 24 hours
a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.

653
01:19:07,535 --> 01:19:12,415
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

654
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:17,461
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

655
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:23,384
They've got an old -fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

656
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:28,472
We might be able to
tape the gun behind it.

657
01:19:28,556 --> 01:19:32,685
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

658
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:36,647
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

659
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:42,069
Then you go to take a leak. No,
better still, you ask permission to go.

660
01:19:42,153 --> 01:19:46,615
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

661
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:50,870
I want somebody very good
to plant that gun.

662
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:54,457
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

663
01:19:54,540 --> 01:20:00,087
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

664
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:01,839
Let's move.

665
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:10,514
Did he tell you to drop the gun
right away?

666
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:12,475
Yeah, a million times.

667
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:21,442
Don't forget. Two shots apiece
in the head as soon as you come out.

668
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:31,619
How long do you think it will be
before I can come back?

669
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:34,538
At least a year.

670
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:39,460
I'll square it with Mom, that you're not
seeing her before you leave and…

671
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:44,840
I'll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right.

672
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:52,181
Take care.

673
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:56,727
Take care, Mike.

674
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:33,347
I'm glad you came. I hope
we can straighten everything out.

675
01:21:34,557 --> 01:21:39,645
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

676
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:44,066
I want to straighten everything out.
Don't want my father bothered again.

677
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:47,403
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.

678
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:51,699
But you have to keep an open mind
when we talk.

679
01:21:51,782 --> 01:21:56,203
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

680
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,748
He's a good kid.

681
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:07,214
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

682
01:22:07,298 --> 01:22:11,385
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

683
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:21,187
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

684
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:26,442
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

685
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:30,154
He's clean.

686
01:22:56,764 --> 01:22:59,058
Going to Jersey?

687
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,103
Maybe.

688
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:30,172
Nice work, Lou.

689
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:12,881
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

690
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:14,633
I'll have it.

691
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:53,380
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.

692
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,670
What I want…

693
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:17,798
What's most important to me

694
01:26:20,551 --> 01:26:24,763
is that I have a guarantee.
No more attempts on my father's life.

695
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:29,601
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

696
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:33,230
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

697
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:35,149
I'm not that clever.

698
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:38,902
All I want is a truce.

699
01:26:45,451 --> 01:26:49,288
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?

700
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:53,167
When you got to go, you got to go.

701
01:26:58,672 --> 01:27:00,591
He's clean.

702
01:27:00,674 --> 01:27:02,760
Don't take too long.

703
01:27:05,888 --> 01:27:07,681
I've frisked a thousand punks.

704
01:31:58,305 --> 01:32:00,307
Okay, you take over.

705
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:19,409
I love you, Grandpa.

706
01:32:22,329 --> 01:32:25,040
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

707
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:29,461
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

708
01:32:29,586 --> 01:32:35,842
"I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

709
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:41,139
Go with your mother.

710
01:32:41,223 --> 01:32:43,350
Take them downstairs.

711
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:51,525
Go on, Carlo, you too.

712
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:54,945
Go on.

713
01:33:15,549 --> 01:33:19,553
- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.

714
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:41,158
Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.

715
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:47,789
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

716
01:33:47,873 --> 01:33:51,376
They hit us, so we hit them back.

717
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:56,756
Through our newspaper contacts
we've been able to put out material

718
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:01,136
about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo
in the drug rackets.

719
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:03,346
So things are loosening up.

720
01:34:04,598 --> 01:34:09,352
And I'm sending Fredo to Las Vegas,

721
01:34:09,436 --> 01:34:11,980
under the protection
of Don Francesco of L.A.

722
01:34:12,105 --> 01:34:16,610
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.

723
01:34:24,951 --> 01:34:26,745
Where's Michael?

724
01:34:39,049 --> 01:34:42,177
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

725
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:47,807
But he's safe. We're starting to work
to bring him back.

726
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:11,641
I want you to find out
where that old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

727
01:35:11,665 --> 01:35:13,625
I want him now.

728
01:35:17,337 --> 01:35:22,050
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

729
01:35:22,133 --> 01:35:28,139
- He must get better first. I'll decide…
- War is costly. We can't do business.

730
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:32,060
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.

731
01:35:32,185 --> 01:35:37,107
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

732
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:43,280
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
consigliere. I wouldn't be in this shape!

733
01:35:43,363 --> 01:35:45,657
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

734
01:35:49,244 --> 01:35:51,538
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

735
01:35:52,706 --> 01:35:55,667
Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

736
01:35:56,584 --> 01:36:00,964
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

737
01:36:01,047 --> 01:36:05,218
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

738
01:36:05,302 --> 01:36:08,638
That's because
they've started making big money.

739
01:36:08,722 --> 01:36:12,017
Papa never talked business
at the table.

740
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:15,979
- Shut up, Connie…
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

741
01:36:16,730 --> 01:36:17,814
Don't interfere.

742
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:24,029
I 'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family…

743
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:26,906
We don't discuss business at the table.

744
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:16,748
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

745
01:37:22,295 --> 01:37:24,297
Why are you so far
from the house?

746
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:27,634
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

747
01:37:27,717 --> 01:37:29,010
The bodyguards are here.

748
01:37:29,928 --> 01:37:31,262
It's still dangerous…

749
01:37:32,389 --> 01:37:34,140
We've heard from Santino
in New York…

750
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:37,811
Your enemies know you're here.

751
01:37:39,813 --> 01:37:41,564
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

752
01:37:42,232 --> 01:37:43,525
Not yet.

753
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:46,027
It's out of the question.

754
01:37:49,489 --> 01:37:50,907
Where are you going now?

755
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:53,618
To Corleone.

756
01:37:54,244 --> 01:37:55,495
Take my car.

757
01:37:58,832 --> 01:37:59,874
I want to walk.

758
01:38:02,502 --> 01:38:03,670
Be careful.

759
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:39,581
Where have all the men gone?

760
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:42,834
They're all dead from vendettas.

761
01:38:44,461 --> 01:38:46,880
There are the names of the dead.

762
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:07,400
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I.!

763
01:39:07,484 --> 01:39:11,779
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I.!
Clark Gable!

764
01:39:11,905 --> 01:39:17,160
America! Take me to the America, G. I.!
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

765
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:37,138
Mamma mia what a beauty.

766
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:48,399
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

767
01:39:54,614 --> 01:39:58,618
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

768
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:23,476
Did you have a good hunt?

769
01:40:24,435 --> 01:40:26,813
You know all the girls
around here?

770
01:40:27,313 --> 01:40:28,815
We saw some real beauties.

771
01:40:29,649 --> 01:40:33,152
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

772
01:40:36,364 --> 01:40:39,117
She would tempt the devil himself.

773
01:40:46,749 --> 01:40:48,918
Really put together.

774
01:40:49,002 --> 01:40:50,044
Right, Calo?

775
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:55,800
Such hair, such mouth!

776
01:40:58,177 --> 01:41:01,347
The girls around here are
beautiful… but virtuous.

777
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:04,267
This one had a purple dress…

778
01:41:04,642 --> 01:41:06,769
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

779
01:41:13,234 --> 01:41:15,069
Do you know her?

780
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:22,285
There's no girl like that
in this town.

781
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:26,205
My God, I understand!

782
01:41:30,335 --> 01:41:31,336
What's wrong?

783
01:41:33,546 --> 01:41:34,922
Let's go.

784
01:41:36,883 --> 01:41:38,134
It's his daughter.

785
01:41:38,593 --> 01:41:40,094
Tell him to come here.

786
01:41:43,514 --> 01:41:44,849
Call him.

787
01:42:04,911 --> 01:42:07,246
Fabrizio, you translate.

788
01:42:11,376 --> 01:42:13,252
I apologize if I offended you.

789
01:42:14,253 --> 01:42:17,674
I'm a stranger in this country.

790
01:42:17,757 --> 01:42:20,843
I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

791
01:42:26,307 --> 01:42:29,185
I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.

792
01:42:30,603 --> 01:42:32,939
My name is Michael Corleone.

793
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:39,112
There are people who'd pay
a lot of money for that information.

794
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:44,325
But then your daughter
would lose a father

795
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:48,287
instead of gaining a husband.

796
01:42:56,462 --> 01:42:58,673
I want to meet your daughter.

797
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:03,928
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.

798
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:06,264
With all respect.

799
01:43:12,311 --> 01:43:16,315
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

800
01:43:21,821 --> 01:43:23,322
What's her name?

801
01:46:18,664 --> 01:46:20,833
I'll knock you dizzy.

802
01:46:26,589 --> 01:46:28,674
Save it for the library.

803
01:46:32,345 --> 01:46:35,014
We've got to pick up my sister.

804
01:46:53,074 --> 01:46:54,784
What's the matter?

805
01:46:57,244 --> 01:46:59,038
What's the matter?

806
01:47:00,831 --> 01:47:02,750
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

807
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:06,003
It was my fault. I hit him.

808
01:47:06,087 --> 01:47:09,882
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me…

809
01:47:15,096 --> 01:47:18,391
I'm just going to get a doctor
to take a look at you.

810
01:47:18,474 --> 01:47:20,977
Sonny, please don't do anything.

811
01:47:22,937 --> 01:47:25,022
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

812
01:47:25,106 --> 01:47:27,984
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

813
01:47:32,530 --> 01:47:35,741
You spic slobs still betting Yankees?

814
01:47:35,825 --> 01:47:38,494
Tell them to stop taking in action.

815
01:47:39,328 --> 01:47:41,038
We lost enough money last week.

816
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:50,214
Come here, come here!

817
01:48:47,146 --> 01:48:50,483
If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you.

818
01:52:43,716 --> 01:52:47,970
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

819
01:52:48,053 --> 01:52:52,391
Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling.

820
01:52:52,474 --> 01:52:56,312
- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.

821
01:52:56,395 --> 01:52:58,939
All we know is that he's all right.

822
01:53:01,483 --> 01:53:05,112
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.

823
01:53:06,238 --> 01:53:10,367
Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.
Please?

824
01:53:11,910 --> 01:53:17,082
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

825
01:53:18,083 --> 01:53:19,960
He'll get in touch with you.

826
01:53:20,085 --> 01:53:23,756
I let my cab go,
so can I call another one, please?

827
01:53:23,839 --> 01:53:25,716
Come on. Sorry.

828
01:53:42,941 --> 01:53:47,613
<i>- Hello?
- Is Carlo there?</i>

829
01:53:48,405 --> 01:53:50,866
<i>- Who is this?
- A friend of Carlo.</i>

830
01:53:50,949 --> 01:53:54,328
<i>Tell him that I can't make it tonight
until later.</i>

831
01:54:00,084 --> 01:54:01,335
Bitch!

832
01:54:03,337 --> 01:54:06,131
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.

833
01:54:06,215 --> 01:54:09,551
- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.

834
01:54:09,635 --> 01:54:13,013
<i>- You just told me to make you dinner!
- Vafangool!</i>

835
01:54:13,222 --> 01:54:15,349
I'll vafangoolyou!

836
01:54:20,187 --> 01:54:22,981
She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.

837
01:54:27,319 --> 01:54:31,657
That's it, break it all,
you spoiled Guinea brat. Break it all!

838
01:54:40,874 --> 01:54:44,002
Why don't you bring
your whore home for dinner?

839
01:54:45,003 --> 01:54:46,672
Maybe I will.

840
01:54:53,429 --> 01:54:56,598
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

841
01:54:56,682 --> 01:55:00,602
You skinny, spoiled brat.
Clean it up! Clean it up!

842
01:55:00,686 --> 01:55:05,190
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!

843
01:55:05,274 --> 01:55:10,112
Clean it up. Clean that up, you…

844
01:55:13,365 --> 01:55:15,075
Clean it!

845
01:55:15,159 --> 01:55:19,413
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.
Be a murderer, like your father!

846
01:55:19,496 --> 01:55:22,958
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

847
01:55:23,041 --> 01:55:24,751
Come on, kill me!

848
01:55:26,295 --> 01:55:27,963
Get out of here!

849
01:55:28,046 --> 01:55:31,467
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

850
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:34,219
You Guinea brat. Get out of here!

851
01:55:44,688 --> 01:55:47,649
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

852
01:55:48,775 --> 01:55:51,820
Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.

853
01:55:51,904 --> 01:55:54,823
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

854
01:55:56,116 --> 01:55:57,910
Yeah, Connie.

855
01:56:02,581 --> 01:56:04,541
You wait there.

856
01:56:07,169 --> 01:56:09,713
No, you just wait there.

857
01:56:11,882 --> 01:56:14,134
Son -of-a -bitch.

858
01:56:14,218 --> 01:56:17,429
- Son -of-a -bitch!
- What's the matter?

859
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:24,686
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

860
01:56:32,694 --> 01:56:33,946
Sonny!

861
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:42,412
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!

862
01:56:43,497 --> 01:56:45,374
Go after him, go on!

863
01:57:15,112 --> 01:57:17,155
Son -of-a -bitch. Come on!

864
01:59:05,847 --> 01:59:07,683
Give me a drop.

865
01:59:16,108 --> 01:59:18,402
My wife is crying upstairs.

866
01:59:20,779 --> 01:59:23,281
I hear cars coming to the house.

867
01:59:27,953 --> 01:59:30,872
<i>Consigliere of mine,</i>

868
01:59:30,956 --> 01:59:34,459
tell your Don
what everyone seems to know.

869
01:59:34,543 --> 01:59:36,920
I didn't tell Mama anything.

870
01:59:37,879 --> 01:59:41,133
I was about to come up and wake you
and tell you.

871
01:59:44,636 --> 01:59:46,847
But you needed a drink first.

872
01:59:49,182 --> 01:59:50,434
Yeah.

873
01:59:53,729 --> 01:59:56,231
Well, now you've had your drink.

874
02:00:01,778 --> 02:00:05,657
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

875
02:00:22,716 --> 02:00:25,260
I want no inquiries made.

876
02:00:29,723 --> 02:00:32,267
I want no acts of vengeance.

877
02:00:33,977 --> 02:00:36,813
I want you to arrange a meeting

878
02:00:37,814 --> 02:00:40,442
with the heads of the five families.

879
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:44,446
This war stops now.

880
02:01:06,384 --> 02:01:08,929
Call Bonasera.

881
02:01:09,012 --> 02:01:11,181
I need him now.

882
02:01:23,568 --> 02:01:28,740
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling
for Vito Corleone, at his request.

883
02:01:28,824 --> 02:01:31,201
You owe your Don a service.

884
02:01:31,284 --> 02:01:34,830
<i>He has no doubt that you will repay it.</i>

885
02:01:34,913 --> 02:01:39,251
<i>He will be at your funeral parlor
in one hour. Be there to greet him.</i>

886
02:02:00,438 --> 02:02:05,235
Well, my friend, are you ready
to do me this service?

887
02:02:05,318 --> 02:02:08,405
Yes. What do you want me to do?

888
02:02:25,422 --> 02:02:28,341
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

889
02:02:44,357 --> 02:02:47,485
Look how they massacred my boy.

890
02:03:16,514 --> 02:03:19,768
It's safer to teach you English!

891
02:03:20,518 --> 02:03:21,937
I know English…

892
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:26,816
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

893
02:03:34,032 --> 02:03:35,825
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

894
02:03:36,534 --> 02:03:38,536
How are things in Palermo?

895
02:03:44,542 --> 02:03:48,588
Michael is teaching me to
drive… watch, I'll show you.

896
02:03:51,383 --> 02:03:53,218
How are things in Palermo?

897
02:03:53,593 --> 02:03:56,721
Young people don't respect
anything anymore…

898
02:03:57,806 --> 02:04:01,184
times are changing for the worse.

899
02:04:03,436 --> 02:04:06,856
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

900
02:04:09,567 --> 02:04:14,739
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa… right now.

901
02:04:20,745 --> 02:04:21,913
What's wrong?

902
02:04:23,039 --> 02:04:25,250
Bad news from America.

903
02:04:27,711 --> 02:04:31,423
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

904
02:04:38,013 --> 02:04:39,848
Let's go… you promised.

905
02:04:58,658 --> 02:04:59,659
Fabrizio!

906
02:04:59,743 --> 02:05:01,161
Get the car.

907
02:05:02,537 --> 02:05:06,708
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

908
02:05:06,791 --> 02:05:10,378
No, take her to her father's house
until things are safe.

909
02:05:10,462 --> 02:05:12,380
Okay, anything you say.

910
02:05:18,303 --> 02:05:20,055
Calo, where is Apollonia?

911
02:05:20,805 --> 02:05:24,309
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

912
02:05:26,603 --> 02:05:28,646
She'll make a good American wife.

913
02:05:30,106 --> 02:05:32,650
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

914
02:05:42,911 --> 02:05:45,080
Fabrizio!

915
02:05:45,163 --> 02:05:46,831
Where are you going?

916
02:05:48,541 --> 02:05:50,960
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

917
02:05:57,092 --> 02:05:58,510
No, Apollonia!

918
02:06:21,574 --> 02:06:27,413
Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organize this meeting,

919
02:06:27,539 --> 02:06:32,377
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

920
02:06:34,129 --> 02:06:37,257
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

921
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:40,677
and from Brooklyn

922
02:06:42,303 --> 02:06:44,389
Philip Tattaglia.

923
02:06:46,182 --> 02:06:48,893
And from Staten Island

924
02:06:48,977 --> 02:06:52,480
we have with us Victor Strachi.

925
02:06:52,564 --> 02:06:58,194
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

926
02:06:58,278 --> 02:07:02,031
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

927
02:07:08,872 --> 02:07:12,333
How did things ever get so far?

928
02:07:12,417 --> 02:07:14,043
I don't know.

929
02:07:16,087 --> 02:07:19,591
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

930
02:07:22,719 --> 02:07:26,139
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

931
02:07:28,600 --> 02:07:32,020
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

932
02:07:32,103 --> 02:07:36,107
then I'm willing to let things go on
as before.

933
02:07:37,567 --> 02:07:41,196
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

934
02:07:41,279 --> 02:07:46,659
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

935
02:07:46,743 --> 02:07:50,830
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

936
02:07:50,914 --> 02:07:55,126
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

937
02:07:55,210 --> 02:07:58,087
He refused to share them.

938
02:07:58,171 --> 02:08:01,966
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

939
02:08:02,050 --> 02:08:04,427
All of you know me.

940
02:08:05,345 --> 02:08:10,516
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

941
02:08:12,185 --> 02:08:18,024
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

942
02:08:18,107 --> 02:08:22,362
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

943
02:08:22,445 --> 02:08:28,409
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

944
02:08:28,534 --> 02:08:33,248
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

945
02:08:33,331 --> 02:08:37,543
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

946
02:08:37,627 --> 02:08:42,757
I believed that then
and I believe that now.

947
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:45,051
Times have changed.

948
02:08:45,176 --> 02:08:49,889
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

949
02:08:49,973 --> 02:08:52,850
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

950
02:08:52,934 --> 02:08:58,356
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

951
02:08:58,439 --> 02:09:03,027
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

952
02:09:04,112 --> 02:09:07,699
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

953
02:09:07,782 --> 02:09:10,368
After all, we're not communists.

954
02:09:13,496 --> 02:09:16,582
I also don't believe in drugs.

955
02:09:16,708 --> 02:09:21,546
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

956
02:09:21,629 --> 02:09:24,757
Somebody says to them
" I have powders."

957
02:09:24,841 --> 02:09:28,094
"If you put up
3 -4,000 dollar investment,

958
02:09:28,386 --> 02:09:31,180
we can make 50,000 distributing."

959
02:09:32,390 --> 02:09:38,313
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

960
02:09:38,396 --> 02:09:43,192
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

961
02:09:43,276 --> 02:09:45,069
<i>That's an infàmia.</i>

962
02:09:46,404 --> 02:09:50,325
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the colored.

963
02:09:50,408 --> 02:09:53,619
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

964
02:10:00,251 --> 02:10:03,838
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

965
02:10:05,256 --> 02:10:11,888
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

966
02:10:12,430 --> 02:10:17,018
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

967
02:10:17,101 --> 02:10:21,397
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

968
02:10:21,481 --> 02:10:25,234
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

969
02:10:25,318 --> 02:10:28,613
As time goes by
and his position becomes stronger,

970
02:10:28,696 --> 02:10:31,366
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

971
02:10:31,449 --> 02:10:36,579
We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

972
02:10:36,662 --> 02:10:39,540
You talk about vengeance.

973
02:10:39,624 --> 02:10:42,877
Will vengeance
bring your son back to you?

974
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:45,505
Or my boy to me?

975
02:10:45,588 --> 02:10:48,383
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

976
02:10:51,177 --> 02:10:53,471
But I have selfish reasons.

977
02:10:55,765 --> 02:10:59,352
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country

978
02:11:01,229 --> 02:11:03,773
because of this Sollozzo business.

979
02:11:05,316 --> 02:11:09,237
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

980
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:11,989
Cleared of all these false charges.

981
02:11:13,408 --> 02:11:16,536
But I'm a superstitious man.

982
02:11:16,661 --> 02:11:21,958
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer¤,

983
02:11:23,334 --> 02:11:26,921
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

984
02:11:27,004 --> 02:11:29,882
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

985
02:11:31,175 --> 02:11:34,762
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

986
02:11:36,431 --> 02:11:38,766
And that I do not forgive.

987
02:11:41,227 --> 02:11:43,604
But, that aside

988
02:11:46,691 --> 02:11:49,026
let me say that I swear

989
02:11:50,653 --> 02:11:53,781
on the souls of my grandchildren,

990
02:11:53,865 --> 02:11:58,244
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

991
02:12:23,728 --> 02:12:29,192
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

992
02:12:29,275 --> 02:12:31,402
Mention it. Don't insist.

993
02:12:33,404 --> 02:12:38,326
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

994
02:12:39,952 --> 02:12:41,913
Tattaglia's a pimp.

995
02:12:42,997 --> 02:12:46,125
He could never have outfought Santino.

996
02:12:48,503 --> 02:12:54,091
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

997
02:13:09,565 --> 02:13:11,651
Come on, Nancy.

998
02:13:12,860 --> 02:13:15,446
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

999
02:13:16,781 --> 02:13:18,449
Okay, all right.

1000
02:13:31,546 --> 02:13:33,756
How long have you been back?

1001
02:13:34,549 --> 02:13:36,384
I've been back a year.

1002
02:13:37,802 --> 02:13:39,929
Longer than that, I think.

1003
02:13:42,765 --> 02:13:44,934
It's good to see you, Kay.

1004
02:13:55,987 --> 02:13:58,531
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1005
02:14:01,033 --> 02:14:04,036
He's been sick. Very sick.

1006
02:14:05,580 --> 02:14:07,540
But you're not like him.

1007
02:14:07,623 --> 02:14:11,419
You told me you weren't going to
become like your father.

1008
02:14:13,337 --> 02:14:17,633
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1009
02:14:17,717 --> 02:14:21,178
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1010
02:14:22,388 --> 02:14:24,807
Like a senator or president.

1011
02:14:24,890 --> 02:14:27,351
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

1012
02:14:27,435 --> 02:14:30,271
They don't have men killed.

1013
02:14:33,691 --> 02:14:35,693
Who's being naive, Kay?

1014
02:14:36,944 --> 02:14:41,198
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

1015
02:14:42,742 --> 02:14:47,121
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

1016
02:14:48,956 --> 02:14:52,918
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay…

1017
02:14:54,378 --> 02:14:57,506
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1018
02:14:58,799 --> 02:15:03,638
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1019
02:15:03,721 --> 02:15:07,224
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1020
02:15:07,308 --> 02:15:11,145
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because… I want you to marry me.

1021
02:15:12,855 --> 02:15:15,441
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay…

1022
02:15:17,193 --> 02:15:21,072
I'll do anything you ask
to make up for what's happened to us.

1023
02:15:22,740 --> 02:15:26,994
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that

1024
02:15:28,537 --> 02:15:31,791
we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1025
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:36,087
That we have children. Our children.

1026
02:15:37,588 --> 02:15:39,757
Kay, I need you.

1027
02:15:41,717 --> 02:15:43,302
And I love you.

1028
02:16:05,449 --> 02:16:09,203
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

1029
02:16:09,328 --> 02:16:12,957
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

1030
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:16,168
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1031
02:16:16,252 --> 02:16:19,380
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

1032
02:16:19,463 --> 02:16:22,925
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

1033
02:16:23,008 --> 02:16:26,887
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

1034
02:16:28,389 --> 02:16:30,558
Don Corleone…

1035
02:16:30,641 --> 02:16:34,770
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1036
02:16:34,854 --> 02:16:38,899
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1037
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:42,570
Michael is now head of the family.

1038
02:16:42,653 --> 02:16:46,949
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1039
02:16:47,032 --> 02:16:49,410
After we make the move to Nevada

1040
02:16:49,493 --> 02:16:53,914
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1041
02:16:53,998 --> 02:16:58,335
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

1042
02:16:58,419 --> 02:17:01,672
Forgive me, but with you gone,

1043
02:17:01,756 --> 02:17:04,592
me and Pete
will come under Barzini's thumb.

1044
02:17:04,675 --> 02:17:10,347
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1045
02:17:10,431 --> 02:17:13,350
- Do you have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1046
02:17:13,434 --> 02:17:16,353
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

1047
02:17:16,437 --> 02:17:19,690
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1048
02:17:24,612 --> 02:17:29,950
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1049
02:17:30,034 --> 02:17:32,369
That's all I can tell you now.

1050
02:17:33,204 --> 02:17:35,790
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1051
02:17:35,873 --> 02:17:39,251
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right -hand man.

1052
02:17:39,335 --> 02:17:44,131
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1053
02:17:44,215 --> 02:17:46,759
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1054
02:17:46,842 --> 02:17:51,555
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1055
02:18:11,575 --> 02:18:15,412
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1056
02:18:15,496 --> 02:18:18,415
Mike… Why am I out?

1057
02:18:19,917 --> 02:18:22,628
You're not a wartime consigliere. Tom.

1058
02:18:23,921 --> 02:18:27,174
Things may get rough with the move.

1059
02:18:27,258 --> 02:18:28,551
Tom.

1060
02:18:33,722 --> 02:18:38,894
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1061
02:18:38,978 --> 02:18:43,107
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

1062
02:18:44,567 --> 02:18:47,778
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1063
02:18:48,779 --> 02:18:53,742
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

1064
02:18:54,785 --> 02:18:57,830
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

1065
02:19:47,004 --> 02:19:51,300
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

1066
02:19:51,425 --> 02:19:56,013
This doctor did some job.
Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

1067
02:19:56,096 --> 02:20:00,225
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

1068
02:20:00,309 --> 02:20:02,686
Let me open the door, all right?

1069
02:20:08,859 --> 02:20:14,281
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

1070
02:20:14,365 --> 02:20:16,992
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

1071
02:20:20,913 --> 02:20:23,999
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

1072
02:20:25,209 --> 02:20:28,712
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

1073
02:20:30,130 --> 02:20:33,550
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.

1074
02:20:35,094 --> 02:20:39,765
- Hey, Mike…
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

1075
02:20:39,848 --> 02:20:42,518
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

1076
02:20:48,399 --> 02:20:51,694
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

1077
02:20:51,777 --> 02:20:53,904
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

1078
02:20:55,614 --> 02:20:57,741
Hey, come on! Scram!

1079
02:20:59,410 --> 02:21:02,955
Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

1080
02:21:03,038 --> 02:21:04,331
Sorry.

1081
02:21:06,291 --> 02:21:08,836
I don't know. He's tired.

1082
02:21:19,013 --> 02:21:23,350
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

1083
02:21:23,434 --> 02:21:25,394
Well, give him a call.

1084
02:21:26,770 --> 02:21:29,898
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

1085
02:21:29,982 --> 02:21:32,192
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

1086
02:21:32,276 --> 02:21:35,863
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1087
02:21:35,946 --> 02:21:38,198
Well, I owe it all to him.

1088
02:21:39,408 --> 02:21:40,993
He knows how grateful you are.

1089
02:21:41,076 --> 02:21:44,329
That's why
he'd like to ask a favor of you.

1090
02:21:44,413 --> 02:21:46,331
Mike, what can I do?

1091
02:21:47,499 --> 02:21:49,960
We're thinking of giving up our interests

1092
02:21:50,044 --> 02:21:52,963
in the olive oil business
and settling here.

1093
02:21:53,797 --> 02:21:59,136
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.

1094
02:21:59,219 --> 02:22:01,972
- Tom!
- Are you sure?

1095
02:22:02,056 --> 02:22:05,059
Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

1096
02:22:05,142 --> 02:22:07,853
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1097
02:22:09,146 --> 02:22:11,565
See, Johnny…

1098
02:22:11,648 --> 02:22:15,861
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

1099
02:22:15,944 --> 02:22:19,698
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1100
02:22:22,618 --> 02:22:27,247
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1101
02:22:28,499 --> 02:22:30,626
We're counting on you.

1102
02:22:32,628 --> 02:22:36,298
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

1103
02:22:36,381 --> 02:22:37,674
Good.

1104
02:22:39,301 --> 02:22:43,931
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

1105
02:22:44,014 --> 02:22:46,558
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

1106
02:22:46,683 --> 02:22:51,772
Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

1107
02:22:51,855 --> 02:22:55,442
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

1108
02:22:58,112 --> 02:23:00,864
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

1109
02:23:02,616 --> 02:23:04,451
Buy me out?

1110
02:23:04,535 --> 02:23:07,121
The casino, the hotel.

1111
02:23:07,204 --> 02:23:10,124
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1112
02:23:10,207 --> 02:23:15,629
The Corleone family wants
to buy me out? No, I buy you out.

1113
02:23:15,712 --> 02:23:19,133
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

1114
02:23:19,216 --> 02:23:23,095
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

1115
02:23:27,891 --> 02:23:30,310
You Guineas make me laugh.

1116
02:23:30,435 --> 02:23:35,023
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

1117
02:23:36,400 --> 02:23:39,820
You did that
because we bankrolled your casino

1118
02:23:39,903 --> 02:23:45,159
and the Molinari family guaranteed
his safety. Let's talk business.

1119
02:23:45,242 --> 02:23:47,995
Yes. First of all, you're all done.

1120
02:23:48,078 --> 02:23:50,539
You don't have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1121
02:23:50,664 --> 02:23:55,043
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

1122
02:23:55,127 --> 02:23:59,047
Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

1123
02:23:59,131 --> 02:24:04,178
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1124
02:24:04,261 --> 02:24:07,764
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

1125
02:24:07,848 --> 02:24:12,686
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

1126
02:24:12,769 --> 02:24:16,982
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1127
02:24:17,065 --> 02:24:21,820
I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.

1128
02:24:25,866 --> 02:24:28,702
You straightened my brother out?

1129
02:24:28,785 --> 02:24:33,248
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

1130
02:24:33,332 --> 02:24:35,292
What's wrong with you?

1131
02:24:40,172 --> 02:24:43,300
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1132
02:24:44,218 --> 02:24:45,844
Son -of-a -bitch!

1133
02:24:45,928 --> 02:24:51,099
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

1134
02:24:51,183 --> 02:24:53,685
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

1135
02:24:54,811 --> 02:24:58,357
<i>Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don…</i>

1136
02:24:58,482 --> 02:25:03,862
Just a minute. Don is semi -retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

1137
02:25:03,946 --> 02:25:07,282
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1138
02:25:12,162 --> 02:25:17,000
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1139
02:25:17,751 --> 02:25:18,961
Fredo…

1140
02:25:20,170 --> 02:25:22,923
You're my older brother, and I love you.

1141
02:25:24,383 --> 02:25:28,387
But don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

1142
02:25:29,888 --> 02:25:30,889
Ever.

1143
02:25:39,022 --> 02:25:43,193
I have to see my father and his people,
so have dinner without me.

1144
02:25:44,945 --> 02:25:49,825
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

1145
02:25:57,207 --> 02:26:00,252
Your sister wants to ask you something.

1146
02:26:00,335 --> 02:26:02,462
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

1147
02:26:02,546 --> 02:26:05,507
They want you to be godfather
to their boy.

1148
02:26:05,590 --> 02:26:07,426
- We'll see.
- Will you?

1149
02:26:07,509 --> 02:26:09,845
Let me think about it. Come on.

1150
02:26:18,729 --> 02:26:21,606
Barzini will move against you first.

1151
02:26:21,690 --> 02:26:26,111
He'll set up a meeting with someone
you absolutely trust.

1152
02:26:26,194 --> 02:26:28,238
Guaranteeing your safety.

1153
02:26:29,489 --> 02:26:32,576
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

1154
02:26:37,289 --> 02:26:40,292
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

1155
02:26:41,710 --> 02:26:45,213
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

1156
02:26:50,260 --> 02:26:51,762
I don't know.

1157
02:26:53,805 --> 02:26:56,725
Are you happy with your wife
and children?

1158
02:26:57,684 --> 02:27:00,520
- Very happy.
- That's good.

1159
02:27:02,397 --> 02:27:07,277
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

1160
02:27:07,361 --> 02:27:10,322
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

1161
02:27:11,782 --> 02:27:14,785
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

1162
02:27:16,328 --> 02:27:19,790
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1163
02:27:23,126 --> 02:27:25,462
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1164
02:27:25,587 --> 02:27:28,298
He looks more like you every day.

1165
02:27:31,009 --> 02:27:35,472
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

1166
02:27:37,599 --> 02:27:39,643
Read the funny papers.

1167
02:27:46,858 --> 02:27:52,489
I want you to arrange for a telephone
man to check all in - and out -going calls.

1168
02:27:52,614 --> 02:27:57,911
- I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.
- That's right. I forgot.

1169
02:28:01,957 --> 02:28:03,667
What's the matter?

1170
02:28:04,501 --> 02:28:06,545
What's bothering you?

1171
02:28:10,132 --> 02:28:14,761
I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it,
so I'll handle it.

1172
02:28:28,024 --> 02:28:32,529
I knew that Santino
would have to go through all this.

1173
02:28:32,612 --> 02:28:34,239
And Fredo…

1174
02:28:36,950 --> 02:28:38,994
Fredo was, well…

1175
02:28:40,871 --> 02:28:43,707
But I never wanted this for you.

1176
02:28:46,042 --> 02:28:51,089
I worked my whole life. I don't apologize
for taking care of my family.

1177
02:28:51,173 --> 02:28:55,093
And I refused to be a fool,

1178
02:28:55,177 --> 02:28:59,306
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1179
02:29:01,266 --> 02:29:04,728
I don't apologize. That's my life,
but I thought that,

1180
02:29:06,396 --> 02:29:11,568
that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

1181
02:29:13,361 --> 02:29:19,034
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

1182
02:29:19,117 --> 02:29:22,120
<i>Another pezzonovante.</i>

1183
02:29:22,204 --> 02:29:23,872
Well…

1184
02:29:27,083 --> 02:29:31,004
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1185
02:29:31,087 --> 02:29:34,591
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.

1186
02:29:39,429 --> 02:29:43,892
Now listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting,

1187
02:29:43,975 --> 02:29:46,937
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

1188
02:30:03,912 --> 02:30:06,039
Can I hold it, please?

1189
02:30:21,137 --> 02:30:25,016
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

1190
02:30:25,100 --> 02:30:27,894
Over here, over here.

1191
02:30:29,771 --> 02:30:32,274
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1192
02:30:38,655 --> 02:30:40,407
Anthony!

1193
02:30:40,490 --> 02:30:42,158
Come here, come here.

1194
02:30:47,330 --> 02:30:50,000
That's it. We'll put it right there.

1195
02:30:55,213 --> 02:30:57,799
I'll show you something. Come here.

1196
02:30:59,843 --> 02:31:01,720
Stand there.

1197
02:31:05,473 --> 02:31:07,225
Give me an orange!

1198
02:31:25,577 --> 02:31:27,370
That's a new trick.

1199
02:31:28,371 --> 02:31:30,707
You run in there. Run in there.

1200
02:31:44,262 --> 02:31:46,222
Where are you?

1201
02:34:43,900 --> 02:34:46,277
Mike, can I have a minute?

1202
02:34:56,371 --> 02:34:58,832
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1203
02:34:58,915 --> 02:35:02,210
He says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

1204
02:35:02,877 --> 02:35:05,088
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1205
02:35:06,422 --> 02:35:10,218
I can arrange security. On my territory.

1206
02:35:13,263 --> 02:35:15,807
- All right?
- All right.

1207
02:35:33,324 --> 02:35:36,286
Do you know
how they're going to come at you?

1208
02:35:38,788 --> 02:35:42,458
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.

1209
02:35:44,627 --> 02:35:46,421
Where I'll be safe.

1210
02:35:58,683 --> 02:36:02,270
I always thought it would be Clemenza,
not Tessio.

1211
02:36:02,353 --> 02:36:06,149
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

1212
02:36:08,401 --> 02:36:09,694
But I'm going to wait.

1213
02:36:10,361 --> 02:36:11,362
After the baptism.

1214
02:36:15,241 --> 02:36:18,828
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1215
02:36:18,912 --> 02:36:23,082
And then I'll meet
with Don Barzini and Tattaglia.

1216
02:36:24,667 --> 02:36:27,629
All the heads of the five families.

1217
02:38:48,603 --> 02:38:53,566
Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?

1218
02:38:53,649 --> 02:38:54,817
I do.

1219
02:38:54,901 --> 02:38:58,404
<i>Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?</i>

1220
02:38:58,488 --> 02:38:59,489
<i>I do.</i>

1221
02:38:59,572 --> 02:39:03,618
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?</i>

1222
02:39:03,701 --> 02:39:04,994
<i>I do.</i>

1223
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:14,897
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1224
02:40:21,154 --> 02:40:22,405
I do renounce him.

1225
02:40:32,081 --> 02:40:33,499
And all his works?

1226
02:40:47,388 --> 02:40:48,431
I do renounce them.

1227
02:40:50,183 --> 02:40:51,434
Oh, God!

1228
02:40:54,353 --> 02:40:58,024
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1229
02:41:18,085 --> 02:41:19,295
I will.

1230
02:41:26,427 --> 02:41:31,933
Michael Rizzi, go in peace,
and may the Lord be with you. Amen.

1231
02:41:46,155 --> 02:41:48,074
Kay!

1232
02:41:48,157 --> 02:41:50,117
Kiss your godfather.

1233
02:42:14,517 --> 02:42:18,604
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

1234
02:42:18,688 --> 02:42:20,356
Everybody has to leave without us.

1235
02:42:20,439 --> 02:42:23,401
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.

1236
02:42:23,526 --> 02:42:27,029
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

1237
02:42:28,155 --> 02:42:30,533
I'll only be a couple of days.

1238
02:42:46,799 --> 02:42:49,010
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1239
02:42:51,178 --> 02:42:54,932
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

1240
02:43:02,732 --> 02:43:08,154
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.

1241
02:43:08,237 --> 02:43:11,782
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

1242
02:43:11,866 --> 02:43:14,035
I can't go either, Sal.

1243
02:43:26,005 --> 02:43:29,925
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

1244
02:43:31,594 --> 02:43:34,430
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1245
02:43:40,436 --> 02:43:42,897
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1246
02:43:44,065 --> 02:43:47,234
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.

1247
02:44:32,655 --> 02:44:35,491
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

1248
02:44:40,371 --> 02:44:44,291
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

1249
02:44:45,334 --> 02:44:49,255
That little farce
you played with my sister.

1250
02:44:49,338 --> 02:44:54,427
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

1251
02:44:54,510 --> 02:44:57,221
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.

1252
02:44:59,890 --> 02:45:02,184
Don't do this to me, please.

1253
02:45:11,444 --> 02:45:13,195
Barzini is dead.

1254
02:45:15,322 --> 02:45:17,658
So is Philip Tattaglia.

1255
02:45:18,868 --> 02:45:20,369
Moe Greene.

1256
02:45:21,328 --> 02:45:25,124
Strachi. Cuneo.

1257
02:45:27,084 --> 02:45:32,339
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1258
02:45:32,423 --> 02:45:34,216
Admit what you did.

1259
02:45:38,137 --> 02:45:39,805
Get him a drink.

1260
02:45:46,103 --> 02:45:47,396
Come on.

1261
02:45:48,731 --> 02:45:51,150
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1262
02:45:51,233 --> 02:45:54,111
Do you think
I 'd make my sister a widow?

1263
02:45:55,237 --> 02:45:57,948
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1264
02:46:04,872 --> 02:46:06,916
Go ahead, drink, drink.

1265
02:46:11,712 --> 02:46:15,549
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

1266
02:46:16,634 --> 02:46:20,596
You're finished.
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1267
02:46:20,679 --> 02:46:22,306
Tom.

1268
02:46:26,435 --> 02:46:30,022
I want you to stay there. Understand?

1269
02:46:30,105 --> 02:46:32,691
Only don't tell me you're innocent.

1270
02:46:33,943 --> 02:46:38,197
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

1271
02:46:42,451 --> 02:46:44,495
Who approached you?

1272
02:46:45,788 --> 02:46:47,998
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1273
02:46:55,881 --> 02:46:57,591
It was Barzini.

1274
02:47:01,720 --> 02:47:03,305
Good.

1275
02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:13,566
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

1276
02:47:13,649 --> 02:47:17,194
I'll call your wife
and tell her what flight you're on.

1277
02:47:21,490 --> 02:47:24,034
- Mike…
- Get out of my sight.

1278
02:47:50,185 --> 02:47:51,812
Hello, Carlo.

1279
02:48:51,664 --> 02:48:54,792
- I'm trying to tell you…
- Mama, please!

1280
02:49:03,175 --> 02:49:05,260
Michael!

1281
02:49:05,344 --> 02:49:07,346
- What is it?
- Where is he?

1282
02:49:09,765 --> 02:49:14,895
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

1283
02:49:14,978 --> 02:49:19,066
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

1284
02:49:19,149 --> 02:49:22,236
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

1285
02:49:22,319 --> 02:49:28,117
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

1286
02:49:28,200 --> 02:49:29,827
Connie.

1287
02:49:32,079 --> 02:49:34,790
Why do you think
he kept Carlo at the Mall?

1288
02:49:34,873 --> 02:49:37,710
He knew he was going to kill him.

1289
02:49:37,793 --> 02:49:43,132
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold -hearted bastard!

1290
02:49:43,215 --> 02:49:47,302
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

1291
02:49:47,386 --> 02:49:50,139
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

1292
02:49:59,815 --> 02:50:04,027
No! No, no…

1293
02:50:04,111 --> 02:50:07,489
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

1294
02:50:28,635 --> 02:50:30,345
She's hysterical.

1295
02:50:34,892 --> 02:50:36,643
Hysterical.

1296
02:50:38,645 --> 02:50:40,355
Michael, is it true?

1297
02:50:42,357 --> 02:50:46,028
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

1298
02:50:46,111 --> 02:50:48,864
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

1299
02:51:08,926 --> 02:51:10,427
All right.

1300
02:51:13,263 --> 02:51:15,015
This one time.

1301
02:51:18,977 --> 02:51:22,314
This one time
I'll let you ask me about my affairs.

1302
02:51:28,403 --> 02:51:29,822
Is it true?

1303
02:51:33,909 --> 02:51:35,410
Is it?

1304
02:51:37,162 --> 02:51:38,539
No.

1305
02:51:52,469 --> 02:51:55,430
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

1306
02:52:26,712 --> 02:52:28,422
Don Corleone.

1307
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:43,500
