no door must be opened...

82
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,359
without the previous one
being closed first.

83
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,680
It is vital
that you remember this.

It's not as easy
as it may seem.

There are 15 different keys
for all of the 50 doors...

86
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,641
depending on which area of
the house you're in at the time.

87
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,270
Mrs. Mills,
from tomorrow onwards...

88
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,815
I will be leaving
a set of keys in your charge.

00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,316
The music room.

91
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,682
That old piano was already here
when we moved in.

Please do not let
the children thump away on it.

that we prize...

very highly in this house.

96
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,859
That is why you will not find
a telephone, a radio...

97
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,299
or anything else
that makes a racket.

98

Oh, we don't have
electricity, either.

99
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,971
During the war, the Germans
kept cutting it off...

100
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,576
so we learned to live
without it. Let's continue.

00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,898
Just like Daddy.

164
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,502
Daddy is coming back, though.

165
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:42,700
<i>Mrs. Mills, our father's</i>
<i>fighting in a war in France.</i>

166
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,037
<i>NICHOLAS: It's the World War.</i>

167
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,974
I know, but he's in France.

168
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,544
That's enough, chatterboxes.

169
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,377
Finish up your breakfasts.

170
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,974
Are you going to leave us, too?

171
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:57,351
Of course not!

172
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,151
<i>Why should I leave you?</i>

173
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,486
The others
said they wouldn't...

174
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,289
but they did,
and then it happened.

175
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,260
Be quiet!

176
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,557
What do you mean, Anne?

177
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,795
What happened?

178
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:16,103
Mummy went... mad.

179
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,837
- Nothing happened.
- Yes, it did.

180
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,809
- No, it didn't!
- Yes, it did!

181
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,107
<i>GRACE: Be quiet.</i>

182
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,884
What's going on?
I want those plates empty...

183
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,318
in less than a minute.
Is that clear?

184
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,921
Mrs. Mills, would you
come outside a moment?

185
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,020
I'd like a word with you.

186
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,232
Yes, ma'am.

187
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:49,135
The postman usually
comes every Wednesday.

188
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,607
But I just checked
the letterbox...

189
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,940
and this week he hasn't.

190
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,876
I'm afraid
I don't follow, ma'am.

191
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,005
This letter
should have been collected...

192
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,385
and delivered to
the newspaper five days ago.

193
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,784
It's an advertisement
for servants.

194
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,347
Since it was never published...

195
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,117
would you explain
what you're doing here?

196
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:08,055
Oh, I understand.

197
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,254
Ma'am, that's what
I was going to say to you...

198
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,797
when you
opened the door to us.

199
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,366
The truth is
that we just come by...

200
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,698
on the off chance.

201
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,260
A big house like this...

202
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,896
is always in need of someone
who knows the ropes.

203
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,840
You've served in a house
like this one before?

204
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,502
<i>This may come as a surprise</i>
<i>to you, ma'am, but...</i>

205
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,310
we, in fact,
used to work here.

206
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,845
Here?

207
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,413
Oh, now,
'twas a few years ago.

208
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,391
If you don't mind
my saying so, ma'am...

209
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,155
they were the best years
of my life.

210
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:48,562
That's why we come by,
because this house...

211
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,430
means a lot to us.

212
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,595
<i>Perhaps I'd best show you</i>
<i>our references, ma'am.</i>

213
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,730
No, no, no.

214
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,399
Don't bother.
There's no need.

215
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,635
So you say
you know the house well?

216
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,375
<i>MRS. MILLS:</i>
<i>Like the back of my hand.</i>

That is assuming the walls
haven't sprouted legs...

218
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,274
and moved in the meantime.

But it changes everything.

221
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,356
It's rather difficult,
to say the least.

222
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:26,898
One might
almost say... unbearable.

223
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,575
The only way of enduring it
is by keeping a cool head.

224
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,976
Oh, yes, ma'am.

225
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,640
I don't like fantasies.

226
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,047
Strange ideas.
Do you know what I mean?

227
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,212
I think so, ma'am.

228
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:47,282
My children sometimes
have strange ideas.

229
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,995
But you mustn't pay
any attention to them.

<i>Children will be children.</i>

231

Well, what?

250

Those children
were really stupid.

00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,430
Why?

252
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,142
Because they said
they only believed in Jesus...

253
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:12,667
and then
they got killed for it.

00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,410
And what would you have done,
deny Christ?

<i>ANNE: Well, yes.</i>

256

Inside I would have
believed in him...

00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,581
but I wouldn't have told
the Romans that.

Is that what you think, too,

I see.

260
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,125
So you would have lied
to the point of denying Christ.

261
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,760
You'd have saved
your heads from the Romans...

262
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,462
that's true.

go and call Mr. Tuttle.

00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:48,681
What's happening, ma'am?

803
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,376
Come on!

804
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:01,730
Oh, my God.

805
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,527
Ohh!

806
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,500
I checked that room myself.

807
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:10,536
It was empty.

808
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,438
Take these tablets, ma'am.

809
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:15,272
They'll do you good.

810
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:18,643
And yet I felt as if
there was someone else there.

811
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:22,378
<i>And it wasn't human.</i>

812
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,716
<i>There is something</i>
<i>in this house.</i>

813
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:27,586
<i>Something diabolic.</i>

814
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:29,157
Ma'am...

815
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:32,126
Something which is not...

816
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,659
not at rest.

817
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,894
[Sighs]

818
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,530
I know you don't believe it.

819
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:45,232
You don't believe it, do you?

820
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:46,707
I don't blame you.

821
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:50,906
<i>I used to not believe</i>
<i>these things.</i>

822
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:51,913
[Sighs]

823
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:55,475
I do believe it, ma'am.

824
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,348
I've always believed
in those things.

825
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,654
They're not easy to explain...

826
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,455
but they do happen.

827
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:09,293
<i>We've all heard stories</i>
<i>of... the beyond...</i>

828
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:12,527
now and then...

829
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:19,474
and I think sometimes
the world of the dead...

830
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:23,306
gets mixed up
with the world of the living.

831
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:26,473
But it's impossible.

832
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,882
The Lord would never allow
such an aberration.

833
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:29,918
The living and the dead...

834
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:34,024
will only meet
at the end of eternity.

835
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:36,618
It says so in the Bible.

836
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:39,427
Ma'am...

837
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:44,228
there isn't always
an answer for everything.

838

<i>MRS. MILLS:</i>
<i>Where are you off to, ma'am?</i>

840
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,177
I'm going to the village
to pay Father McGraw a visit.

841
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,452
If he won't come here,
then I shall go to him.

842
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:03,612
I shall bring him back.

843
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,913
Ma'am, you should wait
till the weather improves.

844
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,684
<i>GRACE:</i>
<i>I've waited long enough.</i>

845
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:10,019
Ma'am,
the priest told me that...

846
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:12,220
GRACE: I don't care
what he told you!

847
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,388
I want him to tell me
personally!

848
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,988
He must come today!

849
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:17,794
MRS. MILLS: But what are you
going to tell him?

850
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:20,596
GRACE: That we have searched
every room inch by inch...

851
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:23,297
and now I need them
to be blessed.

854
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,675
- Mr. Tuttle.
- Morning, ma'am.

855
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:33,739
I need you to search
the garden for gravestones.

856
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:34,977
Gravestones?

857
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:36,484
Yes. When my husband
bought this house...

858
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,247
we were told
there was a little cemetery.

859
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:40,686
I think it was over there,
amongst the trees.

860
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:41,882
I've not seen anything.

861
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:45,121
Check carefully.
It could be overgrown.

862
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:46,355
Yes, ma'am.

863
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,761
I need to know if there was
a family buried here...

864
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:51,459
and if they had
a little boy... Victor.

[Gate squeaking]

Now she thinks
the house is haunted.

867
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,817
Do you think
it's safe to let her go?

868
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:13,786
Oh, don't worry.

869
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:16,152
The fog won't let her
get very far.

870
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:17,716
Oh, yes, the fog.

871
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:20,295
The fog, of course.

872
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:21,921
And when do you think...

873
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:25,330
we should bring
all this out into the open?

874
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,232
All in good time, Mr. Tuttle.

875
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,770
All in good time.

876
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,433
Speaking of which.
