1
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:02,938
<i>Last season on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:05,298
<i>Hi, Mom and Dad.
If you're watching this,</i>

3
00:00:05,382 --> 00:00:06,800
<i>it means that something went wrong.</i>

4
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:08,009
What's happening?

5
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:09,719
A new timeline is setting in.

6
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:12,097
- Thank you for everything.
- We love you.

7
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:17,491
<i>Look, Kamilla, I don't want
to keep this from you anymore.</i>

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,355
If being Vibe
is a part of the life you want,

9
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:21,916
I would never get in the way of that.

10
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,856
<i>I want to take the cure.</i>

11
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:25,276
Killer Frost and I
are really gonna miss Vibe.

12
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:26,402
<i>Me too.</i>

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:28,278
Dad.

14
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:31,116
I'd like my replacement to be you, Joe.

15
00:00:31,408 --> 00:00:33,410
- As captain?
- Captain Joe West.

16
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:35,995
None of you can stop
what's been set into motion.

17
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:40,875
<i>Because nothing you can do
can alter what's about to happen.</i>

18
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,716
It's a system-wide power surge.

19
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:54,514
It's coming from the time vault.

20
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,812
- Are we under attack?
- I don't know.

21
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:03,273
Whatever's going on started
the moment we left.

22
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:06,484
<i>I wasn't perfect.</i>

23
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:09,821
<i>Please remember that I love you both.</i>

24
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:12,449
<i>And I always will. And I always will.</i>

25
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,367
<i>And I always will. Always will...</i>

26
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:26,755
Barry, Nora's message.

27
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:36,306
Why is it every time I come to visit,
there's always a crisis?

28
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:37,932
Comes with the meta territory.

29
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:40,894
750 mph, he's getting faster.

30
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:44,189
- Who is this guy, anyway?
- An old family friend.

31
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,862
<i>His name's Godspeed,
and he's from the future.</i>

32
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:55,033
He's like a fake speedster.

33
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:56,116
What's that?

34
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:00,789
The real deal.

35
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:18,473
Kick his butt, Barry.

36
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,517
Done and done-r.

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,280
Who are you, and
what are you doing in Central City?

38
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:47,252
He's just like the others.
No language skills, just noise.

39
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:48,502
Lovely.

40
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:49,546
What was that?

41
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:51,798
The fourth Godspeed
we've caught this summer,

42
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:54,050
and still no sign of Mr. August Heart.

43
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:55,253
Just another dummy who can't

44
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,303
communicate anything beyond modem speak.

45
00:02:57,387 --> 00:02:58,847
All right. I'm clocking out.

46
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:02,350
Why don't you drop off G4
at Iron Heights, Barry.

47
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:05,103
I don't think we're figuring out
this mystery today.

48
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:10,417
This is nice, Dad.
We should do this way more often.

49
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:11,359
Agreed.

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,320
Hey, before I forget,
congratulations on <i>The Citizen.</i>

51
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:17,532
Yeah, well, you know, there's
millions of people in Central City,

52
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:20,368
and I've only got a couple hundred
thousand subscribers, you know?

53
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:21,494
I'm no CCPN.

54
00:03:21,578 --> 00:03:23,705
Well, not yet. But in about ten years,

55
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:25,832
you'll be
a Pulitzer Prize-winning empire.

56
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:27,208
Baby steps, Dad.

57
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:30,461
Damn, this is good.

58
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:32,255
You know, you can't get drunk.

59
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:34,018
I don't even care,
that's how good this is.

60
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,259
Never fear, the party's here!

61
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:40,889
We brought my famous ambrosia salad,
and veggie dogs for Ralph.

62
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:44,392
- Guys, Ralph's still in Peru.
- Or Monaco. Or Texas?

63
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:47,312
All that for a Missing Persons case?
That's dedication.

64
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:49,939
Guys, guys, what are we doing?

65
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:53,484
Baby Jenna's napping
like a little angel,

66
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:57,113
and I have creamed corn, I have
candied yams, I have collard greens.

67
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,196
Mmm.

68
00:03:58,197 --> 00:03:59,741
Baby, let's eat.

69
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:04,996
Wow.

70
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:14,339
- How's the MAC coming?
- There's mac and cheese, too?

71
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:17,717
No, the Mental Augmentation Chamber.

72
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:20,303
Basically, it allows us to
tap into the Speed Force

73
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:21,930
to boost Barry's cognitive abilities.

74
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:23,013
It would allow him to see

75
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:25,558
every possible outcome to a scenario
at the same time.

76
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,143
So, speed-thinking?

77
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,871
Which means we'll be able
to catch all the bad guys faster.

78
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:30,581
With all the ones that
you brought in this summer, Barry,

79
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,249
the DA's office
can barely keep up with you.

80
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,901
Hey, since the MAC's done,
we should take it for a test run.

81
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:37,487
Absolutely not. You know
we're still working out diagnostics.

82
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:39,948
We could put in a few hours tonight,
get a head start.

83
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:42,784
Barry, if there's anything I've learned

84
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,285
since leaving Vibe behind,

85
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:47,163
it's that we all have
a work-life balance to protect.

86
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:51,042
And right now,
mine is tipping towards more beer.

87
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,589
Besides, I still gotta
tweak the mainframe,

88
00:04:56,673 --> 00:04:58,049
and I can't do that without...

89
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:02,469
Every time.

90
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:06,891
...my tablet. Thank you.

91
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:09,014
I'm gonna go get that beer.

92
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:16,985
Hey, so the last time I talked
to you guys, you seemed good.

93
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:20,947
You guys good?

94
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:27,286
We were devastated at first,
but Nora's only gone for right now.

95
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,957
We're gonna have kids someday,
and then we'll have another Nora.

96
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:32,834
Yeah. I think knowing that

97
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,003
we have a second chance
makes all the difference.

98
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:40,425
I gotta go.
A break-in at East Side Industrial.

99
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:44,637
Dad, um, I meant to ask you,

100
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:48,016
what did you do with those boxes
that were in the back of the garage?

101
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:52,478
Oh, he finally threw them away.
Thank you very much.

102
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:54,647
Okay. I gotta make a call.

103
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,110
Guys, I'm sorry,
I actually have to sneak out, too,

104
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,237
a friend of mine from med school
needs my support.

105
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,824
Thanks for having me. It was delicious.

106
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:06,117
Bye, Caitlin.

107
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:09,305
You notice ain't nobody help clean up?

108
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:12,981
<i>My name is Ramsey Rosso...</i>

109
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:20,381
and my mother, Dr. Rachel Rosso,
was everything to me.

110
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,802
When I was seven,
I skidded out pretty badly on a bike

111
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,679
she bought me for my birthday.

112
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:30,641
Imagine a scared kid with
two scraped knees and a bloody nose.

113
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:35,313
When Mum found me,
she picked me right up,

114
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,398
she brushed me off

115
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:40,985
and told me to get back on my bike
and ride.

116
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:45,031
I tried, but I couldn't.

117
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:49,952
It was almost like I was paralyzed.
It hurt so bad.

118
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:53,956
That's when she told me
that I would heal.

119
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,417
That I must never let a little pain

120
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:58,795
stop me from getting to
where I needed to go in life.

121
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,756
And she was right.

122
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:05,259
I did heal.

123
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:11,015
Enough to grow up
and follow in her footsteps.

124
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:17,647
And even though a beautiful life
was cut short

125
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:21,442
when she lost her battle
to heal herself...

126
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:26,948
she's still helping me
to get to where I need to go today.

127
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:37,083
And for that, I will always be grateful.

128
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,754
Thank you, Jonathan.

129
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:45,383
Ramsey, hi.

130
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:49,470
I'm so sorry for your loss.

131
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:51,806
Your mother was an incredible woman.
I'm gonna miss her.

132
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,767
It means so much that you came.

133
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:58,062
Mum actually saw
something of herself in you.

134
00:07:58,146 --> 00:07:59,939
Probably because
you're both overachievers.

135
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:03,693
Your hands are so cold.

136
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:07,113
Are you all right?

137
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,828
Yeah. Sorry, I'm fine. I'm probably
just coming down with something.

138
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,706
I hope not.
Doctors make rubbish patients.

139
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:20,543
- It was nice to see you.
- Caitlin...

140
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:26,257
Things have been a bit, uh, crazy.

141
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,470
Do you fancy coming around
for a cuppa sometime?

142
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,723
You know, for a proper catch up.

143
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,535
I could really use someone
to talk to right now.

144
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,187
Of course, any time.
Just give me a call.

145
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,326
Well, my log says
that your father's stuff

146
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:55,036
should've ended up
somewhere around here.

147
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:04,128
Here it is.

148
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,725
Must be pretty important.

149
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:22,480
Yeah, it is. Thanks.

150
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,448
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

151
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,037
Hey! Hang on, I got you!

152
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:50,674
Hang on!

153
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,180
Are you okay?

154
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,147
What the hell?

155
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:15,408
I missed you last night.
Are you sure you're okay?

156
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,700
Yeah.

157
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:19,370
What were you doing out here, anyway?

158
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,207
I was following up on a lead.

159
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:27,420
<i>The Citizen</i> got a tip that there were
a series of junkyard robberies.

160
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:30,631
People file police reports
for stolen trash?

161
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:36,429
Yeah, well, you know, not everything
that's here is garbage.

162
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:43,519
Everything here is garbage!

163
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:44,729
I hate garbage!

164
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,605
Okay, have fun with Ghostbusters.

165
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:48,009
- I'll see you at home.
- Mmm-hmm.

166
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:51,610
What do you got?

167
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,823
This site is littered, no pun intended,

168
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,908
with gamma rays and magnetar fields.

169
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:00,512
What are you saying?
Iris was attacked by a...

170
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:01,536
Yeah.

171
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,457
A frackin' black hole.

172
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:13,507
That is a whole lot of information
to disseminate.

173
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:16,260
No one's ever extrapolated this much
data from a black hole before.

174
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:18,095
We can be the first.

175
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:20,639
Come on, we're Team Flash.

176
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:22,975
What did you put in his coffee?

177
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:26,145
Okay, a black hole just showed up
and nearly swallowed Iris.

178
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,148
So, let's crunch the numbers,
find out where it went.

179
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:31,067
I'm sorry, are we looking
at the same screen?

180
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,861
Creating a search algorithm
for this is gonna be

181
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:36,822
like deciphering a mystery
wrapped up in an enigma.

182
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:40,993
Then it's a good thing that
mystery is my middle name.

183
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,455
The name is Dibny...

184
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,708
Ralph Dibny.

185
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:49,710
Welcome back, Ralph.

186
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:51,712
It's good to see you, man.

187
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,359
Nice threads, where did you get them?

188
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:54,882
Picked this up in the Opal.

189
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,635
A Missing Persons case send you
all the way to Opal City?

190
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,387
And beyond, my friend.

191
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,723
A summer spend undercover rubbing
Rolexes with the wealthy elite.

192
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,001
Did you guys know it's pronounced
"yacht" and not "ya-ch-t"?

193
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:08,062
- Yeah.
- God, I missed you.

194
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:10,290
Anyway, just following any leads
that might help explain

195
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,566
the disappearance of Sue Dearbon.

196
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,975
I don't think I've ever seen you
this devoted to a case.

197
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:18,614
Me neither,
but this one is a real tragedy.

198
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,075
Maybe it was the look of desperation
in her parents' eyes,

199
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,035
when they begged me
to find their daughter.

200
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:24,995
So, uh, what's new in Central City?

201
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:29,291
- We are trying to track a black hole.
- Of course you are.

202
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,378
We were just about
to start decoding this data stream.

203
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,881
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

204
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:38,300
I'm sorry. Sorry.

205
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,636
I've been having
these random frost-outs lately.

206
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,013
- For how long?
- All summer.

207
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:44,937
It's happened twice
in the last couple of days.

208
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:48,018
Cait, you're probably overworked.
Maybe take a time-out.

209
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:49,937
A friend of mine
did want to meet for coffee.

210
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:52,273
- Ramsey?
- Yeah.

211
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:55,985
It's never easy losing a parent.
Maybe you should take him up on it.

212
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,445
I'll give him a call.

213
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,533
Ah, found it.

214
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:06,745
Theft report for Leawood
and New Brighton junkyard.

215
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:09,224
- See? I have a system.
- You're a hoarder, but I love you.

216
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,248
Iris.

217
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:18,132
Huh. These don't seem to have
anything to do with the black hole.

218
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,342
They're just run of the mill
human thefts.

219
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:25,306
Well, you have a list of persons
of interest in any case.

220
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:28,267
Yeah, thank you.
Um, I'll get right on this.

221
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:29,893
Iris.

222
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,022
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

223
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:37,359
I don't know, maybe I'm still a
little shaken up from the black hole.

224
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,111
I'll be fine, thank you.

225
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:47,912
You remembered how I like my lattes.

226
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,206
With a bit of cinnamon, just like Mum.

227
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,374
You know,
of all her CC hospital residents,

228
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,293
she really took
a special liking to you.

229
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,671
She was the first person to realize
that I was into cutting-edge tech.

230
00:13:57,755 --> 00:14:00,132
It was her letter of recommendation

231
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:01,926
that started my career at S.T.A.R. Labs.

232
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:06,805
I couldn't save her, Cait.

233
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:11,060
I had to watch as her body betrayed her.

234
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,938
Do you know how HLH works?

235
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:18,484
Then you know the cancer literally
boils you from the inside out.

236
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:23,781
Can you imagine
what that must've felt like?

237
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,200
Watching her suffer...

238
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,871
That's my last memory of her.

239
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:32,831
Don't let it be.

240
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:36,126
What you said at the funeral,
about how brave she was,

241
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,211
remember that.

242
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,170
I lied.

243
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:41,799
Truth is, she was a coward.

244
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:44,760
What do you mean?

245
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:48,681
As a doctor, she knew
her chances of surviving were slim.

246
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,047
So, she just started
ticking things off her bucket list.

247
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:53,601
Isn't that a good thing?

248
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:57,189
She should've gone down fighting.
Instead, she ran away.

249
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,858
I didn't.

250
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:09,952
In HLH, white blood cells
attack the body's immune system.

251
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:14,582
The median survival rate after
diagnosis was two to six months.

252
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:16,541
Not anymore.

253
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:22,881
My God,
this is a potential cure.

254
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:26,302
But what's the bonding agent
strengthening the body's defenses?

255
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,344
Dark matter.

256
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:30,657
I know what you're thinking, Cait.

257
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,725
I thought the same thing, too, at first.

258
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,568
But I've been running
simulations for months,

259
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:37,396
and they all show the same results.
My cure will work.

260
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:40,774
Or turn them into meta-humans
against their will.

261
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:41,858
But I can save lives.

262
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,986
I just need the dark matter
to start human trials.

263
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:47,948
And that's why you wanted
to get coffee with me.

264
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:51,243
S.T.A.R. Labs has the dark matter
I need to take the next step.

265
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:52,328
You have access to it.

266
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:54,663
Ramsey, your research,
it's groundbreaking.

267
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:58,626
But using dark matter,
that's a deal breaker.

268
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,753
It wasn't when you made
the meta-human cure.

269
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:03,464
That was different,
we were trying to protect them.

270
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:05,347
But what about the rest of us?

271
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,431
I'm sorry. I really am.

272
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,184
But my answer is still no.

273
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:28,864
She didn't have to die, Cait.
No one with HLH does.

274
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,368
Because you could help me stop it.

275
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:30,968
Frost, where are you?

276
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,459
- How are you feeling?
- Like I should be dead.

277
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,793
That's not gonna happen.

278
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:07,296
We're Team Flash,
we always watch each other's backs.

279
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:08,565
And we always keep each other safe.

280
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:11,175
Meanwhile, over here in the real world,

281
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,051
our black hole keeps growing up.

282
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,175
Only next time it pops up,
it won't just be Jitters,

283
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,991
the whole city could be in danger.

284
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,017
Why did this thing show up
outside Jitters, anyway?

285
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,344
What does a coffee shop
have in common with a junkyard?

286
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:24,730
I think I know who can tell us.

287
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:30,486
Okay, so I followed up with CCPD's
list of junkyard robberies.

288
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:33,197
Ten of them were persons of interest.
Nine were career criminals.

289
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,908
But this one guy, a scientist,

290
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:39,286
was let go with a warning after being
caught stealing old lab equipment.

291
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:43,123
Team Flash, meet Chester P. Runk.

292
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,834
<i>Hey, what up, party people?</i>

293
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,128
<i>Welcome to a world where all are welcome</i>

294
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:52,174
<i>and anything, including
the scientifically impossible,</i>

295
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:55,260
<i>can and probably will happen.</i>

296
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:57,554
<i>I'm your boy</i>...

297
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:59,556
<i>- ... Chester!</i>
- I really like him.

298
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,157
<i>I'm gonna rock your world
with knowledge</i>

299
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,228
<i>from the bleeding edge of physics</i>

300
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,730
<i>and beyond. Beyond... Beyond...</i>

301
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:08,440
<i>I've been working on that echo.</i>

302
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:12,194
<i>And, yes, as usual,
I'm fueled by some...</i>

303
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:16,657
<i>Mmm! Damn fine coffee
from everyone's favorite beanerie.</i>

304
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:21,912
<i>Poured, of course, to perfection
by a certain special someone.</i>

305
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,330
Hmm? Huh? Huh?

306
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,544
<i>No, WookieLover77, I...</i>

307
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:33,715
<i>I have not asked her out yet.
But I've got my punch card. Okay?</i>

308
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:37,302
<i>Three more Vibe-accinos
and I'm making my move, baby.</i>

309
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:40,430
<i>I'm making my move, baby.
I'm making my move, baby</i>.

310
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:43,934
Okay, he talks about Natalie
for a while, so...

311
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:45,227
Here we go.

312
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,816
Is he building
what I think he's building?

313
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,652
<i>Behold, believers.</i>

314
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,738
<i>A gravitational wave-emitter powered
by a modulating neutrino charger.</i>

315
00:19:56,822 --> 00:20:00,993
<i>In other words,
"time to call some aliens."</i>

316
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,911
He built this in his garage?

317
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:05,831
Using nothing but trash, what a legend.

318
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:06,956
Oh, he's turning it on.

319
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,920
<i>Oh, no. No, no, no,
that's not supposed to do that.</i>

320
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:14,256
<i>Oh, crap.</i>

321
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,008
<i>Uh, hold on.</i>

322
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:24,391
Okay, not exactly getting
the supervillain vibe

323
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,642
from our boy Chester here.

324
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,603
He opened a black hole by accident.

325
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,354
And what about Chester? Is he okay?

326
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:31,541
Well, police reports show
that EMTs took him to the ER.

327
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,165
But then after that,
the trail goes cold.

328
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,068
Just a tiny question here.

329
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:37,487
How do we destroy a black hole?

330
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,124
Well, I am not a doctor...

331
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:53,712
but I'm gonna assume, in this case,
that negative means a positive?

332
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:56,715
Not if it means being clueless
about why my powers won't work.

333
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:59,009
Did anything out of the ordinary
happen recently?

334
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:02,304
I went to my friend
Ramsey's mom's funeral yesterday.

335
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:03,787
Anything unusual about the service?

336
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:07,935
No, it was a lovely service
for an inspiring woman.

337
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:11,313
And today, I nearly got sucked
into oblivion.

338
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:16,568
Has our frosty femme fatale ever
refused to come out like this before?

339
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:19,780
The last time I can think of
is right after my dad died.

340
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:21,739
Right.

341
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:25,327
So, you think funeral plus nearly
getting sucked into a black hole

342
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,955
equals Killer Frost is afraid of dying?

343
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:31,500
Maybe. But I know
we're gonna figure this out.

344
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,137
This place creeps me out.

345
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,558
Will this sort you out?

346
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:52,020
Nice doing business with you.

347
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,280
Whoever pissed you off
won't be a problem anymore.

348
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,603
Chester P. Runk is here?

349
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:16,586
Ward nurses say he's been catatonic
since he arrived.

350
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,423
Just involuntary muscle spasms.

351
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:26,595
Chester?

352
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,356
My name is Iris West-Allen,
I'm a reporter.

353
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,486
Chester, can you hear me?

354
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:50,328
He was our only lead.

355
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:53,831
Iris.

356
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:59,129
You lost something of Nora's
last night, didn't you?

357
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,799
Something that Joe
accidentally threw away,

358
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,718
it ended up at that junkyard.

359
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,937
I just miss her so much.

360
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,441
Every day, every minute.

361
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,153
And I know that is selfish because...

362
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:27,407
one day, I'm gonna
get to see Nora again.

363
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:32,329
But it won't be our Nora, you know.
The one that we knew, the one that...

364
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:37,167
we have pictures of, the one
that we grew to love. You know...

365
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,338
That Nora is gone forever.

366
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,968
And I guess, because of that,
you know, I just...

367
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:50,514
I don't know how I'm supposed to feel.

368
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:53,850
Iris, you do not get to cheat
the grieving process

369
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:56,478
just because you know
you're gonna see Nora again someday.

370
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:00,440
Yeah, you're right.

371
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:06,279
I guess I just haven't been able to
put into words how I've been feeling.

372
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:14,912
Iris.

373
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,501
What is it?

374
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,679
It's Chester.

375
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:41,356
Oh, my God.

376
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:46,278
You're looking at
the world's first inverse mass

377
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,655
angular momentum disruptor.

378
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:53,785
But we can just call it
the stellar grenade.

379
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:57,622
Cool. So, this will destroy
the black hole?

380
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:00,208
As long as it doesn't get much bigger,

381
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:03,378
this will reverse the hole's
mass collecting properties,

382
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,422
causing it to implode.

383
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,133
Just toss it in the event horizon,

384
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:10,051
hasta lasagna, don't get any on ya.

385
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:12,553
We can't.

386
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:16,474
If we destroy it,
we're gonna kill Chester, too.

387
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:27,795
You sure about this?

388
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:29,196
Yeah, the corona's flare matched

389
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,156
the exact cadence of Chester's fingers.

390
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:34,743
So, the black hole
and Chester are connected?

391
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,370
Actually, I think Chester
is the black hole.

392
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,248
Watch this. So, normally,

393
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,334
stimuli enters the brain
through the sensory area,

394
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,544
goes up to the temporal lobe,
and then back around.

395
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:47,047
But watch what happens
in Chester's brain.

396
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:50,717
It starts in the right area,
but halfway through its rotation,

397
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,801
it disappears.

398
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:54,930
I think I know where it's going.

399
00:25:57,432 --> 00:26:00,018
You're looking at a map of
the negative ionic energy

400
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,101
inside the black hole.

401
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:04,231
Watch what happens when an energy
pulse travels along its tendrils.

402
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:05,899
See how it stops halfway?

403
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:12,656
The black hole is the other half
of Chester's mind.

404
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:14,199
It's his consciousness.

405
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:16,368
Maybe it's been showing up in places

406
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:19,120
that hold
an emotional attachment for him.

407
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:22,082
Like the junkyard,
where he stole stuff for his projects.

408
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:23,601
He had a crush on a girl at Jitters.

409
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,294
Okay, so all we have to do
is get Chester's mind

410
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:29,172
out of the black hole,
reunite it with his body,

411
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:32,717
and once his condition stabilizes,
the black hole should just collapse.

412
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:36,096
Right. But they don't exactly
teach that in med school.

413
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,698
Okay, but we can't just let Chester die.

414
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:38,848
We have to do something.

415
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:45,563
Look, I don't like saying it,

416
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:49,025
but I think we need to consider it.

417
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,361
Cisco, I know where you're going.

418
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,571
You know we already
have a way of beating this

419
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,716
- before it gets any bigger.
- We're not discussing this.

420
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,826
You think I like saying this? I don't.

421
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:00,620
But if we don't find a solution
for this and find one now,

422
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:01,973
we're gonna have to make
a choice down the line.

423
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:03,182
And it's either gonna be Chester,

424
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:04,517
or it's gonna be
everyone in Central City.

425
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,001
I'm not losing anyone else!

426
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,338
Let's find another way.

427
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,604
Where's the meltdown?

428
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:29,273
We gotta talk.

429
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:33,611
What is your problem?

430
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:37,324
My problem is, we needed you,

431
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,035
and you were holed up
in your snow-tress of solitude.

432
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:42,037
You even refused to come out at Jitters.

433
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,998
Flash was there,
so spare me the little hallway chat.

434
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:47,042
And I am not afraid of dying.

435
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:51,171
I know that,
but you are afraid of living.

436
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,174
Thomas' death, the funeral,

437
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:56,737
what happened at Jitters,
all those things happened to Caitlin.

438
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,777
She also led her high school debate team

439
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,138
to back-to-back championships,

440
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:03,350
she went to med school,
she married Ronnie.

441
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,686
- Those are her memories.
- Yes, I know. I was there.

442
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:08,813
What's your point?

443
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:12,400
Having Caitlin's memories
isn't the same as having your own.

444
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:14,986
Like you'd know anything about that.

445
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:17,572
I know it sucked sitting courtside
for The Thinker show

446
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:18,948
when he hijacked my body.

447
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:21,344
And I think that you've been
going through something similar

448
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:22,786
since Thomas died.

449
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,525
And after being at that funeral,

450
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:28,917
seeing that woman live the last days
of her life to the fullest,

451
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:32,598
I think that made you want to start
living your best life right now.

452
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,715
That's not my gig. Okay?

453
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:39,010
I fight the bad guys, keep Caity safe...

454
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:42,263
and then go back in my cage.

455
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:45,183
I just have to deal with it.

456
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:48,151
Have you thought to ask Caitlin
how she feels?

457
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:53,525
What's she gonna say?
"Go ahead, Frost, take the wheel."

458
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:56,096
There's only one way to find out.

459
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,352
You know, Barry, I think
it's time we face the truth.

460
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:12,919
I can't give up on Chester.

461
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:16,673
No, I meant about Nora.

462
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:21,010
Look, I know we keep saying
that we're fine.

463
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:22,887
But I still miss the Nora...

464
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:26,349
that was, Barry,
not the Nora that will be,

465
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,101
and I think that you do, too.

466
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:34,107
I think that's why you've been
working so hard all summer.

467
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:39,487
I thought if I could keep people safe,

468
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,451
that it would make up
for how much I missed her.

469
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,953
Like, all the work this summer,
and the long hours,

470
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:49,873
pushing myself, pushing the team...

471
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,836
it was so I could avoid
what scares me the most.

472
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:58,840
I'll never get over this.

473
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:03,011
There is no support group
for what we're experiencing.

474
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:11,019
You know why I was at that junkyard?

475
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:16,608
I lost my purple jacket.

476
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:21,571
And I was obsessed with

477
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,158
getting it back because...

478
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:29,329
you know, in my mind...

479
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,334
Nora needs it.

480
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:36,836
You know, she needs it to become XS.

481
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:43,468
And when that thing
swallowed it, just...

482
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:48,515
Just for, like, a tiny second,
I wanted it to swallow me, too.

483
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:01,170
You know, the only way
we're gonna get through this

484
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:03,154
is if we carry this burden together.

485
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:06,741
That's the only way, Barry.

486
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:18,878
We just ran out of time.

487
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,852
Okay, so how do we get Chester's
consciousness out of the black hole?

488
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:38,356
Well, the electrical impulses
that make up Chester's mind

489
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,608
are just past
the black hole's threshold,

490
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:43,444
but since his synaptic energy
has a negative charge...

491
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:45,714
I could use my lightning's positive
charge to attract his energy.

492
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:46,906
- Like a magnet.
- Exactly.

493
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,343
Then what? I mean, how are you gonna
survive inside of there?

494
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:51,744
Your... your Speed Force aura
should protect you, right?

495
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,163
What if it doesn't?

496
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:57,417
The gravimetric forces will crush you
to a subatomic size within seconds.

497
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,500
That's not gonna happen.

498
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:01,301
The Speed Force is a billion times
stronger than any gravimetric force.

499
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:03,047
Even if you do survive the entry,

500
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:06,968
we don't have a way of keeping
Chester's mind intact on the way out.

501
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:10,638
We need superconductive wiring
from a quantum computer to do that,

502
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:13,474
and last time I checked,
those only exist in the future.

503
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:18,146
Nora. Our Nora.

504
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:19,939
She can still help us.

505
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:22,817
Oh, my God, her backup gauntlet.
Cisco, it's still here.

506
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:24,944
That gauntlet's gonna have
the filament we need.

507
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:26,714
I'll strip it out and thread it
into your suit.

508
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:28,781
Okay, in the meantime,
Ralph, can you and Frost

509
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:30,074
help CCPD evacuate downtown?

510
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:33,953
Frost is ready to come out
and to use Cisco's present.

511
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:45,214
Captain, you shouldn't be out here.

512
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:47,109
It's my city, too.
Help these people get out of here.

513
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,384
Yes, sir!

514
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:12,700
Run, dude.

515
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:22,794
You're welcome.

516
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,170
Suit's finished.

517
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:27,965
Okay, great, so, when Barry gets
Chester's consciousness out of there,

518
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:30,176
what is he supposed to do
with that energy?

519
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:31,511
You remember the MAC?

520
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:32,887
Yeah, but it's not working.

521
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,348
No, but the structural integrity
is strong enough

522
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:37,183
to contain synaptic energy.

523
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:40,228
Besides, we already
moved Chester into it, so...

524
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,772
I'm sorry, what? We moved Chester?

525
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:45,817
That's right. I may be small,
but I can bench my body weight.

526
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:54,741
That's it.

527
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:01,392
I've been saving this

528
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,543
for the right moment, since day one.

529
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:04,627
Really, Cisco?

530
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,796
The guy is running in
and out of a black hole.

531
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:10,091
- Good point.
- Yeah.

532
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:17,390
<i>Flash! A-ah!</i>

533
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,726
<i>He's a miracle</i>

534
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,229
That's your window! Go!

535
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,986
<i>Flash! A-ah!</i>

536
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:33,114
<i>King of the impossible</i>

537
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:38,745
<i>He's for every one of us
Stand for every one of us</i>

538
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:41,956
<i>He saves with a mighty hand
Every man, every woman</i>

539
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,750
<i>Every child, it's the mighty flash</i>

540
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:46,878
- How long before he comes out?
- Seconds.

541
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:49,422
I think.

542
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:50,965
- You think?
- I think...

543
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:52,049
Barry?

544
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:53,801
<i>Barry, can you hear me?</i>

545
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:56,595
Barry.

546
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,183
<i>Barry, Barry, please, say something.</i>

547
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:02,935
<i>Babe, please.</i>

548
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:08,107
Please, Barry, I can't lose you, too.

549
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:10,734
<i>Flash!</i>

550
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:14,655
<i>King of the impossible</i>

551
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:19,994
<i>He's for every one of us
Stand for every one of us</i>

552
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:23,539
<i>He saves with a mighty hand
Every man, every woman</i>

553
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,500
<i>Every child, it's the mighty flash</i>

554
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,642
The black hole imploded.

555
00:35:45,019 --> 00:35:46,019
Chester.

556
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:48,898
Can you hear me?

557
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,778
Come back here. To us.

558
00:35:54,237 --> 00:35:55,446
To this body.

559
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:57,240
To yourself.

560
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:02,411
What up, party people!

561
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:05,122
Hey, hey, you're the Flash.

562
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:08,543
With the speeding around
and the lightning, and all that.

563
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:10,962
Big fan, man, big fan.

564
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:12,338
Also, where am I?

565
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:25,852
Chester is doing so much better.

566
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:27,103
I mean, don't get me wrong,

567
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:29,188
he's still, you know,
glowing in the eyes

568
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:31,899
with orange dark energy,
but he's in really good spirits.

569
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:33,442
How long until he gets out?

570
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:36,946
Caitlin said his molecules need to
re-stabilize at the sub-atomic level.

571
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:38,948
My guess is,
he'll need to cook in the MAC

572
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,616
for another four to six weeks,

573
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,618
maybe more, until he's back to normal.

574
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:44,495
Oh, believe me, he's more than happy

575
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,914
to chill here at S.T.A.R. Labs
in the meantime.

576
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,082
And when he does get out,

577
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:50,167
that boy knows exactly
what he wants to do.

578
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:52,503
Mmm, definitely gonna ask Natalie out.

579
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,130
Speaking of going out,

580
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:56,132
Kamilla and I are doing
shawarma-Tuesday,

581
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:57,967
so I'm gonna mosey.

582
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,679
Of course, moseying
is a lot harder these days post-Vibe.

583
00:37:01,846 --> 00:37:05,057
Showing up to a date in the
S.T.A.R. Labs van, not a good look.

584
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,435
Mmm, no. I'll give you a ride.

585
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:09,770
And risk looking like
my mom just dropped me off?

586
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:11,939
Or even better, you can walk.

587
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:14,901
Okay, I'm coming.

588
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,991
It never occurred to me
that you might wanna live a life.

589
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:24,337
That's why I never offered
to let you drive.

590
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,579
Not because I think
you're only good in a fight.

591
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:28,998
<i>You sure?
I know it's a really big ask</i>

592
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,834
<i>I don't want you
feeling obligated or whatever.</i>

593
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:36,047
Frost, you have always been there
for me, protecting me...

594
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:38,966
Now, I get to do something for you.

595
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:44,472
Besides, even though it's always felt
like you were a part of me,

596
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:47,767
for the first time,
it feels like I'm a part of you.

597
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:48,935
<i>Thank you.</i>

598
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:51,270
Any time.

599
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:02,615
Guess everything's
coming up Frosty, huh?

600
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:04,282
Yeah, I guess.

601
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:07,161
Where do I start?

602
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:10,665
How do you, you know, live a life?

603
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:13,000
With a life coach, of course.

604
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:19,173
So, first things first,
the name "Killer,"

605
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:20,901
it's a little bit too much
for some folks.

606
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:24,261
Have you thought about changing it?
My mom's middle name is Anne.

607
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:02,675
I'll never accept death.
Not like you did.

608
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:35,499
So, what made you believe that

609
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:38,252
you could carry Chester
out of that place?

610
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:40,504
You made me believe I could do it.

611
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:45,217
I realized we could be
each other's support group.

612
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:48,387
Even though it's gonna take some time.

613
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:51,223
If we can carry a memory
like this together in our hearts,

614
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,102
carrying somebody's consciousness
out of a black hole,

615
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:56,312
it's a piece of cake.

616
00:39:58,314 --> 00:40:01,108
Besides, how else
could I get this back for you?

617
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:14,663
I know it's not as good as Nora's video.

618
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,505
It's better.

619
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,341
Now we have something
that we can honor Nora with.

620
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:28,219
She was pretty schway.

621
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:42,899
What do you want?

622
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:45,486
For your universe to survive.

623
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:46,778
The plinth.

624
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,366
You destroyed it.
You destroyed Nora's message.

625
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,034
Unfortunate side-effect.

626
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:55,663
But I needed to discourage you.

627
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:57,748
From doing what?

628
00:40:58,457 --> 00:40:59,457
Hoping.

629
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,670
Your determination is boundless, Flash.

630
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:04,421
It is one of your greatest qualities.

631
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:06,590
But you cannot avoid the coming crisis.

632
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:08,968
Barry has five years before he vanishes.

633
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:10,136
No longer.

634
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:13,180
December 10th, 2019.

635
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:17,268
On that day, he will answer the call.

636
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:20,604
And make the ultimate sacrifice.

637
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:26,402
Soon, this world will fight for
the fate of all the known universes.

638
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:28,028
I'm not gonna leave my family.

639
00:41:29,113 --> 00:41:30,865
There has to be a way
to stop what's coming.

640
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:32,408
I am sorry.

641
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:36,912
But events have been set into motion
that you cannot possibly comprehend.

642
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:38,664
I don't need to understand them!

643
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:41,750
- Just tell me what I can do.
- To survive?

644
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:44,919
You can't.

645
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:49,341
In order for billions to survive
this coming crisis...

646
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:53,429
the Flash must die.
