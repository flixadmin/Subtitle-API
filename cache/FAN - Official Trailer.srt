1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,060
This connection of mine
is an amazing thing.

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,060
If it happens
then it happens...

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,500
My connection is stronger
than WiFi or Bluetooth

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,280
He is not just a star...
He is my world

5
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,940
Only fake fans
cheer from distance.

6
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,080
I will hug him and
give my trophy to him

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,960
Everytime it's Aryan...
- What are you to Aryan Khanna?

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,020
Fan...

9
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,300
Aryan Khanna...

10
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,940
A small birthday gift
To the love of my life

11
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,140
Aryan Khanna
- Happy Birthday, Sir

12
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,820
He's a fan...
Calls himself "Junior Aryan Khanna"

13
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,000
Listen to me carefully
What you did...

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,540
...is wrong
- No, I did so much for you...

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,840
Who are you to do
anything for me?

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,180
Your fan
- You are not my fan

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,640
Don't say that. Can't I have
5 minutes of your time?

18
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,700
My life...

19
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,700
My time...

20
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,020
Why should I give
even 5 seconds?

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,820
Before, the fan used
to chase the star.

22
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,420
Now, the star will
chase the fan.

23
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,560
I would like to warn you

24
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,940
He can hurt anyone at anytime.

25
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,060
If Gaurav is there
then Aryan is there

26
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,060
If Gaurav is not there...

27
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,380
...then Aryan is nothing.
