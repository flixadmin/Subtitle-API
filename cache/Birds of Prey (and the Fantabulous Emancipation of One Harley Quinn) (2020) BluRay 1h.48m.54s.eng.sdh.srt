That wasn't me.

348
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,942
But you dared him to do it.

349
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,444
Yeah, but I dare a lot of people
to do a lot of things, okay?

350
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,655
- Come on. I'm not even with him anymore.
- I know.

351
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,698
That means

352
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,535
there's no one here to stop me.

00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,579

Fuck, Montoya,

366
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,288
Not today, Simpson.

367
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,832
Hey, it's Detective Montoya.
Respect your elders.

368
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,917
I mean, your elderly.
[laughing]

369
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,545
You're only a few years younger than me,
and you're still behind that desk.

370
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:08,963
You wanna go there?

371
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,090
Come on. Empty your pockets.
All of it.

372
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,509
[Montoya] Cassandra Cain,
back already?

373
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,679
Thought by now you'd figure out
how not to get caught.

374
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,348
What? No comeback?

375
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,143
[coughs]

00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,270
You all right?

377
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,189
You smell like shit.

378
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,442
[Montoya scoffs]

379
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,444
Yo, Simpson.

380
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,405
Any clean clothes in lost and found?

381
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:40,328
These are serious accusations,
Miss Montoya.

382
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,165
The Sionis family name is on
half the museums and schools in Gotham.

383
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,709
And that makes him
immune to the law, Captain?

384
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:50,379
[Harley] <i>Montoya's day is going
almost as badly as mine.</i>

385
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,715
<i>Remember the guy
who stole her promotion?</i>

386
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,799
<i>That's him.</i>

387
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,052
He had four people killed
alone last night.

388
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,054
If Roman Sionis is such a mastermind,

389
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,139
how'd he get fired
from his own fucking company?

390
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,184
The Janus Corporation is
his father's company, thank you.

391
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,144
And by the way, they cut him off.

392
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,147
Where does the DA's office stand
on all this?

393
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,523
[Harley] <i>To make matters worse,</i>

394
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,359
<i>the assistant DA?
That's her ex.</i>

395
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,778
The evidence that Sionis is
linked to these murders--

396
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,446
There's a shipment coming in.

397
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:16,989
[Erickson] Drugs?

398
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,449
- A diamond.
- [Munroe] A diamond.

399
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,493
Wow, Montoya. Should we call
the Feds for backup?

400
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,745
[Montoya] Listen,
I had a source at the club.

401
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,829
His driver.

402
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,956
He said that Roman
couldn't stop talking about this thing.

403
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,376
And he said that he overheard something
about laser-encoding.

404
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,919
Now, I did some research.

405
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,588
I think it's the Bertinelli diamond.

406
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,341
You remember
the Bertinelli massacre, right?

407
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,926
[Harley]
<i>Quick history lesson.</i>

408
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,844
<i>Fifteen years ago, one of the wealthiest</i>

409
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,514
<i>Mafia families in Gotham
was gunned down.</i>

410
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,141
<i>It was a power grab,
but the real target</i>

411
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:48,729
<i>was the Bertinellis'
super-secret offshore bank accounts,</i>

412
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,398
<i>the details of which
were said to be encoded</i>

413
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:54,026
<i>in the atomic structure
of a 30-carat diamond.</i>

414
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,861
<i>The rock was lost.</i>

415
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,156
<i>And with it,
the only key to the Bertinelli fortune.</i>

416
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:03,786
Which is exactly why Roman Sionis
is trying to get his hands on it.

417
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,830
That's what makes him so dangerous.

418
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,540
He's already building an army.

419
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:08,916
If he gets the diamond,

420
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,501
he'll have all the money
and connections

421
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:14,922
to bribe every single judge and cop
he needs to get a monopoly on the city.

422
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,966
You said you had someone on the inside?

423
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,719
- [cell phone vibrating]
- Yes. He's... [stammering]

424
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,762
He's no longer there, but...

425
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,556
So basically, you have nothing.

426
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,142
You are trying to go after

427
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,978
one of the most litigious and
wealthiest families in Gotham,

428
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,147
and all you've got
is rumors and a hunch?

429
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,982
- [vibrating continues]
- Well, you know,

430
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,942
the DA's office is building
a case against him, too.

431
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,485
Isn't that right, Miss Yee?

432
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,654
Listen, if the DA is
willing to throw himself

433
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,282
out in front of this, it's fine with me.

434
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:42,491
Captain, no.

435
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:46,871
Listen, Munroe, find me some tangible
connection to Sionis, all right?

436
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,998
- Yes, sir.
- Wait, wait, wait. Captain.

437
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,416
This is my case, okay?

438
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,168
I've been working on this
for six months.

439
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:56,213
We need something that
we can actually use, Detective.

440
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,883
And, Miss Montoya,
we do have a dress code.

441
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,972
- Look, I'm sorry about that, but I--
- No.

442
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,225
That is my job you are fucking with.
What is wrong with you, Renee?

443
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,935
Me? He gave my case away.

444
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,103
Oh, poor Renee.

01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:36,970
You're suspended.

1277
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:40,223
Your badge and your gun, now.

1278
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:47,522
[Harley] <i>If you've ever watched
any cop movie ever,</i>

<i>you know that
this is when shit gets real.</i>

1280
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:52,193
What's the point of the badge,

1281
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,072
when it means fuck all anyway?

1282
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,325
Right, Captain?

1283
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:04,163
<i>No cop ever gets anything done
until after they've been suspended.</i>

only I had more pressing concerns.</i>

1285
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:14,674
And that is why you should never partake
in paying federal income taxes.

1286
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,176
Hey, you'll ruin your nails.

1287
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:21,889
Thank you.

1288
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:24,017
Anyway, lesson 37.

[Bruce growling]

1291
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,271
You said they wouldn't find us.

1292
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:31,316
Chillax. No one knows we're here.

1293
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:34,193
[officer] Harleen Quinzel,
this is Gotham Police.

1294
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,862
Okay. So they know.

1295
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:37,488
Let's scram.

1296
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,034
[officer] Open the door.

1297
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,411
Holy back door, Beavy.
This is getting outta hand.

1298
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:44,746
Bruce, come here.
[whistles]

1299
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:46,289
[officer] I can hear you!
Open the door.

1300
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:48,583
What is that?

1301
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:52,045
See you in hell, Harley!

1302
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,341
- [man yelling]
- Get under the table!

1303

1304
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,763
Come here! No!

[both panting]

1306
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,441
Bruce?

1307
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,779
Come here, boy. Bruce?

1308
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:21,783
Bruce?

1309
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:24,452
Bruce?

1310
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,039
This doesn't make sense.

1311
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:30,625
It doesn't make sense.
I don't understand.

1312
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:34,629
No one knew we were here.
No one knew we were here, except...

1313
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:36,631
Doc.

1314
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:37,799
Oh, my God. Doc?

1315
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:41,928
Doc? Where is he?

1316
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:44,555
Doc?

1317
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:48,559
I can't find Bruce.
I can't find him. I...

1318
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:56,275
No.

1319
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:58,695
I'm sorry, lotus flower.

1320
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:00,863
You sold me out?

1321
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,991
Too many people offering me
too much money.

1322
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:08,204
I have enough now
to open up a new restaurant.

1323
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,289
A really nice one.

1324
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:11,749
But, Doc,

1325
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,960
it's me.

1326
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,295
It's just business.

- You're right.
- [Cassandra] Harley?

1331
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:51,497
He's right.

1332
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,334
Business is business.

1333
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:58,254
I've got the kid.

1334
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,716
But I'm gonna need to renegotiate
the terms of our deal.

1335
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,593
If I hand her over,

1336
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:06,137
I want everyone who's after me
to back off.

Fine.

Meet me at Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap. In one hour.

You're gonna be
driving Mr. Zsasz tonight.

Go. Fetch. Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap.

1353
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:03,361
Do we have to bring them back?

1354
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:07,448
I think you can manage
a couple of little girls.

01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:06,515
You little fucking bird.

1440
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:09,768
That's why he needs me
to look out for him.

1441
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:14,732
That's why he needs me
to take care of him.

1442
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,986
You know you're just
being paranoid, Zsasz.

1443
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:20,905
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1444
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:22,114
Prove it to me.

1445
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:25,743
Rip open her little tummy.

1446
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:27,203
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

1447
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,538
Now! Rip it open!

1448
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:32,833
[Zsasz groaning]

[Zsasz screaming]

1452

[Harley grunting]

1453
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:54,688
Freeze!

1454
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:00,069
Don't fucking move.

1455
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,114
Who the fuck are you?

1456
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:12,331
Go get the kid.

1457
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:13,916
- All right.
- [gun cocks]

1458
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:16,085
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- [Cassandra] Back the fuck up!

1459
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:18,420
- Get away from me. All of you.
- [Lance] Put that shit down.

1460
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,798
Shoot them, kid.

1461
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:24,718
You, put that stupid-ass
Robin Hood piece of shit down!

1462
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:27,638
- Cass, it's okay. Just calm--
- Don't move!

1463
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:28,806
Okay.

1464
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:31,725
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

1465
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:33,352
But I know that this shit stick...

1466
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:34,436
[Cassandra grunts]

1467
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:36,897
...just tried to gut me.

1468
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:38,899
And you.

1469
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:42,778
Thought you were different.

1470
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:46,991
I'm sorry, kid.

1471
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:52,121
I'm just a terrible person, I guess.

1472
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:00,087
Ooh!

1473
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:02,006
Ooh, I'm back.

1474
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:05,759
Okay, I feel like I've just walked in on
something I don't give two shits about.

1475
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:08,095
This guy's dead, so I'm just
gonna get outta your hair. Cool?

1476
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:11,265
No. Wait. She's lying.
She works for Sionis.

1477
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:12,850
Excuse me? I work for Sionis?

1478
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,646
I'm not letting you sell the kid to him.

1479
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:20,816
I wasn't going to sell the kid.
I was going to trade the kid.

1480
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:22,651
Yeah. To save your own stupid skin. Huh?

1481
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,738
I'm not proud of what I did,
but I had half the city after me.

1482
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:27,698
Even the fucking Crossbow Killer.

1483
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,491
I'm not the Crossbow Killer!

1484
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:30,617
Whoa.

1485
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:33,579
They call me...

1486
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:34,747
Helena Bertinelli.

1487
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:36,290
For fuck's sake.

1488
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:38,459
As in the Bertinelli massacre?

1489
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:42,379
Sheesh kebab.
That is childhood trauma, right there.

1490
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:49,845
[Huntress] <i>I killed Galante.</i>

[groans]

1492
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:55,642
I killed his firing squad.

1493
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:57,227
[both groan]

1494
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:02,858
<i>I killed Victor Zsasz.</i>

[groans]

1496
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,366
And now I'm done.

1497
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:13,285
Bravo.

1498
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:20,292
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna leave now.

1499
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:21,543
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1500
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,631
I hate to be the one to break it to you,
sweetheart, but you are not done.

1501
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:29,009
Who do you think funded
Galante's little power grab, huh?

1502
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:31,053
Galante was
working with Sionis.

1503
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,555
Roman killed your whole family
looking for that rock.

1504
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,849
You don't think
he's gonna kill this kid?

1505
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,103
That diamond is our only chance
of stopping him.

1506
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:40,270
[Cassandra] You guys.

1507
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:42,773
Hey, I think you should see this.

1508
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:46,443
Oh.

1509
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:48,112
It's Sionis.

1510
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:02,167
We're fucked.

1511
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:04,711
He bought himself an army.

1512
01:22:13,554 --> 01:22:14,555
They're all here for me.

1513
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:18,183
Aren't they?

1514
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:26,608
- No.
- They're not?

1515
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,026
No, they're not.

1516
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:30,362
Do you know what that means?

1517
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:32,197
That means he's not just
after the kid anymore.

1518
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:33,574
He's after all of us.

1519
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:36,243
He's sure as hell after me.
I just robbed him.

1520
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:39,830
You just betrayed him.
You just killed his BFF.

1521
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:42,833
And you're dumb enough
to be building a case against him.

1522
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:46,253
So, unless we all wanna die
very unpleasant deaths

1523
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:49,631
and let Roman go finger-fishing
in the kid's intestinal tract,

1524
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:52,551
we're gonna have to work together.

1525
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:55,012
With you?

1526
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:56,221
Yeah.

1527
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:57,848
- [crying quietly]
- We're gonna work together,

1528
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:59,600
and we'll get outta here
in one piece, okay?

1529

[Montoya scoffs]

1530
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:04,980
Okay.

01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:08,442
Yeah. Okay.

1532
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,404
Sure.

1533
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:13,947
Yes!

1534
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:16,241
But we are gonna need
some serious hardware.

1535
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:17,326
Mmm-hmm.

1536
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:23,749
Will this do?

1537
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:26,335
No.

1538
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:28,128
- Not at all.

[Montoya] We're dead.
We're fucking dead.

That slimy jizznozzle!

1542
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:36,011
- I can't believe he took it all!
- [Huntress] We're fucked.

1543
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,847
- Fuck!
- Uh, there's this.

Okay.

I have funded you. I've protected you.

1547
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:11,880
I've scratched your backs
and kept you outta jail.

1548
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:15,008
Well, now it's time to say thank you.

1549
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:21,974
Go show those little bitches
you don't mess with Roman Sionis.

1550
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:25,894
Half a mil to whoever
brings me the girl alive.

1551
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,896
The rest you can kill.

1552
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:35,237
Dope.

1553
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:38,699
Oh, no, no, no. Not that one.

Sentimental value. Try this.

1555

- You're kidding.
- What? Gotta take care of the girls.

1556
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:48,083
Isn't this fun? It's just
like a sleepover. [gasps]

1557
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,502
We should order pizza. Make cosmos.

1558

- Harley, focus. Yeah.
- Okay.

1559
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:56,466
Hey, nice. What the hell is up
with this bow and arrow shtick?

1560
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:59,636
It's not a fucking bow and arrow.
It's a crossbow. I'm not 12.

1561
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:01,471
[laughs] I love this chick.
She's got rage issues.

[shouting]
I don't have rage issues.

1563
01:25:03,307 --> 01:25:05,976
You know, psychologically speaking,

1564
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:08,604
vengeance rarely brings
the catharsis we hope for.

1565

Yeah.
