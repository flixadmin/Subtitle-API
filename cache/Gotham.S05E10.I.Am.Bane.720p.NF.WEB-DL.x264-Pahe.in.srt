1
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,513
[air hissing]

2
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,686
[switch clicks]

3
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,984
[breath trembling]

4
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,164
[Walker] Rest easy, Eduardo.

5
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:46,546
I made you a promise when I found you
in that hole in Pena Dura.

6
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,507
And I intend to keep it.

7
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,845
To give you a true purpose

8
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,390
and the strength to see it through.

9
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:03,980
However, I'm afraid this process
will be agonizing

10
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:09,069
and unfortunately, quite lengthy.

11
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,239
Apologies in advance.

12
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,412
[rat squeaking]

13
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,835
[dial clicks]

14
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,259
[shuddering]

15
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,893
[breathing rapidly]

16
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,198
You're going to be reborn,

17
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,410
and then you'll be the bane of the unjust,

18
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,413
the bane of the corrupt,

19
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,626
the bane of anyone who opposes us.

20
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,424
[muffled screaming]

21
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,553
[screaming]

22
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:28,022
Radio confirmation,
General Wade's landing craft docked.

23
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,024
His convoy is on the way here now.

24
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,235
Reunification day is today.

25
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,029
Oh, that is great news, but then what?

26
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,323
Just 'cause we rebuilt some bridges

27
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,576
doesn't mean things are gonna
suddenly improve.

28
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,496
So, future got you spooked?

29
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,789
[sighs] Yeah, I guess.

30
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,375
I mean, I wanna believe
things are gonna get better,

31
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,419
but sometimes it's just hard for me
to see it, you know.

32
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,087
Can't say I understand.

33
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,256
I don't have kids,
at least none that I know of.

34
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,592
But, you got one coming.

35
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,261
So we got no choice but to believe.

36
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,514
It's gotta be better than what
we've been through, right?

37
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,600
[sighs] Damn well better be.

38
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,230
Seven days in a row of .07 water
toxicity levels.

39
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,232
Lucius' filters did the job.

40
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,901
Ah, good work. Hope it's not wasted.

41
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,611
Is there a reason to think
there's a problem?

42
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,154
Jim's got a lot on his mind,

43
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,780
what with Gotham rejoining the world

44
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,449
and a baby coming
into the world next week--

45
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,742
Give it a rest, Harvey.

46
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,243
All joking aside,

47
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,496
we are here because of you.

48
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,000
Hmm? And you're gonna be a father,
that's a future I'll take.

49
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,170
[officer] Yeah, well done.

50
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,464
[officer 2] Yeah. That's my boy.

51
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,675
Over the past year,

52
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,553
we've all done good work.

53
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,724
We've made Gotham a safe place
for kids and families.

54
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,186
We've given people
the food and medicine they needed.

55
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,147
But it's not over yet.

56
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,276
So no matter what General Wade says today,

57
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,613
the work continues.

58
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,034
Give yourselves one more
round of applause.

59
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,413
And get back to work.

60
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,632
Here they come.

61
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,109
[brakes squeal]

62
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,156
Captain Gordon.

63
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,117
Nice to finally meet you in the flesh.

64
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,828
General, welcome to Gotham.

65
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,956
Good that you've re-established some
semblance of law and order around here.

66
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,002
Seems like the Green Zone stretches
to every corner of the island.

67
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,129
General,

68
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,924
Wayne Labs show toxicity levels way below
the threshold the government set for us.

69
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,467
All due respect, Mr. Wayne,

70
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,387
but I got to go
with what my people tell me on this.

71
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,081
[Penguin] Cutting it a little close,
aren't we?

72
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,709
[Nygma] Is that under 27 pounds,
13 ounces?

73
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,045
It can't possibly make
that big a difference.

74
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,131
It's only the difference between getting
off this island

75
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,716
or sinking to the bottom of the river.

76
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,635
Well, then, Pengy can off-load
a few of his knick-knacks.

77
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,095
Not a chance.

78
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,265
Because, you know what's worth
its weight in gold?

79
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,017
Gold.

80
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,351
[groans]

81
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,606
[breathing heavily]

82
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,442
Congratulations!

83
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,401
[chuckles]

84
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,197
-Go to the clinic, go have your baby.
-Ugh.

85
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,949
What? So the two of you
can hightail it off this rock without me?

86
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,034
I don't think so.

87
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,329
I assure you
we will not launch without you.

88
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,290
Ed and I will finish making preparations
and we'll be ready to launch

89
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:17,376
the moment you get back here
with that little bundle of joy.

90
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,464
Or, unless I should
drive you to the clinic

91
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,049
in light of your delicate condition?

92
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,593
I can do it. I'm not that delicate.

93
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:30,389
Remember that, if you even think
about double-crossing me.

94
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,064
[Nygma] Very kind of you
to offer to drive her.

95
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,066
[Penguin] I knew she would
never accept my help.

96
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,237
Shall I start the engine?

97
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,780
One less passenger to worry about.

98
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,198
No, two actually.

99
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,950
You are so right.

100
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,618
[chuckles]

101
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,808
[gasps]

102
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:16,978
Found it.

103
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,063
Oh, well done, Miss Kyle.

104
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,108
Right, let's have a look.

105
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,486
Oh, well, here we are.

106
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:31,033
[Selina] Oh, so this guy's the architect
who designed Wayne Manor.

107
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,201
[Alfred] Yeah, that's right.

108
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,663
With the reunification,
a new Wayne Manor must follow.

109
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,373
[Alfred sniffs]

110
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,251
And it will be just like the old one.

111
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,712
Oh, nothing is just like it was.

112
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,842
So, why are we looking at the old plans?

113
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,304
Perhaps I'm not ready
to let go of the past.

114
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,603
Well, if it makes you feel better,
I wish I could blow up my past.

115
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,773
Well, maybe you will.

116
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,488
Then one day when you build something new,
the past will always be part of it.

117
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,408
As for me, now Master Bruce has grown,

118
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,621
building a new manor
might be my last great service to him.

119
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:19,916
A home.

120
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,877
And then what?

121
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,047
You retire?

122
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,008
No.

123
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,765
I will stand guard as I've always done.

124
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,976
[indistinct chatter]

125
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,897
[Harvey] I thought this was all settled.

126
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,065
This is bull.

127
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,650
My results are accurate, Jim.

128
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,985
[Harvey] We don't know this General,
maybe he's with Walker.

129
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,445
Let's not get carried away.

130
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,988
Bruce, go and check on the tech.

131
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,158
[police radio beeps, crackles]

132
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,117
[sighs]

133
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,911
This is Gordon.

134
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,746
[over radio] <i>It's Lee.</i>

135
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,790
<i>Everything okay?</i>

136
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,461
-Barbara just showed up here, in labor.
-[breathing heavily]

137
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,712
You're kidding.

138
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,589
<i>You better come quick.</i>

139
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,929
Are you okay?

140
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,182
Yeah, yeah.

141
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,895
[Gordon] <i>I'll try to get over there
as soon as I can.</i>

142
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,189
<i>Try to...</i>

143
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,148
Um...

144
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,484
Try to wait for me.

145
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,945
It doesn't really work that way.

146
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,738
I know.

147
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,991
Okay.

148
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,159
<i>Wait...</i>

149
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,580
I love you.

150
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,710
I love you, too.

151
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,044
Jim!

152
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,755
What? What's wrong?

153
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,173
We did it.

154
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,883
You did it. We got through it, Jim.

155
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,176
[General Wade] Captain.

156
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,555
All clear, congratulations.

157
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,682
Reunification can begin.

158
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,061
Well, I'm glad I can make you so happy.

159
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,772
Funny thing is, sir,

160
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,525
that's just the second best news
I've got today.

161
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,736
[rumbling]

162
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,862
What's that?

163
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,406
-[gun fires]
-[gas hissing]

164
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,158
-Jim?
-Incoming!

165
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,537
Everybody, get back!

166
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,122
Get inside!

167
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,248
Get inside!

168
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,375
-[soldier] Take cover!
-[engine revving]

169
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,421
[Gordon] Go! Go!

170
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,601
[automatic guns firing]

[heavy breathing continues]

178
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,294
Not anymore.

180
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,410
[Harvey] All right, people! Listen up!

I want squads headed for Knights Stadium,
Yeavely Park and Granton Station.

182
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,043
Work your way out.
We gotta find 'em, people.

183
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,422
What the bloody hell happened?

184
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,800
Seems that Jim's old army buddy
wasn't quite as dead as we'd hoped.

185
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,718
I got squads covering the North Side.

186
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,679
They're sweeping from Coventry,
down to Miller Harbor

187
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,930
but they could be anywhere.

188
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,057
Well, give us an area to search,
we'll get it covered.

189
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,436
Uh, take Reatton,
work your way to South City Park.

190
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,188
Looks like you're not done
protecting Bruce yet, Alfred.

191
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,653
[breathing heavily]

192
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,118
Eduardo.

193
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,496
What did Walker do to you?

194
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:35,171
When I was in Pena Dura prison, Jim,
the guards played a game.

195
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,174
They'd choose one of us

196
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,717
and they buried us alive.

197
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,053
They'd take bets on whether
you can dig your way out,

198
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,973
but then, they'd bury you deeper,

199
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,392
and play again.

200
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,812
I was the champion.

201
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,065
To survive that,

202
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,776
I had to stop being human.

203
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,907
I had to become something else.

204
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,368
I became Bane.

205
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,164
Only, I didn't know it yet,

206
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,959
but she knew and she showed me the way.

207
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,129
If the world is full of monsters,

208
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:21,550
the only way to defeat them
is to become one yourself.

209
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,762
I'm sorry.

210
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,223
You were a good soldier.

211
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,600
[sighs]

212
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,143
Don't pity me, Jim.

213
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,355
We are building the future.

214
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,691
She's given me a purity of mission,

215
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,444
and unlike the army,
she is willing to carry things out.

216
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,823
A new world is coming.

217
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,076
Strong,

218
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,205
merciless, unyielding.

219
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,082
I've heard it all before.

220
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,292
Not gonna happen.

221
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,506
And how are you going to stop me, Jim?

222
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,632
Not me.

223
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,969
You kidnapped Bruce Wayne
and a general of the U.S. Army.

224
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,805
You talk about your future, Eduardo,
but you don't have one.

225
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,641
But Eduardo's dead, Jim.

226
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,812
There is only Bane now.

227
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,272
[door opens]

228
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,775
Rise.

229
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,988
I said, rise!

230
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,866
[Walker] Not so formal.

231
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,993
Captain and I are acquainted.

232
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,997
Get the other one.

233
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,588
I recognize your voice,
but I don't know what to call you.

234
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,507
I know it's not "Walker."

235
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,051
So who are you?

236
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,805
That's a good question.

237
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,894
Perhaps Bruce Wayne
can help us figure that one out.

238
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,520
[Bruce panting]

239
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,650
You okay?

240
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,611
Yeah.

241
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,239
[Gordon] You want hostages?

242
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,075
You've got me
and a general of the U.S. Army.

243
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,327
Let him go.

244
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,912
This has nothing to do with him.

245
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,081
"This has nothing to do with him"?

246
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,543
But, Captain,
you don't even know what "this" is.

247
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:26,258
"This," everything I have done here,
is about punishing Gotham.

248
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,678
For the sins of Bruce Wayne.

249
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,265
You can start now.

250
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,896
No, no!

251
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,732
[Gordon grunting]

252
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,443
[Walker] And again.

253
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,195
[Gordon groans]

254
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,782
So,

255
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,117
Bruce Wayne.

256
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,245
I'm thinking of a name.

257
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,831
Can you guess whose it is?

258
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,124
What?

259
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,668
Wrong.

260
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,252
And again.

261
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,212
[groans]

262
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,173
Wanna take another guess?

263
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,556
Farewell, my beloved Gotham.

264
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,476
City of my birth.

265
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,647
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

266
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,943
Though I leave you today,

267
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,321
my heart will always remain.

268
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,825
I do so hate goodbyes.

269
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,451
Well, you're in luck.
We're not going anywhere.

270
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,245
-What are you talking about?
-Engine won't start.

271
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,831
Pressure regulator valve's missing.
Or rather, it's stolen.

272
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:46,171
Barbara!

273
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,840
[Barbara breathing heavily]

274
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,342
[Lee] Blood pressure's normal.

275
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,595
I'm glad something about this is normal.

276
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,598
So, how long
is this gonna take, Doc, soup to nuts?

277
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,726
Are you in a hurry or something?

278
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,353
No, it's just that, uh...

279
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,315
I just feel like you've been
so great about this.

280
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,943
You know,
it's been awkward as hell for you and...

281
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,738
I haven't even really said, "Thank you."

282
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,698
I don't expect a thank-you
from you, Barbara.

283
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,867
Then perhaps the best thank-you
would be for me to get out

284
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,201
of here as soon as possible.

285
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:24,084
Whatever's on your mind,
the health of the baby comes first.

286
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,754
I know that.

287
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,006
So, long haul or short, we're here

288
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,799
until you have
a healthy baby in your arms.

289
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,385
That's all I want.

290
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,346
Okay.

291
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,731
[sighs]

292
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,941
-[bone cracks, groans]
-Stop it!

293
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,862
-A name, a person.
-[breathing heavily]

294
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,864
The reason this is all happening.

295
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,992
Can't you guess yet?

296
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,286
I don't know!

297
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,960
-[yells]
-If you wanna punish me, then do it.

298
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,462
Hurt me, not him.

299
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,006
I am hurting you.

300
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:16,220
There's nothing more painful
than seeing your friend suffer.

301
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,557
But, he's more than just a friend,
isn't he, Bruce?

302
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,103
Jim Gordon's been like a father to you.

303
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:30,275
How awful it must be
to watch another father die.

304
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,572
Who am I doing this for?

305
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,366
Say the name.

306
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,494
[groans]

307
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:42,788
[whimpers]

308
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,918
When the ones you love die,

309
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:52,798
it's like a part of yourself
is cut off forever.

310
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,174
[Bruce inhales sharply]

311
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,885
You know that.

312
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,390
So why do I hate you so much?

313
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,143
Who was cut away from me?

314
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,353
Last chance.

315
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,396
[groans weakly]

316
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,164
Yes.

317
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,916
Now you know.

318
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,379
Say his name.

319
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,173
Say it.

320
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,508
Ra's al Ghul.

321
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,221
This is revenge for his death.

322
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,059
And who am I?

323
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,521
You're his daughter.

324
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,695
My name is Nyssa al Ghul.

325
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,575
And revenge is just the beginning
of what I want.

326
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,462
[Nyssa] The League of Shadows
is everywhere.

327
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,673
Did you think my father's mission
would die with him?

328
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:21,136
Humankind will be purged of weakness.

329
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:25,015
I'm just starting with you and yours.

330
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,063
You're right. I killed Ra's.

331
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,985
So, whatever you need to do, do it to me.

332
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:45,035
No. You can't take all the blame
for killing my father.

333
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:49,623
I mean, you did have some help, right?

334
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:55,212
Someone who, quite literally,
gave you a helping hand.

335
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,382
What are you doing?

336
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,133
-[grunting]
-[grunts]

337
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,808
Well done, Barbara.

338
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,190
Go get Barbara Kean.

339
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:18,777
Eduardo...

340
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,657
She's pregnant.

341
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,702
She's carrying a child.

342
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,538
[Bane] A child?

343
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:35,335
One soul's future
weighed against the world's.

344
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,631
Your concern seems petty, Jim.

345
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:48,473
If he touches a hair on that child's head,
I will destroy everything you have.

346
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,059
I don't have anything left.

347
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,561
Just my father's mission.

348
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,694
Bane wants you
to join that mission with us.

349
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,365
To see the world as he sees it.

350
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,200
Never.

351
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,828
[Strange] Never say never, Captain Gordon.

352
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:10,787
No!

353
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,543
[Nyssa] How does it feel, Bruce,

354
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,963
knowing that all of this is your fault?

355
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,761
Tell me. I'd really like to know.

356
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,764
[Barbara screaming]

357
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,932
[breathing heavily]

358
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,059
[moans]

359
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,228
There must be something you can give me.

360
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,022
We're out of the drugs that you need.

361
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,816
It's okay. You're almost there.

362
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,109
I'll get you some ice chips

363
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,278
-so you don't get dehydrated.
-Gee, thanks.

364
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,535
-Lee.
-Ed.

365
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,622
Don't worry. I'm not here for you.

366
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,835
But for the record, you stabbed me first.

367
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,839
If you two are quite done,
we are actually here for Barbara.

368
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:07,052
Or more precisely, what she stole from us.

369
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,346
I don't know what this is about.
And I don't care.

370
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,806
You two need to get out of here right now.

371
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:15,143
[chuckles] Gladly. Just as soon
as Barbara gives us the...

372
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,813
-What's it called?
-Pressure regulator valve.

373
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,564
Right. That.

374
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,194
I should've known
that you would try to screw us over.

375
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:27,739
You only noticed because
you tried to screw me over first.

376
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,533
Second, technically.

377
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,785
Okay. She's in the middle
of having a baby.

378
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,788
And we are in the middle of
trying to leave Gotham.

379
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:38,875
And we can't do that
without a crucial part of the submarine,

380
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,002
which will ferry us all away from here!

381
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,171
That's why you were in such a rush
to get out of here.

382
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,548
[Penguin] As are we.

383
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,844
Hand over the part.

384
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:50,720
Now.

385
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,597
Don't point that at the baby.

386
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,308
What? No, I did not.

387
00:23:56,643 --> 00:24:00,689
I was merely trying to make a general
threatening gesture with a firearm--

388
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,190
But you did, though.
You pointed the gun at the baby.

389
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,568
All right, fine. I'm sorry!

390
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,611
Now give us what we want!

391
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,072
Oh, you think I'm stupid enough
to have the part on me?

392
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,241
It's hidden away somewhere safe.

393
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:14,661
And if you think you can
torture me into telling you where,

394
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:20,167
there is literally nothing more painful
than what I'm going through right now!

395
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,711
[explosion, rumbling]

396
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:23,712
[woman screams in distance]

397
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,133
[nurse] Hey! You stay out of here!
This is a hospital!

398
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,092
[bone snapping]

399
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:31,761
[bell dings]

400
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,513
[P.A. system activates]

401
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:39,019
Barbara Kean, your time is up.

402
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,771
<i>There's no place for you to hide.</i>

403
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,609
<i>No one will save you
nor mercy that will spare you. </i>

404
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,779
You simply cannot run from your sins.

405
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,240
And you cannot run from me.

406
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,127
What do you want from me?

407
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:12,302
Let me let you in
on a little military secret.

408
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:17,390
It's called Special Order 386.

409
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,519
In the event that Gotham
is irretrievably lost,

410
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:27,859
a contingency plan was put in place
to reduce this city to rubble.

411
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,074
No. There are still innocent people here.

412
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,618
You asked me what I want from you.

413
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,998
I want you to suffer, Bruce Wayne,

414
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,293
and then I want you to die.

415
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,633
Spend a little time with that thought.

416
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,428
We'll be starting soon.

417
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,063
-[Lee] Who are those guys?
-[Barbara] No idea.

418
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,649
[Lee] Exactly how many people
have you screwed over?

419
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,943
-[Penguin] Present company excluded?
-[Barbara whimpering]

420
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,112
[Lee] There are 79 people
in this building.

421
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,072
[Nygma] Fortunately, they seem to only be
trying to kill one.

422
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,908
So, by all means,
let's gather around the target.

423
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:17,867
-[Lee] All right.
-[Barbara groaning]

424
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,661
Maybe we can
cut through the abandoned wing

425
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,746
and we can get to
the ambulance bay that way.

426
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,789
Might take some time, but--

427
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,417
Oh, if only there were two able-bodied men
who could buy us some!

428
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,211
And why, pray tell,
should we risk our necks for you?

429
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,463
-[wincing] Chivalry!
-[Penguin laughing]

430
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,590
But if that's too much,
remember, if I die,

431
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,468
-you will never find that sub part.
-[Nygma] Fine.

432
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,763
We'll keep them busy.
We'll meet you at the docks.

433
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,598
Thank you.

434
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,605
-What?
-"Keep them busy"?

435
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,233
I only brought enough ammunition
for a light firefight,

436
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,736
not to repel a paramilitary assault!

437
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,863
What do we use? Bedpans?

438
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:59,492
I was actually thinking of something
a little more flammable.

439
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,205
[both laugh]

440
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:14,841
[grunts]

441
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:38,114
Why, Captain Gordon,
how nice that you're awake.

442
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,326
Picked the losing side, Strange.

443
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,496
The Army's coming to Gotham.

444
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,874
Help me, and you can do what you do best,

445
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,043
survive.

446
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:54,964
I happen to think more of
Miss al Ghul's chances for success

447
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:59,552
than a man in your, well, position.

448
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,431
You really think
she can take on the entire Army?

449
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,100
As a matter of fact, I do.

450
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,519
With my help.

451
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:15,068
You are just a few modifications away
from being a mighty soldier in her forces.

452
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,530
Not unlike your friend, Eduardo,

453
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,575
I will help you
to realize your full potential.

454
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,995
Give you true strength.

455
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:27,789
I'll pass.

456
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,334
Consent is hardly a prerequisite.

457
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:37,799
We will begin with,
uh, physical improvements.

458
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,221
Sorry.

459
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,432
And finish

460
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,603
with certain mental adjustments.

461
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:54,941
[elevator bell dings]

462
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,402
[regulated breathing]

463
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,375
[exclaiming]

464
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,713
[breathing continues]

465
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,610
[Lee] Your contractions
are about a minute apart.

466
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,694
-We gotta get you out of here.
-[Barbara grunting]

467
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,030
-[yelling]
-[man grunts]

468
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,199
[Barbara screams]

469
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,242
[Lee] Nice shot.

470
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:48,787
[yelling]

471
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,164
-[Lee exclaims]
-[screaming]

472
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,832
-[groaning]
-Keep breathing!

473
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,445
[grunts]

474
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,409
[chair creaking]

475
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,393
[Nygma] Some try to hide,
some try to cheat,

476
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,687
but time will let us always meet.
What am I?

477
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,107
-Pregnant lady with a gun?
-Death. But close enough.

478
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,277
[Penguin] So, where to now?

479
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:06,739
Well, I believe we have a sub to catch.

480
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:07,866
[both chuckling]

481
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,284
How long have you had that?

482
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,661
Long enough to know
she'd never let it out of her sight.

483
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:12,871
[laughing]

484
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,210
And you stuck around long enough

485
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,505
to risk both of our lives
to save Barbara's?

486
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,301
Or was it to protect Lee?

487
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,179
Do you want me to answer that,
or do you want to sail away from here?

488
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,556
Bon voyage.

489
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,982
[screaming] Those bastards have stolen
the damn sub part!

490
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,651
-You mean they stole it back.
-Whose side are you on?

491
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,446
-Clearly, I'm on the baby's side, Barbara.
-[breathing heavily]

492
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,865
What was your plan, anyway?

493
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,410
You were going to be a fugitive
with Nygma and Penguin?

494
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,954
Well, I'm not exactly the stay-at-home
and bake-apple-pie type.

495
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,666
Yeah, and running off on a submarine
seemed like a great alternative.

496
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,213
Barbara.

497
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,800
You can live here.
You can have this baby here.

498
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,136
Jim is not taking the baby away from you.

499
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,389
You really believe that?

500
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:19,354
You really think Captain Jim Gordon
is gonna let a criminal raise his kid?

501
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,611
People are already shooting at my baby.

502
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,073
I have to protect him, or her.

503
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,533
I have to be strong.

504
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,579
Hey. Being strong does not mean
you have to be a criminal.

505
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,041
Jim will help you.

506
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,586
And so will I, if you'll let me.

507
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,672
That's just weird.

508
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,215
I know.

509
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,468
Hey, baby, this is your Aunty Lee.

510
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,594
Mommy tried to kill her once,

511
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,054
-maybe twice.
-[laughing]

512
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,599
All right, okay. That's enough of that.
Come on, we gotta keep moving.

513
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,602
I think this is happening now.

514
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,939
[screaming]

515
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,566
[whimpering]

516
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,526
[breathing heavily]

517
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,163
[straining]

518
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,129
[screams]

519
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,463
[henchman] What's going on in there?

520
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,634
[grunts]

521
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,019
This is Bruce Wayne. Can anyone read me?

522
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,189
[grunts]

523
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,776
This is Bruce Wayne.
Does anyone at the GCPD read me?

524
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,155
<i>This is Bruce Wayne. Can anyone read me? </i>

525
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,616
Bruce, it's Alfred.
Where the devil are you? Over.

526
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,619
Some abandoned mansion in North Side Park.

527
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,039
-On my way.
-No. I'll get out myself.

528
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,498
I need you to get to the clinic.

529
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,499
The clinic?

530
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,126
<i>It's Ra's al Ghul's daughter, Alfred.</i>

531
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,671
<i>She wants revenge.
She mutated Eduardo Dorrance, </i>

532
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,173
<i>and sent him after Barbara.</i>

533
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,174
[Selina] Oh, gosh.

534
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,925
I'm fine.

535
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,512
I need you to get to Barbara and the baby.

536
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,642
Now, you're going to feel
a slight discomfort.

537
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:25,229
That's the stimulant I've given you
to prepare your muscles.

538
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,356
You'll need it for what comes next,

539
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,819
which, I'm afraid,
is going to be excruciating.

540
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,242
[grunts]

541
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,374
Do you feel that?

542
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,169
Yes.

543
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,421
[Strange groans]

544
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:54,842
[grunts]

545
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:11,067
There's that fighting spirit
I've always admired so much.

546
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,612
Now, if you'll excuse me,
there's an alarm I must sound.

547
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,571
[grunts]

548
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,031
[door opens]

549
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,874
What the hell are you doing?

550
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:30,294
Checking to make sure Strange doesn't have
one of those chips in your head.

551
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,881
We need to hurry up.
Get out of here before he trips the alarm.

552
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,508
[alarm buzzes, blares in distance]

553
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,301
Come on.

554
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,976
Alfred and GCPD
are on their way to the clinic.

555
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,936
-Where's Nyssa?
-I don't know.

556
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,689
But she's planning on using the military
to wipe out Gotham.

557
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,858
I can order them to stand down.

558
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,026
Now let's get you out of here.

559
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:05,246
[Lee] She's beautiful. Congratulations.

560
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,415
[Barbara] Hi, there.

561
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,626
Guess I'm gonna have to figure out
what to call you.

562
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,836
[Barbara sobbing]

563
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,338
Thank you.

564
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:27,852
[baby crying]

565
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:29,937
[tires screech]

566
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,026
[Lee gasps]

567
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,612
[car doors open]

568
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,615
-[Selina] Come on.
-[Alfred] Get in the car now!

569
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,574
I'll hold him off.

570
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,284
[Selina] Alfred and I got this.

571
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,037
[Alfred] Selina, get in the car.

572
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,872
-Selina, get back in the car!
-No!

573
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,332
Go.

574
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,835
Oh, my, look at you.
You're a big one, ain't you?

575
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,755
Bloody baby.
But let's see what you got.

576
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,298
[Alfred grunting]

577
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,595
[Selina groans]

578
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,764
[grunting]

579
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,902
Ugh, bastard.

580
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:18,861
[Alfred yelling]

581
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,864
[yells]

582
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,000
[Selina groans]

583
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,545
No!

584
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,131
Alfred!

585
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:41,968
Alfred.

586
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,389
Alfred.

587
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,017
Somebody help!

588
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,021
Somebody... Oh, no.

589
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,500
[soldier] Attention!

590
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,758
[soldier 2] Welcome back, General.

591
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,928
Get me a secure line to the mainland now.

592
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,056
[Harvey] Jim! Hey.

593
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,434
Just got word from Lee.

594
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,437
She and Barbara
made it out of the clinic okay.

595
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,856
And your baby daughter, too.

596
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,986
-Congratulations.
-They're going to The Sirens.

597
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,948
You just had a baby girl, brother.
Say something.

598
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,790
I just can't believe it.

599
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,460
We won, didn't we? It's over.

600
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,588
We did, and she's gonna have
a better world because of it.

601
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,756
She is.

602
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,549
I promise.

603
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,926
-Is Alfred with them?
-Didn't say.

604
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,803
This is General Wade.

605
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:13,267
I am authorizing Special Order 386.

606
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,393
No!

607
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:18,773
Gotham City is lost.
Begin your bombing run on my order.

608
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,691
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Arrest them.

609
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,859
[guns cocking]

610
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,944
[Bruce] You can't do this.

611
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,237
Take them away.

612
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,864
You can't do this!

613
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,828
[Lee] Okay. Nice and slow.

614
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,679
-[Nyssa] Barbara Kean.
-[gasps] Run!

615
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,895
It's nice to finally meet you.

616
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,315
My name is Nyssa al Ghul.

617
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,112
I believe you knew my father.

618
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,787
I don't understand how
the general could have been chipped.

619
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,705
I didn't see a scar
on the back of his neck. Did you?

620
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,499
No. Strange must've hidden it.

621
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,875
Nyssa let us escape.

622
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,795
She knew we'd bring the general here
and do her dirty work for her.

623
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,177
-[Harvey] What now, Jim?
-Son...

624
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,638
If you're gonna stick a gun in my face,

625
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,641
you should at least know
you're doing it wrong.

626
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,435
[soldier grunts]

627
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,354
Come on. Let's go.

628
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,648
[helicopters whirring]

629
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,286
[explosions continue in the distance]
