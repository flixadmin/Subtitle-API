00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,749
<i>Relax.</i>

166
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,955
<i>Tell me your dreams.</i>

<i>Tell me your fantasies.</i>

<i>Tell me your secrets.</i>

169
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,674
<i>Tell me...</i>

170
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,236
<i>your deepest, darkest...</i>

No. No!

TWO-FACE: Relax, folks!

174
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,756
It's only an old-fashioned
low-tech stickup!

175
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,796
We're interested in the basics!

176
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,156
Cash, jewelry, cellular telephones.

177
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,789
Hand them over nice and quietly,
and no one will be hurt.

178
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,392
Emergency, Alfred.

179
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,348
Yes, sir?

180
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,718
Be calm, everybody!

181
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,558
Just be calm!

182
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,914
Excuse me!

183
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,471
You're ruining my big party!
Are you insane?

184
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,438
We're sick of waiting for you
to deliver the Batman, dear boy.

185
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,476
Patience, O Bifurcated One.

186
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,437
Patience, hell, we want him dead!

187
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,069
And nothing brings out the Batman
like a little murder and mayhem!

188
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,435
The least you could have done
is let me in on the caper.

189
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,672
We could have organized this, planned it,
pre-sold the movie rights.

[Glass shattering]

191
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,514
Batman!

192
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,389
Your entrance was good, his was better.

193
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,748
The difference? Showmanship.

194
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,878
Emergency, Alfred.

195
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,350
Oh, sir. I could be fired for this, sir.

196
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,549
Perhaps they'll have me back
at Buckingham Palace.

197
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,949
All right, boys! Phase Two!

198
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,956
My place, midnight.

199
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,478
Nothing like a bad case of gas!

200
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,709
Why can't you just die?

201
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,909
Hi.

202
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,232
What the hell did you think
you were doing?

203
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,959
You got a real gratitude problem,
you know that, Bruce?

204
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,508
I need a name. Batboy? Nightwing?

205
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,239
I don't know, what do you think?
What's a good sidekick name?

206
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,311
How about
"Dick Grayson, college student"?

207
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,119
Screw you. I just saved your life.
You owe me.

208
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,078
You were totally out of control.
You're going to get yourself killed.

209
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,594
- You're looking at your new partner.
- No.

210
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,636
Whenever you go out at night,
I'll be watching.

211
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,439
And wherever Batman goes,
I'm gonna be right beside him.

212
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,829
I mean, how are you gonna stop me?

213
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,399
I can stop you.

214
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,309
[Clears throat]

215
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,234
Al, hang this next to the Batsuit...

216
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,478
where it belongs.

217
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,710
And you're encouraging him.

218
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,349
Young men with a mind for revenge
need little encouragement.

219
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,158
They need guidance.

220
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,712
You, above all, should know
the consequences of the life you choose.

221
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,640
Even Chase calls being Batman a curse.

222
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,079
Perhaps the lady's just what
the doctor ordered.

223
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,435
She seems lovely and wise.

224
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,273
I've never been in love before, Alfred.

225
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,279
Go to her.

226
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,472
Tell her how you feel.

227
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,994
She wants Batman, not Bruce Wayne.

228
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,832
Let the lady decide.

229
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,114
I'm sorry.

230
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,758
I can't believe this.

231
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,718
I've imagined this moment
since I first saw you.

232
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,918
Your eyes.

233
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,639
Your lips.

234
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,759
Your body.

235
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,591
And now I have you...

236
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,753
and I'm wishing you were somebody else.

237
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,713
I guess a girl has to grow up sometime.

238
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,118
I've met someone.

239
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,153
He's not you.

240
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,276
I hope you can understand.

241
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,033
I understand.

242
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,948
Well...

243
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,276
That's just what I said.

244
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,519
Then I taught my doggie a new trick:

245
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,036
How to map the human mind.

246
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,994
Would you like to see what our old friend
Bruce Wayne has in his head?

247
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,798
Riddle me this.

248
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,633
What kind of man has bats on the brain?

249
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,600
- Go ahead. You can say it.
- You're a genius.

250
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,398
Oh, stop.

251
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,431
So, from this day on...

252
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,672
Batman is no more.

253
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,593
You can't just quit. I mean...

254
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,831
there's monsters out there.
Batman has to protect the innocent.

255

I've dedicated my life
to helping strangers I've never met.

256

Faces I've never seen.

257
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,311
Well, the innocent aren't
faceless anymore.

258
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,752
You can't tell me what I'm gonna do
with the rest of my life.

259
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,752
My dad told me
that every man goes his own way.

260
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,796
My way goes to Two-Face.

261
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,952
You gotta help me.

262
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,511
And if you do find Harvey...

263
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,989
and then you kill him, what next?

264
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,228
Exactly.

265
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,995
Then you'd be alone, like me.

No, you've got to let this go.

Listen to me, Dick. I'm your friend.

268
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,598
I don't need a friend right now, all right?
I need a partner.

269

Two-Face has got to pay.

Please.

271
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,555

- Happy Halloween.
- Happy Halloween to you.

I asked you here tonight...

277
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,751
because there's something
that I wanted to tell you.

278
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,990
I wanted to tell you something, too.

I have been attracted
to a certain kind of man.

The wrong kind of man.

for a living, right?

Oh, God.

Bruce, what are you trying to tell me?

328
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,912
Chase, I'm...

329
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,228
Twick or tweet!

330
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,429
Trick.

331
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,758
Remember the plan.

332
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,751
Seize and capture.

333
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,232
- No killing.
- That goes double for you.

RIDDLER: "Intruder alert!"

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,233
Shut up!

340
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,833
Now, that's impressive!

341
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,878
You know, it's always risky introducing
a tamed animal into the wild.

342
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,713
They may have trouble adapting

No!

349
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,638
Don't kill him.

350
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,792
If you kill him...

00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,196

Master Bruce.

354
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,671
How are you, young man?

355
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,598
You haven't called me that for a long time.

Old habits die hard.

Are you all right?

00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,070
- Where's Chase?
- I'm afraid they've taken Dr. Meridian.

359

Master Dick has run away.

The cave has been destroyed.

361

And there's another riddle.

I'm coming, my sweet.

have in common?

380
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,199
What do these riddles mean?

381
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,397
Every riddle has a number in the question
and they arrived in this order:

382
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,870
13, 1, 8, and 5.

383
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,394
ALFRED: 13, 1, 8, and 5.

384
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,708
What do they mean?

385
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,756
Perhaps letters of the alphabet?

386
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,751
Of course, 13 is "M."

387
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,150
1 would be "A," 8 would be "H"
and 5 would be "E."

388
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,196
"M-A-H-E."

389
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,634
Perhaps 1 and 8 are 18.

390
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,310
18 is "R."

391
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,118
"M-R-E."

392
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,390
How about "Mr. E"?

393
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,870
- Mystery?
- And another name for mystery?

Edward Nygma.

397
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,234
Stickley's suicide was obviously
a computer-generated forgery.

398
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,676
You really are quite bright,
despite what people say.

Are all the Batsuits destroyed, Alfred?

00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,278
All except the prototype
with the sonar modifications you invented.

401

What do you suggest, Alfred? By sea...

404
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,239
or by air?

405
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,593
Why not both?

Who's your tailor?

I took the liberty, sir.

408
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,355
"R"? What's that stand for?

Robin.

410
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,878
Riddler and Two-Face can make
a pretty lethal combination.

411
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,757
I figured you could use a hand.

412
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,229
Two against two are better odds.

I can't promise I won't kill Harvey.

A man's got to go his own way.

415
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,516
A friend taught me that.

416
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,712
Not just a friend.

417
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,159
A partner.

418
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,672
He's not coming.

419
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,713
Shut it down.

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,312
Wait a minute!

00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,793
Go.

the real game begins.

Holy rusted metal, Batman!

439
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,877
The ground, it's all metal.

440
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,474
It's full of holes, you know. Holey.

441
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,519
Robin, wait.

442
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,799
The whole island's moving.

443
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,593
Looking for us?

444
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,351
That was for my mother!

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,358
And this is for me.

448
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,790
Finally, justice is served!

449
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,433
Let us die!

Oh, good boy.

Noble. Stupid...

456

but noble.

457
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,557
Riddle me this.

Riddle me that.

459

Who's afraid of the big black bat?

00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,997
No more tricks, Edward.

461
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,672
Very well, then.

462
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,952
Let's get real.

463
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,270
Release Chase.
This is between you and me.

464
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,874
And me. And me!

465
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,910
You've been sucking Gotham's
brain waves...

466
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,468
and now you've devised a way
to read men's minds.

467
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,073
You betcha!

468
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,751
Soon my little Box will be on
countless TVs around the world...

471
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,836
Into my head they'll go.

472
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,310
Victory is inevitable.

473
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,830
For if knowledge is power...

474
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,678
then a God am...

475
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,834
I!

476
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,793
Was that over the top? I can never tell.

477
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,753
By the way, I've seen your mind, freak!

478
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,277
Yours is the greatest riddle of all.

479
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,319
Can Bruce Wayne and Batman
ever truly coexist?

480
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,517
We'll find out today!

481
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,594
But first, let's meet our contestants.

482
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,350
Behind curtain...

483
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,000
number one...

484
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,358
the absolutely fabulous
Dr. Chase Meridian.

485
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,716
She enjoys hiking, getting her nails done...

486
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,076
and foolishly hopes to be
the love of Bruce's life.

487
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,594
And behind curtain number two...

488
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,955
Fatman's one and only partner.

489
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,393
This acrobat turned orphan...

490
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,314
likes Saturday morning cartoons
and dreams of one day being...

491
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,915
bare naked with a girl.

492
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,356
And below these contestants...

493
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,237
my personal favorite:

494
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,155
A watery grave!

495
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,756
Just one little touch...

496
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,952
and five seconds later
these two day-players are...

497
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,235
gull feed on the rocks below.

498
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,794
Not enough time to save them both.

499
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,035
Which one will it be, Batman?

500
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,553
Bruce's love?

501
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,518
Or the Dark Knight's junior partner?

502
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,438
[Imitating clock ticking]

503
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,192
There is no way for me
to save them or myself.

504
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,234
This is all one giant deathtrap.

505
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,514
Judges?

506
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,351
I'm sorry. Your answer must be
in the form of a question.

507
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,000
- But thank you for playing.
- Wait.

508
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,840
- I have a riddle for you.
- For me?

509
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,199
Really?

510
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,268
Tell me.

511
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,637
I see without seeing.

512
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,997
To me, darkness is as clear as daylight.

513
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,959
What am I?

514
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,598
Please!

515
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,149
You're as blind as a bat!

516
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,908
Exactly.

517
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,354
Bummer.

518
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,314
Thanks.

519
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,791
All those heroics for nothing.

520
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,792
No more riddles,
no more curtains one and two.

521
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,711
Just plain curtains.

522
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,515
Aren't you forgetting something, Harvey?

523
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,919
Your coin.

524
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,954
You're always of two minds
about everything.

525
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,949
Yes, of course. You're right, Bruce.

526
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,917
Emotion's always the enemy
of true justice.

527
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,639
Thank you.
You've always been a good friend.

528
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,349
[Exclaiming]

529
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,749
Why?

530
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,032
Why can't I kill you?

531
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,558
Too many questions.

532
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,951
Too many questions.

533
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,759
Poor Edward.

534
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,316
I had to save them both.

535
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,473
You see,
I'm both Bruce Wayne and Batman.

536
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,031
Not because I have to be.

537
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,197
Now, because I choose to be.

538
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,591
DR. BURTON: Thank you for responding to
my request for a consultation, Dr. Meridian.

539
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,593
Edward Nygma has been screaming
for hours...

540
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,468
that he knows the true identity of Batman.

541
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,954
Edward?

542
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,669
Who...

543
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,593
is it?

544
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,151
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase.

545
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,478
Do you remember me?

546
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,838
How could I forget?

547
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,431
Dr. Burton tells me...

548
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,311
you know who Batman is.

549
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,998
I can't tell you if you don't say "please."

550
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,433
Edward, please. Who is Batman?

551
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,914
I'm Batman.

552
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,999
[Laughing maniacally]

553
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,032
Your secret is safe.

554
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,629
He is definitely a wacko.

555
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,949
Wacko. Is that a technical term?

556
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,434
Listen...

557
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,915
I won't be needing this anymore.

558
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,434
Thank you for giving me a new dream.

559
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,432
Don't work too late.
