1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,119
My name is Captain Swing,
calling from the occupied Six Counties.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,993
This Michael, your kin,

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,430
making deals with the very men
who want you dead.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,631
What happened on that ship?

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,878
Said the men from Glasgow
were called Billy Boys.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,790
Protestant razor gang.
They run every man east of Glasgow.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,719
We have a mutual acquaintance.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,639
These gentlemen are the Billy Boys.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,398
I'm Jimmy.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,959
I need Mr Shelby to understand that
his best is not good enough.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,278
Your body will be the lesson.

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,879
Tommy, what are you talking about?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,118
I'm talking about an empty chair, Ada.

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,675
My chair. My throne.

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,633
People think that I'm gonna fall,
they start to circle.

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,199
Who's gonna take the throne, eh?

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,755
Black cat dreams are never wrong.

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,520
They crucified my son...

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,679
...for you.

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,837
Good morning, sisters.

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,199
Let us pray.

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,916
Our Father, who art in heaven...

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,558
...but deliver us from evil...

24
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,829
...for thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory, for ever and ever...

25
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,520
...Amen.

26
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,677
You wanted to speak to us, Mr Shelby?

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,279
Yeah.

28
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,277
- All of us?
- Yeah.

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,119
At 6.30 in the morning?

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,038
Yes.

31
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,354
- We don't smoke in here.
- Well, I fucking do.

32
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,109
Nor do we use language.

33
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,278
Nor do we find fault in the innocent.

34
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,629
Yet you do.

35
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,115
You fucking do.

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,196
May I ask what this meeting is about?

37
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,597
The Grace Shelby Foundation
is the biggest single source of funding

38
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,915
for this charitable institution,

39
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,192
devoted to the care of the orphaned girls
of south Birmingham, yeah?

40
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,549
For which we give thanks.

41
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,436
I have a temper similar to the one
described in that report.

42
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,393
Yet, unlike you,
I wait until I'm matched in size.

43
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,557
Whose report?

44
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,157
The testimony of children.

45
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,356
Who have they spoken to?

46
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,360
- You'd have them only speak to God.
- God be their witness.

47
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,677
There is God,
and there are the Peaky Blinders.

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,110
This is Sparkhill, we're in Small Heath.

49
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,039
We are much, much closer at hand than God.

50
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,959
And we have heard terrible things.

51
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,119
We have in this place
children of the worst sort.

52
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,958
They lie as easily as breathe.

53
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,278
You had a child half black,
you made her wash with a different soap.

54
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,752
Mr Shelby, your own sins are legend.

55
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,439
Our sins...

56
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:07,354
Our sins against the beating of children
with bricks and hoses.

57
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,879
Our sins.

58
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,880
Our sins...

59
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,157
...against a black child
who hanged herself

60
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,793
for fear of your temper.

61
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,833
- I do not see how...
- You do not see!

62
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,553
Now put 'em on.

63
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,114
Put 'em on your face,

64
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,277
or it'll be your eyes that are broken.

65
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,918
Please don't imagine
that I won't use this minute to do it,

66
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,637
or that I am afraid of your prayers
OF your Crosses.

67
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,632
You see the world broken.

68
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,400
Like those beaten children will.

69
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,238
Now look at me.

70
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,634
Look at me.

71
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,754
Look at me!

72
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,393
Funding withdrawn.

73
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,074
All children to be taken
into our own institutions.

74
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,635
You have no say in where the children...

75
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,159
If I come for you,

76
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,079
and I still might yet decide
to come for you,

77
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,591
I will wear high heels
so you can hear my approach

78
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,270
on the cobblestones,
and have time to repent.

79
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,231
You listen for my footsteps.

80
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,474
Happy birthday, Pol.

81
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,716
They grow grand in the horse shit, Pol.

82
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,513
Curly, pour some beer, eh?

83
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,193
The train to London leaves in an hour.

84
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,153
Arthur, Michael, you're coming with me.

85
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,352
Tommy, I have to take Gina
to the hospital today.

86
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,959
A week ago,

87
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,994
one of our most trusted men
was killed by Jimmy McCavern.

88
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,509
The man we're gonna speak to in London

89
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,677
is establishing a relationship
with Jimmy McCavern.

90
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,634
So cancel your appointments,
and Ada can take Gina to the hospital.

91
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,239
That's what women do.

92
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,991
And clean that shit off your shoes
before you get in my car, eh?

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,072
Michael, they will give it and give it
until your case is proven,

94
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,599
and then they'll take it.

95
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,075
From you, but mainly from me.

96
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,398
Polly, you go to the hospital
and speak to Aberama Gold.

97
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,037
You tell him there is a strategy in place
to avenge the death of his son,

98
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,514
so not to do anything rash.

99
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,597
And take with you
the heartfelt condolences

100
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,994
of the whole family.

101
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,440
Why me?

102
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,400
Because Aberama Gold is in love with you.
He even got a haircut.

103
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,638
And the smell of your perfume
might help ease his pain.

104
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,195
Tommy, I'm 45 years old today.

105
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,233
45 years old
and still breaking hearts, eh?

106
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,509
- Yeah!
- To Polly!

107
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,517
Polly Gray, hmm?

108
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,550
Polly.

109
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,398
Happy Birthday, Pol, yeah?

110
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,115
Curly, organise a wagon to take
Bonnie Gold's soul to heaven.

111
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,076
Isiah, fetch his boxing gloves
from the gym to burn with his body.

112
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,353
Michael, turn the Bentley around,
you've a train to catch.

113
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,477
And don't forget
to wipe that shit off your shoes, eh?

114
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,675
Just start up the car and drive.

115
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,110
So, what's the strategy?

116
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,469
You can smile.

117
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,114
You...don't smile.

118
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,715
Nice.

119
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,315
Very nice, Tom.

120
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,751
Although, I must say, I thought
your office would be bigger than this.

121
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,075
It will be.

122
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,838
Michael, you sit.

123
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,519
Arthur, you stand by the window.

124
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,958
So, who are we meeting?

125
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,230
The man we're about to meet

126
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,237
is the Minister
for the Duchy of Lancaster.

127
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,910
He's also deputy
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer

128
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,398
and Cabinet adviser
to the Prime Minister of Great Britain.

129
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,790
You've both met bad men before.

130
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,790
The man we're about to meet is the devil.

131
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,270
Yep.

132
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,879
Send him in.

133
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,155
I never seem to get to meet you
without your family.

134
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,114
I understand you know a man
called Jimmy McCavern.

135
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,878
May I take a cigarette?

136
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,434
Please.

137
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,958
Who on earth is Jimmy McCavern?

138
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,873
Over the last 12 months,

139
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,992
you've been making approaches
to various men across the country

140
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,240
who you think might be able
to help you in your cause.

141
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,351
McCavern is one of these men.

142
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,394
He runs the east Glasgow shipyards.
He killed an associate of mine.

143
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,273
I want to know what your strategy is.

144
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,430
That one's your brother, yes?

145
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,472
Yes, and I'm his business adviser.

146
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,877
We would like to talk business.

147
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,155
Michael.

148
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,470
Michael Gray.

149
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,360
You lost all your cousin"s money
in America playing the fool.

150
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,150
A nightclub in Detroit
called the Gladiator was your regular.

151
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,475
You lost the money...

152
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,079
...and found a wife there.

153
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,116
And poor old Arthur Shelby standing
there at the window

154
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,675
is afraid his wife will never return.

155
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,075
My spies tell me
she's been seen with another man.

156
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,599
Arthur...

157
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,040
Arthur.

158
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,515
And bingo.

159
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,191
20 seconds in, and I have them
speaking their wog lingo.

160
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,231
Mr Shelby, I do have plans.

161
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,591
I will have need of men like you.

162
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,873
Except, of course,
there is no other man like you.

163
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,760
You, in particular, I need.

164
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,119
But, please,

165
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,517
don't imagine I would trouble myself
with turf wars.

166
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,994
You have many enemies.

167
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,953
Shuffle the pack and pick another card.

168
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,995
That investigation of the dead journalist,

169
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,394
the queer...

170
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,591
I've made that go away.

171
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,758
Read it and, uh, come back to me.

172
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,431
Next time, bring only an open mind
and a cigar to celebrate our union.

173
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,077
What the fuck was that all about, Tom?

174
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,150
Fuck.

175
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,600
Fuck.

176
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,437
Arthur!

177
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,554
Do not let them get inside your head.

178
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,071
That's exactly how these people work.

179
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,511
Who the fuck are these people, hmm?

180
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,199
Who the fuck are they?!

181
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,869
I've just been invited...

182
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,358
...to become the deputy leader
of a brand-new political party.

183
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,192
These people say they are the future.

184
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,711
Do you want a drink?

185
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,160
I've stopped.

186
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,317
So, what have you decided?

187
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,716
I've been talking to the Friends.

188
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,830
- What friends?
- Quakers.

189
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,839
Friends who meet at the meeting house
in Bournville.

190
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,678
I'm staying in Bournville.

191
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,792
And what do they say?

192
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,560
They say I've been led astray.

193
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,634
If you've come to talk about redemption,
you're talking to the wrong person.

194
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,478
I also went to a solicitor.

195
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,674
They heard my name was Shelby,
and suddenly they were too busy.

196
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,794
To divorce a Shelby man,
you have to go to a solicitor in London.

197
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,959
I found one.

198
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,514
He said he'd represent me.

199
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,950
But I put the phone down.

200
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,274
Not through fear.

201
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,476
I chose this life, it didn't choose me.

202
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,989
Also, Lizzie, one of the Friends is a man.

203
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,032
He listens to me when I talk.

204
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,351
His wife died of the Spanish flu.

205
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,073
He has a daughter.

206
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,318
And you're considering making
this daughter an orphan?

207
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,999
Nothing has happened.

208
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,190
Nor will it.

209
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,719
He would die without his eyes.

210
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,396
And out of kindness,
Tommy would offer his daughter

211
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,160
a place in one of his institutions
for orphaned girls.

212
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,237
Or even take her into the family.

213
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,874
And it would begin again.

214
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,753
What is the thing, Linda?

215
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,399
The thing you can't put aside?

216
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,238
It's not Arthur.

217
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,031
It's who I am when he's there.

218
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,872
God hears every filthy word in my head,

219
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,116
knows every dirty thing.

220
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,277
And your Friends don't use filthy words?

221
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,472
If I fall this time,
I'll fall all the way.

222
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,389
Perhaps it's what you deserve,
with your filthy words.

223
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,438
I used to fuck seven men a day,

224
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,949
and now I'm learning
how to ride a horse side-saddle.

225
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,437
There's good and there's evil.

226
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,437
There's both mixed.

227
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,955
And that's Arthur and you...and me?

228
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,357
You don't get what you deserve,
you get what you take.

229
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,237
What about him?

230
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,951
He's making up his mind.

231
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,149
Someone called Polly Gray to see you.

232
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,992
Yes or no?

233
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,440
Yes.

234
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,951
I've come to take you to the clinic.

235
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,549
I already told Michael -
my husband or no-one.

236
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,398
I've got a car.

237
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,273
They have taxis,
even in this fucking city.

238
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,677
Look, if they don't hear a heartbeat,
they're gonna give you options.

239
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,393
None of them are nice.

240
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,477
I had my check-up three days ago.

241
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,318
They heard a beating heart.

242
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,319
But if they had told me
that baby had died inside of me,

243
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,511
I would have wanted someone with me.

244
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,999
My husband may do as he's told,

245
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,191
but, er, I don't.

246
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,392
Look, if they hear a heartbeat,
you won't need anybody with you,

247
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,193
cos you'll have the baby with you.

248
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,038
So I will leave you alone.

249
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,596
But if you get in a taxi in this city
and they hear your accent,

250
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,711
they'll take you on a grand tour.

251
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,795
Come on.

252
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,989
- So, when will Mum be home?
- She said she had to go to Birmingham.

253
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,714
- Do you want me to cook you something?
- Cook?

254
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,433
You're a man.

255
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,953
This is really not fair.

256
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,356
Your mother never told me
you were this good.

257
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,676
I'm in a club. I'm the champion.

258
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,711
I beat people even older than you.

259
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,275
Even older than me?

260
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,357
At school, some of the children
say that black people and Jews are worse.

261
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,312
Worse than what?

262
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,477
Than anything.

263
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,318
And one teacher,

264
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,919
Mr Hudson,

265
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,554
he calls my friend a little Jew boy.

266
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,591
Karl, these days,
there are some very stupid people

267
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,394
saying some very stupid things.

268
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,272
OK?

269
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,635
What do you think?

270
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,110
Checkmate.

271
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,749
I think I don't want you to be my dad.

272
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,838
Cos my dad's white...and he's in heaven.

273
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,434
I came to see you in hospital
to tell you there's a strategy in place,

274
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,073
not to break you out.

275
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,273
Don't worry,
my sister will look after me.

276
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,191
You must stay here,

277
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,756
and you'll let Tommy deal
with the men who killed your son.

278
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,278
You're 45 today.

279
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,437
I'm probably a bit older than that.

280
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,080
Probably.

281
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,589
I've dealt death.

282
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,829
Now death has dealt with me.

283
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,480
I have one more killing to do
then I'll be done.

284
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,116
Happy birthday, Polly Gray.

285
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,079
Get a car and a driver.

286
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,238
Find out where the Fury family are camped.

287
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,636
I need their men to help me.

288
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,355
I'll need my hunting rifle, 50 bullets.

289
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,517
I'm going to Scotland.

290
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,710
Tonight.

291
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,554
I was expecting Ada.

292
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,751
Yeah. Give you a key, did she?

293
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,235
I was meant to meet her today,
but she said had to go to Birmingham.

294
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,794
Yes. Tommy sent her on a mission.

295
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,274
She's doing my job for me.

296
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,515
Where's Karl, eh? Where's the boy?

297
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,438
He went to buy an ice cream.

298
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,358
Ada said to tell you she'd be late.

299
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,393
- You knew I'd be here?
- Yeah, we knew you'd be here.

300
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,272
We have some business for you.

301
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,313
Any business I have with you, Mr Shelby,
is meant to be strictly confidential.

302
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,953
Ah, Michael.
You still have shit on your shoes.

303
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,037
My associate here can evidently smell it.

304
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,275
I don't mean any of fence.

305
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,869
Here, Michael, go and find Karl

306
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,435
and buy him an ice cream, eh?

307
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,880
The man doesn't trust you.

308
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,912
Fuck you, Tom.

309
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,069
You know Gina phoned.

310
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,997
The baby's heart's beating strong.

311
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,952
And I swear to God, Tom,

312
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,959
by the time
that baby draws its first breath,

313
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,115
you and I will be done.

314
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,751
And you will be king.

315
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,109
Is that it, Michael?

316
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,799
You know, Tom,

317
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,752
there are doctors in London now

318
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,077
who can talk their way into your head,
dig out all the shit.

319
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,434
Perhaps, you should see one.

320
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,994
You're still not alone.

321
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,553
Me brother and I are the same person.

322
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,670
Here.

323
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,438
Here's a letter from Mosley.

324
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,597
You should read it.

325
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,709
What investigation is he talking about?

326
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,915
Two weeks ago,
a journalist was killed in Maida Vale.

327
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,078
The night before,
he'd come to me about some story

328
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,191
he was going to write about me.

329
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,913
We had nothing to do with that killing.

330
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,997
Mosley wants you as his deputy?

331
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,398
His constituency is Smethwick.

332
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,510
It borders my own.

333
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,153
He wants Birmingham as his stronghold.

334
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,636
He knows I've...strong support
among working people.

335
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,596
We help him out at rallies,
show up at some town hall meetings.

336
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,838
Right, and why are you showing
this letter to me?

337
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,359
A Minister of State

338
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,074
who may have seditious intentions.

339
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,191
There's no proof of sedition
in this letter.

340
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,879
You work in intelligence, Younger.

341
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,196
You don't need proof.
Give it to your superiors.

342
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,472
Mr Shelby, I have a very specific brief.

343
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,719
My brief is specifically
to gather information

344
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,751
on the activities of communists.

345
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,557
Your immediate superior
in the intelligence unit

346
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,399
is a Colonel Patrick Wyatt, yeah?

347
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,356
I understand he regularly plays polo
with Oswald Mosley.

348
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,678
They share membership of various clubs
in London and Birmingham.

349
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,029
I have specific orders.

350
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,480
I am a soldier.

351
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,399
You think you can join this family?

352
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,559
I have no intention of joining a family.

353
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,275
Well, thank fuck for that,
cos, er, you'd hate our weddings.

354
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,074
Thought you said this was about business.

355
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,998
Yes - family business
and government business,

356
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,474
all in one envelope.

357
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,469
Younger, listen to me.

358
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,238
Forget about Ada.

359
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,953
Forget about weddings.

360
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,793
You know what Mosley represents.

361
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,957
You know his philosophy.

362
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,389
I am planning to reply to him
and tell him that I'm making up my mind.

363
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,876
But in the meantime,
you need to give me instruction.

364
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,832
I could fight him on my own, if I have to,

365
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,157
or I could join his organisation

366
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,160
and undermine him on behalf of the King.

367
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,715
But you need to make a decision.

368
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,909
I suppose there are a few things
I can do on my own initiative.

369
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,594
On your fucking feet.

370
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,189
Hello, Tom.

371
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,879
I thought you were staying over in London.

372
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,311
Hello, Johnny.

373
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,239
How are you, eh?

374
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,749
How are your ribs?

375
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,757
You managing?

376
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,632
- Just about Tom, yeah.
- Yeah? Good.

377
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,797
And who's that?

378
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,790
Is it Maisie, or is it Clara?

379
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,118
Ah! Sandra.

380
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,038
Well, may I say,

381
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,791
your breakfasts are a great improvement.

382
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,958
Mr Shelby, I'm sorry.

383
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,479
Don't worry, Sandra.

384
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,352
The only way to get fired
from this household

385
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,790
is through burnt toast...

386
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,672
...or talking to the police.

387
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,995
Go on, go to bed.

388
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,990
And Sandra...

389
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,912
...everything Johnny said is lies.

390
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,111
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny...

391
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,437
While you was gone, I got a message, Tom.

392
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,235
A cousin of Aberama Gold
galloped from Meriden.

393
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,318
He said Aberama wants you to know
that he's gone to Scotland

394
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,477
to deal with his business himself,

395
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,238
and that you'd know what that meant.

396
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,998
Fuck!

397
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,990
The boy said Aberama arrived
from the hospital in Polly's Bentley.

398
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,039
She fucking helped him.

399
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,353
She fucking helped him.

400
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,712
But it can't be love, cos it's Polly.

401
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,433
Cos it's fucking Polly.

402
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,550
All right, Johnny,
I have a job for you.

403
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,875
Tom, I'm in a lot of pain here.

404
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,594
I need you to go and find Aberama Gold.

405
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,553
He has kin on the Lothian border,
the Fury family.

406
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,954
Ah, for fuck's sake, Tom!

407
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,357
The Furys, they don't even use words
to fucking talk.

408
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,312
Just hand gestures and fucking howls.

409
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,431
You will go to them
and you will find him.

410
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,278
Tom, I am in fucking pain here.

411
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,358
- Yeah, you appear to be managing.
- I said I was just managing.

412
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,915
Well, you can just manage
to sit in a car with Arthur

413
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,475
and follow the patrin
to find the Fury family.

414
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,638
Arthur will take care of everything
that requires bones and muscles.

415
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,559
I warned you, Tom.
The Golds will be the death of one of us.

416
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,112
And it looks like it's gonna be
fucking me!

417
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,233
Well, go on, open it.

418
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,955
So...

419
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,717
...you heard the baby's heartbeat today.

420
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,078
Beats so fast.

421
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,556
Would have been a birthday gift enough.

422
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,398
A new life.

423
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,440
Liberty.

424
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,951
Freedom.

425
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,279
Feels like a weapon.

426
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,960
I only came because Michael's
driving back from London

427
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,196
and he said he didn't want you
to be on your own.

428
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,430
So...

429
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,992
Whose idea was the gift of freedom?

430
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,269
Mine.

431
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,598
You want to take Michael
and the baby to New York?

432
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,949
Yes.

433
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,718
The baby will have two grandmothers.

434
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,875
The other one lives...

435
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,435
The other one lives amongst human beings.

436
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,359
The other one ls a human being.

437
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,390
It's all right, I'm not drunk.

438
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,477
I'm just free.

439
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,079
So, what do you want?

440
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,713
My approval?

441
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,029
Your help.

442
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,358
Michael wants you to come with us.

443
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,233
We can all live in Long Island,
right on the beach.

444
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,231
Isn't Long Island in Australia?

445
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,231
Or is it in California,
amongst the Indians?

446
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,829
It's in New York, Polly.

447
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,151
You see, we all try and get away.

448
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,870
But we never do.

449
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,190
I wish I felt that heartbeat today.

450
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,953
You're starting to sound
a little sorry for yourself.

451
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,156
I'm an American.

452
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,716
We don't just go round
and round and round.

453
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,955
We go in a straight line.

454
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,559
And my baby...will be born in New York.

455
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,354
I'm not happy about moving this meeting
to licensed premises.

456
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:33,350
You've saved your union the train fare,
and you hate London anyway.

457
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,711
We're looking for popular speakers
for our upcoming rally.

458
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,912
You're making quite a name for yourself
in the Commons.

459
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,633
Betty!

460
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,239
What are you drinking?

461
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,509
Water.

462
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,551
Bottle of Champagne, Betty.

463
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,717
You'll drink it on your own.

464
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,955
That's the idea.

465
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,878
Shall we sit down, Miss Eden?

466
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,673
Revolution.

467
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,516
So, how is life as a socialist?

468
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,560
This glass.

469
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,115
The bubbles.

470
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,838
They rise to the top.

471
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,318
Each bubble has the same chance to rise.

472
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,319
That is a very peculiar form of socialism.

473
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,475
And this bottle.

474
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,393
Once the cork comes out...

475
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,634
...you can't get it back in.

476
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,637
You need to finish what you started.

477
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,550
It's cleverness, that's all.

478
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,231
So you're playing at this.

479
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,510
People can be turned around.

480
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,230
Even your people.

481
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,795
- My people?
- Yeah.

482
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,957
For them, it's just the same.

483
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,913
Communism. Fascism.

484
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,032
For most people,
it's an apple and an apple.

485
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,197
Fascism is the subject of the rally.

486
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,039
I want you to speak against it.

487
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,912
In answer to your question...

488
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,037
...] cannot address your rally...

489
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,790
...because it's not part
of the current strategy.

490
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,951
Are you OK, Thomas?

491
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,959
Do you want a man to carry you home?

492
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,912
I knew we should not have had this meeting
on licensed premises.

493
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,918
Happy or sad, Thomas?

494
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,871
I warn you, I'll break your heart.

495
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,072
I didn't expect you home.

496
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,312
Frances said Linda was here today.

497
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,910
Frances has a very specific loyalty,
doesn't she?

498
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,996
Well, people are loyal
to those who pay their wages.

499
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:54,038
Also, Maggie at the exchange
said you made some calls.

500
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,197
Then you'll know I called a solicitor.

501
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,390
Did Maggie listen in to the conversation?

502
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,879
He said he'd represent me.

503
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,878
But I put the phone down.

504
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,630
There and then, I made a decision.

505
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,759
And when I heard your car pull up,
I got changed.

506
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,075
You said, in your head,
you still pay for it.

507
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,030
So I've decided to continue
to take the payment

508
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,878
and balance my heart against my head,

509
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,230
as though it were a book of accounts.

510
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,115
- I value my head a shilling more.
- Huh!

511
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:47,719
When was the last time
you had to worry about shillings, eh?

512
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,555
People are loyal to those
who pay their wages.

513
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,512
That's why I'll be loyal to you.

514
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,399
But this is the deal.

515
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,717
You don't fuck anybody else in my house,

516
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,877
nor within a day
of holding our child by the hand.

517
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,559
A day on either side.

518
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,678
And you let me in sometimes.

519
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,915
Into your head.

520
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,034
To clear it out.

521
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,390
That what needs clearing out.

522
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,994
Agreed.

523
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,434
And this...

524
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,597
Always.

525
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,756
The deal is...

526
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,109
...you belong to me.

527
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,670
My property.

528
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,231
No-one touches my property.

529
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,150
I touch myself, but it's still you anyway.

530
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,794
So that's why I put the phone down.

531
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,674
No, Tom.

532
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,871
We do it in the bed at least.

533
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,552
Everything is mine, Lizzie.

534
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,069
Everything.

535
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,951
Arthur.

536
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,640
Frances was right.

537
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,319
Linda was here today.

538
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,113
Fuck.

539
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,072
What did she say, huh?

540
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,676
- I just want to talk to her, that's all.
- Arthur, listen.

541
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,155
First I need you to go to Scotland

542
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,953
and bring back Aberama Gold.

543
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,514
Then we'll go and we'll find Linda.

544
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,916
No, no, no, no.

545
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,519
I'll keep calling you, Tom.

546
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,080
You know I will.

547
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,278
I'll call this number back...

548
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,518
...again, again and again.

549
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,790
If you don't answer,

550
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,240
I'll jump in my fucking car

551
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,591
and I'll drive to your house,
you know I will.

552
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,919
I'll stay there all night if I have to.

553
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,713
I won't go nowhere -

554
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,478
not Scotland -

555
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,194
till you tell me what it is you know.

556
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,390
Right, listen to me.

557
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,193
I don't have an address.

558
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,840
But she's with the Quakers in Bournville.

559
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,231
Apparently,
there is someone who is a Friend.

560
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,996
He had a wife who died
from Spanish flu in 1918.

561
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,633
And he has a daughter.

562
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,592
That should be enough to find him.

563
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,279
Arthur...

564
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,631
Just talk to him
and get a message to Linda.

565
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,360
Nothing happened, Arthur.

566
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,357
He's a Quaker, a Friend.

567
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,040
They're not like us, they talk.

568
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,559
Oh, I'll speak to him.

569
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,355
Man to man.

570
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,629
And then, after that...

571
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,592
...I go up north, hmm.

572
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,313
Deal with our business.

573
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,397
I promise you.

574
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,591
Arthur. Arthur, listen to me...

575
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,955
Who were you talking to?

576
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,277
I have to ask you,
cos Maggie at the exchange won't tell me.

577
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,471
Who was it?

578
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,795
Was it Arthur?

579
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,631
I need my brother in one piece.

580
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,990
Arthur makes his own decisions.

581
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,231
You marry a Shelby,

582
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,237
you stay fucking married.

583
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,279
Fuck.

584
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,073
Well, look at this, hmm.

585
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,554
Can I help you?

586
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,956
Yeah, I think you can.

587
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,879
I'm looking for Linda Shelby.

588
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,149
Do you know her?

589
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,032
Eh? I'm Arthur.

590
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,435
Her husband.

591
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,672
If you're her husband,
she doesn't want to talk to you.

592
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,030
Well, look at you.

593
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,357
Ain't you smart?

594
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,478
What, you got all the fucking answers,
have you?

595
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,160
Well, let's try you with another one. Eh?

596
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,395
Let's try you with another one.

597
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,669
How about...

598
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,715
How about we search
for the fucking truth within, hmm?

599
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,877
Let's have a look, eh? Let's have a look.

600
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,593
See what we've got inside here, eh?

601
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,757
You fucking bastard!

602
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,157
Eh? You wanna keep looking, eh?

603
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,033
Hey,

604
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,993
I wanna ask you again.

605
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,636
I'll ask you again.

606
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,753
Where is she? Eh?

607
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,518
Where is she?

608
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,475
No. No, no, no...

609
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,993
I'm a good man.

610
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,520
I'm a fucking good man, like you.

611
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,034
A God-fearing man.

612
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,512
There is good in my heart.

613
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,074
There is good in my heart!

614
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,675
But my hands...

615
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,189
These hands belong to the devil.

616
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,951
The fucking devil!

617
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,991
Wait... Who are you?

618
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,950
Did she come back?

619
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,635
No.

620
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,477
Is she in Scotland?
Is that why you're going?

621
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,876
No, she's not in fucking Scotland,
Charlie.

622
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,955
Whiskey.

623
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,275
We want whiskey.

624
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,310
Maps.

625
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,794
Cigars.

626
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,399
Load the van, we want it all.

627
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,749
Who's we?

628
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,279
Me and Johnny Dogs.

629
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,920
So it's you and Johnny Dogs
against Scotland?

630
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,117
You know, at the BSA,
our friends could get you

631
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,790
some of them new artillery cannons
that fire ten shells a second.

632
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,912
You can mount one
on the roof of your fucking car.

633
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,678
Petrol.

634
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,756
We need petrol.

635
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,111
It's so far up north,
they run out of the bloody stuff.

636
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,475
Yeah.

637
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,831
Still riding round on fucking chariots,
they are.

638
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,636
Curly, Arthur is going to Scotland,
so he needs hand grenades.

639
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,830
How many?

640
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,871
Fuck's sake, it's like it's normal.

641
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,799
Our friends at the BSA
still have lots left from the war,

642
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,831
but we can't give them...

643
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,600
Get me some hand grenades, Curly, eh?
Hmm?

644
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,633
You find 'em back there, eh?
Good boy, yeah?

645
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,070
You get me some.
Put them on my account.

646
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,474
Yeah.

647
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,319
How many?

648
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,556
- Three, Curly.
- Three. Three.

649
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,071
Find a way of getting her back, Arthur.

650
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,236
Without her,
you're as good as dead already.

651
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,994
That's them, the Billy Boys!

652
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,231
Gentlemen.

653
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:45,150
You have just crossed the border
into the County of East Tollcross.

654
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,909
Now, according
to the unwritten constitution

655
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,678
of Tollcross County,

656
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:57,113
Gypsies, Catholics
and other criminally minded individuals

657
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,631
are not allowed to work the roads
of our Protestant district

658
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,195
on account of the poor quality
of their labour.

659
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,154
So, my own boys
will be taking over from here.

660
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,557
We will be needing your tools,

661
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,559
your tar, your burner...

662
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,593
...and your transportation.

663
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,074
You're Gypsies,

664
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,714
you can easily steal another.

665
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,037
I have the keys to the truck.

666
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,759
Now...

667
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:23,358
...I want you boys to take a message back
to Jimmy McCavern.

668
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,118
You killed my son.

669
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,878
You hoisted him on a cross!

670
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,034
Now, in this gun...

671
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,512
...there's a bullet

672
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,190
and on it is carved the name McCavern.

673
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,238
And when the time comes
for his crucifixion,

674
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:50,877
it will be me who drives in the nails.

675
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,157
Mr Shelby!

676
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,237
At last you are alone.

677
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,392
I think we'll make quite the team.

678
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,591
The pheasants won't know what hit them.

679
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,478
You're a fine shot, Mr Shelby.

680
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,519
You were in the yeomanry, yes?

681
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,518
Were you cavalry?

682
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,439
You won the Distinguished Service Medal.

683
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,595
That'll help.

684
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,870
With what?

685
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,755
Two months ago, I was in Rome.

686
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,200
I met Mr Mussolini.

687
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,993
You and I and men like him...

688
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,033
...we will shape the future.

689
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,391
When will you resign
from the Labour Party?

690
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:28,039
The day before I announce
the formation of my new party.

691
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,875
The British Union of Fascists will be born
on January 1st of next year.

692
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,479
The first day of a new decade.

693
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,277
The 1930s, Mr Shelby, will belong to us.

694
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,554
Did you bring that cigar?

695
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,150
Before we smoke...

696
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,754
...]I have some conditions.

697
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,509
It really isn't going to be
that kind of relationship.

698
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,109
Just smoke like the fine man
you will become.

699
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,871
Yes, Colonel Ben Younger.

700
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,913
I have an allocated confidential line -
code 78.

701
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,277
It's me.

702
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,277
I've agreed to work with our friend.

703
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,029
He's gonna announce on January 1st.

704
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,152
I need to know that my position
as informant against him

705
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,509
is officially sanctioned.

706
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,590
Today, gentlemen,

707
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,270
we are avenging an unprovoked attack

708
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,710
on members of our organisation

709
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,799
who were simply carrying out
a routine border patrol.

710
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,230
Our enemies are Gypsies,

711
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:10,070
members of a race destined
for natural eradication anyway,

712
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,397
due to what the scientists call selection.

713
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,959
And since these beggars
are unchristened and unregistered,

714
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,435
the local constabulary
will as soon drop them

715
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:25,440
in a communal grave
as find a name for a gravestone.

716
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:32,160
So proceed in any manner you choose
to find the fugitive we seek.

717
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,358
Morning, Mr Gold.

718
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,278
Yeah.

719
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,311
The Billy Boys are coming for you.

720
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,078
How the fuck did you find me?

721
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,191
Give you no choice, eh?

722
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,470
What, hmm? What?

723
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,316
And a Bentley outside, the engine running.

724
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,795
Fastest engine in the world,
apparently, which is good.

725
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,753
We've got two minutes to get out of here.

726
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,319
We are officers of
the East Lanarkshire Special Constabulary.

727
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,910
We are seeking a man
by the name of Aberama Gold.

728
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,754
Hand the gentleman over,
and no-one else will be harmed.

729
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,794
Fuck! Take cover!

730
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,992
So, Tommy Shelby...

731
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,354
...it's war you want...

732
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,117
...it's war you shall have.
