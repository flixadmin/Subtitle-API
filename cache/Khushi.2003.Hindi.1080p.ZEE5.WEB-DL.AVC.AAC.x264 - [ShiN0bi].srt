1
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:20,692
KHUSHI

2
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:33,465
It'll be all right.

3
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:22,594
Welcome sir Has the
midwife arrived Sitaram.

4
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:26,937
Greetings.

5
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,950
Don't be afraid it'll all be
okay in a little while.

6
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:36,218
Don't be afraid be brave.
Give me that towel.

7
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:41,018
Give me some water.

8
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:51,583
Congratulations.
God has given you a baby girl.

9
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:54,243
- Praise the Lord!
- Come on in, sir.

10
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:24,226
She's so lovable.

11
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:30,752
Well? My whiskers prick?

12
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:46,626
This is the world in which every man
lives for just one reason.

13
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,690
That they find love in
everyone's heart.

14
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:53,978
Love manifests itself in many ways.
Between mother and son,

15
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:56,538
between brothers
and sisters, friends,

16
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:59,740
but there's a love far removed
from all these kinds of love...

17
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:04,705
A love that is born in young hearts.
A love that brings joy to the heart

18
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:15,419
Born in the eastern part
of India, in Kolkata...

19
00:04:16,068 --> 00:04:17,978
is Karan.

20
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:28,153
Born in Chamoli village of
Uttaranchal state...

21
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:31,810
is Virbhadra's daughter, Khushi.

22
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:38,531
Theirs is a marriage
God decided in His heavens.

23
00:04:40,068 --> 00:04:43,898
Despite being born in
different castes and regions...

24
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:36,282
They have one thing in common...

25
00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:48,865
Love.

26
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:54,467
These are the two children who
are going to fall in love.

27
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:58,299
When will they fall in love?
When will they unite?

28
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:00,698
That's what this story is all about.

29
00:05:01,188 --> 00:05:06,939
Despite the distance between them,
when will these two young hearts...

30
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:09,338
get to know each other
and accept each other?

31
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's witness the miracle
of nature.

32
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:25,185
This is the biggest sari-store
in Mumbai.

33
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:27,643
You'll find every kind of sari here.

34
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:30,370
- What do you think of this one?
- Nice

35
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,938
That yellow one. Show me that.

36
00:07:06,013 --> 00:07:09,787
Why's she so late? She should
have been here by now.

37
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:13,618
- Who? Ram Singh?
- No. Lali!

38
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:17,458
You start ranting the moment
your daughter's a bit late.

39
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:21,625
Mind your own business.
And don't say I'm ranting.

40
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:27,480
Here comes Lali!
Lali...

41
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:32,499
- Ram Singh, hasn't Lali come?
- No

42
00:07:32,861 --> 00:07:35,000
Moron! You must have
missed her in the crowds.

43
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:39,539
What crowds, sir? There's just a
single railway line and a hut.

44
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:43,064
If anyone ever gets off the train,
it's only to have some water.

45
00:07:43,484 --> 00:07:46,266
- So what crowds will there be?
- Strange

46
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:49,463
She told me that she'd be coming.

47
00:07:51,164 --> 00:07:52,986
What could have happened?

48
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:11,218

Lali! My child!

90
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:13,875
Welcome, sir. Greetings.

91
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:16,978
Madam Lali says they're here
in the village to help us.

92
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:19,545
I've made all the arrangements
they wanted.

93
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:21,780
- Where is my daughter donating blood?
- Over there.

94
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:22,930
Moron!

95
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:36,505
Bloody doctor! How dare you
draw blood from my daughter?

96
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:40,981
How dare you?
Put that blood back in her! Go on!

97
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:45,399
Hurry! Get that syringe out
which is drawing her blood.

98
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:48,022
- Listen to me...
- Use a syringe to put in the blood.

99
00:14:48,477 --> 00:14:52,950
- How dare you draw blood from her?
- Donating blood isn't a bad thing.

100
00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:55,643
- Blood is blood! It isn't water.
- Come on, Papa.

123
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,628
- Don't pray like this for me.
- Why're you angry with your mother?

124
00:20:02,045 --> 00:20:04,914
Ma's asking for just the opposite
of what I'm asking of God.

125
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:08,021
God must himself be confused.
Will He heed my prayers or Ma's?

126
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:11,378
What you've prayed for and
what your Ma prayed for?

127
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:15,058
I prayed so I can go away to Canada
and she prays that I don't go away.

128
00:20:15,453 --> 00:20:17,558
It isn't just a prayer,
she's been meditating.

129
00:20:17,948 --> 00:20:19,858
- Dad, do you mind?
- Not at all.

130
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:22,484
If my son studies in Canada,
what would be better than that?

131
00:20:22,748 --> 00:20:25,301
- How true!
- If it was only for 5 months...

132
00:20:25,628 --> 00:20:27,865
I wouldn't have said anything,
but 5 years?

133
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:31,384
Just 5 years, Ma!
They'll pass in a jiffy.

134
00:20:32,925 --> 00:20:34,834
What haven't I done to
get an admission?

135
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:39,058
I ran around for the passport
and visa.

136
00:20:41,084 --> 00:20:44,499
When I can stay away for 5 years,
can't you do it too, Ma?

137
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:48,276
- She's always crying, daddy!
- Obviously, my son. She's your mother.

138
00:20:56,637 --> 00:20:59,506
- What? You want to study further?
- Yes.

139
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:00,697
Oh no.

140
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,836
We have very few educated boys
in our community anyway.

141
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:07,283
And you want to study further?
Where will I find a suitor for you?

142
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:11,508
- A suitor...? What for?
- To play Cricket with you

143
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:15,353
Why're you talking about
marriage right now, Papa?

144
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:18,872
I want to complete my MSc.
I've filled in the application form.

145
00:21:19,388 --> 00:21:20,730
Sign it.

146
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,225
Sign it, Papa.

147
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:25,524
I'll pull you by your plaits!

148
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,533
Who do you think you are?

149
00:21:29,436 --> 00:21:32,819
You're always doing as you wish.

150
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,618
There are just four boys
who've done BSc...

151
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:39,698
in our village and the
neighbouring villages.

152
00:21:40,093 --> 00:21:42,003
Two of them belong
to our community.

153
00:21:42,428 --> 00:21:46,258
One of them is leaving for America.
What for, God alone knows.

154
00:21:47,293 --> 00:21:50,424
That leaves Ranvir Chaudhary's son.

155
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:55,604
I've begged him and got him to agree
to live with us after your marriage.

156
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:58,901
I've called them over tomorrow
for your engagement.

157
00:21:59,229 --> 00:22:01,138
Called them over?
With whose permission?

158
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:03,378
- Whose permission do I need to take?
- I don't want all this.

159
00:22:03,548 --> 00:22:04,825
I want to study.

160
00:22:15,516 --> 00:22:18,899
My child, listen to me.

161
00:22:20,828 --> 00:22:24,985
After 10 years of prayers,
God blessed us with a child.

162
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:30,807
A baby-girl. If I get you
married in another town...

163
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:34,647
I'll keep thinking
and worrying about you.

164
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,182
Tell me, will I be able to live
if you're far away from me?

165
00:22:40,988 --> 00:22:43,858
- Who's marrying and going far away?
- If you study any further...

166
00:22:44,093 --> 00:22:47,508
that's just what is going to happen!
So I've called them for an engagement.

167
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:51,218
So ask them not to come. I want to
study further. Please sign this.

168
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,658
You tore up my application form?

169
00:23:05,373 --> 00:23:07,478
That's chap coming to meet
me tomorrow, isn't he?

170
00:23:07,868 --> 00:23:10,257
Just you see!
I'll drive him away!

171
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,280
Just you watch!

172
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:26,294
- Come to bed.
- I'm not sleepy. You go on.

173
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:30,108
- It's 2 in the morning. Come...
- I'm not sleepy. You go to sleep!

174
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:21,530
Lord Hanuman...

175
00:24:21,788 --> 00:24:25,137
please make my daughter
agree to the wedding...

176
00:24:25,628 --> 00:24:27,800
please make my daughter
agree to the wedding...

177
00:24:35,965 --> 00:24:40,024
- God has heard your prayers.
- What? Really?

178
00:24:40,988 --> 00:24:43,607
You may call them over.
I agree to the wedding.

179
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:47,698
Praise You, Lord Hanuman!

180
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:54,963
This is my daughter, Khushi.
I call her Lali lovingly.

181
00:24:55,388 --> 00:25:00,538
After the marriage, you can
call her either Khushi or Lali

182
00:25:01,148 --> 00:25:04,661
You can even give her a new name.
It's your choice.

183
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:29,938
Do you like the boy?

184
00:25:30,204 --> 00:25:33,139
I'm so happy that you've
agreed to the wedding.

185
00:25:33,597 --> 00:25:39,226
But if you don't like the boy,
tell me. I'll find other boys.

186
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:42,803
Now tell me...
do you approve of this chap?

187
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:48,723
That's chap coming to meet
me tomorrow, isn't he?

188
00:25:48,892 --> 00:25:51,064
Just you see!
I'll drive him away!

189
00:25:51,389 --> 00:25:52,883
Just you watch!

190
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,170
Wow! So you approve of him!

191
00:26:00,701 --> 00:26:03,156
The wedding of Virbhadra Singh's
daughter Khushi...

192
00:26:03,357 --> 00:26:06,586
has been fixed with Ranvir Singh's
son Mahendra.

193
00:26:17,436 --> 00:26:18,713
My glasses...

194
00:26:18,908 --> 00:26:23,698
- I haven't done anything.
- So who is it?

195
00:26:31,165 --> 00:26:33,107
I'm flying to Canada?

196
00:26:35,932 --> 00:26:38,616
- Why're you laughing?
- I'm the one who's going.

197
00:26:39,357 --> 00:26:42,324
- You?
- My passport’s okay, my visa's okay

198
00:26:44,668 --> 00:26:47,057
Go away to Canada.
I'm going to rot here.

199
00:26:56,509 --> 00:26:58,898
God... how could this happen?

200
00:26:59,293 --> 00:27:02,871
Why're you crying?
What happened, Ma?

201
00:27:03,645 --> 00:27:04,855
I don't know...

202
00:27:04,988 --> 00:27:08,185
the groom's sister was crying
after she read this letter.

203
00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:12,658
Dear Khushi, forgive me.
I'm in love with someone.

204
00:27:13,116 --> 00:27:15,538
Had I told my father,
he'd have killed me.

205
00:27:15,837 --> 00:27:19,383
I know, it's terrible to tell
the girl a day before the wedding...

206
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,585
What happened, Lali?
What happened?

207
00:27:39,548 --> 00:27:42,418
Daddy, look at her.
She always sports a long face.

208
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:46,706
Look at dad, Mom. He's so happy
to see me off.

209
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:51,639
- But all you know is to shed tears!
- Let me see you off at the airport

210
00:27:52,028 --> 00:27:53,239
You? At the airport?

211
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:58,743
I want to see smiling faces
before I leave. Not crying faces.

212
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,770
- My darling Ma!
- Look after yourself.

213
00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:08,600
I'll return soon. I promise.

214
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:24,342
Take a careful look at the
guy wearing glasses in that crowd.

215
00:28:25,693 --> 00:28:28,114
This man has nothing to do
with our story.

216
00:28:28,508 --> 00:28:31,378
But he's the one who's going
to give the story a new twist.

217
00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:12,022
Watch out... step on the brakes!

218
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:25,156
You know whose blood this is?
Yes, it's Khushi's.

219
00:29:26,252 --> 00:29:30,082
The blood she donated in Chamoli
has journeyed far to reach here.

220
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:31,787
For Karan.

221
00:29:41,293 --> 00:29:43,781
Lali! My child!

222
00:29:47,628 --> 00:29:50,498
Lali, just don't worry.

223
00:29:51,468 --> 00:29:54,338
I've told the priest to find
another suitor for you.

224
00:29:54,765 --> 00:29:57,001
You're going to be married
next week.

225
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:00,425
- Keep quiet, Papa.
- Why, my child?

226
00:30:00,877 --> 00:30:03,943
How can you take such decisions
without even thinking?

227
00:30:04,908 --> 00:30:08,738
Do you know what I've been through?
A groom has just walked out on me.

228
00:30:09,229 --> 00:30:11,618
And you're already thinking
of another marriage?

229
00:30:12,588 --> 00:30:15,622
And I want to study further.
But you...

230
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:20,614
Yes, you wanted to study further.
But I stood in your way

231
00:30:23,148 --> 00:30:28,713
Papa, may I study further?
May I complete my MSc?

232
00:30:29,101 --> 00:30:34,055
How will you study further?
I tore up your application form.

233
00:30:35,693 --> 00:30:37,765
You tore up the form
of Pune University.

234
00:30:37,996 --> 00:30:40,036
But I've also applied
to the Mumbai University.

235
00:30:40,428 --> 00:30:43,941
They've even called me for an interview.
With your permission...

236
00:30:44,268 --> 00:30:48,098
- I'll leave for further studies.
- Bombay University?

237
00:30:50,988 --> 00:30:53,541
How about my signature?

238
00:30:56,748 --> 00:30:59,236
Big deal! It's just Virbhadra Singh.

239
00:30:59,628 --> 00:31:02,498
Just a fowl-scratch.
I've done it already.

240
00:31:05,836 --> 00:31:07,298
Thief!

241
00:31:14,349 --> 00:31:16,258
What's happening?

242
00:31:17,389 --> 00:31:22,091
I saw hands and legs
in plaster...

243
00:31:22,668 --> 00:31:26,498
but not on a whole face!

244
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,954
Moron! Wear your glasses.
That isn't my face.

245
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:32,007
It's over here.

246
00:31:42,893 --> 00:31:46,188
Bastard, you're laughing at me
instead of feeling sorry?

247
00:31:46,668 --> 00:31:48,905
You said you were going to Canada.

248
00:32:01,068 --> 00:32:02,978
You can't leave me
and go away anywhere.

249
00:32:03,373 --> 00:32:06,340
- Karan! My son!
- Greetings.

250
00:32:06,828 --> 00:32:08,933
Mother Goddess!
What's happened to my son?

251
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,667
Mother Goddess...

252
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,770
Why're you angry? She's crying
because you've met with an accident

253
00:32:17,388 --> 00:32:19,298
This accident took place
because she cried.

254
00:32:19,469 --> 00:32:21,989
She cried before I got into the car,
so the accident happened.

255
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:24,105
Thank God she didn't come
to the airport.

256
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:26,276
Had she come there, maybe
the plane would've crashed.

257
00:32:27,373 --> 00:32:30,340
Send me to Canada
some way or the other.

258
00:32:32,044 --> 00:32:35,143
Rascal! Why're you laughing?
I haven't cracked a joke.

259
00:32:35,628 --> 00:32:38,890
It is a joke indeed.
When I broke a little toe...

260
00:32:39,212 --> 00:32:44,580
I was laid up for a week. And you...
you're laid down for 2 months at least

261
00:32:45,293 --> 00:32:49,067
Forget Canada, you can't even
go to the loo for two months.

262
00:32:49,741 --> 00:32:51,945
Why must he shut up?
He's right.

263
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:54,820
The doctor says you need bed rest
for at least two months.

264
00:32:55,213 --> 00:32:57,122
Dad, what happens of my studies?

265
00:32:57,293 --> 00:33:00,260
You so badly wanted
to go to Canada...

266
00:33:00,588 --> 00:33:03,076
that you didn't apply
to any college here.

267
00:33:03,468 --> 00:33:05,705
There's just one way now.

268
00:33:06,348 --> 00:33:08,901
The Vice Chancellor at Mumbai
University is a friend of mine.

269
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:13,384
If you wish, I can have a word with
him and have a seat blocked for you.

270
00:33:14,028 --> 00:33:15,938
Will you go to Mumbai then?

271
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:19,174
What difference does it make
when I can't go to Canada anyway?

272
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:21,130
Be it Calcutta or Mumbai.

273
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:23,138
Looks like you're a huge fan
of Ricky Martin.

274
00:34:25,453 --> 00:34:28,649
I follow a rule. I fit in
with whoever's a big hit.

275
00:34:28,973 --> 00:34:31,787
Whether it's Ricky Martin
or a rusty tin.

276
00:35:27,629 --> 00:35:31,687
Whenever I visit a temple...
I find a lot of peace of mind.

277
00:35:34,188 --> 00:35:37,058
I used to visit the temple in the
village every day. I liked going there.

278
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:43,202
Look at the politician. It looks
as if he's asking God for votes.

279
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:47,778
- What did you say?
- I was only kidding

280
00:37:22,189 --> 00:37:24,098
I've seen you somewhere.

281
00:37:24,653 --> 00:37:27,467
No, that wasn't what
I was getting at. Please.

282
00:37:28,428 --> 00:37:34,179
But it's true that boys use this
line when they want to befriend a girl.

283
00:37:34,605 --> 00:37:36,514
But that wasn't I was getting at.

284
00:37:37,645 --> 00:37:40,198
But I'm speaking the truth.
I've seen you somewhere.

285
00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:43,938
I get that feeling too.

286
00:37:45,581 --> 00:37:48,330
This is the first time we've met,
but somehow I feel...

287
00:37:48,588 --> 00:37:53,706
- as if I've known you for 20 years.
- True. That's how I feel too.

288
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:05,483
You do look happy.

289
00:38:10,093 --> 00:38:11,369
You're here to?

290
00:38:26,028 --> 00:38:29,858
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Yes, in our college.

291
00:38:30,253 --> 00:38:33,122
- In our class?
- No, in the maths section.

292
00:38:33,773 --> 00:38:35,944
- What's her name?
- Priya.

293
00:38:36,492 --> 00:38:39,460
- What hankypanky have you been up to?
- I've been up to no hankypanky.

294
00:38:40,428 --> 00:38:43,690
It's the same old status problem.
She's the daughter of a rich man.

295
00:38:44,012 --> 00:38:48,802
- And I was brought up in an orphanage.
- Why do we always have...

296
00:38:49,068 --> 00:38:51,938
this angle in every love-story?
It's very sad!

297
00:38:55,788 --> 00:38:59,301
- So now?
- Somehow or the other...

298
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:04,168
- I want to reach this letter to her.
- You plan on killing us, do you?

299
00:39:04,684 --> 00:39:06,594
- Madan, please.
- Give it to me

300
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:30,729
Listen, make him see reason.

301
00:39:31,564 --> 00:39:34,696
- If he doesn't understand, finish him.
- Sure.

302
00:39:37,133 --> 00:39:40,613
You've had it, Vicky. Did you have to
fall in love with this guy's daughter?

303
00:39:43,788 --> 00:39:46,472
- Khushi, my dear. How are you?
- I'm all right.

304
00:39:47,437 --> 00:39:50,120
- How's your friend doing at studies?
- Very well.

305
00:40:06,828 --> 00:40:08,738
What are you doing here?

306
00:40:12,588 --> 00:40:14,181
What's that in your hand?

307
00:40:19,373 --> 00:40:22,504
- Yes. How did you know?
- It's all over your face.

308
00:40:23,373 --> 00:40:27,148
Don't you have any manners on
how to behave with a girl in public?

309
00:40:27,629 --> 00:40:30,498
Don't you realise what people
on the streets will think?

310
00:40:31,788 --> 00:40:34,854
You dress so well but you
behave like a cheapskate?

311
00:40:37,548 --> 00:40:40,134
- You're talking any nonsense.
- My mouth, my tongue...

312
00:40:40,332 --> 00:40:42,983
- I will say what I want to.
- But my ears can't listen to all this.

313
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:47,651
- You're hurting my feelings.
- Feelings, I see!

314
00:40:48,108 --> 00:40:51,240
You get friendly at the first meeting
and pass love-letters the next moment!

315
00:40:52,204 --> 00:40:54,114
What feelings are those?
So cheap!

316
00:40:57,069 --> 00:40:59,240
Madam, I haven't written
this love-letter to you.

317
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:01,868
My friend Vicky wrote it
for your friend Priya.

318
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:06,916
He said that she has a strict father
who won't let her take his calls...

319
00:41:07,308 --> 00:41:09,697
and asked me if I could deliver
this letter to Priya.

320
00:41:10,188 --> 00:41:12,676
When I arrived here with the letter,
I found the watchman at the gate.

321
00:41:13,068 --> 00:41:16,265
I was wondering what I could do
when these cars arrived.

322
00:41:16,652 --> 00:41:18,824
There were these deadly thugs
with Priya's father.

323
00:41:18,989 --> 00:41:21,705
I was so shocked to see them,
I didn't know what to do.

324
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:23,938
That's when I saw you
walking out with Priya.

325
00:41:24,076 --> 00:41:27,459
Khushi! She's the girl I met
at the temple.

326
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:31,105
I thought my friend's work was done.
I'd send the letter to her through you.

327
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:35,331
But you, you tell me that I don't
have any sense, any manners...

328
00:41:35,533 --> 00:41:37,159
Who do you think you are?

329
00:41:37,389 --> 00:41:40,258
Maybe you have a tongue.
But you also brains to think.

330
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:06,633
We've been studying in the same college
and yet we didn't know each other.

331
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:08,006
That's strange, isn't it?

332
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:13,542
- Strange also that we're here together.
- For love.

333
00:42:13,996 --> 00:42:16,811
- For love?
- Yes. Priya and Vicky's love.

334
00:42:20,045 --> 00:42:23,307
- What did you think?
- Nothing at all.

335
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,600
May I ask something?
Have you ever fallen in love?

336
00:42:28,908 --> 00:42:30,250
You?

337
00:42:31,021 --> 00:42:33,061
- Why not?
- Why not?

338
00:42:33,708 --> 00:42:37,156
What will I say?
Why didn't you fall in love?

339
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:42,050
- I don't know.
- You don't know how to fall in love?

340
00:42:43,501 --> 00:42:45,028
So you do?

341
00:42:58,093 --> 00:42:59,620
Shall we leave, Vicky?

342
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:30,667
- What for?
- For dropping me home.

343
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:34,178
You say thanks when a stranger
drops you home.

344
00:43:34,669 --> 00:43:37,833
We're not strangers anymore.
So why be so formal?

345
00:43:38,988 --> 00:43:41,858
But I've already said thanks.
What do we do?

346
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:46,025
You must withdraw the words.

347
00:44:05,868 --> 00:44:10,091
Students, the cultural programme
at the college begins very soon!

348
00:45:43,853 --> 00:45:45,707
- What happened?
- It's open.

349
00:45:47,053 --> 00:45:49,922
The way you reacted over such
a trivial thing, I got really scared.

350
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:58,185
This is how friends should be.
Your friend showed trust in you...

351
00:45:58,509 --> 00:46:02,338
and gave you an open personal letter.
He must have so much of faith in you.

352
00:46:02,988 --> 00:46:05,061
That's not such a big thing.
You may read it, if you wish to.

353
00:46:08,748 --> 00:46:10,658
Your friend gave it to you,
because he trusted you.

354
00:46:10,861 --> 00:46:12,771
You gave it to me,
because you trust me.

355
00:46:13,005 --> 00:46:16,998
And my friend has faith in me.
We must never betray someone's faith.

356
00:46:19,564 --> 00:46:22,826
What's the big deal?
The letter says, Dear Priya...

357
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:25,636
I can't take you
to the movies this Friday.

358
00:46:25,932 --> 00:46:28,267
I've got to go to Nashik for 2 days,
so please don't be angry with me.

359
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:30,824
I don't know what I will do
without you these 2 days.

360
00:46:31,276 --> 00:46:35,619
There's so much I will miss.
You, your voice, your lovely eyes...

361
00:46:35,949 --> 00:46:40,105
your cheeks, beautiful lips,
the ones I kiss...

362
00:46:40,876 --> 00:46:44,706
your lap, in which I rest my head.
I will keep saying...

363
00:46:50,509 --> 00:46:52,418
Must you read someone's letter?

364
00:46:55,597 --> 00:46:57,866
It's a love-letter!
Full of personal emotions.

365
00:46:59,085 --> 00:47:01,867
You've let your friend down.
You have betrayed his trust.

366
00:47:06,509 --> 00:47:07,785
You're a dirty man...

367
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:15,500
Are you through?
May I speak now?

368
00:47:16,908 --> 00:47:21,698
Vicky hurt his thumb, not me.
It was bleeding.

369
00:47:22,285 --> 00:47:24,586
Can someone write when
he has a hurt thumb?

370
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:29,640
No? So he dictated letter to me
and I wrote it for him. Get it?

371
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:33,218
You need more explanation?
You just need an opportunity...

372
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:35,851
to fly off the handle
and you won't stop.

373
00:47:38,413 --> 00:47:41,479
And you even say sorry.
Know what?

374
00:47:41,868 --> 00:47:45,381
Record I'm sorry on a cassette
a thousand times...

375
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:48,578
because you use those words
often and often. Okay?

376
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:15,266
- What happened?
- The fan-belt seems to have snapped

377
00:48:15,533 --> 00:48:17,387
I had one fixed just yesterday.

378
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:22,824
- What do we do now?
- We'll lock it up and walk.

379
00:48:25,389 --> 00:48:27,298
The mechanic will take it away
in the morning.

380
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:34,658
- Khushi, what are you thinking about?
- Nothing.

381
00:48:35,053 --> 00:48:36,962
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing.

382
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:40,162
Khushi, if I ask you a question
will you answer me?

383
00:48:43,693 --> 00:48:45,602
Whom do you like most?

384
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:51,941
- The most...? My Papa.
- Of course.

385
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,778
Everyone of us loves his Papa.
He's the one who brings us up.

386
00:48:58,989 --> 00:49:02,250
Apart from Papa,
who else do you like?

387
00:49:03,468 --> 00:49:08,968
- Apart from Papa... my Mummy.
- Who can forget Mummy.

388
00:49:09,549 --> 00:49:12,102
Mummy is great. At her feet
lie the heavens.

389
00:49:12,812 --> 00:49:17,864
Look outside the house. Whom do
you like, apart from your folks?

390
00:49:29,453 --> 00:49:31,111
Who doesn't like him?

391
00:49:38,028 --> 00:49:43,396
Look away from the film industry.
There must be someone else?

392
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:49,223
- There is...
- There is?

393
00:49:50,764 --> 00:49:52,936
- Who?
- Sachin Tendulkar.

394
00:50:04,908 --> 00:50:10,473
Khushi, fathers, mothers, actors
and cricketers are all so common.

395
00:50:11,149 --> 00:50:17,379
Everyone likes them. But whom do you
like specially and personally?

396
00:50:24,108 --> 00:50:26,018
Khushi... wait.

397
00:50:28,908 --> 00:50:32,105
- What happened?
- Tell me the name.

398
00:50:32,557 --> 00:50:36,331
And I'll say that I like him.
But please don't bother me like this.

399
00:50:37,548 --> 00:50:39,458
So what's the name?

400
00:50:43,308 --> 00:50:44,737
Never mind.

401
00:52:00,108 --> 00:52:02,345
I was supposed to come, but...

402
00:52:03,948 --> 00:52:05,672
Have you seen Karan around?

403
00:52:05,868 --> 00:52:08,421
- Is it your birthday?
- No.

404
00:52:08,748 --> 00:52:11,301
- Something special at home?
- No. Why?

405
00:52:12,109 --> 00:52:14,280
Your new dress and the sparkle?

406
00:52:16,237 --> 00:52:19,684
- Nothing of the sort. Where's Karan?
- He's there in the corridor.

407
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,338
He wasn't there.
That's where I came from.

408
00:52:22,669 --> 00:52:25,058
Maybe, but he's in
the telephone booth.

409
00:52:26,669 --> 00:52:28,098
In the telephone booth?

410
00:52:32,748 --> 00:52:34,472
Please try to understand me.

411
00:52:36,269 --> 00:52:38,822
I couldn't come because my friends
asked me to stay back.

412
00:52:39,468 --> 00:52:41,378
Hello... Madhu.

413
00:52:43,308 --> 00:52:45,992
We have two or three days off
again next month.

414
00:52:46,509 --> 00:52:48,265
Yes, I promise.

415
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:57,382
There's still a week, right?
So let me make up for it.

416
00:53:11,148 --> 00:53:13,058
Were you waiting for me?

417
00:53:14,988 --> 00:53:18,818
- Well? You aren't looking nice today.
- Oh yes, that's what you will say.

418
00:53:19,213 --> 00:53:21,384
Oh no, you're really
looking very beautiful.

419
00:53:21,773 --> 00:53:24,587
- I spoke just the opposite.
- That's how you've always been.

420
00:53:24,973 --> 00:53:27,275
I was only kidding.
Why're you taking it seriously?

421
00:53:29,644 --> 00:53:31,554
Khushi's looking for you.

422
00:53:36,301 --> 00:53:39,618
- Were you looking for me?
- Yes.

423
00:53:40,013 --> 00:53:43,144
- What for?
- It was something important.

424
00:53:43,532 --> 00:53:45,442
But I've forgotten what it was.

425
00:53:52,845 --> 00:53:55,528
- Who?
- Who and who?

426
00:53:56,268 --> 00:53:58,570
- On the phone.
- Madhu.

427
00:53:59,148 --> 00:54:00,807
- Madhu who?
- My Ma.

428
00:54:01,068 --> 00:54:02,595
- Ma?
- Yes.

429
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,210
But you were uttering her name.

430
00:54:07,788 --> 00:54:10,658
That's my mother's name and
I address my mother by her name.

431
00:54:18,348 --> 00:54:19,428
Yes, Ma.

432
00:54:25,453 --> 00:54:26,795
Yes, Ma.

433
00:54:36,013 --> 00:54:39,144
Get cracking. The show begins in
two hours. I don't have time to waste.

434
00:54:42,348 --> 00:54:44,072
Remember your step?

435
00:54:46,188 --> 00:54:48,872
- You always teach me the same step.
- Because that's all I know.

436
00:54:49,261 --> 00:54:51,716
What? Can you show me
something else?

437
00:55:14,988 --> 00:55:17,858
For the last 10 years, I've been
in this college like a milestone.

438
00:55:18,828 --> 00:55:23,946
My juniors have turned professors.
But my friends, my cronies, I...

439
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:26,210
Enough. I get it.

440
00:55:56,941 --> 00:55:58,185
Meaning?

441
00:56:00,108 --> 00:56:02,792
Meaning... she's a friend.

01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:17,755
- Were you scared?
- No.

470
01:02:22,748 --> 01:02:24,439
- What's this?
- A gift.

471
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:25,206
For me?

472
01:02:31,484 --> 01:02:33,939
What's the hurry?
Open it later.

473
01:02:45,788 --> 01:02:47,698
Necessary for smokers.

474
01:02:48,668 --> 01:02:50,872
- Where did you buy it?
- Akbarallys.

475
01:02:52,508 --> 01:02:54,232
- For how much?
- 5000.

476
01:02:55,581 --> 01:02:56,530
5000?

477
01:02:57,629 --> 01:02:59,538
An ashtray? For 5000?

478
01:03:01,148 --> 01:03:04,345
It's no ordinary ashtray.
It's made from French crystal glass.

479
01:03:04,732 --> 01:03:07,121
It's expensive because of
its intricate art-work.

480
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:09,778
It's very nice indeed.

481
01:03:10,813 --> 01:03:14,129
But you could have given me
another gift instead of this.

482
01:03:17,757 --> 01:03:20,343
It's such an expensive
and beautiful ashtray...

483
01:03:21,308 --> 01:03:26,098
I'd hate to drop ash in it
when I smoke.

484
01:03:28,028 --> 01:03:30,898
That's exactly why I got
this ashtray.

485
01:03:31,356 --> 01:03:34,226
Because whenever you drop ash,
you must remember me.

486
01:03:34,748 --> 01:03:37,367
And you must feel that
you're dropping ash...

487
01:03:37,628 --> 01:03:39,538
not in the ashtray, but on me.

488
01:03:40,893 --> 01:03:44,341
So you must give up smoking.

489
01:03:49,309 --> 01:03:50,738
Karan quits smoking?

490
01:03:53,244 --> 01:03:56,561
Ask me for anything else, and I'll
do it. But give up smoking? No way.

491
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:01,083
If you...

492
01:04:03,804 --> 01:04:05,463
respect me...

493
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:10,258
you will give up smoking.

494
01:04:36,261 --> 01:04:37,439
Happy?

495
01:05:38,628 --> 01:05:40,352
For the exams.
I'm studying.

496
01:06:30,909 --> 01:06:34,040
- That's not nice.
- What?

497
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:36,504
That which you're doing.

498
01:06:38,621 --> 01:06:40,148
Reading a book is a nice thing.

499
01:06:40,348 --> 01:06:43,861
In any case, it isn't porn.
It's a college book.

500
01:06:44,284 --> 01:06:46,423
I'm not talking about
what you're reading.

501
01:06:46,812 --> 01:06:48,984
I'm talking about the thing
you've been staring at.

502
01:06:52,061 --> 01:06:54,428
Yes, I've been taking a good look.

503
01:06:54,813 --> 01:06:57,180
Don't switch the topic.
You...

504
01:07:00,925 --> 01:07:02,834
you were staring at my waist.

505
01:07:04,348 --> 01:07:06,967
- Don't pretend! You were watching it!
- I didn't.

506
01:07:07,228 --> 01:07:09,138
- You did too!
- I didn't, I say.

507
01:07:09,596 --> 01:07:12,979
And I say you did. You did!
I caught you staring at it!

508
01:07:19,133 --> 01:07:23,541
Well, maybe my eyes wandered
when I was turning a page.

509
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:26,165
But I didn't have any intentions.

510
01:07:26,621 --> 01:07:30,265
You haven't been here a minute,
nor have you read a page...

511
01:07:30,749 --> 01:07:33,138
- but you looked at it a dozen times!
- Now look, Khushi...

512
01:07:33,533 --> 01:07:37,559
- you're mistaking me.
- What...? I'm making a mistake...

513
01:07:37,821 --> 01:07:39,348
or was it you?

514
01:07:42,748 --> 01:07:45,618
Remember all those things! When
I gave you Vicky's open letter...

515
01:07:45,884 --> 01:07:48,251
when I told you about its contents,
what did you say?

516
01:07:48,508 --> 01:07:50,418
One must never look at
other's private affairs.

517
01:07:50,589 --> 01:07:55,706
You called me so many names!
Didn't you?

518
01:07:56,188 --> 01:08:00,378
When I told you that he had hurt
his thumb and that I had written...

519
01:08:00,669 --> 01:08:02,709
the letter for him,
you said sorry to me.

520
01:08:02,908 --> 01:08:04,250
Didn't you?

521
01:08:05,821 --> 01:08:07,610
Never mind that.
Let's talk about our first meeting.

522
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:10,327
When I gave you that letter
Vicky wanted delivered to Priya...

523
01:08:10,588 --> 01:08:12,498
what conclusion did you jump to?
That I was giving you the letter.

524
01:08:12,669 --> 01:08:14,578
You yelled so much at me.

525
01:08:23,068 --> 01:08:25,524
Didn't you yell at me?
But when you got to know the truth...

526
01:08:25,692 --> 01:08:29,784
you said sorry. Didn't you?
I know what you want.

527
01:08:30,205 --> 01:08:32,660
You want everyone to praise your
beauty, to be crazy about you...

528
01:08:32,989 --> 01:08:35,061
and say I love you to you.
And when someone does that...

529
01:08:35,292 --> 01:08:37,081
you get worked up,
you kick up a fuss...

530
01:08:37,212 --> 01:08:41,042
you start accusing him and say that
he's after girls. Isn't that right?

531
01:08:41,469 --> 01:08:44,949
Talk about me...
not about other girls.

532
01:08:45,341 --> 01:08:48,985
What do you know about
girls' psychology? What?

533
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:51,675
We don't pretend! I don't pretend!
But you do!

534
01:08:53,788 --> 01:08:54,999
You do!

535
01:08:55,933 --> 01:08:58,322
What did you do at the restaurant
the other day?

536
01:08:58,653 --> 01:09:03,704
You deliberately dropped your spoon,
so you could use my spoon to eat!

537
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:07,545
You did put on an act then.
What were you hiding on?

538
01:09:09,213 --> 01:09:12,595
The other day, you said your car had
broken down and that we'd have to walk.

539
01:09:12,988 --> 01:09:16,818
And what did you ask me?
Whom did you like most?

540
01:09:17,213 --> 01:09:18,904
You bored me to death!

541
01:09:19,773 --> 01:09:22,587
And when your daddy come to the
college, you introduced everyone...

542
01:09:28,765 --> 01:09:31,034
Why didn't you say it freely?

543
01:09:32,188 --> 01:09:35,505
Why did you hesitate then?
What feelings were you hiding?

544
01:09:36,028 --> 01:09:38,898
Oh sure, despite
knowing everything...

545
01:09:39,229 --> 01:09:41,530
why've you been acting as
if you didn't know anything?

546
01:09:41,788 --> 01:09:43,512
What will I take that for?

547
01:09:43,773 --> 01:09:46,326
Despite knowing everything,
you gifted me an ashtray.

548
01:09:46,653 --> 01:09:48,507
Okay, you gave that to me
as a friend.

549
01:09:48,764 --> 01:09:51,001
But when I was talking to my Ma
the other day...

550
01:09:51,197 --> 01:09:52,658
when I was showering kisses on her...

551
01:09:52,765 --> 01:09:55,132
why did you badly
want to know the truth?

552
01:09:55,389 --> 01:09:58,804
You calmed down only after you
got to know that Madhu's my Ma.

553
01:10:00,061 --> 01:10:03,444
You presented me an ashtray.
All right, maybe that's friendship.

554
01:10:03,868 --> 01:10:08,375
But the restlessness you showed
when you wanted to know about my Ma...

555
01:10:08,668 --> 01:10:11,003
the streak of possessiveness you
showed, what do I take that for?

556
01:10:20,092 --> 01:10:23,060
Let's not stray from the point.
Didn't you stare at my waist?

557
01:10:24,669 --> 01:10:26,905
Haven't you loved me?

558
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:29,170
- No.
- I didn't stare either.

559
01:10:35,548 --> 01:10:39,378
I happen to talk to a girl
and she finds faults with me!

560
01:10:40,348 --> 01:10:42,585
I can't ever be friends
with an egoistic girl like her!

561
01:10:42,813 --> 01:10:44,723
Even if we are friends,
it's never going to lead to love.

562
01:10:44,892 --> 01:10:46,802
Even if we fall in love,
we'll never marry.

563
01:10:46,941 --> 01:10:48,850
And even if we somehow
make it to the marriage altar...

564
01:10:48,988 --> 01:10:53,211
I'll say that I can't marry a girl
like her and run away from there!

565
01:10:56,668 --> 01:10:57,813
What a girl!

566
01:11:06,653 --> 01:11:10,428
You have no right to
talk about my character.

567
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:15,861
I'll forget that I ever
met someone called Karan.

568
01:11:17,788 --> 01:11:21,618
You and I have nothing
to do with each other.

569
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,951
She looks like a twin-sister
of our master.

570
01:12:00,178 --> 01:12:04,007
Excuse me, you're not
our master's twin, are you?

571
01:12:04,402 --> 01:12:07,272
Oh no. There are only
sisters in our family.

572
01:12:08,562 --> 01:12:11,431
It's the master himself.
What disguise is this, Master?

573
01:12:11,762 --> 01:12:16,497
What? People go to great lengths
to have an album released.

574
01:12:16,882 --> 01:12:19,370
I've only changed my name.
From Madan to Badan Bhosle.

575
01:12:19,762 --> 01:12:23,472
- So what's wrong?
- Name an album of yours, Master.

576
01:12:24,017 --> 01:12:26,538
- Don't be stubborn, my love.
- How about humming the tune?

577
01:12:27,058 --> 01:12:29,479
The tune? It's fantastic.

578
01:12:30,194 --> 01:12:33,772
I've really worked hard on this song.
When it's released...

579
01:12:34,098 --> 01:12:37,775
it's going to kick up a storm.
Want me to sing it for you?

hit album Jaanam Samjha Karo.

585
01:13:07,378 --> 01:13:10,411
What nonsense!
That's the title of a movie!

586
01:13:11,218 --> 01:13:13,901
The album of the same name was a hit,
but the film was shit.

587
01:13:16,306 --> 01:13:20,496
- What's between you and me?
- That's for you to decide, sir.

588
01:13:20,818 --> 01:13:23,371
I'll decide later. Now tell me
what do you mean to me?

589
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:25,480
- Your secretary, sir.
- And what's a secretary's job?

590
01:13:25,618 --> 01:13:29,131
You must go out in the market and
find out which album is doing well...

591
01:13:29,362 --> 01:13:32,493
and what the get up is...
so that they don't clash with ours.

592
01:13:33,298 --> 01:13:34,891
What sorry?

593
01:13:35,314 --> 01:13:39,056
- Well, sir...
- No wells! That's it.

594
01:13:40,274 --> 01:13:42,663
- Want me to sing another song?
- Sure. Go ahead.

01:14:34,962 --> 01:14:36,871
Why? Is that wrong?

600
01:14:37,266 --> 01:14:38,956
I don't want to...

601
01:14:40,754 --> 01:14:42,215
with you...

602
01:14:45,618 --> 01:14:49,131
I don't want any argument.
I have something important to say.

603
01:14:50,226 --> 01:14:52,714
During the summer vacations
when we were not around...

604
01:14:53,106 --> 01:14:56,816
a lot of things have taken place.
Vicky went to meet Priya at her place.

605
01:14:57,202 --> 01:14:59,439
He mistook her father for her
and awakened him.

606
01:14:59,858 --> 01:15:01,418
He was caught.

607
01:15:03,729 --> 01:15:06,413
Priya's father is holding her
captive in the house.

608
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:09,287
- Did Vicky attend class?
- No

609
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:13,771
The love affair we promoted
is now facing problems.

610
01:15:15,186 --> 01:15:17,936
I'm talking about Vicky
and Priya's love affair.

611
01:15:20,946 --> 01:15:22,440
Did you meet Priya?

612
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:27,985
- I mean, have you?
- Yes.

613
01:15:28,818 --> 01:15:32,331
I've come from her house right now.
She was crying.

614
01:15:33,106 --> 01:15:41,355
I told her not to worry. To unite her
with Vicky is my duty, I promised her.

615
01:15:41,938 --> 01:15:46,094
And you have promised your friend
to unite the two of them.

616
01:15:47,954 --> 01:15:51,532
So, to honour the promise
I've made to my friend...

617
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:55,370
and for you to honour the promise
you've made to your friend, we must...

618
01:15:57,298 --> 01:15:58,727
We must?

619
01:16:01,138 --> 01:16:03,691
We must get together
and unite them.

620
01:16:08,818 --> 01:16:14,568
We must... what I'm saying is that
...I want to make it clear.

621
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:22,252
In uniting them, the relationship
we are going to share...

622
01:16:22,642 --> 01:16:24,813
is what I'll decide right now.

623
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:32,814
It will not be love, no friendship
and no relationship at all.

624
01:16:37,682 --> 01:16:41,457
Our relationship will last as long
as they are united.

625
01:16:45,522 --> 01:16:50,410
I hope you will do that.

626
01:16:52,434 --> 01:16:56,209
That you will do it,
I am convinced.

627
01:16:58,802 --> 01:17:02,315
What can I say now?
You've said what I wanted to.

628
01:17:04,498 --> 01:17:06,734
Shall we go to meet Vicky?

629
01:17:25,682 --> 01:17:28,813
You're the limit! You couldn't
wait for two months.

630
01:17:32,338 --> 01:17:36,680
All I want to know is what you told
Priya's old man when you woke him up.

631
01:17:37,010 --> 01:17:38,920
Priya darling, here I am?
Or was it...

632
01:17:39,058 --> 01:17:40,781
Sorry, Uncle. Wrong number?

633
01:17:43,858 --> 01:17:46,541
This is exactly why I tell you
not to fall in love!

634
01:17:46,898 --> 01:17:50,378
Look at me. I'm such a happy man!
And why?

635
01:17:50,834 --> 01:17:55,689
Because I'm not in love with someone!
And I don't have any problems like you.

636
01:17:56,626 --> 01:17:59,790
Look at your face. You look like
the perfect jilted-lover.

637
01:18:07,345 --> 01:18:13,292
To hide your pain and fake a laughter
is nothing but stupidity.

638
01:18:13,809 --> 01:18:16,809
- What?
- I'm talking about Vicky's pain.

639
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:19,280
The one you're feeling too.

640
01:18:20,338 --> 01:18:24,167
Will it solve the problem by
feeling the pain and crying? No.

641
01:18:27,762 --> 01:18:30,893
Just concentrate on your studies,
Vicky. As for your love...

642
01:18:31,282 --> 01:18:34,730
leave it to us. To unite you
with Priya is our responsibility.

643
01:18:37,201 --> 01:18:40,649
Can't you trust my words?
All right.

644
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:45,549
But you do trust your love,
don't you? If your love is true...

645
01:18:45,874 --> 01:18:48,940
it'll surely unite the two of you.
Am I right?

646
01:18:51,058 --> 01:18:54,505
If our love is true,
it'll surely unite us.

647
01:18:59,122 --> 01:19:02,253
- Yes.
- Yes, yes indeed

648
01:19:20,342 --> 01:19:22,960
Where's the need to walk?
I'll drop you home.

649
01:19:26,998 --> 01:19:31,471
You needn't necessarily be my
girlfriend for me to drop you home.

650
01:19:32,566 --> 01:19:35,632
It doesn't need a relationship at all.
You could say...

651
01:19:35,958 --> 01:19:38,129
you've taken a ride
in a stranger's car.

652
01:19:38,582 --> 01:19:41,713
And I'll think I gave a ride
to a girl who was a stranger

653
01:19:44,662 --> 01:19:49,070
If you still want to walk,
it's up to you.

654
01:19:50,038 --> 01:19:52,143
What can I do about it?

655
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:55,215
I live in the hostel now.
Not in that flat.

656
01:19:56,758 --> 01:20:00,271
To distance myself from some one,
I had to stay at the hostel.

657
01:20:04,629 --> 01:20:06,801
I'll drop you at the hostel then.

I haven’t done anything this time.
It has stalled on its own.

687
01:26:11,218 --> 01:26:13,127
The wire of the spark-plug
has come off.

688
01:26:53,354 --> 01:26:57,315
When a stranger drops me home,
I always thank him.

689
01:26:58,282 --> 01:27:00,770
- That's a habit of mine.
- Nice habit too.

690
01:27:09,429 --> 01:27:14,732
Because of my native tongue, you got
to know that I'm from the villages!

691
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:16,910
- You want to rob me?
- No, sir.

692
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:20,757
Thief! I asked you to take me
to Mumbai University and...

693
01:27:21,142 --> 01:27:23,379
you've been taking me around Mumbai!

694
01:27:23,926 --> 01:27:26,130
You've been driving
around the same place!

695
01:27:26,518 --> 01:27:28,689
Forget it, sir.
It's human to err.

696
01:27:28,854 --> 01:27:31,090
Looks like you're
hand in glove with him.

697
01:27:34,198 --> 01:27:36,751
Please let him go, Uncle.

698
01:27:38,998 --> 01:27:41,201
Come with me.
I'll give you a ride.

699
01:27:42,294 --> 01:27:46,036
You don't appear to be a cabbie.
Why will you give me a ride?

700
01:27:46,358 --> 01:27:48,268
He's the one who'll take me there.
You go on.

701
01:27:50,518 --> 01:27:53,201
Until you leave, no one else
will be able to move from here.

702
01:27:53,718 --> 01:27:55,758
The traffic's come to a standstill
because of you.

703
01:27:57,238 --> 01:28:00,620
I study at the Bombay University too.
Come with me, I'll take you there.

704
01:28:04,918 --> 01:28:06,641
You take me to be an idiot?

705
01:28:09,718 --> 01:28:11,441
The moron!

706
01:28:13,878 --> 01:28:17,391
Son, how do you live in this city?

707
01:28:18,774 --> 01:28:21,556
Everyone here appears to be
a fraud to me.

708
01:28:23,158 --> 01:28:24,980
But you're a nice boy.

709
01:28:26,358 --> 01:28:28,594
Guess what I like most about you?

710
01:28:31,158 --> 01:28:32,751
Your smile.

711
01:28:34,678 --> 01:28:38,191
- Do you know my daughter?
- Who?

712
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:46,579
How would you know her? There must
be so many girls in the college.

713
01:28:48,118 --> 01:28:53,300
- There's this hostel near the college.
- Which hostel?

714
01:28:54,038 --> 01:28:58,675
Now what is the name?
Mary...

715
01:29:03,702 --> 01:29:06,353
Right, St Mary's Girls Hostel!

716
01:29:08,278 --> 01:29:10,896
- Do you know where the hostel is?
- Know?

717
01:29:13,302 --> 01:29:16,171
- I can't ever forget that hostel.
- Why?

718
01:29:17,302 --> 01:29:19,604
There's this girl I know
who stays there.

719
01:29:20,150 --> 01:29:23,979
She's no ordinary girl, mind you.
She has a massive ego.

720
01:29:24,662 --> 01:29:26,833
- What?
- Ego.

721
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:31,310
- Meaning?
- Ego meaning...

722
01:29:32,918 --> 01:29:35,635
she thinks she's the last word.

723
01:29:38,998 --> 01:29:43,275
Even when she knows she's wrong,
she'll never say sorry.

724
01:29:47,158 --> 01:29:49,068
This damn ego...

725
01:29:50,038 --> 01:29:55,308
how will I explain it?
This girl...

726
01:29:56,022 --> 01:29:59,317
she's stubborn, a bit eccentric...

727
01:30:02,998 --> 01:30:08,180
I get it. That daughter
of an ass is arrogant.

728
01:30:08,758 --> 01:30:10,099
Yes, arrogant!

729
01:30:14,518 --> 01:30:19,307
I wanted to tell you about the girl,
but you've spoken about her family!

730
01:30:27,254 --> 01:30:33,713
She's just a girl, you know.
If she can be so arrogant...

731
01:30:34,102 --> 01:30:36,590
- am I any less?
- Oh yes

732
01:30:41,142 --> 01:30:42,352
Oh yes!

733
01:30:44,725 --> 01:30:45,674
Oh yes!

734
01:30:50,038 --> 01:30:54,445
- That's the block.
- Thank you very much

735
01:30:55,158 --> 01:31:00,755
I live in Chamoli, son. If you ever
visit the place, do meet me.

736
01:31:02,518 --> 01:31:03,695
See you.

737
01:31:06,102 --> 01:31:07,825
Lali! My child!

738
01:31:10,262 --> 01:31:12,117
- How are you?
- I'm fine

739
01:31:12,565 --> 01:31:14,987
- Why're you so late?
- What will I tell you?

740
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:18,193
On my way, I got into
a fight with a cabbie.

741
01:31:18,646 --> 01:31:22,191
It was a terrible fight and
this nice boy really helped me.

742
01:31:22,998 --> 01:31:25,365
He... one moment!

743
01:31:27,222 --> 01:31:29,393
Hello son... hello!

744
01:31:29,782 --> 01:31:31,571
Come here.

745
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:34,379
Lali, come here.

746
01:31:50,518 --> 01:31:54,347
As I was telling you, I got into
a fight with a crazy cabbie.

747
01:31:54,934 --> 01:31:57,934
And a decent boy came along
and helped me. He's the one.

748
01:31:58,710 --> 01:32:00,433
This is my daughter, Lali.

749
01:32:13,558 --> 01:32:16,689
- Have some coffee before you leave.
- Thanks, but I've got to go.

750
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:20,939
Oh no. Back in the village, we don't
let a guest go away without...

751
01:32:21,238 --> 01:32:24,369
extending our hospitality. If you
leave without having coffee...

752
01:32:24,598 --> 01:32:27,315
I'm going to feel bad.
Tell him to stay, dear.

753
01:32:31,029 --> 01:32:32,939
Please have some coffee.

754
01:32:35,638 --> 01:32:40,820
- I'll go and lock my car.
- All right. Let's go.

755
01:32:43,509 --> 01:32:45,965
- I don't want to get married.
- Why not?

756
01:32:46,582 --> 01:32:49,070
When you wanted to study further,
I agreed with you.

757
01:32:49,398 --> 01:32:52,267
And now that I want you to get
married, you must listen to me.

758
01:32:53,878 --> 01:32:56,049
Come, son.
Have some coffee.

759
01:32:56,566 --> 01:32:59,054
- I just don't agree!
- Why not?

760
01:32:59,446 --> 01:33:01,748
Look at her, son.
She's not listening to me.

761
01:33:07,126 --> 01:33:10,508
- You must listen to Papa, mustn't you?
- Do you know what he's saying?

762
01:33:11,158 --> 01:33:14,027
And this is between the two of us.
You aren't interfering.

763
01:33:14,485 --> 01:33:17,552
You'll get a slap, Lali.
He's a guest...

764
01:33:17,878 --> 01:33:22,188
is that how you talk to a guest?
What wrong have I said, son?

765
01:33:22,678 --> 01:33:25,296
I'm looking for a groom for her
and she's refusing me.

766
01:33:29,654 --> 01:33:34,891
When a girl keeps refusing to get
married, what does it mean?

767
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:38,990
It means there is someone else
she loves.

768
01:33:40,022 --> 01:33:44,113
I'm not against that. All I want
is for you to have a nice wedding.

769
01:33:44,822 --> 01:33:50,321
But how should the suitor be?
He must be just like this boy.

770
01:33:52,438 --> 01:33:57,042
Clean-hearted, innocent eyes...
a handsome young man.

771
01:33:59,478 --> 01:34:03,307
If there is someone you love,
tell me about it.

772
01:34:05,878 --> 01:34:08,049
I'm not in love with anyone.

773
01:34:08,758 --> 01:34:12,019
If you really don't love anyone,
you must obey your Papa.

774
01:34:14,518 --> 01:34:18,347
- Papa, I'm willing to get married.
- Wow!

775
01:34:20,374 --> 01:34:21,999
This is amazing!

776
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:24,816
I've been trying for so long
and she just wouldn't agree.

777
01:34:25,078 --> 01:34:28,274
You spoke to her just once
and viola! She agreed!

778
01:34:29,078 --> 01:34:31,795
Looks like we share the
same birth-sign, son.

779
01:34:32,758 --> 01:34:35,627
I had a problem with the cabbie
and you solved.

780
01:34:36,598 --> 01:34:39,467
And this problem of her marriage
you have solved too.

781
01:34:40,438 --> 01:34:44,496
I'm happy to have achieved
what I set out to do.

782
01:34:45,014 --> 01:34:48,276
Lali, I'm leaving by this
evening's train.

783
01:34:48,694 --> 01:34:50,549
Do look after yourself, okay?

784
01:34:50,870 --> 01:34:53,685
Come on... drop me on the way

785
01:34:57,814 --> 01:35:01,556
Lali, I forgot to tell you
something very important.

786
01:35:02,518 --> 01:35:05,136
There's a girl he knows
who stays here.

787
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:09,685
They have a fight going
between themselves.

788
01:35:12,118 --> 01:35:14,671
- Never mind, Uncle. Please...
- Now wait a moment.

789
01:35:14,998 --> 01:35:17,681
Won't I do anything for all the help
you've extended to me?

790
01:35:18,038 --> 01:35:19,532
What will people say?

791
01:35:19,798 --> 01:35:26,508
She's a very arrogant girl, Lali.
As he said, she's very stubborn too.

792
01:35:26,934 --> 01:35:29,803
Not just stubborn, she's...

793
01:35:31,318 --> 01:35:35,474
a bit mental, eko...
what word did you use?

794
01:35:36,118 --> 01:35:40,373
- Never mind, Uncle. Forget it...
- Give me the word! What was it?

795
01:35:43,989 --> 01:35:48,975
Yes! Ego!
She's possessed by ego!

796
01:35:49,558 --> 01:35:53,005
Like spirits taking possession
of people's bodies...

797
01:35:53,398 --> 01:35:55,983
this girl is possessed with ego!

798
01:35:57,685 --> 01:36:02,028
Ask the girl not to
fight with him, dear.

799
01:36:02,422 --> 01:36:06,252
He's a very nice boy. Even my Papa
believes he's a very nice boy.

800
01:36:06,742 --> 01:36:08,651
Bring the two of them together.
Okay?

801
01:36:10,934 --> 01:36:14,895
Will that be enough or do you want me
to stay over for your help, son?

802
01:36:15,286 --> 01:36:17,391
No thank you, Uncle.
You've done so much!

803
01:36:17,782 --> 01:36:20,270
That's all right...
See you.

804
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:25,645
She's a fool to get into a fight
with a nice boy like you.

805
01:36:26,198 --> 01:36:29,231
It isn't her fault. It must be
her father who...

806
01:36:29,622 --> 01:36:33,135
has really pampered
the arrogant girl.

807
01:36:35,158 --> 01:36:39,152
What has come to be?
And why?

808
01:36:40,918 --> 01:36:45,457
Don't think about it...

809
01:36:47,638 --> 01:36:55,309
Think, how could that girl blow such
a little thing out of proportion?

810
01:36:57,942 --> 01:37:03,474
I can't get this. This little part
of the female anatomy...

811
01:37:05,398 --> 01:37:10,187
- Don't remind me, please!
- Everyone gets to look at it.

812
01:37:10,678 --> 01:37:17,486
What went wrong if you looked at it?
In Mumbai, girls expose their legs.

813
01:37:17,878 --> 01:37:19,787
This is just what
I can't understand!

814
01:37:22,165 --> 01:37:28,428
Your friend Shibu has come all the
way from Kolkata to solve your problem.

815
01:37:29,398 --> 01:37:31,307
And I'll solve it too.

816
01:37:35,798 --> 01:37:39,410
Look at this. Once this goes in,
your woes will vanish.

817
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:45,710
No thanks. I don't drink.
I don't want it.

818
01:37:45,974 --> 01:37:51,473
Drink it up... listen to me.
Just a little... come on.

819
01:37:58,198 --> 01:37:59,474
Fun?

820
01:38:02,038 --> 01:38:06,577
I'll now sing a hit song for you.

821
01:38:07,798 --> 01:38:10,034
You'll find happiness.

822
01:38:29,334 --> 01:38:34,189
Shut up! You make me sadder!

823
01:38:34,678 --> 01:38:38,834
Drink some more. The more you drink,
the more your problems will vanish.

824
01:38:41,718 --> 01:38:44,271
You didn't approve of the
Bengali song, did you?

825
01:38:44,821 --> 01:38:46,960
I'll sing a song from Mumbai
for you.

826
01:38:50,038 --> 01:38:54,194
♪ Everyone wants a slender waist ♪

827
01:39:06,742 --> 01:39:13,071
♪ If only your heart
could win over the waist ♪

828
01:39:27,478 --> 01:39:29,387
Fun, wasn't it?

829
01:39:29,782 --> 01:39:34,900
The song's over, so is the booze.

830
01:39:40,918 --> 01:39:42,827
You have a smoke...

831
01:39:47,286 --> 01:39:49,358
I'll get lots of booze.

832
01:40:00,118 --> 01:40:07,788
When you drop ash in this ashtray
you must know it's not the ashtray...

833
01:40:09,142 --> 01:40:11,444
- but me it's falling on.
- Oh yes!

834
01:40:26,998 --> 01:40:30,827
What are you staring at?
This way.

835
01:40:34,038 --> 01:40:36,591
This way... look here.

836
01:40:39,478 --> 01:40:41,201
What?

837
01:40:42,646 --> 01:40:46,956
What are you staring at
with your big...

838
01:40:50,198 --> 01:40:55,216
no, with your two small eyes.
What are you looking at?

839
01:41:16,022 --> 01:41:19,797
All I did was to look
at this little waist.

840
01:41:21,238 --> 01:41:25,548
Who do you think you are?
You're very beautiful?

841
01:41:26,678 --> 01:41:31,631
Your face is like a chameleon's,
a pencil-thin nose...

842
01:41:34,262 --> 01:41:37,077
and your body?
It's all right.

843
01:41:38,581 --> 01:41:41,877
Your waist is the only thing
one can look at.

844
01:41:42,358 --> 01:41:44,268
This little waist.

845
01:41:46,678 --> 01:41:51,467
Draped in a black sari,
that little area...

846
01:41:51,894 --> 01:41:57,742
is like a lemon.
No, lemons are yellow.

847
01:42:00,118 --> 01:42:04,591
In reds and yellows, if it's shown up
in a romantic light...

848
01:42:04,822 --> 01:42:07,789
naturally, I will look at it.
If you mind...

849
01:42:07,989 --> 01:42:10,226
you mustn't show it at all.

850
01:42:12,022 --> 01:42:16,048
Just as your face is a part
of your body, so is your waist.

851
01:42:16,438 --> 01:42:20,082
I look at your face, you don't mind.
I see the waist, you mind. What for?

852
01:42:20,598 --> 01:42:22,900
Tell me, darling. Speak.

853
01:42:24,565 --> 01:42:28,526
Not just your body, I'm going to
take a look at your whole body now.

854
01:42:34,198 --> 01:42:37,133
You have no right to
stand there before me!

855
01:43:36,438 --> 01:43:38,347
You have no right to touch it!

856
01:43:53,526 --> 01:43:55,763
I came here to discuss
something important with you.

857
01:43:56,182 --> 01:43:59,149
But neither are you in the mood to
listen, nor am I in the mood to tell.

858
01:44:08,118 --> 01:44:12,177
Khushi, I've done nothing.
It's my Bengali friend.

859
01:44:12,598 --> 01:44:14,507
He forced me to drink.

860
01:44:16,534 --> 01:44:20,079
If people smoke and drink,
why must I care?

861
01:44:20,725 --> 01:44:24,435
It isn't necessary for me
to know why you had liquor.

862
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:45,554
Want some?

863
01:44:48,278 --> 01:44:51,474
I came here because I thought
you were a nice human being.

864
01:44:51,958 --> 01:44:54,641
But you're worse than
I could ever imagine.

865
01:44:59,638 --> 01:45:01,231
If you'd listen...

866
01:45:45,878 --> 01:45:49,074
♪ You're a performer... ♪

867
01:45:49,749 --> 01:45:52,433
♪ you can't make me dance ♪

868
01:45:53,494 --> 01:45:56,755
♪ When it's your turn... ♪

869
01:45:57,238 --> 01:45:59,791
♪ you'll beat a hasty retreat ♪

870
01:46:03,094 --> 01:46:07,469
- Master, that's Altaf Raja's tune.
- Altaf Raja? A foreigner?

871
01:46:07,798 --> 01:46:11,627
He's a famous qawwal. This is
a tune from his famous album.

872
01:46:12,918 --> 01:46:14,827
- How's that possible?
- It is.

873
01:46:15,478 --> 01:46:18,347
You must've heard the tune
and pinched it

874
01:46:19,382 --> 01:46:23,473
- But this is a three-year old tune.
- What a thief!

875
01:46:24,118 --> 01:46:28,591
I composed the tune three days ago,
and he stole it three years back!

876
01:46:29,302 --> 01:46:31,091
No more qawwali for me!

877
01:46:43,702 --> 01:46:45,939
How did you know it's Priya
without even looking at her?

878
01:46:46,454 --> 01:46:51,375
The fragrance! I can tell every
beautiful girl from her fragrance.

879
01:46:52,918 --> 01:46:55,154
Where's this stink coming from?
Lay off!

880
01:47:01,622 --> 01:47:04,240
You like my wig, don't you?
Here you are.

881
01:47:14,198 --> 01:47:17,875
Remember, the cultural programme at
the college is fast approaching?

882
01:47:19,254 --> 01:47:22,287
Join Karan immediately
and start your rehearsals.

883
01:47:23,125 --> 01:47:24,718
- No, Master.
- Why?

884
01:47:25,558 --> 01:47:28,045
- I can't participate in this function.
- Why not?

885
01:47:28,758 --> 01:47:30,798
I've told you. I'm not participating.

886
01:47:37,078 --> 01:47:42,445
Mukesh, make a team of Karan and Roma
and send them on the stage.

887
01:47:42,838 --> 01:47:44,561
You have my blessings!

888
01:47:51,478 --> 01:47:55,307
- Who's Roma?
- You don't know Roma? Roma!

889
01:47:55,702 --> 01:47:59,532
A new student in the first year!
She's kicked up a storm in the college.

890
01:47:59,990 --> 01:48:04,333
The students are crazy about her
and go around her like blind men.

891
01:48:04,726 --> 01:48:05,587
What for?

892
01:48:29,010 --> 01:48:32,173
Could you help me cross the road?

893
01:48:42,118 --> 01:48:44,671
- You've crossed the road.
- Small road.

894
01:48:44,998 --> 01:48:47,551
- What?
- You've helped a blind man.

895
01:48:47,942 --> 01:48:50,430
Thank you so much.
You are large-hearted.

896
01:48:54,342 --> 01:48:56,578
Slipped out of my hands! Damn it!

897
01:49:08,198 --> 01:49:10,402
- What is the matter?
- Priya has sent a letter.

898
01:49:11,078 --> 01:49:12,988
- You can give it to Vicky.
- It's not for him.

899
01:49:13,158 --> 01:49:14,435
- Is it for me?
- No.

900
01:49:14,598 --> 01:49:15,939
- It must be for you then.
- No.

901
01:49:16,102 --> 01:49:18,273
- If not for me, you nor Vicky...
- It's for the two of us!

902
01:49:30,118 --> 01:49:32,027
You read it.

903
01:49:40,678 --> 01:49:42,849
I love Vicky so dearly...

904
01:49:43,238 --> 01:49:45,921
I don't think anyone in
the world loves anyone as much.

905
01:49:46,694 --> 01:49:51,233
You must think why every lover
in the world says that.

906
01:49:52,230 --> 01:49:54,564
It's because they have
true love for each other.

907
01:49:55,334 --> 01:49:59,163
And the suffering of separation
those truly in love go through...

908
01:49:59,558 --> 01:50:01,281
only I know about.

909
01:50:01,702 --> 01:50:06,274
I'm pining to meet Vicky.
Please bring us together.

910
01:50:08,262 --> 01:50:09,920
Yours, Priya.

911
01:50:11,078 --> 01:50:12,604
What are we to do now?

912
01:50:14,918 --> 01:50:17,187
Priya has a friend called
Shehnaz, right?

913
01:50:23,558 --> 01:50:25,248
- How are you, Rukhsana?
- I'm fine.

914
01:50:26,438 --> 01:50:27,899
Be careful, Vicky.

915
01:50:32,198 --> 01:50:34,499
The two of you chat,
I'm going to bed.

916
01:50:43,462 --> 01:50:45,371
Who's this girl?

917
01:50:45,638 --> 01:50:47,547
It's Shabana.
Shehnaz's friend.

918
01:50:58,118 --> 01:51:00,354
Is she coming here
for the first time?

919
01:51:01,382 --> 01:51:02,331
Yes.

920
01:51:04,038 --> 01:51:07,715
I see. Go ahead and
chat with Rukhsana...

921
01:51:08,486 --> 01:51:10,591
I'll take Shabana around the house.

922
01:51:11,045 --> 01:51:12,955
- Come on, Shabana.
- Run away, Vicky!

923
01:51:41,174 --> 01:51:43,629
Car number 906.
Is it yours?

924
01:51:44,054 --> 01:51:45,548
- Yes.
- Karan?

925
01:54:24,918 --> 01:54:26,827
Let me do it.

926
01:55:20,598 --> 01:55:23,467
- How are you related to the girl?
- I...

927
01:55:24,885 --> 01:55:28,017
- Help me with the injection.
- All right.

928
01:55:41,398 --> 01:55:42,675
In the waist.

929
01:55:46,518 --> 01:55:49,387
- Give it to her in the arm.
- This is meant for the waist.

930
01:55:49,558 --> 01:55:52,078
- No, give it to her in the arm.
- The one for the arm...

931
01:55:52,342 --> 01:55:55,790
is given in the arm, the one
for the waist is given in the waist.

932
01:55:58,581 --> 01:56:01,451
You don't know anything
about this waist, doctor.

933
01:56:01,942 --> 01:56:06,033
This waist has caused
a very big problem already.

934
01:56:06,678 --> 01:56:10,256
If I go into details,
it'll take at least 2 hours.

935
01:56:10,709 --> 01:56:13,197
Your duty hours will be over
and when the next doctor comes...

936
01:56:13,526 --> 01:56:16,909
I'll have to explain to him!
Have mercy on me...

937
01:56:17,238 --> 01:56:19,147
and give it to her in the arm.

938
01:56:24,918 --> 01:56:28,496
That's all right!
You can give it wherever you wish.

939
01:56:28,982 --> 01:56:32,277
Give it to anyone. To her,
the nurse or yourself...

940
01:56:32,982 --> 01:56:35,284
I've seen nothing,
I will see nothing.

941
01:56:36,885 --> 01:56:39,635
God, why did You make
this waist? Why?

What is it? What?

976
02:02:05,218 --> 02:02:07,607
I tried several times to
meet you at your office.

977
02:02:07,938 --> 02:02:10,491
But you staff wouldn't let me.
So...

978
02:02:12,290 --> 02:02:14,199
My name is Karan.

979
02:02:15,618 --> 02:02:18,487
Vicky's my friend, sir.
His past is nothing...

980
02:02:19,202 --> 02:02:22,136
at present, he's a student
and he has a very bright future.

981
02:02:22,498 --> 02:02:24,254
You don't know that,
but I do.

982
02:02:24,578 --> 02:02:27,611
At my age, my father was
even worse off than Vicky is.

983
02:02:29,058 --> 02:02:31,927
At this age, even you...
don't take offense.

984
02:02:32,418 --> 02:02:35,135
You used to be a small-time thug.

985
02:02:35,842 --> 02:02:38,078
But I tell you, at your age...

986
02:02:38,241 --> 02:02:41,537
Vicky will be far ahead of you,
me and even my father.

987
02:02:43,554 --> 02:02:46,336
Apart from all this,
he has a very kind heart.

988
02:02:49,218 --> 02:02:52,087
When a boy falls in love
with a girl...

989
02:02:53,122 --> 02:02:55,937
and he finds the girl
without any problem...

990
02:02:57,858 --> 02:03:02,397
imagine how happy it'll make him.
Please don't separate them.

991
02:03:03,042 --> 02:03:05,147
Please unite them.

992
02:03:13,218 --> 02:03:15,836
Your two minutes are up.
Let's go, Gotya.

993
02:03:19,746 --> 02:03:21,534
Did he have nothing to say?

994
02:03:21,858 --> 02:03:24,159
Your two minutes are up, he said.
And left.

995
02:03:28,578 --> 02:03:31,065
All right.
Even if he said nothing...

996
02:03:31,458 --> 02:03:34,589
couldn't you guess
what was on his mind?

997
02:03:34,914 --> 02:03:38,176
- What?
- I ask...

998
02:03:38,434 --> 02:03:41,052
couldn't you guess
what was on his mind?

999
02:03:43,362 --> 02:03:46,810
If one knew what's on everyone's mind,
there wouldn't be any problem at all.

1000
02:03:47,298 --> 02:03:49,437
We have these problems
because we don't know.

1001
02:03:49,698 --> 02:03:52,567
- What do you mean by these problems?
- These problems. Period.

1002
02:03:56,418 --> 02:03:58,654
All right. I must leave now.

1003
02:04:12,866 --> 02:04:14,655
Did you call?

1004
02:04:15,874 --> 02:04:16,986
Yes.

1005
02:04:17,218 --> 02:04:18,495
What for?

1006
02:04:20,770 --> 02:04:23,617
- To talk.
- That's what we've been doing.

1007
02:04:25,282 --> 02:04:27,649
No, there's something else
I want to talk about.

1008
02:04:33,282 --> 02:04:35,453
What is it about?

1009
02:04:37,858 --> 02:04:42,495
She knows... why must she
ask what it's about.

1010
02:04:43,586 --> 02:04:45,179
The arrogant one!

1011
02:04:49,602 --> 02:04:52,417
It's about what you think.

1012
02:04:55,042 --> 02:04:58,304
I'm thinking about nothing.
You wanted to talk to me.

1013
02:04:58,562 --> 02:05:00,471
So tell me what you want to.

1014
02:05:19,266 --> 02:05:21,852
- Is that what you called me to say?
- Yes.

1015
02:06:32,898 --> 02:06:35,319
Your intoxicating eyes...

1016
02:06:38,114 --> 02:06:40,253
your lips...

1017
02:06:46,194 --> 02:06:49,063
there's a huge list
I have of you.

1018
02:06:56,690 --> 02:07:00,367
Roma, can you fall in love with me?

1019
02:07:03,058 --> 02:07:04,967
Can you really like me?

1020
02:07:06,194 --> 02:07:07,852
However...

1021
02:07:09,778 --> 02:07:15,113
the possibility of me
falling in love with you...

1022
02:07:19,058 --> 02:07:22,255
- does exist.
- Thanks

1023
02:07:30,898 --> 02:07:35,371
I don't you well, you see.
Let's see each other for a few days...

1024
02:07:35,698 --> 02:07:38,567
and then I'll decide about it.
It'll take a bit of time, okay?

1025
02:07:39,858 --> 02:07:44,331
What's a bit... take all the time.
All my time is now yours.

1026
02:07:49,906 --> 02:07:53,288
I feel as if something is
stirred in my heart for you.

1027
02:07:54,898 --> 02:07:56,621
Your lovely tresses...

1028
02:07:58,066 --> 02:07:59,976
your rose-like lips...

1029
02:08:06,802 --> 02:08:08,712
and this lovely neck and...

1030
02:08:18,898 --> 02:08:23,851
I'm not calling you because
you have a girl in your arms.

1031
02:08:25,618 --> 02:08:29,993
Neither have I called you because
you're drawing pictures on her body.

1032
02:08:31,058 --> 02:08:33,295
I haven't called out
to disturb you.

1033
02:08:35,218 --> 02:08:39,047
We've got to be at Priya's place
at 7:30. You remember that?

1034
02:08:40,018 --> 02:08:47,372
- Karan, who's she? A friend?
- A friend? Oh no, no chance at all.

1035
02:08:48,466 --> 02:08:51,848
- Is she a lover then?
- Lover? How disgusting!

1036
02:08:53,266 --> 02:08:57,292
To be my lover,
a girl needs extra qualities.

1037
02:08:59,057 --> 02:09:00,880
So who's she?

1038
02:09:04,786 --> 02:09:09,772
She's Khushi. There's nothing else
I know about her.

1039
02:09:10,738 --> 02:09:15,145
Karan, just 15 minutes to go
for 7:30. May we leave now?

1040
02:09:21,682 --> 02:09:23,919
- When will you meet me again?
- Again?

1041
02:09:28,338 --> 02:09:32,494
- At lunch?
- Not lunch. At dinner.

1042
02:09:33,778 --> 02:09:39,855
At night. Candle-light.
Sunday 10, at my place.

1043
02:09:53,074 --> 02:09:54,350
Shall we?

1044
02:10:06,238 --> 02:10:08,988
Today's Sunday.
So?

1045
02:13:48,678 --> 02:13:50,914
It was you who said it...

1046
02:13:51,558 --> 02:13:53,729
Yes, I did, but...

1047
02:15:03,558 --> 02:15:06,045
Whoever you are with,
why must I care?

1048
02:15:20,838 --> 02:15:22,747
Sorry, I'm late.

1049
02:15:32,358 --> 02:15:36,929
- What happened?
- Last night... nothing.

1050
02:15:40,998 --> 02:15:44,642
- What did Priya have to say?
- She says forget it.

1051
02:15:45,637 --> 02:15:47,525
- Forget what?
- Love.

1052
02:15:47,782 --> 02:15:51,164
- Whose love?
- The love Vicky had for Priya.

1053
02:15:51,622 --> 02:15:53,477
Priya asks to forget it.

1054
02:15:57,318 --> 02:15:59,041
And what did you tell her?

1055
02:15:59,238 --> 02:16:01,725
When she herself isn't interested,
what can I do?

1056
02:16:02,150 --> 02:16:06,307
What is it with girls? Flirt when you
want to, dump the guy when you wish.

1057
02:16:07,142 --> 02:16:11,266
Have you girls ever considered
what it does to us guys?

1058
02:16:11,718 --> 02:16:13,441
You're acting like
a very decent guy?

1059
02:16:13,638 --> 02:16:15,939
Do you think I don't know
the truth about you?

1060
02:16:16,326 --> 02:16:19,195
Were you breathing heavily
last night, or weren't you?

1061
02:16:19,878 --> 02:16:20,609
What?

1062
02:16:21,350 --> 02:16:23,489
Were you breathing last night,
or weren't you?

1063
02:16:23,654 --> 02:16:28,356
Breathing? I was breathing last night
and the night before that too.

1064
02:16:28,742 --> 02:16:32,451
And I breathe every day...
and well at that.

1065
02:16:32,838 --> 02:16:35,391
It's good for the health.
Is it bad to breathe?

1066
02:16:35,718 --> 02:16:38,587
Maybe it's bad to look at this...
but why's it bad to breathe?

1067
02:16:39,110 --> 02:16:41,215
How will man live
if he doesn't breathe?

1068
02:16:41,478 --> 02:16:44,347
Am I the only one who breathes?
Everyone does. Every single day.

1069
02:16:44,742 --> 02:16:47,612
Your parents do, so do mine.
Because they breathe...

1070
02:16:47,878 --> 02:16:51,391
you are here, I am here...
so's the dog.

1071
02:16:52,038 --> 02:16:55,616
He breathes every day.
Nicely at that. Right puppy?

1072
02:16:56,838 --> 02:16:59,259
See? If you call that bad,
what can I do?

1073
02:17:00,165 --> 02:17:02,587
The breathing I spoke about is
different from the one you allude to.

1074
02:17:02,982 --> 02:17:06,244
It's all the same. If breathing
is wrong, everything is wrong.

1075
02:17:06,758 --> 02:17:08,285
I'll leave if you talk like this.

1076
02:17:13,158 --> 02:17:15,841
I know the suffering of one
truly in love.

1077
02:17:16,198 --> 02:17:19,547
Priya's words, weren't they?
So how can she ask us to forget it?

1078
02:17:19,878 --> 02:17:22,431
What does it mean?
We have to talk.

1079
02:17:32,710 --> 02:17:36,703
Today's the last day at college.
It's time to separate.

1080
02:17:37,158 --> 02:17:39,394
So come forth and take my blessings.

1081
02:17:55,698 --> 02:17:57,291
You been in a crowded train?

1082
02:18:02,001 --> 02:18:04,903
So many of them have
gone into coma for you.

1083
02:18:05,298 --> 02:18:09,902
I'm in a coma too. Embrace me
and revive me from the coma, Roma.

1084
02:18:16,178 --> 02:18:18,545
Priya's wedding has been fixed.

1085
02:18:29,298 --> 02:18:31,207
What are we to do?

1086
02:18:37,425 --> 02:18:38,374
Greetings.

1087
02:18:41,138 --> 02:18:43,047
Mr Zorawar Singh... over here.

1088
02:18:48,978 --> 02:18:51,367
Where are you going?
To fetch your daughter?

1089
02:18:52,338 --> 02:18:58,350
She's with us right now.
She's marrying the man she loves.

1090
02:19:27,538 --> 02:19:30,408
From the look of it, it appears
as if you want to give me a thrashing.

1091
02:19:32,946 --> 02:19:36,295
Don't even think of it.
Pray to God...

1092
02:19:37,074 --> 02:19:39,943
that I come to no harm.
If something happens to me...

1093
02:19:40,498 --> 02:19:43,596
you'll be the guilty one
in the eyes of the law.

1094
02:19:44,306 --> 02:19:46,673
I've made arrangements, you know.

1095
02:19:49,042 --> 02:19:51,857
You're picking up something
to throw at me.

1096
02:19:57,105 --> 02:20:00,172
Forget me...
you can't even touch my image.

1097
02:20:07,078 --> 02:20:10,013
Spend a month in Mahabaleshwar
before you return to Calcutta.

1098
02:20:10,758 --> 02:20:14,107
Dad has found a job for you
over there. Okay?

1099
02:20:15,398 --> 02:20:17,699
Spend your lives together.
Be happy.

1100
02:20:39,589 --> 02:20:44,575
There are problems between
you and Khushi, isn't it?

1101
02:20:47,558 --> 02:20:55,141
You know why man faces problems?
Because he hides his feelings.

1102
02:20:56,486 --> 02:20:59,355
If you speak your heart,
you face no problems.

1103
02:20:59,558 --> 02:21:01,467
But I don't know why man
doesn't understand that.

1104
02:21:02,086 --> 02:21:04,736
He loves someone,
but he pretends to hate her.

1105
02:21:04,998 --> 02:21:07,616
He hates someone and he pretends
to love her. What for?

1106
02:21:08,838 --> 02:21:14,337
Poor heart. Why do we burden
it with a thousand worries...

1107
02:21:14,918 --> 02:21:20,035
and make life unbearable for it?
If you love her...

1108
02:21:20,198 --> 02:21:22,915
tell her that you love her,
or tell her that you don't.

1109
02:21:25,478 --> 02:21:28,347
God has given you eyes to see,
ears to hear...

1110
02:21:29,638 --> 02:21:32,834
and a heart to love.

1111
02:21:34,758 --> 02:21:38,336
So forget about egoes
and fall in love.

1112
02:21:38,918 --> 02:21:40,259
Love each other.

1113
02:21:41,862 --> 02:21:45,310
I've told you how I feel.

1114
02:22:09,286 --> 02:22:12,766
You've been a great help in uniting
my friend with his beloved.

1115
02:22:20,678 --> 02:22:26,592
Thanks to you too. In uniting
my friend with her beloved...

1116
02:22:29,798 --> 02:22:34,020
you've been a great help.
Thank you.

1117
02:25:18,758 --> 02:25:20,099
This is Seema here.

1118
02:25:23,366 --> 02:25:25,471
- I'm leaving today.
- Okay.

1119
02:25:25,958 --> 02:25:30,268
- I'm leaving and you're just...
- I have another tension, Seema.

1120
02:25:52,358 --> 02:25:54,594
Sir, the taxi has arrived.

1121
02:26:15,398 --> 02:26:18,659
- Karan?
- He has left for VT Station.

1122
02:26:18,758 --> 02:26:20,962
- Which train is it?
- Howrah Mail at 7:15.

1123
02:26:27,302 --> 02:26:28,928
- Is Khushi there?
- She has left.

1124
02:26:28,998 --> 02:26:30,754
- Where to?
- Bombay Central.

1125
02:26:31,718 --> 02:26:34,587
- Which train?
- Golden Temple Express at 7:10.

1126
02:27:05,798 --> 02:27:08,002
- Karan?
- No one has arrived yet.

1127
02:27:52,358 --> 02:27:54,659
- Was there a girl called Khushi here?
- There's no one.

1128
02:28:27,526 --> 02:28:29,795
Maybe he has gone to
Mumbai Central to meet me.

1129
02:28:30,758 --> 02:28:33,278
Maybe she has gone to
VT Station to meet me.

1130
02:28:33,414 --> 02:28:34,592
And what if he hasn't?

1131
02:28:34,982 --> 02:28:35,931
Now?

1132
02:28:46,438 --> 02:28:51,294
A girl called Khushi will come here.
Please give her this letter.

1133
02:28:53,798 --> 02:28:57,311
A boy called Karan will come here.
Please give him this.

1134
02:30:38,086 --> 02:30:39,776
- Karan?
- Yes?

1135
02:30:43,558 --> 02:30:47,453
I've been wanting to tell you
something for a very long time.

1136
02:30:48,198 --> 02:30:51,296
You know?
I love you, Khushi.

1137
02:30:53,894 --> 02:30:56,676
When we were together,
this is what I wanted to say...

1138
02:30:56,902 --> 02:31:00,317
but I never could,
I don't know why.

1139
02:31:00,678 --> 02:31:04,027
And now that I want to speak,
you are not with me.

1140
02:31:04,230 --> 02:31:07,045
We said so much to each other
when we fought...

1141
02:31:07,238 --> 02:31:12,420
but we couldn't say one single word
to get together. I'm sorry, Khushi

1142
02:31:14,726 --> 02:31:18,174
When I freed my hand from yours
after thanking you...

1143
02:31:18,278 --> 02:31:20,667
I felt something strange
stir in my heart.

1144
02:31:20,902 --> 02:31:23,869
I don't know what it was.
But I need you, Karan.

1145
02:31:25,638 --> 02:31:31,388
I now realise that the fights
we had was all part of our love.

1146
02:31:33,158 --> 02:31:39,300
I need you, Khushi.
To love me, to fight with me.

1147
02:31:47,174 --> 02:31:50,076
You're a lucky girl to have
found a father like yours.

1148
02:31:50,246 --> 02:31:52,101
Ever since you agreed
to the wedding...

1149
02:31:52,166 --> 02:31:54,271
all he has done is to
look out for suitors.

1150
02:31:54,374 --> 02:31:58,497
He decided to have Lali married
the day she returned from the city.

1151
02:31:58,598 --> 02:32:01,315
Everything is ready.
The bridegroom, the garland...

1152
02:32:01,478 --> 02:32:04,260
step forward and be garlanded.

1153
02:32:15,398 --> 02:32:17,307
Lali! My child!

1154
02:32:18,278 --> 02:32:20,579
You're back! Welcome!

1155
02:32:20,774 --> 02:32:23,229
- Go and get ready quickly.
- But Papa...

1156
02:32:23,462 --> 02:32:27,292
Just don't worry, my little girl.
The boy I've chosen this time...

1157
02:32:27,878 --> 02:32:30,747
is neither running away
nor leaving behind letters...

1158
02:32:30,982 --> 02:32:33,633
and he's not in love with
another girl either

1159
02:32:34,726 --> 02:32:37,476
Why're you chanting Papa?
Go and get dressed quickly.

1160
02:32:37,798 --> 02:32:39,391
Coming!

1161
02:32:51,558 --> 02:32:53,795
Lali, take a look
at your bridegroom.

1162
02:32:55,366 --> 02:32:56,675
Take a look at him.

1163
02:33:14,918 --> 02:33:17,219
You left this note for him
in the train...

1164
02:33:17,798 --> 02:33:19,707
and he turned out to be
faster than you.

1165
02:33:20,006 --> 02:33:24,513
He halted the train and
took a flight to get here.

1166
02:33:24,774 --> 02:33:26,432
He has told me everything.

1167
02:33:26,598 --> 02:33:30,275
Karan's parents will also be
coming here for the wedding.

1168
02:33:30,406 --> 02:33:31,868
Are you happy now.

1169
02:34:41,798 --> 02:34:47,461
This is how two hearts met
and accepted each other.

1170
02:34:48,518 --> 02:34:52,260
They're celebrating their
ninth anniversary.

1171
02:34:52,838 --> 02:34:56,099
and they're still fighting
What is surprising is that.

1172
02:34:56,198 --> 02:35:00,900
they haven't one or two kids
they have 17 children in 8 years.

1173
02:35:01,766 --> 02:35:05,312
Twins every year But how
does it still add up to 17.

1174
02:35:05,798 --> 02:35:09,147
Confusing, isn't it.
They didn't fight for a year.

1175
02:35:09,286 --> 02:35:11,075
and they had triplets.

1176
02:35:13,222 --> 02:35:18,557
Khushi's expecting again.
Twins or triplets I don't know.

1177
02:35:18,982 --> 02:35:22,015
I'm just looking on
and praying for them.

1178
02:35:24,038 --> 02:35:27,780
May Karan keep giving Khushi
this happiness all her life.

1179
02:35:28,739 --> 02:35:32,000
