1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,321
Previously on Arrow:

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,000
These waters' powers,
they have permitted me...

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,924
...to live way beyond my time.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,601
I want you to take my place.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,210
I want you to become
the next Ra's al Ghul.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,523
If you insist on pursuing
this path of resistance...

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,121
...there will be consequences.
Is that a threat?

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,446
I'm the Demon's Head.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,726
Very soon...

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,805
...your brother...
He will never take your place.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,371
He Will.

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,126
Thea?

13
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,644
Thea? Oh, my God.

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,366
Thea.

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,170
I couldn't stop him.

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,806
I need an ambulance
at 455 Merced, Unit 10.

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,645
Please hurry.

18
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,080
All right. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

19
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,846
No, Thea, stay awake. Come on.

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,007
- Hang on. Almost there.
- How long was she like this?

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,601
- I don't know. I just found her.
- You need to stay here.

22
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,127
- I'm not gonna leave her.
- You need to let us work.

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,011
Get me a set of vitals.

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,406
Lift.

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,361
- Charge up to 200 joules.
- Charging.

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,367
Transfer lines.

27
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,488
- Clear.
- No response.

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,967
Draw up 1 milligram epi.
Charge to 200.

29
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,367
Charging. Ready.

30
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,891
Clear.

31
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,646
Asystole. No pulse.

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,491
- Start CPR.
- Yes, doctor.

33
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,128
- Pulse ox at 78.
- Come on.

34
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,567
Come on. Stay with us.

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,606
Come on.

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,007
Come on, come on.

37
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,761
We did the best we could
under the circumstances...

38
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,531
...but her injuries were extensive.

39
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,291
Even if she were to regain consciousness...

40
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,524
We can prolong her life
for as long as you wish...

41
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,001
...but it might be best
to consider other options.

42
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,202
I am truly sorry, Mr. Queen.

43
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,366
May I see her?

44
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,563
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,004
Oliver.

46
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,884
Thea.

47
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,280
What are they doing?

48
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,605
They're unloading the truck.

49
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,211
And, uh...

50
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,567
...having dinner.

51
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,048
General Shrieve is there.

52
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,131
The Alpha, the Omega.
He's combining them.

53
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,401
The bioweapon is armed.

54
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,331
- What happens now?
- He'll take it somewhere to be released.

55
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,051
Somewhere densely populated
where it'll have the most impact.

56
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,402
We need to stop that truck.

57
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,881
Where's Oliver?

58
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,403
- Come on.
- You stole a car?

59
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,045
I borrowed it. Come on.

60
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,130
Oh, my God.

61
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,930
Oliver.

62
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,561
Oliver, we came as soon as we could.
What happened?

63
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,727
Oliver?

64
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,641
They just left her there...

65
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,171
...to die.

66
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,767
Oliver, is she...?

67
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,770
It's bad.

68
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,404
What is it?

69
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,089
Smoke.

70
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,521
The League?

71
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,171
Screw them,
at least until we get our bearings, Oliver.

72
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,807
Come up with a plan.

73
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,371
He's won.

74
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,288
There is no plan.

75
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,929
Stay here with Thea.

76
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,165
Did you do this?

77
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,686
Did you do this?

78
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,606
You could still save her.

79
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,089
- I don't understand.
- Take your place as Heir to the Demon...

80
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,687
...and Ra's al Ghul
will bring your sister back.

81
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,968
- What's going on?
- Where are you going?

82
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,289
- Away.
- You can't just leave.

83
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,489
- Tell us what's happening.
- There's a way for me to save her.

84
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,767
Thea?

85
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,926
- Oliver, that's not possible.
- Yes, it is.

86
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,126
There are waters in Nanda Parbat.

87
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,484
They've permitted Ra's to live
for over a hundred years.

88
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,169
And in rare instances...

89
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,365
...told in legend, those waters have been
used to restore the dead to life.

90
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,045
He offered to use the Lazarus Pit on Thea,
didn't he?

91
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,967
Lazarus, as in from the Bible, Lazarus?

92
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,447
The pit's real. I've seen it.

93
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,367
It can save Thea.

94
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,000
Right. But only if you become the new Ra's.

95
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,011
Okay, well, even if a magic hot
tub were not crazy talk...

96
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,289
...we're not gonna let you join
the League of Psychotic Murderers...

97
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,808
...even if it is to save Thea.
Which this wouldn't.

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,162
The waters change a person.

99
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,051
In the soul.

100
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,641
Even if they work,
the Thea you get back...

101
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,365
...will not be the one you lost.

102
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,801
The one we lost because of you.

103
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,564
- Oliver.
- I'd prefer that we didn't do...

104
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,963
...our usual "please don't go" dance.
We not going to. I'm coming with you.

105
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,567
Assuming that this works...

106
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,286
...someone's going to need to bring Thea
back home.

107
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,324
We need a way to get to Nanda Parbat.

108
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,767
Sorry to interrupt.

109
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,441
Everything all right?

110
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,411
Because you got that crease
between your eyebrows...

111
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,921
...that tells me things most definitely
are not.

112
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,604
Something awful has happened.

113
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,809
And I need a favor.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,207
A really big favor.

115
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,688
Last time you asked for a big favor,
I had to loan you my helicopter.

116
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,042
I don't need your helicopter.

117
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,847
I need your jet.

118
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,727
Well, Oliver does. But both of us.

119
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,927
It's not what you think.

120
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,771
Well, if you're gonna fly away with him...

121
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,127
...then it's exactly what I think.
Ray.

122
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,967
Last night was a bit of an eye-opener.

123
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,927
Insofar as realizing something...

124
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,567
...you should have realized
a long time ago...

125
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,721
...could be considered eye-opening.

126
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,646
Last night,
when you were saying goodbye to Roy...

127
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,928
...you and Oliver...

128
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,002
You still have feelings for him.

129
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,003
When I...

130
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,404
...told you that I loved you
at the hospital...

131
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,324
...you responded with Jell-O.

132
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,811
Seeing you two together last night...

133
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,809
...I realized...

134
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,287
...you don't love me
because you're in love with him.

135
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,490
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,162
You're the last person
I ever meant to hurt.

137
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,369
Take the jet.

138
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,808
I hope the "something awful"...

139
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,201
...stops being awful.

140
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,450
What did Felicity say to Dr. Vaca?

141
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,206
She thinks Thea's being moved
to Central City.

142
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,966
You know, they do amazing things
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

143
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,404
Think about paying them a visit before
putting Thea on a flight to Nanda Parbat.

144
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,126
S.T.A.R. Labs can't save her.
Only the Lazarus Pit can.

145
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,890
Oliver.

146
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,044
Look, I know what I have done...

147
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,330
...doesn't seem like the actions
of a loving father, but I do love her.

148
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,443
She's the only child I have left.

149
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,725
Having said that...

150
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,407
...I would rather lose her forever
than subject her to the pit.

151
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,924
Get on the plane, Malcolm.

152
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,242
- You look chilly.
- Yeah.

153
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,811
Hm.

154
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,729
Thanks for letting me be here for you.

155
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,601
You're welcome.

156
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,049
- I didn't have much of a choice, did I?
- No.

157
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,410
I wanted to make you think
you had grown a little as a person.

158
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,602
I know that I've only told you a little...

159
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,603
...about the five years that I was away.

160
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,890
Well, if by a little,
you mean hardly anything.

161
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,646
I came back to Starling City...

162
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,006
...before they found me on the island.

163
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,369
I don't understand.

164
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,765
It was complicated.

165
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,649
I saw Thea.

166
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,445
She didn't see me.

167
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,762
She had a drug problem.

168
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,404
Sol...

169
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,529
...confronted her dealer.

170
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,281
And I broke his neck.

171
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,450
And I did it because I was angry. Sure.

172
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,240
But I also did it
because I felt like I was protecting her.

173
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,769
All I've ever wanted to do
was protect her.

174
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,683
Malcolm told me.

175
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,844
He warned me what Ra's might do.

176
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,851
But I never thought...

177
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,883
I failed.

178
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,847
- You got that?
- I got it.

179
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,527
Incoming.

180
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,961
Maseo, take the wheel.

181
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,602
You looked like you could use a hand.

182
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,809
It's not in here.

183
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,642
What is that?

184
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,327
It's the League.

185
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,920
Welcome home, Al Sah-him.

186
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,046
I must prepare her for the ritual.

187
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,808
I'll treat her as my own family.

188
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,051
I hope you find the accommodations
acceptable.

189
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,889
Such luxury is a small glimpse
of the life that awaits Oliver.

190
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,730
Trying to reassure me or yourself?

191
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,201
- I don't know what you mean.
- You're Oliver's friend.

192
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,046
Maseo, right?

193
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,926
I am Sarab.

194
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,642
Call yourself whatever you want.

195
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,731
If you gave a damn, you wouldn't work for
the man who practically killed his sister.

196
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,524
Oliver will be spared grief...

197
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,771
...in a manner that was denied to me.

198
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,844
And he will receive an honor
greater than you can imagine.

199
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,406
League of Assassins.

200
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,410
You're feared for your bravery...

201
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,570
...and power.

202
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,446
But all I see are a bunch of weak men
running from their lives.

203
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,602
Trying to escape.

204
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,202
That's not powerful, Maseo...

205
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,561
...or brave.

206
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,767
It's cowardly.

207
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,564
Do not presume to know me.

208
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,525
Until you've held your dying child
in your arms...

209
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,968
...until you've told him
everything would be okay...

210
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,842
...so that the last words he ever hears...

211
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,926
...are a lie...

212
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,890
...you know nothing.

213
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,404
I'm sorry.

214
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,449
What was your child's name?

215
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,120
Akio.

216
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,450
You think Akio would be proud
of his father right now?

217
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,370
Thea.

218
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,566
Thea.

219
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,882
I've fulfilled my end
of our arrangement.

220
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,687
I suggest
you begin to make peace with yours.

221
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,767
Hey. Hey. It's okay. You're okay.

222
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,725
I don't know you.

223
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,562
Thea, it's me.

224
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,127
- It's Ollie.
- Ollie's dead.

225
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,524
Dad?

226
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,768
I'm here, Thea. It's me.

227
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,803
What's going on?

228
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,560
Where am I?

229
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,171
Someplace safe.

230
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,405
You are safe.

231
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,090
Where's Mom?

232
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,091
Your mother's not here.

233
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,647
Look...

234
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,767
...just lie back, close your eyes,
and get some rest, okay?

235
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,564
I love you, Dad.

236
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,122
Ra's told me that the confusion would pass.

237
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,569
- You have no idea what you've done.
- What I've done?

238
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,927
She's alive, Malcolm.
What I did saved her life.

239
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,650
She thinks Moira's still alive.

240
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,529
- She'll be fine.
- You don't know that.

241
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,127
Yes, I do. Because you, Diggle
and Felicity are gonna take her home...

242
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,085
...and she will recover.
And what is that worth?

243
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,166
- Felicity...
- No, this is wrong. It is just wrong.

244
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,009
I need to talk to you.
What is happening here is perverse.

245
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,571
What you're doing to Oliver...

246
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,530
...what you're making him do,
I'm not going to let it happen.

247
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,528
You can leave us.

248
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,246
You have a great fire within you.

249
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,206
- I can see now why Oliver loves you.
- If you knew the first thing about love...

250
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,840
...you would not be ripping Oliver
away from his family.

251
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,122
I am merely helping him
fulfill his destiny.

252
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,130
Yeah, I know all about
the "survive my sword" prophecy.

253
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,051
And I'm here to tell you
that I could really give a crap.

254
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,327
Me, and John, and God help me, Malcolm,
are not gonna let this happen.

255
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,888
We have friends and resources
and we will go to war to get Oliver back.

256
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,251
You know, many lifetimes ago...

257
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,009
...I loved a woman immeasurably...

258
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,248
...and she loved me.

259
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,563
We had a son...

260
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,888
...and then a daughter...

261
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,446
...and for many years, I felt
I was the most fortunate man in the world.

262
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,081
My life was bliss.

263
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,721
And then one night a man came to my door
and he gave me a horrible choice.

264
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,804
To leave without saying a word to them...

265
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,404
...or to stand and watch them
tortured and then killed.

266
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,526
And I left without a farewell.

267
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,606
And to spare them pain...

268
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,250
...I endured an agony worse than death.

269
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,482
Sounds like you gave up too easily.

270
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,929
There's one immutable truth about life:

271
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,762
It is often more cruel than it is fair.

272
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,481
It rarely provides an opportunity
for any of us to find closure.

273
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,245
And all your posturing...

274
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,765
...and all your threats of war...

275
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,603
...they merely delay the inevitable...

276
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,691
...causing you to forfeit
the opportunity you have...

277
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,129
...which was denied me.

278
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,647
You need to tell Oliver goodbye.

279
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,243
Tell him how much you love him.

280
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,650
Tell him whatever it is
your heart needs to express.

281
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,329
And do it now...

282
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,647
...before he is lost to you forever.

283
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,331
Yeah?

284
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,684
- Hey.
- Hey.

285
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,686
You okay? I'm sorry,
that was a stupid question, you...

286
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,161
You just saw your sister
come back from being dead...

287
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,721
...and you're about to give up
everything you love...

288
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,008
...so you're probably not.

289
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,007
I remember the first time
that I thought I'd never see Thea again.

290
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,203
When my father's boat went down.

291
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,528
But you did see her again.

292
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,045
And you'll see her again...

293
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,166
...again.
This is different.

294
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,365
Just been thinking about the...

295
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,651
...person I was...

296
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,285
...the brother that I was...

297
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,165
...and how he probably died
when that boat went down.

298
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,285
All this time,
I've been struggling with who I am.

299
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,927
You think who you're supposed to be...

300
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,850
...is the next Ra's al Ghul?

301
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,729
Honestly?

302
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,331
I don't know.

303
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,528
The only thing I can know for sure
is that everything that I've done...

304
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,563
...everything that happened...

305
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,964
...it led me right here to this moment.

306
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,249
And, Felicity, if that's true...

307
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,722
...then I don't know what it was all for.

308
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,524
I do.

309
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,961
I wish that I could change your mind
about staying here...

310
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,924
...but I know I can't.

311
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,767
Just like I know how leaving you here
is going to destroy me.

312
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,610
I don't regret a single moment.

313
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,604
And you shouldn't either.

314
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,044
You have done so much.

315
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,648
You have saved so many people's lives.

316
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,281
And you have changed so many
for the better...

317
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,645
...including mine.

318
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,283
Knowing you has changed my life.

319
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,125
You opened up my heart...

320
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,285
...in a way I didn't
even know was possible.

321
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,888
I love you.

322
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,884
We searched the whole truck.
There's nothing in there.

323
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,046
Where is the bioweapon?

324
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,282
Don't make me ask again.

325
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,767
Food cart. It's in the food cart.

326
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,764
Where is the food cart?

327
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,764
We should split up to cover more ground.

328
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,570
What's wrong?
I know you don't think we should do this.

329
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,200
You decided
we should set an example for our son.

330
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,085
And for ourselves.
We can't just let people die.

331
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,245
If we do, we are just a shell.
Not really alive at all.

332
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,922
So that happened.

333
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,964
- I'm glad it did.
- Me too.

334
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,606
- Heh-heh.
- What's this?

335
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,122
If there's any kind of God...

336
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,763
...something alcoholic.

337
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,324
Not much to toast to up here, is there?

338
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,971
Oh.

339
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,649
There's us.

340
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,325
Yeah.

341
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,561
I'm sorry.

342
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,564
I know there's no way of avoiding this,
of getting out of here...

343
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,491
...of going someplace
where Ra's can't find us, but I...

344
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,569
Felicity...

345
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,483
Felicity.

346
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,843
What did you...?

347
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,570
I can't lose you.

348
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,810
I won't.

349
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,120
I stole some of the powder
that priest used on Thea.

350
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,851
I wasn't sure what I was gonna do
when I got it, but...

351
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,606
Yeah, how did you know
you were gonna lose your mind?

352
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,529
Or commit suicide.

353
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,688
Was your plan to sneak Ra's prize out
unconscious without getting us killed?

354
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,888
I know it's an insane idea,
but I couldn't do it.

355
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,685
I couldn't leave him.

356
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,886
- We have to get him out of here.
- Felicity, this place is like a fortress.

357
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,010
There's no way we're getting Oliver out
without Ra's knowing.

358
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,009
We can't. But you can.

359
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,682
- If we get caught, he'll kill all of us.
- Then we can't get caught.

360
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,364
I've seen enough movies to know that the
scary fortress always has a secret exit.

361
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,326
You were Ra's' right-hand stooge for years.
If anyone knows the way out, it's you.

362
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,763
- So don't even try to play games with me.
- The catacombs.

363
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,008
It's rough terrain.
It is not gonna be easy.

364
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,288
- How do we get there?
- Through the temple.

365
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,409
Go get Thea.
Meet us here in five minutes.

366
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,767
Go.

367
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,924
- Which way?
- Temple's this way. Come on.

368
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,321
- There's not much time. Hurry.
- Why are you helping us?

369
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,122
Because if I don't, then I am just a shell.
You reminded me of that.

370
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,565
Thirty meters down, the path forks.

371
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,087
- Take the left passage.
- Come on.

372
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,122
These tunnels are centuries old.
Stay close.

373
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,284
- You need to stop and rest for a minute?
- No.

374
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,727
Maseo said stay left.

375
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,362
- Thea?
- No.

376
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,482
- No, no. No.
- We have to move. Now.

377
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,642
Too late.

378
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,048
Believe me,
we do not want to be taken alive.

379
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,646
Hold.

380
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,369
I am Al Sah-him. Wah-reeth al Ghul...

381
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,285
...Heir to the Demon, and you will obey.

382
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,802
Put your weapons down.

383
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,330
Now.

384
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,569
Tell Ra's I will return shortly.

385
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,049
Oliver, please.

386
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,327
Thank you for trying.

387
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,085
I love you all the more for it.

388
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,365
But this only ends one way.

389
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,365
This is as far as I go.

390
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,369
- The jet's less than a mile away.
- Where are we gonna fly to?

391
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,170
I don't understand.

392
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,049
Malcolm is gonna take you home.

393
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,850
Aren't you coming with?

394
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,610
Not now.

395
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,211
You go on, I'll catch up.

396
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,891
I love you, Thea.

397
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,727
Don't ever forget that, okay?

398
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,049
Oliver...

399
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,088
Oliver, I don't know what to say.

400
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,329
I do.

401
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,922
John, you're the best man I've ever known.

402
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,604
Whatever happens...

403
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,842
...you're my brother.

404
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,611
I'm afraid I will never forgive myself
for leaving you here.

405
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,922
You told me once...

406
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,089
...that life is precious.

407
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,442
And that you wanted more
than I could offer you.

408
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,811
Don't give up on that.

409
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,364
The only way that I'm gonna survive this...

410
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,887
...is if I know that you're out there...

411
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,890
...living your life, happy.

412
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,523
We're always saying goodbye to each other.
You'd think I'd be good at it by now.

413
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,290
Well, let's not say goodbye this time.

414
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,361
What...? What's going on?

415
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,046
Everything's fine, Thea. You're okay.

416
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,165
If you're here, then I'm not.

417
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,561
At least you're feeling
more like yourself again.

418
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,245
What do you want?

419
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,887
Where's Ollie?

420
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,010
Thea, do you remember anything
about the past few days?

421
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,563
I... I was here.

422
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,009
And Ra's, he...

423
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,087
- He attacked me.
- No, Thea. He nearly killed you.

424
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,080
- Where is my brother?
- That is... That is what I'm trying to explain.

425
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,922
To save you, Oliver had to join the League.

426
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,764
- He... He traded his life for yours.
- No.

427
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,085
No.

428
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,127
I am sorry.

429
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,442
I know you hate me,
and you have every right...

430
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,927
...but I'm gonna make up for that,
for everything.

431
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,287
- That's not possible.
- Yes, it is.

432
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,246
The League isn't after us anymore.
I am free.

433
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,767
I could go anywhere in the world,
but this is where I want to be.

434
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,400
Here, with my daughter.

435
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,083
You took care of me when I was injured.
Now, please, Thea, please...

436
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,129
...let me take care of you.

437
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,049
Sorry to interrupt.

438
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,647
- Is everything all right?
- No, it's not.

439
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,443
- Felicity?
- Oliver's...

440
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,251
He's gone.

441
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,280
- What are you talking about?
- He joined the League.

442
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,369
He's not coming back.

443
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,885
Shh.

444
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,482
Blood has been shed. League blood.

445
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,484
And that is a transgression
punishable by death.

446
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,164
And yet you allowed your friends
safe passage home.

447
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,641
Tell me why
I should not hunt these people down...

448
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,683
...and stain my blade with their blood.

449
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,484
Because I stayed.

450
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,325
I'm honoring our agreement.

451
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,370
Now no one close to me
will ever be harmed again.

452
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,645
And your allies would not have been able
to escape through the catacombs...

453
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,844
...without assistance,
so you tell me who aided you...

454
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,729
...who this traitor is.

455
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,849
- I don't know.
- Me.

456
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,731
I struck down three of our number.

457
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,202
For my betrayal...

458
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,882
...I offer you my life.

459
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,449
You did not betray me tonight, Sarab.

460
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,126
Maseo Yamashiro did.

461
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,129
For a moment, your old life took hold...

462
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,887
...but by coming here and kneeling
before me, you have proven your loyalty.

463
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,562
And I will not spill Sarab's blood
for Mase0's actions.

464
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,410
Stand up.

465
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,920
Your service will be vital
in the coming weeks.

466
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,765
Oliver will need you for
his transformation.

467
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,250
And like Sarab...

468
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,765
...vestiges of your old
identity still remain.

469
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,920
Oliver Queen must be extinguished
from memory.

470
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,690
StOp!

471
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,606
Give me the vial.

472
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,767
The word "assassin" has fallen victim
to many abuses of language...

473
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,891
...its real meaning hidden
beneath a sediment...

474
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,010
...of lies and falsehoods.

475
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,762
In truth, "assassin"
comes from hashishiyya...

476
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,009
...which means
"those who stand apart from society."

477
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,530
Now...

478
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,004
...every man and woman in here
have renounced their past life...

479
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,647
...and forfeited their identity
in the name of something new.

480
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,727
And it is a cleansing
only achieved by fire.

481
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,370
Embrace the pain...

482
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:06,083
...for it is your soul
finally being unburdened.

483
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,601
Oliver Queen is dead...

484
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,404
...eventually to be reborn as Ra's al Ghul.

485
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,250
And for now, only the Arrow...

486
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,971
...Al Sah-him, shall remain.

487
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,242
Al Sah-him...

488
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,281
...Heir to the Demon.
