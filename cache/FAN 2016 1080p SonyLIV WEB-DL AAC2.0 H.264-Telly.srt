1
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,040
Connection is a strange thing!
Don't ask how it works

2
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,800
Our friendship goes back years

3
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,560
Our connection is stronger than
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth

4
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,040
The best actor award goes to
Aryan Khanna

5
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,880
First time I'm getting an award,
a major award in the film industry

6
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,480
This one's for you, Ma

7
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,240
Thank you very much

8
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,800
Before I could walk, I learned
how to jump like Aryan

9
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,040
Aryan? The moron!

10
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,680
Anyone insults him

11
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,840
I fight

12
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,000
If I copy his style...

13
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,960
...I get whacked

14
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,600
I don't think I've done enough work.
It's just been 5 years

15
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,120
I still have a long way to go
as an actor and star

16
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,480
I'll work hard and prove
I'm a genuine superstar

17
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,600
I never compare

18
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,480
What is better is to say you are the
best, not bother about others

19
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,280
You're the greatest.
But I'm better

20
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,640
Never met him. But I spend
all day with him

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,560
That's real connection

22
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,440
Whatever he does, I cut, copy,
paste, and ditto

23
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,400
Tiny difference

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,120
He became a star

25
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,520
And I became his fan

26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,840
And something else

27
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,200
We live together

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,960
In one cinema or the other

29
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,400
The real drama will start now!

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,360
None of my achievements
are my own

31
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,600
I am who I am today,
I am where I am today

32
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,120
It's all thanks to my fans

33
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,680
Without my fans, I'm nothing

34
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,480
Can't you even get 40% marks?

35
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,400
It's always Aryan, Aryan

36
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,040
My parents don't get it

37
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,000
He's not just a star,
he's my world

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,560
But God bowled a great googly

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,800
When God was making Aryan,
some clay was left behind...

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,280
...God made me with that

41
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,880
He and I are different.
Poles apart

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,880
But we are one

43
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,040
He is Aryan and me, Junior Aryan

44
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,200
I topped up your phone.
200 rupees

45
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,040
Send the money tomorrow

46
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,360
Don't worry

47
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,720
Tomorrow is fine

48
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,440
The shop is closing now

49
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,720
Check your phone

50
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,120
You're a gem. Bye, aunty

51
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,360
Batman, Superman!
Enough slaughter

52
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Shut down now. Kill the bad guys
tomorrow

53
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,680
- Gaurav, what's this?
- It's only 5.30, bro

54
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,200
Don't act smart. I told you.
You're out by 5.30

55
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,840
Go home, kids

56
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,320
Don't mess with me

57
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,240
All well?

58
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
Miss Call Center, where were you?
I'm closing

59
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,000
So early?

60
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,200
- I have a show
- 5 minutes. Please

61
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,600
No. I'll be late

62
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,320
Only 5 minutes

63
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,840
It's urgent

64
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,400
I need a recommendation letter
for my US visa

65
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,800
I have a costume trial

66
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,720
Can you do it later? Ok then

67
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,720
Thanks

68
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,480
5 minutes

69
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,160
You don't let us stay and for her...

70
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,960
Her work is urgent. You just
shoot partridges

71
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,720
I get what's urgent

72
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,920
Come back tomorrow

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,960
Get lost!

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,880
You losers

75
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,120
Sitting here dreaming of America
won't help you

76
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,840
But staring at Aryan's photo
will help you?

77
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,720
- Two minutes to go
- All done

78
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,960
Thank you

79
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,120
How much?

80
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,840
Forget it. Can't charge you
for 5 minutes

81
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,840
- Thanks
- Enjoy!

82
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,520
Brothers, the shop is closed

83
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,720
So the action just left?

84
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,680
What's 30 minutes?

85
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,920
I put this notice up a week ago

86
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,080
"Due to the grand Dussehra show

87
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,920
"Organised by the Resident Welfare
Assoc. Inder Vihar, DDA Colony

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,200
"AK Cyber Chat closes
at 5:30 sharp

89
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,680
"By order Gaurav Chandna,
proprietor AK Cyber Chat"

90
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,120
See you again

91
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,480
If I knew English well, I'd be
a computer myself

92
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,760
The shop won't stay open,
even for the Prime Minister

93
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,680
I said it's closed. You'll get
extra time tomorrow

94
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,680
You photocopy!

95
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,400
Don't be cruel like Ravan

96
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,800
This boy needs to watch porn.
He's upset

97
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,360
I don't heal upset minds
at Cyber Chat

98
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,400
No porn films allowed here anyway.
Out, you guys!

99
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,200
You better outgrow Aryan Khanna.
Sid Kapoor is the man now

100
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,840
Get smart, photocopy

101
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,320
The shop in Sector 28 is open

102
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,720
- Go there
- Don't you dare touch me!

103
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,000
- Don't touch
- Here, I'm touching

104
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,480
Get out of here

105
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,000
Let go! They need a lesson

106
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,160
Want to see porn? Huh...

107
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,080
What are you doing?

108
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,440
Nothing. I let you chat.
So they made trouble

109
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,760
I'm fine

110
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,520
You can all go. Thank you!

111
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,240
The jobless morons

112
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,240
They came to watch blue films.
I whacked them

113
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,560
Why play the hero?
Why didn't you call for help?

114
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,320
But I did call you

115
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,200
My heart did

116
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,000
So you came back

117
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,080
Please, Gaurav. Stop talking
like Aryan

118
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,800
Drop it. Coming to the show tonight?

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,480
Too much to do. I don't
have time like you

120
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,720
Today's a birthday special

121
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,600
No, thank you

122
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,600
Welcome

123
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,560
How did you get hurt?

124
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,360
Who hit you? I'll complain to
the association

125
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,720
It's fine. Don't ruin my concentration

126
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,800
Concentration? You can't move.
How will you go on stage?

127
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,880
The prize is 20,000. Cash!

128
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,840
You won't give me 20,000
to go and meet Aryan

129
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,400
My only chance to fulfill my dream

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,160
I don't have money to burn
on your silly dreams

131
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,320
What about your Tuesday trips
to the Hanuman temple?

132
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,360
Doesn't your 101-rupee donation
go up in smoke?

133
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,200
Hanumanji is a God.
And your Aryan...

134
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,080
He's important to me

135
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,080
Every fool has met him,
only I haven't

136
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,680
Spray some scent on me

137
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,920
- Careful
- If you can't do it, never mind

138
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,280
My fans are waiting. Get ready

139
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,600
Listen to your mother.
Stop your drama

140
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,240
The real drama starts now

141
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,480
Hold on to your hearts

142
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,920
You're about to see a performance...

143
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,160
...that the Western Union,
moving money for better...

144
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,600
...Super Star competition
can never do without

145
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
You guessed right

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,640
Here he comes.
The two-year winner:

147
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,120
Our Aryan Khanna Junior

148
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,360
Jindal aunty!

149
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,080
Your pressure cooker on the stove?

150
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,880
The only whistle you'll hear
today is right here

151
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,720
My hat trick year

152
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,720
Today I'll share something personal

153
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,520
About me and Aryan

154
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,600
I hide nothing from you

155
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,120
I'm no ace at romancing

156
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,480
But when I see her, my emotions
go haywire

157
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,520
Words escape me

158
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,840
Senior is an expert heart-stealer.
So I asked him...

159
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,240
...to help his Junior

160
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,160
It's delicate. I must tread carefully

161
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,840
Don't forget

162
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,600
The heart's job is to beat

163
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,600
When you count the night stars...

164
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,840
...and yearn to etch my name
on every star

165
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,640
You know you're in love

166
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,840
When you want to turn back
as you walk ahead

167
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,040
When you look for me
in a crowd

168
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,000
You know you're in love

169
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,520
If you don't believe me

170
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,160
Then hold my hand

171
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,920
If your heart stops, then you know...

172
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,120
...you're in love

173
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,760
I don't have your style, Senior

174
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,120
But if anyone insults you...

175
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,600
...I want to break their teeth

176
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,600
Mummy says, "Calm down"

177
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,080
"Aryan is India's sweetheart"

178
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,200
But he's a Delhi boy after all

179
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,920
Come, Senior. Let's show them
some Delhi muscle

180
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,160
Ma used to say: "Don't weigh
the food you're eating

181
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,280
"Don't count the guys you whack"

182
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,120
Here

183
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
Use this

184
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,400
I feel like just staring
at the screen

185
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
I have this dream

186
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,000
Keep doing your thing
with your heroines

187
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,480
I've been your fan forever

188
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,160
I think you owe me a dance

189
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,560
We'll have a blast

190
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,760
No one will tell who is Senior,
who is Junior. Hit it!

191
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,280
One last thing before I go

192
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,120
I am what I am today

193
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,000
I am where I am today

194
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,600
It's all thanks to my fans

195
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,280
Without my fans

196
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,200
I'm nothing

197
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,400
Brothers and sisters!

198
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,240
The Virat act did not impress us

199
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,120
The Katrina act did not impress

200
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,720
This year like every other year

201
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,760
The Western Union, moving money
for better...

202
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,600
Super Star competition's trophy
goes to our very own...

203
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,000
Gaurav Chandna

204
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,120
Give him a big hand!

205
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,160
I want to thank my Mummy

206
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,400
My Papa

207
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,400
My God

208
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,880
The greatest actor in the world

209
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,560
The Aryan Khanna

210
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,760
Ok, go

211
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,000
But why travel without a ticket?

212
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,320
- Go later
- Later?

213
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,480
Aryan's birthday is in 2 days.
And I must wait to book a ticket?

214
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,160
The ticket collector will catch you
and belt you

215
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,480
Remind her...

216
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,560
...how Aryan travelled to Mumbai
for the first time

217
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,600
- WT
- Without ticket!

218
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,200
You want to give him the trophy?
Courier it. Post it

219
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,520
Papa, count the cash again

220
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,200
Phony fans cheer him from afar

221
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,960
But I'll hug him and hand him
the trophy myself

222
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,440
- Like this
- Have you gone mad?

223
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,240
Control the boy

224
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,360
Here. 20,000

225
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,400
Is your spit on the notes?

226
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,800
Socks, in the outside pocket.
Underwear, inside the bag

227
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,280
Any extra underwear? I'll have
no time to wash them

228
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,080
Here. Give this to him from
your Papa and me

229
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
Sohan halwa

230
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,080
Tell him your father got it
especially for him

231
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,400
- From Chandni Chowk
- Why tell him? I'll show him

232
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,320
I'll show Aryan a family selfie.
Come, we'll get the background

233
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,440
Mummy, hold the box.
I'll hold the trophy

234
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,400
Papa, hide those undies

235
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,200
- Cheese
- Cheese!

236
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,320
- Shall I drop you at the station?
- No, you go to the shop

237
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,240
- Can you manage?
- Sure

238
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,680
Don't overstay at Aryan's

239
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,960
I've only four days leave.
Can't extend

240
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,880
Don't worry, Papa. By mummy

241
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,480
Be careful, son

242
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,360
Where to?

243
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,200
Hi!

244
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,080
Your parents throw you out?

245
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,560
Keep dreaming about moving
to America

246
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,200
I'm off to meet Aryan,
face-to-face

247
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,200
Told Aryan you're coming?

248
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,920
He's my Aryan, not America.
No visa needed

249
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,120
I'm going to America to make a new
life. You'll get zero meeting Aryan

250
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,360
Forget it, you won't understand

251
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,880
Hello, uncle

252
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,080
Hello, aunty

253
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,840
Your ice cream

254
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,120
One vegetarian meal

255
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,440
Seat number?

256
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,760
I'll get it

257
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,840
If you want to stretch your legs
or your back, tell me

258
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,560
It's only one night. We'll adjust

259
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,440
Allow me

260
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,240
Now it's ok

261
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,000
Let me put uncle's plate down.
Don't worry

262
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
We're coming

263
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,080
Without ticket?

264
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,920
Uncle, it's a long story

265
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,360
Let me explain

266
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,560
I'll do the explaining. Call
Ratlam police station

267
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,600
Let him spend two days inside.
No more WT travelling

268
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,240
Uncle, you don't get it. I could've
bought the ticket

269
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,520
- I want to travel without one
- Come along

270
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,160
I'm not a thief or a criminal

271
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,960
You see tomorrow is
Aryan Khanna's birthday

272
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,480
No point if I get there late

273
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,400
Aryan Khanna?

274
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,920
Right! He went to Mumbai WT

275
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,720
Stayed at Hotel Delite.
Room number 205

276
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,400
I'll be staying there too.
Get the picture?

277
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,400
Let me get to Mumbai.
You won't lose anything

278
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,320
Here's the ticket money. Keep it

279
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,960
- But I'll travel WT
- Shut up!

280
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,440
You need a tight slap

281
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,760
Take him. He won't listen

282
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,320
Damn you!

283
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,960
Take me to Mumbai. Or I'll jump

284
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,000
You'll be answering the cops
all night

285
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,960
Want to die? Get back inside

286
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,680
If I can't see Aryan Khanna
on his birthday...

287
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,400
...no point living

288
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,840
Don't lose your head over
these film stars

289
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,800
He may be a film star to you.
But he's special to me

290
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,600
Give me your hand or you'll die

291
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,280
- Take me to Mumbai
- OK! Give me your hand

292
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,800
- One veg meal?
- Done. Give me your hand

293
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,520
Ok, hold me

294
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,360
Is he a relative? Do you
really know him?

295
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,920
Is he family? What are you
to Aryan Khanna?

296
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,280
A fan

297
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,280
Room 205 is occupied

298
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,800
Why? I've booked it

299
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,680
No bookings here

300
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,120
First come, first serve.
Pay cash, take the key

301
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,960
I'll pay double

302
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,800
But only room 205

303
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,320
If you don't give it to me,
just see what I'll do

304
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,840
Hey boy! Move the stuff from 205
to 209

305
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,600
Here, brother. Room 205 for you

306
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,240
Happy birthday, Senior

307
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,480
Let me pass, brother. I'm late.
Move it!

308
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,720
What a crowd! By God

309
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,800
Brother, move aside

310
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,600
The press over there

311
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,040
Let them come in

312
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,800
A selfie! Smile

313
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,880
Thank you

314
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,680
These two-faced fans

315
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,320
They moan about his films

316
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,320
And come here to pose with him

317
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,320
You can't go there

318
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,200
I'm not one of them. Those FB types.
Phony fans

319
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,440
I'm Gaurav Chandna

320
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,960
I've come from Delhi. WT.
Rajdhani Express

321
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,080
Guess where I'm staying?

322
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,560
Guess!

323
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,040
Hotel Delite. Room number 205

324
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,880
Don't you get it?

325
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,240
I'll show you magic

326
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,160
You'll enjoy it. Look!

327
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,840
When you count the night stars...

328
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,480
...and yearn to etch her name
on every star

329
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,400
You know you're in love

330
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,320
When her breath is carried
by the breeze...

331
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,360
Lets go press

332
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,080
You know you're in love

333
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,840
When you turn back as you walk ahead

334
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,240
Check the press IDs

335
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,880
Go inside

336
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,600
Not you! Don't you get it?

337
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,440
I want to show him my trophy

338
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,440
I just want him to see it.
Then I'll be gone

339
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,240
Moron!

340
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,680
If Aryan ever hears that
you hit me...

341
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,680
...he'll thrash you

342
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,200
It's ok. It's nothing

343
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,120
Mummy sent you special halwa

344
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,720
And this trophy...your birthday.
Mummy sent special halwa

345
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,560
Yes, Mummy?

346
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,520
I'm fine

347
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,320
Aryan is fine, too

348
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,000
I haven't met him yet. You're talking
like a child, Mummy

349
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,600
He's a superstar. How can
I just meet him?

350
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,400
There are thousands of people
here to meet him

351
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,040
They've built a 50 ft wall
in front of him

352
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,000
The poor guy is stuck alone behind it

353
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,280
Scream as hard as you want,
he can't hear

354
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,120
I'm hanging up. I'll call later

355
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,280
They say common sense deserts
a man in bad times

356
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,960
Seems that's Aryan Khanna's
fate now

357
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,720
In his twilight years, his films
are bombing

358
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,080
No surprise that he's on edge
and snappy

359
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,920
On his 48th birthday, he showed
his irritation...

360
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,440
...through his gift to Sid Kapoor

361
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,880
No star has matched Aryan till now

362
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,960
But Sid Kapoor...

363
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,640
...has pulled the rug
from under his feet

364
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,920
The party guests said...

365
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,200
Sid Kapoor just hinted that...

366
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,760
...Aryan Khanna's days were over

367
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,360
What did Kapoor tell Aryan Khanna...

368
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,640
...that made him hit Sid Kapoor?

369
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,760
I went to wish him happy birthday

370
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,360
Look what he did to me!
Totally out of order

371
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,440
He's an elder. I respect him a lot

372
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,960
I always say I've learned how
to act by watching his films

373
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,200
I don't know why I make him
insecure

374
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,640
What will you do?
Take legal action?

375
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,000
I should

376
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,280
I'll talk to my legal team

377
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,920
Let's see what they say.
It's my duty to do something

378
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,280
So no newcomer is mistreated
by a senior star

379
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,600
That's all I want to say

380
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,640
We'll talk after I've consulted
my legal team

381
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,600
Liar! Cheat

382
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,480
Playing the good boy on TV.
Anyone can see through you

383
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,640
You think he's insecure?

384
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,720
He's seen off dozens like you

385
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,080
No one has touched Aryan Khanna
for 25 years

386
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,960
Do your worst, sonny!

387
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,120
No one can touch him

388
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,680
Just you wait

389
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,360
Cut it!

390
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,680
Great shot

391
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,000
Superb!

392
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,760
- Liked it?
- Fantastic

393
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,560
Sid Kapoor! You swallowed
Aryan Khanna whole

394
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,840
What dialogue delivery!

395
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,480
You've destroyed Aryan Khanna.
Blew him away

396
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,120
I am your biggest fan, sir

397
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,280
At the contest back home...

398
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,280
It's my bad luck I look like Aryan,
but I always impersonate you

399
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,720
I win, sir

400
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,560
I've even won a trophy.
I love you, sir

401
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,400
Let me show you my trophy, sir.
Please...

402
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,280
- You let the girls through
- Let him come

403
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,880
Sir says yes

404
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,000
Sorry. Give me space

405
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,960
I'll show you my act?

406
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,760
Ok

407
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,360
The mind always outsmarts
the face, Mr. Singhania

408
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,760
You can ape someone

409
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,640
But you can't ape his mind

410
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,080
When all doors are shut

411
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,680
There's a knock at mind's door

412
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,240
And when that door opens,
you see a new road

413
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,560
I have walked that road to you,
Singhania

414
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,200
And through that very door
you shall walk to your peril

415
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,280
You're too good, fan

416
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,840
Well done, man

417
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,400
Relax man, calm down

418
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,800
I have the same jacket you're wearing

419
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,560
That's good. Very nice

420
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,560
- Sir's lunch break now
- One chance, sir

421
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,000
Santosh, bring me the salad
in half an hour

422
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,640
And this fan, come on!

423
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,280
Hear that?

424
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,840
- Sit down
- No, thank you

425
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,160
Sir, a small suggestion from a fan

426
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,880
Why fight with Aryan Khanna?

427
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,760
Why bother with the police
and police reports?

428
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,400
That's nothing, bro

429
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,400
I'll drag him to court

430
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,880
Allow me

431
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,240
Time's up for Aryan Khanna

432
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,000
- I'll wring your neck
- Santosh!

433
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,080
To hell with Santosh

434
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,960
Shut up! No one is coming

435
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,360
Close your mouth

436
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,440
Now listen... sit quietly...

437
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,560
Don't open your mouth again
to insult Aryan. One peep and...

438
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,400
I'll crush your chocolate face
with the wrapper

439
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,720
No fan will look at you again

440
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,880
Spouting pearls of wisdom on TV.
Look at my camera

441
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,320
Read! Here's the script.
Learn the lines

442
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,400
Do your rubbish acting

443
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,640
Your damn phone never
stops ringing

444
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,240
Now I'll see

445
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,400
Read it!

446
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,720
Start

447
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
It's in Hindi, dude

448
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,160
You're a Hindi film hero
and you can't read Hindi?

449
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,640
Where do they find you guys?

450
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,600
What do you film people say?

451
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,760
Action!

452
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,040
Dear Aryan sir

453
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,280
I'm really very sorry

454
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,080
My statement to the press
was all lies

455
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,400
I wanted to spoil your name

456
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,960
No one can take your place.
You're the best

457
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,120
The greatest, the most evergreen
super-duper star

458
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,400
I apologise again

459
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,240
Think of me as your kid brother
and forgive me

460
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,160
Why won't he play with you?
Shall I tell him to?

461
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,040
Dad, he bullies me

462
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,480
He bullies you because
he's scared of you

463
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,040
He thinks you'll win. We'll cheat!

464
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,400
- Dhruv, let's play
- Dad, come on

465
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,240
Play with Isha. I've trained her

466
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,000
- I am so sorry
- Dad, you made me lose a point

467
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,200
Now she's ahead of you.
Try and win from her

468
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,320
I'm glad Sid realised his mistake.
He's a great guy. Young and new

469
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,200
Glad it got sorted

470
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,800
Ladies and gentlemen,
last point, next point

471
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,120
Nothing is sorted, it's a game

472
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,280
Apology, say sorry - it's all a game

473
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,560
You should've controlled yourself

474
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,880
I tried very hard

475
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,000
I gave him one slap. More a pat

476
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,560
See the scandal it's created

477
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,880
If someone comes to my house,
drinks my expensive wine

478
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,000
Flirts with my wife. Must I just
stand by and watch?

479
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,480
You have no time

480
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,600
Let someone else flirt with me

481
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,160
Actually you're right

482
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,640
But not this moron

483
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,240
The video has gone viral.
Social media is abuzz

484
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,200
Join us for the stock market news
after this short break

485
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,640
Aryan, wake up!

486
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,680
What happened?

487
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,480
Did you sleep here all night?

488
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,400
I was reading a script. It was
so good that I dozed off

489
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,560
Sunaina is here. She has something
to wake you up with

490
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,880
Good morning, Aryan

491
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,200
It's too early, Sunaina

492
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,240
I know. I'm really sorry.
I have to tell you something

493
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,240
- Are you pregnant?
- Shut up, Aryan

494
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,760
See this

495
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,840
Come on. Look here and say
your lines. Hurry

496
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,760
Dear Aryan sir

497
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,640
Look here. Look at the camera

498
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,160
Ok. I'll do it

499
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,040
- Come on
- Did Aryan send you?

500
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,600
Aryan has nothing to do with it.
Do as you're told. The camera

501
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,600
If you want cash, take it.
Just let me go

502
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,800
Cash? I'll give you cash

503
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,760
Stop! I'll do it

504
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,480
What will you do? Scum!

505
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,920
A fan

506
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,760
Calls himself Junior Aryan Khanna

507
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,760
He sent a message

508
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,360
"A small birthday gift to the love
of my life, Senior Aryan Khanna

509
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,000
Call me once to thank me.
My life will be set"

510
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,440
Hello

511
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,080
Junior Aryan Khanna?

512
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,360
You calling from Aryan's house?

513
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,800
Yes

514
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,160
Where is Senior? Aryan Khanna?

515
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,720
He's busy right now. He asked me
to call you

516
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,200
How come he's so busy?
No time to talk to his Junior?

517
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,440
I did so much for him

518
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,800
I came to the house on his birthday,
The crowd...

519
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,400
Yeah, yeah, hello

520
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,680
Aryan...

521
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,640
Aryan Khanna?

522
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,160
Gaurav this side.
Your fan, your Junior

523
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,160
Where are you?

524
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,920
Just guess

525
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,680
Delite hotel, in your room

526
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,600
Room no. 205. Charni Road.
Remember?

527
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,840
But if you're calling to say
thank you, it won't do

528
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,360
I deserve a hug from my brother

529
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,840
- You want to see me?
- Sure

530
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,280
I made a big scandal just to meet you

531
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,200
Wait there. I'll send a car to
pick you up

532
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,440
Done, Senior

533
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,440
Thank you!

534
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,520
Mind blasting

535
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,920
Really?

536
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,280
Go by taxi

537
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,120
You're going to Aryan Khanna's.
Don't go by auto-rickshaw

538
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,080
He's sending me his personal car

539
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,680
He's invited me home

540
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,920
Don't forget to take pictures

541
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,120
If he offers you any food, no
pouncing on it like a pauper

542
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,560
Food? I'm not going for the food.
I'm going there to hug him

543
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,840
Tell him to wear the clothes I had
made for him at Diwali

544
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,120
- Make sure he takes the trophy
- As though he wouldn't

545
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,960
- Say hello from me
- And me, too

546
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,040
Ok. I'll tell him

547
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,560
Phone me once you've met him

548
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,320
The car's here. Call you later

549
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,880
The car is there

550
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,680
Hello

551
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,040
Are you the driver?

552
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,040
Junior Aryan Khanna?

553
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,640
- Did you act smart with Sid Kapoor?
- No

554
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,520
You're mistaken

555
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,200
Did Sid Kapoor send you?

556
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,280
I'll tell you later. Come

557
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,440
I'm meeting Aryan.
I won't go anywhere

558
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,560
- Like hell you won't
- I won't come

559
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,960
Don't touch me

560
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,520
No touching

561
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,800
Let me go!

562
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,240
Stop!

563
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,120
Try catching me!

564
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,400
- Stop! You rascal
- Please don't hit me

565
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,280
Don't hit hard. We have orders

566
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,040
Let's go

567
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,320
Let me call Aryan Khanna

568
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,080
Where are you taking me?

569
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,480
Sid Kapoor is evil. Don't get
mixed up with him

570
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,720
Shut up!

571
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,360
I did it for Aryan Khanna.
His problem is my problem

572
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,200
If Aryan hears about this...

573
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,080
...he'll skin you alive

574
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,080
Stop!

575
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,920
Think carefully. We'll be back.
Let's go

576
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,000
Good evening, sir. Come in

577
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,960
We asked him why he made the video

578
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,480
He says he'll talk only to you

579
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,680
You told us to go easy on him

580
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,240
- Hardly touched him
- Thank you

581
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,520
- Usman
- Yes, sir?

582
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,120
This is for his expenses

583
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,800
Keep him here for 2 days

584
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,200
Get him a ticket to Delhi.
Take him to the station

585
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,080
As I said, don't beat him up
too badly

586
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,840
Just enough to scare him

587
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,200
No one must hear about this

588
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,720
No police record, no video statement.
Please

589
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,040
Sure, sir

590
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,040
Where is he?

591
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,320
I want to meet him alone

592
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,160
- You stay here
- Yeah

593
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,680
Gaurav

594
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,080
Senior

595
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,560
You're here

596
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,880
I knew you'd come

597
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,040
They hit me and hit me

598
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,440
They broke my bones

599
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,200
I protected my face

600
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,600
It's Aryan Khanna's face.
Nothing must happen to it

601
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,320
See? Same to same

602
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,800
Everyone calls me Junior
Aryan Khanna. But I say...

603
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,600
...there's only one Aryan Khanna

604
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,000
Relax

605
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,280
It's ok

606
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,280
I impersonate you at the yearly
Super Star competition

607
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,960
Always win first prize

608
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,560
The bastards took my bag.
My trophy was in it

609
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,520
I brought it to show you

610
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,320
I could show you my act

611
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,320
I'm nervous in front of you

612
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,800
It's all right. Sit

613
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,360
No audience here. Their screaming
and cheering helps

614
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,360
- Are you from Delhi?
- West Delhi

615
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,440
You're from Rajender Nagar,
I'm from Inder Vihar

616
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,320
Two traffic lights from the TV tower.
Near DAV Park

617
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,760
Listen carefully

618
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,160
You did something nasty

619
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,680
It's a crime

620
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,480
A crime in the eyes of the law.
Love in your eyes, no?

621
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,120
Not love, it's stupidity

622
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,920
Do you have family?

623
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,280
There's Papa, Mummy

624
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,240
And you, too

625
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,360
Have you thought what
your parents would say?

626
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,160
They'd be sad seeing you
in that sadistic video

627
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,520
Why would we show it to them?
It was for you

628
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,560
Did you like my birthday gift?

629
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,040
Sid Kapoor? I beat the crap
out of him

630
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:16,360
I don't understand how the cops
discovered our little secret

631
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,640
Our?

632
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,080
There is no "our" between
you and me

633
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,920
The police brought you here
on my orders

634
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,960
You made a mistake. You
had to be punished

635
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,480
So you won't mess up again

636
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,520
On your orders? I did so much for you

637
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,520
Who are you to do anything
for me?

638
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,840
I'm your fan

639
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,960
- You're my star
- Fan? So you do as you please?

640
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,160
Thrash people? Murder?

641
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,600
If need be, I could murder for you

642
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,880
You're not my fan

643
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,120
Don't say that

644
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,840
I risked my life to meet you

645
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,720
I hit Sid Kapoor a little, so you'd
meet me. What did I want...

646
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,920
...in return?

647
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,720
To see you, a few photos,
an autograph. That's all

648
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,040
- Can't you spare 5 min of your life?
- It's my life

649
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,760
Why must I give you even
five seconds?

650
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,640
I am who I am today,
where I am today

651
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,320
My stardom

652
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,640
It's all thanks to my fans

653
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,000
If it weren't for my fans...

654
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,560
I'd be nothing

655
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,280
Gaurav makes Aryan

656
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,520
Without Gaurav...

657
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,960
...Aryan is nothing

658
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,200
Now you listen carefully

659
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,960
When the police let you go,
go straight to Delhi, get it?

660
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,040
I'll forget all about Gaurav

661
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,760
And you forget you ever met Aryan

662
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,200
Stay in your life.
I stay in mine

663
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,760
This is your final warning. Ok

664
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,080
Forget it

665
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,200
You won't understand

666
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:24,880
Yes, Mummy

667
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,320
I'll be home soon

668
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,000
Everything ok?

669
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,040
Everything is fine

670
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,360
Why didn't you take my call?

671
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,920
I was busy

672
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,320
Gaurav, we're worried about you

673
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,240
Don't worry

674
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,840
You'll come home soon?

675
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,760
Tell Papa to mind the Cyber Cafe

676
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,840
Are you eating properly?

677
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,800
The food is fine here

678
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,920
Thank you

679
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,440
Come, hero. Sir wants you

680
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:51,200
Whatever happened has happened.
Put it behind you. Right?

681
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,240
Thank you, brother. I made
a mistake. Sorry

682
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,200
Gaurav!

683
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,960
Did you hug Aryan Khanna?

684
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,600
Didn't he meet you?
Didn't spare 5 minutes?

685
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,600
Don't you feel bad

686
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,560
It's not my loss. It's his

687
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,360
He's happy where he is.
I'm happy where I am

688
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,560
Mummy, make me some
rice and beans tonight

689
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,680
Hello, aunty

690
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,560
You're moving out?

691
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,160
Who knows what this boy wants

692
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,320
Got a good price?

693
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,120
Don't worry, Papa. I'll invest wisely

694
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,720
Too much time wasted on Aryan

695
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,520
The shop is sold, Mummy.
Let's go

696
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,440
Hurry. You coming?

697
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,080
- Let's go
- Ok, come

698
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,120
All well, aunty?

699
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,480
Fans chase stars

700
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,880
Now a star will chase a fan

701
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,480
Whenever Aryan Khanna's name
is taken...

702
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,640
...it'll be in the same breath
as Gaurav Chandna

703
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,640
1 Year later

704
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,760
Welcome to Bollywood Caf*.
98.1 FM

705
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,520
Do you know what's special
about the weekend?

706
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,920
Guys, this weekend...

707
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,080
...is the Aryan Khanna reloaded
show presented by Hyundai

708
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,840
Stars have a great life

709
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,040
I want a life like Aryan's

710
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,280
Full on, jet setter!

711
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,560
One day in London, Dubrovnik the next

712
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,480
For the grand Bhutiani wedding

713
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,240
Then back to the London show

714
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,000
Wow!

715
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,320
Do you know London is
one of his favourite places?

716
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,160
In fact he considers it his
second home after Mumbai

717
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:34,880
We have some good news
and some bad news

718
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,520
The bad news first, obviously

719
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,320
The Hyundai Aryan Khanna reloaded
show is houseful

720
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,440
Oh no! What's the good news?

721
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,520
We have 20 free tickets
for our listeners

722
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,360
Who ever is the first to answer
my question correctly...

723
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,480
...wins a free show ticket

724
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,840
My question follows straight after
this beautiful song

725
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,680
Here's your tickets. Enjoy your visit

726
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,760
- How can I help you?
- One ticket please

727
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,720
Enjoy your visit

728
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,440
The real drama starts now

729
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,360
Aryan Khanna!

730
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,360
Mr. Khanna, Tim Baker,
the Manager

731
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,360
Aryan Khanna, the actor

732
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,200
I hope it's not a bother

733
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,400
Fans never bother

734
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,400
Sir, a photo with your wax figure

735
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,360
Let me say this. It's amazing

736
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,760
You've come all the way to London...

737
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,720
...to take a photo with
my wax figure

738
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,000
Really, that's very sweet.
Is this better?

739
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,480
Better now?

740
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,120
Let me warn you

741
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,600
I was much younger then

742
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,800
You like it?

743
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:00,880
Honestly...

744
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,600
...it's very scary

745
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,000
So, does he look like me?

746
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,840
- You look great in real life
- Exactly, darling

747
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,920
I agree. What a fat nose he has

748
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,400
My nose is tiny

749
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,320
A phony face

750
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,960
A fake smile

751
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,440
All phony

752
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,560
I don't smile like this

753
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,040
Actually no one smiles like this

754
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:31,880
His hair smells bad.
Feels bad, looks bad

755
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,000
In fact, I don't look like him at all

756
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,280
This is a fake

757
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,280
Aryan Khanna is a fake

758
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,120
I want a refund. Aryan Khanna
is a fake

759
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,560
This isn't right. You can't do this
to our property

760
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:53,200
The white man claims
my face is his property

761
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,160
Mr. Property Agent. This is me

762
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,280
My face, my property

763
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,640
- Stop now and leave, sir
- I won't leave

764
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,440
It's a joke. You guys can't
take a joke

765
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,160
Come here. Come

766
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,720
Who can stop me?

767
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,280
I'll shoot you all

768
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,520
I don't understand what
you're talking about

769
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,840
You are gonna be in a lot
of trouble over this

770
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:23,600
Really?

771
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,200
You are in trouble too

772
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,840
Stay out of my way! I'll shoot

773
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,320
You alright?

774
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,320
Aryan...

775
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:31,200
What?

776
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,440
Come out

777
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,760
What are you saying?

778
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,280
Arrest warrant for you

779
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,520
What the hell is this?

780
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,640
I didn't go to Madame Tussauds

781
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,280
- The Indian Ambassador on line
- I'm not talking to any Ambassador

782
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,080
I'm here to arrest him

783
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,240
Sir, Mr. Khanna did not go to
Madame Tussauds...

784
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,120
Are you Mr. Khanna?

785
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,400
Then just shut up and let me
do my job

786
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,480
Excuse me. So you are doing
your job and we are faffing?

787
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:03,000
Must say you have a very polite way
of talking to women, Mr. Duncan

788
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,240
Guess what?

789
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,360
It's my turn to be polite now

790
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,160
This, sir, is nonsense

791
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,360
Where were you between
10 and 10.30 this morning?

792
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,920
- I was at home
- And who were you with?

793
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:16,680
I was alone

794
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,840
Did anyone see you at home?

795
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,280
I just told you I was alone

796
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,080
Aryan, I'll call our lawyer

797
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,200
Can you talk in a language
we all can understand?

798
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,840
Let me translate it in a language
you understand

799
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,440
Lawyer

800
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,040
Two options

801
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:36,240
Handcuffs if you are nasty,
without handcuffs if you are nice

802
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,560
Nasty

803
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,520
Just five minutes

804
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,720
You stay here

805
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,240
Just five minutes sir, please

806
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,280
Let's call Akhtar

807
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:45,800
What happened?

808
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,120
Lost your funny bone?

809
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:50,960
That's not me

810
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,200
Behaves like you

811
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,760
Looks like you

812
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,640
Everybody calls this person
by your name

813
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,120
I said that's not me

814
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,040
You have any proof?

815
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,280
Say something, Mr. Superstar

816
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,240
Not to you, Mr. Small-Time cop

817
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,400
Not a word without my lawyer

818
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,440
Suit yourself

819
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,400
24 hrs remand for Mr. Khanna

820
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,400
Till he comes out with the truth

821
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,360
- You can't do that
- Sure, I can

822
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,280
Sir, one photograph please?

823
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,880
- You have a safe trip, sir
- Yeah, I will be

824
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:52,760
It's time. Lets go

825
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,280
DUBROVNIK

826
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,040
In Croatian, we say - How are you?

827
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,040
I'm fine

828
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,360
My name is Gaurav

829
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,200
Thank you

830
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,560
Vegetable sandwich... one

831
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,120
Which one do you want?

832
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,240
This one?

833
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,920
Ok. Here we go

834
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,200
No, no, more. Six more

835
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,800
It's ok. Here

836
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,200
Thank you

837
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:55,840
Thanks

838
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,200
It's only bail

839
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,800
We know you're lying

840
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,960
Why would I waste my lies on you?

841
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,720
That was no imposter.
You twisted psycho

842
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,600
We'll have you back
in jail in no time

843
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,120
Please do that

844
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,040
Maybe I'll earn some money suing you
and the entire British police

845
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,000
Aryan, control your temper

846
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,280
It's their city, their country

847
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,960
Don't make matters worse
for yourself

848
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,000
So we're done with all
the formalities?

849
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:54,600
Thanks a lot

850
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:56,880
Pathetic fool

851
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:01,160
I'm coming with you to Dubrovnik
in case of any immigration problem

852
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,120
Hey! Not that way

853
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,400
The press is outside

854
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,680
Aryan, this is Deputy High
Commissioner, Mr. Murthy

855
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,520
Pleased to meet you

856
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,480
Sorry you had to go through
all this but...

857
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,480
We can't interfere very much

858
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,320
This is a foreign country after all

859
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,000
I know. Rules in every country
are made to get the innocent

860
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:24,200
Sir, we're diplomats, not detectives

861
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,960
Before the case is solved, we have
permission for you to travel

862
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,760
Now we can only do that much

863
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,280
It's a serious matter.
A diplomatic issue

864
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:35,720
So you must prove it wasn't you
at Madame Tussauds

865
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,840
Must I prove it? Ok, I'll play cop

866
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,640
I really appreciate your help

867
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:42,960
Thank you

868
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,440
Thank you, sir

869
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,480
In jail or dancing at a wedding...

870
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,640
...these stars are so arrogant

871
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:57,360
Your home CCTV footage has saved us.
It's with the police

872
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:01,320
It proves an impostor was at Madame
Tussauds and you were at home

873
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,320
Who is he? What's his motive

874
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,840
Forget the London cops

875
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,880
Find out. We need to get this guy

876
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,480
We'll know more back in London

877
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,000
So you know you can
really relax now

878
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,720
Wine? Champagne? Anything?

879
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:15,920
Everything

880
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,760
Come on, Aryan. It's over now

881
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,920
Sir, a call

882
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,040
He says he knows the imposter
at Madame Tussauds

883
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,320
- Give me the phone. I'll talk
- He'll only talk to sir

884
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,800
He won't give me his name

885
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:29,920
Give it to me

886
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,240
Hello

887
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:44,520
Senior

888
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:50,720
Chandna?

889
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,640
I won't let you forget my name

890
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,240
It'll be taken in the same breath
as your name

891
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:57,720
What do you want?

892
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,440
The stage is set

893
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,680
Tell everyone - admit what you did
was wrong

894
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:06,360
You'll never break a fan's heart
again. Say sorry

895
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:09,080
Stop this nonsense! I'm not
apologising to anyone

896
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,960
I tried to make you see sense

897
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,760
If you had agreed to give me
5 minutes

898
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,120
I would have my life.
You would have yours

899
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,920
But you had to prove you had
star power

900
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,560
Now you'll see a fan's power

901
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:22,560
I'm a star

902
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:26,520
I took your pranks as childishness.
Threw you inside for only 2 days

903
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,480
If I knew the real you,
you'd still be inside

904
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:32,800
In 48 hours you snatched away
my devotion of 25 years

905
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,440
If you don't say sorry...

906
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,280
...in the next 48 hours,
your stardom is over

907
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:39,920
Do what you want

908
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,160
I've seen off dozens like you

909
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:46,960
The higher you fly, the harder
I'll make you fall

910
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:51,360
But you must fly as high as me,
Gaurav Chandna

911
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,040
Impossible for you

912
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:58,200
We'll see how far you get
impersonating me

913
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,840
I don't need to go far

914
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,200
You're getting closer to me.
In Dubrovnik

915
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,680
Idiot. He's in Dubrovnik

916
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,720
Unknown caller, unknown location

917
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,520
Obviously, Sunaina. He won't
call from a traceable number

918
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,920
Say sorry. It's no big deal

919
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,080
He's mad

920
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:32,600
Is that so? And what am I?

921
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,240
Is the make-up team in place?

922
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,840
They are on there way

923
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:43,280
Oh great. The props, fireworks,
confetti all that

924
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,520
We've done a couple of rehearsals.
Everything's perfect

925
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,760
Ok. Thank you

926
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,000
Aryan asked for a background
check of all the staff members

927
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,760
- Is it done yet?
- It's going on right now

928
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,960
Ok. Thank you

929
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:57,840
Nicksi Jelopera

930
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,480
- Medium?
- Medium size

931
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:58,880
You're so late, Aryan Khanna.
It's just not done

932
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,520
I apologise. I'm extremely sorry,
Mr. Bhutiani

933
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,200
I had a crisis, I'm sorry

934
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:06,080
You celebrities always have
some crisis

935
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,480
But my daughter doesn't
get married everyday

936
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,600
- I know. I'm sorry
- You've no idea

937
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:14,560
That stunt you pulled in London has
caused me great loss of face

938
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,840
No, Mr. Bhutiani

939
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,160
What happened at Madame Tussauds...

940
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,360
You know what? I'll make
it up to you

941
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,840
I swear. Your guests will always think
of the grand Bhutiani wedding

942
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,320
They better do

943
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,360
After all I'm spending
a bomb on you

944
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,680
Only you can. I'll get ready

945
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,720
Sunaina, find out where
the CCTV cameras are

946
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:41,320
Usman, watch the guest areas,
the bars, the toilets, the corridors

947
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,520
- Keep an eye on everyone
- Excuse me, sir

948
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,000
I'm really sorry to interrupt but
we just have 2 minutes

949
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,840
I don't need two, darling.
Let's go, I'm ready

950
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,600
Good luck

951
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,440
Payal, tell me the names

952
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,800
Is Bhutiani's son-in-law called
Amul Mirchandani?

953
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,200
It's Anmol Mirchandani

954
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,200
Guys, all the best. Break
a leg and do well

955
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,480
And sisters Anushka, Deepshika?

956
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,840
That's for later, it's all here

957
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,840
Second entry dance 5,6,7,8.
You're giving it to me

958
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,600
- Sir, your shades
- Thank you, Payal

959
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,680
Ok guys. You have 30 seconds
to go

960
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,400
All the best, just kill it

961
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,440
Check all entries and exits

962
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:57,640
Ok, Sunaina

963
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:10,800
Find anything?

964
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:14,560
Not yet, sir. I've spoken to the team,
no one enters without an invite

965
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,160
Sir, your cue cards

966
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,200
15 secs to go

967
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:19,760
Can you go to cam 4

968
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,040
When you count the night stars...

969
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,600
...and yearn to etch her name
on every star

970
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,440
You know you're in love

971
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,640
When you want to turn back
as you walk ahead

972
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:36,600
When you look for her in a crowd,
you know you're in love

973
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,000
"Say sorry"

974
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,640
Check the crew's photos

975
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,160
He's not a guest. He's crew.
Quick

976
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,040
Got it

977
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:53,840
Sorry

978
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:07,520
There. Zoom in

979
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,920
Check the crew backstage

980
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:11,760
Copy

981
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:15,480
Payal, we need the crew ids.
Photographs and bio-datas

982
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:18,880
- Anything serious, sir?
- Aryan wants to know

983
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:31,880
Sorry

984
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:32,800
It's fine

985
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,560
The crew is local

986
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,600
Except one guy. Half Indian,
half Croatian

987
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,200
Akhtar is sending you a photo
of him

988
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,760
Keep a close eye

989
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:52,800
Round up all the crew

990
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,840
- Any sign of him?
- Sir, nothing

991
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,360
He's not responding

992
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:26,520
Sunaina

993
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,040
Can't see him on any camera

994
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,960
- But I'm at it
- What are you at it?

995
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,040
Where is there no CCTV camera?

996
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,080
Your make-up room

997
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:49,600
Careful, sir

998
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,840
"Gaurav makes Aryan"

999
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:23,040
You're very stubborn.
You don't listen to me

1000
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,480
Why are you hiding?
Talk face-to-face

1001
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,080
I stand face-to-face, Aryan Khanna

1002
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:31,960
But you never see me

1003
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:36,320
Now when I'm not there, you're
longing to see me

1004
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,720
I know the feeling

1005
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,000
I felt it among the crowd
in front of your house

1006
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:52,160
Sir, the Bhutianis are waiting.
The audience interaction...

1007
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,000
Yeah. I'm coming

1008
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,440
- I'll take care of it
- Thank you

1009
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:02,080
I'll come back and see you.
Hi sweetheart

1010
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:03,760
Hope you enjoyed the show

1011
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,760
- Aryan, it was marvelous
- Thank you

1012
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,320
That's my daughter

1013
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,640
She's been practicing a step to
dance with you for two months

1014
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,840
Actually we were both practicing

1015
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,320
How pretty is she

1016
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,320
You know what? Let me start
with the young one

1017
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,120
...and I'll come back
for the experience

1018
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,640
We've found Chandna

1019
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,000
In the corridor, across from where
you're dancing

1020
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:47,680
I'm not dancing

1021
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:49,840
Chandna is on the dance floor

1022
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,440
What the hell is wrong with him?

1023
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:43,360
I was dancing. He started touching me
here, there, everywhere

1024
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,400
I don't know. You'll have
to do something

1025
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,640
- Get him out
- I don't care

1026
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,400
What the hell are you doing?

1027
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:00,600
Mr. Bhutiani?

1028
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,840
- Where do you think you are?
- Calm down, Mr. Bhutiani

1029
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,160
- What happened?
- That girl is like my daughter

1030
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,600
Is this how you film stars behave?

1031
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:11,000
I'm really sorry, ladies.
I'm sorry

1032
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:14,280
I'll explain. The guy who was
here wasn't me

1033
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,080
- Nonsense
- It was somebody else

1034
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:17,400
I'm Aryan Khanna

1035
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,520
- I'm Aryan Khanna
- What nonsense!

1036
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,080
You known me for years

1037
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,920
I love you guys. I'd never
harm you people

1038
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:26,000
That person wasn't me

1039
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,040
I suggest you leave

1040
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,680
Keep back!

1041
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:54,720
Stop the car!

1042
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,520
No one has given me the
interaction script

1043
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:09,640
15 minutes to show time.
Is there a delay?

1044
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:14,840
What?

1045
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:22,800
The show's cancelled

1046
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:28,200
They've boycotted the show

1047
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,680
Sponsors have also pulled out

1048
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:36,560
Nobody came, not a soul

1049
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:46,040
Whats wrong with you?

1050
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:46,840
You wimp

1051
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,200
Watch where you're going?

1052
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,320
Media playing up the story

1053
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,160
The wedding video has gone viral

1054
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:23,880
"Given Khanna's status, he must
take responsibility for his actions

1055
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:25,600
"Is he attention-seeking?

1056
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:28,360
"Movie stars forget that one day
they'll be has-beens

1057
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:31,080
"Stars must go through traumas.
Look at what his done

1058
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,440
"It's a crime if an ordinary man
misbehaves...

1059
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,320
"...if it's a star - it's a stunt.
Why these double standards...

1060
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,840
"...for stars? A criminal is
a criminal"

1061
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:48,560
Hello

1062
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:51,840
Hello, sir. It's me, Aryan.
I'm calling from London

1063
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:55,000
I know you are in London,
but what's going on?

1064
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:59,080
A Delhi boy is impersonating me,
committing crimes

1065
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:00,840
We have to arrest him

1066
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,920
But the crimes are committed
outside of India

1067
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,280
We can't arrest him. It's not
in our jurisdiction

1068
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,880
Must we wait till he commits
a crime in India?

1069
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,320
His name is Gaurav Chandna

1070
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:15,080
Find me his Delhi address.
It will help

1071
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:17,400
You don't teach me my job

1072
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:21,400
But who shall we arrest?
You're the accused, Aryan

1073
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:23,440
I just...

1074
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,440
Come back to India

1075
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:29,240
Then we'll look into the matter with
the proper procedure. OK?

1076
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,280
Hello

1077
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:36,680
What did he say?

1078
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:41,480
Organise a press conference
first thing tomorrow

1079
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,520
- In Mumbai?
- No, here in London

1080
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:53,160
You now have the video footage
and all the documents, etc

1081
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,560
You have proof...

1082
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:59,760
...that Aryan Khanna did not
commit these crimes

1083
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:12,320
You're angry with me, and you
have the right to be

1084
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,480
But believe me

1085
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:18,000
That dangerous and evil face
you see on TV is not me

1086
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:19,840
That person is not me

1087
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:21,120
So please give me time

1088
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:24,840
Time, so that I can prove
I've done nothing wrong

1089
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,640
I'd never do anything that
would make you ashamed...

1090
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,160
...to call me your star

1091
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,120
Whatever I am...

1092
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:40,880
I just want to say, I would
never do anything like this

1093
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:42,720
Thank you

1094
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:48,600
Sir, do you know this impostor?
Have you met him?

1095
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:52,880
Sorry. We can't talk now.
The case is under trial

1096
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,320
What about the imposter's name?

1097
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,280
As soon as we have proof,
you'll be the first to know

1098
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:00,960
Are you the real Aryan Khanna
or the imposter?

1099
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,880
You find this funny? A big joke?

1100
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:11,560
If this happened to a girl in your
family would you still be grinning?

1101
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:16,480
A woman was molested and
you find it's funny?

1102
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,040
And one more thing

1103
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:22,800
This press meet is not
to prove my innocence

1104
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:25,320
I want to warn you all

1105
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:29,320
The man who's impersonating me,
spoiling my name

1106
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:32,320
He can hurt anyone, anytime

1107
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:34,160
So please be careful

1108
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:37,800
Thank you everybody.
Thanks for coming

1109
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:40,120
Aryan has a flight to catch, he's
going back to India

1110
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:41,880
So have a great day and
see you soon

1111
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:44,600
MUMBAI

1112
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:58,720
Don't stop, go from behind

1113
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:09,120
Open up!

1114
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:14,240
One minute, sir. Madam said we must
inform her

1115
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:15,640
Good. Hurry up

1116
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,920
Before the journalists outside mob me

1117
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:23,520
Hello

1118
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:25,480
Ma'am, can sir come in?

1119
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:29,960
No, wait a second

1120
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,760
- Are you sure it's him?
- It sounds like sir

1121
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,240
Ask him to face the camera

1122
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:40,720
Sir, ma'am wants you to step forward

1123
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:49,840
Hi, I am Aryan Khanna. Height 5'10.
Black hair, black eyes

1124
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:51,360
A big nose

1125
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,560
School: Kendriya Vidyalaya,
New Delhi

01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,280
Give me the phone, quick!

1128
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,440
The press will surround me

1129
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,360
Let me in. Or I'll end up
in their arms

1130
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:07,680
Why is your phone off?

1131
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:10,560
Can I tell you inside?

1132
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:14,360
Open the door

1133
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,360
Guys. Dad's here

1134
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:53,160
Aryan, you're back?

1135
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:06,760
- Hi
- Hi

1136
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:09,680
- You're back
- Yes, I'm back

1137
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,920
Are the kids asleep?

1138
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:20,360
Yes. It's way past their bedtime

1139
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:22,360
Of course

1140
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,480
Let them sleep

1141
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:29,440
Let's relax and talk quietly
in our room

1142
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:34,600
Yes

1143
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:44,600
- What an entrance exam!
- You passed with flying colours

1144
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:47,240
I spent my life preparing
for this moment

1145
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:50,120
Relax. Make yourself a drink.
I'll run the shower for you

1146
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:51,720
Of course

1147
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:09,960
She was crying. Not easy getting
her to sleep again

1148
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:17,960
It's better for us both if Isha
stays asleep

1149
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:25,320
I did say...

1150
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,560
...we could talk calmly

1151
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:31,800
Why do you need that?

1152
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:33,360
Give

1153
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:37,640
I have nothing against you
or your children

1154
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:40,160
Give me that

1155
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:44,640
Senior ignores me

1156
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:47,600
You can't let him do that

1157
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:53,480
Show me Aryan's study, he's
always talking about it

1158
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:58,000
Sound asleep

1159
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:00,400
Come, come

1160
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:11,000
Sit. He lands in 20 minutes.
I haven't much time

1161
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:13,120
Come on, sit down

1162
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:19,960
This room has so many stories

1163
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,400
Many stories behind these awards

1164
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:27,080
In these costumes

1165
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:31,120
Days that Aryan does not want
to forget

1166
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,360
Memories he wants to keep close
to his heart

1167
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:43,600
I treasured his memories too

1168
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,480
Kept them right here

1169
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:53,880
At home, on the walls of my room,
in cupboards

1170
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:56,120
On shelves like these

1171
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:08,400
Aryan Khanna filled every corner
of my life

1172
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:11,520
But he ended it all

1173
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:15,320
Five minutes! I asked him for
only five minutes

1174
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:18,440
Know what he said?
"It's my life

1175
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:20,240
Why must I give you even
five seconds of it?"

1176
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:27,960
- I apologise on his behalf
- Why should you apologise?

1177
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,360
I hit Sid Kapoor for his sake

1178
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:33,680
He was hassling Aryan

1179
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:37,160
What did Aryan do? Threw me in jail.
Had me beaten

1180
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:42,840
Said: "It's a crime!" A crime?

1181
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:46,120
Crime is what I'll do now

1182
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:51,840
Breaking hearts of fans who are
devoted to you...

1183
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:54,120
...is a crime too

1184
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:59,040
You tell me

1185
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:01,840
Am I so wrong?

1186
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:06,520
When he fights with you,
doesn't he say sorry?

1187
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,840
So, why can't he say sorry to me?
Tell me!

1188
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:14,280
Don't do this. I beg you

1189
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:16,120
What do you mean "please"?

1190
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,560
He left nothing for me. Why must
I leave anything for him?

1191
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:21,880
How can I? Impossible

1192
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:24,840
A sham. All lies

1193
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:28,280
Liar. He's a fake

1194
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,120
The rascal acts all the time

1195
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:33,840
An actor after all

1196
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:44,120
I wanted to give him my trophy

1197
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:51,400
A belated happy birthday,
Aryan Khanna

1198
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:13,400
Open the door!

1199
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:32,600
I sent the children to my parents

1200
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:37,120
They were terrified. I didn't know
what to tell them

1201
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:41,120
Isha asked me repeatedly: "Why did
Papa destroy the study?

1202
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:43,560
Don't worry. It's ok

1203
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:46,960
- Why don't we call the police?
- The police will do nothing

1204
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,960
They'll ask for proof. They believe
I'm the criminal

1205
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:53,760
I came this far in life
on my own steam

1206
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:56,800
I'll handle it myself

1207
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:02,160
Play rough like a street hoodlum

1208
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:05,080
I'll rip him apart. Send him back
to where he belongs

1209
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:09,720
Gaurav Chandna has seen my star face

1210
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,960
Now he'll see my real face

1211
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:15,680
I'm a Delhi man too

1212
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:20,720
The dangerous and evil face
on the news is not me

1213
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:23,440
That person is not me.
Give me time

1214
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:25,560
I'll prove I've done nothing wrong

1215
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:29,360
I'd never do anything to make you
ashamed calling me your star

1216
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,880
Aryan Khanna's press conference
proves that he is innocent

1217
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:36,640
A criminal is impersonating him
and committing crimes

1218
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:40,240
Who is the culprit? His name?
His whereabouts?

1219
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:43,840
No one knows the motives
behind his terrible actions

1220
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:50,080
The police have informed us that
they're very hopeful...

1221
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:53,040
...this criminal will not escape them

1222
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:56,000
When he's arrested, he'll be
severely punished

1223
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,080
Hello, Gauru

1224
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:22,080
Mummy

1225
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:25,240
What's wrong with your phone?
Where are you, Gauru?

1226
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:26,320
Right here

1227
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:27,840
I'm ok

1228
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:30,440
And you?

1229
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:33,720
Son, come home soon.
We're in trouble

1230
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:40,120
You've roamed the world, now return
to your home

1231
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:44,800
Aryan?

1232
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:47,840
You barged into my home?

1233
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:51,640
You can barge into mine, can't I
do the same?

1234
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:56,080
I came here to grab your
parents by the throat

1235
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:58,280
To ask why they produced
a nasty son like you

1236
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:02,120
- But I am not a lowlife like you
- Don't drag my parents into this

1237
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:04,040
They did nothing

1238
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:06,120
What did my kids do?

1239
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:09,960
I went alone into your fortress.
Did you bring an army?

1240
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:11,800
I am here alone, Gaurav Chandna

1241
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:15,760
No security, no secretary.
No star, no hero

1242
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:18,520
If you have the guts, face me

1243
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:19,840
Settle the score

1244
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,240
The score will only be settled
when you apologise

1245
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:28,320
Get on the stage at the Inder Vihar
contest and say sorry

1246
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:29,280
And listen...

1247
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:32,560
If you touch my parents with
a feather even...

1248
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:37,000
I know your mother-in-law's house,
where your children are hiding

1249
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:39,840
Your daughter is very cute, by God

1250
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:45,920
- Your son is stubborn like you
- You rascal

1251
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:50,080
I'll bury you in a gutter here, if you
dream of harming my kids

1252
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:55,240
What will my parents think?

1253
01:46:57,240 --> 01:46:58,240
Such a big star...

1254
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:01,840
...with such a foul tongue

1255
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:05,600
Forget it

1256
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:09,760
See you at the contest

1257
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:13,440
Your son has lost his mind

1258
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,440
- He's crossed the line
- Our Gaurav was not like that

1259
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:20,160
He was a good boy

1260
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:23,080
He changed after meeting you

1261
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:26,680
What would you have lost
if you gave him 5 mins?

1262
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:28,640
Don't blame Aryan

1263
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:30,200
It's our fault

1264
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:34,720
We let him get obsessed by
your glamorous life

1265
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:38,720
Not your hard slog. He would've
followed your example

1266
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:42,360
Worked hard and become someone

1267
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:47,200
Then the call center girl could've
become his girlfriend or wife

1268
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:51,520
He has a girlfriend?

1269
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:55,680
A one-way romance.
Gaurav loves her but...

1270
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:59,320
Enough. We have to accept things
the way they are

1271
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:03,840
- Where's the contest held?
- The other end of the colony

1272
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:07,640
Apologise. End this terrible situation

1273
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,280
You think I'm wrong too?

1274
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,800
And I must apologise?

1275
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:12,520
Arrest him

1276
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:16,560
He must be punished

1277
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:21,920
Imprison him for years, if you must

1278
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:27,240
But don't beat him

1279
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:29,240
Please

1280
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:35,080
Hey Junior. Where were you?

1281
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:37,720
- Hello Uncle, Aunty
- Hello

1282
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:40,560
Have you been watching the
news on TV about Aryan?

1283
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:42,640
Never mind

1284
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:45,280
I have good news for you all

1285
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:47,320
I've got my American visa

1286
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:48,840
I knew it

1287
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:54,040
Why is he standing with his back
to me? It's not like him

1288
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:58,440
He's going on stage soon,
he's just nervous

1289
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:00,000
Him? And nervous?

1290
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:03,240
Has he done anything in life
besides copying Aryan?

1291
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:06,800
Hey Superstar, your make-up...

1292
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:16,080
Neha

1293
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:21,400
I have to talk to you

1294
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:26,200
Super surprise!

1295
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:29,640
Western Union - moving money
for better

1296
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,400
Now for the last act of the
Super Star competition

1297
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:35,560
Our favourite winner

1298
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:39,760
Our Junior Aryan Khanna

1299
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:44,920
He's a criminal!

1300
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:46,720
Get him off the stage

1301
01:50:56,680 --> 01:50:57,760
Calm down

1302
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:59,920
It's not the real Aryan Khanna

1303
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,040
It's our very own superstar...

1304
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:04,280
Gaurav Chandna

1305
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:05,400
Give him a big hand!

1306
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:42,040
I do a show for Aryan every year

1307
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:45,520
I know, Aunty. You cheer the loudest

1308
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:47,800
But this year's show...

1309
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,200
The show today is for...

1310
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:52,960
...someone else

1311
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:56,640
The girl over there who is...

1312
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:58,920
...smiling at me. She's my friend

1313
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:01,120
Neha!

1314
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,160
Come, babes

1315
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:12,800
There's something I've kept
in my heart for days

1316
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:17,280
I love you, Neha

1317
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:21,640
- I love you too, Aryan
- Not Aryan

1318
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:24,320
Gaurav loves you

1319
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:28,960
Gaurav loves Neha

1320
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:31,880
What nonsense!

1321
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:32,640
Get lost

1322
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:35,240
- He's nuts
- Thinks he's real Aryan Khanna

1323
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:36,280
Get him off

1324
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:39,720
Wait! He is talking to me.
I'll deal with it

1325
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:44,400
I love you!

1326
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:47,120
Drop it. You love only Aryan

1327
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:48,680
He can go to hell

1328
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:51,680
- Is that you talking?
- It's not just talk

1329
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:53,240
I've sent him to hell

1330
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:56,440
I fixed Aryan Khanna for good

1331
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:59,240
First in London, then in Dubrovnik

1332
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:02,200
I made my way into his house too

1333
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:07,760
Smashed everything in sight

1334
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:11,280
If you don't believe me, read the
papers. Watch TV or the Net

1335
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:14,920
Your Gaurav is famous the world over

1336
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:17,560
I'm no less than Aryan

1337
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:18,960
Not at all

1338
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:21,680
I am a star in real life

1339
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:25,320
Not a star. A monster

1340
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:26,400
What?

1341
01:53:26,680 --> 01:53:29,160
They all think you're a star

1342
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:31,240
While you shamed Inder Vihar

1343
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:32,600
Listen to her

1344
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,080
I became a monster for her

1345
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:36,960
I don't want to know a monster

1346
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:39,200
A monster! Forget it

1347
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:42,040
Take my hand and say:
"I love you too"

1348
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:43,440
- Let go
- I won't

1349
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:05,960
I'm very sorry, Neha

1350
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:07,120
Are you ok?

1351
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:08,160
Thank you

1352
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:11,120
Aryan. He's a good guy

1353
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:16,760
Gaurav!

1354
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:26,080
Get down!

1355
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:47,560
Enough!

1356
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:51,560
Enough of this game

1357
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:53,040
Get up!

1358
01:58:58,120 --> 01:58:59,400
I am happy in my life

1359
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:02,200
Can't you be happy in yours?

1360
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:07,000
Be a good son to your parents

1361
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:10,800
A good friend, a good boyfriend

1362
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:14,880
Stop being a fan

1363
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:23,760
What's the difference between us?

1364
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:27,080
I came from the same streets

1365
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:29,480
I had normal parents like you

1366
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:32,840
A regular house, regular school,
regular friends

1367
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:50,880
I made my way up alone

1368
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:54,680
Not in anyone's shadow

1369
01:59:57,720 --> 01:59:58,800
I'm human

1370
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:04,200
I laugh and cry, get mad like you.
I have a family. Responsibilities

1371
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:07,520
I don't have the time to meet
all my fans

1372
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:16,880
I'll say it again

1373
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:20,320
I'll forget all this

1374
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:22,560
You do the same

1375
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:24,840
Start over

1376
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:27,800
Not as Junior Aryan Khanna

1377
02:00:32,240 --> 02:00:33,960
See how it feels like to be
Gaurav Chandna

1378
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:39,000
Come!

1379
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:46,840
The joy of living as yourself...

1380
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:49,640
...cannot be matched by living
as another

1381
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:51,920
Stop now

1382
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:55,200
Live your life

1383
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:57,680
Let me live mine

1384
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:07,160
Where to, Senior?

1385
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:12,280
You destroyed me and ask me
to let you live your life?

1386
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,440
And my life?

1387
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:21,400
You took everything from me

1388
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:25,000
My parents' love

1389
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:27,400
Neha's friendship

1390
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:31,440
My neighbours' smiles

1391
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:42,160
You were my lifeline, Senior

1392
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:46,080
You cut the connection

1393
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:50,520
OK. I'll do as you say

1394
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:54,320
I'll stop this game

1395
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:01,360
I can separate myself from you

1396
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:07,360
But you can never separate
my name from yours

1397
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:15,280
You said everything

1398
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:20,000
But you never said sorry

1399
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:25,960
Gaurav!

1400
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:27,600
No, Gaurav

1401
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:29,720
It's not over

1402
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:31,600
Think of your parents

1403
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:34,800
Stop this madness

1404
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:55,320
Forget it. You won't understand

1405
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:41,160
Aryan Khanna has cleared
his name completely

1406
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:45,120
But Inder Vihar's Gaurav Chandna...

1407
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:48,520
...has tied his name to superstar
Aryan's name forever

1408
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:52,480
A wave of love greets Aryan's
on his birthday today

1409
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:57,240
Fans are singing his songs. They're
here in their thousands

1410
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:00,000
It's time

1411
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:04,920
Everyone is waiting
